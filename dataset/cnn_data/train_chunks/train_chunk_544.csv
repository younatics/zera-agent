This is the moment a group of shocked tourists were almost flattened by a humpback whale's enormous tail as it splashed down metres from their boat. Two of the gigantic creatures were swimming slowly down the northwestern coast feeding on krill when one made a spectacular dive deep into the ocean. Its large tail fin - known as a fluke - arced out of the sea and over the startled whale watchers' flimsy rubber dinghy.

Professional photographer Tony Beck, from Ottawa, Canada, captured the astonishing moment at the Antarctic Peninsula from another boat . Mr Beck, a 58-year-old tour guide, said: 'I've learned to expect the unexpected - those on the boat were smiling, many cheered and laughed.' It's dinner time!

Mr Beck added: 'The whales mostly just came to the surface, released their breath with a big blow, then submerged themselves for a minute or so. 'But after repeating this many times while feeding, they eventually arched their back and dove. 'Whenever I see humpback whales doing this I know that their tail follows them out of the water.

The two-man single-engined Robinson R22 pitched into a field behind Lancaster Way Business Park, Ely, Cambridgeshire just before lunchtime. Emergency teams were called at 11.27am to reports that an aircraft carrying one person had crash landed. Crash site: A man died when his helicopter crashed near Cambridge just before lunchtime . It is believed that the helicopter left Kent and headed for Spalding in Lincolnshire. The company provides . pilot training for private and commercial licences. A man was walking his dog when the helicopter crashed just 15 yards from where he stood. Pat Masterson, in his 40s, was today recovering from shock after attempting to pull the pilot from the wreckage. Clare Blair, 54, a mum-of-three and a member of Orchard Park Community Council from Cambridge said the man - her daughter's partner - was walking his four-month-old border collie when the aircraft crashed. She said: 'My daughter's partner was walking his puppy when the helicopter crashed just 15 yards from where they stood. 'There was one man in the helicopter and he tried to help him. He then ran to a cottage nearby and rang the emergency services. 'A farmer also came to help and the elderly woman who lives in the cottage. It was a very serious crash and traumatic for everyone involved. 'My daughter's partner is in shock and has gone to bed. I went to collect the puppy because it was distressed. 'It is very tragic, you feel for the family.' Debris: The aircraft is believed to be a Robinson R22 two seater, single engined helicopter and was being flown solo from Kent to Lincolnshire . Cambridgeshire Constabulary confirmed that a man from Kent died in the crash and his next of kin have been informed. Speaking from the field where the fatal helicopter crash took place, Chief Insp Dave Sargent said: 'The wreckage will be removed from the field sometime tomorrow afternoon. 'The debris from the crash is spread out over about half-a-mile and the blades have come off the helicopter. 'The helicopter appears to have flipped over and is lying on its topside. 'The fire service were called as a precaution because some aviation fluid had leaked from the aircraft. 'We will be using emergency lighting to illuminate the area over night.'

Nothing they could do: Emergency services at the Cambridgeshire airfield - but they were unable to save the pilot . A police spokesman added: 'I can confirm that the only person on board, a man, has died in the crash. 'His next of kin in Kent have been informed and officers are providing them with support. 'I am not in a position to name the man as formal identification has not been completed. 'No one on the ground was injured. And no roads have been affected. 'The crash site has been secured pending an investigation by the Air Accidents Investigation Bureau (AAIB).' A cordon was placed around the crash site until the AAIB had completed its investigations. Other eye witnesses yesterday (Fri) claimed they heard a loud bang before the 'lifeless' helicopter plummeted to the ground. John Binns, 29, a factory worker said: 'I came out of the warehouse and saw the helicopter in the air. 'It then just started dropping to the ground. it looked so odd and lifeless. 'At first I thought it might be a model but then people started rushing towards the field and I knew it was a real helicopter.'

A Christmas break in a luxurious cottage by the Severn probably seemed like a good idea at the time. But it turned into a nightmare for the Hughes family when the river burst its banks and they were stranded indoors for a week looking out at waist-deep water before eventually being rescued by boat. Simon Hughes, 44, and his extended family – a total of eight adults, four children and a dog – had paid about £2,500 for a week in The Ferryman’s Cottage in the hamlet of Uckinghall near Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire. Marooned: Eight adults, four children and a dog all had to be rescued from this holiday home, surrounded by floodwater in the hamlet of Uckinghall, near Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, after they were stranded for a week by floods . Safety: Two of the stranded party, Becky and Linda, look relieved as they are finally led to safety from the holiday home where they had been marooned for seven days . It was the first reunion in 20 . years of all the family members, one of whom is a diabetic who only had . enough insulin for a week. Ominously, . within hours of their arrival on December 22 the fields surrounding the . seven-bedroom, four-bathroom cottage began to fill with water. Mr . Hughes, a technical author, said: ‘When we arrived I had no inkling we . were in a flood zone. We didn’t know the Severn had breached its banks. We were due to stay for a week and I thought we’d be taking lots of . walks. ‘There was a five-bar gate on the edge of the property and by the morning we could only see four bars. 'We only had 20 yards of grass in the back garden to play with, the rest was just submerged. It was about 10ft at the deepest. ‘Four hundred yards of land around us went down to just 100 yards and then all the fields disappeared.’ Heading towards dry land: Members of a family stranded at a holiday cottage over Christmas are pictured being led to dry land by a team of rescuers . Submerged: A team of rescuers needed a boat to reach a family marooned at a luxury holiday cottage near Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, over Christmas . Mr Hughes was with his partner Lecia Watts, his children Alex, ten, and Charlie, two, his diabetic father Terry, 72, and his partner, Linda. Simon’s mother Pam, 71, also arrived along with his sister Becky Stevens, 47, her husband John and their children Ben, 11, and Meghan, ten. Simon’s aunt Kris also joined the group with the family dog Peggy, a seven-year-old Patterdale Terrier. The family had little option but to make the most of their time together indoors, playing board games, treasure hunts and Headbands, where they had to guess names written on bits of paper and stuck to their foreheads. But on Christmas Eve, after two days of solid rain, they were going ‘totally mad,’ according to Mr Hughes. As a result, he and his brother-in-law John decided to brave the waters in the dark, armed with torches and wellies, to try to reach a pub. After wading through the waist-deep water, they eventually made it and described their plight to locals who lent the family a boat so a couple of them at a time could leave the cottage to go for supplies while a rescue was planned. The family were finally taken to dry land on Saturday when the West Midlands Search and Rescue Service arrived with two boats. Putting on a brave face: Despite being marooned over Christmas, the family tried to keep their spirits up by playing parlour games .

The vintage aircraft, famed for its use by the RAF during the Second World War, blew its front wheel as it touched down at East Midlands Airport. While the aircraft’s pilot, the only person on board, emerged unscathed, his plane was stranded on the runway. Crash: The undercarriage of a Spitfire collapsed on landing which caused flight delays and the closure of East Midlands Airport for several hours . The vintage aircraft, famed for its use by the RAF during the Second World War, blew its front wheel as it touched down, pictured . Other flights approaching had to be diverted to nearby Birmingham, as emergency crews cleared the obstruction. News of the crash caused bewilderment, with many joking that they thought they had mistakenly been given news from more than half a century ago. Author Jenny Colgan wrote on Twitter: ‘PLEASE let it be time travel.’ Rob Kerry added: ‘They need to get some newer planes up norf!’ The historic war plane – believed to be a Rolls Royce Spitfire G-RRGN from the airport’s private collection - suffered landing gear failure when it touched down on the runway just after 3.20pm today. Flights out of East Midlands Airport had to be suspended for three-and-a-half hours while others were diverted to nearby Birmingham International. Passengers spoke of how the crash caused ‘bedlam’, forcing inconvenient diversions. One, named Sarah, had her flight from Belfast diverted to Birmingham. She wrote online: ‘Flight has been diverted to Birmingham. What a nightmare! Vintage Spitfire emergency landing. Everything has been diverted to here. It is bedlam.’ The Super Marine Spitfire which crash-landed after its undercarriage collapsed at East Midlands Airport this afternoon . A spokeswoman for the airport said: ‘The undercarriage of the plane came off after it landed. ‘We have our own on-site fire service - which is a standard regulation - who dealt with the incident swiftly. ‘All flights had to be suspended while the aircraft was recovered from the runway. There were no injuries and flights were diverted to Birmingham in the meantime.’ A spokeswoman for Leicestershire Police added: ‘We were notified by the fire service of the incident but didn't attend. ‘We were called at 3.22pm with a report of an aircraft that had suffered an undercarriage failure.’ Plane spotter Edward Cockson, who witnessed the incident, said: 'I was looking at the plane coming in from the motorway end and all of a sudden there was loads of blue lights. 'I got my binoculars out and saw that it had landed on the runway. It was tilted forward but it was intact. 'Radio hams then picked up messages from the airport that said the pilot was fine. There was a couple of fire engines but no fire. 'A couple of Canadian visitors had been watching planes coming in and taking off and they were amazed when I told them the plane involved was a Spitfire.' The UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said it was aware of the incident and had launched an investigation. A formation of Spitfire Mark XIIs, the first Rolls-Royce Griffon engine-powered Spitfire to enter service with the RAF . The plane was described by an EMA spokesman as a Rolls-Royce Spitfire, number PS853, based at the airport. It was originally an unarmed, . high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft, one of a batch of 79 Mk XIXs . built at Supermarine, Southampton. The Mk XIX was powered by the 2,050 . hp Griffon 65 or 66 and represents the pinnacle of the Spitfire’s . development in terms of speed and altitude capability with a top speed . of 446mph and a ceiling of 42,000ft. PS853 was delivered to the Central . Photographic Reconnaissance Unit at RAF Benson on 13th January 1945, . before moving to Belgium and Holland. The aircraft was engaged on active . service with 16 Squadron up until the end of the war and participated in . 'Operation Crossbow' to detect V1 and V2 'vengeance weapon' launch . sites. At the end of the war it remained on duty in Germany until March1946 when it returned to the UK and was placed in storage. In 1950, PS853 was one of several Mk XIX Spitfires selected for conversion to conduct meteorological research. It flew its last official sortie on 10th June 1957 and retired into ceremonial and display duties to form the RAF’s Historic Aircraft Flight, the forerunner of today’s Battle of Britain Memorial Flight (BBMF). In 1996, Rolls-Royce bought PS853 to replace the original Rolls-Royce Spitfire XIV, G-ALGT which had been destroyed in a crash in 1992. The Rolls-Royce Spitfire, as PS853 is now popularly known, has become widely recognised as an ambassador for Rolls-Royce appearing at air displays and charity events. The aircraft is based in a dedicated hangar at East Midlands Airport, near Derby. It can usually be seen around the display circuit between April and October and during the winter months the aircraft undergoes an annual maintenance inspection programme.","WWII aircraft blew its front wheel as it touched down after 3.20pm today .

The boy who was taken on the run by his mother to spare him the ordeal of radiotherapy yesterday finally began the potentially life-saving cancer treatment. Neon Roberts, seven, who was diagnosed with a brain tumour in October, had urgent radiotherapy put on hold while his mother, Sally, fought a high profile legal battle to be allowed to pursue alternative treatments instead for her son. Mrs Roberts, 37, had objected to Neon receiving radiotherapy because she feared it could cause him to suffer serious side effects such as stunted growth and infertility, which would prevent her from having grandchildren. Neon Roberts, seven, who was diagnosed with a brain tumour in October, had urgent radiotherapy put on hold while his mother, Sally, fought a high profile legal battle to be allowed to pursue alternative treatments . But three weeks ago a High Court judge dismissed her case after doctors advised that the child would die within three months if he was denied the 'gold standard' treatment. Yesterday, Neon had his first round of radiotherapy after he completed a course of play therapy and a practise run on Wednesday to prepare him. While Mrs Roberts suggested in the past that she would appeal the High Court's decision, no such appeal was made by her lawyers before Neon's treatment began. Mrs Roberts told the Mail she remained '100 per cent' against radiotherapy being given to her son. ‘I have seen pictures of Neon having the play therapy [to prepare him for radiotherapy]. It is heartbreaking,' she added. Neon was taken to hospital yesterday by his father, Ben, with whom he has been living since his mother was found by police on the run with her son. Mrs Roberts told the Mail she remained '100 per cent' against radiotherapy being given to her son . Mrs Roberts previously said she would not be able to cope with seeing her son being taken to hospital for radiotherapy. 'I will cry that day. I won't be able to sleep the night before. I don't know if I could actually take him there. I don't know how I will mentally cope or manage to do it,' she said. Neon was first diagnosed two months ago with a medulloblastoma tumour, which doctors believed they had removed in full on October 25. Neon was first diagnosed two months ago with a medulloblastoma tumour, which doctors believed they had removed in full on October 25 . They then wished to start radiotherapy . treatment but his mother became convinced this was not the best course . of action after a specialist told her the treatment would 'fry' Neon's . brain. After going on the run with her son on December 2 and being found by the police four days later, Mrs Roberts argued her case in the High Court. The court's decision, however, was delayed after MRI scans showed a 1.5cm squared growth in the cavity from where Neon's original tumour was removed. Mrs Roberts then objected to further surgery to remove the cancer, leading to the High Court ordering the surgery and then radiotherapy against her wishes. Mrs Roberts provided the court with a list of alternative treatments to radiotherapy but these were ridiculed by medical experts, who said treating him in any other way would be 'unethical'. A combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy gives young patients up to an 86 per cent chance of survival, the court heard. But delays in Neon's treatment meant his chances of surviving have already been reduced to 67 per cent. After the court ruled radiotherapy must be performed, Mr Justice Bodey said he was worried Mrs Roberts's judgment had 'gone awry'. 'I have become concerned about the mother's attitude to Neon's welfare generally,' he said. 'The mother has been through a very stressful time. This sort of news is every parent's worst nightmare, and I have sympathy for her, but I'm worried that her judgment was gone awry on the question of the seriousness of the threat which Neon faces.' Battle: Neon started radiotherapy treatment yesterday despite his mother's legal bid . He added that Neon must have the treatment because 'one cannot enjoy a quality of life if one isn't alive'. An order was put into place by the court ensuring Neon lives with his father during the course of his treatment and Mrs Roberts, who spent Christmas away from her son and his twin sister, Elektra, is prohibited from removing Neon from her estranged husband's care. Mr Roberts, who was said to be 'relieved' after the judge's decision, was unavailable for comment last night. Mrs Roberts, who threatened to sue if Neon suffers adverse reactions to radiotherapy, plans to continue to fight to be allowed to provide alternative treatments for Neon alongside radiotherapy and chemotherapy.","Neon Roberts completed a practise .

Detectives believe the attack may have been a robbery gone wrong or a case of mistaken identity. Maureen Greaves, 63, told The Sun last night: 'There was no motive. We are devastated. 'It is just not what you expect, somebody to walk down the street and get murdered - and at this time of year as well, it’s just dreadful.' Community worker Mrs Greaves, 63, said she ‘wants justice, but not vengeance’ over her husband’s death. ‘Life sometimes produces things like this. It’s a shame but you have to look for the good,’ she said. Mr Greaves, a retired social worker, leaves four children and two grandchildren. Grief: Local residents lay flowers at the scene in High Green, Sheffield, where Mr Greaves was found collapsed on the pavement . Organist: Mr Greaves was on his way to St Saviour's CoE Church in High Green to play the organ when he was attacked . He had been an organist and lay preacher at St Saviour’s for nine years. He also regularly played piano for the . children at a local primary school and, with his wife, had set up a . food bank and community project in High Green. Mr Greaves left his home at about 11pm on Christmas Eve for the short walk to the church. Fifteen minutes later, with the canon . and congregation becoming increasingly concerned, he was found collapsed . across a kerb outside a primary school by a pizza delivery worker. He was taken to Northern General Hospital in Sheffield and had four hours of emergency surgery but never recovered. Police are yet to determine what weapon was used by his attacker. Paying respects: Local reverend and friend Simon Bessant said the community in High Green is 'deeply shocked and traumatised' by the murder of Mr Greaves . Home: Grandfather Alan Greaves, 68, had left his house on Greengate Lane and was walking to St Saviour's church when he was set upon . Lovely man: Locals have been leaving floral tributes at the scene where Alan Greaves was found collapsed just 300 metres from St Savior's church where he was heading . Rev Canon Simon Bessant, from St . Saviour’s Church, said the community was ‘deeply shocked and traumatised . by the news’. He described Mr Greaves as a ‘gentle soul... a teddy bear . of a grandfather’. ‘He was a good man and this was an evil act. It was a senseless, wicked attack,’ he said. ‘I don’t think he could have had an enemy in the world, he didn’t have a violent bone in his body. ‘I had a phone call at 8am on Christmas morning, and I spent most of Christmas Day with the family in the hospital. ‘They have a strong faith but that . doesn’t mean you don’t feel the difficulty. It was a hard vigil by his . bedside, watching him struggle. 'His wife is not embittered but obviously she wants this person to be caught.’ He added: 'He wasn't foolish - he would have handled the situation as best as anyone would but we don't know what he encountered.' Disbelief: Alan Greaves, right, was a well-known figure in the community often playing the piano at church events with his wife Maureen Greaves, left . Community man: Grandfather Alan Greaves, 68, had been walking to St Saviour's church where he played the organ when he was attacked . Investigations: A murder investigation has been launched after Mr Greaves was found collapsed with severe head injuries near a primary school . Questions: Police speak to members of the local community which has been described as 'extremely shocked and traumatised' The Bishop of Sheffield, Dr Steven Croft, has sent a message to every parish in his diocese asking for prayers for Mr Greaves, his widow and their family. In it Dr Croft said: 'Alan Greaves died on Thursday night following injuries received in an attack on Christmas Eve as he was on his way to church. 'He was a Reader and organist at St Saviour's Mortomley and High Green in Sheffield. 'He was married to Maureen, a Church Army Evangelist and both Alan and Maureen were widely involved in serving their local community for many years. They have four grown up children. 'Please would you hold Alan's family and the church family at High Green, with Simon Bessant the Vicar and the wider family of Church Army in your prayers in the coming days and especially this Sunday morning. Mr Greaves was found collapsed on the pavement on Greengate Lane just 300 metres from St Saviour's church where he was heading on Christmas Eve . Upset: Friend and colleague Reverend Simon Bessant from St Saviours C of E Church lays flowers where Mr Greaves' was murdered . Gentle: Mr Greaves has been described as 'a gentle giant' who 'didn't have an enemy in the world' 'I plan to be with the congregation at High Green on Sunday morning. Mrs Greaves, an evangelist with the . Church Army, said she and her husband met in 1970, when both were . training to be childcare officers. Family friends said Mr Greaves was pacifist who ‘believed in forgiveness and understanding’. Detective Superintendent Matt Fenwick of South Yorkshire Police described the murder as a ‘brutal attack’. ‘Alan Greaves’s family were looking forward to spending Christmas together but instead, they are distraught,’ he said.

Worrying: Sally Roberts, 37, who went on the run to prevent her son being given radiotherapy revealed last night the heartbreaking news that his tumour has regrown . The mother who went on the run to prevent her son being given radiotherapy  revealed last night the heartbreaking news that his tumour has regrown. But while Sally Roberts, 37, had said she would relent and allow seven-year-old Neon to have the treatment if the cancer returned, yesterday she said she was ‘50/50 still’. ‘It’s all up in the air,’ she said. ‘I don’t want my boy to have radiotherapy because of the side effects. I still think Neon does not need it. ‘I will continue to do research. If I can find any doctor who says he does not need it I will continue to fight.’ Mrs Roberts, 37, sparked a nationwide hunt ten days ago when she went on the run with Neon, who had an operation to remove a large brain tumour in October. The mother of two disappeared after a doctor told her radiotherapy was needed to ‘fry his brain’ to make sure the cancer did not return. Authorities tracked them down last Thursday. Neon is now being looked after by his father, Mrs Roberts’s estranged husband, Ben. Mrs Roberts has since been fighting a high-profile legal battle with two hospitals to stop them giving Neon the treatment, arguing that he should be healed with alternative therapies instead. Mr Roberts believes he should have conventional treatment. Yesterday, doctors told Neon’s parents that cancer had returned to the area where the previous medulloblastoma tumour was removed during a nine-hour operation on October 25. A one centimetre mass was spotted after an MRI scan on Friday, and while Mrs Roberts was hopeful this would turn out to be harmless, further tests performed on Monday afternoon confirmed the worst. It is now 48 days since Neon’s first operation, just one day from the 49-day deadline when radiotherapy must begin or a patient’s chance of survival is significantly reduced. The little boy now needs further surgery to remove the regrowth and courses of chemotherapy and radiotherapy – although Mrs Roberts is seeking second opinions on the scans before consenting. She and Mr Roberts were called to an urgent 45-minute meeting with a neurosurgeon yesterday. Sad: Neon Roberts, 7, pictured, is suffering from a recurrence of his brain tumour, his mother revealed last night . Afterwards, Mrs Roberts told the Daily . Mail: ‘It is dreadful, it is really awful. It does seem to be a one . centimetre regrowth and they want to do more surgery. ‘But the doctors are saying it is not too bad. It is in the big cavity where the last tumour was so it could be a lot worse. Everyone is very positive about it.’ Mrs Roberts fears that radiotherapy will cause devastating side effects, such as infertility and reduced IQ. But while she had previously said she would allow doctors to perform radiotherapy if the cancer returned, she now says she will seek further medical opinions. Sally Roberts, 37, pictured left, has been . battling with her estranged husband, Ben, 34, pictured right, over the . treatment of their son Neon . She added that she particularly wanted to continue the legal battle for other mothers in her position, who she believes should have the right to stop their children being given possibly unnecessary radiotherapy if their cancers have been removed in full by surgery. A High Court judgment on whether Mrs Roberts could prevent her son having radiotherapy was adjourned on Saturday. It will make its ruling next Tuesday, following updated medical reports.","Sally Roberts, 37, sparked a nationwide .

Alex Kosuth-Phillips, 23, who was celebrating his birthday with his girlfriend, had to have surgery and metal plates inserted into his jaw following the assault in Selly Oak, Birmingham.

'It was traumatic then and it's traumatic now': Mr Kosuth-Phillips says the attack was entirely unprovoked . The sales assistant from Chester, who was visiting his student girlfriend in Birmingham when he was attacked on February 25 last year, had to live off coleslaw and mashed potato for three months and lost two stone. He said: 'I had been out celebrating my birthday with my girlfriend, and we went into the shop to order a pizza. 'All I remember is walking into the pizza parlour and there were two of them [the attacker and his friend] sat on the left hand side. 'One of them said something to my girlfriend, I asked what he said and he started swearing, becoming abusive and mocking my ginger hair.' 'He swore at me and called me a ""ginger pr**k"".'

Best friends: The clever and sociable dog and his handler PC Matt Holding are the most successful partnership of 2012 . Scroll down for video . He has battled rioting yobs, found a missing girl and has an unrivalled record for the number of arrests he has made this year. And the police officer who looks after Visco the dog isn’t bad at his job either. The four-year-old German shepherd, pictured in training, is said to be Britain’s best police dog after making 142 arrests in 2012 alongside his handler. Among those Visco has snared is an English Defence League protester who smashed a female police officer over the back of her head. The dog was kicked and punched in the process of detaining the culprit, but avoided serious injury. Last month, he used his impeccable tracking skills to find a missing girl who had wandered off after a serious car crash. ‘I have an exceptional bond with Visco,’ said PC Matt Holding, of Staffordshire Police, who was partnered with Visco in 2009. ‘We depend on each other. We know each other’s strengths and weaknesses and we know our limits. But he can be frustrating sometimes. A dog’s mental capacity is a bit like that of an 18-month-old baby, it constantly wants attention. He just wants to work all the time. 'A dog's mental capacity is a bit like that of an 18-month-old baby, it . constantly wants attention. But he is one of the family.' The German Shepherd lives in kennels at the home of dog support unit inspector PC Chris Dawson and his partner Jo Willis, who is also a dog handler looks and after Solo. The couple met through the unit in 2008 and now have three . daughters, Millie, eight, Hattie, five, and Isla, three. Last month Visco and PC Holding, who lives with his partner were awarded a Divisional Commendation Award for their sterling work. Visco, who will be five years old in February, lives outside their house with Solo, but the competitive canines have a slightly strained relationship, despite being friendly dogs. It was by chance that Visco formed his winning partnership with PC Holding. The officer was originally assigned to another dog when he joined the unit in . 2008, but the animal was sent to the military because of behavioural problems. Solving mysteries: Visco has always held the advanced licence, which judges the pair on the dog's obedience and the control the handler has over the animal . PC Holdingand Visco trained for three months together before they were ready for action and the dogs licence is now reissued each year. He has always held the advanced licence, which judges the pair on the . dog's obedience and the control the handler has over the dog. Together they have experienced an array of testing situations, . but one in particular stands out for PC Holding. He said: 'Back in 2009 we were called to attend an English Defence . League march in Hanley, Stoke-on Trent where more than 100 members were . involved. 'We were being attacked from the front and back as well as trying to . protect some of the officers when a male protester struck a female . officer on the back of the head. 'I monitored him until I saw him get out of hand again. Then I deployed Visco to detain him. Pure talent: Dog support inspector Chris Dawson puts Visco through his paces. The clever dog has detained and arrested almost one criminal every three days . 'Visco was kicked and punched in the process but luckily he wasn't . injured seriously and was able to detain the offender who was then . arrested and convicted for violent disorder. 'I think he was given two-and-a-half years in the end and the judge . commended mine and Visco's bravery. I think that has been the biggest . demand on the pair of us just because of the sheer volatility of the . people involved.' Only last week, they had another success in finding a missing girl. PC Holding said: 'She was in a serious car crash and sustained injuries but . managed to get out and wander off before we could get there. 'Visco was able to track and we got her back safe and sound. Without the dog, it would have taken a lot longer. 'It can take a dog just 30 minutes to pick up a track but obviously it . depends on the circumstances. I find tracking the most rewarding because . it heavily relies on you as a team.' Tough cookie: Visco was kicked and punched during an English Defence League protest - but managed to detain the offender, who was convicted for violent disorder . 'You realise how having a dog helps solve so many more crimes. Without a police dog you perhaps wouldn't catch as many suspects. 'For the Visco it's fun, training and work is like playing in the park for him. 'For everything he does successfully I reward him with a ball or something like that. Rarely a snack though.' Together they work shift patterns of six days on, four days off in one . of the most successful police dog support units in the country. PC Holding suggested their success could be due to the area they cover and type of crimes that are committed. The unit also consists of 12 specialist dogs, who are trained to search for a variety of substances and articles. Some are trained to search for explosives only and are used to scan . suspicious packages and carry out searches of areas prior to the arrival . of persons such as Ministers and the Royal Family. On the scent: Just last week, the duo had another success in finding a missing girl and bringing her home . Other dogs are used to search for drugs and firearms. Some have additional skills to search for cash. So far this year, the unit has carried out 365 searches for drugs, firearms and cash. One dog in particular, Springer Spaniel Alfie, has had immense success along with handler PC Julie Hargreaves. This year, Alfie's best finds include a single stash of cannabis to the . value of £150,000 and £200,000 cash hidden in a car. The vehicle had . been searched several times by police officers and it was not until . Alfie had a go that the cash was found in a secret location. PC Holding and Visco were awarded the Divisional Commendation Award last . Tuesday for their good work, continued excellent performance, . motivation and achievement. PC Dawson said: 'In training Visco . fares very well in comparison to the other dogs, especially with the . guidance of his handler. They really put the practice in and we're . really proud.'","The law-enforcing hound has detained at least one criminal every three days .

It's a festive phenomenon that saves youngsters money and keeps Mum and Dad in the technological loop. This Christmas saw the rise of the ‘hand-me-up’ gift – when children pass on the still-desirable, hi-tech gadgets they don’t want any more to their parents. A survey found over a quarter of us gave second-hand technology to our mothers and fathers. Hand-me-up: A generation of parents have 'inherited' discarded gadgets, such as smartphones and tablet devices, from their children this Christmas . The trend was even more apparent among . young adults, with nearly half of those aged 18-24 passing on used . gadgets such as smartphones, cameras, iPods and Kindle e-readers. Of the 2,000 people questioned, the . most common reason for giving a hand-me-up was that old gadgets were . outdated (and newer ones might be sitting in  Christmas stockings), . while a third said they gave such gifts because cash was tight. One in ten gave old smartphones to parents so they could log on to social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter. Women buyers were more likely to pass . on an old phone to a parent, while men were more likely to give the . hand-me-ups to a friend instead. Young adults largely chose to give . their cast-offs to their mothers. Some 44 per cent of mums received old . gadgets, compared with 28 per cent of dads. Grandparents, however, opened  more . conventional presents on Christmas Day, with just 4 per cent of . grandchildren giving hand-me-ups to that generation. Sylvia Chind, from mobile operator . Three, which carried out the survey, said the ‘hand-me-ups’ would ‘save . time and money’, and expose older generations to more up-to-date . technology. She said: ‘This research has found . that Brits are making the most of their older technology and connecting . Mum and Dad, siblings and friends to the  mobile internet.’ Generational gap: A survey of 2,000 people revealed that more than a quarter of us gave outdated gadgets to parents as gifts over the festive season . Sales of electronic gadgets are, naturally, very high before Christmas with the market for new smartphones almost doubling in December. Women buyers are more likely to pass on an older smartphone to a parent, with men more often giving the ‘hand-me-ups’ to a friend instead. While much has been written in recent years about ‘silver surfing’ older people, the survey found grandparents were not particularly likely to have been given old gadgets. Just 4 per cent of people interviews said they had passed on ‘hand-me-ups’ to their grandmother or grandfather. American youth marketing experts Buzz Marketing Group put ‘hand-me-ups’ as their fifth top trend in 2012. Chief executive Tina Wells said: ‘The hand-me-up trend implies that the older generation is actually being exposed to newer technology faster than we had previously believed. Recycled: Almost half of those in the 18-24 age group said they gave ‘hand-me-ups’, including smartphones and cameras, to relatives for Christmas . ‘They might not be as updated [as their children] but tech-saviness is definitely being facilitated amongst Generation X and beyond.’ Previous studies have found that mobile phones are the most popular ‘hand-me-ups’, followed by mp3 players, including iPods. In a recent survey commissioned by Intel, almost half of 502 students surveyed said they had passed on an old piece of technology to their mother or father. Young adults are more likely to give ‘the hand-me-ups’ to their mothers than their fathers, though. 44 per cent of mothers said they had received the old gadgets, compared to 28 per cent of fathers. Sylvia Chind, Head of Devices at Three said the ‘hand-me-ups’ would ‘save family and friends time and money’. She added: ‘Christmas is a time for giving and this research has found that Brits are making the most of their older technology and connecting Mum and Dad, siblings and friends to the mobile internet.’","Survey of 2,000 finds quarter of people gave old technology to parents .

Prince William, seen here with a black rhino, was struck by the rhinos' plight on his gap year . The Duke of Cambridge has called for a halt to the killing of rhinos for their horns as experts warn that Africa is facing the worst poaching crisis in decades. The Lewa Wildlife Conservancy in Kenya, where William proposed to Kate Middleton in 2010, reported five slaughtered rhinos in a fortnight last month - and says that the lucrative poaching trade poses a 'grave threat' to the already endangered species. A St James's Palace spokesman said: 'The Duke is concerned that action must be taken now to stem the tide before it is too late and these magnificent creatures become lost to the wild forever. 'Species conservation is something the Duke feels passionate about.  He has been keeping a close eye on the poaching crisis, particularly involving Africa's rhinoceros and elephants, and is alarmed by the increase in the numbers being killed.' The most recent spate of killings occurred at Lewa, a 62,000-acre sanctuary where the Duke spent part of his gap year.  They reported the shootings of five black rhinos in December, and says thieves got away with two sets of horns. Rhino horns are highly prized for perceived medicinal benefits, and used against a variety of complaints including cancer and hangovers.  It is particularly popular in the Far East, where it can sell for around £20,000 a pound, making it more valuable than gold. A Kenyan can sell a single rhino horn for the equivalent of a year's salary, which makes it an attractive proposition for would-be hunters in the country.  Ivory from elephants' tusks is also prized. As a result, the poachers are becoming more and more sophisticated, despite the animal sanctuaries' best efforts. Lewa, which is home to 126 white and black rhinos, was founded in 1995 and had not lost a rhino to poachers until 2009, when a female was gunned down near the border with Ngare Ndare Forest.  Since then,  a total of 11 have been slaughtered by poachers. A Lewa spokeswoman said: '2012 was our blackest year.  The severity and frequency of these attacks is a clear indication of the level of threat that Lewa's rhinos face, the highest in history. Britain's Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, feeds a 5-year-old black rhino called Zawadi as he visits Port Lympne Wild Animal Park . 'The poacher is no longer a long gunman with a mask; the hefty price paid for African rhino horn has attracted international organised crime syndicates that are eager to cash in at the expense of an entire species. 'Poachers have become increasingly sophisticated, using the latest gadgets and intelligence to spot and kill rhinos.' Lewa is one of the best protected sanctuaries in Africa, with 150 wildlife rangers, many of them armed, patrolling the vast reserve 24 hours a day. Mike Watson, the sanctuary's chief executive, said security was being stepped up in the wake of the attacks. Slaughtered: Rhinos are killed, usually shot, by poachers who can sell their horns for the equivalent of several months' salary . He said: 'Lewa is now more than ever determined to counter these threats by increasing our security and monitoring efforts.' A World Wildlife Fund rhino expert said the poachers would wipe out the endangered species if they were not stopped.  They said at least 593 rhinos were slaughtered in Africa last year. Dr Joseph Okori, WWF's rhino programme leader, said: 'The rhino faces extinction within 10 years if we do not reverse this trend. 'Villagers are at the bottom of the chain and can earn several months' income through two or three days' poaching. 'Huge amounts of money are in circulation.' WWF-UK's Drew McVey said: 'Since 2010, there have been successive record highs in the numbers of rhinos being poached each year. 'We need urgent action to tackle this trade, with governments working together to address the problem globally, as it won’t be solved by any one country on its own.' Charlie Mayhew, chief executive of Tusk Trust, which the Duke of Cambridge became a patron of following his visits to Lewa, said: 'There are real alarm bells ringing. 'It is Kenya's economic assets that are also being hit, not just the animals.' The WWF estimates that there are currently around 4,838 black rhinos, most of them in South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Kenya.  Fifty years ago, there were 70,000.","Kenyan sanctuary where he proposed to Kate Middleton reports record number of killings .

The Harvard University graduate went on to study at Oxford before heading to Washington. Political expertise: Michele Flournoy has years of experience in the defense field . She holds a Master of Letters postgraduate degree from Oxford, where she was a Newton-Tatum scholar at Balliol College. She has spent two decades climbing to . the top of the notoriously male-dominated US national security . establishment, winning the admiration of politicians and military . chiefs. After working in the Pentagon under . Bill Clinton, Mrs Flournoy returned in the department’s No 3 position — . undersecretary of defence for policy — when Mr Obama began his first . term in 2009. She resigned last February, saying she wanted to spend more time with her three children. But now she is being heavily tipped to return, this time in the top spot. ‘She’d be a terrific appointment. She’s incredibly competent, smart and really loved by everyone who works . for her,’ said James Mann, who wrote a book on the President’s foreign . policy advisers called The Obamians. Outgoing Defense chief: Leon Panetta is expected to announce his retirement soon .

Travellers cleared from Dale Farm after a lengthy legal battle have said they want to replace it with a new site more than twice the size. They want to build more than 100 new pitches on the green belt land in Crays Hill, Essex, which they say is now contaminated anyway. News of the plans comes just 15 months after Basildon Council and Essex Police spent £7.1m evicting around 80 families from the six-acre site. Covered in rubbish: Following the eviction, Dale Farm became a target for fly-tippers and is now covered in old mattresses, washing machines and rubbish . Now the council, which had promised to restore it to greenbelt land, has been consulted by a campaigner for the travellers on what has been dubbed a 'supersite' at Dale Farm. The new scheme would involve redeveloping all 51 demolished pitches and creating 20 temporary pitches along Oak Road where touring caravans are currently illegally parked. There would also be 40 upgraded neighbouring legal pitches. If approved, the site would be more than . twice the size of the illegal development which stood in the town for . more than a decade. Today Basildon Council confirmed that . Stuart Hardwicke-Carruthers, a campaigner for the travellers, had made . extensive enquiries into submitting the radical plan. A council spokesman said: 'Mr . Hardwicke-Carruthers has requested the council's opinion as to whether . an environmental impact assessment would need to be carried out prior to . the possible submission of a planning application for the proposed . development of a 111-pitch gypsy and traveller site on land he refers to . as being Dale Farm. Battlefield in the green belt: This aerial photo shows what was Europe's biggest illegal traveller site shortly after it was cleared, with the legal site next door . Popular site: Following the eviction, many travellers simply parked along the lane leading to Dale Farm . 'It should be stressed that no planning application has been submitted. 'The council has three weeks from the submission date of the request to provide its opinion. 'The consideration of this request does not affect the planning position or Green Belt status of the land.' Mr Hardwicke-Carruthers, who advises the travellers' legal team, claims that . concreting over the land and using it as traveller pitches is the only . viable option for the potentially-contaminated site. He said: 'Because the land is now . contaminated with hazardous substances, the most sensible option will be . to cap it with a concrete base and the only real potential use becomes . another traveller site. 'This . will not only deal with the environmental problems caused by the . clearance, but also meet the shortage of sites in the borough.' Tony Ball, Leader of Basildon Council, described the possible application as ‘ridiculous’. He said: 'Given the history of this site, and the number of legal challenges and decisions that have been made regarding Dale Farm, I find it ridiculous that Mr Carruthers could even consider submitting a planning application to redevelop the land. 'I, along with many local people, find it an insult that after a decade of persistent law-breaking and significant cost to the taxpayer to uphold the law, that this is even being suggested. 'He has learnt nothing from the Dale Farm issue, and this is clearly a publicity stunt that will just waste valuable council officer time. 'The site is within the green belt, and our green belt policy is clear, as is national planning policy. 'However, there is nothing the council can do to stop an individual submitting a speculative application whether they have a chance of implementing their plans or not.' Burning barricades: The eviction of Dale Farm in October 2011 involved police and council workers and cost taxpayers £7.1m . Neighbour Len Gridley, 54, whose house backs on to the illegal site, said: 'This is another ludicrous plan. 'There would be uproar if this got through and residents would make sure the whole council had to resign. 'Because of the amount of money spent on the eviction, to reinstate it would be madness.' The eviction, in October 2011, involved more than 300 police officers, as well as bailiffs and council workers, and some of the residents had to be forcibly removed. Many of the travellers who were evicted from the site in 2011 simply moved to a temporary camp 100 yards away. Basildon Council promised to turn the site back into greenbelt land, but more than a year on it appears as if nothing has been done, and fly-tipped rubbish covers the site. The results of an Environment Agency investigation into potentially dangerous pollutants - including asbestos and engine oil - allegedly dug up by council contractors during the eviction is expected within the coming weeks. Last month Basildon Council approved an application by the Irish Traveller Movement in Britain (ITMB) for a 15-pitch site in Gardiners Lane South, just a mile away from the Dale Farm site.","Six-acre site in Essex's green belt cleared 15 months ago in bitter scenes .

HIs team turned back two-thirds . of the way up as a result of deep, unconsolidated snow and a lack of . proper equipment for the upper wall. The following year set a new highpoint on the Fin at 6100m, but descended after one of the team broke both his legs. Anker made his . second attempt with Chin and Ozturk in 2008. Meru Peak is also the site of the world's highest BASE Jump from 'Earth'. In 2006 Australians Glenn Singleman & Heather Swan both wearing 'wing suits' - launched themselves off a 6604-metre high . precipice on Meru Peak after a 22-day climb. Their expedition . was made up of six climbers and nine porters. They covered 50 metres a day on icy slopes at 80 degree gradients and in temperatures of -20. The team was . delayed on the climb for several days during a storm but later they progressed beyond the highpoint of Anker's . 2003 attempt. But the team food supply had run short as a result of the storm and on their nineteenth day . they stopped about 150 metres below summit. Chin vowed never to return. The following year a Slovenian team attempted the . same route but the weather meant they were unable to acclimatise on practise routes first. Nevertheless, they decided to press ahead. After the two-day approach the team . turned aback, citing a lack of proper equipment, poor acclimatization and . their alpine-style approach as mistakes for an attempt on the Shark's . Fin. After an epic 22-day climb up a near-vertical Himalayan peak, an Australian couple in their 40s took just two minutes to ""fly"" back to base camp and smash the world record for the highest BASE jump in history.

A paedophile described as 'predatory' who used two children to act out a 'real life pornographic film' has been jailed for 15 years today. Ian Hodkinson groomed the parents of an 11-year-old girl so they trusted him to look after her before raping her with an accomplice, who was just 13. Judge Norman Wright told Liverpool Crown Court that the girl, who had been using the computer in Hodkinson's bedroom, left to go to the toilet before Hodkinson started having sex with the boy so she would see them when she returned. Jailed: Paedophile Ian Hodkinson used two children to act out a 'real life pornographic film' 'She didn't complain or flee as an adult might have done. 'She looked on you as a friend. You had groomed her well,' said Judge Wright. The 41-year-old then sexually assaulted and raped her before ordering the young boy to do the same. Hodkinson, from Wigan, denied the charges along with his co-accused, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, but both were found guilty at a trial at Liverpool Crown Court. Hodkinson was also found guilty of six charges of sexual assault including one on a ten-year-old boy in a separate incident, inciting a child to engage in sexual activity, rape of a child and attempted rape. The judge ordered that he is on extended licence for six years for public protection. Judge Norman Wright, sitting at Liverpool Crown Court (pictured) jailed Hodkinson for 15 years . He banned him from working with children and ordered him to sign the Sex Offenders Register for life. The court heard that he has a previous sexual assault conviction. The juvenile defendant was placed under supervision for two years and was made the subject of a youth rehabilitation order for two sexual assaults and an attempted rape.

A British team has arrived in Antarctica to begin a search for life in a lake that has lain buried under nearly 10,000ft of ice for up to a half a million years. Scientists from the British Antarctic Survey are preparing to bore down to the subglacial Lake Ellsworth, deep beneath the West Antarctic ice sheet, to collect samples of water and sediment. Toiling under the midnight sun, they will endure temperatures well below freezing in a quest to discover whether life can survive in one of the harshest environments on Earth. The Lake Ellsworth drill site on the West Antarctic ice sheet: Four British scientists arrived at the site yesterday to finalise preparations for drilling down to a lake locked beneath nearly 10,000ft of ice . Should they find any organisms living in the icy depths, it could offer tantalising clues as to how life might look if it exists elsewhere in the solar system, such as in the ice-covered oceans of Jupiter's moon Europa. The ambitious search comes after a U.S. team last week announced that they had discovered another lake locked for 3,000 years beneath 65ft of Antarctic glacier was teeming with living organisms. But the Lake Ellsworth mission will drill far deeper, into a far more extreme environment, which scientists believe has been isolated for at least 100,000 years - and probably much longer. Mike Bentley, a geologist on the team . at Durham University, told the Guardian: 'Extreme environments tell you . what constraints there are on life. 'If . we find a particular set of environments where life can't exist, that . creates some bookends: it tells you about the limits of life.' For Queen and country: The mission is the most ambitious attempt yet to use hot water drilling to penetrate deep beneath the glaciers which coat our planets southernmost continent . One of more than 400 subglacial lakes . in Antarctica, Ellsworth is equivalent in size to the UK's Lake . Windermere, measuring 7.5 miles long by 1.8 miles wide, and nearly 500ft . deep. Completely cut off . from any light from the Sun, any life lurking beneath its waters must . endure complete darkness, intense pressure and subzero temperatures. It . is only geothermal heat from the Earth's core and the intense pressure . exerted by the weight of the ice above that has kept it liquid. Four . scientists arrived at the camp above the lake yesterday, where they . joined a team of engineers who have spent the past month preparing the . equipment that will be used to penetrate the icy crust. This week they will finalise the preparations for the three-day drilling hot water drilling operation set to begin December 12. Technology: The BAS team will melt their way into the lake using a 2 mile-long hose tipped with a brass nozzle that sprays sterile water heated to 90C at a pressure of 2,000lbs per square inch . Under pressure: They will first bore down to . 1,000ft, then stop to create a cavity, then drill a second hole all the way down to the lake. The . cavity will stop geysers of pressurised water from erupting on the surface . Lake Ellsworth is one of 200 subglacial lakes in the Antarctic: Equivalent in size to the UK's Lake Windermere, it measures 7.5 miles long by 1.8 miles wide, and is nearly 500ft deep . It has spent the best part of three millennia locked under a 20m block of ice and is six times saltier than sea. And at 13°C below zero, Lake Vida in East Antarctica is one of the coldest aquatic environments on the planet. Yet despite posing some of the most hostile conditions on Earth, the lake is teeming with life. Scientists drilling into the lake have found abundant and diverse bacteria - potentially giving insight into how life might exist on other planets, the journal Nature reported. 'Lake Vida is a model of what happens when you try to freeze a lake solid, and this is the same fate that any lakes on Mars would have gone through as the planet turned colder from a watery past,' said Peter Doran of the University of Illinois, Chicago. 'Any Martian water bodies that did form would have gone through this Vida stage before freezing solid, entombing the evidence of the past ecosystem.' Doran and his colleagues have drilled into Lake Vida twice: once in 2005 and again in 2010. Lake Vida was originally thought to be an ice block lake. However, in 1995, ground penetrating radar surveys revealed a very salty liquid layer underlying a 20m  ice cover. The BAS team will melt their way into the lake using a 2 mile-long hose tipped with a brass nozzle that sprays sterile water heated to 90C at a pressure of 2,000lbs per square inch. They will first bore down to 1,000ft, then stop to create a cavity, then drill a second borehole from the surface down through the this cavity and all the way down to the lake. The cavity is what controls the pressure of the liquid being drawn from Ellsworth, stopping a geyser of prehistoric water from bursting back up through the borehole and spilling out over the surface of the ice. Once they reach the waters, they will have just 24 hours to sterilise the entrance to the hole with intense UV light and lower a probe into the lake to collect their samples before the hold refreezes again. Chris Hill, a British Antarctic Survey engineer who is heading the programme, spoke to the Guardian by phone from his tent on the West Antarctic ice sheet. 'It's bloody cold,' he said. The team will spent six weeks at the site, where temperatures, according to the BAS, are -25C, with winds of 20 knots. For much of that time they will work around the clock. 'Once we've started drilling we can't stop, or the pipes will freeze and that's that,' Mr Hill said. 'We have to go to a 24-hour shift pattern for a week and a half to two weeks, and no matter what the weather does, we have to keep going.'

Several of the horses used on HBO's canceled series 'Luck' were drugged, underweight and sick during production, an animal rights worker who oversaw conditions on the show alleges in a lawsuit. Barbara Casey's suit filed Monday says she was wrongfully fired from her post at the American Humane Association after complaining about the conditions horses faced on the show, which was canceled after a series of high-profile animal deaths. The suit claims four horses died during the show's production, not three as previously reported. Horses were 'often drugged to perform,' and 'underweight and sick horses unsuited for work were routinely used' by producers, her lawsuit alleges. Actor Nick Nolte touches a horse in a scene from 'Luck', which was canceled following the deaths of several animals . Animal rights worker Barbara Casey, who worked on Luck, claims she was wrongfully fired for complaining about the poor conditions horses were subjected to . Casey is suing HBO, which has repeatedly denied abusing horses on the show, and the humane association. The association declined to comment, citing the pending lawsuit. 'We took every precaution to ensure that our horses were treated humanely and with the utmost care, exceeding every safeguard of all protocols and guidelines required of the production,' HBO wrote in a statement. Casey's suit states she urged the humane association to report HBO and producers to authorities for possible animal-cruelty criminal charges. The association 'bowed to political and financial pressure and refused to report the production defendants' conduct to the authorities,' the lawsuit states. Casey served as director of the association's Film and Television Unit, which oversees animal welfare and often allows a notice to be attached to the end of films and television shows that says no animals were harmed during production. The nonprofit association's film- and TV-monitoring efforts are paid for through entertainment industry grants, according to the lawsuit. The HBO series featured (from left) Joan Allen, Dustin Hoffman, John Ortiz and Dennis Farina . HBO canceled 'Luck,' starring Dustin Hoffman, in March 2012 after three horse deaths were reported during production. Casey claims a fourth horse, named Hometrader, was killed in summer 2011 but its demise wasn't documented because it occurred during a hiatus in filming. The final horse that died during the series' production had been examined by a California Horse Racing Board veterinarian shortly before it suffered a head injury while being led by a groomer to a stable. By that point, the humane association and the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals had both been critical of the show's safety record and praised its cancellation. Casey's lawsuit seeks unspecified damages.

The Caltech team confirmed the . remaining three, then analysed the five-planet system and compared it to . other systems found by the Kepler mission. The planets orbit an M dwarf star — also known as red dwarfs, this type accounts for about three-quarters of all stars in the Milky Way. The five planets, which are similar in size to Earth and orbit close to their star, are also typical of the class of planets that the telescope has discovered orbiting other M dwarfs, Swift says. Therefore, the researchers concluded, the majority of planets in the galaxy probably have characteristics comparable to those of the five planets. Habitable zones: These are the regions of space around a star where conditions are favourable for life as found on Earth. This Nasa graphic shows how the region is closer or further depending on the type of star . The region of the Milky Way where Kepler points: Each rectangle indicates the specific region of the sky covered by each CCD in Kepler's photometer. There are a total of 42 CCD elements in pairs, each comprising a square . Other teams of astronomers have . already estimated that there is roughly one planet per star, but this is . the first time researchers have made such an estimate by studying . M-dwarf systems. But their . analysis only considers planets that are in close orbits around M dwarfs . — not the outer planets of an M-dwarf system, or those orbiting other . kinds of stars. While Kepler 32 may not be unique, what sets it apart is its coincidental orientation: the orbits of the planets lie in a plane that's positioned such that the Kepler space telescope views the system edge-on. Thanks to this rare orientation, each planet blocks Kepler-32's starlight as it passes between the star and the Kepler telescope. By analysing changes in the star's brightness, the astronomers were able to determine the planets' characteristics, such as their sizes and orbital periods. This orientation offered an opportunity to study the system in great detail, and because the planets represent the vast majority of planets that are thought to populate the galaxy, the system also can help astronomers better understand planet formation in general. 'I usually try not to call things ""Rosetta stones"", but this is as close to a Rosetta stone as anything I've seen,' said Professor Johnson. 'It's like unlocking a language that we're trying to understand—the language of planet formation.' As a . result, they say, their estimate is conservative. In fact, says Mr . Swift, a more accurate estimate that includes data from other analyses . could lead to an average of two planets per star. M-dwarf systems like Kepler-32's are quite different from our own solar system. For one, M dwarfs are cooler and much smaller than the sun. Kepler-32, for example, has half the mass of the sun and half its radius. The radii of its five planets range from 0.8 to 2.7 times that of Earth, and those planets orbit extremely close to their star. The whole system fits within just over a tenth of an astronomical unit (the average distance between Earth and the sun) — a distance that is about a third of the radius of Mercury's orbit around the sun. The fact that M-dwarf systems vastly outnumber other kinds of systems carries a profound implication, according to Professor Johnson, which is that our solar system is something of a cosmic 'weirdo'. But although the planets in M-dwarf systems orbit close to their stars, it does not necessarily mean that they're fiery, hellish worlds unsuitable for life, the astronomers say. Indeed, because M dwarfs are small and cool, their temperate zone — also known as the 'habitable zone,' the region where liquid water might exist — is also further inward. Even though only the outermost of Kepler-32's five planets lies in its temperate zone, many other M dwarf systems have more planets that sit right in their temperate zones. The implications of a galaxy chock full of planets are far-reaching, the researchers say. 'It's really fundamental from an origins standpoint,' said Mr Swift, who noted that because M dwarfs shine mainly in infrared light, the stars are invisible to the naked eye. 'Kepler has enabled us to look up at the sky and know that there are more planets out there than stars we can see.'","Analysis only includes planets in close orbits around certain kinds of stars - meaning that estimate could yet be DOUBLED .

If you are looking for a way to raise more money for charity, science has a simple answer: go blonde. Donors to charities give nearly a quarter more if they are approached by a blonde fundraiser than a brunette, a study claims. But be careful which families you pick. The same research shows that blondes receive significantly lower donations at non-Caucasian households. Money spinner: Blonde hair can increase the amount of donations a woman raising money for charity can solicit by as much as 23 per cent, a study claims . Researchers from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville conducted a study to investigate the effect of hair colour on the generosity of those solicited for charitable donations. 'This study examines how a cosmetic attribute - hair colour - impacts productivity in a door-to-door fund-raising experiment,' wrote Michael Price, assistant professor of economics, in the study published in Economics Letters. Taking into account previous studies which showed how attractiveness affected earnings, Professor Price investigated whether similar returns are correlated with hair colour. He found that blonde women gained much more from their perceived good looks, but that this was only the case when they visited Caucasian households - with non-Caucasian households apparently unaffected by good looking blondes. 'The returns to physical appearance are approximately 71.6 to 76.0 per cent greater for a blonde female than a brunette (minority) counterpart,' Professor Price wrote. 'Interestingly, the returns to beauty for blonde females are driven entirely by Caucasian households. In fact, blondes receive significantly lower donations at non-Caucasian households. 'Yet there is no discernible difference across household types for both brunette and minority females.' Unaffected: The study also showed that the extra . fundraising effect of blonde hair was lost when blonde volunteers . visited non-Caucasians - but that brunettes and ethnic minority . volunteers still received as much . Women charged with murder who plead self defence are more likely to be perceived as guilty if have 'thick lips' and 'smooth and harmonious facial features', says a study. The findings made by a team from the University of Grenada, Spain, contradict the generally held stereotype that beauty deflects criminal responsibility. They found that in the case of a woman claiming self defence in the killing of an abusive husband, police officers were more likely to regard as innocent defendants who were described as unattractive. The findings also showed that women perceived as more independent and in charge of their lives were also more likely to be seen as guilty of murder. Legal processes are ideally conducted without bias, but in reality biases influence all human judgements and looking at how these prejudices shape behaviour should help to minimise their effect. In the past, social psychologists had widely accepted the contention that beautiful people are less likely to be regarded as criminally responsible. The study looked at the amounts of money people living in Pitt County, North Carolina, were willing to contribute to the Center for Natural Hazards Mitigation Research at East Carolina University. Professor Price enlisted 44 volunteers to visit 1,755 potential donor households, 522 of which actually contributed money to the cause. However, for the purposes of the study, the research was restricted to 955 households who were approached by 23 female volunteers. Professor Price and his team took digital photos of each of these female volunteers, divided them into blondes, brunettes and minorities, and asked undergraduate students to rate their attractiveness. They found that households were around 13 per cent more likely to contribute when approached by an attractive female. However, keeping beauty a constant, findings showed that households were 23 per cent more likely to make a donation when visited by a blonde femail than a brunette who was judged just as attractive. However, when blondes visited minority households, findings showed the effects of their attractiveness was muted, with the effect of increasing the beauty of the blonde visitor 509.7 per cent lower than that of a brunette. 'Empirical results suggest that returns to physical appearance are, on average, greater for blonde females but depend critically on characteristics of the potential donor,' Professor Price concluded.","Blondes found to raise 23 per cent more than equally attractive brunettes .

They're hoping to prove the perfect partnership for the judges when Dancing On Ice starts next week. However, when it comes to off the ice, it appears that Samia Ghadie and Sylvain Longchambon's real-life partnerships aren't going quite so well. Coronation Street star Samia split from former co-star Will Thorp earlier this month following a two year romance, while Sylvain is also said to have ended his relationship with actress Jennifer Metcalfe. Growing close: Samia Ghadie and Sylvain Longchambon leave a London hotel together on December 12 after filming for the new series . Although Samia is getting all well with Sylvain, she is stunned by reports suggesting they are anything more than skating partners. A source close to Samia told the MailOnline: 'She isn't dating Sylvain and they haven't seen each other for three weeks. There has been no date, there is nothing going on between them.' However, a source close to the French professional ice skater revealed that Sylvain had been open with his current girlfriend, actress Jennifer, that he was developing feelings for his new co-star. The Hollyoaks beauty was said to have thought it just a phase, so was devastated when he called her on Friday night from France - where he had flown to for Christmas - to tell her that their two-year relationship was over. Working relationship: The pair hung out with their Dancing On Ice colleagues at a London hotel earlier this month . The source told the Sunday Mirror: 'When Sylvain first admitted that he had real feelings for Samia, she was gutted. 'It's been a difficult time but she thought it would pass.

Over-running engineering work, signal failures and packed trains have been heaping misery on rail passengers today as they returned to work after the Christmas break. A train at Crewe, Cheshire, was so full some passengers were ordered off before it could continue. At some other stations trains were so packed that passengers could not board, with some lucky enough to have got on earlier forced to sit in the aisles. Misery: Passengers were left looking at information boards in hope at London Paddington today . The late-running engineering work meant that the Heathrow Express was not able to run until late morning, and when it did start there were delays to the service. The Heathrow Express issue was due to a power supply problem at Maidenhead in Berkshire which meant delays to the finish of engineering work and no services - to start with - between Paddington station in London and Reading in Berkshire. There were a number of other problems as well. A late finish to platform work at Balham in south east London also caused delays to London-bound commuters this morning. In the Midlands, a freight train derailment at Barrow-upon-Soar meant trains were unable to call at that station, with buses replacing trains between Loughborough and Barrow-upon-Soar. The derailment also led to delays to services between East Midlands Parkway, Leicester and Peterborough. In Scotland a broken-down train at Neilston meant no trains were able to run between Neilston and Glasgow Central, while Arriva Trains Wales reported delays between Neath and Swansea due to signalling problems. London Midland services in the Birmingham area were also delayed today, with the company saying there were limited platforms available at Birmingham New Street after engineering work. Later, a signalling problem near Milton Keynes Central in Buckinghamshire led to delays to London Midland and Virgin Trains' services between London and Milton Keynes. London Midland passengers also had to put up with a broken-down train at Coventry which led to a suspension of services between Coventry and Nuneaton. There were also delays to services between Hereford and Worcester due to late-running engineering work. Welcome back: Overcrowded greeted commuters returning to work today (library image) More late-running engineering work at Haymarket in Edinburgh led to delays of up to 40 minutes. Elsewhere in Scotland, buses replaced trains between Aberdeen and Inverurie after someone was hit by a train. Planned engineering work that was due to carry on was affecting services on a number of routes, while the effects of the flooding were still being felt in some areas - particularly the West Country. FGW advised passengers not to travel to and from Devon and Cornwall. Routes still closed included Liskeard to Looe in Cornwall and Exeter St Davids to Barnstaple in Devon. The line between Exeter St Davids and Tiverton Parkway was also shut and there was only a very limited service running between Newton Abbot and Exeter St Davids. In early afternoon, the Southeastern train company said that due to the over-running of engineering work in the Medway area of Kent that had been expected to finish at 4am tomorrow, it would be running a similar amended timetable tomorrow, as it had today. Hold-up: The entrance to the platforms at Paddington was unusually quite because of the delays . NR said there had been problems with bridge work being carried out at Rochester. Before the floods and the late-running engineering work, NR said about half the number of bus replacement services would be needed this year compared with the 2011/12 festive season. In recent years, NR's festive season engineering work, and other bank holiday projects, have generally finished on time. However, there was severe disruption when work was not completed in time for the big return to work in January 2008. This led to NR being fined a record £14 million by the Office of Rail Regulation. The most damaging overrun in the 2007/08 festive season was on the West Coast main line - a route where major work is being carried out during this festive period.","One train was so full passengers were ordered off before it could continue .

The Armed Forces' ability to defend the country has diminished to a 'perilous degree' because of spending cuts, former defence chiefs have warned. They argue in a damning report from the UK National Defence Association (UKDA) that investment is needed to plug gaps in the Royal Navy, Army and Royal Air Force created by the funding squeeze. The UKNDA's chief executive, Commander John Muxworthy, branded the Armed Forces a 'sacrificial lamb' and 'Cinderella of the public services', and said the nation's security is being 'severely compromised'. Diminished: Defence chiefs called for the investment in Armed Forces to plug gaps created by funding cuts . The State Of The Nation's Armed Forces report presents the views of all three services, having been co-authored by Admiral Lord West, General Sir Michael Rose and Air Chief Marshal Sir Michael Graydon. Writing on the Royal Navy, Admiral Lord West, First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff from 2002 to 2006, said: 'The ability of our military to protect the nation from the shock of the unexpected has diminished to a perilous degree.' He added that the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review was the 'final nail in the coffin' and said the Navy was 'far from being as robust as the nation has a right to expect'. Admiral West also called an increase in defence funding to the equivalent of 3% of GDP, which he said was 'vital to the survival and wealth of our nation and people'. Perilous: Admiral Lord West called for defence funding to increase to the equivalent of 3% of GDP . Writing on the prospects for the Army, General Sir Michael Rose, who commanded UN forces in Bosnia, said the latest reductions in manpower and an over-reliance on the Territorial Army 'could prove fatal'. The military is set to increase its reliance on reserves as the regular Army is slashed by 20,000, accompanying it by a doubling in the number of so-called weekend warriors to 30,000. He said: 'Given the past run-down of the TA including the closure of TA centres, the reduction in man training days and lack of funding for recruitment campaigns, it is clearly not possible to increase the trained manpower of the Reserves in time to compensate for regular soldiers being made redundant.' Former head of the RAF Air Chief Marshal Sir Michael Graydon added his concerns for the future of the Air Force. Whole capabilities are absent, such as maritime patrol and long range electronic reconnaissance, while the loss of the Harrier GR9 fleet has left the nation with no sea-borne offensive air support, as well as a serious reduction in numbers of close air support aircraft vital in operations such as Libya or Afghanistan, he said. He added: 'It is the matter of numbers which is the greatest challenge in the years ahead. 'Mass matters, and all the Armed Forces, the Royal Navy and RAF in particular, will have to find a better balance between the demands of high tech warfare and the simple fact that quantity has a quality of its own; it will require an honest recognition that without the United States we are severely restricted in what we can actually achieve.' In his introduction to the report, Commmander Muxworthy said: 'Over the past two decades, defence has been the Cinderella of the public services. Manpower: General Sir Michael Rose warned that over-reliance on the TA 'could prove fatal' 'Whilst the share of public expenditure devoted to health and welfare has skyrocketed, the proportion granted to defence has shrunk. 'Defence has for far too long been a sacrificial lamb. The security of the United Kingdom is being severely compromised by the continued swingeing cuts to our Armed Forces. 'Since its formation in 2007 the UK National Defence Association has led the way in endeavouring to advise the people and politicians of this country of the risks and weaknesses that have been forced upon our Armed Forces. 'These have been very clearly highlighted in the reports written by three very experienced and knowledgeable retired senior officers: for the Royal Navy, Admiral The Lord West of Spithead; for the Army, General Sir Michael Rose; and for the Royal Air Force, Air Chief Marshal Sir Michael Graydon.

A heavy metal guitarist has died after collapsing on stage at a gig to celebrate his band mate's 50th birthday. Mike Scaccia, 47, was playing with Rigor Mortis at the Rail Club in Fort Worth, Texas, on Saturday night when he stunned the crowd by collapsing. The musician - who also plays with another heavy metal group Ministry - was celebrating lead singer Bruce Corbitt's birthday when he suffered the heart attack caused by heart disease. Metal head: Mike Scaccia, centre, with Ministry band maters Tommy Victor, right, and Al Jourgensen . Earlier reports suggested Scaccia died from a seizure after asking for strobe lights in the club to be turned off during his performance. A statement posted by Corbitt on his Facebook page said: 'My brother is gone! The only reason I am who I am is because of this man. 'If it wasn't for him I wouldn't even be in a band. RIP Mike Scaccia! The greatest guitar player I ever knew!' Scaccia was born in 1965 in Babylon, New York, and formed Rigor Mortis in 1983. The Texas-based group, who are credited as pioneers of thrash metal, added Corbitt five years later and released their self-titled debut album, having landed a major record deal with Capitol.

A mother and son have had their electronic tags removed so they can celebrate Christmas and New Year's Eve despite being convicted of a festive burglary. A mother and son convicted of burgling a house during the festive period have been told they can remove their curfew tags so they can celebrate Christmas and New Year's Eve. Magistrates sparked outrage by telling Julie Crowe, 40, and son Jack, 18, just days before Christmas Day that they were free to enjoy the festive season with their family in Gillingham, Kent. The pair successfully applied for the resections to be lifted until January 2, angering law-abiding members of the public. Curfew: Magistrates told a mother and son they could remove their tags so they can celebrate the festivities . The mother and son were sentenced in September for stealing £250 worth of duvets, ornaments and vases from a show home in Kempston, Bedfordshire, three days after Christmas last year. Julie Crowe was also guilty of making fake charity buckets and given a community order and four month curfew restricting her to her Kempston home between 7pm and 7am daily. Jack Crowe is serving six month on a tag. A reader of a local newspaper's website Bedfordshire-news.co.uk said: 'A bad call by the magistrates. Maybe if the lovely Miss Crowe and her wonderful son missed the family knees-up in Gillingham, they would think a bit harder about ripping off charitable folk and stealing property?' Chair of the bench at  at Bedford Magistrates Court, Sandra Reynolds, said: 'Because of your good compliance with your sentence we are going to grant this application. We are not extending the curfew length so you both get a lot of time off.' Removed: The mother and son were told their curfew would be lifted at Bedford Magistrates' Court . The court heard Julie Crowe was prepared to have the days off added to her sentence, but her son could not because he is serving the maximum sentence on tag. Jane Anderson, defending, said: 'Miss Crowe doesn't want it to appear she's getting away from her punishment by visiting her family and she has offered for her curfew to be extended.' Electronic tags are attached to criminals who are spared jail or released from prison earlier. They fit onto their legs and allow the authorities to monitor their whereabouts through GPS technology - with their location usually sent to a control room through a mobile phone network. Last year blundering staff at private security firm G4S attached a tag to the false leg of Christopher Lowcock, from Rochdale. The 29-year-old was given the curfew for driving, drug and weapons offences but was able to dodge the restriction by detaching his prosthetic limb. Tagged: Labour MP Eric Joyce admitted cutting off his electronic tag to compete in a boat race . In 2008, heroin dealer Aaron Morgan, 22, from Devon, was let off the last two months of his curfew when Judge Graham Cottle ruled the tag 'did not look fashionable with shorts', and earlier this year Beverley Douglas was spared a tag because it did not fit around her chubby ankles. Tags also failed to stop Rikki Johnson breaking his curfew and stabbing 18-year-old Lewis Singleton to death in 2008 or disgraced property tycoon Shaid Luqman, 42, fleeing the country in 2010. Earlier this year MP Eric Joyce, who was given a curfew following a Westminster punch-up, admitted cutting his tag off to compete in the annual boat race between the House of Common and the House of Lords. Figures show tagging costs the country £100 million a year, with 64,420 people tagged in 2010-11. But more than 1,000 violent crimes have been committed by offenders released from jail early with a tag, while 2,000 a year are ripping off their tags.","Magistrates tell pair they are free to enjoy festivities with their family .

The waterfront house that became the symbol of the destruction caused by Hurricane Sandy has been torn down. Princess Cottage in New Jersey had been ripped in half by the devastating winds that battered the east coast of the United States in October. A bulldozers finished the job on Friday, tearing down the 150-year Front Street house in the seaside town of Union Beach. Still standing: The image of the house in Union Beach ripped in half by the winds became a symbol of Sandy . Razed: The home was demolished because its owners could not raise enough money to salvage the house . Demolition took just 15 minutes and was witnessed by John Zois, who had lived at the house for six months prior to Sandy. Engineers had told him the house could be saved but he was unable to raise the money needed for its restoration, despite a public appeal. He told Howell Patch: 'It's stood as a symbol, I think in a small way. It certainly helped to get a lot of attention to the town, a lot of aid to the town, which is good. 'And it's a symbol, I think, of a resilience to the hurricane. Obviously it's coming down today but this house stood, only maybe half of it but it's still there and we're still here. Coming down: It took a single bulldozer just 15 minutes to raze the house to the ground . New start: The owners of Princess Cottage plan to rebuild a house on the waterfront site . 'That's all I can say really. It's time for it to come down, move forward, rebuild and start a new chapter.' He added: 'I don't want this. I would rather if I was going to be on TV and part of history, I would have refered it to be for something good but, it's a part of like it or not and we have to make the most of it.' Mr Zois' father Constantine, who . owned the house, told Asbury Park Press the family plan to build another . house on the site but said it will not be an exact replica of Princess . Cottage. He said he knew the house would have to come down, and added: 'I was hoping against hope that I was dead wrong.' Calm before the storm: Princess Cottage in Front Street, Union Beach, before Sandy . Resilience: The house remained standing despite half of the building being blown down by Sandy . Eye-catching: The striking image of the damaged home helped bring much-needed aid into the area . John Zois continued: 'To see my home away from . home, which became my home, destroyed like this - it's hard to take, . it's just hard to take.' The three-storey building remained standing despite the damage for two months after the storm, with its roof incredibly in tact. But Princess Cottage is one of around 50 properties in the area whose owners have agreed to raze to the ground. Hurricane Sandy caused widespread destruction across the eastern United States and parts of the Caribbean - killing more than 250 people and causing 65.6 billion dollars worth of damage.

"Advertising portrayals branded 'depressing, manipulative and hopeless' By . Alex Gore . PUBLISHED: . 06:59 EST, 27 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:21 EST, 27 December 2012 . Band Aid stereotypes of Africa are no longer moving the British public and leaving people on the continent starving, Oxfam has warned. The aid agency said the public must shake-off the portrayals of Africa promoted by the celebrity-driven campaigns of the 1980s and 2004. Oxfam stressed the majority of people have become desensitised to images depicting issues such as hunger, drought and disease. Hunger: The public has become desensitised to images such as this of famine and drought in Ethiopia . Over-exposure to negative media and . advertising portrayals of Africa and developing countries in other parts . of the world was described as 'depressing, manipulative and hopeless' by respondents to a YouGov survey of more than 2,000 people. Nearly 50 per cent of those polled said it made them feel that conditions for people living in the developing world would never improve. When asked to select what they thought . were the three most pressing problems facing Africa over the next year, . almost half identified hunger. And although 74 per cent thought it . was ultimately possible to bring an end to hunger in Africa, only one . in five believe they could play an active role in this. 'Give us your money': Band Aid stars (left to right) George Michael, Bob Geldof, Sting and Simon LeBon . In response, Oxfam is launching a new campaign to try to refocus public support for the cause. Through . the Food for All campaign, the charity aims to show the continent's . potential instead of just its problems by striking a more optimistic . tone. It comes 18 years after Bob Geldof and Midge Ure formed super group Band Aid and released Do They Know It's Christmas? to help tackle famine in Ethiopia. The campaign was revived in 1989 and again in 2004. Oxfam chief executive, Barbara Stocking, said: 'Oxfam has led the way in drawing attention to the plight of Africa's most vulnerable people and we aren't trying to gloss over the problems that still beset so many of them, particularly levels of malnutrition that remain stubbornly high. Malnourished: Refugees wait for their daily ration of corn porridge at a refugee camp in Angola . 'But we've come a long way since the 1980s and Band Aid's Do They Know it's Christmas? We need to shrug off the old stereotypes and celebrate the continent's diversity and complexity, which is what we are attempting with this campaign. 'The relentless focus on ongoing problems at the expense of a more nuanced portrait of the continent, is obscuring the progress that is being made towards a more secure and prosperous future. 'If we want people to help fight hunger we have to give them grounds for hope by showing the potential of countries across Africa; it's a natural instinct to turn away from suffering when you feel you can do nothing to alleviate it.' In another recent Oxfam poll, when asked to name the first thing that springs to mind when thinking of Africa, more than half of 1,295 respondents spontaneously mentioned issues relating to hunger, famine or poverty.

A housing estate where three out of four people are on benefits and four out of five children grow up in poverty has been named the most deprived area in England for a fifth consecutive year. The latest figures also show 72 per cent of people living on the Falinge estate in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, are unemployed. The town's Labour MP, Simon Danczuk, says not enough is being done to improve the area and has called for prompt action to halt its decline. Unacceptable: MP Simon Danczuk said Rochdale had to 'face facts' and tackle the 'real issue' Decline: Four out of five children on the estate are growing up in poverty, according to Government data . Concrete vista: Flats in the centre of the Falinge, where one in 10 girls fall pregnant under the age of 18 . The Department for Communities and Local Government published the table after combining income and employment data to create an overall deprivation rank. 1. Falinge (Rochdale) 2.

North Huyton (Knowsley) 10. Hupurhey (Manchester) Harpurhey, also in Greater Manchester, which is home to nine of the 50 most deprived areas, had topped the rankings since the figures were first published in 2002. An area in Langworthy, Salford, was ranked second-most deprived and Harpurhey was in the top 10. The least deprived area was the village of Little Eriswell in Suffolk, followed by neighbouring RAF base Lakenheath. The statistics show Falinge has 71 per cent of people living in low-income households and 72 per cent claiming out-of-work benefits. It is home to around 1,500 people - 80 per cent of who are white British. More than 200 children on the estate are growing up in poverty, with around 800 people claiming council tax or housing benefits. People living in Falinge are not expected to live beyond the age of 69 - while those living just two miles away in Norden and Banford can expected to live for 10 years longer. The council's own statistics show Falinge also has one of the highest teenage pregnancy rates in the country, with one in 10 girls giving birth under the age of 18. Home sweet home: Jay Wilson (right), outside his £60 a week Falinge flat, said he prays he gets a move . A way out: Mr Wilson is fed up of living in the ground floor flat he claims is riddled with damp . Community spirit: People living in Falinge are not expected to live beyond the age of 69 . Up to date crime statistics show . there were nearly 70 violent crimes in the north Rochdale area in a . single month at the end of last year, with more than 200 incidents of . anti-social behaviour and nearly 60 burglaries. Seven per cent of people living there have never worked, 82 per cent claim benefits and 59 per cent have no employable skills. Mr . Danczuk said residents were paying the price for opportunities missed . by the Rochdale Development Agency, which works with the local authority . to attract investment in the area. He . said: 'It's not acceptable that the area continues to top these . government deprivation tables. Not enough is being done and we need to . act now to turn it around.

'There has been a failure by the local . authorities to regenerate and it's frustrating to see brownfield sites . that just aren't being developed. 'To improve the area we need to help build the confidence of the people who live there and provide them with opportunities.' The figures are taken from analysis of . data collected in 2009, and Rochdale council leader, Colin Lambert, . argued that they do not reflect the current situation.

City centre (Cambridge) He said: 'For example, the latest figures for the ward the Falinge estate is in shows the percentage of working-age residents claiming Job Seekers Allowance has fallen over the last 12 months - for young job seekers by 13.1 per cent.' Cllr Lambert added the council was working to give Falinge residents more job opportunities, with two active work clubs in the area and new jobs being attracted to the borough. In 2010, a Falinge resident Gillian Duffy grabbed headlines when the then Prime Minister, Gordon Brown was recorded calling her a bigot on a visit to Rochdale. Last year Rochdale was rocked by an investigation into a sex trafficking gang, which preyed on vulnerable young girls. It led to nine men being jailed in May for grooming girls as young as 13 for sexual exploitation. The deprivation figures have been . published amid concerns that rising levels of poverty and scarce job . prospects for young people could lead to fresh unrest on Britain's . streets. 'There has been a failure by the local authorities to regenerate and it's frustrating' Deprivation: Falinge in Rochdale has been named most deprived area of England for the fifth year running .

Against the odds: Hamima Juma with her daughters, who were born on Christmas Day exactly three year apart . The perfectly timed Christmas presents both came later than expected for Hamima and her husband Maruf - having originally shared the same due date of December 19. Maheera, was born at 9.05am and weighed 5lbs 12oz, while the couple's latest arrival, who they have not yet named, weighed 5lbs 11oz and was born at 10.30pm. The proud mother, who gave birth to both girls at Coventry's University Hospital, said yesterday: 'I used to joke with my friends that this baby would come early on Christmas Day again. 'But that was only supposed to be a joke. It shows that nobody knows what is going to happen. 'Once I went into labour my husband was willing the birth to be before 12 o'clock.

Bookmaker James Desmond said the odds of the two births both coming on Christmas Day were 'phenomenal'. He said: 'It is a long shot to have a baby on Christmas day, a one in 365 chance, but to have two born on Christmas day years apart puts the odds up to a phenomenal level.

Michael Chopra has banned himself from betting shops in Ipswich in a bid to sort out his gambling addiction. The Ipswich striker admitted today he is in such bad debt he cannot afford to pay the minimum £50,000 legal fees required to get someone to represent him in a trial. He has been charged by the British Horseracing Authority for breaching their rules. If the BHA win their case against him they can only ban him from racecourses and their gambling establishments. Tumbling: Chopra's gambling addiction has caused serious problems . But Chopra said in a statement: ‘It is well publicised that I have a gambling addiction problem and I see any such sanctions as being a useful mechanism in helping me to address these problems. As of this year, I’ve voluntarily self-excluded myself from all betting institutions from where I live in Ipswich in order to help me fight this illness.’ Chopra and eight others were charged by the BHA in October for breaching their Rules of Racing and the two-week trial begins on January 14. He is accused of placing bets for horses to lose in a five-month period between November 2010 and March 2011 using information passed on either directly or indirectly by jockey Andrew Heffernan, who is also standing trial. Chopra was advised that even if he was found innocent he would not be refunded his legal fees for being represented in the inquiry. Heavy debt: Chopra cannot afford to pay his legal fees . The 29-year-old added: ‘I have extensive debts and loans and simply cannot afford the amount of money necessary to clear my name, with no prospects of ever recovering my costs. I am not a member of the British Horseracing Authority and not subject to its rules. I have been advised that the British Horseracing Authority is only allowed under its rules to take disciplinary action against a person who is subject to those rules, which does not include me.’ BHA responded later on Wednesday, when media manager Robin Mounsey said: 'The charges being brought by the BHA against Michael Chopra are serious and relate to conspiring with other persons to commit a corrupt or fraudulent practice, and offering bribes to a licensed person. 'It is the BHA's role to protect the integrity of the sport from corrupt practices from both licensed and unlicensed individuals. On trial: James Coppinger (left) and Mark Wilson (second right) are also involved . 'As such, via a disciplinary panel, the BHA is able to impose sanctions upon individuals not bound by the Rules of racing, which include exclusion from entering any licensed premises or having dealings with any licensed person regarding horseracing. 'The BHA will not comment further on this investigation until the hearing has been completed and the disciplinary panel has published its findings.'

A seagull calmly bobs on the surface of the sea unaware it is just inches away from the jaws of death. This remarkable photograph of a beady-eyed great white shark homing in on its unsuspecting prey echoes the iconic poster for Steven Spielberg's 1975 blockbuster Jaws. But incredibly, despite the ocean beast looking set to devour the seagull in seconds, the shark gave the bird nothing more than a fright. Jaws of death: Great white shark swims within inches of an unsuspecting seagull on the surface . The picture was taken by marine photographer Erin Quigley on a diving expedition in Isla Guadalupe, Mexico. Ms Quigley, who took a series photographs from within a shark cage while the animals lurked around her, said: 'I was 16 when Jaws was released, and my siblings and I were obsessed. 'My sister had the poster from the film, showing a hapless swimmer about to be devoured, on her wall, and it was so terrifying that I used to avert my eyes as I passed it on my way to bed at night. 'But this time I was hoping to capture a similar drama on camera. A group of seagulls had landed on the water, attracted by bait we were using to lure the sharks. 'From above the water, the gulls didn't seem afraid or even very concerned about the sharks, just peeved when one took a swipe at them. 'In fact, it was surprising how half-heartedly the sharks pursued the gulls, and how little energy the gulls had to use to get away. But once we got underwater, it revealed an entirely different story. Iconic: The photograph echoes the famous poster for Steven Spielberg's 1975 blockbuster Jaws . 'Even the slowest approach of the enormous shark towards the tiny, vulnerable feet of the gull created an encounter full of life-and-death suspense.' Ms Quigley's trip took place after a hurricane and the sea was rougher than usual at the diving site. The photographer had never even been in a shark cage before and was said she was surprised how hard it was to manage the camera while rattling around in side it. She added: 'I just got lucky with this photo. This young shark had been toying with the gulls all day, bumping their feet with his nose and then swimming off. 'He finally picked on one that was close enough for me to get a decent shot of. '","Remarkable photograph echoes iconic poster for 1975 blockbuster Jaws .

Brothers in arms: Olympic cyclist Bradley Wiggins is set to make a cameo appearance on a new single with his hero Paul Weller . Olympic cycling hero Sir Bradley Wiggins is to reunite his heroes The Jam for a one-off recording 30 years after the band split. The gold medal and Tour de France winner, 32, is set to bring together frontman Paul Weller and bassist Bruce Foxton to re-record a version of the song Window Shopping, according to the Daily Mirror. Guitarist Steve Cropper and Russell Hastings - lead singer of From The Jam - will also join the group for the session next month. A source told the Daily Mirror: 'It’s all incredibly exciting and has been in the pipeline for some time. 'Everything has finally been signed off though, and a date set for mid-February.' Paul Weller, 54, has reportedly organised the recording in his Surrey studio and the five of them will also record a video for the track. Sir Bradley Wiggins, who was knighted in the New Year's honours list, is known for his love of rock music,especially the Modfather's band The Jam. The source added: 'Bradley is due on a training camp abroad on the afternoon of the session, so he is doing his bit first thing. 'He will be joining his boyhood heroes, Bruce and Steve, on guitar with a small cameo, and as well as lending his studio, Paul will chip in on instrumentals, while Russell will be on vocals. 'Bruce and Paul are getting on really well and although there are certainly no immediate plans for a Jam reunion, stranger things have happened.' Bradley Wiggins showed off his guitar skills at an after-party following his triumph in the BBC 's Sports Personality of the Year show . Reunited: Paul Weller, left, and former Jam bassist Bruce Foxton, right, started speaking again two years ago after both lost loved ones around the same time . The original version of Window Shopping was released in October on Foxton’s album, Back In The Room, which Weller played a number of instruments on, including the glockenspiel. Sir Bradley was introduced to his idol last year and the pair are said to have stayed in touch. After a triumphant year winning a gold medal at the Olympics and the Tour de France, his crowning glory saw him take the Sports Personality of the Year gong in December. And he delighted fans by playing guitar in an impromptu performance of The Jam classic, That’s Entertainment at an after-party.

For Ally Vagg and her boyfriend Bryan Williams, their trip to the Amazon basin was meant to be the holiday of a lifetime. And it has been just that - but for all the wrong reasons. The couple, from Australia, are now stranded in Bolivia and are not allowed to return home after contracting a rare flesh-eating parasite. Ally Vagg and her boyfriend Bryan Williams are stranded in Bolivia, unable to return home due to contracting a rare flesh-eating parasite . After suffering from irritated skin, they initially thought they were simply suffering from mosquito bites - a standard occurrence in that part of the world. But then, to their horror, both Ally and Bryan started to feel something squirming under their skin . and occasionally poking its head out of some of the open wounds. It was then they were diagnosed with the human bot fly . infection, according to The Gold Cost Bulletin. While their wounds probably did start as mosquito bites, the theory is the insects were carrying bot fly eggs. These dropped into the wounds caused by the mosquito bites before the larvae then hatched under the skin. Fly larvae had been living under their skin, feeding on their flesh. The maggots eventually crawl out of the host body and become large densely haired bot flies that resemble bees . The couple, who live in Sydney, are now stranded in Bolivia until they are free of the parasites. It's thought that up to 50 eggs could be living in each wound. Fly larvae had been living under their skin, feeding on their flesh. The . maggots eventually crawl out of the host body and become large densely . haired bot flies that resemble bumblebees. 'I lifted my shirt to see the head of it crawling at the top of my skin . looking like a worm or fishing bait,'' Mr Williams told the newspaper. The newspaper reports that they have already pulled seven of the worm-like larvae from wounds on their stomach, back and legs. Mr Williams is also said to have spent days with tape over his stomach wound, a method used to starve the larvae of air and draw them to the surface. During another attempt to remove the parasites his friend pulled out three of the inch-long larvae. He said: 'We all nearly puked. Repeatedly.' The pair may also need minor surgery to remove the remaining parasites. The couple hope to return to Australia in mid to late February but must remain in Bolivia until at least next month when they expect to be fully healed. Ordeal: The couple must remain in Bolivia until at least next month when they expect to be fully healed . A female bot fly captures a mosquito and attaches its eggs to its body before releasing it. The mosquito then carries the eggs and when it bites an animal's skin, will drop the eggs and they burrow under the skin's surface. They stay just below the surface to breathe, and the most common . treatment is to cut off their air supply with vaseline - so they will . crawl out. Untreated, they can burrow too far down and need to be cut out before they develop into flies. Contracting the condition is highly unlikely, and the only reported . cases are from tropical areas, mainly Africa and South America. Dr Ron Behrens of the London Hospital of Tropical Diseases said: 'It can occur in anyone. A mosquito drops the bot fly's eggs . onto the skin. The bot fly doesn't come into contact with the person, . the mosquito does it, as a third party. 'The pupae then burrow under the skin - often the scalp, legs or groin . area - and feed off it, but stay close to the surface so they can . breathe. 'Flies can also lay their eggs on clothing hanging out to dry, so we . recommend ironing it beforehand, if you're staying in a tropical area. 'They would have been growing bigger under this man's skin, which makes . it very painful. After a couple of weeks they develop into flies, and . are moving around - which is very unpleasant. But luckily it can be . successfully treated.'","Ally Vagg and boyfriend Bryan Williams got mosquito bites on Amazon trip .

Unleashing the free market: Influential lobbyist Robert Walker has suggested that future Nasa missions could be sponsored by private companies . The next rover built to explore the surface of Mars could be plastered with branding by companies more associated with Formula 1, an influential lobbyist has suggested. Robert Walker, a former congressman who now lobbies for Wexler & Walker Public Policy Associates, outlined the audacious plan in testimony to Congress. He said Nasa should seek out sponsorship from private firms to help fund its missions, much in the same way that motor racing teams festoon their cars with the branding of corporate backers. 'The sponsorships there pay for . operations costing $200-$300 million a year. That's enough for a whole . space flight,' Mr walker told the House Science, Space & Technology . Committee.

A retired British Royal Air Force Wing Commander died when he lost control of his replica First World War biplane and plummeted into a field. Brian North, MBE, 72, who was living in Colorado, USA, had assembled the two-thirds size SE5A aircraft himself after having the parts shipped out from England. He had completed the plane in October and had been flying it for about a month before the crash around a mile from Front Range Airport near Denver. Crash: Former RAF Wing Commander Brian North was killed after his replica First World War SE5A biplane slammed into a field in Colorado, USA . According to the Denver Post newspaper Mr North . called the control tower and got clearance to perform a 'touch-and-go' landing. He then made a series of right turns until he was approaching the . runway but suddenly called the control tower again and in a garbled transmission requested a 'full-stop' landing. The plane then plummeted to the ground and burst into flames about a mile north of the runway. Mr North had been a wing commander of . the Royal Air Force and was a member of the Most Excellent Order of the . British Empire . Dennis Heap, executive director of the airport, said: 'It was an absolutely beautiful day, there was no problem with the weather, it had to be something between man and machine. Tragedy: Mr North is pictured alongside the plane he built. He had shipped the parts to Colorado after originally constructing the aircraft in the UK . Mr North is seen in the cockpit of the two-thirds size SE5A as he taxies it for another flight . 'He was flying in a pattern one moment and down on the ground — crashed — the next moment,' Heap said. 'Mr North was well-known to us, an integral part of the airport community. 'It's unfortunate, but often distinguished people live among us and we don't know it until they die,"" he said. Mr Heap said the garbled transmission could indicate electrical failure caused the crash but the National Transportation Safety Board and the FAA will investigate the cause of the crash to make sure. A friend of Mr North's Michael Buehner-Coldrey, 67, who is also ex-RAF and had flown the plane a number of times, including on its maiden flight, said: 'I helped him take off for the half-hour flight and was due to take the plane out later. 'It was in perfect flying order, and going beautifully, which makes it all the sadder. It's a mystery what must have happened.' Passion: Mr North is pictured in a replica SE5A at RAF Halton before he shipped the aircraft to the United States . Mr Buehner-Coldrey, who lives in Aurora, Colorado, added: 'Brian was a very good friend of mine, a clever guy, good with his hands. 'He left school at 15 and had a 35-year career in the RAF. He did an apprenticeship at RAF Halton near Aylesbury, and went on to become a wing commander, specialising in engineering, and travelled around working on Harriers. 'He received the MBE from the Queen for his services, and not many people have that. 'After retiring from the RAF, he worked for 10 years as an immigration officer at Heathrow.

A man abducted by his grandparents at the age of five lives next door to them with his new wife and is preparing to be a father himself. The impression of a close and happy family life was emerging in the case of Richard Landers Jr, now  24, who was kidnapped by his grandparents as a young child. Police found the grandparents and Landers almost 19 years after he went missing in an operation, praised by his parents, Lisa Harter and Richard Landers Sr, who had almost given up hope of seeing him again. But both Landers and his new wife have praised rather than criticized his parents. In a Facebook post Bobbie Landers said his grandparents kept her husband 'safe' as a child. Baby: Michael Landers and his wife Bobbie, pictured left, are now expecting their own child and have posted ultrasound images and messages about how excited they are on Facebook, pictured right . 'His . ""grandparents"" didn't follow the law, but they did what was right. Sometimes, our US laws don't help or protect the people they should. He . was 5. He remembers his birth parents and what they were like,' it said. 'He had been living under his . grandparents care since he was a 6 month old baby. He was where he . wanted and needed to be to be safe and become the man he is today, my . husband and best friend.' Rather than the appearance of someone held against his will, Landers, who changed his name to Michael himself at age 18, has defended the grandparents who kidnapped and raised him. He is now preparing to be a father himself with his wife Bobbie, who has two sons from a previous relationship. They all live on one plot of land in Long Prairie, just outside Browerville, Minnesota and the young couple have been happily posting on Facebook about the upcoming birth of their child. In one post Bobbie writes: 'Mike had a girls name picked out . since he was younger so I feel like that's a sign too...he wants a lil tomgirl . and having 2 boys, I can't really see myself having a girly girl...can't wait . till we can find out!' They are clearly close to Landers grandparents who live alongside them under the aliases Raymond Michael Iddings and Susan Kay Iddings rather Richard E. and Ruth A. Landers as they were called at the time of the abduction. New man: Pictured outside his home in Browerville, Minnesota Michael Jeff Landers faced reporters as a 24-year-old . Overwhelmed: Michael Landers has been shocked by the reaction to his case. His wife, Bobby, pictured left, is pregnant and both have defended his grandparents who abducted him . Raymond Iddings has worked since 1999 . as a herdsman at Twin Eagle Dairy in nearby Clarissa, where owner . Patrick Lunemann described him as a 'dedicated, faithful' employee. Lunemann said he was in shock when he read a story about the case. He . said Iddings plays guitar at his church, and recalled a day last summer . when the couple brought their instruments to play for dairy workers. He . said he knew Michael slightly, saying he stopped in occasion - perhaps . to drop off Iddings' lunch if he had forgotten it. '(Landers) works at an auto parts place. That fits him perfectly, because Ray is . kind of a motorhead and Michael is the same way,' Lunemann said. But behind the image of a close and happy family living in a small town, the couple had a secret which has now been revealed. Landers' grandparents fled with five-year-old Richard during a custody dispute with his mother, Lisa Harter in July 1994 from Wolcottville, Indiana. Scroll down for video . Long lost family: Michael Jeff Landers' biological mother Lisa Harter is seen, left,  she has been described as entirely ecstatic at the news of her son's discovery after losing him at the age of five, right . Found: Landers' new home on property shared with his grandparents in Browerville is seen after his social security number led authorities to uncover his true identity . - Facebook user identifying himself as Michael Landers . Harter, who has mild developmental disabilities, divorced Landers' father. His parents obtained custody after Harter moved into a group home that could not accommodate children according to an attorney for Landers' mother,  Richard Muntz. After a while, she moved into an . apartment and gained custody of her son on weekends, and she filed a . petition to expand her custody rights when she remarried, he said . 'The judge gave her custody on a trial . basis, and before she could get him, that's when they left,' Muntz added. He said the grandparents withdrew $5,000 out of a home equity line, went out for breakfast and left town. 'The trail on this case went cold the day they disappeared. There was no trace of them after they left the restaurant,' he said. The grandparents were charged with . misdemeanor interference with custody, which was bumped up to a felony . in 1999. But the charge was dismissed in 2008 after the case went cold. Investigators . reopened the case in September after a conversation between Richard . Harter, Lisa Harter's new partner, and an Indiana State Police detective who . attended the same church prompted another search of Landers' Social . Security number. That turned . up a man with the same number and birthday with an address in Long . Prairie. Indiana . State Police then contacted Minnesota law enforcement agencies, which . began investigating along with the FBI and the Social Security . Administration. Family home: Landers lives next to the grandparents who adopted him in Minnesota with his wife . Better off: In a Facebook posting by a man claiming to be him, Landers writes his grandparents having been 'in the right' for taking him from his life with his mother at the age of five . - Investigator John R. Russell . Sheriff Peter Mikkelson said the case will now be forwarded to federal . authorities for possible charges. Landers, pictured for the first time outside the family plot on Friday, defended his grandparents although it is not clear how much of his back-story he was told. In a posting, believed to be a message from Landers' Facebook account to the Minneapolis . television station KARE's Facebook page he said they did well be him. 'For you people who jump . to conclusions you should find out the whole story I was where I needed . to be. My `grandparents' were in the the right I don't care what anyone . else thinks,' he says. According to court records, Landers . applied for the name change himself in November 2006. The application . doesn't say why he requested the change. Other witnesses from the time have also defended the grandparents. John R. Russell, who spent . several months investigating the disappearance with the LaGrange County . Sheriff's Department in Indiana, said Landers' mother and stepfather were . unemployed and lived in a car at the time. Overjoyed: Richard Landers Sr has spoken of his relief that his son has been found. He says he hopes to re-establish contact with both his son and his parents . Vanished: In 1994 Richard Wayne Lander Jr disappeared at the age of five from Wolcottville, Indiana before he was found 19 years later at the age of 24 living in Minnesota . 'These . people (the grandparents) were nice people. It was wrong for them to do . it, but I can understand why,' Russell said. 'But I also didn't think . the child would be in any danger at all with them.' Harter's attorney has refuted the claims and said she spent . only three days living in a car and it was with Landers' biological . father. Both parents said they were delighted following the news that their son had been found. Richard Harter said his wife was 'the happiest woman on earth' on hearing the news he was found. 'We always just kept it in the back . of our minds that we believed we were going to see him again,' said . Richard Landers Sr, who was speaking to KARE after hearing the news. 'Until I get to actually walk up and say hello to him again, I don't know if it's going to be real,' he added. He has also said that he hopes to re-establish contact with his parents. A spokeswoman with the U.S. Attorney's office in Minnesota, Jeanne Cooney, said charges in such a case could be related to non-custodial kidnapping, whether the child was exploited, abused, trafficked or being used to obtain benefits. The small town is buzzing with the news. Rich Wall, a retired jeweler, said some residents speculated that some people knew of Landers' history but kept quiet. He said it was the most notable news since a grisly triple homicide there in 2003. 'My grandson called last night and said, `Long Prairie made the news again,' Wall said.

Weather warnings for ice and snow have been issued by the Met Office for large parts of the country, as temperatures are expected to plummet to -4C in some parts - including Heathrow Airport. The warnings for today, tomorrow and Monday show the extent of the snow warnings that the Met Office have issued . Dancing at dawn: The rambler hops carefully from one slippery rock to another while watching the arrival of more inhospitable conditions in the North East . And so it begins: The Northumberland border was dusted with snow earlier yesterday, as the Met Office warns more snow is on the way . Monday has been marked out as a ‘snow . day’ by forecasters, with most of the country carpeted in at least an . inch of the white stuff, which is expected to start falling tomorrow . night. The Met Office has issued a 'yellow' warning of severe weather for Wales, south and west England, north England and east of Scotland as the snow and ice hits the country. Met Office spokesman Craig Snell said: 'There will be a band of rain, sleet and snow moving south east from Scotland on Monday, and another band of sleet and snow will be hot on the heels of it.' Up to 5cm of snow is predicted to settle . over central and eastern England tomorrow night, with light snow . already falling over high ground in Scotland this morning. There have already been reports of flurries of snow in Birmingham and Luton today, but these have 'fizzled out'.

More than 6,000 braved the cold weather to see the person in their eccentric costume at the 200-year-old Whittlesey Straw Bear Festival - but this year it was so cold that character had to wear gloves . The Met has issued a snow warning for large parts of the country on Monday. 'We've got a warning out for much of Monday across a great swathe of England,' he said. Mr Snell said that snow would fall across the country, but is not expected to reach areas below the M4. He also warned that the weather could turn from rain in Scotland to snow in England, because of the colder air. He warned that after Monday, the east may suffer snow flurries from the north sea, but the west of the country will be very cold and frosty. Councils across the country have warned that many residential roads will not be gritted or cleared. The wintry weather could cause havoc for public transport. And so it begins: The Northumberland border was dusted with snow earlier today . Brace yourselves: Early morning mists cover Evercreech in Somerset as the whole country is threatened by a snowy fortnight, starting tomorrow . 'Flurries': A bird alights on ground carpeted with a light covering of snow close to the Northumberland border . Train . services could face disruption because of freezing temperatures and the . threat of snow setting, according to Network Rail. Meanwhile, Manchester Airport said it was ‘on alert for . snow’ and Heathrow and Gatwick Airport said there was ‘a possibility’ of disruption . on Monday, depending on the levels of snowfall and temperatures. A spokesman for Heathrow Airport said: . 'The airport is in constant discussion with airlines and the Met Office . about the weather, so they can be as prepared as possible.' In December, less than an inch of snow caused five airports, including Stansted and Luton, to close. And three inches of snow led Heathrow Airport to cancel half its flights last February. Preparation: JCB's load rock salt onto articulated lorrys at Winsford Rock Salt Mine in Cheshire . Preparation: Highways Agency maintenance operative Gary Cantellow looks at gritting salt at their South Mimms Depot in Hertfordshire . But it admitted council gritters and snowploughs could not clear every street. A spokesman said: ‘In the side roads . which aren’t gritted by councils, drivers will need to be extra . careful.’ The AA warned three-quarters of motorists were not ready for . the weather this weekend – with those in London the least prepared. The RAC said it is expecting up to . 56,000 breakdowns and widespread disruption on the roads which could . hamper millions of motorists if the expected snow arrives over the . weekend. It has placed extra patrols on . stand-by to help stranded motorists and said call-outs are expected to . rise by 20 per cent or more. A spokesman said: 'In the event of . heavy snow, the RAC is urging motorists to avoid all non-essential . journeys as there is a risk Britain's road network could grind to a . halt.' RAC roadside operations manager Matt . Dallaway said: 'We know from bitter experience that the UK's roads . struggle to cope with a sudden burst of snowfall. 'The RAC could be dealing with in excess of 11,000 breakdowns on Monday if there is widespread snow. 'We would advise motorists to check . the weather forecast and think very carefully about whether their . journey is essential before setting off, particularly if they're . planning to travel a long distance. 'Even half an inch of snow can bring . roads to a standstill and leave drivers stranded in their cars.' Tesco said its sales of shovels are up more than five times last week's levels and expects them to increase even further in the coming days.

A month before she died, police were . told that Esack had strangled his estranged wife until she was . unconscious in the hairdressers where he later killed her. In October . 2011, she told officers Esack had threatened to kill her with his . shotgun. Weeks later, he voluntarily handed in the gun. The Independent Police Complaints Commission is investigating why the force did not refer the case after Mrs Esack’s murder. Esack was brought up in Middlesbrough . by his English mother while his Trinidadian father, a civil engineer, . worked in Abu Dhabi. Bloodied: This image shows the knife used by Ivan Esack to attack his wife. The 8-inch blade bent and the tip broke off under the ferocity of the attack .

Heartbroken: Jim Wilkinson, second from left, father of Natalie Esack, is accompanied by family members as he leaves Maidstone Crown Court today . He moved to London and worked in Harrods, boasting of mixing with the rich and famous. Esack did a drama course but failed dismally to make a career of it and his father bought him a new house in Ashford, Kent. Grief-stricken: Justin Khadaroo, the boyfriend of victim Natalie Esack is pictured . He met Natalie at a gym and, despite . her family’s concern, they were married in 2006. His father funded the . beauty and hair salon for her on Ashford High Street. Esack joined the police in 2003. Defence psychiatrist Timothy Rogers told the court: ‘He probably very . much enjoyed the power and prestige of being a police officer.’ But Esack had to sit a basic exam four . times before briefly becoming a detective. Then, he began snorting £500 . worth of cocaine a month and drinking heavily. In 2009, he quit on the . spot when asked to change from casual clothes into a shirt and tie. Esack’s numerous affairs with men and . women drove his wife to leave. But he bombarded her with aggressive and . threatening texts and calls, and on Boxing Day 2011, she reluctantly . went on a doomed ‘make or break’ holiday to Mexico. Kent Police yesterday insisted their hands were tied because Mrs Esack refused to press charges. But senior investigating officer DCI . Paul Fotheringham admitted: ‘The fact Ivan Esack used to be a police . officer – somebody whose role was to protect people – makes me extremely . embarrassed.’ Ashford Tories said Esack was a member . but there was no record of Mr Green speaking to him or that he had been . considered as a councillor. Detectives knew Natalie Esack suffered domestic abuse from her estranged husband before he knifed her to death, it has emerged. Hairdresser Mrs Esack, 33, spoke to officers on four separate occasions about ex-police detective Ivan Esack, from 2009 up until a month before her death. But, according to police, Mrs Esack was unwilling for 38-year-old Esack to face prosecution and she refused to co-operate with their inquiries. Tragic: Mrs Esack, 33, spoke to officers on four separate occasions about ex-police detective Ivan Esack, from 2009 up until a month before her death. Weeks before he fatally stabbed her, Mrs Esack told police he tried to strangle her but she apparently refused to divulge further details. Detective Chief Inspector Paul Fotheringham, of the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate, said he could not say whether police could have prevented her from being killed as Esack was a 'determined' man. But he said: 'Certainly, with the information that we found now, and if Natalie had given us evidence or a statement in relation to the abuse, we could have done something about it.' Police said that 5ft 1in hairdresser Mrs Esack failed to return their phone calls or attend meetings to follow up the reports of abuse. December . 14, 2009: Police attended an abandoned 999 call at the Esacks’ home . after Mrs Esack called asking for help following a bust-up. No offences . were identified by police . October 25 2011 Following the breakdown . of their marriage, Mrs Esack visited Ashford police station to report a . series of abusive text messages and calls from her husband. It was noted that Esack had access to a firearm and had made previous threats to shoot her and her father. Mrs Esack received harassment advice from police. She sent Esack a text . message telling him any further contact between them should be via a . solicitor. The following day police visited Esack and told him of Mrs Esack’s wish to have nothing more to do with him. A month later Esack voluntarily surrendered his firearms licence and gun to police. February 11 2012: Mrs Esack contacted Kent Police after Esack told . her he intended to kill himself. Officers visited and Esack was admitted . to hospital for assessment but later sent home . March 13 2012: A month before the killing, her new boyfriend, Justin Khadaroo, dialled 999. Police attended but Mrs Esack said she did not want to give a statement . or support a prosecution. However, she did confirm that Esack had tried . to strangle her the previous day. In the background Mrs Esack could be heard telling Esack: 'You aren’t allowed to come in, you tried to kill me.' They described her as a 'private' person keen to shield Esack from prosecution despite his behaviour towards her. Mr . Fotheringham said: 'We did have reports in relation to Natalie . suffering domestic abuse which we did follow up with Natalie but she . didn’t want to support any prosecution against Ivan. 'Natalie . was a very private person and it’s clear that she knew that if she . reported Ivan to us it would impact on him. Being the type of person she . was, she didn’t want that to happen.' The detective said it was common for abused people not to want to support prosecutions of their abusers, and that he did not want Mrs Esack’s unwillingness to engage with police to be seen as a criticism of her. He added: 'People suffering from domestic abuse, I think, certainly want it to stop but they don’t necessarily want anything to happen to the person perpetrating the abuse. Grim: This picture shows the murder scene in Ashford . 'In this case, certainly from what Natalie told her family and her friends, she was almost more interested in not harming Ivan than what was happening to her.' Asked whether police could have prevented her death, Mr Fotheringham said: 'I don’t know. A determined individual as he was and with the marriage breakdown, I don’t know whether we could have done, to be honest.' No referral was made to the police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Commission, about the force’s previous contact and no disciplinary issues were found, he added. An IPCC spokeswoman said: 'The IPCC did not receive a referral from Kent Police in connection with previous police contact with Natalie Esack before her death. 'We understand Kent considered it but felt it didn’t meet the referral criteria. 'Kent Police has provided us with further information regarding this decision, which we are considering.'","Ivan Esack, 38, was today found guilty of murdering Natalie Esack, .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 14:46 EST, 21 July 2011 . Four elderly Kenyans have won an important fight in their battle for compensation over  horrific acts of torture. The group, all in their 80s, say they were assaulted in British-run detention camps during the  country’s war of independence. They allege 'unspeakable acts of brutality' during the Mau Mau rebellion against colonial rule between 1952 and 1960. Demanding an apology: The four Kenyans are taking the British Government to court over allegations of torture during the Mau Mau uprising . The Kenyans (left to right) Wambugu Wa Nyingi, Jane Muthoni Mara, Paulo Nzili and Ndiku Mutua, outside the Royal Courts of Justice, . In a 'historic' ruling, the High Court said they had 'arguable  cases in law' and rejected Government attempts to have the case thrown out. The Foreign Office, which denies liability, said the group had left it too late to claim and the case should be targeted against the assault perpetrators. The judgment, by Mr Justice McCombe, clears the way for a month-long hearing before Easter where they will tell their stories. If they win, it could lead to thousands more demanding compensation via no-win no-fee lawyers. One of the claimants, Wambugu Wa Nyingi, says he was suspended by his feet and severely beaten while cold water was poured on his face to stop him breathing. Ndiku Mutwiwa Mutua and Paulo Muoka Nzili were castrated. Jane Muthoni Mara says she was suffered appalling sexual abuse. Round up: Members of the British Police marshalling over Mau Mau suspects . Some 12,000 rebels are thought to have been killed in the battle for independence. Solcitor Martyn Day said that this hearing, which will decide the Government's argument that the claims cannot proceed because they have been brought outside the legal time limit, was in itself a 'major victory.' He said: 'A lot of the evidence about what happened will be put into the public domain, and people will be able to judge for themselves. 'So, even if the judge rules that the trial cannot go ahead because of the time that has passed, just having that trial is a major victory.' The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) had asked the judge to block the litigation now on the basis that any claim could only have been brought against the direct perpetrators of the alleged assaults or their employer at the time - the Colonial Government in Kenya - and not the British Government. But the judge rejected the strike out . application today saying: 'I have not found that there was systematic . torture nor, if there was, the UK government is liable. 'I have simply decided that these claimants have arguable cases in law.' 'The rival factual contentions are hotly disputed. I have found that it is impossible at this stage of the proceedings to decide that the FCO must be correct in its factual assessments and arguments. 'It has been necessary, therefore, to consider the case on the basis that the claimants' version of the facts may prove at trial to be correct and to ask whether, on that basis, they have an arguable claim in law against the UK Government.' Prison camp: Thousands of suspected rebels were rounded up during Kenya's Mau Mau rebellion . The claimants, Ndiku Mutwiwa Mutua, Paulo Muoka Nzili, Wambugu Wa Nyingi and Jane Muthoni Mara - all but one of whom are in their 80s - flew 4,000 miles from their rural homes for the trial this spring which concentrated on events in detention camps between 1954 and 1959, but were not in court today. At that hearing the judge was told that Mr Mutua and Mr Nzili had been castrated, Mr Nyingi was beaten unconscious in an incident in which 11 men were clubbed to death, and Mrs Mara had been subjected to appalling sexual abuse. The four elderly Kenyans are claiming they were tortured and sexually . assaulted in British-run detention camps during the 1950s Mau Mau . uprising. At least 12,000 rebels were killed in the bloody fight for independence with appalling atrocities committed by both sides. The Kenyan Humans Right Commission say that 90,000 Kenyans were executed or tortured during the uprising, with 160,000 detained. Among those rounded up as the British . colonial administration tried to suppress the Mau Mau was Hussein . Onyango Obama, the U.S. President’s grandfather, who was imprisoned for . two years and tortured, according to his family. In his ruling, the judge rejected the FCO's case that the claim did not have a real prospect of success, essentially because there was no relevant duty of care. He commented: 'In my judgment, it may well be thought strange, or perhaps even 'dishonourable', that a legal system which will not in any circumstances admit into its proceedings evidence obtained by torture should yet refuse to entertain a claim against the Government in its own jurisdiction for that Government's allegedly negligent failure to prevent torture which it had the means to prevent, on the basis of a supposed absence of a duty of care. 'Furthermore, resort to technicality, here the rules of constitutional theory, to rule such a claim out of court appears particularly misplaced at such an early stage of the action.' Foreign Office minister for Africa Henry Bellingham said: 'It is right that those who feel they have a case are free to take it to the courts. 'We understand the pain and grievance felt by those, on all sides, who were involved in the divisive and bloody events of the emergency period in Kenya. 'Despite today's judgment, the Government will continue to defend fully these proceedings, given the length of time elapsed and the complex legal and constitutional questions the case raises. Locked up: Members of the Mau Mau rounded up and entrapped in a police cage in Nairobi . 'We have taken note of the judgment and are considering next steps. 'Our relationship with Kenya and its people has moved on since the emergency period. 'We are now partners and the UK is one of the largest bilateral donors in Kenya.' The news was welcomed by Archbishop Desmond . Tutu, who said: 'Responding with generosity to the plea of the Kenyan . victims is not a matter of legal niceties.","Four elderly Kenyans claiming they were sexually assaulted and abused in British-run camps .

A grieving mother who sued her employer after she was told she had to remove pictures of her dead daughter from her office space has lost her court case. Cecelia Ingraham sued Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical after her boss said she could no longer talk about daughter Tatiana, who died from leukemia. She was told her colleagues were 'uncomfortable' with her tendency to discuss the tragedy and that she was causing a 'disruption'. Grieving mother Cecelia Ingraham was told not to talk about her daughter (posed by model) Ms Ingraham sued for emotional . distress and constructive discharge but the Superior Court of New . Jersey, Appellate Division, found for the company. Ms Ingraham had worked for the firm for 12 years and by 2006, she was an administrative assistant in a marketing department. Her only child Tatiana had been diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia in 2003. She initially fought off the disease and went into remission but it returned in 2005 and she died in May that year. Ms Ingraham was devastated and kept pictures of her daughter and her ballet slippers displayed in her cubicle at work. One-and-a-half years after Tatiana died, . a human resources manager told Ms Ingraham's boss he had received . complaints about her conduct and interaction with other workers. She sued Ortho-McNeil and an HR manager for intentional infliction of emotional distress, constructive discharge and discrimination. Carl DeStefanis then held a meeting with the assistant, allegedly telling her she was making her colleagues 'uncomfortable', according to website leagle.com. They had reported being at a loss for . 'what else that we can say that we have not said already' and said they . had resorted to avoiding her. Ms . Ingraham was allegedly told to remove her daughter's pictures because . they were a 'disruption' and to stop talking about Tatiana 'because she . is dead'. 'If courts had to preside over every . instance of rude and thoughtless boss behaviour, they'd never have time . to consider any other kinds of cases.' Judge Victor Ashrafi . She is said to have asked Mr DeStefanis if he was telling her to act ' as if she [Tatiana] did not exist'. He replied: 'Yes'. He apparently said: 'If you have the need or urge to talk about her you can come into my office and speak of her behind closed doors.' Ms Ingraham left work sobbing and never went back. She later went to her cardiologist with heart palpitations and had to have angioplasty. This led to short-term disability leave and eventually she resigned. She then filed a law suit against Ortho-McNeil and Mr DeStefanis for intentional infliction of emotional distress, constructive dischage and discrimination. She lost the case because the court held she had not shown Mr DeStefanis intended to cause her distress and had acted extremelya nd outrageously. She had to show that Mr DeStefanis had intended to cause her distress or been reckless as to whether he was doing so and acted extremely and outrageously . The judgment said: 'There is no question that any reasonable employer should know that telling a grieving mother not to talk about her deceased daughter might cause emotional distress but a severe reaction was not a risk that one should predict.' Judge Victor Ashrafi wrote: 'The workplace has too many personal conflicts and too much behaviour that might be perceived as uncivil for the courts to be used as the umpire for all but the most extreme workplace disputes. 'It's true that if courts had to preside over every instance of rude and thoughtless boss behaviour, they'd never have time to consider any other kinds of cases. 'For this reason, courts tend to set a pretty high bar when it comes to determining that behaviour is ""extreme"".'","Cecelia Ingraham's daughter died from leukemia .

Prince William was so attached to his nanny Olga Powell, who was at his side throughout his childhood, that he cancelled four high-profile engagements to be at her funeral earlier this year. But the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge plan to break with royal tradition by not employing a full-time nanny. The couple are determined to be 'hands-on parents' and Kate is planning to look after her child without the help of someone 24 hours a day. Break with tradition: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, pictured in November, are wanting to be 'hands-on' parents . Unusual: Prince William in his pushchair with his nanny Olga Powell in Regent's Park in London in 1984. Despite growing up with a full-time nanny, William and his wife Kate are not to employ full-time help . Kate and Wills may . employ a part-time nanny who will fulfill the role as a 'babysitter' by . looking after their baby when they have to attend events. But Kate's parents Carole and Michael Middleton will also be there to lend a hand as much as possible. One of the couple's friends said: 'Catherine and William are . determined to be hands-on parents.' 'Her parents are very excited about the baby and will help out . as much as possible.' 'They will, probably, use a part-time . nanny to help them out when they have to attend events and don’t have a . babysitter, but they don’t want a full-time nanny.' Their decision not to employ a full-time nanny will be a major break with royal tradition. But it is not first time the royal couple have decided to forgo the services of full-time help. The couple do not employ any staff at their home in North Wales, where the Duke serves as a search-and-rescue helicopter pilot at Anglesey, apart from a cleaner who visits weekly. Kate has spoken of how she enjoys doing the cooking and household chores. In contrast, Kate Middleton was cared for by her mother Carole, pictured together in 1982, and did not have a full-time nanny . And at university William and his housemates took it in turns to do the cooking and shared household chores - including shopping for food. The Duke of Cambridge's nannies played such an important role in his life that the son of one of them, Tom Pettifer, was a page boy at the royal wedding. Tom, William's godson, is the youngest son of Alexandra Shân 'Tiggy' Pettifer, known as Tiggy Legge-Bourke, who was hired as a nanny to Harry and William . after Charles and Diana announced their separation. Tiggy . helped comfort the princes after their mother's death in 1997. She was so close to the boys after their parents’ divorce that she, memorably, . once described them as 'my babies'. She retired from the Prince of Wales's service when she married in October . 1999. In October, William attended the private funeral of his former nanny Olga Powell, cancelling four high-profile engagements in the north east, which his wife had to attend alone. The Duke of Cambridge's nannies played such an important role in his life that the son of one of them, Tom Pettifer, pictured, was a page boy at the royal wedding . Mrs Powell was at his side through both childhood and the most important days in his adult life. The loving, but strict nanny, was widely credited for having a massive impact on the lives of both Prince William and Harry as they were growing up. Mrs Powell, who was widowed after just six years of marriage when she was 52, came to work for Princess Diana when Prince William was just six months old. Although very loving, she was renowned for not taking any nonsense from the young boys, and famously would give them a clip around the ear if they were ever naughty. Former Royal nanny Tiggy Pettifer, who was hired as a nanny to Harry and William after Charles and Diana announced their separation . Another nanny, Barbara Barnes, was sacked by Diana when William was four because she envied their strong bond. In world's apart, Kate Middleton was brought up by her mother, Carole, a former air stewardess who spent her early years in a council flat in Southall, an unfashionable London suburb. The woman considered to be most influential in the Prince of Wales's life was his beloved nanny Mabel Anderson, employed by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh to care for their four children. She had such a special place in the hearts of the Royal family that she was called upon to represent the Duke of York at a funeral at the Chapel . Royal, in St James’s Palace, earlier this year. Mabel's 80th birthday party was arranged by Charles to take place at the royal residence, Clarence House. When she retired, Charles secured her a lifelong grace-and-favour home in a wing of Frogmore House, Windsor Great Park, and personally supervised its re-decoration using his own designer. Mabel, who was once described by the Prince of Wales as 'a haven of security, the great haven', was said to be a great friend of the Queen's. The Queen met Mabel, a policeman's daughter from Elgin, . Scotland, in 1949 after she replied to an advertisement, not . knowing it was from the royal household. It was to be an assistant nanny to help the then Princess . Elizabeth who was pregnant with Charles. Despite her lack of formal . training, Mabel, at 22, was chosen by the future Queen because Her . Majesty liked her quiet, unassuming manner. It was Mabel who put the children to bed, told them stories, . patched up their cuts and bruises and hit upon the idea of teaching . the royal corgis hide and seek with Princess Anne so that she . wouldn't miss Charles when he started school. She even sent Charles bottles of Vosene shampoo for his dandruff . at boarding school. 'Haven of security': Princess Anne's son, Peter Phillips, on his way to nursery school with his nanny, Mabel Anderson in 1980 . Each . Christmas, Prince Charles sends a chauffeur-driven car to take Mrs . Anderson . to Sandringham, where she is treated like a cherished member of the . family rather than an employee. A St James’s Palace spokesman said: 'It is too early to say whether the Duke and Duchess will employ a nanny.' The news comes as it was revealed by the Mail on Sunday the couple are considering skipping Christmas at Sandringham and may instead spend December 25 with Kate’s parents Carole and Michael. Charles on his second birthday in 1951 with nanny Mabel Anderson, who became a close friend to the Queen . ‘It is being discussed but has not yet been decided,’ said a source. ‘Carole is keen for Kate to spend Christmas with the family. It will be their last Christmas at the family home before the Middletons move house. ‘At home Kate will be able to relax and put her feet up. Christmas at Sandringham can be very busy and stressful with everyone arriving. There is always lots going on, big dinners and lots of outfit changes to contend with.’ The family have reportedly bought a £4.7 million, seven-bedroom mansion.","Duke and Duchess determined to be 'hands-on parents'

Just over 12 per cent of the teenagers interviewed as part of the study had thought about suicide (file picture) Roughly one in 25 teenagers in the U.S. has attempted suicide, while one in eight has thought about it, according to a national study based on interviews with thousands of teens. Researchers said the numbers were similar to the prevalence of lifetime suicidal thinking and attempts reported by adults, suggesting the teenage years are an especially vulnerable time. The results are based on face-to-face interviews of close to 6,500 teens in the United States, along with questionnaires filled out by their parents. Along with asking the youths about their suicidal thinking, plans and attempts, interviewers also determined which teens fit the bill for a range of mental disorders. Matthew Nock, a psychologist who worked on the study at Harvard University, said: 'What adults say is, the highest risk time for first starting to think about suicide is in adolescence.' The findings, which appeared in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, suggest just over 12 per cent of the youths had thought about suicide, while four per cent had made a suicide plan and four per cent had attempted suicide. Nock and his colleagues found almost all teens who thought about or attempted suicide had a mental disorder, including depression, bipolar disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or problems with drug or alcohol abuse. More than half of the youths were already in treatment when they reported suicidal behavior, which Nock said was both encouraging and disturbing. He said: 'We know that a lot of the kids who are at risk and thinking about suicide are getting (treatment).' But he warned: 'We don't know how to stop them - we don't have any evidence-based treatments for suicidal behavior.' The findings leave many questions unanswered. Because most youths who think about suicide never go on to make an actual plan or attempt it, doctors need to get better at figuring out which ones are most at risk of putting themselves in danger, according to Nock. More than half of the youths were already in treatment when they reported suicidal behavior, which researchers say is both encouraging and disturbing (file picture) Once those youths are identified, researchers will also have to determine the best way to treat them, since it's clear a lot of current methods aren't preventing suicidal behavior, he said. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, suicide is the third leading cause of death for people between the ages of ten and 24. Although girls are more likely to attempt suicide - a pattern confirmed by Nock's study - boys have higher rates of death by suicide.","Just over 12 per cent of teens had thought about suicide, researchers say .

"By . Nick Mcdermott . PUBLISHED: . 19:19 EST, 3 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:10 EST, 4 January 2013 . Fed up with our perpetually soggy weather? Then here’s some news to further dampen your spirits. Forecasters warned yesterday that the country faces even more intense downpours in future years, with increased risks of flooding. The number of days of ‘extreme rainfall’ – particularly heavy downpours – increased by 40 per cent last year, making 2012 the UK’s second wettest year ever. Extreme flooding: Only part of a road can be seen above the flood water from the River Ouse near Cawood, North Yorkshire, a sight which may become less shocking according to forecasters . Extreme rainfall should occur once every 100 days, but last year it happened every 70 days, or almost once every two months. The . top five wettest years since records began in 1910 are 2000, 2012, . 1954, 2008 and 2002 – meaning four of the five have occurred since the . beginning of this century. Professor . Julia Slingo, chief scientist at the Met Office, said: ‘The trend . towards more extreme rainfall events is one we are seeing around the . world, in countries such as India and China, and now potentially here in . the UK. ‘It’s essential we . look at how this may affect rainfall patterns over the next decade and . beyond, so we can advise on the frequency of extreme weather in the . future and the potential for more surface and river flooding.’ Annual . rainfall increased by 5 per cent in the 30-year period between . 1981-2010 when compared to 1961-1990. But last year alone, the average . rainfall was up 15 per cent. Increasingly wet: Heavy downpours, resulting in scenes like this in York New Years day, have become more common in the past 13 years . Blame the climate change: Increased sea-surface temperatures and melting ice bergs in the Arctic could be behind the wet weather . Mother Nature's fault: Although it is easy to blame climate change some experts say extreme weather is merely a result of natural variation . Figures released by the Met Office . show last year’s total rainfall was 52½ inches across Britain, just a . quarter of an inch less than the wettest ever year, 2000. Broken . down into the countries that make up the UK, England experienced its . wettest year since records began with just over 44 inches, an inch more . than in 2000. Wales saw its third wettest year in 2012, and it was . Scotland’s 17th. Met Office . forecasters said changes in sea surface temperatures and reducing . amounts of Arctic sea-ice could be influencing the increase in rainfall. Another . theory is that the 0.7C increase in global temperatures since . pre-industrial times is causing the wet weather because a warmer . atmosphere can hold more moisture, leading to the greater risk of heavy . rain. Soon less weird: Sights such as this, two people canoeing through Aberfoyle, Scotland in November last year, could become increasingly common if forecasters are to be believed . Met Office forecaster Dan Williams said: ‘At the moment, we do not have a definitive answer to why Britain has had so many wet years since 2000. It could be down to natural variation or it could be other factors, including potential increases in global temperatures.’ Professor Nigel Arnell of Reading University said we are likely to see more flooding in the future. He said: ‘Rainfall has increased in recent decades over many parts of the Northern Hemisphere and we’re seeing rain falling in heavier bursts. 2012 for the UK fits with that picture and we’ve seen the effect of all this rain with disruptive flooding across many parts of the country.’ With four of the five wettest years on record occurring since 2000, many were quick to blame climate change for the increased rainfall. Wetter than ever: England experienced it's wettest year since records began in 2012 . But some experts suggested it was just a result of natural variation, with a similar pattern of wet weather also occurring in the 1950s. Britain’s third highest annual rainfall was recorded in 1954, while two other years in the decade are amongst the 20 wettest. One theory is that in both the 1950s and the past decade warmer than usual sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic altered the jet stream, causing wet weather to remain over Britain for longer periods of time. Two men were taken to hospital with head injuries yesterday after falling into a flooded river when a footbridge collapsed. The pair, aged 65 and 55, were pulled from the River Seven at High Askew near Cropton on the North York Moors. They were believed to have been part of a shooting party.","Four out of five of the UK's wettest years have occurred since 2000 .

We've all been there: the annoying moment when your iPhone goes off and you're busy doing something else. You stop what you're doing, reach into your pocket or bag, and by the time you've pulled out the phone, you're too late to draw your finger across the screen and answer the dratted thing. Well, if you thought YOU were annoyed by missed calls, you obviously weren't as annoyed as this Japanese man. Scroll down for video . No more missed calls: The Japanese inventor demonstrates how his gadget works . As this hilarious footage (see below) shows, he has devoted serious thought to the first world problem of missed iPhone calls. Obviously inspired by the quick-draw technique of gunslinging cowboys in Western movies, the young man has designed a holster for the iPhone that can, apparently, be strapped to the limb of your choice. The YouTube clip shows a detailed drawing of the holster, which seems to be an iPhone holder attached to an extending plastic arm that you strap to your arm or leg. When the phone rings, you flick your wrist and the arm shoots out, bringing your phone to your ear in a second. When the phone is not in use, it remains hidden up your sleeve. On the clip, the man demonstrates in agonising detail how the quick draw holster works. How it works: A drawing shows the design of the iPhone gadget . Moshi-moshi? The inventor answers his phone within seconds . Gunslinger: The man appears to have modelled his design - and technique - on quick-draw cowboys in Westerns . Shoots from the sleeve: The iPhone is always close to hand . In a variety of increasingly bizarre locations (sitting on a loo, leaping backwards onto his bed, lying beside a toy train track on a building's roof), the inventor shows how the iPhone can be at his ear almost immediately it rings. He looks extremely pleased with himself as he stares into the camera. His invention does not always work perfectly, though, with the iPhone flying out of its holder and across the room on a couple of occasions. You can wear it on your leg... Or on both legs, should the mood take you . Why he felt the need to test his gadget on top of a tall building while lying next to a train-set is anyone's guess, but it hasn't harmed the ratings, which were pushing 1,000,000 this morning, two days after the clip was posted on YouTube. Most of the comments posted by viewers were positive, but not everyone was so impressed. One person wrote: 'Someone needs a girlfriend.' The inventor does a commando-style roll out of his apartment to demonstrate the holster's versatility .

Two British computer hackers who stole unreleased Michael Jackson tracks after breaking into Sony Music's servers have escaped jail. Jackson fanatics James Marks, 27, and James McCormick, 26, planned to sell the exclusive tracks after targetting Sony, who own the copyright to the late singer's work. But the pair, who met through an online fan forum, were thwarted when officers traced the hack to their home computers. Theft: James Marks, 27, and James McCormick, 26, were ordered to carry out 100 hours of community service each after stealing 7,900 files, including unreleased Michael Jackson tracks, from Sony Music . Marks, from Daventry, and McCormick, from Blackpool, were each ordered to do 100 hours of community service and handed one year suspended sentences today at Leicester Crown Court. The pair stole a total of 7,900 files from the Sony system, including tracks, component parts, artwork and videos. The fans specifically searched for Jackson's material, which had been the subject of much speculation since his high-profile death from a drugs overdose in June 2009. Investigation: Police discovered chatlogs between the two hackers that suggested they planned to sell or trade the stolen material . After downloading the files to their home computers, McCormick wrote a computer script, enabling them to speed up the process and steal material from other artists. Chatlogs between Marks and MCCormick revealed that the pair had planned to trade some of the prized files. They were arrested in May 2011 after Sony Music identified the security breach and notified the police. The Serious Organised Crime Agency launched an investigation that led to the pair, who admitted two offences under the Computer Misuse Act and the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act in September last year. The Jackson estate sold the rights to his back catalogue to Sony Music nine months after his death. The $250 million deal was the biggest in music recording history, giving the record label the rights to sell the pop legend’s entire back catalogue as well as unreleased tracks. The music giant can also sell the artist's music in advertisements and computer games. Mick Jameison, from the Serious Organised Crime Agency's Cyber Department, said: 'These men stole thousands of copyrighted files belonging to Sony Music. 'Our remit is to protect businesses as well the public, and we will continue to work closely with law enforcement and industry partners to tackle online criminality.'","James Marks and James McCormick to do 100 hours community service .

Princess Diana’s step-brother last night revealed he had been arrested following a domestic dispute during which his wife called the police. The Earl of Dartmouth, 63, was taken into custody on suspicion of assault following the late-night incident in November, during which officers were called to the couple’s flat in the fashionable Bayswater district of London. He was not charged, and yesterday described the event as the ‘worst day of my life’. Dispute: The Earl of Dartmouth, seen with his wife Fiona, was taken into custody on suspicion of assault following the late-night incident in November . His wife Fiona, a former model, insisted she had called the police after becoming ‘disorientated’, adding that ‘nothing had happened’. The Earl, a hereditary peer and member of the European Parliament for the UK Independence Party, spoke out after details of the incident began to emerge. A friend said the couple had had a row on the evening of November 15 over an apparently innocuous decision about which room the television should be put in at their home in Devon. Lady Dartmouth went to bed and fell into a ‘deep sleep’. But the Earl later wanted to pursue the matter and ‘shook her awake’. The friend insisted there was no physical altercation and said the couple had not been drinking. The Earl of Dartmouth is the son of Raine McCorquodale, who was Princess Diana's step-mother . He said the couple were ‘very close’, adding that they were due to travel to Strasbourg together this weekend. In a statement yesterday the Earl said: ‘After my wife went to bed I decided to wake her and clarify my point of view. Looking back it was an unwise thing to do as Fiona was deeply asleep and became disorientated. Her alarm resulted in a call to the police. ‘By the time the police arrived, there was no issue. Fiona told them repeatedly she did not wish to take the matter further and there had been no physical altercation. ‘The police attempted to persuade her to say she had been assaulted and she should press charges even though we both separately explained it was just the sort of disagreement which often happens within a marriage. They then placed me under arrest and I was held for several hours until they realised nothing of consequence had occurred and no charges could be made.’ Lady Dartmouth said: ‘When William woke me from a deep sleep I was rather disorientated and rang the police. ‘When they arrived I emphasised I was never going to press any charges because absolutely nothing had happened.’ The Earl of Dartmouth’s mother, Raine McCorquodale, divorced his father in 1976 and married the then Earl Spencer later that year, becoming Lady Diana Spencer’s step-mother in the process. Lady Dartmouth was born Fiona Campbell, in Melbourne, Australia. Her first husband, Matt Handbury, is Rupert Murdoch’s nephew, son of Geoff Handbury and Helen Murdoch. The couple divorced in 2000 and she married the Earl of Dartmouth in 2009. A friend last night said Lord Dartmouth had not ruled out a complaint against the police over the apparent leak of information about the incident. A UKIP source described the incident as a ‘private matter’.","The Earl of Dartmouth, 63, was arrested on suspicion of assault following a domestic dispute .

A 999 caller delivered a terrifying running commentary to an operator as he watched a woman stab a grandmother to death in the street. Nicholas Morris screamed, 'She's bloody killing her!' as he watched Nicola Edgington, 32, go on a violent early morning rampage near Bexleyheath high street, a court heard today. He saw the killer first try to stab Kerry Clark, then 22, before going into a butcher's and grabbing another knife, which she used to almost decapitate 59-year-old Sally Hodkin. Defendant: Nicola . Edgington, 32, left, is accused of stabbing Sally Hodkin, 58, right, to death . Mr Morris can be heard saying: 'She's bloody killing her. Oh my God, she's f***ing killed her. For God's sake!' After giving the location to the operator he said: 'I've just witnessed a lady try to stab another lady with a knife... The girl was so lucky, the knife just missed her.' Miss Clark managed to grab the knife from Edgington during the attack at around 8.30am on 10 October 2011 and suffered only a cut to her palm. Mr Morris can then be heard following Edgington as she walked off up the road and entered a butcher's shop to grab another knife. He told the operator: 'You need to get someone here. She's walked out the shop. She's walking down the road now. I'm following her down the High Street.' Mr Morris is heard running after Edgington as she went round the corner into Albion Road near the bowling alley. Attack: Edgington is alleged to have grabbed the knife from Meat Market in Bexleyheath . He tells the operator: 'She's attacking another woman, she's stabbing another woman with a knife. 'I can't get there... she's stabbing another woman. She's bloody killing her! Oh my God, she's f***ing killed her. For God's sake! 'She's coming towards us. She's chasing a young schoolgirl now... she's lost the knife, she's lost the knife. 'Where are the police? She's gone into the tile centre. I need some help here!' The operator tells Mr Morris that they are on the way and shortly afterwards sirens are heard. He then tries to run back towards Mrs Hodkin, clearly out of breath, after seeing officers arrest Edgington. Mr Morris adds: 'The lady that's been stabbed is outside the bowling centre. You've got to get an ambulance. I can't run anymore.' Shocking scenes: She was then seen going around the corner and almost decapitating a grandmother, the court heard . He then ends the call after seeing more officers arrive. Edgington stabbed her mother to death in November 2005 and was detained under a hospital order after pleading guilty to manslaughter due to diminished responsibility. She was released into the community in 2009 and was staying at a flat in Greenwich, south London. Mrs Hodkin, who was married with two grown up sons, worked for law firm Cunningham Blake in nearby Blackheath as an accounts manager and was on her way to the office when she was killed.. Edgington admits carrying out the attacks but claims she did not intend to kill Miss Clark and that her responsibility for the death of Mrs Hodkin was diminished by her mental state. Edgington denies murder and attempted murder. The trial continues.

A Cleveland, Ohio, mother is fearing for her family's safety after the tap water in their home caught alight, causing a 'huge explosion.' Debby Kline was lighting a candle near the sink a few weeks ago when the water suddenly ignited, creating a fireball in the bathroom. 'Oh I was so scared. It just was a huge explosion, the entire sink up to the ceiling,' Kline told the Today show. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Scared: Ohio mother Debby Kline, pictured, is fearing for her family's safety after the tap water in their home caught alight . According to Today, the explosion occurred because the Kline's water, which comes from a local well, contains more than twice the safe level of highly-flammable methane gas. 'We're putting our kids in the bathtub every night in this explodable water,' Kline said. Methane is invisible and occurs naturally in the ground but can become dangerous when it seeps into water wells. When the ground is shaken up by anything from earthquakes to drilling the seepage gets even worse. According to Today, a natural gas company has been drilling at a site close by to the Kline's home. Before embarking on the drilling, the company, Mountaineer Keystone, paid the family to test their water. The results showed the methane levels were 9, which is just within safe limits. However, just months into the project, the methane levels had shot up to 22 — more than twice the acceptable level.

'This family in Ohio is not alone,' she said. 'There's been methane found in drinking water across the country.' Mall said laws need to be tougher to protect homeowners.

Mastermind: Daniel David Pawa reportedly hatched the plot to hawk more than 40 gallons of moonshine to undercover agents . A trio of Florida moonshine makers are in hot water for hawking more than 40 gallons of the potent alcoholic beverage to undercover cops - the second such 'shine' bust made in the Sunshine State in the last calendar year, alone. Daniel David Pawa was ensnared in a sting after a middle-man acting under his auspices reportedly replied in November to a phony Craigslist ad posted by authorities that was simply entitled, 'Moonshine?' The red herring was actually put on the website on Nov. 13 by Florida Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco agents in a bid to root out moonshine makers from the state, according to The Orlando Sentinel. It only took Pawa's intermediary a half-hour to reply to the post, which humorously requested that whoever had the 'strong stuff' should shoot the agents a text. 'Saw your ad on Craigslist looking for some shine,' the Pawa accomplice reportedly texted agents. Also arrested on Friday, according to the Sentinel, were accomplices Michael Ryan Inman, 25, and Amanda Marie Pouncey, 26. Pawa - for his part - is reportedly charged with operating a still from a house in the 200 block of East Palm Street in Lantana. He was arrested a day before, or Thursday. 'The danger in moonshine comes from the use of unregulated materials, which can lead to various threats to the consumers' health,' Sandi Copes Poreda, a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation, told The Sentinel. Pawa reportedly told the undercover agents he was not only a prolific moonshine maker, but a versatile one, as well. The Lantana man offered the agents the choice of a fruity-flavored moonshine, or a variety that boasted a sweet-tea taste. Strong Stuff: A giant moonshine still is confiscated by police after a raid on a downtown Pittsburgh business building during Prohibition . What's your pleasure: The Florida 'shine' makers offered cops their choice of a fruity-flavored concoction, one that tasted like sweet tea, or a pure flavor . Pawa reportedly also counted an unflavored, tongue-tingling 180 proof moonshine among his repertoire that would amount to 90 per cent alcohol by volume, or considerably stronger than the most potent spirit allowed under Florida law. The sting occurred Nov. 17 outside a West Palm Beach IHOP during which Inman and two others met with the undercover agents, who paid $150-a-gallon for the moonshine, The Sentinel wrote. Florida ABT agents arrested one other person in Florida on moonshine charges in the last 12 months, Poreda reportedly said. In November, agents in Fort Pierce arrested Jefferson Auvil on misdemeanor moonshine possession and illegal alcohol sale violations, Poreda told the Sentinel, adding that the man was found guilty in December.","Undercover agents posted a phony Internet ad simply asking, 'Who's got the strong stuff?'

George Zimmerman is facing trial for the murder of Trayvon Martin which has sparked outrage across America. He is currently in hiding . Former neighbourhood watch captain George Zimmerman plotted to escape unnoticed from prison in a rental vehicle whilst wearing concealed body armour. Zimmerman, who is accused of the murder of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, was to be picked up by an armed guard in a vehicle which had been scoured for secret GPS tracking devices. He would then be whisked from the Seminole County Jail, in Florida, to a tourist resort where he would go into the disabled toilet and change into a new shirt, hat and glasses, according to a recently-released 'jail escort plan'. Zimmerman, who is facing second-degree murder charges for the shooting, would then walk to a different vehicle and be driven to a safe house, according to the documents seen by the Orlando Sentinel. While he was being driven to his hiding place his bodyguards would watch for paparazzi, 'aerial' and 'negative counter surveillance' and for anyone wanting to attack their client. The plan was hatched by an Orlando private detective whose company, Associated Investigative Services Inc, last week filed a suit claiming they are owed $27,000 for security services. The civil complaint, which is also against Zimmerman's wife Shellie  and lawyer Mark O'Mara, claims Mr O'Mara hired the company in June to provide security for the family but the promised payments stopped after an independent trustee took over Zimmerman's defence fund. The company's invoices, attached to the suit, show that it billed  $66,000 for 21 days of protection – an average of more than $3,100 a day – even though Zimmerman was still in the Seminole County Jail during seven of those days, according to the Orlando Sentinel. During one five-day period, they charged more than $5,100 a day, the invoices show. Student Trayvon Martin, 17, was shot dead as he walked home from the shop. The killing has sparked rallies across America . Zimmerman's legal team claim he never signed a contract but lawyers for the security company say that they had an oral contract to carry out the difficult assignment of making a high-profile, widely-hated man invisible and safe. He is awaiting trial on second-degree murder charges in the shooting of Mr Martin. He says that the unarmed teenager attacked him whilst he was out on neighbourhood watch patrol and is claiming self-defense in the February killing - which ignited racial tensions and prompted rallies across America. Zimmerman, whose parents and lawyer also received hate mail and death threats, is currently free on $1 million bail and in hiding with his wife and bodyguard. It is said he mostly stays indoors where he is isolated and gaining weight. The couple are now paying $700 a week for protection, it is said. The bodyguards' lawsuit, filed Friday in state circuit court in Orange County, shows the lengths to which Zimmerman has gone to stay out of sight. On June 28, according to the suit, Mr O'Mara phoned Chris Rumbaugh, an Orlando private detective and former Orange County deputy, undercover drug agent and SWAT team member. Zimmerman was about to be released and needed to disappear with around-the-clock protection. Neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, left, leaves the Seminole County Jail after posting bail in Sanford, Florida .

The journal was found by a teacher, who turned it over to authorities. A search of Shrout's home found several small tobacco cans and two large cans, all with holes drilled in them and containing pellets, according to authorities. Taylor said all they needed were black powder and fuses to become explosives. The journal also allegedly mentioned using firearms. The sheriff said Shrout's father owned a few household weapons, such as a hunting rifle, a shotgun and a handgun. The sheriff said: 'He just talks about some students, he specifically named six students and one faculty member and he talked about weapons and the amounts of ammunition for each weapon that he would use if he attacked the school.' The sheriff said he didn't believe the teen's initial claim that the journal was a work of fiction. 'When you go to his house and you start . finding the actual devices that he talked about being made, no, it's not . fiction anymore,' Taylor said. 'Those devices were - all they needed . was the black powder and the fuse - he had put a lot of time and thought . into that.' Inspiration?

The teen, who is thin and wears glasses, said little during an initial court appearance on Monday. District Judge David Johnson set bond at $75,000 before the teen's family posted bond on Monday night and he was released. The judge ordered Shrout not to contact anyone at his school, students or teachers, and not to use the Internet without parental supervision. He also must wear an ankle monitoring device. His attorney, Jeremy Armstrong, declined to discuss specifics of the case, but he did say that the talk of the case he has heard so far was 'blown a little out of proportion'. 'Our position is that our client had no intention to harm anybody,' he said. Some of Shrout's classmates confirmed his interest in white supremacy. David Kelly, the senior class president, told WTVM-TV that he was Shrout's battalion commander in JROTC. 'At first through JROTC, he was confident, well-rounded, but as time went by, he was doing the whole white power thing,' Kelly told the station. Master race: Shrout is a self-proclaimed white supremacist as is believed to have learned bomb-making tacitcs from a neo-Nazi group . Another classmate, David White, said Shrout's involvement grew deeper in his short time at the school. 'I . saw that he was taking it more serious than anything, he started . getting real deep into it, and he had a little group of people doing it . with him. 'So, I thought it was getting to where I shouldn't be around . it, so I started not even hanging out with him for a long time,' White . said. Shrout detailed his terror plan in a journal . that was written just three days after the shooting massacre in Newtown, . Connecticut where gunman Adam Lanza killed 20 children and six teachers. The journal was spotted by a teacher at Russell County High School in Seale, Alabama, and he alerted police. Police found almost a dozen empty tobacco tins filled with shrapnel inside his bedroom .

A fanatical collector was yesterday convicted of stealing hundreds of birds eggs from the nests of protected species.

He spent two years wandering the countryside looking for nests to raid ‘because he liked the look of them’, magistrates were told. Among 548 illegally held eggs were those belonging to protected and endangered sparrowhawks, kestrels, owls and spoonbills. During questioning the HGV driver, from Huddersfield, spent four hours telling police about every egg. When police and RSPB officers entered his house on June 22 last year, they found many eggs with their contents deliberately blown out. Potter, 55, initially told police that all the eggs were old and legal. But he very quickly ‘fell on his sword’ and admitted some were obtained illegally from nests across northern England. Speaking after the case, Andy McWilliam, investigator for the UK National Wildlife Crime Unit, said: ‘He became a bit obsessed with eggs. 'He has only recently became involved with it. He got the bug and we think that he has only been taking from nests for the last two years. 'He had an old legal collection and has been adding to that. ‘He just wanted them to look nice.

With the severe winter cold season just beginning, doctors are advising as many people as possible to get immunized. It is particularly recommended for the very young, the very old and those with compromised immune systems. According to Google's search tracking, this is the worst flu season in more than six years . While 12 Chicago hospitals were on 'bypass status' and not taking patients, Cook County Hospital, pictured, remained open to flu sufferers . Carly Christenson, 14, is one of 20 children to have died already this winter from influenza . With three more months to go, this flu season  is already one of the worst in 10 years, according to experts. 'In the past 10 years we have seen just two or three . like it,' said Tom Skinner of the federal Centers for Disease Control . and Prevention. One of the most impacted areas is Boston, where Mayor Tom Menino has declared a public health emergency because . there are at least 700 flu victims in the city, compared to 70 all of . last winter. The . Massachusetts Department of Public Health said it has seen 18 . flu-related deaths in the state this winter, four in Boston, and . described cases of the virus as severe. Health care centers across the city are offering free vaccines to anyone who hasn’t yet been immunized. 'This is the worst flu season we've seen since 2009, and people should take the threat of flu seriously,' Menino said in a statement. 'This is not only a health concern, but also an economic concern for families, and I'm urging residents to get vaccinated if they haven't already.' Menino also urged people to stay home from work or school if they are sick. Baystate Health, which operates Baystate Medical Center in Springfield and two other hospitals in western Massachusetts, announced Wednesday that it was changing its visitor policy. The hospitals are no longer allowing visitors younger than 14 and are recommending no more than two people visit a patient at one time. 'This is the worst in several years,' said Dr. Sarah Haessler, an infectious disease specialist at Baystate.

A former DEA agent is spilling the details of his missions as an undercover cartel boss and drug trafficker - and warns that the drug cartels may never be stopped on either side of the border. Celerino Castillo III, an American-born Vietnam veteran and former DEA agent, spoke out in a recent interview about his involvement in the 1980s-era war on drugs. After several years as a police detective, Castillo became a DEA agent in 1979, and was sent to the jungles of Peru, where he operated search and destroy missions. He was later forced out of the country after a hit was put out on him. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Celerino Castillo III operated in search and destroy missions in Peru, Guatemala and El Salvador in the 1980s . Going undercover: Castillo worked with other DEA agents and informants to infiltrate the drug cartels . But instead of returning to the U.S., he . reported to El Salvador and Guatemala, where he aided anti-narcoterrism . units, undercover operations, run raids and search-and-destroy . missions. Castillo told Vice: 'I played different parts, I played being a Mexican, drug trafficker buying large quanities of cocaine. We were infiltrating drug cartels with informants. Introduced to different members of the cartels. At that time period, you actually knew who they were.' When he worked with authorities in Mexico, Castillo was struck by their use of excessive force. He told Vice that Mexican authorities would hang suspects upside down and splash water above their noses, creating a waterboarding-like effect. He said they also used cattle prods. Agent: Sometimes Castillo posed as a drug trafficker, often handling bales of cocaine . He said: 'Mexican authorities were known to do the most outrageous things you could think of. [It was] my first case of torturing people. 'I couldn’t understand it, but they said, ""This is what we do in Mexico and this is what we’ll continue to do... You guys aren't going to come in here and tell us how to do it.""' Today, Castillo says the cartels remain a juggernaut on the U.S.-Mexico border - and believes that they'll remain as long as their wallets stay fat. War on drugs: Castillo says that the cartels remain a juggernaut on the U.S.-Mexico border - and believes that they'll remain as long as their wallets stay fat . He told Vice: I don't think drug trafficking will ever stop. It’s become too big of a monster. We've created a beast and it’s going to be very difficult. The cartels have controlled both sides of the border because they have the money to do it. On Tuesday, Border Patrol agent Nicholas Ivie became the latest casualty of the war on drugs when he was shot to death in Arizona, the first fatal shooting of an agent since 2010. Victim: Border patrol agent Nicolas Ivie, 30, was identified as the agent who was killed during the shootout early Tuesday morning . Ivie, 30, and a colleague were on patrol in the desert near Naco, Arizona, about 100 miles from Tucson, when shooting broke out shortly before 2am, the Border Patrol said. The second agent was shot in the ankle and buttocks, and was airlifted to a hospital. Authorities have not identified the agent who was wounded, nor did they say whether any weapons were seized at the site of the shooting. Mr Ivie is survived by a wife and two children. No arrests have been made in the shooting. Investigators suspect that more that just one person fired at the agents. 'It was basically an ambush,' said Cochise County Sheriff's Office commander Marc Denney. 'They had a little bit of a jump on . us. It is very rocky terrain. We're hoping that they hunkered down . somewhere close by so that we have an opportunity to find them.' The sheriff's office, the DEA and the FBI, which are both investigating the . shooting, declined to say whether investigators have recovered guns or . bullet casings at the scene of the shooting. Authorities set up a checkpoint on a . dirt road about seven miles southeast of Bisbee. The Tuscon Sentinel . cites a reporter from Fronteras Desk who claimed that two suspects have . been detained in Mexico though their identities were not been released. Searching: Agents continued to search for clues and the suspects well into Tuesday after the early morning shooting . Coordination: Agents from multiple government agencies are working together on the search, and the area of the shooting is used frequently by drug traffickers . The . area near the shooting is scattered with houses, trailers and . ranchettes. Mesquite trees and creosote bushes dotted the landscape, and . a mountain range stands nearby to the west. The U.S. government has put thousands . of sensors along the border that, when tripped, alert dispatchers that . they should send agents to a particular location. 'It’s a very rough area — it’s . mountainous, rocky, loose rock, low vegetation,' Cochise county . sheriff's commander Marc Denney told The Los Angeles Times. 'It’s . hard terrain to maneuver around. There’s not a lot of trail systems in . place. You’re just trying to work your way around and not turn an . ankle.' Reeling: This is the first fatal shooting of a border patrol agent since 2010, as the only other deaths have due to car accidents . The . agents were fired upon in a rugged hilly area about five miles north of . the border as they responded to an alarm that was triggered on one of . the sensors, said sheriff's spokeswoman Carol Capas. It is not known whether the agents returned fire, Capas said. The wounded agent is in stable . condition and should be released from the hospital later Tuesday, said . George McCubbin, president of the National Border Patrol Council, a . union representing about 17,000 border patrol agents. The agents who . were shot were on patrol with a third agent, who was not harmed, . Mr McCubbin said. The Border Patrol said Ivie worked for the agency since January 2008 and grew up in Provo, Utah. Warning: The agents were fired upon in a rugged hilly area about five miles north of the border as they responded to an alarm that was triggered on one of the sensors installed to alert possible breaches . The last Border Patrol agent fatally . shot on duty was Brian Terry, who died in a shootout with bandits near . the border in December 2010. The Border Patrol station in Naco, where . the two agents shot Tuesday were stationed, was recently named after . Terry. Terry's shooting was . later linked to the government's Fast and Furious gun-smuggling . operation, which allowed people suspected of illegally buying guns for . others to walk away from gun shops with weapons, rather than be . arrested. Prior to Tuesday's attack, the most recent fatality was Leopoldo Cavazos Jr. who died on July 6 due to injuries from an ATV accident near Fort Hancock, Texas.James Dominguez was killed on July 19 when he was killed by a passing vehicle while helping stranded motorists in Cline, Texas.Both Hector Clark and his partner agent Eduardo Rojas Jr. were killed when their patrol car was hit by a freight train near Gila Bend, Arizona.The case that has drawn the most publicity in recent years was that of agent Brian Terry, . whose shooting death on December 15, 2010, during a sting operation . shed light on the government's 'Fast and Furious' plan to track gun . trafficking between the U.S.-Mexico border. Authorities intended to track the guns into Mexico. Two rifles found at the scene of Terry's shooting were bought by a member of the gun-smuggling ring being investigated. Critics of the operation say any shooting along the border now will raise the specter those illegal weapons are still being used in border violence. 'There's no way to know at this point how the agent was killed, but because of Operation Fast and Furious, we'll wonder for years if the guns used in any killing along the border were part of an ill-advised gun-walking strategy,' Republican Senator Chuck Grassley said in a written statement. The Terry family said that the . shooting was a 'graphic reminder of the inherent dangers that threaten . the safety of those who live and work near the border.' Twenty-six Border Patrol agents have died in the line of duty since 2002. Bisbee-area . residents expressed a mix of concern and frustration about the . shooting, along with recognition that the border can be a dangerous . place. The region has seen . its share of violence in recent years, including the Terry shooting and . the slaying of a well-known rancher in 2010. That killing is, in part, . credited with pushing Arizona lawmakers to pass a law that requires . officers, when they stop someone, to check the immigration status of . those they suspect are in the country illegally. 'There is no security on the border - none,' said Edward L. Thomas, who owns rental properties in Bisbee.

An electronic voting machine in Pennsylvania has been removed from service after it changed votes for President Obama into those for Mitt Romney. An 18-second clip posted onto YouTube shows a voter's finger repeatedly pressing the button for Obama, but the check mark instead comes up next to Romney's name. This is the latest in a flurry of voting glitches across the country today from West Palm Beach in Florida where ballot counting machines broke down, to vast swathes of New Jersey where text alert systems for residents sent them to the wrong polling stations. Scroll Down for Video . The YouTube video clearly shows the voter's finger touching the screen to vote for Barack Obama (left) but lighting up for Mitt Romney instead (right) In comments attached to the clip, . the anonymous user named 'centralpavote' said that 'all the other . buttons worked fine' and asked voters either side if they were . experiencing similar problems - which they denied. NBC News has reported that since the clip was posted to Reddit this morning, it spread across the Internet and the offending machine has been retired from service. The video which was filmed on the YouTube users Android phone shows the potentially serious malfunction affect only a vote for the incumbent president. A vote for any other of the candidates for the presidency and vice presidency resulted in a successful choice - it was only a vote for President Obama that caused the machine to change to Mitt Romney. 'I initially selected Obama but Romney was highlighted,' said 'centralpavote' on the introduction to his video on YouTube. Christie Tipton casts her ballot using an electronic voting machine similar to the one in Pennsylvania that refused to cast a vote for Barack Obama . A school in Philadelphia has been asked to cover up a mural of Barack Obama that was on display in front of voters today . They were criticised for only using three pieces of paper to cover the mural - leading to accusations of bias from Republicans . 'I assumed it was being picky so I deselected Romney and tried Obama again, this time more carefully, and still got Romney. 'Being a software developer, I immediately went into troubleshoot mode. 'I first thought the calibration was off and tried selecting Jill Stein to actually highlight Obama. Nope. Jill Stein was selected just fine. 'Next I deselected her and started at the top of Romney’s name and started tapping very closely together to find the ‘active areas’. 'From the top of Romney’s button down to the bottom of the black checkbox beside Obama’s name was all active for Romney. 'From the bottom of that same checkbox to the bottom of the Obama button (basically a small white sliver) is what let me choose Obama. 'Stein’s button was fine. All other buttons worked fine.' The voter reported the problem to an electoral official who declared it a non issue. 'I then called over a volunteer to have a look at it,' said 'centralpavote'/ . 'She . him hawed (sic) for a bit then calmly said 'It’s nothing to worry . about, everything will be OK.' and went back to what she was doing. 'I then recorded this video.' However, . far from evidence of electoral fraud, experts have weighed in with the . theory that this is a calibration problem specific to the machine. 'It's a concern but not because of . fraud... that's an obviously miscalibrated iVotronic (ES&S) voting . machine,' said Jospeh Lorenzo Hall, Senior Staff Technologist at the . Center for Democracy & Technology to Gawker. 'We would recommend that poll workers would recalibrate the machine and everything would be fine. Bob Warhola casts his vote at a polling place inside a residential garage, Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2012, in Forest City, Pennsylvania . 'Also, with some models of voting system if you place a thumb on accident while resting on the machine it can 'bias' the calibration of the touchscreen up towards the errant thumb. 'That could be happening to, if it's only for this one voter.' Further controversy over voting . continued at a polling place in a Philadelphia school where workers . ignored a judge's order to cover a mural of President Obama 'in its . entirety'. The art work . which is positioned behind voting machines contains the words 'change!' and 'hope' together with a quote from the president and a painting of . him. However, electoral . poll workers only covered up the mural with three pieces of paper - . leaving the Obama logo and quote from the serving president in full view . of all prospective voters. Seeing an attempt to influence the votes of those attending the polling place in Ward 35, Republicans were outraged. A poll worker assists a voter with the voting booth curtain before voting during the U.S. presidential election at the Penrose recreation center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania today . 'It . is an absolute disgrace,' said Shannon Royer, deputy secretary for . external affairs and elections in Pennsylvania to Fox News. 'Election . materials and electioneering inside the polling place are prohibited by . state law. This can be interpreted as trying to influence voters inside . the polling place. 'I am told discussions are going on now about covering the mural.' However, even though the voting machine whistle-blower . has kept their anonymity, other better known individuals are unwittingly . breaking the law by posting pictures from the ballot box online. Talk show host Sean Hannity didn't surprise anyone with the contents of his ballot when he tweeted a photo of it. What may be a surprise is that very act appeared to break the law. The ballot that the Fox News Channel host tweeted showed him voting for Mitt Romney on the Conservative Party line, and continuing to vote for Conservatives across the undercard. Yet New York State law says that it's illegal for someone to reveal the contents of a prepared ballot, perhaps a pre-social media era statute designed to guard against voter intimidation. It's a misdemeanor that would be up to a district attorney to prosecute, said John Conklin, spokesman for the New York State Board of Elections. Fox News host Sean Hannity apparently tweeted pictures of his ballot today. This may be a misdemeanor under New York State elections law which prohibits voters from showing a ballot after it is prepared for voting . Voters cast their votes using electronic voting machines during the U.S. presidential election at a voting location in Valley City, Ohio today . The idea of showing off a completed ballot on Twitter, Instagram or some other social media site wasn't considered by the Founding Fathers. But it was a hot topic for discussion online early Tuesday, and the website gizmodo.com published a guide of how individual state laws might affect such an act. In fact according to new data from Pew Research 22 percent of registered voters in the United States have indicated on Facebook or Twitter who they voted for today. However, the question of whether using your smartphone to photograph your ballot is illegal depends entirely on the state in which you are voting. Some states such as Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Michigan, Nevada and Texas, 'expressly prohibit the use of photographic and recording equipment inside polling places.' The state of Wisconsin is cracking down hard on those who post completed ballot pics to Facebook or Twitter - explaining that it constitutes election fraud under that state's law and is a Class I felony.

Dozens of Indian Jews who claim to be the descendants of a lost biblical Jewish tribe emigrated to Israel from their village in India on Monday, celebrating their arrival after a five-year struggle to get in. The Bnei Menashe, from the northeastern part of India, say they are descended from Jews banished from ancient Israel to India in the eighth century B.C. An Israeli chief rabbi recognised them as one of the 10 'lost tribes' in 2005, and about 1,700 moved to Israel over the next two years before the government stopped giving them visas. Overjoyed: Immigrants from the Bnei Menashe tribe of the Jewish community in Manipur, northeast India, reunite with their family members at Ben Gurion airport near Tel Aviv on Monday . New life: Fifty members of Bnei Menashe arrived this week to join the 1,700 already resident in Israel . Emotional: Friends and relatives who were forced apart tearfully embrace, while others prepare to build a life alone or with just their immediate family . Hopeful: No genetic studies have yet proved ancestry for the Bnei Menash, who claim they were exiled in the eighth century BC . 'Dream': Family members greet relatives, with a further 7,200 Bnei Menashe waiting to join them from in the Indian states of Mizoram and Manipur . Arguments: Members of the tribe are eligible to emigrate if they convert, although the Indian authorities have resisted the process . Israel recently reversed that policy, agreeing to let the remaining 7,200 Bnei Menashe immigrate. Fifty-three arrived in Tel Aviv on a flight Monday. Michael Freund, an Israel-based activist on their behalf, said nearly 300 others will arrive in the coming weeks. 'This is a very moving aliyah,' he told ynetnews.com. 'We feel like our lost brothers have come home.' The Bnei Menashe (sons of Manasseh) claim descent from one of the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel, who were sent into exile by the Assyrian Empire (above) more than 27 centuries ago. Their ancestors wandered through Central Asia and the Far East for centuries, before settling in what is now northeastern India, along the border with Burma and Bangladesh. The Bnei Menashe practise Judaism, observing the Sabbath, keeping kosher, celebrating the festivals and following family laws. An Israeli chief rabbi recognised them as one of the 10 'lost tribes' in 2005, and about 1,700 moved to Israel over the next two years, helped by Israel-based organisation Shavei, before the government stopped giving them visas. Another 7,200 remain in India, hoping to move, and Israel recently agreed they too would be allowed to immigrate, provided they convert first. India, however, does not support the policy, which may trigger a mass exodus. Some do not believe the tribe qualify as Jews, however, claiming that they simply want to escape poverty in India. Avraham Poraz, a former interior minister, said they were not linked to the Jewish people and claimed Israeli settlers were using them to strengthen Israel's claims to the West Bank. Several genetic studies have been undertaken, but none has yet proved ancestry, according to author Nadia Abu El-Haj. Freund, who joined the flight from India, said that during the trip 'we all had tears of joy in our eyes, realising that this is part of the closure of a 2,700-year historical circle of this lost tribe.' Freund stressed that 'their immigration to Israel demonstrates the power and determination of the Jewish faith: Despite being cut off for hundreds and thousands of years, they never forgot who they were and where they want to return to.' Lhing Lenchonz, 26, arrived in Israel with her husband and eight-month-old daughter. 'After waiting for thousands of years, our dream came true,' she said. 'We are now in our land.' Ben Asher, 23, who arrived with his family, added: 'Israel is my heritage and religion. Israel is everything to me. We are very happy. We've been waiting for this moment for hundreds of years.' He plans to join the Israel Defense Forces soon. 'I want to serve my country in any way possible,' he added. Zimra Danapa, 20, flew to Israel with her mother and sister. 'I have fulfilled my dream,' she said. 'After many years of hoping to arrive in Israel, I am very excited to be here. 'We plan to build our life here and bring more family members here.' Zvi Kalfa, a community member who immigrated to Israel 13 years ago, leaving his parents behind, said: 'At the airport there was an exciting reunion. Some of the immigrants united with their relatives who have already been here for years. 'Our hope is to bring everyone here.' But not all Israelis think Bnei Menashe qualify as Jews, and some suspect they are simply fleeing poverty in India. Avraham Poraz, a former interior minister, said they were not linked to the Jewish people. He also charged that Israeli settlers were using them to strengthen Israel's claims to the West Bank. When Chief Rabbi Shlomo Amar recognized the Bnei Menashe as a lost tribe in 2005, he insisted they undergo conversion to be recognised as Jews. He sent a rabbinical team to India that converted 218 Bnei Menashe, until Indian authorities stepped in and stopped it. Faith: The Bnei Menashe practise Judaism, observing the Sabbath, keeping kosher, celebrating the festivals and following family laws . A former Israeli interior minister, said that Israeli settlers were using the Bnei Menashe to strengthen Israel's claims to the disputed West Bank . The Bnei Menashe come from the states of Mizoram and Manipur near India's border with Myanmar, where, they say, their ancestors landed after the Assyrians banished them. Over the centuries they became animists, and in the 19th century, British missionaries converted many to Christianity. Even so, the group says they continued to practise ancient Jewish rituals, including animal sacrifices, which they say were passed down from generation to generation. Jews in the Holy Land stopped animal sacrifices after the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem in 70 A.D.","Villagers from northeastern India will be allowed to settle in Israel .

The grandson of a statesman seen as the architect of the EU has warned that 'Europe will fail' if debt-stricken countries are forced to stick with the euro. Stephan Werhahn quit the Christian Democratic Union, which was founded by his grandfather Konrad Adenauer, to switch to a eurosceptic party. The German financial consultant plans to stand as a candidate for the Free Voters (Freie Wahlen) because he believes Greece should not be propped up with loans from his country. Mr Werhahn, 59, said Chancellor Angela Merkel's zealous backing for the euro was 'not in the tradition of my grandfather'. Dissenting voice: German Stephan Werhahn said he does not believe his country should prop up others with bailout loans . Konrad Adenauer, left, speaks to German President Theodor Heuss in 1956. Playing between them is the young Mr Werharn, son of Adenauer's daughter Libet. The euro should be limited to a handful of similar northern European countries, argued Mr Werhahn, letting other states leave it and re-boot their economies. He claimed that Mrs Merkel was 'levelling everyone like a steamroller', according to The Times. The Free Voters only have about 10 per cent of the vote in Bavaria but are planning a nationwide campaign in September's federal elections. However, Mrs Merkel is seen as determined to impose economic discipline on Greece in return for bailout loans, and is expected to win a third term as Chancellor next year on the back of this plan. Mr Werhahn is one of few eurosceptic politicians in Germany, with the biggest parties supporting the 17-nation eurozone. Now, he and a growing number of economists have warned that if a second write-off of Greek debts became necessary, it would cost German taxpayers dear and deepen animosities in Europe. Euro 2012: Mr Werhahn said Angela Merkel, left, was not 'following in the tradition of his grandfather' Konrad Adenauer, right, Germany's first post-war Chancellor . Mr Werhahn said the euro had created such economic tensions in the system that it had led to riots, adding: 'If you want to be pro-Europe, you have to make sure that the citizens of Europe are happy and not that the central institutions are happy. 'As a CDU man and Adenauer’s grandson, I had serious concerns that this cannot go on like this, that Europe will fail if the euro is forced upon these countries instead of letting them go. 'Do we want to pour money into the poor uncompetitive countries or to find some other way, for example by letting them have their currency?' He even said the currency’s troubles were increasing tensions between member states, with some Greeks harking back to when the country was occupied by Germany during the Second World War and comparing the situation to 'the Fourth Reich'.","Stephan Werhahn has quit the pro-euro Christian Democratic Union .

The president of a group planning to build a fortress city in Western Idaho, in which all citizens aged 13 and up will be armed with rifles, has posted pictures of the group's gun factory online. James Miller says the moment has come for his movement which is ‘ready to stand on the green and defend liberty' inspired by Captain John Parker, who commanded the Lexington militia. News of the scheme dubbed ‘the Citadel’ emerged yesterday with its website claiming hundreds of families had already signed up to the ‘patriotic’ community. Home-made: Weapons made by the III Arms Company will be sold to fund the Citadel according to its website. Pictures of the process have been put on Facebook . Gun-maker: James Miller, President of the III Arms Company, says the time was right for a citadel, right. The project claims to own 200 acres in Western Idaho from which they hope to develop their fortress city, left . The group say they plan to create a town of 3,500 to 7,000 families supported with an arms factory run by the III Arms Company at the Citadel’s core providing income for the society through sales and also arming residents aged 13 and over to become the city’s ‘security force’. ' ‘Those who consider us insane [do so] only because they don’t hear what the III Arms calling is doing and the Citadel has for us,’ Miller the president of the III Arms Company told a meeting to promote the movement. ‘It is up to us to make them hear that call to bring them aboard and make them one of us.’ III Arms Company's Facebook site contains numerous photographs of the group's cache of home-made guns including assault weapons, which they are selling for more than $1000 a go, and calls to oppose gun control in the wake of the Sandy Hook massacre. Arms preparations: Images of a small-scale weapons factory were placed on the III Arms Company's Facebook account. They want to fund an American citadel with the weapons they make . Miller, who is president of The III Arms Company and a key supporter of the Citadel, was filmed speaking at a 'Patcon' meeting last year when plans were first coming together for the armed city. The Citadel has so far purchased 20 acres of land in Benewah County, Idaho, which its website says will ‘become the initial factory location for our firearms company and will be developed into a Showcase for the larger Citadel concept.’ They say the mountainous area is their first choice for the completed project. Plans for the final city show a perimeter wall to the community complete with 18 look-out towers, a firearms museum, a reflecting pool, a school and an amphitheatre. III Arms Company is currently selling homemade AR-15s and 1911 pistols although point out legislation on gun control following the Sandy Hook massacre may block the sale of assault rifles in the future. Promotion: The III Arms Company sells two types of guns, an assault rife and a pistol . ‘Face it folks. The market changed overnight Tuesday,’ the website reads. ‘The ability to purchase an AR at yesterday's costs is rapidly coming to a quick and painful ending. The timer started ticking Tuesday. It's a countdown timer and we're rapidly approaching 00:00:00. In the firearms world, when that timer hits 00:00:00 this time...it does not reset like it did in 2004.’ The group say the community will live in accordance with Thomas Jefferson's ideal of rightful liberty and prepare for all imagined emergencies. ‘It will be defined by physical preparedness to survive and prevail in the face of natural catastrophes --such as Hurricanes Sandy or Katrina -- or man-made catastrophes such as a power grid failure or economic collapse,’ the website says. Miller adds: ‘I think we are all ready for something like this to succeed and honestly the moment for making something like this to happen is right now.’ Fortress: Plans for the Citadel include two perimeter walls with 18 watchtowers and further . walled sections for residential areas . Site: The proposed location for the Citadel is in Benwah County, Idaho where the group have already purchased 20 acres .

Retailers have been accused of craftily overplaying discount claims to draw shoppers in to post Christmas sales. Boxing Day saw a record sales high for high street shops and online retailers with many offering discounts of between 50 and 70 per cent. But a survey of half price sales has found many had been much less generous than their claims had suggested. Retailers have been accused of craftily overplaying discount claims to draw shoppers in . Boxing Day saw a record sales high for high street shops and online retailers with many offering discounts of between 50 and 70 per cent, but many had been much less generous than their claims . The Sunday Times conducted a survey between Boxing Day and December 27, analysing sales at some of the country's leading retailers including John Lewis, Marks & Spencer, Debenhams, and House of Fraser. It found that in many sales categories - including shoes, bags and dresses - less than half were available at the headline discount. Christine Cross, chief retail adviser to accountancy firm PwC told the paper retailers were being very clever, by 'shouting about discounts' more than they were discounting. She said: 'They're saying ""up to 50 per cent off "" but it is very much ""up to"" rather than ""50 per cent off"". It is the first time it has been marked as this because retailers are trying to win market share amid thin sales.' David McCorquodale, head of retail at the professional services firm KPMG, said while retailers wanted to attract customers, they had to cover costs. And Clare Francis of comparison website Moneysupermarket said shoppers should be careful not to get drawn in to headline discounts without researching to ensure they were getting the best deal. In the 'biggest ever half price sale' at Debenhams, just 21 of 121 pairs of shoes - 17 per cent - were discounted, and just 25 per cent of bags. The M & S sale offered discounts of up to 50 per cent both online and instore. But the survey revealed only 20 of 126 shoes were cut by 50 per cent or more, and just 27 per cent of bags and 46 per cent of dresses were half price. At John Lewis, which also advertised up to 50 per cent off, there were more items at 30 per cent off. But Next generally offered at least 50 per cent off all the items in the categories and House of Fraser also had more than half of items at the headline discount. All retailers have insisted they complied with advertising rules and made it clear 50 per cent discounts applied only to selected items. Christmas spending got off to a slow start in early December, but trading improved in the latter part of the month. But this year has seen the shortest ever post Christmas sales. Tomorrow is expected to see just half the high number of shoppers recorded on Thursday, as stock levels fall. British Retail Consortium spokesman Richard Dodd said: 'Weekly sales figures drop very dramatically after Christmas, with a quick tail-off. By January, retail spend is half what it is in December. 'The relentless no-growth sales environment means big difficulties for retailers and there are no signs that will change.' Ipsos president Peter Luff said: 'Retailers have significantly cut back on stock. We expect there to have been quite a drop in footfall from Saturday.' Professor Joshua Bamfield, director of the Centre for Retail Research, said: 'We don’t think Christmas sales have ever tailed off this quickly. Post-Christmas sales first happened in the pre-War years and lasted through January, before moving to late December in the late 1990s. 'This year, we have sales starting on Christmas Eve and tailing off days after Christmas - with key indicators including the greater availability of parking spaces this year compared to previous years. 'High sales occurred immediately post-Christmas - but these were concentrated in a shorter period than usual. The survey found at John Lewis, which also advertised up to 50 per cent off, there were more items at 30 per cent off . 'In previous years, customers have been enticed to keep on spending money. But this year, customers have spent the money they had in mind and they’re not keeping on spending. 'Sales are falling away and, from what retailers have told us, footfall is expected to be down 50 per cent between December 27 and 31. New Year’s Eve may be quite dead. 'Sales were initially high in big cities but only good in smaller cities. The retail industry has been saying ‘it’s great, it’s fantastic’ - but it will be a different story when they add up the figures in January. 'We expect a fall in retail sales totals to mid-January compared to last year.' The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) say to substantiate a 50 per cent sale claim, at least 10 per cent of discounted products must have the discount. Marks & Spencer said all reductions were 'clearly marked' on each product, and Debenhams said it 'far exceeded' the requirement, with some items reduced by 70 per cent. John Lewis said there were 'roughly the same' number of 50 per cent and 30 per cent discounts.","Study reveals less than half of sale items were available at the headline discount at shops surveyed .

He has left money in his will to help restore the tower . A unique wartime control tower where classic film The First of the Few was filmed has been saved from ruin thanks to the legacy of a Spitfire pilot. More than 70 years after the movie starring David Niven and Leslie Howard was recorded at RAF Ibsley the dilapidated concrete building is to be restored to its former glory after wartime pilot Des Smith left thousands dedicated to the cause in his will. Then Prime Minister Winston . Churchill gave his permission for Ibsley to be used for the biopic which chronicles the true story of how two of the most remarkable men in aviation history - visionary Spitfire designer RJ Mitchell and his test pilot Geoffrey Crisp - designed a streamlined monoplane that led to the development of the Spitfire. But the film was shot while the tower was in use and work was constantly interrupted when real Spitfire . pilots had to scramble . But it was thanks to this that Howard was able to recreate scenes from the Battle of Britain from the first hand accounts of Squadrons 501 and 118 - which fought in the 1940 battle - and were based there. Some of the RAF pilots were even given small parts in the movie. Ironically, the base was just a few miles from the one-time home of Nazi propagandist the traitor William Joyce, nicknamed Lord Haw-Haw. He moved from the area in 1937 shortly before he left for Germany and began his notorious radio broadcasts. The RAF Ibsley Airfield Heritage Trust . has now secured a lease for the air base in Hampshire's New Forest and now . hope to preserve it forever by turning it into a museum using some of the money left in Fl Lt Smith's will. Before he died in 2010 aged in his late 80s, Fl Lt Smith recalled his time at Ibsley, which is near the town of Ringwood. Des Smith, pictured in 2010 back in the Ibsley control tower he fought to save for the nation, and where classic film The First of the Few was filmed . More than 70 years after the movie starring David Niven and Leslie Howard was recorded at RAF Ibsley the dilapidated concrete building is to be brought back to life . He said: 'I was posted to Ibsley just a few weeks after they finished filming The First of the Few in early 1942. 'There were three squadrons based there including 501, which was the one I was in. 'I . remember flying in and out of the New Forest during the war and I've . always lived locally so I've watched as the tower has become neglected. 'It . all looks a bit different now because gravel has been extracted from . the ground and that process has left lakes near the old air base.

A Spitfire pictured at RAF Iblsey, where three squadrons were based during World War Two . 'It is the only tower in the forest that it is possible to restore and we just hope that we can get it done. The Battle of Britain was the German air force's attempt to gain air superiority over the RAF from July to September 1940. It was one of the turning points of World War Two and prevented Germany from invading Britain. The battle began in mid-July with Luftwaffe concentrating on attacking shipping in the English Channel and attacking coastal towns and defences. From 12 August, Hermann Goering, one of the leaders of the Nazi regime, shifted his focus to the destruction of the RAF, attacking the many airfields and radar bases which had sprung up across the country during the war. Convinced that Fighter Command was now close to defeat, he also tried to force air battles between fighter planes to break British strength. However, Goering grew frustrated by the large number of British planes that were still fighting off his attacks. Luftwaffe switched tactics again and, on Hitler's orders, set about destroying London and other major cities. Eleven days later, on what became 'Battle of Britain Day', the RAF decimated the huge incoming Luftwaffe formations in the skies above London and the south coast. The tower, a so called type 518/40 'Watch Office with Meteorological Section' base, is similar . to about 50 others that were built for World War II but it was the only one . with concrete floors and balcony. The trust will now start . weatherproofing and carrying out structural surveys of the building in . the next few months, followed by refurbishment plans and a major . fund-raising campaign. The news has delighted Shirley Simmonds, president of the Ibsley Historical Group that has been campaigning for many years for the building to be saved. The widow of Battle of Britain pilot Flight Lieutenant Vernon Simmonds, who was also a driver at Ibsley in the war, said: 'At last it finally feels like something is happening. 'I'm absolutely delighted that this building will be given a new and useful purpose, telling future generations the story of RAF Ibsley, its squadrons and the many thousands of personnel that served there.' Roly Errington, chairman of the RAF Ibsley Airfield Heritage Trust, said: 'It is the last chance saloon for this building and if it gets much more damaged by rain it will be beyond saving. 'It is a unique building and was the first base that the Americans took over and was the place where they flew their first sorties from. 'To make it succeed it has to be about more than just rescuing a unique building from dereliction, we must also give it a sustainable future. 'We want to create somewhere for people to come and find out about RAF Ibsley and show them how a World War Two airfield would have operated. 'We intend to tell the stories of the people that lived around the airfield, and the impact it had on their lives. 'We want to restore the building as a tribute, from our generation, to the service personnel from Great Britain and around the world that served at Ibsley and, in particular, to those that lost their lives while stationed here.' 501 Spitfire squadron at RAF Ibsley in 1942.

Now Beryl Renwick, 86, and Betty Smith, . 91, who with a combined age of 176 were a surprise hit at this year's prestigious Sony Radio Awards, are getting ready to hang up their mikes at  BBC Radio Humberside. The end of an era: Beryl Renwick (right), 86, and Betty Smith, 91 (left) will hang up their mikes on Christmas Day after six years broadcasting together . The ladies met at the Ritz afternoon club in Hull in 1999 after their husbands died and soon became firm friends. Their radio show did not start until seven years later - in 2006 - when they and 15 other members of their ladies’ Tuesday Club social group went on a tour of the BBC Radio Humberside offices. Producer David Reeves was looking for a new format for a show and was instantly charmed by the pair. He said: ‘They were just very cheeky. They kept asking for records - first they wanted Frank Sinatra, then Queen, then classical music. 'Then they started telling me I was good looking and ruffling my hair and giving me a squeeze.

The pair said they were more surprised than anyone to receive the . award ahead of a shortlist of talent including comedian Frank Skinner and BBC's Adam and Joe.

The leaders of three of England's biggest cities have warned government cuts will lead to the 'break up of civil society' with chaos on the streets . Council leaders of Newcastle, Liverpool and Sheffield,  where Nick Clegg . is an MP, called for the government to halt cuts that they say . unfairly penalise the north over the south, before 'crime and . community tensions erupt'. There are also signs of a backlash from rural authorities, mostly Conservative-led, who claim that the shires are losing out disproportionately under the Government's cuts. The leaders of three of England's biggest cities have warned government cuts will lead to chaos on the streets, such as that seen in London during the riots of 2011 . David Cameron and George Osborne announced in the Autumn Statement that councils must find a further 2 per cent of savings in 2014/15, on top of the 27 per cent cuts announced in 2010. The Labour leaders of Newcastle, Liverpool and Sheffield - where Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg is an MP - wrote to The Observer accusing Whitehall of 'Dickensian' views. 'Rising crime, increasing community tension and more problems on our streets will contribute to the break-up of civil society if we do not turn back' they write. 'The one nation Tory brand of conservatism recognised the duty of government to help the country's most deprived in the belief that economic and social responsibility benefited us all. 'The unfairness of the Government's cuts is in danger of creating a deeply divided nation. We urge them to stop what they are doing now and listen to our warnings before the forces of social unrest start to smoulder.' Separately, The Sunday Telegraph reported that more than 120 rural councils were weighing up a judicial review of the spending settlement for local authorities because it was 'grossly unfair' and would hit services in remote areas. George Osborne announced in the Autumn Statement that councils must find a further 2 per cent of savings in 2014/15 . Roger Begy, leader of Conservative-controlled Rutland Council and chairman of a new campaign called 'Sparse', said: 'Rural authorities for the last 10 to 12 years have been seriously under funded in relation to urban areas. 'For the last 18 months we have been working with the Government reviewing the (spending) formula that takes into account deprivation. Now that has been ignored completely and all the promises ministers made have disappeared. We are going to have to do something. 'This is totally unfair and is going to crucify a lot of rural areas. People are going to be isolated.' Communities Secretary Eric Pickles prompted warnings of further reductions in services when he announced this month that English councils would have their spending power reduced by 1.7 per cent next year. Mr Pickles claimed the settlement represented a 'bargain' for local authorities, adding that the Government would offer support for the third year so that council taxes could be frozen. A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said: 'Councils must keep doing their bit to tackle the inherited budget deficit because they account for a quarter of all public spending and still get through over £114 billion of taxpayers money each year. 'The local government settlement is a fair deal arming councils with an average spending power of £2,240 per household. It is fair to the north and south, and fair for rural and urban areas. 'Councils can protect frontline services and save the taxpayer billions in cash if they share back office services, tap into their healthy reserves and cut out the non jobs and waste. 'Councils that fail to do these things are letting down their hard working residents.' The council leaders – all from Labour-run cities – have also accused the government of increasing the 'north south divide' through a scheme called the New Homes Bonus. It sees local authorities all fund a bonus pot that rewards local authorities where new homes are built. They say it is sucking money from the north as developers build more homes in the south because of the bigger demand and the higher prices that they command. Figures from public services union Unison reveal that all the top 10 gainers from the scheme in cash terms were in the south while all top 10 net losers were in the north.","Council leaders of Newcastle, Liverpool and Sheffield have warned 'crime and community tensions will erupt'

A seriously ill toddler has been given a second chance at life after receiving a stem cell transplant from the U.S following a transatlantic appeal. Toddler William Morris had been diagnosed with leukaemia at just six weeks old and intensive chemotherapy had failed to eradicate the cancer. The 18-month-old desperately needed a stem cell transplant to help his body make new healthy blood cells after his own had been destroyed by the disease. However, no matches from umbilical cord blood donations could be found in the UK. William Morris, from County Durham received stem cells taken from a mother's umbilical cord in America . But in March last year the youngster . from Chester-le-Street in County Durham was matched with an anonymous . donor in the U.S. He was treated in isolation in Newcastle for two . months and is now in remission. His mother Catherine Wray, 28, said: 'I don't know who the donor is, but I wish I could send a letter to the mum saying 'thank you for helping to save my son's life. 'When William was diagnosed with leukaemia, it was devastating. It was the last thing that we had expected. It was a really scary time as William was so poorly, but we had full faith in the consultants and are so grateful that a stem cell match was found for William.' William was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia, a cancer of the white blood cells and bone marrow, when he was just six weeks old. He underwent four courses of intensive chemotherapy, which were unsuccessful, and within a month had a relapse of his condition. William, pictured in hospital when he was suffering from childhood cancer . On Mother's Day last year, William was admitted to Newcastle Royal Victoria Infirmary's Bubble Unit, where he remained in isolation for two months. He was given a cord blood stem-cell transplant at the end of March and soon began to respond well to the treatment. William is now in remission and continues to be monitored . Over the last two years, the Anthony Nolan Trust has been working closely with the Department of Health and the NHS Cord Blood Bank to ensure that the UK inventory of cord blood units is suitable for clinical transplant increases in order to reduce the reliance on cord blood imported from overseas. Dr Sujith Samarasinghe, a consultant paediatric haematologist at Newcastle Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'William had a high-risk leukaemia. Since the transplant he is doing extremely well. 'It is early days, but there is now no evidence of leukaemia in his system.' William is back at home and is enjoying life with his mother and father, Christopher Morris, 28. Ms Wray said: 'William is like any other child his age and to look at him, you would not think that anything had been wrong. 'He is a cheeky and lovable boy. He is so special in every way.' William's condition is in remission and he continues to be regularly monitored by consultants. Ms Wray, who is now pregnant with twins, has decided to get the umbilical cords of her babies frozen and ""banked"", if they are a suitable match for William, in case cord blood stem cells need to be used at a later date. William recently received a Cancer Research UK Little Star Award, made in partnership with TK Maxx, for his bravery in coping with his condition.

Hundreds of thousands of people in New York and its northern suburbs will still be without power for another 10 days as Consolidated Edison continues to fix the damaged electric grid. Electricity is expected to be restored to the main island of Manhattan by Saturday, however, since the area is largely run by an underground power network that was easier to fix than the downed electrical lines. While ConEd is on track to uphold its original plan of returning power to all of Manhattan island on either Friday or Saturday, officials said that the outer boroughs will have to wait until November 10th or 11th for their power. More than 4.1 million homes and businesses, including about 650,000 ConEd customers, were still without power on Thursday. Scroll down for video . Darkness: Around 227,000 homes and businesses are without power in Manhattan, primarily below 36th Street . The delay in reaching the outer . boroughs of Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and the Bronx was attributed . to the difficulties of fixing or replacing the downed overhead lines. Throughout the week, the company has . been gradually restoring power to portions of the city, and has reached . at least 2,000 people in lower Manhattan so far. While helpful, that is only a sliver of the 227,000 homes and businesses in Manhattan that went dark Monday. In order to avoid permanent damage . from rising sea waters, the company preemptively took two underground . electrical networks out of service and the latest restored power areas . were a result of those networks being reactivated. While that reactivation was relatively . easy, the bigger problems came from a massive explosion at one of the . ConEd power plants in Manhattan's East Village. The explosion came after the plant was overwhelmed by floodwater. Much of this area is in pitch darkness, interrupted by the occasional generator-powered light, headlights, and flashlights . Utility company Consolidated Edison, commonly known as ConEd, are on track to uphold their original plan of returning power to all of Manhattan island on either Friday or Saturday . So far, at least 2,000 people in lower Manhattan have had their power restored . Regardless, the East and West . Villages, Financial District, Chelsea, Chinatown and the Lower East Side . will be up and running by the weekend, Con Edison said. The island's wiring system is largely . underground so workers have been able to asses and repair it faster than . above ground wiring of the outer boroughs. Outages in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island were not expected to be repaired for another week, the power company said. For New Yorkers living in the vertical city, a loss of power means much more than spoiled cold cuts and frozen dinners. Electricity is needed to pump water to . upper floors.

Nasa’s $1.1 billion Juno mission was today hurtling on a path to Jupiter after an ear-splitting launch from Florida, marking the start of a new era of exploration at the US space agency. The pioneering spacecraft roared off its seaside launch pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station mounted aboard the most powerful Atlas V rocket ever constructed, creating a trail of fire and smoke at the start of its six-year, 1.7 million-mile odyssey as scientists cheered and yelled 'Go Juno!' Juno, the second in a series of five major unmanned missions to explore the solar system, will help restore public kudos and purpose to Nasa following the retirement of its shuttle fleet, which has left it without a vehicle of its own to send astronauts into space for at least five years. Scroll down for video . Nasa launched the spacecraft atop an . unmanned Atlas V rocket that blasted into a clear midday sky as scientists . cheered and yelled 'Go Juno!' The spacecraft will take 5 five years to reach orbit around Jupiter and then spend about one year gathering information on Jupiter' magnetic field, atmosphere and interior . 'We were reminded today, in dramatic . fashion, that Nasa is still open for business and leading the world in . space exploration,' said Nasa’s chief, Charlie Bolden. It will take Juno five years to reach its target, five times farther from the sun than Earth. No spacecraft has ever ventured so far, powered by solar wings. Europe's solar-powered, comet-chasing Rosetta probe made it as far as the asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Each of Juno's three wings is 29ft long and 9ft wide, necessary given that Jupiter receives 25 times less sunlight than Earth. The panels - folded for launch - emanate from the spacecraft much like the blades of a windmill. At Jupiter, nearly 500million miles from the sun, Juno's panels will provide 400 watts of power. In orbit around Earth, these panels would generate 35 times as much power. 'Our future in space exploration is . bright and holds many such cutting-edge science missions that will help . us better understand our solar system and an ever-increasing array of . challenging destinations where humans might travel.' The project has been ten years in the . making, involving scientists and spacecraft engineers from more than 20 . institutions in the US and Europe. Juno is set to beam back the most . comprehensive data and close-up images ever gathered from the so-called . King of the Planets, a giant gas ball so vast that it could swallow . Earth 1,200 times over. Astrophysicists believe that by . understanding the composition and structure of Jupiter, the earliest and . largest of the planets in our solar system, they will be able to piece . together answers to enticing questions about the origins of the universe . more than 4.5 billion years ago - and how, when and why life on Earth . began. 'Ignition and lift off of the Atlas V . with Juno, on a trek to Jupiter - a planetary piece of the puzzle on . the beginning of our solar system,' announced Nasa launch commentator . George Diller. Juno blasted off with ear piercing speed, but will . become the . fastest-travelling man-made object ever as it gets closer to Jupiter, . drawn in by the planet’s enormous magnetic field, when it will be . travelling at 160,000mph . Environmentally-friendly: The windmill-shaped craft is equipped with three tractor-trailer-size solar panels for its two billion-mile journey into the outer solar system . Project managers hugged and slapped . one another with high-fives in celebration of the successful launch. The . 20-storey stack lifted off 51 minutes late due to a last-minute ground . control anomaly, lifting into a clear blue patch of sky and accelerating . from zero to 700mph in just 30 seconds. It shed its record five solid rocket . boosters as planned during its high-speed climb to Earth orbit, where it . then 'parked' for half an hour before two burns of its Centaur engine . turned it on the correct trajectory for Jupiter. Over the next five years, the . unmanned vehicle will fly a looping path taking it out past Mars orbit . and back for a fly-by of the Earth in 2013, when it will use our . planet’s gravity to slingshot itself further out towards Jupiter. It . will be powered only by solar energy, making it the furthest-travelled . spacecraft ever driven by the Sun. As Juno cartwheels closer to Jupiter, . it will become drawn in by the planet’s enormous magnetic field, which . stretches 2.6 million miles and is nearly 20,000 times as powerful as . Earth’s. Travelling at 160,000mph, Juno will become the . fastest-travelling man-made object ever. How it will look: Each of Juno's three wings is 29ft long and 9ft wide. The panels - folded for launch - are here seen emanating from the spacecraft much like the blades of a windmill . Long journey ahead: It will take Juno five years to reach its target, five times farther from the sun than Earth . The 11.5ft (3.5metre) probe will get . closer to Jupiter than any previous mission, making its closest approach . 3,100 miles (5,000kms) above the planet’s cloud tops and using its . suite of nine onboard instruments to peer through them. If Jupiter was . the size of a basketball, the equivalent distance would be just 0.8 . centimetres (0.3 inches). The vehicle is named after the . goddess Juno, who according to Roman mythology could see through the . clouds that her husband Jupiter, the kind of the gods – would draw . around him . So vast and deadly are the radiation . fields around Jupiter that the spacecraft will be bombarded by the . equivalent of 100 million dental X-rays as it spends its sixth year in . space orbiting Jupiter, completing 33 laps of the planet as it measures . its gravitational and magnetic fields, takes data from its deep . atmosphere and unlocks the mysteries of the planet’s brilliant auroras – . its northern and southern lights. Passengers: Three Lego figurines representing the Roman god Jupiter, his wife Juno and Galileo Galilei will travel aboard the Juno spacecraft on its journey to Jupiter . Destination: Jupiter as seen by the New Horizons spacecraft in 2007 . It will also determine whether Jupiter has a solid, rotating core deep within its mass of helium and hydrogen gases. Juno’s command and data handling box – . the spacecraft’s 'brain' – and other electronic assemblies have been . encased inside a titanium vault around the size of a large car boot to . protect them from the immense radiation, which would otherwise wreck . them. Maj-Gen Bolden said: 'The largest . planet in our neighbourhood is about to reveal its secrets, and . everything Juno finds will help us understand more about the origins and . evolution of our solar system. 'This is exciting stuff. The kind of . thing that inspires young people to pursue careers in science, . technology, engineering and mathematics.

Couric said that Kate would be her choice but there was one issue: ‘I think she's getting too thin.’ Kate reportedly lost 10lbs and went from a size eight to a size six in the weeks before her marriage to Prince William in order to fit into her wedding dress. She was reportedly on the Dukan Diet which limits those on it to just protein like fish during the first, most brutal stage. This is not the first time Kate’s weight has come us as other commentators have raised concerns she may be getting too thin, especially if she wants to have a baby. Uncharted access: Katie Couric had a tour of the Royal gardens during her earlier interview with Prince William . 'Too thin': Kate's weight has been a topic of constant talk as she lost an alleged 10 pounds before her wedding . The Royal Household has also been sensitive to weight issues since 1995 when Princess Diana publicly admitted that she suffered from bulimia and made herself vomit after eating. When interviewer Martin Bashir asked her what the Royal Family thought of her problems, Diana replied: ‘They thought it was a waste of food’. Speaking to USA Today, Couric also laid into CBS again where she hosted the Evening News for five years before leaving under acrimonious circumstances. Couric had claimed that working there left her she felt ‘constrained’ and that departing was like being ‘liberated’. In her latest interview she said: ‘Ultimately I'm very proud of the work I did, but really tinkering with the format of a newscast might have been more difficult than initially thought by everyone. Rare: The princes grant infrequent interviews so it was considered a 'get' when Couric was able to sit down with both . Royal audience: During the Jubilee, Couric met the Queen at a garden party . ‘In hindsight I probably should have examined that more carefully: Could you really change the format in a way that it would capitalize on my particular skill set, which is doing interviews, interacting, being more spontaneous, being a little more casual. Former love: Couric split from her 17-years-junior boyfriend Brooks Perlin in December . ‘Nobody has a crystal ball, but I wish I'd been a little more circumspect about the possibility of doing that.’ Couric - who is famous for her controlled public image - added that even though she expects her chat show guests to open up, she will not be doing so herself. She said: ‘Only when it's relevant and only when it's a natural part of the conversation. ‘If we're talking about dating over 50, I might say what my attitude is about it. I'm not going to talk about the date I had the night before. ‘I want to talk about my own experiences, but I don't want to overshare.’ One of those experiences was her five-year relationship with Brooks Perlin, a man 17 years her junior.

A  cuckolded husband has been living in a tree for the last nine months, refusing to come down until his wife apologises for cheating on him. But the apology never came and, nine months later, Sanjay, 25, is still there, wondering if wife Tara will ever take him back. Sanjay, whose surname is not known, married Tara last year in Baragaon, Varanasi, before moving to Mumbai. Protest: An Indian man who discovered his wife in bed with another man has taken to living in a tree in the village of Baragoan (pictured) until she apologises . But in March he returned home from work a little early to find his new bride in a compromising position with their next-door neighbour. Hurt and humiliated, he demanded an apology for the infidelity but she refused so he took her back to their village in a bid to resolve their differences. But she remained defiant, saying she wanted to return to Mumbai before leaving for her parents house. Heartsick: After discovering his wife's infidelity, the heartbroken man returned to his village . So in a last ditch effort to win her back, Sanjay shimmied up a guava tree on the outskirts of the village and has remained there ever since. He says he will climb down only when his wife apologises for her misdeeds and returns to him. Despite renewed attempts by his family to persuade her, Tara would not budge. Initially he refused food, surviving only on the guava fruit picked from the branches of the tree. But when none were left, he was forced to swallow his pride and relied on his mother, who faithfully brought him snacks from home. Stubborn: Initially Sanjay refused food, surviving only on the guava fruit picked from the branches of the tree . 'He climbed on to this tree on March 9 and has remained there ever since.

But they say he quickly scurries back up to his branch if he thinks somebody is nearby.

"By . Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 00:00 EST, 14 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:08 EST, 14 January 2013 . Suicides in the U.S. military surged to a record 349 last year, far exceeding American combat deaths in Afghanistan, and some private experts are predicting the dark trend will grow worse this year. The Pentagon has struggled to deal with the suicides, which Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and others have called an epidemic. The problem reflects severe strains on military personnel burdened with more than a decade of combat in Afghanistan and Iraq, complicated by anxiety over the prospect of being forced out of a shrinking force. Pentagon figures obtained Monday by The Associated Press show that the 349 suicides among active-duty troops last year were up from 301 the year before and exceeded the Pentagon's own internal projection of 325. Army Reserve Soldiers honor fallen soldiers at Fort Bragg, North Carolina on Jan. 10, 2012. Suicides in the U.S. military surged to a record 349 last year, far exceeding American combat deaths in Afghanistan . Statistics alone do not explain why troops take their own lives, and the Pentagon's military and civilian leaders have acknowledged that more needs to be done to understand the causes. Last year's total is the highest since the Pentagon began closely tracking suicides in 2001. It exceeds the 295 Americans who died in Afghanistan last year, by the AP's count. Some in Congress are pressing the Pentagon to do more. 'This is an epidemic that cannot be ignored,' Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said Monday. 'As our newest generation of service members and veterans face unprecedented challenges, today's news shows we must be doing more to ensure they are not slipping through the cracks.' Military suicides began rising in 2006 and soared to a then-record 310 in 2009 before leveling off for two years. It came as a surprise to many that the numbers resumed an upward climb this year, given that U.S. military involvement in Iraq is over and the Obama administration is taking steps to wind down the war in Afghanistan. Libby Busbee stands in her living room with a photo over her late son U.S. Army Spc. William Busbee, who committed suicide in March of 2012 . 'Now that we're decreasing our troops and they're coming back home, that's when they're really in the danger zone, when they're transitioning back to their families, back to their communities and really finding a sense of purpose for themselves,' said Kim Ruocco, whose husband, Marine Maj. John Ruocco, killed himself between Iraq deployments in 2005. She directs a suicide prevention program for a support group, Tragedy Assistance Programs, or TAPS. The Army, by far the largest of the military services, had the highest number of suicides among active-duty troops last year at 182, but the Marine Corps, whose suicide numbers had declined for two years, had the largest percentage increase — a 50 percent jump to 48. The Marines' worst year was 2009's 52 suicides. The Air Force recorded 59 suicides, up 16 percent from the previous year, and the Navy had 60, up 15 percent. All of the numbers are tentative, pending the completion later this year of formal pathology reports on each case. Suicide prevention has become a high Pentagon priority, yet the problem persists. Matt and Cheryl Ecker hold a photo of their son, Army veteran Michael Ecker, who committed suicide at age 25 in front of his father . Ecker is pictured with his parents. He raised a gun to his head after saluting to his father and shot himself . 'If you have a perfect storm of events on the day with somebody who has high risk factors, it's very difficult to be there every moment, fill every crack, and we just have to continue to be aware of what the risk factors are,' Ruocco said. David Rudd, a military suicide researcher and dean of the College of Social and Behavioral Sciences at the University of Utah, said he sees two main categories of troops who are committing suicide at an accelerating pace: Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans suffering from depression, post-traumatic stress or substance abuse, and those who have not gone to war but face troubled personal relationships, money problems or legal woes. He is not optimistic about a decline soon. 'Actually, we may continue to see increases,' he said. The Pentagon says that although the military suicide rate has been rising, it remains below that of the civilian population. It says the civilian suicide rate for males aged 17-60 was 25 per 100,000 in 2010, the latest year for which such statistics are available. That compares with the military's rate in 2012 of 17.5 per 100,000. Officials say they are committed to pursuing ways of finding help for service members in trouble. 'Our most valuable resource within the department is our people. We are committed to taking care of our people, and that includes doing everything possible to prevent suicides in the military,' Pentagon spokeswoman Cynthia O. Smith said Monday. Two retired Army generals, Peter W. Chiarelli and Dennis J. Reimer, have spoken out about the urgency of reversing the trend. The Army had the highest number of suicides among but the Marine Corps had the largest percentage increase . 'One of the things we learned during our careers,' they wrote in The Washington Post last month, 'is that stress, guns and alcohol constitute a dangerous mixture. In the wrong proportions, they tend to blow out the lamp of the mind and cause irrational acts.' Joe Davis, spokesman for the Washington office of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, said war veterans have faced difficulty adjusting to the less intense environment of their home bases. Others struggle with leaving the military in search of work in a tight civilian job market. 'It's difficult to come back from a war footing to garrison life,' he said, where more mundane problems intrude on troops who had been focused almost entirely on their war mission. Suicides in the U.S. military among active-duty troops surged to a record 349 last year. The number, an increase of 48 suicides compared to 2011, represents a record high since the military began tracking suicides in 2001.  The number also exceeds the 295 . Americans who died in Afghanistan last year. The Army, by far the largest of the military services, had the highest number of suicides among active-duty troops last year at 182, but the Marine Corps, whose suicide numbers had declined for two years, had the largest percentage increase — a 50 percent jump to 48. The Marines' worst year was 2009's 52 suicides. Each year the Pentagon performs an in-depth study of the circumstances of each suicide. The most recent year for which that analysis is available is 2011, and among the findings was that those who took their own lives tended to be white men under the age of 25, in the junior enlisted ranks, with less than a college education. The analysis of 2011's 301 military suicides also found that the suicide rate for divorced service members was 55 percent higher than for those who were married. It determined that 60 percent of military suicides were committed with the use of firearms — and in most cases the guns were personal weapons, not military-issued. That study also found that most service members who attempted suicide — about 65 percent — had a known history of behavior problems, whereas 45 percent of those who actually completed the act and killed themselves had such a history. One such case was Army Spc. Christopher Nguyen, 29, who killed himself last August at an off-post residence he shared with another member of the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, N.C., according to his sister, Shawna Nguyen. 'He was practically begging for help and nothing was done,' she said in an interview. She said he had been diagnosed with an 'adjustment disorder' — a problem of coping with the uncertainties of returning home after three deployments in war zones. She believes the Army failed her brother by not doing more to ensure that he received the help he needed before he became suicidal. 'It's the responsibility of the military to help these men and women,' she said. 'They sent them over there (to war); they should be helping them when they come back.'","The number, an increase of 48 suicides compared to 2011, represents a record high since the military began tracking suicides in 2001 .

The Battle of Britain was the German air force's attempt to gain air superiority over the RAF from July to September 1940. It was one of the turning points of World War Two and prevented Germany from invading Britain. The battle began in mid-July with Luftwaffe concentrating on attacking shipping in the . English Channel and attacking coastal towns and defences. From 12 August, Hermann . Goering, one of the leaders of the Nazi regime, shifted his focus to the . destruction of the RAF, attacking airfields and radar bases. (Pictured above, RAF scrambling to their planes in 1940.) Convinced that Fighter Command was . now close to defeat, he also tried to force air battles between fighter . planes to break British strength. However, Goering grew frustrated by . the large number of British planes that were still fighting off his . attacks. Luftwaffe switched tactics again and, on . Hitler's orders, set about destroying London and other major cities. Eleven days later, on what became 'Battle of Britain Day', the . RAF decimated the huge incoming Luftwaffe formations in the skies above . London and the south coast. He was shot down for a third time on . September 20, 1941, after being ‘jumped’ by five Me109s as he flew over . France in a Spitfire. His parents, Reverend Gilbert Barclay and wife . Dorothy – who lost another son, Charles, in the war – received a letter . reporting that he was missing. It stated: ‘He was very popular in the Officers’ Mess and his cheerful personality will be greatly missed.’ Remarkably, however, Barclay  had . survived, and ended up in a French field. He turned his uniform inside . out to hide the insignia that would reveal his identity, and pretended . to be a farm worker as Nazis came looking for him. He was helped by many French civilians . and managed to escape through Spain over a three-month period. His . diary entry on September 26 describes how he was given  shelter by a . French woman called Madame Salingue. He wrote: ‘I was given a very friendly . welcome. Immediately we arrived Madame cooked us two eggs  and chips . each. 'Apparently that is what the troops asked for before Dunkirk. Burbare had quite a large number of British troops billeted there and . wherever I went I was shown photos of them. The French liked them very . much.’ After returning home to Cromer, . Norfolk, Barclay was put in charge of battle-weary 238 Squadron and  led . them out to patrol the El Alamein area of Egypt – where he was fatally . shot down. He received a posthumous salute from England in January 1943, when he was Mentioned in Despatches in New Year Honours. His parents did not discover his diary . until a few years after his death. A version was published in the . 1970s, but an extended edition has now been compiled by historians and . his brother Richard, now 86, a retired banking director. The father of four from . Minchinhampton, Gloucestershire, said: ‘We had no idea that he was . writing a diary, he never mentioned it when he was on leave. ‘It tells of squadron life and the . numerous pressures and battles which demonstrate the extraordinary . dedication and self-sacrifice of all the young men in the country.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 12:17 EST, 13 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:39 EST, 14 January 2013 . Watching her two children fight for their lives side by side in intensive care after a horrific car crash, Julie Elstob told herself it had to be a nightmare. Sophie, eight, had suffered a fractured skull, while Jack, ten, had a bleed on the brain, and doctors warned he may never walk again. Yet little more than three months on, Jack and Sophie Handyside are both home and on the mend - astonishing medics and delighting their mother. Miracle children: Jack and Sophie Handyside have made almost full recoveries after being left side-by-side in intensive care following a head-on car crash . The head-on crash happened as they were . travelling with their father, Darren Handyside, along a country road in . County Durham on September 29. He suffered abdominal injuries and was flown to hospital in Middlesbrough, while the children were airlifted to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle, where they were put on life support. Jack underwent emergency surgery to remove two parts of his skull, allowing his brain to swell safely. Mrs Elstob, a nurse, said: 'It was horrendous. It was just like a dream, I couldn’t believe it was happening. 'They were both in intensive care on a life support machine, side by side. 'I can’t put into words what it was like.' Jack, who was in hospital for 15 weeks, will have to have parts of his skull replaced, while Sophie, who was dubbed ‘miracle girl’ by medics, was discharged on October 24  and returned back to her primary school before Christmas. Julie, 41, said: 'It’s amazing how far they have come on. I can’t believe Sophie got out so quick and Jack is now following in her footsteps. 'He’s doing stuff again that I never believed he would. 'Over Christmas and New Year it was the first nights we had him home and I can’t believe he’s now been discharged. Little angel: Sophie before the crash. She was dubbed a 'miracle child' by doctors, who were astounded by her recovery . 'I remember seeing some other children walking out of the hospital and I never thought it was ever going to be them. 'I’m just so happy they’re both home and on the mend.' Following the horror crash near their home, the children were airlifted to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle, where they spent time in the intensive care unit. The youngsters were travelling in the car with their father Darren, 45, who suffered abdominal injuries in the crash on the A688 near Raby Castle. A 78-year-old woman from Sunderland, who was driving the other car, a black Vauxhall Corsa, suffered minor injuries and was taken to Darlington Memorial Hospital. It is not yet known how the accident happened. Blessed: Jack, 10, had to have two pieces of his skull removed and was on a life support machine for weeks after the crash . Julie said: 'It happened on Saturday morning and on the Sunday I just kept watching the screens. 'The pressure in Jack’s head was rising and rising. On the Sunday night he was rushed into theatre. 'They removed two large parts of his skull to allow the brain to swell safely. 'In the beginning we were told Jack would struggle to walk again, he wasn’t eating, talking or responding. 'I can’t describe what it was like. 'We knew how serious Jack was and they moved him to be next to Sophie so it was easier for us to watch them both. 'Because I’m a nurse I knew it didn’t look good. It was like a dream, I just wanted to wake up.' The youngster is getting back to her normal life and is enjoying spending time with her two pet rabbits and guinea pig. In the future it is hoped that Jack, . who played rugby for his local under-11 team, and was goalkeeper for his . school football team, will return to playing sport. The family are now planning a number of fundraising events to raise money for the GNAAS charity. Julie would like to thank everybody who has supported Jack and Sophie in their recovery, including members of the public on the scene, paramedics, fire crews, the Great North Air Ambulance, the doctors on board and the paediatric intensive care unit at the RVI. Julie added: 'It makes me proud to be part of the NHS.'","Jack Handyside, 10, and sister Sophie, eight, BOTH put on life support .

Stepping through the front door of East Dagworth Hall is like going on a journey back in time. The timber-framed building dates from the 15th Century but stands on the site of a far older medieval hall with a very colourful past. For centuries, Dagworth Hall was a manor house. Then, in the Fifties, it was divided into two homes – East and West Dagworth Hall. Anicent: East Dagworth Hall is a 15th Century manor standing on the site of a medieval seat visited by kings . Jeremy and Hannah Steventon-Barnes, the owners of East Dagworth Hall, near Stowmarket in Suffolk, have traced its history to before the Domesday Book in 1086, and the results of their painstaking five-year research are documented on their website, dagworth.steventon-barnes.com. And the house was seen last summer in the BBC2 series The Great British Story when its presenter, historian Michael Wood, investigated the area as a corner of Anglo-Saxon England. The first known Dagworth resident was a Saxon called Breme, who farmed a large tract of land much bigger than the plot on which the dozen or so homes that make up the hamlet sit today. The medieval residents took the place name as their own. A knight called Richard de Dagworth lived at the manor from 1205. It remained in the family name until 1401, with his great-grandson Nicholas (1306 to 1351) among his descendants who lived there. Home of joy: Jeremy and Hannah Steventon-Barnes, pictured with their children Barney, Zac and Theo, at East Dagworth Hall which saw the birth of their two younger sons . Features of the property’s past include a mischievous ghost called Malekin, a visit from King John and his Court in 1216, and a character called Valentine Blomfield, born at Dagworth Hall on February 14, 1793, who settled in Australia and gave his estate there the same name. The Steventon-Barneses have lived in the four-bedroom house for nine years, bringing up their young sons, Zac, ten, Barney, eight, and Theo, six. Now they have put it up for sale at £399,995 because they are moving to give their growing boys more space. ‘It’s been wonderful to live somewhere with so much history,’ says Jeremy, 42, a network director for BT. East Dagworth Hall is a quirky house that has undergone few structural changes – and those with a sense of romance could find their spiritual home here. In the double-height hallway you are immediately struck by the history: the sloping timbers, the odd-shaped windows above the stairs, and the framed portrait of Valentine Blomfield that the Steventon-Barneses managed to track down. Tudor style: The sitting room in the Grade II listed home has an inglenook fireplace and exposed beams . The long history of East Dagworth Hall includes visits from a 13th century king, a ghost called Malekin and a knightly owner . The hall leads to a cosy family/dining room at the back of the house, complete with an old Aga, which is supplemented by a smaller kitchen overlooking a side garden. There’s also a study converted from a lean-to, from where you can see through to the family room, and a further office in an outbuilding. However, the most impressive room is the main sitting room, which has a large inglenook with a log-burner, windows with garden views at both ends and exposed overhead beams, including a vast blackened Tudor beam near the fireplace. Upstairs, the four bedrooms – all different shapes with yet more exposed timbers – are as idiosyncratic as the rest of the house. The master bedroom has a fireplace and enough space to fit an en suite (subject to planning permission, as the house is Grade II listed), though there’s a bathroom on this floor and a shower room downstairs. Lots of cooking: For the hobby-Heston there is plenty of space to cook - this is just the supplement kitchen . All the upstairs rooms have views over the gardens and countryside. As Jeremy points out, the landscape has remained pretty unscathed for 1,000 years, with little change to the layout of the fields. East Dagworth Hall’s grounds, bounded by the River Gipping, would be a major draw for a keen gardener. There’s an orchard, a large sunny terrace, roses, honeysuckle in summer, a walled children’s play area, a wild area near the river and a lawned section. In the nine years Jeremy and Hannah have lived in the hall, they have done some replastering and decorating but no major work. ‘I love the fact that there have been so many people here before us,’ says Hannah, 40. ‘Both my younger sons were born at home. When I had Barney, I remember wondering how many people had been born in this house before him. It gives you a sense of belonging.’ David Burr, 01359 245245, davidburr.co.uk .","Four bedroom manor hall in Suffolk on sale for £400,000 .

Furious: Transsexual Katrina Harte, 50, of North Shields, has accused North Tyneside Council of discrimination after a worker refused to believe that she is a women . A transsexual has accused a council of discrimination after a member of staff wouldn't accept payment for a parking fine - because the worker wouldn't believe she was a woman. Katrina Harte has complained to North Tyneside Council after the worker told her that she was a man and not the owner of the car at fault. The 50-year-old, who underwent an NHS-funded sex change operation and put herself in £4,000 of debt paying for breast enlargement surgery, said: 'I was furious, I burst into tears.' 'Aren't they supposed to have a policy where they don't discriminate against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual people? 'I lodged a complaint there and then.' North Tyneside Council is refusing to discipline the worker involved as they say she never meant any deliberate offence. Katrina's car was caught on camera back in October as she parked for a few moments in a bus stop in North Shields. North Tyneside. Because she had been doing a friend a favour, Katrina, who is awaiting a tracheal shave to remove her Adam's apple, contested the ticket with the council by filling out a mitigation form. But she was ordered to pay the fine anyway so phoned the authority's parking control department. She said: 'A woman answered and I gave her my name and address. 'Then she said she couldn’t accept my payment because the car is registered to a female and I’m clearly a man. 'It was like a smack in the face and I burst out crying. 'She apologised when I put her right, but the damage was done and she should never have said those words. 'I’ve had letters from North Tyneside Council telling me they won’t be taking disciplinary action because the words weren’t intentional, but that’s not the point. 'I want a full apology from them.' Katrina, who has three children from her previous life as a man, says the upsetting incident demonstrates just how essential it is that she has the tracheal shave. Apology: North Tyneside Council has apologised for the incident involving Ms Harte but says it will take no disciplinary action against the member of staff as no intentional offence was caused . However, health bosses last year refused to bankroll the surgery, saying it is considered to be a cosmetic procedure. The former engineer had planned to save up the £2,000 needed to pay for the op privately, but is struggling to save the cash. A spokesman for North Tyneside Council said: 'Good customer service and equality matters are both taken very seriously by North Tyneside Council. 'We are disappointed that Ms Harte feels these standards have not been met and we again reiterate our sincerest apologies, as already expressed to her on this matter, both by individuals concerned and through our formal complaints procedure. 'Our in depth investigations into the incident, through the corporate complaints process, have confirmed that a member of staff made a genuine error with no intention to cause any distress.'","Katrina Harte, 50 has accused North Tyneside Council of discrimination .

The daughter of hospital consultants and a former pupil at the £15,000 a year Badminton School, she won a place at university and the future looked promising. But once at university she began to experiment with drugs and admitted taking cocaine, Ecstasy and cannabis as well as ketamine and diazapam. As she studied for a Masters degree, the 22-year-old began to suffer severe problems with paranoia. Her mental collapse tragically ended when she threw herself to her death off the top of a city centre car park. And to add a final insult, her mobile phone was stolen by a sick thief as she lay dying in the road. Yesterday her parents told an inquest of the tragic slide in their daughter’s mental health. Her mother Annette, a hospital consultant, said the family had no idea she had experimented with so many drugs. She said she was aware that at one point her daughter had experimented with cannabis. ‘I was aware that there may have been some smoking of cannabis but I wasn't aware of other things until after she died. Mrs Jardine said her daughter, a philosophy student at Manchester University, began to suffer from anxiety and palpitations and ended up receiving hospital treatment. Tragic: Philosophy student Rachel Jardine died after jumping from a multi-storey car park . She said that on one occasion she had phoned and appeared anxious and paranoid. Mrs Jardine said: She really didn't . want us to come and fetch her. She said: ‘I'm a bit frightened to go . out, I feel paranoid and scared’ and I came to see her and I said: ‘You . must go back to your GP.’ ‘I said: ‘Let’s make an appointment’ but it wasn't in a bad way, so I thought.’ Scene of the tragedy: Miss Jardine died from her injuries after plunging 80ft from this car park in Manchester city centre in the early hours of Wednesday . The inquest was told Rachel had first . been to her local GP, Dr Archana Griffin in January this year and . confided that she had used ketamine, Ecstasy, cocaine and diazapam. She was referred to the Manchester . Mental Health Team in March but by the time of her death on May 18 had . still yet to receive an appointment. Despite speaking to her mother, . Annette, every day her condition worsened and the night before she died . she called her mother again and said she was going to kill herself. Mrs Jardine said: ‘When I said what's . going on she said she'd had an argument with her boyfriend and that she . was going to ring him. I said I didn't think she should but that if she . did to ring me back after. ‘And she did ring me back after . midnight. She said 'I can't do life anymore’. She said: ‘I'm going to go . into town and jump off a building’ and I said: ‘Calm down. There’s no . need for anything like that. ‘I remember thinking there's no . buildings she could get into to jump off and I said: ‘Calm down‘. And . then she said she'd made her boyfriend angry and said something about . integrity and she hung up.’ On the day of her death she phoned her mother five times in an ‘agitated’ state. Heartless: Ben Heney stole a phone from a dying woman in Manchester . Mrs Jardine called her daughter on her mobile phone and realised she was walking in Manchester. ‘I had a long conversation she told me where she was and that she was in a car park and I thought: ‘She's serious about this.’’ She tried to calm her daughter down but could not keep her focussed. When her daughter said ’Goodbye’ Mrs . Jardine immediately called the police. The student was using her pink . mobile phone to call her mother moments before she threw herself from . the top of the car park. Miss Jardine plunged 80 feet but as she lay on the ground with fatal injuries, drug addict Ben Heney, 23, snatched her phone. Heney was subsequently jailed for 12 weeks for theft after his crime was caught on CCTV.

She was booted off Dancing on Ice during the first week and now Pamela Anderson is blaming her boobs for her departure. The Baywatch star, 45, believes she was voted out of the competition because her outfit failed to contain her modesty - a situation she describes as 'common' in her life. The cosmetically enhanced actress was appearing on this morning when she put her exit down to her chest. Scroll down for video . Blaming the boobs: Pamela Anderson blamed her exit from Dancing on Ice on suffering a wardrobe malfunction which left her breasts on popping out of her dress . Pamela said: 'I feel so bad for Matt [Evers]. I stumbled, my boobs fell out. It's common in my life.' She added: 'The wardrobe assistant didn't cross the petals over how she should have done. Maybe it was a conspiracy theory! Kidding.' 'I've done that routine flawlessly but I was only here a few days from LA so I didn't know what was going on.' What a shame: The 45-year-old actress appeared on This Morning and said: 'I feel so bad for Matt [Evers]. I stumbled, my boobs fell out. It's common in my life.' Graceful: Pamela had shown promise as a skater, but her mistake during the skate-off cost her a place in the next episode . It seems the embarrassment of bowing . out of the competition first has left the actress ruling out appearing . on any reality shows in the future. Asked . whether she'd do reality TV again, she said: No, I'm never doing this . again. I don't think I should be in this environment anyway. I don't . know what I'm doing.' 'Everyone around me tells me not to do it, but I just do what I want.' It's a conspiracy: Pammie joked that the wardrobe assistant was to blame for not putting the petals over her nipples as she should have done . She's done with reality: Pamela said that she wouldn't do another TV show again, but said she might go to Vegas to do a show next . Pamela added that she may well take up a spot in Sin City next and says she is inundated with request to perform then. She said: 'Maybe I'll do Vegas next. I'm always being asked to front my own show.'

Wardrobe malfunction: Pamela struggled to stay in her dress during the skate-off . Do you think the Dancing On Ice judges were correct to send Pamela Anderson home? Although she had performed strongly in . her first dance earlier on Sunday evening, her second dance was ruined by her dress issue. Fortunately for Pamela, the wardrobe team was prepared and she was wearing matching white and silver nipple covers to protect her modesty when her right breast started to escape from the tight dress. Pamela's exit was a shock to bookmakers Ladbrokes, who had given her 20/1 odds to be first voted out. Although she was in the top half of . the leaderboard and Chegwin was at the bottom, her luck didn't translate . to her second dance. For . the skate-off, Pamela performed another slow number to Sinead . O'Connor's cover of Sacrifice, following her earlier skate to Emeli . Sande's Read All About It. After . the dance, Pamela admitted she had struggled with her dress, with host . Philip Schofield joking: 'If that happened earlier, you wouldn't be in . the skate-off.' TV . presenter Chegwin, who was forced to quit last year's show after . breaking his ribs, performed a new dance to O Fortuna after his earlier . skate to D:ream's Things Can Only Get Better. Lacking support: Pamela looked uncomfortable in her tiny dress during the performance . Following the skate-off, it was up to the judges to decide their fate. Karen Barber said: 'I'd like to save you both, but the best performance that time was Keith.' Ashley Roberts agreed: 'Because of the stumbles I'm saving Keith.'

"By . Graham Smith . UPDATED: . 08:09 EST, 17 February 2012 . A friendly rivalry has long existed between the U.S. and Canada and many Americans enjoy nothing more than poking fun at their neighboring nation. But, with the exception of the War of 1812 two centuries ago, the two countries have stood side-by-side and are today the world's largest trading partners. In a further boost to this mutual love-in, a poll has - rather surprisingly -  revealed that Americans rate Canada as their favourite country. A landslide 96 per cent of U.S. citizens surveyed rate Canada favourably, a four per cent rise on this time last year. Border crossing: Americans rate Canada as their favourite country, with 96 per cent signalling their approval for their next-door neighbour, according to a poll . More surprisingly, Australia came second in the Gallup poll with a 93 per cent approval rating. Britain rounded out the top three, proving that the enduring . 'special relationship' between the U.S. and UK is supported by the . American public too. Germany and Japan came fourth and . fifth respectively, followed by another unexpected choice in sixth place . with 75 per cent approval - France. It has been less than ten years since relations between the U.S. and France were at a low. In the second Gulf war against Iraq, . the U.S. dubbed the French ‘cheese-eating surrender monkeys’ and . re-branded French Fries as ‘Freedom Fries’ when the nation failed to . support the 2003 invasion. Popularity contest: Iran came bottom in the Gallup poll, hardly surprising considering the escalating showdown between the Islamic Republic and the West over its nuclear program . Equally surprising is the growth in favourability towards Mexico. Ravaged by an ongoing war on drug . gangs that has seen more than 40,000 people killed, six per cent more . Americans than a year ago approve of the country. This comes just days after the U.S. State Department this week recommended Americans avoid travel to all or parts of 14 of 31 Mexican . states in the widest travel advisory since the country stepped up its drug . war in 2006. The advisory said U.S. citizens have been victims of drug violence, including killings, kidnappings and car-jackings.

With . 70ft waves crashing over his upturned boat and 100mph winds whipping his hair, . stricken sailor Rudy Snel had one thought going through his mind - he was going . to die. The . 62-year-old thought: ‘I’ve had a good run. I’ll just have to accept that this . is it.’ As . it turned out, he was wrong. He . and colleagues Ben Tye, 31, and Jean Pierre de Lutz, 57, lived to tell their . tale, but the Atlantic Ocean came pretty close to finishing them off. The view from a U.S. Coast Guard helicopter shows the scale of the storm and the size of the raft as they waited to pick up the last two survivors out of three about 240 miles off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina . De . Lutz suffered 11 broken ribs as they struggled with waves that were so powerful . they felt like a truck hitting them. For . six hours they were marooned on their rescue raft surrounded by ‘the absolute . height of nature’s fury’ as they waited to die. But . incredibly a rescue team somehow found them after they set off an SOS beacon - . and lifted them to safety. The . trio have now told their story for the first time in a book which explains just . how close they came to a watery grave. Ben Tye clings to a raft during an attempted rescue after de Lutz's boat, the Sean Seamour II sank in rough seas in the Atlantic Ocean . Boat captain Jean Pierre de Lutz pictured here in calmer seas with his dog considers himself lucky to have survived the sinking . Ben Tye (left) managed to make it off the ship with Rudy Snel (right with beard) before the Sean Seamour II capsized . Their . journey began when de Lutz placed an advert online in 2007 for a crew for his . boat, the Sean Seamour II to travel from Florida to the Azores, then on to . Gibraltar and Saint-Tropez. De . Lutz was an experienced sailor and had been at sea since his teens whilst Snel . was a retired schoolteacher looking for the trip of a lifetime. They . set off on May 2 that year, which was deliberately early to avoid hurricanes. Instead they came face to face with Tropical Storm Andrea. By . midday on May 6th, when they were 240 miles off Cape Hatteras, NC, several low . pressure systems began to converge with ominous ‘wispy yellow-brown clouds’. According . to an extract in the New York Post, Snel says: ‘I don’t think I’ve ever seen . clouds that colour. They’re so menacing.’ Suddenly . the sky turned dark and winds got to 45 knots (52mph). De Lutz writes: ‘This is . not good. Nothing is going as planned. The weather is not as predicted.’ In May 2007 the three men set sail across the Atlantic aboard the Sean Seamour II to travel from Florida to the Azores, then on to Gibraltar and Saint-Tropez . The . wind escalates to 35, then 60 and then 80 knots. The waves rise to 15ft - then . surge to 50ft. Author . Michael Tougias, who has written the book with the men, writes: ‘More than one . wave smacks so hard that Rudy likens it to being hit by a truck. ‘Good . God, he thinks, that felt more like a solid object than liquid.’ Come . the next morning, things are even worse when a ‘thunderous boom’ sends Snel . from his bed flying into the air. Tye . smashes into de Lutz and bounces off him ‘so that his back and buttocks hit the . bulkhead where the TV is mounted; it shatters in a spray of glass and plastic.’ The . Sean Seamour II is sent ‘careening over its starboard side. Objects not bolted . down are hurled through the boat like missiles, and canned soft drinks burst . like rockets, spraying in all directions.’ A . table slams into de Lutz, breaking eight ribs. The men were hit by subtropical storm Andrea -- a storm so powerful that one ship at sea lost 21 containers and the U.S. Coast Guard would eventually rescue nine people, including Mr. Snel's crew . Ben Tye after he had been rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard and brought onto a rescue helicopter that had raced to meet them after they manage to send a distress call . Tougias . writes: ‘He feels the water climb up the backside of his neck and head, . followed by silence as his ears submerge. ‘He . frantically fights to free himself, but he’s pinned by the tabletop. I’m going . to drown inside my own boat!’ The . other two men wrestle him clear and, in an astonishing display of bravery, de . Lutz swims outside the boat to get the life raft so they can get out of the . boat, which is filling up with 2ft of water. The . books says: ‘Every movement of the boat causes agony that can’t be ignored. ‘Piercing . pain radiates from his broken ribs...an especially large wave breaks directly . on him, and the mast is pushed down on the left side of his back, crushing him . against the deck. ‘He . moans in agony. Another three ribs are broken.’ The . men manage to scramble into the raft just as the Seamour sinks - with de Lutz . curled up like a baby with blue lips and the beginnings of hypothermia. The U.S. Coast Guard rescue team that piloted the H60 Jayhawk helicopter that plucked the three men to safety out of the water . Tye . meanwhile is astonished by the ‘white capped mountains of water surrounding . him’. He surveys the scene which he fully expects will be the last thing he . ever sees. The . book says: ‘One minute a wave towers above the boat; the next minute the vessel . rises to the top, where Ben surveys foam-streaked waves in all directions. ‘He . has never seen such raw power, the absolute height of nature’s fury, and he is . awestruck.’ For . his part Snel realises ‘he is witnessing something only a handful of people on . earth have ever seen’. They . sit there and wait to die - but not before another giant wave sends them . crashing back into water, forcing them to haul themselves and the . near-unconscious de Lutz back onto the raft. It . would be six hours before a C-130 plane sent by the US coast guard found them. Their . SOS beacon had not actually activated, but an older device somehow had. Rescuer . Drew Dazzo had to be lowered 40ft in 80 knot winds, go into the water and swim . to the raft before winching each of the men up to safety. The . book makes clear that for all three men, their experience affected them deeply . and that they will never forget it. In . an interview at the time, Snel put it candidly and said he was haunted by ‘not . just thinking you're dead, but being convinced of it’.","Jean Pierre de Lutz, Rudy Snel and Ben Tye set sail in May 2007 on what they hoped would be a trip of a lifetime across the Atlantic Ocean .

A cluster-balloonist who became the first person to fly the English Channel is taking on the challenge of a lifetime by attempting to cross the entire Atlantic Ocean. Intrepid Jonathan Trappe, 38, plans to fly an incredible 2,500 miles across the pond next summer in a seven foot lifeboat carried by 365 huge helium balloons. And the pilot has harnessed the huge public interest in his previous adventures to launch a $300,000 appeal to crowd-fund online the expensive helium and special UV resistant balloons he will need for his record-breaking flight. Scroll down to watch . Adventurer Jonathan Trappe is aiming to travel across the Atlantic next year attached to a balloon cluster - he is seen her crossing the English Channel in May 2010 . Trappe has invested $170,000 into his Atlantic dream, for which he's been training his whole career, and now he's launching a site so ordinary people can play their part this amazing adventure. The daredevil, from Raleigh, North Carolina, is learning to sail a lifeboat, in case he needs to ditch into the ocean during the danger-filled mission. The unique gondola will have an open roof for take-off but a canopy to protect Trappe from high-altitude winds and frost bite during the crossing. He will fly at between 18,000ft  and 25,000ft, beating his previous world altitude record of 21,600ft, and must fly uninterrupted a distance ten times longer than his previous world record of 230 miles in order to succeed. Daredevil Jonathan Trappe poses with the life raft he plans to use as a gondola on his flight across the Atlantic . The cluster-balloonist who became the first to scale the English Channel in a cluster balloon is taking on the challenge of a lifetime by attempting to cross the Atlantic . The adventurer, who holds records for crossing the Alps, flying the most cluster balloons, and the longest distance, has spent his entire career building up to the momentous expedition. He said: 'I didn't wake up one day and think: 'I'm going to fly across the Atlantic.' 'Every attempt before this was geared towards this flight. I've been training for a long time.' In May 2010 Trappe became famous worldwide when flew from England to Belgium dangling from scores of helium balloons - just like the Disney 'Up' character Carl Fredricksen. Now he is ready to take on the Atlantic, a challenge which has called to balloonists for decades, although five others have died in the process, and none have crossed attached to cluster-balloons. 'It's about living an interesting life - for me as the pilot and those watching,' said Trappe. 'So, one day we can look back and say: 'Humankind were able to pull this off. They did it.'' VIDEO: Yes this is real! Jonathan wants to cluster-balloon the Atlantic... Jonathan Trappe flies over the Alps attached to his balloons on September 11, 2011 in France . Trappe will set off from Maine, USA, and set a course for Paris, France. But he will be at the mercy of the elements, and may land anywhere from Norway to North Africa, or be forced to abort and ditch into the ocean. Four meteorologists will work around the clock from a command centre in Wyoming, USA, to help make sure Trappe arrives safely. 'Weather is the most important element of the whole crossing,' said Trappe. 'Two meterologists will focus on short term weather - what I'm facing immediately and helping to foresee danger or conditions that might put me into the ocean. 'The other two will focus on long term weather patterns, and my overall path to the other side.' Jonathan Trappe in flight over Dover during his attempt at crossing the English Channel flying a cluster balloon on May 28, 2010 in Dover, England . He will take oxygen through tubes in his nose and wear a full oxygen mask once he reaches 25,000 feet. 'To climb I'll drop ballast such as sandbags,' he said. 'I'll be equipped with more food and water than I need so I can discard them too.' If something goes wrong, Trappe will change out of his UV protection suit into a cold water suit, pop enough balloons to bring the gondola close to the water, and attempt to land in the ocean. 'It would spell the end of the record attempt and could kill me,' he admitted. 'There will be no getting back into the air. But at least I'll be in a boat.' Trappe's amazing adventure will be immortalised as a television documentary.","Will attempt to fly from Maine to Paris in his bid to cross the 2,500 mile ocean .

Police shot and wounded an armed suspect who was hiding out in a movie theater in San Diego, sending theatergoers at a Saturday matinee of 'Les Miserables' diving for cover. Officers say Tom Billodeaux, 20, of Escondido, California, pulled a handgun on them after they discovered sitting with 15 other people in the dark theater at Reading Cinemas Carmel Mountain. San Diego police armed with assault rifles stormed the cinema and went theater-to-theater looking for Billodeaux after he allegedly threatened his girlfriend and a bystander with a pistol and then fled into the megaplex. Shooting: Police officers and investigators stand around the scene of a shooting at a San Diego movie theater on Saturday evening that left a suspected gunman critically injured . The terrifying incident, which saw screaming movie patrons hiding behind their seats and fleeing in fear after a gunfire erupted in a move theater bore dark echos the massacre of a late-night screening of 'The Dark Night Rises' in July in Aurora, Colorado. James Holmes allegedly killed 12 people and wounded 58 others after he attacked unsuspecting theatergoers with an AR-15 assault rifle and smoke grenades. Captain Terry McManus told U-T San . Diego that police searched theater by theater and evacuated moviegoers . until two officers spotted Billodeaux in a theater with about 15 others. McManus said the man initially . complied with officers' order to put his hands up, but then he put them . back in his lap and brandished a handgun. He said one of the officers . opened fire. The officers thought their lives were . threatened, he said, 'and more importantly, they thought the lives of . others were in jeopardy.' Crime of passion? Police officers talk with a witness at the Reading Cinemas while police say the potentially deadly scene started from a domestic dispute at a nearby restaurant . Billodeaux was shot in the chest and the arm. He was taken to the hospital in critical condition, though he is expected to survive. No was else was injured. Police say he was sitting apart from the other patrons in the theater - though it was not known how close the nearest bystander was. Later, investigators said they did not believe Billodeaux intended to shoot anyone in the theater and was merely hiding from authorities. Billodeaux became the target of an intense police search after witnesses reported seeing him get into a fight with his girlfriend across the street from a shopping plaza where the Cineplex is located, Lieutenant Ernie Herbert said. Witnesses tried to intervene, but he threatened them with a gun and ran to the shopping plaza. The owner of a business next to the Cineplex said police shut down the shopping center's parking lot and stopped every car to look for the man. Officers with dogs checked each store, while a police helicopter hovered above. Scene: The suspect shot by officers is said to have chased his girlfriend across the mall's parking lot before trying to hide inside the cinema, pictured . 'There were 20 police cars blocking the entrance, then the fire truck and the ambulance rushed in,' Steve Krongard, the owner of the Nickel City arcade, said. 'Then we saw seven cops with what looked like rifles, then paramedics went into the theater.' Herbert said police turned their attention to the Cineplex after learning that an armed man had ducked into the Cineplex. The theater's manager told Krongard the shooting occurred during a screening of 'Les Miserables.' A moviegoer told KGTV the lights suddenly went on during the film and two officers came into the theater with their guns. Another witness told the station that everyone got on the floor and started heading for the exit doors. McManus said the gunman never made any threats to others in the theater. He said the man had left a suicide note at his Escondido home before going to his girlfriend's workplace to confront her. It was the second shooting at a San Diego County movie theater in as many days. A concession worker suffered an arm injury when a shot fired outside a San Marcos movie theater went through the lobby window and struck her, sheriff's officials said. The shooting occurred during a fight in the parking lot at Edwards San Marcos Stadium 18 and triggered a large police response because authorities were initially not sure whether there was a shooter inside the Cineplex. No arrests have been reported after the San Marcos shooting.","Tom Billodeaux, 20, allegedly assaulted his girlfriend in a parking lot near the theater and pulled a gun on a bystander who tired to help .

The wife of the $1m lottery winner who died of cyanide poisoning a day after collecting his jackpot today denied killing him - as a police source claims that she did not share his final meal. Shabana Ansari frowned and told MailOnline: ‘No, certainly not’, when asked on Thursday if she was responsible for the death of Urooj Khan. Meanwhile, a Chicago police source has claimed that she did not share his last dinner, the traditional Indian Kofta curry she prepared at their home in Chicago. Scroll down for video . Distressed: Mr Khan's wife Shabana Ansari outside the home she shared with him on Thursday morning . Tough: Mrs Khan said today in the laundry store her husband owned that he was her 'courage and strength'. It was also revealed today that her father Fareeden Ansari, right, owed $124,000 in unpaid taxes . Urooj’s 17-year-old daughter Jasmeen, who lived with them, did not touch the meal either, the source told MailOnline. A short time later, Urooj started screaming as the cyanide tore through his body, causing him an agonizing and horrific death. Asked about the final meal, Shabana said: ‘I don’t want to comment on the curry. I am fed up with all this. When I say something people are misquoting it so I don’t want to comment.’ Her comments seem to refer an interview with the Chicago Sun-Times earlier in the week in which she said that she had if fact eaten the meal. She added that when she reads claims she could have been involved in her husband’s death 'I don't focus on it because I have not much to focus on, so I really don't care about those things’. She said: 'It is a very difficult time. I've lost him. 'It's tough without him, it's really tough because he was my support and he was my courage and he was my strength.' In another twist the Chicago Tribune today reported that her father Fareedun Ansari, who was living with them too, owed $124,000 in unpaid taxes and that as a result the IRS had taken out a lien on the property they were all sharing. When MailOnline asked him about the money, Shabana intervened and said: 'We don't want to comment on this right now'. Urooj, 46, died on July 20 last year the day after he collected the oversized check from Illinois State Lottery officials at the 7-Eleven where he bought the winning scratchcard. Cruel death: Urooj Khan (pictured right) with his $1million winnings shortly before his death from cyanide poisoning. His wife Shabana Ansari (left) and his teenage daughter from an earlier marriage Jasmeen (second left) are by his side . He could not stop smiling and told the cameras he was going to use the money to pay bills, donate to St. Jude's Children's Hospital in Chicago and grow his dry-cleaning business which he had worked all his life to build up. After taxes, the prize money amounted to $425,000 as he took it in a lump sum. When Urooj died, the initial toxicology tests did not find anything suspicious. It was not until a relative asked the Cook County Medical Examiner to take another look that the cyanide was found and the death was ruled a homicide. Urooj’s body is expected to be exhumed in the coming weeks to carry out further analysis. Shabana, 32, who moved to the US from India after marrying Urooj 12 years ago, was questioned by police for four hours and according to her lawyer Steven Kozicki ‘has nothing to hide’. Investigators also searched her home but do not appear to have found anything incriminating. No arrests have been made so far. The police source confirmed to MailOnline that Shabana did not eat the meal but did not elaborate on whether or not she watched as her husband ate it. Legal battle: Meraj Khan (right) launched a legal battle to win custody of her late brother's 17-year-old daughter from an earlier marriage Jasmeen (center). Unidentified woman, left. In a potential source of tension in the family, the Chicago Tribune reported that Fareedun owed the $124,000 in unpaid taxes because of a small business he owned that appears to have failed . James Pittacora, who represents Fareedun, said that Urooj had helped pay for the business and that the two men were ‘very close’. He said: ‘They had a very good relationship, and he and his daughter are devastated’. Relatives have told MailOnline that, in a further sign of his generous character, Urooj took Fareedun into his home when he got sick a few years ago and urged him to move to Chicago from New Jersey to be with them. The relative said: ‘Fareedun wasn’t well so Urooj took him in. All four of them lived together and Fareedun got well again. He was well looked after’. The developments come after Urooj’s family went to war with Shabana amid claims she tried to cash the winning cheque in the days after his death. Foul play: A family member called police to say Khan had not suffered a 'natural death' after he had been buried. His body will now be exhumed to inspect the contents of his last meal . Urooj’s brother ImTiaz Khan has alleged in probate documents that Shabana attempted to claim the windfall ‘shortly’ after his demise but for some reason was unable to. ImTiaz also claimed his late brother and his wife were not even married, meaning that she could miss out on the 50 per cent of the lottery prize she would otherwise be entitled to. In response, Miss Ansari filed documents of her own which stated she was indeed married to Urooj and the court agreed, making her the administrator of the estate. In another sign the family are tearing themselves apart, Urooj’s sister Meraj Khan launched a separate legal bid to take guardianship of his daughter from his first marriage, Jasmeen. Meraj successfully got custody of the 17-year-old even though she appears to have lived with Shabana, her step mother, most of her life. Agony: The day after receiving a check for his winnings, Khan awoke screaming in pain in his bed at his Chicago home (pictured). An expert said this is caused when muscle contract suddenly as the poison kills you 'cell by cell' And as a result of the filings, the jackpot was frozen and will remain so for another three months. The remaining three months will allow family members to make their case to the lawyer organising how the funds will be handed out - normally it is 50 per cent to the spouse and 50 per cent to the children, unless there are grounds for a complaint. Entrepreneur: Khan emigrated to the U.S. during the 1980s, and had saved enough to open three dry cleaning shops (pictured) on Chicago's Far North side . Speaking to the Chicago Tribune, Urooj’s sister Meraj Khan and her husband Mohammed Zaman said that the deceased was selfless and donated to an orphanage in his native India. Zaman said that Urooj would turn up unannounced for coffee, was a keen cricket player and loved bringing presents to birthday parties for children in the family. He said: ‘There is a way to go, a natural way. ‘We are born, we die. Not homicide. I don't want to see him a victim.’ Calls to Miss Ansari’s lawyer went unreturned.","Mr Khan, 46, died at Chicago home with his 32-year-old wife just weeks after winning $1million .

The bizarre plan is being considered by the Honours Forfeiture Committee because knighthoods cannot be removed from people who have died. Those given a knighthood are awarded lifetime membership to a ‘living order’ and the title no longer exists when the holder dies. A constitutional bar preventing the dead from having their knighthoods removed means the government's forfeiture committee cannot strip Savile of the accolade . A Whitehall source told The Sunday Times: 'The forfeiture committee is certainly looking at the issue.' The TV host, who died last year aged 84, was knighted in the Queen’s Birthday Honours list in 1990 - an award which followed the OBE he was given for services to charity and broadcasting in 1971. The Queen has the power to remove honours after they have been recommended by the forfeiture committee. Last year Fred Goodwin, former chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland, was stripped of his knighthood. Paedophile: Jimmy Saville who was awarded a knighthood in 1990 for 'charitable services' A report published this week by Scotland . Yard and NSPCC said he DJ spent ‘every waking minute’ thinking about . abusing children and used his celebrity status to that end. Eighteen . girls and ten boys aged under ten were abused – the youngest being a boy . of eight targeted at his school. Allegations of sexual assault have been made by 450 individuals, aged up to 47, and some have yet to be interviewed. The 214 confirmed offences included 34 rapes and stretch across 28 police force areas. The most recent was in 2009 but they date back as far as 1955. Lawyers for the victims have already instigated compensation claims against the BBC, NHS and education authorities for failing to stop the serial predator. The payouts could run into millions of pounds. Victims said it was shocking it had taken so long to expose the DJ’s predatory behaviour. They said senior managers who missed opportunities to stop him should be named and shamed.","An OBE or knighthood expires when a person dies but title 'Sir' is still used .

"By . Peter Hitchens . PUBLISHED: . 20:58 EST, 8 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 21:14 EST, 8 December 2012 . In a large part of this country, it is against the law to fly the Union Flag from government buildings for 348 days of the year. This has been so since the year 2000. As a special treat, it can be flown for the other 17 days. The rest of the time the flagpole stays bare. The place where this law operates is Northern Ireland.  I wonder how much longer we shall be able to fly our national flag in the rest of the United Kingdom, or even how much longer that flag will exist at all. I think this is a shocking fact. I am one of the few British journalists who bothered to read the so-called ‘Good Friday’ Agreement under which this country capitulated to the gangsters of the Provisional IRA, under American pressure. 'No surrender': Protestors wave Union Flags in front of Belfast's City Hall earlier this week after the Union flag was removed from the building . I know that we released hundreds of grisly criminals, destroyed our security apparatus and withdrew the Army in return for various unsigned and unenforceable promises from Sinn Fein and the IRA. But even I did not know that this was one of its effects. Our national flag, you see, might offend someone. That is also the excuse for its recent removal from Belfast City Hall, which has led to so much bitterness and turmoil in that city. But the reality is this. You haul down your flag when you surrender. And it was a surrender.  I was amused to see that Mrs Hillary Clinton, that nasty hard Leftist now aiming for the White House, had her vote-winning visit to Northern Ireland spoiled by the flag riots on Friday. How can you have riots and peace? The great pretence, that giving in to organised crime brings peace, was for once exposed. Northern Ireland’s poor and weak have never been so subject to intimidation and gangsterism, and I wonder if I will live to see the (sadly inevitable) day when Irish troops are putting down Orange riots on the Protestant Shankill Road, probably caused by illegal displays of the old Union Flag. Peace, indeed. The squalid history of this event is a warning we refuse to heed and which is barely known here.I saw it happen, in Washington DC, astonished by the brusque and scornful treatment of my country by a nation I had foolishly seen as an ally. I remember one very senior White House official letting  slip to me that she thought of Britain as a sort of Serbia, just another place to intervene in, as Syria is now. I have laughed at the phrase ‘Special Relationship’ ever since. I followed Sinn Fein’s Gerry Adams round the USA, as this coffin-faced apologist for violence and terror was feted and adulated by Americans who would have shrunk from him had he spoken for any other cause but the Irish one. I annoyed him so much with my inconvenient questions  that he publicly said I should  be ‘decommissioned’ and –  on the one occasion we were ever alone together –  showed me his less diplomatic, less humorous side. What was this about? Mrs Clinton’s husband Bill needed working-class Roman Catholic votes to win the White House, votes his party had lost by backing abortion. So he discovered the Irish cause, about which he knew  little and (I suspect) cared less. He also took a lot of Irish-American campaign money. In 1993, Irish America, which these days means some very big business, tired of waiting for results and demanded action. And so he acted, and so we were forced to make a shameful peace with the IRA, and haul down our flag over part of our own territory. By the time the whole thing’s finished, St Patrick’s Cross will have to come out of that flag, and the harp will depart from the Royal Standard. I think that when countries suffer defeats, they should admit to them and grieve over them, not pretend they have won. That way lie more defeats and more humiliations. I am glad Kate Winslet has pulled out of the latest propaganda campaign against anti-drug laws, a documentary by Sir Richard Branson’s son, Sam, called Breaking The Taboo. Breaking The Taboo: Kate Winslet briefly featured in a YouTube Clip promoting a new documentary on drugs . Far too many celebrities and politicians . have been beguiled by the case for surrender. Sir Richard himself (who . was barely coherent  in a drugs debate I had with him on Channel 4 News . last Thursday)  is one of them. Whose interests do they serve? I can only assume that they simply don’t understand what they are doing, or the dangers they are playing with. A request to any prominent person asked  to back this campaign: arrange a visit to the locked wards of Britain’s mental hospitals, and ask the relatives of their occupants what they think caused the problem. Why are we such cringing serfs about tax? Our money belongs to us. It isn’t pocket money from the State, but our own. If they want it, they should prove they know what to do with it. What evidence is there that the Government, that incompetent waster, would spend money better than Starbucks? Who do you think would pay in the end, if Starbucks paid more tax  – why, the customers. Even Leftist politicians are careful not to pay too much tax when (for instance) they inherit property. Leftie BBC journalists are fond of (legal) arrangements to keep their tax low. Why should coffee shops be expected to behave differently? It is strange how muted is the TV coverage of the descent of Egypt into Islamist despotism,  and the brutal behaviour of the new regime to protesters. Compare this with the euphoric, uncritical coverage of the original Cairo ‘Spring’. As this doomed, overrated event repeatedly proves the pessimists right, can we learn nothing? No. The world’s media are still promoting an intervention in Syria, where we will replace bad with worse, at a cost of many lives. Last weekend, almost every BBC radio bulletin I listened to, over several days, mentioned a petition calling for full implementation of the Leveson Report into the press, and said that the number of signatures was rising. Unless they can show that they have ever  done this with any other comparable petition,  I believe this is objective evidence of BBC bias on a matter of public controversy. Will the BBC Trust act? Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Under the 'Good Friday' agreement, flying the Union Flag is illegal in Northern Ireland on 348 days of the year ."

Jackie Carrizosa, who spent a month teaching RiRi how to hold guns and talk like a Navy officer in order to convincingly play her character, has said that the singer was even tougher than her stunt double. The 22-year-old was drafted in to help out on set after director Peter Berg spotted her playing football with the US Navy. Big guns: Former US Naval petty officer, Jacqueline Carrizosa who is the inspiration behind singer Rihanna's character on her big screen debut . Made of tough stuff: Rihanna was deeply impressed by Jackie, and did all she could to recreate her gun-ho attitude when filming . Jackie told The Sun: 'We were on set from sunrise to sunset — Rihanna was really tough. She was way better than her stunt double. She’s not afraid to get bruised or cut.' She added that Rihanna hugely enjoyed handling guns. Jackie said: 'When it was time to shoot I told her not to be nervous and to have fun with it. When she finished she was grinning from ear to ear and said, ‘I see why you love this stuff’.' Caught the director's eye: The 22-year-old was drafted in to help out on set after Peter Berg spotted her playing football with the US Navy . Inspiration: Rihanna has said that she based her character for Battleship on her mentor . 'I showed her how to hold the gun so she’d look a little more professional. And there is one scene where she was dragging one of the guys out and I helped her out with how to pick him up. ' Jackie admitted that since she doesn't watch television she was only vaguely aware of Rihanna as a  pop star before she met her, but that Berg persuaded her to join the film when he sent her a message after watching her play football. Rihanna came to base her entire character on Jackie. Tomboy: Jackie encouraged RiRi to throw herself into the physical aspects of the role without holding back . Star student: Jackie says Rihanna was really tough, and even better than her stunt double . This was encouraged by director .

She’s fearless and she’s one of the boys and it’s really fun to explore that.'

The parents of a dyslexic boy are suing one of Britain's top independent prep schools after claiming he was relentlessly bullied for two years. Wealthy property developer Paul McDonnell, 49, and his wife Angela, 46, claim their son Patrick was repeatedly labelled 'thick' by other pupils at the  £15,000-a-year Bilton Grange School in Dunchurch, Warwickshire. They claim Patrick, now 11, was subjected to two years of abuse which included being punched, kicked and threatened by his classmates. Furious:  Angela and Paul McDonnell, left, are suing one of Britain's top independent prep schools after claiming their dyslexic son Patrick McDonnell, right,  was relentlessly bullied for two years . On one occasion a pupil wrote 'Patrick is dim and thick' with a stick in snow in the grounds of the school - whose past pupils include Olympic ceremony rapper Taio Cruz. Mrs McDonnell, who runs her own floristry business, claims four other pupils were also withdrawn by their parents after suffering a catalogue of violence and bullying at the school which caters for 308 pupils aged 4-13. The couple withdrew Patrick from the £15,000-a-year school two weeks into the Lent term in February 2011. But when they asked the school to refund the £5,225 in fees they had paid in advance the headteacher refused. In May last year the couple were ordered to pay a further £5,225 for last year's summer term even though Patrick had already enrolled at a new school. They are now suing the school in the Small Claims Court in a bid to claw back the money. Unhappy: Mr McDonnell and his wife removed their son Patrick from posh Bilton Grange School in Dunchurch, Warwickshire, after claiming he was repeatedly labelled 'thick' by other pupils . Mrs McDonnell today accused teachers of turning a blind eye to bullying - adding that one parent told her it was 'an accepted way of life' at the school. She said: 'There were four actual incidents when Patrick was punched and kicked. 'Two years prior to that he had been verbally bullied and they never acted on it. 'We had incidents where Patrick had a football punched out of his arms and a little boy said ""I'm going to punch your lights out"". 'There was another incident where a child had written ""Patrick is dim and thick"" in the snow on the playground. 'Both me and Paul went to see the teacher and then the head and they said they were going to make his life easier and deal with it but they obviously didn't. 'We wanted to take him out and put him in another school and forget about it but then in May they came to us looking for the next term's fees. Close: The McDonnell family are pictured on holiday in Murcia, Spain in April 2012. Angela and husband Paul are seen with sons Rory, left, and Patrick, right . 'They wouldn't back down and said we had not given them sufficient notice to withdraw Patrick, that's when I got an educational solicitor. 'One parent who removed their child from the school said ""it's an institution where bullying is an accepted way of life"".' The couple will take their case to the small claims court at a date to be fixed later this year. Mr McDonnell added: 'We've said that if we win we will donate the money to beat bullying charities. 'It's never been about money, it's about exposing the school. 'Whether we win or lose, we have always said we have done the right thing morally.' They claim four other parents also removed their children from the school which charges up to £19,245 a year for a full boarder. Mr and Mrs McDonnell, whose other son Rory, eight, attends a state school in Coventry, claim one girl was assaulted with a cricket bat and left needing crutches after a brutal attack by another pupil. Bilton Grange - which is seen as a feeder school for Eton and posh Marlborough College - has a number of high-profile alumni including London-born R&B singer-songwriter Taio Cruz. The pop star has since become an anti-bullying campaigner. The 27-year-old revealed he was relentlessly bullied as a child at school and often took refuge in the music room but he was not specific about whether it took place at Bilton Grange. On the school's website, it describes itself as 'a co-educational, boarding and day preparatory school for children aged four to thirteen with a special atmosphere that sets it apart from many good prep schools.' The school was rated 'outstanding' in an Ofsted inspection in June 2011. A spokesperson for the school, said today: 'We take any allegations of bullying at Bilton Grange extremely seriously, and there are robust and comprehensive procedures in place to ensure any such allegations are investigated thoroughly and swiftly. 'The complaints raised by Mr and Mrs McDonnell were assessed and dealt with appropriately. 'On assessing the complaints by Mr & Mrs McDonnell, Warwickshire Safeguarding Children Board commented that: ""the school acted appropriately, reasonably and made a number of offers relating to additional supervision and monitoring of the issues the parents raised. 'Unfortunately the parents withdrew the child, not enabling these measures to take place.  (the school) has been visited when children have been present and found the atmosphere good with excellent systems in place to respond to any bullying issues.’ 'Routine inspections of the school by Ofsted and the Independent Schools Inspectorate, concluded that there are proactive and effective strategies in place to guard against bullying, and that parents and children at the school trust and feel satisfied with the pastoral care and guidance provided.'","Paul and Angela McDonnell are suing Bilton Grange School .

Hundreds of visitors braved stormy conditions to watch the panda play in his enclosure. Look at me! The five-month old bear does a roly poly over a branch on his first pubic display at San Diego Zoo . Adorable: The giant panda cub Xiao Liwi laps up the attention . The 16-pund male cub made sure it was worth the money as he climbed a tree and posed for photos. It was a far cry from his pre-opening introduction to the media and zoo volunteers when he rolled in mud and hay, ignored visitors and then climbed into a moat at the edge of the enclosure and fell asleep on his face. He woke up once the public arrived and poured on the charm. Giant pandas are endangered, and experts estimate there are fewer than 1,600 in the wild, all in the mountain forests of central China. Xiao Liwu (pronounced zhai lee-woo), which means little gift, was born on July 29 to Bai Yun, the zoo's 21-year-old, 223-pound adult female panda. He is her sixth cub, one of five with mate Gao Gao.

Despite . stormy weather and cool temperatures, hundreds of panda fans lined up . for the two-hour viewing. Previous glimpses of the cub and its mother . were restricted to observations through the zoo's PandaCam. Bai Yun is one of only two captive pandas worldwide to give birth at age 20, relatively old for pandas. Fewer than a dozen pandas have been born at U.S. zoos, including a female cub that died at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., in September, making Bai Yun the most prolific breeder in captivity outside China. Bai Yun mostly ignored the baby during the public display. She chomped on bamboo, taking a break only to get a drink of water while the cub played in a nearby tree. 'With the first cub or two, she was very attentive, but the last, she doesn't worry about them at all,' said Vivian Kiss, a panda fan. 'You just want to pick him up and hold him.' The cub, roughly the size of a stick of . butter when first born, is still nursing and does not yet eat solid . food.

Holed up: Julian Assange wants diplomatic guarantees he won't be pursued by the U.S. for publishing secret documents . WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has called for diplomatic guarantees he will not be pursued by the U.S. for publishing secret documents if he goes to Sweden to face allegations of sex assault. The Australian, 40, said he is prepared to go to Sweden to face questioning over the claims, but fears Stockholm will turn him over to the U.S. where he could face espionage and conspiracy charges over revelations by WikiLeaks. Speaking to the Sydney Morning Herald from the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he suddenly arrived seeking a last-ditch bid for political asylum last Tuesday, he said: 'Ultimately it may be a matter of what guarantees the United Kingdom, the United States and Sweden are willing to provide'. Mr Assange believes Washington will pursue him after WikiLeaks published a cache of sensitive documents, including about the Afghan and Iraq wars, and thousands of diplomatic cables which have embarrassed governments worldwide. He said: 'For example, if the US were to guarantee (it would) drop the grand jury investigation and any further investigation of WikiLeaks publishing activity, that would be an important guarantee... diplomatic commitments do have some weight.' Mr Assange has been holed up in the Ecuador embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden following the failure of a bid to re-open an appeal against his removal from the country. Mr Assange is friendly with the South American country's socialist leader Rafael Correa and embassies are regarded as 'safe havens' which British police cannot enter. Veteran journalist John Pilger last week said the Ecuadorians were being very hospitable and had provided Mr Assange with a 'fairly big room with a computer' although he would not confirm whether he had been given a bed for his stay. Ecuador says he is under its protection while it considers the asylum application. He faces arrest for breaching the terms of his bail if he leaves the Knightsbridge building. Today a letter signed by high profile campaigner Michael Moore and film director Oliver Stone calling for Julian Assange to be granted asylum was handed into the embassy. Robert Naiman, director of Just Foreign Policy - an American organisation dedicated to reforming U.S foreign policy - gave the Ecuadorian Consul Fidel Narvaez on the steps of the Hans St embassy just after 4.30pm. Mr Naiman said those who had signed the letter, including radical academic Noam Chomsky and actor Danny Glover, were concerned about Mr Assange’s fate if his application is rejected. 'Our concern is that if Julian is sent to Sweden that the government of Sweden maybe send him to the United States where he may be prosecuted under the Espionage Act' Mr Naiman said. 'Many people in the United States are very concerned about this, are very concerned about Julian and the US campaign and hopefully president Correa can give him a positive decision in this case'. Protection: A British police officer patrols outside the Ecuadorian embassy in Knightsbridge, London this weekend where Mr Assange is under protection after suddenly arriving last Tuesday . Protest: Supporters of Julian Assange demonstrate outside the Ecuadorian Embassy last week, where the Wikileaks founder has sought political asylum since suddenly arriving last Tuesday . Accepting the documents, Mr Narvaez said 'Mr Assange is under the protection of the Ecuadorian state, as you know. '(The letter) will be sent to president Correa...we will make sure he get’s it.' Over the weekend, the Ecuadorian . Ambassador left London to return to her home country for talks on the . bid. Anna Alban is to meet President Correa in the capital Quito, where . she will . personally brief him on the situation. Speaking after visiting Assange today, Mr Naiman said Mr Assange was in 'good spirits' despite living in 'modest' surroundings. 'My sense is that Julian is used to simple living,' said Mr Naiman. 'I'd say he is living now as I did when I was an undergraduate in college - in what looked to me like a study that's been converted into a makeshift bedroom that's still functioning as a study and workspace.' Asked whether Assange was sleeping on an inflatable mattress, Mr Naiman said: 'I won't deny that it's an inflatable bed.' WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson, who also visited Mr Assange today, said 'little had changed' regarding the asylum application. Mr Hrafnsson said: 'The Ecuadorian government has requested material both from Julian and from authorities in Sweden, the UK and US before they make a formal decision.' Mr Hrafnsson said reports that the Swedish Government had ruled out guaranteeing Mr Assange won't be extradited to the United States were of 'grave concern'. 'I don't have understanding whether this is the official position of the Swedish government, but it's of grave concern,' he added. However, he said Mr Assange was in 'good spirits' and keeping busy, adding: 'He's working, doing what we are supposed to be doing, Wikileaks.' Discussion: The Ecuador ambassador Ana Alban, left, has now gone back to Ecuador to discuss Mr . Assange's claim for political asylum. He has criticised Australian PM Julia Gillard, right, over the handling of his case . Meanwhile, Mr Assange, who wants to . start a new life in the South American country, has again criticised . Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard over Canberra's handling of his . case. The . former computer hacker said his situation was 'a serious political . matter... (that) the Australian government should treat with the . seriousness it requires'. He said: 'I have been attacked by the . U.S., from the vice president down, as a high-tech terrorist, and by . the Swedish prime minister and foreign minister -- surely that requires . some direct response from the Gillard government.' Mr Assange . has said he chose Ecuador's embassy instead of his home country's . because he felt Canberra had done nothing to protect him, a charge the . government has denied. Assange's bid to avoid extradition has left his celebrity backers, including socialist Jemima Khan, facing an embarrassing £240,000 financial headache . Canberra has said it has limited capacity to help him because he is not in Australia and has not broken any Australian laws. Australia has also dismissed the idea . that Washington is keen to get Mr Assange, with Foreign Minister Bob . Carr saying Sunday there was 'no hint' of a plan to extradite him to the . U.S. Last week, Ecuador's . President said the South American nation would have to consider 'whether . Assange's life is at stake', as it makes it decision on asylum. President Correa told BBC Mundo the country 'defends the right to live'. President Correa also said: 'We are analysing Julian Assange's asylum request in a very serious and responsible way. We can't give an official response until the analysis of his request is complete.' Mr Assange requested political asylum under the UN Human Rights Declaration, ironic given Ecuador's poor record on human rights and free speech. He is set to be extradited to . Sweden, where he faces accusations of raping a woman and sexually . molesting and coercing another in Stockholm in August 2010 while on a . visit to give a lecture. Mr Assange says the sex was consensual and the allegations against him are politically motivated. Meanwhile, his bid to avoid . extradition has left his celebrity backers, including socialist Jemima . Khan, facing an embarrassing £240,000 financial headache after they . stumped up the cash to keep him out of jail. Asked on Twitter whether she was 'on the hook' for his breach of bail, she replied: 'Yes. I had expected him to face the allegations. I am as surprised as anyone by this.' Bianca Jagger, film-makers Michael Moore and Ken Loach, and journalists John Pilger and Tariq Ali were among those who offered to support Mr Assange's bail while he fought a legal battle to avoid being sent to Sweden. Those who did stand surety for Mr Assange – freed on bail in December 2010 after spending nine days in Wandsworth jail when held under a European arrest warrant issued by the Swedes – risked losing their money the minute he walked into the embassy, just yards from Harrods.","The Australian is prepared to go to Sweden to face questioning over sex assault allegations .

Liz McIntosh, 64, was tending her flock in the Northumberland National Park when her machine crashed and it may have been some time before the alarm was raised on Friday afternoon. The accident happened on an unnamed road  near Elsdon in Northumberland, where she looked after a flock of 700 sheep and cattle with the help of a part-time shepherd. John Hartshorne, chairman of Otterburn Parish Council, said: ‘She had stock to deal with and at this time of year farmers are charging around the hillsides on quad bikes. ‘You might say everybody is to some extent at risk if they are out on the hills and people don’t know where they are if something happens. ‘That’s the sort of environment she was working in - upland hill farming, isolated, cold.’ Mr Hartshorne, who runs Albion Outdoors which gets young people out into the countryside to study nature, said Ms McIntosh was a keen naturalist. The important 10,000-year-old peat bog known as Steng Moss was part of her land, and she allowed his students access to learn about it, he said. ‘She was well-informed, a very good naturalist and very good with birds,’ he said. Ms McIntosh, the daughter of a surgeon who studied geography at Newcastle University, was understood to be divorced. Her friend and neighbour Barbara Foti told the Sunday Sun newspaper: ‘She was very strong, very tough and enjoyed what she did.

An Olympics spectator who hurled a beer bottle at the start of the men’s 100m final got into the stadium without a valid ticket, a court heard yesterday. Ashley Gill-Webb, 34, evaded layers of tight security designed to prevent a terror attack to reach exclusive seats close to the start line, it was said. He is believed to have used an old ticket to trick officials into letting him enter the Olympic Park and the stadium, where he was able to reach the £4,000 seats without being stopped. 'Disruption': Ashley Gill-Webb, pictured left with a supporter outside Stratford Magistrates Court, admits throwing a bottle during the build-up to the 100m final . Moments before the start of the blue riband event of the Olympics, he screamed abuse at Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt, then hurled a green Heineken bottle towards the athletes as they sprinted out of the blocks. Father-of-two Gill-Webb, from South Milford near Leeds, later admitted throwing the bottle, but claimed he ‘was in the grips of a manic episode’ when he did so. When police initially arrested him he pretended to be Scottish actor Alan Cumming, who appeared in the James Bond film Goldeneye and the X-Men films, and claimed a Dutch spectator had thrown the bottle. Details of his bizarre behaviour emerged on the opening day of his trial at Stratford magistrates’ court, which is close to the Olympic Stadium in east London. He later explained that he gave the name of the Scottish actor as many people say that he looks like him, the court heard. He is accused of using threatening words or behaviour with intent to cause harassment, alarm or distress. He denies the charge. Bolt was not distracted and went on to win the race in 9.63 seconds, the second-fastest 100m ever. Gill-Webb, who was in the midst of the Dutch Olympic team, was confronted by judo bronze medallist Edith Bosch and restrained by volunteers before being arrested, the court was told. In a statement read to the court, Miss Bosch described how Gill-Webb, who had ‘slurred speech’ and ‘glassy’ eyes, pushed past her to get to the front. She said: ‘He was shouting specifically at Usain Bolt. Things like: “Usain I want you to lose. Usain you are bad. You are an a*******”.’ Hushed anticipation: A bottle lands on the track yards from Usain Bolt, far left, after being thrown by Ashley Gill-Webb, circled top . She said a volunteer asked Gill-Webb to return to his seat which made him angry. Miss Bosch then saw ‘the man in front of me move his arm back behind his head and then forwards in a throwing motion. I then saw a bottle hit the track.’ As he started to move away, she confronted him. Miss Bosch said she was 'flabbergasted' at what she had witnessed, saying: 'such behaviour is so inappropriate', and added: 'I was sad to miss the 100m.' Miss Bosch added: ‘I was angry with what he had done which was so disrespectful.’ After the event, she wrote on Twitter: ‘A drunken spectator threw a bottle on to the track! I HAVE BEATEN HIM . . . unbelievable.’ Gill-Webb was originally due to stand trial in September, but this was abandoned after he was sectioned under the Mental Health Act. He admits being abusive and throwing the bottle, but claims his mental illness prevented him from understanding the effect his actions would have on others. Dr Richard Latham, a consultant psychiatrist called by the prosecution, said Gill-Webb must have been aware what he was doing when he slipped past security into a £4,000-a-ticket area of the Olympic Stadium. 'He made the decision to go to the Olympic Park, he thought about it and made the decision to go there', he said. Opening the case at Stratford Magistrates' Court in east London yesterday, prosecutor Neil King told the court the Games had reached a highlight with the men's 100m final. He said: 'In the stadium, along with the many thousands who should have been there legitimately and were watching the race in hushed anticipation, was also Mr Gill-Webb who, it is now accepted, was unwell at the time. Claim: Gill-Webb allegedly told police he was the actor Alan Cummings . 'His conduct at the time, however, the Crown say, was one that was causing harassment, alarm and distress to those around him, and his conduct was one that he intended to cause harassment, alarm and distress. 'He had somehow, without a ticket ever being found on him, made his way into very exclusive seats indeed.  He was mingling with members of the Dutch Olympic team.  Indeed he would be within striking distance of a bronze medallist Ms Edith Bosch. 'Whilst there he hurled abuse towards the athletes in the final, particularly towards the eventual winner Usain Bolt.' 'He threw a green Heineken bottle in a lobbing motion that was captured on CCTV. This bottle landed extremely close to the athletes and it's probably luck rather than Mr Gill-Webb's judgment that it did not do anything far more serious.' Mr King said: 'His conduct, that is to say the shouting and jostling, had already alarmed and disrupted those around him but throwing the bottle was a step even further and led to confrontation with Ms Bosch.' Fellow witnesses described seeing Gill-Webb shouting at the finalists, hurling insults at Bolt, fellow Jamaican sprinter Yohan Blake, and US sprinter Justin Gatlin. Student Farzin Mirshahi said she heard him yell: 'Believe in Blake, no Usain.' Her brother Kiya Mirshahi, also a student, said he heard Gill-Webb shout: 'Usain, no, Justin you are a druggie, believe in Blake, no Usain, no.' Ashley Gill-Webb, seen left arriving at court, was challenged by Dutch judo champion Edith Bosch, right . He told the court: 'He was very vocal about the athletes as they competed, and kept leaving his seat and coming back again, standing in the aisles. 'At no point did he ever try to explain himself or deny what I had seen, but just demanded to know who had won the race' 'He was trying to get to the front to be closer to the athetes.' Security guard Robert Spears saw Gill-Webb jostling his way through the Dutch fans and then saw him throw a bottle towards the starting blocks. Winner: Usain Bolt of Jamaica celebrates winning gold in the race, despite the bottle being thrown at the start . 'I feared at this point that he was going to disrupt the Games,' his statement, which was read to the court, said, and he described grabbing Gill-Webb with another member of staff and escorting him from the stadium. 'At no point did he ever try to explain himself or deny what I had seen, but just demanded to know who had won the race,' Mr Spears said. Gill-Webb's DNA was found on the bottle, and CCTV footage was due to be shown to the court of him jostling Dutch fans and athletes shortly before throwing it. The case continues.

The seemingly constant problem in air travel in the U.S. isn't just an inconvenience, one study found that it drains $40 billion from the economy every year. A group of academics ran computer simulations on six million flights at over 300 airports in 2010 to determine how each delay spreads throughout the entire system and causes further problems. Slowdown: The computer simulation shows scattered flight delays across the U.S. The knock-on effect: Three days later, the number of flight delays has increased and spread coast to coast . Better days: This chart shows one day where air travel was relatively on-time . The researchers, led by Pablo Fleurquin from the Institute for Cross-Disciplinary Physics and Complex Systems in Spain, used computer models that are similar to how the spread of diseases or wildfire are monitored. Their paper, published today, has the potential to help . airlines change their schedules in advance to anticipate and prevent . delays before they happen. The worst contributor to delays is flight crews and . passengers missing their connecting flights, which makes sense since a . plane cannot takeoff if its pilot isn't available. Flight crews and passengers that are delayed from another flight is the greatest contributor to spreading delays nationwide. Airport congestion prevents flights from taking off because too many planes are competing for runways. Scheduling connecting flights without enough time between legs. Weather and labor problems also spread delays but not as seriously. The other two main problems are schedules that are too tight and airport congestion. The scheduling issue occurs when one leg of a connecting flight is unable to land on time, throwing a wrench into other scheduled takeoffs. And congestion at runways creates more delays because many airports . cannot handle the amount of planes that need to take off at a given time. The study showed that problems like . bad weather and labor disruptions aren't as significant in spreading . delays since they tend to occur in smaller clusters and don't create . system-wide headaches. It . also demonstrated how the problems typically do not have lasting effects . from one day to the other since the causes of delays begin again each . day.

A teenage gunman brought terror to a California high school today after he shot a fellow student before being talked down by a heroic teacher. The shooting is the first at a school since the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut less than one month ago. The shooter, who was carrying up to 20 rounds of ammunition for his 12-gauge shotgun, fired at a second student but missed before a teacher persuaded him to lay down his weapon. The name of the victim has not been . released, but he is said to be in critical condition after having . surgery for a shotgun wound to the shoulder. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Injured: One student at Taft Union High School in Taft, California was shot in the shoulder and airlifted to a nearby hospital after another student armed with a shotgun aimed for him . Anxious: Concerned parents rushed to the school shortly after the shooter was detained around 9.20am Thursday . ‘When (the teacher) started a dialogue the shotgun was pointed in a lot of different directions,’ Sheriff Donny Youngblood said at a Thursday afternoon press conference. As the teacher was trying to urge students to exit through a back door to the classroom, a community supervisor arrived on the scene and helped calm the shooter before he was detained by police. ‘As the dialogue started with him and the campus supervisor, the student was still armed with the shotgun... they distracted him,’ Mr Youngblood said. Damage: Two other students reportedly suffered minor injuries in the race to get out of the building, with this girl being transported to hospital after having hearing damage from being so close to the shooter . ‘The heroics of these two people- it goes without saying... speaks volumes for these two young men and what they could have prevented.’ None of the individuals directly involved have been named, but only one person sustained serious injuries from the incident. The teacher refused medical attention on the scene even though he was struck in the head by a pellet from the shotgun. During the complicated process of exiting the school, one student sustained minor injuries and another had to go to a hospital because she allegedly was standing near the shooter and may have hearing problems as a result. Official word: Taft Police Chief Ed Whiting talked to the parents who came to the school after the shooting started in the Taft Union High School science building around 9am on Thursday . Emergency response: Local and federal officials immediately responded to the shooting and went room by room to inspect the school after they apprehended the suspect . Many students in the building immediately called 911 or their parents as soon as they heard shots fired around 9am, so the police response was extremely quick. The sheriff said that two emergency units were on the scene within one minute of the calls. After the teacher talked the shooter down, he was taken into custody by police. Upon interrogation, he said he told the teacher ‘I don’t want to shoot you’ and proceeded to say the name of the student that he did want to shoot. The victim has not been officially named but his friends have been tweeting about his condition throughout the course of the day. Like many other schools across the country, Taft Union High School was rocked by the events of December 14, when a shooter killed 20 young children and six adults before killing himself at Sandy Hook Elementary School. In light of that, Taft officials went over the emergency response plan and evacuation routes just this morning hours before the shooting. Response: The sheriff said that two units responded to the scene within one minute of the first emergency calls and local, state and federal officials kept the scene on lock down throughout the afternoon . Comfort: A number of schools- including a middle school and a community college- are all located near the science building where the shooting took place and students from all of those schools were alerted . Waiting for word: Parents gather outside of Taft Union High School while they wait to collect their children from the scene of the latest school shooting . The shooter was meant to be in the science classroom where he opened fire but did not come to school on time. Instead he went into the building half-way through the class armed with a shotgun and began to fire. At that time, the school bell had just rung at a nearby school and the principal told students to get inside over the intercom. A number of students at the California . school called 911 and their parents on their cell phones from inside the . school once they heard the sound of the gunshot. One girl called 911 then called her . mother saying that she was in the classroom where the student had been . shot and that the victim was lying on the ground in a pool of blood. 'My . friend's been shot,  the teacher's been shot- I don't know what to do,' the girl reportedly said to her mother on her cell phone. A friend of the injured student tweeted that the victim had to go into surgery after being hit in the shoulder with a shotgun. The . victim, thought to be a male student in his junior year at the school, . sustained injuries to his liver, lung and diaphragm due to the direction . of the bullet. Lining up: Anxious parents get ready to pick up their students at Taft High School as well as a neighboring middle school . Waiting for answers: A crowd of either students or parents gathers with police inside a back gate of the school following the shooting earlier in the day . Securing the grounds: Police in bullet-proof vests are seen leaving the science building where the shooting took place . A local reporter said that he had spoken . with seven different parents who said that the shooter was suspended . last year for having a 'hit list' of students that he wanted to hurt or . kill, though officials have refused to comment as they do not yet know . all of the facts in the case. Buzzfeed reports that a student admitted to falsely warning of a school shooting at Taft Union High School in December. It . is unclear if that student had anything to do with today's shooting, . but when questioned by police in December he admitted that his threat . was false. The local ABC affiliate received two . separate calls from people who were hiding in closets during the . incident, and the shooter- who is believed to be a student at the . school- was taken into custody by police at around 9.20am. The . shooting took place in the physical sciences building on campus, and . the West Kern Water District building was put on lock-down as a . precaution because it is located right next to the school, according to Bakersfield Californian. Medical attention: The one seriously injured student was airlifted by helicopter to a local hospital . On the ground: Republican congressman Kevin McCarthy was at the school leading up to the press conference . As of 11am, officials from the Kern County Sheriff's Department were still checking each room in the school. During the afternoon press conference, Sheriff Youngblood said that the school regularly has an armed policeman on campus as a security precaution, but the police officer was running late to school today because he was snowed in. The . public school is located in the small town of Taft which is about an . hour's drive outside of Bakersfield in southern California. The nearby middle school- Lincoln Junior High School- was shut down as a warning when the shooting at Taft Union School was reported. Felicity Reich, 13, said that her teachers told all of the students that a shooting had taken place at the high school. 'They were all trying to keep each other happy and not flip out,' she said of students trying to keep one another calm. Latest incident: Taft Union High School was the scene of a school shooting on Thursday morning and initial reports said that two people were injured but only one needed medical attention . Shooting: Two people were reported as being shot at Taft Union High School outside of Bakersfield in California . Republican congressman Kevin McCarthy . was quick to release his condolences over Twitter, saying: 'I am deeply . saddened and troubled by news of the shooting. Judy and I offer our . prayers to the victims, their families and the entire Taft community.' He was present on the scene shortly after the shooting along with all relevant local officials. 'All the . resources one can possibly imagine to respond to a horrible tragedy are . here,' Taft City Councilman Dave Noerr told the Bakersfield Californian . after arriving at the scene. 'This is a small community. We're one big family. 'We're doing everything we can for each other.' The school was originally opened in 1912 and one of it's . biggest claims to fame was that it was featured in a 1986 film starring . Robin Williams and Kurt Russell called The Best of Times. The shooting comes just less than a month since the horrific shooting took place at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut that left 20 children dead along with six adult educators.

"By . Josh Howie . PUBLISHED: . 20:47 EST, 11 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:50 EST, 11 January 2013 . Chaotic childhood: Josh Howie, seen aged four with his mother Lynne Franks in 1980, describes the entrepreneuer as 'unique' What no one tells you when you become a parent is just how judgmental you will be towards fellow parents. That feeling of self-righteous smugness as you mentally admonish how others feed, discipline and entertain their offspring can be utterly overwhelming. And, sadly, the parents who bear the brunt of it tend to be our very own. How can you not compare and contrast the childhood your parents gave you with what you hope to provide for your children? Those with happy memories want to replicate their experiences, then there are others whose experiences serve as a warning, a map of exactly what not to do. Guess which camp I fall into? I had a unique mother. An army of nannies, chauffeurs, cleaners and cooks served in the front line of my and my sister’s young lives, presided over from far in the rear by Generalissimo Lynne Franks, aka Mummy. My mother was the inspiration for Absolutely Fabulous’s rather bonkers PR supremo, Edina Monsoon. If you’ve ever seen Ab Fab on TV, you’ll already have a pretty clear picture of the madness I faced daily while growing up. What wasn’t in the show was the fact I’d had more than 20 nannies by the time I was 16. Some were good, some much less so — and none could hack life in our house for long. Even though in numerous interviews my mum has gone into how she regrets not being around for much of our childhoods, she can be sensitive when I say something similar. If you've ever seen Ab Fab... you'll have a pretty clear picture of the madness I faced daily while growing up . I don’t want to upset her (I also have to think of the long game: I don’t want to be cut out of the will), but it’s fair to say her career came first when my sister and I were growing up. The legend goes that 20 minutes after I was born she was on the phone to work, and she didn’t get off again until I was in my late teens. During that time, she and my father Paul Howie, a designer, also managed to raise me as a Buddhist, shove macrobiotic food down my throat and live as a Native American. And those were the fun parts. I didn’t think so at the time. I grumbled and whined my way through it all, but without them, I wouldn’t be the interestingly troubled soul I am today. I wouldn’t change any of it (well, maybe the macrobiotic food). Inspiration: Workaholic PR guru Franks, left, inspired the character of chain-smoking, champagne-swilling Eddie Monsoon in Absolutely Fabulous, played by Jennifer Saunders . I had a life of privilege with . expensive schools, exotic luxury holidays and the best therapists to . complain to. I feel lucky to have had parents whose hard work led to so . many opportunities for us — but it’s not the kind of upbringing I’d . dream of inflicting on my own children. I . have two young sons and the vagaries of my childhood couldn’t be more . different to theirs.  They have two adoring parents who share the . childcare. It is the complete opposite of the parenting model I grew up . with. With a third . energy-sapper on the way to join our 11-month-old, Art, and . three-year-old, Mordechai, a chorus of inquiries is swelling as to . whether my wife and I will be getting a nanny. The answer is a . thundering: ‘Never!’ At most, a friend will look after the children if my wife and I need to be somewhere. For . us, having children is about getting our hands dirty. Not only with the . nappies, but by nourishing each offshoot of personality, each growth of . self. This is in stark contrast to my own childhood. Wildly eccentric: Looking back Josh Howie, seen with his mother in 1997, left, can identify with the character of long-suffering Saffy in Ab Fab, seen right with on-screen mother Eddie . I’ve . no memory of the earliest nannies, but someone must have kept us alive . during the endless days where my sister Jessica and I would be lucky to . catch a glimpse of either parent. Things . changed slightly when I was eight and my parents became Buddhists. From . then, what little time they did have before and after work was spent . chanting. An hour-and-a-half every single day. I was mesmerised by a friend's mum making a sandwich . When . it became apparent this was the only time I’d get to spend in their . company, I joined in. I also worked out that if I wanted anything — say a . new bike — I’d just have to say I’d been chanting for one and it would . magically appear. At the weekends, we were all together, after a fashion. Saturdays were spent being dragged to photo- shoots and fashion shows. It sounds exciting, but when you’re six, what this really entails is trying not to get up to too much trouble in the corner while throngs of adults run about you in a flustered panic. Flashing cameras? Supermodels? Boring! Meanwhile, Sundays were taken up with all-day lunches in expensive trendy restaurants. Crawling under tables among the legs of the important and talented can lose its shine after a few years. I hated the lack of consistency. One minder left after just four hours. Bonds repeatedly formed, then broken, created issues of abandonment for me that exist to this day. This is partly why I wanted three children — now my wife can never leave me. Workaholic parents are worse than alcoholics because meetings can’t cure them — so each nanny’s departure heralded a new chapter of my childhood. I clearly remember Jill, who was with me for three years until I was six, but she detested me and Jessica. As precocious as we were, this only really made sense when we found out years later that Jill and my dad had been having an affair. On-screen: Saffy, Edina's long-suffering and straight-laced daughter, was played by Julia Sawalha in the classic BBC comedy, which starred Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley . Sue followed Jill and a blissful year of unconditional love and happiness followed, until the poor woman abruptly left after having descended into schizophrenia. Dee came next — but she abandoned us for Julie Andrews’s children. Yes, Mary Poppins stole my nanny! ...It's not the kind of upbringing I'd dream of inflicting on my own children . Susanna, though, was our favourite. Fair, unbiased, friendly, strict. Two years of stability and boundaries followed her arrival, and she’s the only reason I’m half normal. If only she had finished the job instead of getting pregnant by our hairdresser. Then came 1985 — the year of nannies with no names. I’ve no idea why we got through so many then, but there was never enough time to learn who they were. Stability, of a sort, was found in the massive form of Kiwi rugby player Kim late that year. But she was fired after hitting me for breaking her Melissa Etheridge cassette. My dad sacked her on the spot with the simultaneously comforting and unsettling words: ‘The only person who gets to hit my children is me.’ I remember thinking how gallant he was to protect me, because she could so easily have taken him. So nannies came and nannies went and I don’t believe I was at all unhappy. This home life was my reality and I didn’t know any different. All this changed when I visited my friend Jimmy’s house one day after school in 1986 when I was ten. I was mesmerised by his mother standing in their kitchen, making us a sandwich. My little brain couldn’t compute what was happening. Why was his mother home in the afternoon? Why was she asking what we wanted? Why was she doing it herself? Had I gone to heaven? Eccentric: Lynne Franks now relishes the job of being a grandmother, her son says . These seemed to be the dominant archetypes of femininity I was exposed to during the Eighties: docile housewife or career woman. My mother, ever ahead of the curve, was the most extreme version of the latter. My parents worked hard. They played hard. But they didn’t parent hard. I don’t think it’s helpful to look at the past and apportion blame. My parents were from a different generation with different values, reacting against their own upbringings. But amid the desperate struggle to get on the housing ladder, modern-day parents are more inclined to want to enjoy time with their children. Young families like mine might form part of the first generation to achieve some kind of balance: to work hard and play hard — but with the playing done with our children. My wife and I share the role of primary carer to our children and we get to work passionately on our careers. Where I’m exceptionally blessed is having my wife to hold my hand. She’s the embodiment of nurturing and has enough love and attention for the children and to fill my own bottomless pit of neediness. She’s also a therapist (very useful for me) and the hours work well around the children. I’m at home all day when she’s working. Then, in the evening, once the children are in bed, I head off to work as a stand-up comic and spend the mornings before the children wake focusing on my writing. For the moment, our children still like us, and it’s only for a relatively small amount of time that we can maintain such a central roles in their lives. Soon enough, they’ll be in school and their peers will be the ones having that impact — but on foundations my wife and I have laid down during these precious first few years. The first person who’d agree with this new way of doing things is my mum. When she comes to visit us, she transforms from business supremo to building blocks supremo. She still works hard, but there’s now a job she relishes most of all. The job of being grandma.","Josh Howie describes his 'unique' mother Lynne Franks, who inspired bonkers PR supremo Edina Monsoon in TV's Absolutely Fabulous .

The garment is by Netherlands-based designer Anouk Wipprecht, a rising star in the field of wearable design, whose work explores the interaction between fashion and technology. Like a real spider, the unsettling dress responds to external stimuli by coyly dancing around the wearer's body. Creepy: The Spider Dress by Anouk Wipprecht and Daniel Schatzmayr responds to strangers who stray too close by protectively drawing its legs against the wearer's body . Unsettling: The dress has sensors which move its limbs in response to what is happening around it . Ms Wipprecht, whose techno-couture garments have been worn by Fergie of The Black Eyed Peas, told fashioningtech.com the dress deals with themes of 'personal space' and raises questions of control and privacy. Created in collaboration with with Viennese software engineer and hacker Daniel Schatzmayr, the garment's robotic component uses sensors to move its limbs in response to what is happening around it. The pair say the dress was created with the aim of giving more power and 'pyschological thrills' to the 'sugar-sweet character' of many fashion tech garments. It was presented during VIVE LE ROBOTS / Cafe Neue Romance in Prague during the EU Robotics week last November and prototyped during TEDX Vienna in collaboration with the 'Metalab' - Vienna's famous hackerspace. Moody: The dress deals with themes of 'personal space' and raises questions of control and privacy . 'Playful exploration': Ms Wipprecht's work studies the increasing interaction between humans and machines . In an interview with fashiontech.com, she said her work was a 'playful exploration' of the ever-more intimate relationship between humans and machines which is making electronics an extension of the self. 'Technology combined with fashion creates new ways of communication between people, a new relationship between interface and the body, and a new connection of the body with technology,' she said. 'For me it is a playful exploration, where the body is the platform of interaction and expression. The position that technology has in our society (i.e. to 'please' us) will get more and more intimate, and as technology crawls closer to the skin we will need to start to rethink and recreate the relation that we have towards technology. Risque: Ms Wipprecht's Intimacy dress, which is made from materials which turn from opaque to transparent in response to the wearer's level of arousal, as measured by her heart rate . 'In a way, communication-wise, techno enhanced fashion has the potential to mediate a human in more ways than a human can mediate itself. Therefore, amongst other reasons, I am interested in how emotional, social and psychological processes can be influenced using electronics as an extension of the self.' Ms Wipprecht's previous works include a dress which emits a 'smoke screen' of dry ice to camouflage its wearer when someone approaches, and another which turns see through based on its wearer's 'personal interactions'. That latter dress, dubbed Intimacy, is constructed from smart e-foils which change from opaque to transparent in response to the wearer's level of arousal, as measured by her heart rate.","Anouk Wipprecht's Spider Dress responds to external stimuli by coyly dancing around its wearer's body .

The mother of the young Indian woman who was fatally gang raped on a bus in New Delhi has called for the men who murdered her daughter to be hanged. Speaking of the gang who beat her 23-year-old daughter so badly she died almost two weeks later in hospital, she said: 'My soul will never know any rest if the men who tormented my daughter are not hanged.' The 46-year-old also spoke of how her daughter, a physiotherapy student, whispered to her on her death bed: 'Mama, I want them to be burnt alive.' The Ravidas camp, pictured, is the notoriously lawless slum where four of the six accused by police in the Delhi gang rape case, are said to be from. The victim's mother has said she wants the men who killed her daughter to be hanged . On December 16 last year the woman was attacked by a group of men using a tyre iron as a weapon as she travelled on a bus home with a male companion following a trip to the cinema. She suffered massive internal injuries, brain damage and a heart attack, dying in a hospital in Singapore 13 days after the attack. Her brutal murder has sparked furor throughout India, with mass demonstrations for women's rights and calls for tougher rape laws. The woman's mother, speaking to The Sunday Telegraph at her ancestral home in Medawara Kalan, in the northern state of Utter Pradesh, paid tribute to her daughter, saying: 'She was our life. 'I want only one thing. I want to see those animals hang.' The female victim and her male companion boarded what appeared to be an ordinary private mini-bus after watching the film Life of Pi together. Her male friend said a gang of six men aboard the bus - fitted with curtains and tinted windows - had planned to trap them. Accusations: A Delhi police van, believed to be carrying the accused in . the gang rape of a 23-year-old woman, enters a district court in New . Delhi . Claims: Policemen report for duty at the court. A lawyer for three of the men accused of the brutal rape and killing of a 23-year-old woman claims his clients have been tortured into admitting the crime . Once on the bus, he was attacked and the 23-year-old was gang-raped by a group of allegedly drunk men, including the driver, who also violated her with an iron bar causing immense internal damage that lead to her death, he said. The man, believed to be the only witness in the case, said he did his best to fight off the offenders. The attackers eventually discarded the two of them by a roadside. Ten days after the incident the woman was flown from a hospital in India to an intensive care ward in Singapore, where it was hoped specialists might be able to save her. By the time her parents were informed of the nature of the injuries and flown to be by her bedside in Singapore, she was barely able to speak, with much of her last communication being only in sign language. Her mother added: 'When one of few things she said to me was: ""Mama, I want them to be burnt alive"". The chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, Akhilesh Yadav, handed over a cheque to the woman's family for £26,000 as compensation for their daughter's death. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav interacts with the media at the village of the Delhi gangrape victim . He also announced plans to build a hospital in the village, currently some 120 miles away from proper medical facilities. But the woman's mother said she was not interested in compensation, only the death of the vile perpetrators. Last week five men appeared in court charged with kidnap, gang-rape and murder of the woman. A sixth defendant, believed to be 17, faces charges in a juvenile court. Several of the accused came from the same notorious district of Delhi, a so-called 'slum cluster' called Ravidas Camp, which has a lawless reputation. A lawyer for three of the accused has claimed his clients have been tortured and coerced into admitting the crime. Manohar Lal Sharma told the BBC that one of the men had been tortured for 10 days. Mr Sharma said he plans to represent bus driver Ram Singh and his brother Mukesh as well as a third man Akshay Thakur and they planned to plead not guilty. Today marks the end of the formal Hindu morning period for the student, after 13 days of various prayers and rituals designed to let the soul pass peacefully to the next level of existence.

It nearly didn’t make it on to our screens because TV bosses feared a drama about the grim realities of midwifery in the 1950s would be, well, too grim. So it’s all the more remarkable that BBC1’s Call The Midwife has not only enjoyed record-breaking viewing figures, but also inspired a new generation of midwives. Despite the show’s realistic birth scenes – made all the more gritty thanks to the advice of an on-set midwife – applications for midwifery courses have soared since the show first aired last year. Surge: The popularity of Call the Midwife, the show which has made actress Miranda Hart a household name, has seen applications for midwifery courses soar . Ucas, the official university and college applications body, said there was a 16.5 per cent rise in midwifery applications last year, with universities around the UK reporting a similar trend. Cardiff University saw a 24 per cent increase in applications for its courses for 2012/13, while Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridgeshire has seen an 11.6 per cent rise for students wishing to enrol in September 2013, compared with last year. Senior lecturer in midwifery at Anglia Ruskin, Frances Galloway, said the programme, which stars Miranda Hart and Jenny Agutter, was often mentioned on application forms for her course. She added: ‘Call the Midwife has helped to highlight the profession of midwifery and bring it to the fore in a way that it hadn’t been previously. ‘It has made people more open to considering it as a career in its own entity not just as a part of nursing. And it is its own career so that is very important.’ Gail Johnson, professional adviser for education at the Royal College of Midwives, said the programme gave people the chance to consider entering the career, adding: ‘The programme portrays the midwives working in the community, right at the heart of families.’ Gritty: The show follows the lives of midwives in 1950s East London and features realistic birth scenes . Writer of the series, Heidi Thomas also noticed the programme’s effect on the profession after she met the head of midwifery at  Glamorgan University. Miss Thomas said: ‘She came over and said: “I run a nursing hospital at a university in Wales and you have made my life extremely difficult”. 'Very proud': The show has helped to inspire a new generation of trainee midwives . ‘She said she used to struggle to fill her midwifery course which has 16 places each year and this year she had almost 1,000 applications for those places.’ She said she was ‘very proud’ to have ‘shone a light on midwifery’. The show, which returns for a second series this year, attracted an average of 8.7million viewers last year, making it the biggest new drama series on BBC1 since records began in 2001. It follows the day-to-day lives of young midwives in 1950s East London and deals with the hardships they faced. Now in its second series, Call the Midwife, which has turned comic actress Hart into a household name, is based on a trilogy of books by late author Jennifer Worth, and has been adapted to script by Heidi Thomas, who also worked on Cranford. Professional midwife Terri Coates is consulted on every scene and is on set to advise. Real babies are used throughout, the youngest just four days old, and the birth scenes are so realistic that producers feared a backlash from viewers. ‘Everybody said no one will watch this show. Everyone said men won’t watch it, women won’t watch it, pregnant women will be frightened by it, so it didn’t really leave a very big audience,’ Miss Thomas said. The show’s success saw the first series end on a high with 9.2million viewers tuning in to watch the final episode, resulting in a series average overnight of 8.7million which made it the biggest new drama series on the channel since records began (in 2001). And the link to midwifery applications has made the production team ‘very proud,’ Miss Thomas said. ‘We’ve shone a light on midwifery.’","Applications for midwifery courses have rocketed since Call the Midwife first aired on the BBC last year .

A new mother was scarred for life after an allergic reaction to her son while he was still in the womb. Dayle Byrom, 20, from Wakefield, developed a burning rash all over her body while pregnant with Jacob. Doctors believe she has a rare intolerance to testosterone, which was produced by her baby as the foetus grew. Greatest reward: Dayle Byrom at home with baby Jacob, now one, whose hormones caused her an unbearably painful allergic reaction when he was in the womb . The first-time mother noticed the rash when she was 20 weeks' pregnant and was soon crippled by searing pain and unbearable itching. She was in so much discomfort she even told boyfriend Tom Hayward, 21, that she thought having a termination might be the only solution. 'The pain got worse day by day,' she said. 'It started when I was 20 weeks’ pregnant and was at its worst at 30 weeks. 'My skin was on fire. If I touched . anything it was agony. I couldn’t sit down or keep still. All I could do . was itch and cry - it felt like someone was ripping my skin off. 'I tried wearing gloves, but nothing . stopped me digging at my skin. All I cared about was scratching, and . everyday tasks became impossible. 'I felt like my body was telling me I shouldn’t be a mother. Sheer agony: The 20-year-old said the severe rash made her feel as though someone was ripping her skin off . 'Even though I was too far . into my pregnancy, I still begged Tom for an abortion. I wasn’t thinking . straight. I regretted ever getting pregnant in the first place.' She pleaded with doctors to help but no-one could tell her the cause or suggest treatment. 'My GP told me it was the worst case . she’d ever come across. I saw ten different doctors, and no-one could . tell me what caused the rash. 'I was prescribed all sorts of . antihistamine creams but nothing made the slightest bit of difference.' Jacob was born on May 6 - and only then . was Ms Byrom referred to a dermatologist at Pontefract Hospital, who . suggested a rare allergy was to blame. She was diagnosed with Polymorphic . Eruption of Pregnancy (PEP), which usually affects only first-time . mothers and flares up in the later stages of pregnancy. Her legs are now pockmarked with sores caused by constant scratching. Stark reminder: Ms Byrom has been left with permanent scars on her legs after the 'nightmare' pregnancy . Ms Byrom, who works as a dog groomer and has no history of allergies, said: 'The dermatologist examined me for allergies and discounted the most common ones. 'He said he was certain the rash was caused by an allergic reaction to testosterone which was produced while Jacob was growing inside of me. 'He said it was very rare to have an outbreak as bad as mine, but in the handful of similar cases, the women have gone on to have boys. 'I was told if I didn’t stop scratching immediately, I would have to be bandaged up. 'I’ve ruined my skin. The scars are very deep and, unfortunately, they’re never going to heal properly. 'I’m absolutely gutted. I can’t wear dresses or skirts any more. When I wore shorts in summer, people stopped me in the street and asked me questions about the marks. 'Most women lose their confidence because of stretch marks, but mine’s been ruined by the damage to my legs. When on the rare occasion I go out, I have to cover up.' PEP, which affects around one in 300 pregnancies, is still not fully understood by medical experts and there is currently debate over whether the sex of the baby is a cause. Huge relief: Ms Byrom with her son Jacob and partner Tom Hayward after the birth . Dr Samantha Vaughan-Jones, consultant dermatologist and spokesperson for the British Association of Dermatologists, said: 'PEP is more common in the first pregnancy, and occurs more commonly with multiple pregnancy - twins or triplets. 'There is some debate over the role of foetal sex, and I did some research and wrote a paper where I showed that PEP was more prevalent in women carrying male foetuses than females. 'This was supported by another study but has not been confirmed in any subsequent studies, so the conclusions are not clear. However, no studies have looked at the role of testosterone.' Director of Clinical Services at charity Allergy UK Maureen Jenkins said: 'If there is an existing chronic condition, such as an allergy, pregnancy can have an effect. Some people experience really bad reactions, but sometimes the opposite is true and their symptoms improve. 'However, there are no studies or figure relating to allergies to testosterone.' Her symptoms are gradually easing but Ms Byrom still compulsively scratches and fears she will never be able to return to pet grooming, as shampoo and other cleaning agents now severely irritate her skin. She said: 'Whenever I get into the bath or use baby lotion the itching comes back. I’ve accepted that it’s something I will have to live with. 'I tried to find other women who have experienced the same situation, but I didn’t find much on the internet. Thankfully, the dermatologist has been brilliant. 'I wanted a girl but, despite everything, I’m so glad I’ve had Jacob. It’s been a nightmare, but I wouldn’t change a thing. 'After the birth I swore I would never have any more children, but I’m starting to feel a bit more confident, and we’re already considering having a second child. 'I’m scared my symptoms will return when I have more kids, but I won’t let it put me off. Despite my bizarre allergy, having Jacob is still the best thing I’ve ever done.'","Painful and itchy rash began covering Dayle Byrom's body at 20 weeks .

Raymond Dupree allegedly stabbed great-nephew Ryan King, pictured, who died at his mother's birthday party . A former boxer who killed his great-nephew by stabbing him in the neck with a wine glass told police it was ‘just a family fall-out’, a court has heard. Raymond Dupree slashed Ryan King’s throat, severing his jugular vein, after a row broke out during a family birthday party at a country mansion. The 68-year-old only realised what he had done when he heard Mr King’s mother screaming, ‘No, no, not my baby’ in hospital, the court was told. He then turned to the policeman guarding him and said: ‘Oh for ****’s sake, I haven’t killed the b***er have I? I did not mean to do that. 'I did not mean to hurt him.’ The jury at Exeter Crown Court heard how Dupree and Mr King, 20, were guests at the Snurridge Manor House, near South Molton in north Devon, in August last year. The house, which is owned by Bernadette Soton, Dupree’s sister and Mr King’s grandmother, is  normally rented out for exclusive country house parties. However, that night it was being used to celebrate the 40th birthday of Mrs Soton’s daughter Lisa  Wilson, Mr King’s mother. She was pregnant at the time. The court heard how a row broke out at around 3am after Dupree began yelling at a group of teenagers who were still up and playing music. After being confronted by Mr King, Dupree is alleged to have picked up a wine glass from the kitchen table before smashing it into the younger man’s neck. Slashed his throat: Dupree, a former boxer (pictured) only realised what he had done when he heard Mr King's mother screaming 'No, no, not my baby' at the hospital . Mr King was taken to the North Devon District Hospital in Barnstaple, where Dupree was also treated for a cut to his hand caused by the breaking glass. Mr King’s family sobbed in the public gallery yesterday as they heard about the moment when his mother was told he had died. PC Graham Janes said that he found Dupree in a country lane next to Snurridge House after officers were called. Row broke out: Dupree yelled at a group of teenagers, and confronted by Mr King (right), he is alleged to have smashed a wine glass into the young man's neck at the Snurridge Manor House (left) He . said: ‘I noticed a man walking towards me with blood splats on his . clothing and blood dripping from his hand. When I shone a torch at him . he swore at me. He said “What are you being like that for? It was just a . family fall-out”.’ After . being arrested and cautioned on suspicion of causing grievous bodily . harm, it is claimed Dupree then told PC Janes: ‘I  ain’t denying it . anyway. I hit him. I hit the boy. I think I’ve got more  of a cut than . he has.’ PC Janes told the court: ‘I asked if he . had consumed alcohol and he said he’d had a bottle of rosé. I did not . think he was drunk. He could stand without assistance and was not . slurring his speech. While we were at hospital we heard screaming coming . from an adjacent room. A woman was screaming “No, no, not my baby. It’s . not happening, it’s not happening”.

My nephew, my niece, oh ****ing hell.”’ ‘Later he was told he was being arrested for murder and replied “I’m so sorry. This will be the end of me. How can I ever speak to my family again?” He had his head in his hands.’ Dupree, of Bishop’s Nympton, near South Molton, denies murder, claiming it was an accident. The trial continues.

Tragedy: Detectives are treating the death of pharmacist Joanna Smith, 32, as manslaughter after her tryes were found to have been deliberately punctured . A crash which claimed the life of a 32-year-old woman was caused by vandalism to one of the tyres on her car, police have said. Detectives are now treating the death of pharmacist Joanna Smith as manslaughter after forensic tests showed a tyre on her Honda Jazz had been punctured deliberately. It is the first time in the UK a fatal car crash has been blamed on vandals. Mrs Smith, from Northampton, who had . been married to husband John Smith for under a year, is thought to have . been unaware of the vandalism when she set off for work in Irchester on . the morning of April 10. The victim, originally from Poznan in . Poland, was pronounced dead on the eastbound A45 near Earls Barton after . the damaged tyre caused her to crash while travelling at between 60mph . and 70mph. Detective Chief Inspector Martin . Kinchin, from the East Midlands special operations unit major crime . team, said: 'While investigating the incident that led to Joanna’s . death, our collision investigation team established that it was likely . that tyre failure caused a loss of control of the car. 'The tyres from Joanna’s car were . then sent to scientists who are specialists in the examination of tyres, . who concluded that one of them had been deliberately punctured.' Following the collision, officers were informed by members of the public that a further three vehicles parked in close proximity to the Honda had also sustained tyre damage at the same time. The victim’s vehicle was parked in a communal car park near her home in Grange Park when the tyre - which only partially deflated - was punctured.

Wreckage: Mrs Smith was pronounced dead on the eastbound A45 near Earls Barton after she crashed while travelling at between 60mph and 70mph . Mr Kinchin added: 'After being informed by the scientists that Joanna’s tyre had been deliberately damaged, coupled with the other three incidents in the area where Joanna lived, we contacted the Crown Prosecution Service for advice about how the case should proceed. Plea: The police are appealing for information into Joanna's death . 'Following their feedback we are now investigating the collision as manslaughter. 'We believe that someone deliberately damaged the tyre on Joanna’s car which ultimately resulted in her death. 'We do not believe Joanna was specifically targeted but was the tragic victim of senseless vandalism.' Mr Kinchin continued: 'Although we do not believe the person who damaged Joanna’s car set out to cause her death, their actions had a very serious outcome. 'Anyone committing this kind of crime needs to stop and think about the potential consequences of their actions.

A nurse sacked for having sex with a patient killed herself just four days into a misconduct hearing, an inquest has heard. Elizabeth Watts, 38, was found hanged after lurid details about her sexual encounters with a male patient in his 40s were made public. She was fired from her job after the patient informed hospital officials about their affair, which started after he was admitted to A&E. Tragic: Nurse Elizabeth Watts was found hanged just hours after being admitted to a specialist psychiatric unit . Scene: North Devon District Hospital where Elizabeth Watts worked as a nurse and was alleged to have started a sexual relationship with a patient . Miss Watts was fired following an internal investigation and both were then called to appear at a Nursing and Midwifery Council tribunal. During that hearing the patient said that Miss Watts had taken him back to her house for 'rough sex' after he was discharged. He also claimed she committed a sex act while he was on a hospital trolley - which she denied. Miss Watts admitted having sex with him but said nothing had happened until after he had been discharged from hospital. The misconduct hearing was then . adjourned so Miss Watts could appear and give her evidence - but four . days later she was found dead. The inquest in Plymouth heard yesterday how Miss Watts, of Appledore, Devon, took an overdose two days . after the hearing but was saved by a friend. An ambulance was called and she was sectioned under the Mental Health Act and sent to a psychiatric unit. But she was found hanged in her room at 4am on Friday, January 28 - despite being observed by staff every 15 minutes . Hearing: Miss Watts admitted having sex with the man and swapping e-mails but said nothing untoward took place until after he was discharged. The inquest heard she had become depressed about the case. A statement by her friend Michael Harries said: 'At the end of February 2009, she told my wife and I that she had been suspended from her job. 'She had no intention of telling anybody what it was about. She didn't tell me any of the details but she did say it was serious. 'She was no more graphic than that. In the two years after the complaint she became more and more depressed. 'She loved nursing and if that was taken away from her she wouldn't know what to do. 'Lizzie had made her mind up that she wanted to take her own life. It was inevitable at some stage she would get her wish.' Overdose: The inquest heard Miss Watts died two days after being transferred to a psychiatric facility following a suspected overdose . Miss Watts lost her job after the patient came forward and said they'd had sex after he was admitted to the A&E department of the North Devon District Hospital in Barnstaple in February, 2009. She was later suspended and sacked from the hospital where she had worked since 1998, after qualifying as a nurse in 1995. On January 24, 2011, the NMC hearing - established to decide if she should be struck off - heard the patient had been rushed to the hospital. He told the conduct hearing that Miss Watts had 'taken advantage' of him while he was still in hospital. He said Miss Watts - known as Lizzie to her friends -  had stroked him in a 'personal area' on a trolley in the middle of the night. He then said she offered him a lift to his home when he was released but then took him to her house in Appledore. He told the misconduct hearing she joined him in the shower before taking him to her bedroom. He said: 'I can't say that she forced me because I could have walked away. 'She wanted everything to be rough.' The panel heard they continued meeting over the following two days, exchanged a series of explicit e-mails and text messages. Service: Miss Watts had worked at the hospital for several years before the allegations were made public . But when their correspondence fizzled out on February 27 he reported the nurse to the North Devon Healthcare NHS Trust. Miss Watts admitted having sex with him but denied anything happened at the hospital and said their sexual relationship had begun the next evening. The hearing was adjourned until May 16, 2011, so she could attend in person to take to the witness stand in her defence. But four days after the patient's evidence was heard on January 28, 2011, police were called to an address in Appledore after receiving reports of someone with a suspected overdose. Miss Watts was taken to North Devon District Hospital - where she had worked for several years. She was sectioned under the Mental Health Act and transferred to NHS Plymouth's Glenbourne Unit, a psychiatric facility. She died two days later. The inquest heard psychiatric unit staff slept on duty and failed to check properly on Elizabeth Watts the night she died. Sergeant Steve Foale, of Devon & Cornwall Police, told the inquest that staff at the psychiatric unit had not followed procedures correctly. This included staff sleeping on their breaks, not updating records after a computer malfunction, and not placing Miss Watts in an observational room. The four-day inquest continues.","Nurse Elizabeth Watts killed herself days after a misconduct hearing, inquest hears .

A sperm donor has passed a rare genetic disorder to at least five of the 43 babies he is thought to have fathered, after screening measures at a fertility clinic failed to detect the mutation. The man transmitted the nerve disorder Neurofibromatosis  type I (NF1), known as Von Recklinghausen’s disease. The disease, which affects 4,000 babies a year in Britain, can cause high blood pressure, bone deformity, scoliosis, learning difficulties and eye problems, including tumours on the optic nerve. Insemination: Five children conceived using sperm from the donor have been diagnosed with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 . Nordisk Cryobank, the Copenhagen clinic where the Danish man donated his sperm, refused to say whether any British babies have been affected. However, a spokesman said the donor had fathered 43 children in ten different countries, including 18 in Sweden and Denmark. Regulations governing sperm donation vary from country to country, but prospective donors are generally required to: . Donor screening carried out at Nordisk Cryobank tests for conditions including: . Cystic Fibrosis . Thalassemia . Sickle Cell disease . Peter Bower, the clinic’s director . general, added: ‘In the case of these five, we know the disorder came . from the donor even though the disorder is not always transmitted by a . person’s parents.’ He added that the clinic could not release details about where and when the babies were born because of confidentiality rules. Its website states that all sperm is . tested for illnesses including HIV and cystic fibrosis. It does not say . whether it is screened for Von Recklinghausen’s disease. Denmark is introducing new rules around sperm donation as a result of the case. From October sperm from a single donor will only be used in a maximum of 12 inseminations. NF1 is caused by a genetic mutation. In half of all cases it is passed on from parent to child, and in the other half the mutation appears to develop on its own. A type of cancer known as malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours affects around 10 per cent of people with NF1.","Sperm bank in Copenhagen said five children conceived using the donor's sperm have NF1 nerve disorder .

A Greek restaurant faces losing its licence after locals reported being woken up to the sound of loud bouzouki music and smashing plates. Bosses of the Mythopolis restaurant have been ordered to attend a licensing hearing at Islington Council today after repeated complaints about noise. The eatery, in Islington, north London, had been granted a late licence to serve alcohol and play live music until 3.30am, but a stream of complaints led to council chiefs confiscating music equipment last week. Complaints: Greek restaurant Mythopolis in Islington could lose its licence after locals reported being woken up to the sound of loud bouzouki music and smashing plates (stock picture) Officers seized thousands of pounds worth of music gear, which has been impounded before the hearing when licensing chiefs decide on whether to withdraw the restaurant’s licence. Neighbours reported hearing ‘very loud’ traditional Greek music - played on a bouzouki - blaring until 3.30am and complained it was stopping them sleeping. Locals living near the restaurant also said that other noise included loud singing, smashing plates - a traditional Greek folk custom during celebrations such as weddings, birthdays and parties - and shouting. The restaurant is hailed as one of London’s only ‘Greek pop music’ venues and regularly hosts sessions played by performers from Cyprus and Greece. One local who complained to the council by letter but was not named said: 'The noise is an issue during the week where live music is played at an unacceptable noise level at unacceptable times. 'I must wake up early in the morning to go to work and find it hard to function due to lack of sleep.' Blaring music: Locals have complained that 'very loud' Greek music is being played until 3.30am leading to council chiefs confiscating music equipment . Another local, who asked not to be named, said: 'The music is the main issue, but there is also a problem with people standing around smoking and singing and shouting outside the restaurant. 'People have also heard plates being smashed, but I suppose that could just be kitchen staff dropping them by accident.' Owner Stephanos Makis said recently that he did not want ‘problems with the neighbours’, adding: 'We don’t have any fights, we don’t have any drugs. 'We do make mistakes but I think it’s the only Greek place in the Islington area.' Bosses at the restaurant have previously pledged to soundproof the restaurant but it will be up to councillors today as to whether to restrict the opening times of the venue or close it down completely.","Mythopolis bosses has been ordered to attend a licensing hearing at Islington Council .

But for Sam the black Labrador, just the mere mention of walkies is enough to make him hide behind the sofa. The one-year-old puppy suffers from agoraphobia after he was electrocuted and is now terrified of going outside. Scaredy dog: Terrified Sam has to be dragged through the streets of Stonehaven, Aberdeenshire, by his owner because he is too scared to leave the house . The once curious dog had been investigating smells in Stonehaven, Aberdeenshire, when he touched a metal drain which had an electric current flowing through it due to a fault in the power supply of a nearby street light. Despite taking strong medication since the incident, the terrified pup now has to be dragged around the streets of Stonehaven because he is scared stiff to leave the house. Owner, Donna Simpson, 36, said: 'I was just taking him for his usual walk when he suddenly jumped off the pavement onto the road and just went mental . 'Since then, when you head out of the door to take him for a walk, he's just not having it. 'If you try to cross the road or go anywhere else then that's it, he digs his heels in and he won't go - you've got to drag him.' No go area: A worried Sam peers out of the doorway of his home in Stonehaven too scared to go outside with his owner Donna Simpson . Miss Simpson's children, Jamie, two, and Ryan, 13, are desperate for their pet to recover to his usual playful self. She said: 'The boys are both really upset at what has happened to Sam. 'Jamie would always play with him, climb on him and pull at him and Sam wouldn't bat an eyelid, but not now. 'The vet gave me a special powder to through Sam's food for 20 days and it calmed him down a bit, but now he's finished his course, he's worse than ever. 'When he had that electric shock I'd never seen him react like that before. He's a black Labrador, which is the most docile dog you can get.' Walkies: Donna's son Jamie Walker with her black Labrador Sam (left) and Donna with Sam (right) Forlorn: Poor Sam is too terrified to leave his owner's home after he was electrocuted in Stonehaven . The faulty street light behind Sam's woes is operated by Aberdeenshire Council. Miss Simpson, a director of a cleaning and maintenance company, said: 'We weren't the only ones to be affected by this, there were other people I've spoken to who had the same problem with their dogs before Sam got an electric shock. 'The dog warden and a health and safety officer checked out the pavement on December 28 and they decided that there was nothing wrong. 'The council only cordoned off the area on the 29th and as far as I'm concerned if there had been complaints before then, there should have been more investigation into what was causing it.' Scene: Barclay Street in Stonehaven where Sam the Labrador suffered an electric shock . But a spokesman for Aberdeenshire Council insisted it was not aware of the hazard before Sam was shocked. 'The hydro board called us out about it on November 29, which was after the complainant's dog suffered an electric shock. 'The place was then cordoned off at nine o'clock that night. 'In conjunction with Scottish Hydro, the fault was identified and rectified as a matter of urgency.' Scottish Hydro Electric discovered the drain had become electrified because of a fault in the power supply to the street lights. The fault had caused the power to short circuit down a drain pipe which leads to the metal drainage channel that runs across the pavement. A spokeswoman from Scottish Hydro Electric added: 'The issue was resolved on the evening of December 3. 'It wasn't an electrocution, but the dog would have suffered an electric shock which obviously is very unfortunate, but I can confirm that the area is safe now.' Sam still suffers from agoraphobia despite taking drugs for the condition . Dogs can experience a variety of emotional and psychological disorders which can occur or are caused by either negative experiences, medical problems or by how the dog has spent the first weeks of its life. Agoraphobia is however, rare in dogs, especially when you consider how much they like to go for walks. But some canines are sensitive souls and can have fears and phobias, including fear of new places or situations, fear of unfamiliar people and or other dogs. The most common fear related problems are noise phobias, involving thunder, gunshots and fireworks. There are drugs which can be prescribed to combat these kind of behaviours including agoraphobia, anxiety, aggression and for mood stabilisation. The phobias or fears in agoraphobia for humans involve activities such as leaving home, entering public places or travelling alone. In these situations the person feels especially vulnerable and exposed, with nowhere to escape to or hide if things go wrong. An unusual but not uncommon feature of agoraphobia is a fear of crossing bridges, known as gephyrophobia. This is related to a feeling that, once on the bridge, there is no immediately available exit. The degree of fear and avoidance behaviour varies. Although many sufferers do manage to get out to work, some become completely housebound. Agoraphobia typically affects women and begins in early adulthood. They may have other psychological problems too, especially anxiety, depression, depersonalisation, panic attacks and obsessive behaviour.","Sam the Labrador was investigating smells in Stonehaven, Aberdeenshire, when he suffered an electric shock .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 12:05 EST, 3 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:17 EST, 3 January 2013 . A satirical magazine in France once firebombed for its portrayal of the Prophet Mohammed has published a 65-page cartoon biography of the Islamic holy figure. Charlie Hebdo put together a 65-page comic book which went on sale yesterday. The magazine's website claims the publication is 'halal' insisting that Muslim scholars and historians researched and edited the cartoon book. Controversial: The magazine which was firebombed in November 2011 for its portrayal of the Prophet Mohammed has again featured the Islamic holy figure . But it is likely to cause offence to . some Muslims, and picture include Mohammed naked as a baby as well as violent . images and other explicit scenes. 'It is a biography authorised by Islam since it was edited by Muslims,' the publisher, Stephane Charbonnier told AFP last week. 'I don't think higher Muslims could find anything inappropriate.' The Financial Times reported that In a note on the back page, Charlie Hebdo editor Stéphane Charbonnier . writes: 'We have put into pictures the life of Mohammed as it is . recounted by Muslim chroniclers. Without added humour. If the form seems . to some blasphemous, the foundation is perfectly halal. Up to you to . decide.' Charbonnier reportedly lives under police protection and has received numerous death threats. In September the offices were protected by riot police after the French government backed the publication of cartoons depicting a wheelchair-bound Prophet Muhammad being pushed by a rabbi. Courting controversy: The small-circulation weekly often draws attention for ridiculing sensitivity around the Prophet Muhammad . The publication comes after a controversial few months concerning the depiction of the Prophet Mohammed. In September an anti-Islam film made in California provoked some violent protests in several Muslim countries, and attacks on Western embassies. But the magazine is frequently in the firing line when it comes to controversial publications. Molotov cocktails were used to burn down the Charlie Hebdo offices in November 2011. Yet despite the firebomb attack, the magazine went on to print the image of Mohammed in a special four-page supplement. Bloody protests: Violent demonstrations broke out in Libya and across the Middle East on September 11 following the release of a U.S.-made film mocking the Prophet Mohammed . The weekly, known for its irreverent treatment of the political establishment and religious figures, bore the headline ‘Charia Hebdo’, in a reference to Muslim sharia law, and said that the issue had been guest-edited by Mohammed. The incident pits Europe’s tradition of free speech and secularism against Islam’s injunction barring any depictions seen as mocking the Prophet. The publication of cartoons of Mohammed in a Danish newspaper in 2005 sparked unrest in the Muslim world in which at least 50 people were killed. While French Muslim groups criticised Charlie Hebdo’s work, they also condemned the firebomb attack. The head of the Paris Mosque, Dalil Boubakeur, said at the time: ‘I am extremely attached to freedom of the press, even if the press is not always tender with Muslims, Islam or the Paris Mosque. French Muslims have nothing to do with political Islam.’","Satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo put together a 65-page book which went on sale yesterday .

David Hayes, 29, of Columbus won nearly $36,000 playing blackjack at an Ohio casino in October - but awoke hours later in his bed at home to a trio of armed robbers who apparently had followed him to his residence. 'I look at it as I lost $1,000, which is what I played with,' Hayes told The Columbus Dispatch. “I kept my life, and I got a manila envelope (as a souvenir).' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Robbed: David Hayes won nearly $36,000 in October - but then lost the money after three men apparently followed him home from the casino . Souvenir: Hayes accepted the money in a manila envelope (pictured) which the bandits left after absconding with the cash . Hayes brought the winnings home in the envelope - and the robbers left it behind when they absconded with the cash. Now, police are saying that they have busted a second suspect in connection with the brazen theft. Ronald Jones, 26, also of Columbus, has been reportedly charged with aggravated robbery after his Tuesday arrest. Also reportedly in custody and similarly charged is Ryan Bundy, 20, who lives at the same addresses as Jones and was picked up in October. He is also charged with related offences. Meanwhile, police told The Dispatch they are still searching for a third accomplice: Wendell Watkins Sr., 30, who is also charged with aggravated robbery. The casino: Hayes won the money at the Hollywood Casino Columbus in Columbus, Ohio. He said he wasn't aware he could accept a check, rather than the big, 'brick' of cash he did take . Magical run: Hayes hit the proverbial jackpot during a five-hour stint at the casino's blackjack tables that extended into the early morning . Cops apparently connected the dots after one of the men was overheard bragging about the theft, according to 10TV.com in Columbus. The affair begins with a magical, five-hour hot streak at a Hollywood Casino Columbus blackjack table that extended into the early morning hours of Oct. 21, in which Hayes won $35,800. Hayes told The Dispatch that he mistakenly accepted his winnings in cash - a big bundle of 358 $100 bills that the casino cashier placed in a manila envelope for him to conveniently carry home. The self-employed jewelry maker said he wasn't aware that he could instead choose to have the house cut him a check. 'It was a year’s salary, all in one night,' he reportedly said. 'It was the answer to everyone’s debt around me. I was so excited, I couldn’t sleep, thinking of things I was going to be able to do with the money.' Casino personnel reportedly escorted Hayes to not only the cashier, but also to his car when he left the establishment. In the wind: Police are still searching for Wendell Watkins, Sr., 30, in connection with the brazen robbery of Hayes' money . In custody: Ronald Jones, 26, and Ryan Bundy, 20, have already been charged with the robbery. Jones was arrested Tuesday . 'I stood out like a sore thumb from the moment I was playing to the moment I cashed out all the way to the car,' Hayes told 10TV.com in Columbus. 'I didn’t know what to do with it, because it was basically the size of a brick. They gave me a folder that this would be good enough, so I walked out with a football-sized envelope full of cash.' Then and after driving home, Hayes placed his luck-gotten gains on his nightstand, and went to sleep with the intention of depositing the winnings in the bank the first thing in the morning, The Dispatch reports. But hours later at about 7 a.m., he was rudely awakened by three armed men, one of whom placed a gun to his head. 'Clearly, that is a lot of cash, and we . think it’s more convenient and better for patrons to take a check rather . than take that amount of cash.' Hayes, for his part, reportedly thinks someone who standing in line at the cashier at the time he received his winnings saw his address written down by casino officials. Detective Thomas Clark of the Columbus police robbery squad told the Dispatch that’s likely what happened. 'Clearly, that is a lot of cash, and we think it’s more convenient and better for patrons to take a check rather than take that amount of cash,' Bob Tenenbaum, a casino spokesman, told The Dispatch. Lady Luck still continues to smile on Hayes, who has won back the amount he lost in the robbery during about a dozen return trips to the same casino. As for the manila envelope that once held his now-lost winnings, Hayes has another plan in mind: He's going to frame it.

A South Florida woman was fatally crushed during a boating accident this weekend in which her vessel got caught in the current near one of the bridges connecting Miami to Miami Beach. Authorities say that Janette Africano, 35, of Hialeah was pronounced dead at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami after a valiant effort to revive her that included the administration of nearly 45 minutes of CPR. Africano was motoring south on Saturday  around 5 p.m. with a male companion in an 18-foot red-and-white boat through the Intra-coastal Waterway that separates Miami, proper, from the South Beach area of Miami Beach, according to various media outlets. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Motoring: Janette Africano and a male companion identified as her husband were headed south through the body of water separating Miami from Miami Beach . Reversing course: The couple turned back north in their 18-foot vessel after they encountered a cruise ship making a turn ahead of them in the waterway . PortMiami: The couple reportedly came upon the cruise ship after approaching PortMiami, one of the busiest cruise ship ports in the U.S. Africano and the man - who is as-yet unnamed - encountered a cruise ship as they approached the General Douglas MacArthur Causeway, according to The Miami Herald. At that point, the couple reversed course and headed back north, or until they were apparently caught in the waterway's currents and maneuvered dangerously close to the causeway's pilings. 'We don’t know why the boat stopped underneath the MacArthur Causeway,'   Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission spokesman Jorge Pino told CBS Miami. A long span: The MacArthur Causeway is a lengthy bridge that runs over the Biscayne Bay, connecting Miami with Miami Beach . Caught in the current: The couple's boat was apparently forced toward one of the causeway's pilings by the bay's rough waters . 'But we do have some info the female that was on board the vessel was trying to push off from the bridge and at some point she became stuck between the bridge and the vessel.' 'We're looking into whether carelessness played a role, recklessness played a role, alcohol played a role,' Pino said. The official reportedly added that somehow Africano, 'ended up being crushed by the vessel and the bridge.' Meanwhile, a family friend told CBS Miami that Africano had been boating with her husband, although The Miami Herald identified the man as her boyfriend. Official account: Jorge Pino of the FWCC says Africano somehow got stuck between her boat and the piling as she tried to shove the vessel off, into the bay . 'He did everything he could but unfortunately it just didn’t work out,' Pino told the TV station. The Coast Guard escorted the boat to Watson Island where paramedics tried to revive Africano. But despite the ministrations, Africano, 'never moved,” reportedly said Jean Cadet who saw the rescue efforts. 'I’ve seen many accidents here in my career with the FWC, but this is certainly something unusual,' Pino told CBS Miami, adding, 'We want to get to the bottom of it and find out and learn from this accident maybe this will never have to happen again.'

Judge Charles Byers, right, described the killing as 'planned to the minute' 'You had previously made her life a misery, subjecting her to extreme physical and verbal abuse. 'You sent her evil text messages, you threatened her and others in . telephone calls, you tried to strangle her on one occasion and you had . previously threatened her with a knife . 'And yet she never offered you any malice of any sort.' He added: 'She decided after considerable thought and with every . justification that she had to leave you. You are a controlling man and . the only way you could continue to control her life was to take it from . her. 'Having threatened to do so the previous day you purchased a knife and . walked calmly through the streets of Ashford. You were determined quite . plainly from your body language on that CCTV in your quest and you had . only one thing on your mind and that was her murder. 'And you had no other intention that day I’m quite satisfied with that other than to kill her. This was a calculated, pre-meditated killing planned to the minute. 'Having established she was there by looking through the window at the back of the shop, you entered. 'The shop was open to the public and it was a place where she was . entitled to feel safe. You stabbed her repeatedly with frenzied blows . and with such force that one of those blows penetrated her shoulder . blade and you did that in front of a 17-year-old girl who was her friend . and colleague. 'You then walked calmly back to your car drove home and waited for arrest. You offered no help, You have showed no remorse. Even when interviewed . that day, you displayed a degree of arrogance. But no sorrow and no . appropriate emotion.' In mitigation, defence counsel Oliver Saxby said of Esack: 'He has unquestionably a lack of empathy and that surely must have played a part, if not in the killing itself, but in the way it was carried out and his conduct thereafter.' Bloodied: This image shows the knife used by Ivan Esack to attack his wife. The 8-inch blade bent and the tip broke off under the ferocity of the attack . Weapon: The packaging and receipt for the knife which Esack bought from Sainsbury's . After Esack’s conviction on Friday, questions were raised about whether police had missed opportunities to protect Mrs Esack. It emerged that she had spoken to police four times about the abusive former policeman, from 2009 to just a month before she was murdered. According to police, Mrs Esack was unwilling to support a prosecution, and failed to return phone calls and attend meetings because she did not want to harm his prospects. No referral was made to the police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Commission, about the previous contact between the force and Mrs Esack and no disciplinary issues were found. The case is now the subject of an independently chaired, multi-agency review which will report next month. Defending the police’s response, Detective Chief Inspector Paul Fotheringham, of the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate, said on Friday: 'I’m not sure they were missed opportunities. 'Even though we don’t necessarily need the victim of domestic abuse, we can look for other evidence and we do on a daily basis. Natalie consciously didn’t want to harm Ivan’s future.' Outside court on Friday, Mrs Esack’s father, Jim Wilkinson, told reporters: 'What can I say? Justice has been done. We are very happy with the result.' In a statement, Miss Ford called Mrs Esack 'my closest best friend'. She added: 'The world has lost a woman who wasn’t just beautiful on the outside but a special, caring person who’d help anyone she could.'","Ivan Esack, 38, stabbed his wife Natalie 11 times at salon in Ashford, Kent .

A model has spoken of how she rebuilt her life after she was stabbed and raped in her Majorca flat. Cheryl Maddison, 25, was knifed repeatedly in the neck, throat and back after being attacked as she returned home from work in a bar in Magaluf. Moroccan waiter Mohamed Fadel el Anssari, 31, is alleged to have carried out the brutal sex attack with a seven-inch kitchen knife before leaving her for dead in May 2008. Miss Maddison had only been on the Spanish holiday island for six days when the horrific attack occurred, leaving her to battle physical and mental scars. The ordeal left her too scared to go to bed or even be in the bath on her own. 'I couldn’t get the image of his hands out of my head. I used to think about his hands coming towards me and around my neck. It was horrible,' she told The Sun. 'I even took all the door handles off in my house so nobody else could open the doors. Eventually I told myself, ""I can’t carry on like this"".' She decided to face her fear and spent two summers  working in Zante, Greece as a Club 18-30 rep in 2011. She explained: 'I was determined not to let the attack stop me enjoying my life and travelling.

In his closing arguments following Fadel's three-day trial for rape and attempted murder, Mr Guasp said police believed Fadel was responsible for a number of violent sex attacks. He said: 'The majority of foreigners who come here are hard-working, decent people. But there are some who come here who are bad people. This was a terrible, wicked act. 'Spain gave Fadel the chance to work and reside here and this is how he pays Spain back. We are dealing with an evil person, a serial rapist.' Calling for Fadel to be jailed for 23 . years - 12 for attempted murder and 11 for rape - Mr Guasp added: 'If . we want to stop this sort of crime we need severe, harsh sentences. 'He . should spend all of those years in prison and should then be sent back . to Morocco, and he should never be allowed back here.'

Fadel was arrested in July 2011 following a lengthy undercover police investigation. Detectives recovered a cigarette he discarded in the street and found his DNA matched that found at the scene of the crime. The court heard he has twice confessed to raping and stabbing Miss Maddison and to a second rape on a British tourist in Magaluf in 2010. He was once arrested for a sexual assault on a minor and regularly beat his wife, the court heard. In 2011 Fadel told police and an investigating magistrate he had attacked Miss Maddison because she refused to have sex with him when he approached her in the stairwell of her apartment block, the court heard. Injuries: Cheryl Maddison, 25, was left for dead by her attacker in Magaluf. Neighbour Laura Pamela said she heard the cries but assumed they were from an arguing couple . Bandaged wound: Cheryl Maddison, pictured aged 21 in 2008, said she only realised he had stabbed her in the chest when she came round and stood up to find she had been lying in a large pool of blood .

Portalo also said police had failed to follow procedure by carrying out . the DNA tests without the prior authorisation of a judge. The . prosecutor dismissed those arguments as 'totally absurd'. The panel of . three judges will give their verdict in a written ruling. Holiday isle: Magaluf is the number one destination for British package tour holidaymakers .

"By . James Nye . PUBLISHED: . 10:30 EST, 14 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:30 EST, 14 January 2013 . The complex trial of a married man who is accused of strangling his mistress and the 15-month-old child they had together is due to begin this week. Authorities in St. Petersburg, Florida allege that former Air Force Sergeant Ralph 'Ron' Wright Jr. killed Paula O'Conner and son Alijah in July 2007 after she tried to sue him for their child's medical bills that would expose his infidelity. Expected to last three weeks and take in more 70 witnesses, the trial hinges on DNA evidence disputed by the defense and centered around a glove found at the scene of the murders that the prosecution say proves Wright, 44, is the culprit. Former Air Force Sgt. Ralph 'Ron' Wright Jr. strangled his ex-lover and suffocated their 15-month-old child according to St. Petersburg police . Police believe that Wright was wearing a pair of gloves to avoid leaving fingerprints at the scene of the crime. They claim that one of the black gloves was left behind by Wright on the arm of a couch near the victims' St. Petersburg home. Forensic tests of the glove by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement discovered DNA that belonged to Wright and no one else, according to an affidavit seen by the Tampa Bay Times. However, a follow up forensic test carried out by a Pennsylvania laboratory discovered DNA inside the glove from the two victims and none from Wright's DNA. Despite the conflicting reports, prosecutors claim that the glove's origin is key to the case. The glove 'is identical to a small number of gloves issued to the defendant's military police unit,' investigators wrote in a submitted report to the court. 'Those gloves, made of a flame-resistant material called Nomex, were kept in a locked storeroom at the base.' Paula O'Conner and baby Alijah were strangled and suffocated in their home in St. Petersburg, Florida, in July 2007 . Baby Alijah was born with an undetected heart defect and had to endure expensive open heart surgery and brain surgery to remedy his ailments . Baby Alijah after the surgery he underwent for his heart defect and the hydrocephalus he developed during the first 15-months of his life . According to a prosecution affidavit, Wright had access to that storeroom but no records show him checking out any gloves, but security video does show him entering the cupboard at 2 a.m. on July 6th, 2007, three hours before the murders were committed. Wright has pleaded innocent to the crimes and is being held without bail in the Pinellas County Jail in Florida. The former Reserve technical sergeant met O'Conner in January 2004 when she was single and working as an insurance underwriter. He said that he was divorced with a 10-year-old son when in fact he was still married with his own family in Orlando. However, O'Conner, who was 37 at the time of her death failed to ever meet any other family members of Wright's and he would often leave her for weeks at a time to go on 'secret assignment' for the military. When she became pregnant in 2005, Wright totally disappeared and O'Conner set up a website called Military Dead Beat Dads to tell her story and attempt to find him. On her web site O'Conner said she met wright in January 2004 when he introduced himself to her and they ended up going to dinner together. He told her that he was from Orlando and had worked as an Orange County deputy before being called up to active duty at MacDill Air Force base after 9/11 as a reservist. As a Reserve technical sergeant at MacDill, Wright was assigned guard duty and could drive law enforcement vehicles . Three weeks before the murders Wright was served with papers in the MacDill Air Force Base parking lot informing him that she was suing him for child support . She wrote that the relationship grew, 'We used to talk for hours on the phone...We just seemed to click, the only problem was that he worked nights at the base and I worked days, and he worked A LOT!' It was soon after they had picked out a ring together that Wright told her that he was being deployed for a secret assignment to the 'Horn of Africa.' Mugshot of Ralph 'Ron' Wright Jr after his arrest in 2008 for the murders of his mistress and the 15-month-old son they had together . 'He asked me if I would wait for him,' wrote O'Conner. 'I agreed. After all, I loved him. He said he loved me and that I was the only one for him.' When she informed Wright that she was pregnant, he disappeared and the son whom she called Alijah or A.J. was born on April 9th 2006. And almost immediately doctors told her the baby's heart had small holes in a lower chamber and a month later, he had open-heart surgery. Then, one month later, she notice her son's head had swollen and his eyes had begun to bulge. He was diagnosed with hydrocephalus, or excessive fluid on the brain and he had brain surgery. When O'Conner could not contact Wright she hired an attorney, John Tuthill and a private investigator who tracked Wright down and discovered he was married. Three weeks before the murders, O'Conner had Wright served with papers in the MacDill Air Force Base which informed him he was being sued for hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of medical bills and child support. 'He was fearful he was going to lose money in the process of having to support this child,' said St. Petersburg Police Department Major Mike Puetz at the time of Wright's arrest in December 2008. O'Conner and her child were discovered dead in the morning of July 6th, 2007 by her 18-year-old daughter and her boyfriend when she failed to show for work. During initial investigations by police in St. Petersburg, Wright denied ever having been romantically involved with O'Conner or indeed of being the boys father. He told authorities that he had only had a platonic relationship that had ended several years before her death and the he hadn't set foot in her house for years. Paula O'Conner and her son Alijah four months before they were murdered at home in Florida . Before he was charged, the police had attempted to obtain Wright's DNA but he refused, so when police used a tissue he had discarded after wiping a cut, they discovered that the child was his. To confirm this, they successfully obtained a court order for a saliva swab in early 2009. 'The basis for the arrest is DNA,' said Puetz. 'We did identify items of DNA in the home that are linked to Mr. Wright, and consequently, as a result of those matches, he was charged.' Wright's work history is checkered, with two failed stints working with law enforcement agencies. He spent seven months as a deputy with the Orange County Sheriff's Office, from August 1991 to March 1992 and his departure was labeled 'administrative-unfavorable' according to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. He also worked for the Eatonville Police Department from October 1994 to July 1996 and his employment ended there when he failed to complete mandatory training, said the FDLE. As a Reserve technical sergeant at MacDill, Wright was assigned guard duty and could drive law enforcement vehicles.","Paula O'Conner and her 15-month-old son Alijah were killed in July of 2007 at their St. Petersburg, Florida, home .

Two BP employees will plead guilty to manslaughter charges relating to the deaths of 11 people on the doomed Deepwater Horizon oil rig that spawned the catastrophic oil disaster in 2010. A federal indictment unsealed in New Orleans today claims BP well site leaders Robert Kaluza and Donald Vidrine acted negligently in their supervision of key safety tests performed on the rig before the explosion. The indictment says Kaluza and Vidrine failed to phone engineers onshore to notify them of problems in the drilling operation. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: Eleven workers were killed when the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico exploded and sparked the worst oil disaster in American history . Paying up: BP also agreed to pay the largest fine in U.S. history - a total of $4.5billion settlement with authorities for claims relating to the spill . Victims: Aaron Dale Burkeen, 37, pictured left, and Karl Kleppinger Jr, right, were among the dead . Blame: Two BP supervisors are now being held accountable for the deaths of the men on the Deepwater Horizon rig, including Jason Anderson, left, and Gordon Jones, right .

Jones, 28; Keith Blair Manuel, 56; Dewey A. Revette, 48; Shane . M. Roshto, 22, and Adam Weise, 24. Another indictment charges David . Rainey, who was BP's vice president of exploration for the Gulf of . Mexico, on charges of obstruction of Congress and false statements. The indictment claims the former . executive lied to federal investigators when they asked him how he . calculated a flow rate estimate for BP's blown-out well in the days . after the April 2010 disaster. The Britain-based oil giant also . agreed to pay the largest fine in U.S. history - a total of $4.5billion . settlement with authorities for claims relating to the spill.

BP . will pay the fine over six years after reaching a deal with the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) and the Securities and Exchange . Commission (SEC) that has seen it plead guilty to 14 criminal charges . relating to the oil rig accident in 2010, which dumped millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. Lives cut short: Donald Clark left behind a wife after the explosion, while Keith Blair Manuel, right, had three children . Loss: At 22, Shane Roshto was the youngest victim of the disaster . Tainted: The explosion caused the spill of more than 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico .

BP is hoping to wrap up its financial liabilities from the Deepwater Horizon disaster, but the overall impact on the Gulf Coast is still not known by researchers. Oil spewed into the Gulf of Mexico from the Macondo well for 87 days before it was finally capped. Some 68,000 square miles of the gulf were at one time covered in oil slick, about the area of Oklahoma. More than 6,000 seabirds, 600 turtles and 500 dolphins were found dead as a result of the spill. Many dolphins are still being found sick from apparent oil contamination and zooplankton have recently found to show traces of oil, as well. The full impact of the oil spill will not be estimated until the government releases its Natural Resource Damage Assessment, which will collect data from dozens of ongoing studies of the gulf. Mr Dudley said: 'All of us at BP . deeply regret the tragic loss of life caused by the Deepwater Horizon . accident as well as the impact of the spill on the Gulf coast region.' He added: 'Since the spill, we have worked hard to rebuild confidence in the company. 'We take seriously not only our . commitment to safety and operational excellence but also our . communications with stakeholders, including the public, the government . and our investors.' Today's settlement removes some of . the uncertainty hanging over the stock since the disaster, but it does . not cover outstanding civil claims against the group. BP said it will 'continue to vigorously defend itself' against civil claims and allegations of gross negligence. 'We are open to settlements, but only on reasonable terms,' said Mr Dudley. The deal could resolve a significant share of the liability that BP faces after an explosion killed 11 workers and fouled the shorelines of four Gulf Coast states in the worst offshore spill in U.S. history. BP still faces economic and environmental damage claims sought by U.S. Gulf Coast states and other private plaintiffs. It is unclear what form of criminal misconduct BP will plead guilty to. In an August filing, the Department of Justice said 'reckless management' of the Macondo well 'constituted gross negligence and willful misconduct,' which it intended to prove at a pending civil trial set to begin in New Orleans in February 2013. The U.S. government has not yet filed any criminal charges in the case. It is unclear whether the deal will resolve any civil charges brought by the Justice Department. It is also unclear how large a financial penalty BP might pay to resolve the charges, or other punishments that BP might face. Negligence is a central issue to BP's potential liability. A gross negligence finding could nearly quadruple the civil damages owed by BP under the Clean Water Act to $21billion in a straight-line calculation. Sickly: Thousands of birds, reptiles and dolphins died in the oil slick and many are still showing signs of contamination . According to the Justice Department, . errors made by BP and Swiss-based Transocean Ltd, owner of the Deepwater . Horizon platform, in deciphering a key pressure test of the Macondo . well are a clear indication of gross negligence. 'That such a simple, yet fundamental and safety-critical test could have been so stunningly, blindingly botched in so many ways, by so many people, demonstrates gross negligence,' the government said in its August filing. The mile-deep Macondo well spewed 4.9million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico over a period of 87 days. The torrent fouled shorelines from Texas to Florida and eclipsed Alaska's 1989 Exxon Valdez spill in severity. BP has already announced an uncapped class-action settlement with private plaintiffs that the company estimates will cost $7.8billion to resolve litigation brought by over 100,000 individuals and businesses claiming economic and medical damages from the spill.","Manslaughter charges stem from the death of 11 workers on the doomed Deepwater Horizon oil rig .

Several dozen residents of Boulder marched in a silent protest on Sunday, some blaring elk calls on their outstretched cell phones. The elk, who's affectionately known as 'Big Boy,' was shot dead by police officer Brent Curnow, who was later revealed to be the operator of a taxidermy website. Scroll down for video . Remembering Big Boy: A woman holds her cell phone, which is blaring elk sounds, as she participates in a walk to honor Big Boy the Elk, who was shot to death by a police officer on January 1 . Memorial: Dozens of people in Boulder, Colorado marched in a silent protest to remember Big Boy on Sunday . Probe: Boulder police officer Brent Curnow allegedly shot the elk and didn't report the killing while on-duty; he is now under investigation by the Colorado Parks & Wildlife department . Big Boy's death fueled massive public outcry after the officer claimed the elk was injured and he shot it to put the animal out of its misery, a claim neighbors in the Mapleton Hill area deny. 'We're concerned about the larger culture of misconduct that needs to be addressed in order for taxpaying voters to regain trust in the department,' a resident involved in the walk told CBS Denver. The officers were later identified as Curnow and Sam Carter, who have been suspended pending the results of an internal probe. On January 4, Boulder Police Chief Mark Beckner tweeted: 'Two officers involved in Elk shooting incident have been placed on Admin Leave w/pay pending the outcome of investigations.' Vigil: Hundreds of Boulder residents gathered last Sunday for a vigil to remember Big Boy . Guardian: The elk had been seen around the community for several days before he was shot . CBS Denver reported that the district attorney is preparing to file charges against the police officer who shot the famous elk. The walk was the latest in a series of events for Big Boy. Last week, the community held a candlelight vigil in his honor. The massive creature was described as their 'guardian' by some. Curnow has been with the department for 14 years, according to the Boulder Daily Camera. The officer, who is facing a criminal investigation by Colorado Parks and Wildlife, failed to report the kill. The Daily Camera revealed that Curnow also owns a taxidermy website. Spirit: Many admired the elk for its grace . The Estes Gazette reports that Curnow initially reported that he killed the creature because it was injured, not aggressive. His taxidermy website advertises 'quality taxidermy at an affordable price,' according to the paper. It is believed that Curnow and Carter were going to cut up the animal for its meat. There were mixed reports from Boulder residents that the bull elk had been behaving aggressively. Remembered: A mourner placed a framed picture of the elk on a Christmas tree .

Struck off: Care-home nurse Martha Sekete placed an elderly patient's hands on a scalding hot radiator and dragged another across the floor on a bed sheet . A vicious care-home nurse who placed an elderly patient's hands on a scalding hot radiator and dragged another across the floor on a bed sheet has been kicked out of the profession. Martha Sekete also snatched a sandwich from a male patient and threw it in the bin before shouting at him and grabbed a woman by her hair and neck to move her up the bed at Heath House in Birmingham. Sekete, who was said to have shown 'no remorse' for her actions was found guilty of a series of charges relating to four residents at the Southern Cross-owned home during a single night shift of November 5 and 6, 2009. After being placed on suspension Sekete visited the home of a fellow care assistant and asked her not to tell bosses what she had witnessed that night. A conduct and competence committee found  found Sekete guilty of misconduct, and determined that her fitness to continue practising as a nurse was impaired. Imposing a striking-off order, panel chair John Matharu said: 'The panel concluded that Ms Sekete's actions had put patients at unwarranted risk of harm, had brought the profession into disrepute, had breached fundamental tenets of the nursing profession and was dishonest. 'Ms Sekete has not demonstrated insight or remorse, or any recognition of the actual and potential consequences her actions could have had for service users. 'The panel is not aware of any steps she has taken to address and remedy those failings, or her underlying attitudinal problems. 'For these reasons, the panel concluded that there is a significant risk of Ms Sekete's actions being repeated in the future,' he added. Cassandra Scarborough, for the NMC, told the hearing: 'The charges in question all relate to elderly service users, three females and one male, and happened during the course of that night in November 2009.' Scene of the attack: Martha Sekete was found guilty of a series of charges relating to four residents at Heath House in Birmingham (pictured) The first incident was with service user A, who the registrant grabbed by her hair and neck while pulling her up in her bed.

Sekete was also found to have failed to tell her former bosses about a police caution that she received for assault in November 2005. She admitted going to see care assistant Sukhwinder Kaur after she was suspended, but denied telling her not to tell bosses what she had witnesses on the night of the shift in question.

From January 20, the programme will be broadcast in a new 60-minute format as Sunday Hour.

Anheuser-Busch InBev said Tuesday that is introducing a new specialty beer - an amber lager with a higher alcohol content - and will promote its new brew with a Super Bowl ad. The maker of Budweiser, Bud Light and other brews will launch Budweiser Black Crown with a 30-second ad on February 3 during Super Bowl 47, though the beer will be available in stores nationwide starting January 21. It will be sold in 12-ounce glass bottles in six- and 12-packs, and in 22-ounce single bottles. New contender? Budweiser Black Crown is brewer Anheuser-Busch's attempt to break into the specialty beer market . The launch comes a year after Anheuser-Busch InBev introduced Bud Light Platinum, another specialty beer, during the 2012 Super Bowl. Like Budweiser Black Crown, Bud Light Platinum has an alcohol content of 6 percent - Budweiser's is 5 percent. Benj Steinman, editor of Beer Marketer's Insights, said Anheuser-Busch InBev is seeking to compete with the large variety of specialty products now on the market. Though Budweiser outsells its four nearest competitors combined in what is known as the 'premium regular beer' market, that market isn't what it used to be. 'Budweiser peaked at 50 million barrels in 1988 - it's only about one-third of that at this point,' Steinman said. 'There's a constant desire among beer . consumers these days for innovation, flavor, variety. That's why . cocktails and spirits have gained strength.' Thanks to Budweiser (left), Anheuser-Bush outsells its four nearest competitors combined in the 'premium regular market' but demand for specialty beer is growing. Black Crown (right) is the brewer's reaction to this . Budweiser Black Crown's recipe resulted from a challenge to Anheuser-Busch InBev's 12 brewmasters, an effort dubbed Project 12, the company said. The brewmasters developed six beers, which customers sampled last year during a testing phase. The company received 25,000 opinions on the samples. The winning recipe came from Bryan Sullivan, a brewmaster in Los Angeles. 'As brewmasters we spend most of our time in the brewhouse,' Sullivan said. 'Project 12 gave us a chance to hear firsthand from the people we brew our beers for.' Company officials said Budweiser Black Crown blends two-row caramel malt with four types of domestic hops, finished on a bed of Beechwood chips. 'It stays true to the original Budweiser recipe but has its own unique take,' said Budweiser Black Crown's senior brand manager, Nate Scudieri. In addition to the 30-second Super Bowl spot, national advertising will include billboards, digital, radio and print, along with social media.","Budweiser Black Crown will be promoted during Superbowl show on February 3 .

Newcastle University has circulated a warning about 2CB via an email to students. It appears there may have been a party at . the terraced house in Ripon Gardens, a street popular with students at . the elite university. Bev Faulder, a teaching assistant, . said: ‘I heard them running around, shouting and carrying on.

There was a lot of boys’ banter.’ In November last year, the government banned mexxy and black mamba and made class B drugs. Mexxy, which is sold as an . alternative to ketamine was linked to two deaths and police have warned . of the 'life-threatening effects' of black mamba. A record 57 new legal highs were detected last year alone. An European Union report said it had found that more than one new psychoactive drug went on the market every week. Drug experts say while cocaine, ecstasy and amphetamines are the main players for those taking stimulants across Europe, they are now competing with a growing number of emerging synthetic drugs. A third added: ‘I thought they were that sort of thing because there were often strange smells coming from the house.’ 2CB is a Class A drug which often comes in purple capsules and is an hallucinogen related to ecstasy popular in Europe. It is also sold as white powder or small pills and is particularly dangerous when mixed with other substances. On the street, it is also known as Bromo, Nexus, CB, Performax, Spectrum, Venus, Erox or Cloud Nine. A team of ten police officers were seen searching the house and appeared to be looking in the drains. A .

Enraged: Robert Zimmerman Jr., pictured on Piers Morgan Tonight, launched a threatening Twitter tirade at the the Trayvon Martin family's attorneys . The older brother of George Zimmerman has launched a Twitter tirade on an attorney for Trayvon Martin's family, vowing to make it his life's work to disbar her. Robert Zimmerman Jr.'s rant followed a week of television interviews in which he protested the innocence of his brother, who stands accused of killing the unarmed teenager in February. The Zimmermans have been on a national media crusade over the past week - chatting with Piers Morgan and Spanish-speaking channels - to 'reintroduce' the family, who believe they have been misrepresented throughout the high-profile, divisive case. On Monday, Robert Zimmerman Jr. marked the end of his press tour by unleashing his anger at attorney Natalie Jackson, blaming her for the false portrayal of his family. 'I hope GOD grants you a long life so . you live to repent for what you have done,' he wrote on a tweet to her on Monday. He went on: 'My Life’s work = you WILL be held accountable for your words/actions. You AINT seen NOTHIN' yet... I will see U disbarred.' And, in a reference to what critics have dubbed the 'scheme team' behind the case - attorneys Jackson and Benjamin Crump and Orlando publicist Ryan Julison - he added: 'The Scheme will be exposed, one by one, day by day - SHAME on you.' Jackson quipped back: 'Please see my Rule #1: Never argue with a fool, onlookers may not be able to tell the difference - Mark Twain.' Scroll down for video . Anger: Zimmerman, the brother of George Zimmerman, directed messages at attorney Natalie Jackson . His emotional outburst underscores the trouble the family has faced controlling their image, and the struggle the defense team endures to keep their client and his family in line. Defense attorney Mark O'Mara told the Miami Herald that he . cringed when he saw the rant and that the media tour had gone ahead without George Zimmerman's knowledge. In their attempts to support their relative, the Zimmermans may be doing more harm than good, he suggested. 'I have been cautious with how we act in . this case and now someone with the same last name who does not act with . the same constraints is out there - and I have no control over him,' O'Mara said. Target: Natalie Jackson (centre) is representing the Martins with Daryl Parks (left) and Ben Crump (left) It is just another debacle for the defense team. They faced an early struggle after nationwide protests called for the arrest of Zimmerman, who they claimed attacked 17-year-old Trayvon because he was African American. After Zimmerman was released from prison after bailing himself out, he ended up back behind bars and on a new bail after the courts accused him about failing to reveal the extent of his legal funds. Then, last month, Zimmerman's best friend published a book full of errors about how Trayvon died - but ended up on the prosecution's evidence list, the Herald reported. Robert Zimmerman Jr., 31, decided to stand up for his family - who have all gone into hiding since the case arose - and travelled to Los Angeles last week to carry out interviews. Case: Neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, left, has been charged with second-degree murder for the February shooting of Trayvon Marton, right. He shot the teenager as he walked home . Family support: Robert Jr. has appeared on a number of TV and radio shows this week to speak against the portrayal of his brother and his family by the media . His aim, he said in an email to . reporters, was to 'reintroduce the Zimmerman family' and he was the only . person authorized to speak on their behalf. He went on to appear on radio and television shows in Los Angeles, where he painted his brother as a hard-working man attacked by the teenager and demonised by the media. He also appeared on Piers Morgan Tonight with his mother, who had her face obscured, before taking to his Twitter account for the attack on the Martin lawyer. In an email to the Herald, he stood by his rant, saying: 'I . don't want her to be able to use her position as an attorney to . assassinate anyone else's character or to ever hurt anyone else's . family.' Fight: Attorneys for Zimmerman said the Twitter rant will not have helped their already troubled case. Here, supporters of Trayvon Martin hold a rally in March, calling for Zimmerman's arrest . His brother, 29, has been charged with second-degree murder for the February 26 shooting in Sanford, Florida.

Nowadays the choice of televisions available almost rivals the number of channels viewers can watch. But despite the steady stream of plasma, flat screen and high-definition TVs on offer, more than 13,000 British householders still have black and white sets. Almost half a century after colour programmes were first beamed into British homes, people are still paying £49 a year for a licence to watch in monochrome. Despite the steady stream of plasma, flat screen and high-definition TVs on offer, more than 13,000 British householders still have black and white sets . The number of people with black and white licences - which are nearly £100 cheaper than the colour equivalent - has declined from 212,000 at the turn of the century to fewer than 50,000 in 2006. Last week that number had fallen to 13,202. Just over 2,700 monochrone licences are held in London, 574 in Birmingham, 413 in Manchester, and 256 in Glasgow. A spokesman for TV Licensing, the body that the BBC contracts to collect the fee, said the figure was ‘remarkable’ in the digital-only era. Iain Logie Baird, assistant curator at the National Media Museum in Bradford – and grandson of the inventor of television, John Logie Baird – said the black and white television has an enduring appeal. ‘There is a subsidy for people who still have black and white sets to keep using them, but there is a sense of nostalgia as well,’ he said. ‘The National Media Museum has hundreds of black and white television sets in its collection and I’m not surprised that people are still using them. Nowadays the choice of televisions available almost rivals the number of channels viewers can watch. While most people want to enjoy watching shows in colour on plasma screens, some prefer to revert back to the 1950s . ‘The cabinets on many of these are “retro” in their design, making them conversation pieces even when they aren’t switched on. It’s a bit like owning an antique car. ‘But perhaps most importantly, the television set has acted as a family gathering place in the home for decades now, well entrenched in our culture, and for a few who appreciate this fact, the old set can still hold a deep sentimental value.’ Television and radio technology historian John Trenouth said: ‘Although 13,202 monochrome licences may sound a lot, it’s now a tiny percentage of the 25 million licensed viewers in the UK. ‘The numbers of black and white TV sets in regular use has fallen dramatically over the last few years, hastened by the fact that it’s now almost impossible to replace them and by the need to buy a suitable set top box to continue to use them after digital switchover. ‘There will always be a small number of users who prefer monochrome images, don’t want to throw away a working piece of technology or collect old TV sets.’ Mr Logie Baird is not averse to the new technology. ‘I have a very big HD projector which I project onto the wall of my living room,’ he said. ‘I also own a cathode ray colour set from 1970, which even though not HD, is extremely watchable.’ Charles Francis Jenkins, one of the inventors of television . 1928 .

After years of innuendo, speculation and accusations, Lance Armstrong is to take the route of many a disgraced public figure and offer himself up for a no-holds-barred interview with Oprah Winfrey. A special 90-minute episode of 'Oprah's Next Chapter' will air on January 17th on Winfrey's OWN network and it is widely expected Armstrong, 41, will give an emotional account of the alleged doping scandal and use of performance enhancing drugs that has ruined his once glittering career. The timing of the interview at his home in Austin, Texas will raise eyebrows as it comes just days after reports suggested that the cyclist is considering admitting publicly that he consistently cheated throughout his decade at the top of his sport in which he became a hero to millions. Lance Armstrong speaking with Oprah Winfrey in 2005 - The one time cycling legend is to give his first ever no-hold-barred interview with the chat-show queen on January 17th . According to a release posted on . Oprah's website on Tuesday, it's the first interview with Armstrong . since his athletic career crumbled under the weight of a massive report . by USADA detailing allegations of drug use by the famous cyclist and . teammates on his U.S. Postal Service teams. It's . unclear if the interview at Armstrong's home in Austin, Texas, has . already been taped. Nicole Nichols, a spokeswoman for Oprah Winfrey . Network & Harpo Studios, declined comment. Armstrong . has strongly denied the doping charges that led to him being stripped . of his seven Tour de France titles, but The New York Times reported . Friday he has told associates he is considering admitting the use of . PEDS. The newspaper report . cited anonymous sources, and Armstrong attorney Tim Herman told The . Associated Press that night that he had no knowledge of Armstrong . considering a confession. Earlier . Tuesday, '60 Minutes Sports' reported the head of the U.S. Anti-Doping . Agency told the show a representative for Armstrong offered the agency a . 'donation' in excess of $150,000 several years before an investigation . by the organization led to the loss of Armstrong's Tour de France . titles. In an interview for . the premiere airing on Showtime on Wednesday night, USADA CEO Travis . Tygart said he was 'stunned' when he received the offer in 2004. Lance Armstrong has agreed to a tell-all interview with Oprah Winfrey where he will address allegations that he used performance-enhancing drugs during his cycling career . 'It was a clear conflict of interest for USADA,' Tygart said. 'We had no hesitation in rejecting that offer.' Herman denied such an offer was made. 'No truth to that story,' Herman wrote Tuesday in an email to the AP. 'First Lance heard of it was today. He never made any such contribution or suggestion.' Tygart was traveling and did not respond to requests from the AP for comment. USADA spokeswoman Annie Skinner said Tygart's comments from the interview were accurate. In it, he reiterates what he told the AP last fall: That he was surprised when federal investigators abruptly shut down their two-year probe into Armstrong and his business dealings, then refused to share any of the evidence they had gathered. 'You'll have to ask the feds why they shut down,' Tygart told the AP. 'They enforce federal criminal laws. We enforce sports anti-doping violations. They're totally separate. We've done our job.' Lance Armstrong is expected to deliver candid and clear comments on the allegations of performance enhancing drug use that have dogged his entire career and subsequent retirement . This dramatic news comes just two days after it was reported that Armstrong may be considering a change in course, dropping his years of denials and admitting that he used performance-enhancing drugs - even though such a move might be unwise. The New York Times, citing anonymous sources, reported late Friday that Armstrong has told associates he is thinking about the move. However, Armstrong attorney Tim Herman says that the cyclist hasn't reached out to USADA chief executive Travis Tygart and David Howman, director general of the World Anti-Doping Agency. A USADA spokeswoman declined comment on Saturday, while Howman was quoted by the Sunday Star-Times in New Zealand, where he is vacationing, saying Armstrong has not approached his group. Armstrong's attorney, Tim Herman, denied such an offer was made, saying: 'No truth to that story. First Lance heard of it was today. He never made any such contribution or suggestion' USADA stripped Armstrong of his seven . Tour de France titles last year and issued a report portraying the . cyclist as the leader of a sophisticated doping operation on his winning . teams. Public confessions and apologies have been the route of redemption for several athletes who have gotten in trouble. For example, Tiger Woods said he was . sorry for cheating on his wife in televised speech, and baseball slugger . Mark McGwire eventually admitted to steroid use. Yet Armstrong faces . serious legal entanglements those megastars didn't, and a confession to . doping could end up complicating matters for Armstrong - not making them . easier. The U.S. Department of Justice is . considering whether to join a federal whistle-blower lawsuit filed by . former Armstrong teammate Floyd Landis alleging fraud against the U.S. Postal Service during the years the agency sponsored Armstrong's teams. A Dallas-based promotions company has . also said it wants to recover several million dollars paid to Armstrong . in bonuses for winning the Tour de France. And the British newspaper The . Sunday Times is suing to recover about $500,000 paid to Armstrong to . settle a libel lawsuit. Despite damning evidence Armstrong has yet to admit any wrongdoing although that could be about to change . Armstrong has testified under oath . that he never used performance-enhancing drugs, which could . theoretically lead to charges if he confessed. Former U.S. track star . Marion Jones spent several months in federal prison for lying to . investigators about her drug use. And after so many years of vehement . denials and sworn statements that he never doped, at this point, what . would Armstrong gain from a confession? There would be no guarantee that . his personal sponsors would return or that the public would accept it. Is the public even interested in an Amrstrong confession? Gene Grabowski, executive vice . president of Levick, a Washington, D.C.-based crisis and issues . management firm, said 'it may be too little, too late because he's been . denying it for so long.' A confession would only work to . salvage Armstrong's reputation if he accepted full responsibility and . blamed no one else, Grabowski said. And it would have to include some . public act of atonement. 'If he does all three, he has a shot,' Grabowski said. 'You have to show people you are willing to pay a price.' The New York Times reported the . 41-year-old Armstrong may be considering a confession in an attempt to . reduce his lifetime ban from cycling and Olympic sport so he can return . to competing in triathlons and elite running events. Armstrong lost most of his personal . sponsorship worth tens of millions of dollars after USADA issued its . report and he left the board of the Livestrong cancer-fighting charity . he founded in 1997. He is still worth about a reported $100 million. Livestrong might be one reason to . issue an apology. The charity supports cancer patients and still faces . an image problem because of its association with its famous founder. And if Armstrong did confess, the corporate sponsors who abandoned him might support him again, Grabowski said. More allegations: The chief of the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency said that a representative for Armstrong offered the agency in excess of $150,000 several years before the doping investigation . Armstrong was accused last October of running 'the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen' 'They'll do what the public does,' Grabowski said. Betsy Andreu, the wife of former . Armstrong teammate Frankie Andreu, was one of the first to publicly . accuse Armstrong of using performance-enhancing drugs. She dismissed a potential confession from Armstrong as self-serving and too late. 'Sorry, your chance is over. You're . banned for life. It's not with an asterisk, that because you are Lance . Armstrong you get to come back,' Andreu said. 'He does not belong in . sport.' According to the code, an athlete might be eligible for a reduced punishment if he fully confesses and details how he doped, who helped him dope and how he got away with doping. Armstrong has been keeping a low profile since doping revelations ruined his once illustrious career and reputation. In November he was spotted canoeing in the warm Pacific waters just off Hawaii. The holiday island has become a regular destination for Armstrong to seek refuge, as he throws himself into training for Ironman Triathlon events. An Ironman Triathlon consists of a . 2.4-mile swim, a 112-mile bicycle ride and a marathon 26.2-mile run, . raced in that order and without a break. Most Ironman events have a . strict time limit of 17 hours to complete the race.","Lance Armstrong is to take the route of .

"By . Eloise Horsfield and Claire Bates . UPDATED: . 08:57 EST, 23 November 2011 . A former British hotel owner who retired to Spain with her husband has died after contracting a deadly disease from a sandfly. Susan Hughes, 67, from Enfield, in North London, moved to Malaga in 2004 with her husband Tony to enjoy an early retirement after running a hotel in North Wales. But in August this year the mother-of-two contracted black fever - a rare . parasitic disease, after she was bitten by a sandfly. Susan Hughes, 67, had retired to Malaga with her husband Tony when she suddenly fell ill. Mrs Hughes was taken to a nearby hospital where doctors couldn't diagnose her condition and put her in isolation . 'She felt very ill so we went to see her local GP,' Mr Hughes said. 'Her temperature was very high and we knew something was wrong.' Mrs . Hughes was rushed to A&E at Velez Malaga hospital where . doctors couldn't diagnose her condition and put her in isolation. Blood samples were then sent to Barcelona. When they were returned a week later they revealed that Mrs Hughes had visceral leishmaniasis or black fever. 'They knew what they were up against after that,' said Mr Hughes. Retired in Spain: Susan Hughes pictured with her daughter Sharon Phoenix, 42, and grandchildren Teddy, 4, and Billy, 7 . Black fever is a common killer in the Indian subcontinent, which accounts for more than 90 per cent of cases. It can also occur in southern Europe although there are only a handful of cases each year and few fatalities. Deadly: It is the female sandfly which transmits the bacterial infection between hosts . It is usually transmitted through the bite of female sandflies with . symptoms typically emerging a few weeks afterwards. These include . fatigue, weight-loss and fever followed by an outbreak skin sores. There . are no vaccines or drugs to prevent infection, but treatments include . the anti-fungal drug Amphotericin B. The disease if fatal if untreated . and those with suppressed immune systems are most at risk. She was given a blood transfusion because the parasite had got into her blood, but doctors were unable to save her. She died on September 11, leaving her husband and a son and daughter from a previous marriage. Mrs Hughes had a compromised immune system because she was taking anti-rejection drugs for a liver transplant she received in 1983. 'They tried everything but she couldn’t fight it because her immune system was low,' Mr Hughes said. Over . the last few days she developed black blotches on her arms and chest . and scabs on the roof of her mouth – typical symptoms of the deadly . disease. 'She was delirious towards the end because her temperature . was over 40. The doctors said she died of septicaemia in the end,' said . Mr Hughes. Doctors said it was likely the . sandfly picked up the disease from an infected dog, although tests from . the couple's pet came back negative. The couple, who had run a hotel together in Llandudno, had lived in a caravan for their first two years in Spain while their dream home was being built in Malaga. 'It’s just a shame we came to Spain . for a good life, and yet if we’d stayed in the UK she’d have still been . alive,' said Mr Hughes. 'She did have a chance to enjoy it and we had a good life together. It’s just a shame it was so short.' Mr Hughes met his wife in Wolverhampton in 1983, just months before she had the liver operation that was to grant her 28 extra years of life. At 39, she’d been given just six weeks to live but was handed a second chance through the transplant. 'I thought she had a very good suntan, but she was actually jaundiced because of the cirrhosis,' said Mr Hughes. After the operation the couple had a happy life together, running a hotel for many years before their retirement.","'It’s just a shame we came to Spain .

A postman has won his legal battle with Royal Mail after he fell and hurt his shoulder because his boots were too slippery. Clive Davey, 47, of Ipswich, Suffolk, is one of 15 postmen across the country who took legal action against their employer after being issued with the new footwear in 2007. He was given £2,228 after he slipped and fell on a manhole cover 45 minutes after he put on the boots for the first time. Payout: Clive Davey, 47, won compensation from Royal Mail after he fell because of faulty boots he was given . 'My shoes and boots are the most important . piece of equipment a mailman has,' he said. 'I don't think it is too much to ask that they are well made and safe to wear.' Hampshire postman Patrick Bitton was the first to take Royal Mail to court after he slipped and fracture his ankle while wearing the Magnum Boots. After a four-day trial last summer, a judge at Winchester Crown Court ruled in his favour and he was awarded £3,600. Royal Mail then decided to settle the remaining 14 cases, including Mr Davey's, outside court. Mr Davey said: 'For the first three years I worked for Royal Mail I was happy with the equipment but then they decided to introduce the Magnum Boots. 'Almost straight away I heard how colleagues were having problems with them so I refused to wear them. 'But my manager insisted and so I gave in.' Claims: Mr Davey is one of 15 postmen from across the country to take legal action against Royal Mail because of the faulty boots (file picture) Mr Davey, who still delivers in Stowmarket, said he had previously had surgery on his shoulder and is now considered partially disabled after the fall aggravated the injury. Helen Stanton, of law firm Simpson Millar, which handled the cases, said: 'Despite the fact that Royal Mail's own independent assessments showed that the footwear was dangerous, the company still denied liability and dragged these cases out for years. 'Only after a judge decided in the favour or its employees did Royal Mail agree to settle the remaining 14 cases. 'It is a positive outcome but the company could have saved itself a lot of time and money, not to mention the goodwill of its staff had it acknowledged its responsibility sooner.' A Royal Mail spokesman said: 'The safety of our employees is a top priority for Royal Mail. 'A range of boots and shoes are available for our people and these are regularly updated based on the latest designs available. 'As a result, the boots that were available five years ago are no longer used by our postmen and women.'","Clive Davey, 47, slipped 45 minutes after putting on new footwear .

Billodeaux, who is of Laotion descent, ran into a showing of Les Miserables at the Reading Cinemas Carmel Mountain after he allegedly got into a fight with his girlfriend in the parking lot. A bystander saw him threatening his girlfriend with a gun, and when the bystander went to intervene, Billodeaux turned the gun towards him. San Diego police armed with assault rifles stormed the cinema and went theater-to-theater looking for Billodeaux.

An elderly couple today told of the terrifying moment masked robbers broke into their home and threatened to cut off their hands if they didn't hand over their cash and jewellery. Harry Carrick, 78 and Sylvia Everett, 75, were enjoying a quiet night in with the television and a crossword when three men wearing balaclavas burst into their home in Cleadon, South Tyneside, just after 6pm on Saturday night. The masked men rammed pillowcases over their heads before binding their arms and pushing them to the floor. Horrific injuries: The severe bruising sustained by Harry Carrick, 78, after he and his partner Sylvia Everett, 75, were tied up by masked robbers who burst into their home in Cleadon, South Tyneside, on Saturday . They then ransacked the house - stealing £25,000 worth of jewellery and cash during the hour-long ordeal. Frail Mr Carrick, who suffers from asthma and had only been out of hospital two days after undergoing treatment for a serious chest infection, suffered painful bruising in the attack. The great-grandparents have today spoken out in the hope people will come forward with information as detectives continue to hunt for the culprits. Mrs Everett, who used to own a post office in Nottingham before selling up in the early 90s, said: 'I was sitting doing the crossword and Harry was eating some ginger snaps with his coffee and watching television when these three thugs with balaclavas and pillowcases in their hands came running in the house. I thought it was some kind of joke. 'They shouted at me to ""shut my mouth"" and used the most foul language. 'They yanked the jewellery off my neck. I pleaded for them to at least leave my locket that I've worn for 20 years, but they shouted at me to shut up or they would ""kick my head in"". 'They shoved the pillowcases over our heads and tied my hands and feet, it was really tight and cutting into my wrists. 'He said they knew we had a safe and wanted to know where it was. Then they told Harry if he didn't get the key to the safe they'd cut my fingers off. 'Initially we said we didn't have one but Harry said ""Sylvia, just give them the key"". 'They then used a crowbar to get access to the safe which had money in from when I sold my post office.' The couple were then told to stay in the corridor, as two of the men left to search the property while one stayed behind - threatening to slice off Mrs Everett's ears if they made a sound. Mrs Everett continued: 'They kept us there for about an hour while they went through the whole house. At one point I could hear the sound of a bag being unzipped. I thought they were going to put our bodies in it. I thought we were going to die.' The raiders also ransacked the couple's bedroom - taking about £25,000 worth of jewellery - and a quantity of cash the couple had put aside to buy a new car. Mr Carrick, a retired railways worker, added: 'I had to tell them where the safe was, they said they were going to cut her fingers off and I believe they would have done. 'I feel like moving away from here, but Sylvia loves this bungalow and I'm not going to let them get the better of me.' When the robbers finally fled, Mr Carrick was able to wriggle his hands free and the couple dialled 999. The police were on the scene within minutes and used police dogs to try to catch the men's trail. The couple, who met on a cruise after the deaths of their previous spouses, moved into the street 20 years ago, where houses sell for up to three quarters of a million pounds. Within weeks they had been targeted by thieves, who used glass-cutting equipment to remove a section of a window and sneak in without the couple realising, taking almost all of Ms Everett's jewellery and family heirlooms. They were also broken into at the end of November last year, but were out at the time and believe the alarm caused the thieves to flee empty-handed. Mrs Everett said: 'This is the fifth time we've been burgled. I don't understand why this keeps on happening to us. 'It's horrific what we've been through, I am totally in shock. I don't swear, but they are absolute scum. 'What kind of person threatens to cut someone's ears and fingers off? I felt like saying to them ""would you like someone doing this to your mother?""' A spokesman for Northumbria Police said: 'At 7.40pm on Saturday police received a report of a burglary at a home in Cleadon Village. 'An elderly couple had been tied up and threatened during the burglary when three men forced their way into the couple's home. The couple were checked over by paramedics but did not require hospital treatment. 'A large amount of cash and jewellery was taken and a police investigation is under way to trace the offenders.' Acting Inspector Nick Gjorven of Northumbria Police South Tyneside Area Command added: 'This was a distressing incident for the occupants and we're carrying out inquiries to find those responsible. 'We have a number of officers on patrol in the local area to reassure residents and if anyone has any information I'd urge them to contact us.'","Harry Carrick, 78 and Sylvia Everett, 75, were attacked on Saturday night .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . UPDATED: . 03:04 EST, 3 November 2011 . A bizarre pre-historic mammal that looked just like the fictional sabre-toothed squirrel in the Ice Age movies has been unearthed in South America. The primitive mouse-sized creature lived among the dinosaurs up to 100million years ago and sported a snout, very long teeth and large eyes - just like popular animated character Scrat. Its discovery in Argentina bridges a gap of about 60million years in the mammalian fossil record on the continent and provides an insight into a largely unexplored period. Exceptional discovery: An artist's impression of the prehistoric mammal that resembles a type of sabre-tooth squirrel that was found in Argentina. The fossil remains reveal previously unknown dental and cranial features . It was a palaeontologist, Dr Guillermo Rougier, of Louisville University, Kentucky, who said the species - named Cronopio dentiacutus after its sharp teeth - bears a striking resemblance to Scrat . The animal, identified after skulls and jaws were dug up, was a dryolestoid - a group of extinct mammals that led to a large and diverse variety of animals including kangaroos, elephants and even humans. They are known mainly from teeth and jaws found in the US and Europe, although they also thrived in South America where their lack of remains has made it hard to study their origin and early diversification. Bizarre: The newly discovered species bears more than a passing resemblance to Scrat, the sabre-toothed squirrel from the Ice Age movies . Palaeontologist Dr Guillermo Rougier, . of Louisville University, Kentucky, said the species - named Cronopio . dentiacutus after its sharp teeth - bears a striking resemblance to . Scrat in the Ice Age films. The . remains, described in the journal Nature, included two partial skulls . and jaws showing previously unknown dental and cranial features such as . single-rooted molars preceded by double-rooted pre-molars. Ice Age tells the story of a human infant who is found by a group of animals that includes a woolly mammoth, a sabre-toothed tiger, and a pair of giant sloths and tries to reunite him with his parents . These . were combined with a very long muzzle, exceedingly long teeth and . evidence of highly specialised jaws. They were found in the Patagonian . province of Rio Negro in Argentina. Dr Rougier said: 'Dryolestoids are an extinct mammalian group belonging to the lineage leading to modern marsupials and placentals.' In the Ice Age films, Scrat was intent on hiding his acorn and keeping it from predators and forms part of a mismatched gang of animals who take it on themselves to return a human infant to its tribe before the cold weather sets in. Dr Christian de Muizon, of the National History Museum in Paris who reviewed the paper for the journal, said the fossils were 'remarkably complete'. He said: 'Mammalian remains from the age of the dinosaurs - the Mesozoic era, from 250million years to 65million years ago - are rare. 'Ten times fewer mammalian genera have been identified from the Mesozoic than from the age of mammals that followed it - the Cenozoic era, from roughly 65.5million years ago to the present - even though the Cenozoic has lasted less than half the time. 'Furthermore, Mesozoic mammals are most often known from isolated teeth or partial jaws; complete skulls and/or skeletons are exceptional.'","Mouse-sized creature found in Argentina scurried among dinosaurs 100million years ago .

Tragic: Chevonea Kendall-Bryan fell to her death at her Battersea home in March 2011 . A bullied 13-year-old schoolgirl who fell 60ft to her death slipped in a 'ghastly accident' and did not intend to kill herself, a coroner said today. Chevonea Kendall-Bryan plunged from her bedroom window on the top floor of Seldon House in Battersea, south-west London, in March last year. An inquest heard how the schoolgirl had been forced into performing sex acts on two boys at a party just a month earlier and was begging a teenage boy to delete the mobile phone footage of the incident when she fell. Coroner Bernard Richmond QC said he believes Chevonea was leaning out of the window to convince one of the boys, known as E6, she would jump if he did not erase the mobile phone footage. But he believes she never intended to follow her threat through. 'It is clear that Chevonea was of the view that there was a video, and that video was under the control of, or certainly could be influenced by E6', he told Westminster Coroners Court. 'We have the text where she is begging him to delete the video. 'I suspect strongly what happened is Chevonea was saying to him something along the lines of it will finish her off if the video gets out. 'His approach was to be unsympathetic, or to be, as he thought, funny, or maybe being unkind - who knows? 'In any event, he was not giving her reassurance she needed, and she was trying very hard to demonstrate how serious the fact was that this will ""kill her"". 'The most likely explanation is she was trying to persuade him she would do something to herself. 'She probably thought she could lean out of the window, and she toppled over. 'This was a ghastly, ghastly accident.' The fall: A coroner today said he believed Chevonea's 60ft fall from her bedroom window on the top floor of this block of flats in Battersea was a 'ghastly' accident and not intentional . Following five days of evidence, Mr Richmond concluded he does not think Chevonea leapt to her death deliberately. 'I am certainly not going to find it was suicide', he said. 'I don't believe, however difficult things were, that Chevonea would deliberately have taken her own life. 'If she was going to kill herself, I honestly don't think she would have chosen a way which caused her family so much distress. 'I don't even begin to get close.' Chevonea was bullied mercilessly by fellow pupils at St Cecilia's School in Wandsworth, south London, for nearly three years before her death. She cut herself at least three times in school and is said to have tried to swallow a handful of paracetamol tablets during class. Mr Richmond has identified a catalogue of failures by the school in not helping Chevonea, and even when she was referred to Wandsworth Council social services, her plight was largely ignored. Tragic: The girl's mother Amanda Kendall, left, has spoken of her heartbreak at the death of Chevonea, right . Just a month before her death, on March 29, 2011, Chevonea told teachers she had been forced to perform oral sex on two boys. She said a boy known as TG had raped her after a party, and the following day E6 threatened to throw a brick through her window if she did not repeat the act on him. TG is thought to have filmed Chevonea performing the sex act on E6, though the schoolgirl only learnt of the footage just hours before her death. Both boys gave evidence to the inquest, denying all knowledge of the sex tape and claiming neither had sexual or physical contact with Chevonea. But Mr Richmond branded them liars, and said E6, who was outside Chevonea's home when she fell, knew full well what had happened that day but had not told the inquest. 'They deliberately lied about what they know', he said. 'I will find as a matter of fact that TG and E6 lied. 'I am quite satisfied that E6 saw Chevonea fall, quite satisfied that TG knows E6, that the video of sex activity involved Chevonea, and that TG filmed it.' Chevonea's neighbour Richard Umunegbu said he heard E6 cry 'this was not meant to happen' moments after the teenager fell. Despite concluding that E6 had withheld the truth, Mr Richmond said he does not think the boy, now 16, had egged on Chevonea to jump from the window. 'I don't think for a second there is anything about E6 that he would counsel someone to kill themselves', he said. 'His silences were profound, he knew plenty of what was going on but also he was profoundly affected by what happened.' Adjourning the hearing, the coroner praised Chevonea's family for sitting stoically through five days of evidence. 'I thank Chevonea's family for their consistent support of this inquiry, and for conducting themselves with such dignity', he said. The inquest will reconvene on Wednesday, January 16, at 9am, for Mr Richmond to sum up the evidence before presenting his official verdict. He is expected the record a narrative verdict which rules out suicide and suggests Chevonea, of Battersea Park, south London, fell to her death accidentally.

Russian scientists are celebrating successfully bringing up a sample from an Antarctic lake that has been buried beneath ice for at least 100,000 years. The announcement was made just weeks after a British expedition to extract water from an Antarctic lake gave up and headed for home. The Russian team initially drilled more than two miles into ice to reach the surface of Lake Vostock last year. The Russian expedition posing after breaking through to Lake Vostock in 2012. They managed to bring up a sample, some of which was served to President Vladimir Putin, but it was uncertain if the water can from the lake or the glacier above it. Having returned to Antarctica the scientific team extracted a further sample which, according to the Russian state-owned news agency Ria Novosti, was from the lake itself. The project team relied on the huge pressure the lake is under to force water up into last year’s borehole where it froze and could be extracted in cores, it was reported. ‘The first core of transparent lake ice, 2 meters long, was obtained on January 10 [2013] at a depth of 3,406 meters,’ the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute, part of the Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring, was quoted as saying. ‘Inside it was a vertical channel filled with white bubble-rich ice.’ The core is now to be tested to see if any microbial life has persisted Lake Vostock, which at 1,300 cubic miles in volume is the largest lake in Antarctica and one of the biggest in the world. There are more than 400 sub-glacial lakes in Antarctica and they are attracting scientific attention in part because they represent environments similar to those that might harbour life elsewhere in the solar system, such as Jupiter's frozen moon Europa. Analysis of samples from last year’s Lake Vostock expedition yielded nothing alive except for a few microbes which are feared to have been through contamination. The British Antarctic Survey gave up its attempt to break through to Lake Ellsworth in December. However, a US-led Antarctic expedition announced in November that they had detected microbes thriving in the slushy centre of the otherwise frozen Lake Vida. The microbes had been sealed off by ice for at least 2,800 years and were living without oxygen in salty, acidic water which would be toxic to many lifeforms. In Lake Vostock any microbes would have to have survived frozen beneath ice for at least 100,000 years and perhaps for millions of years. In December the British Antacrtic Survey had to abandon an attempt to reach Lake Ellsworth through almost 1.8 miles of ice by drilling with water at close to boiling point. It was defeated by technical problems at it tried to link the main borehole with a secondary hole that was to be used to syphon off water.","Lake Vostock is buried more than two miles below the surface .

Medics used the rare treatment on Ronald Aldom to induce a controlled heart attack, after they realised they could not safely perform standard procedures on him. Cardiologist Dr Tom Johnson said his 77-year-old patient would have died without the procedure. Roland Aldom raises a toast with his wife Pam to the doctors who saved his life . Mr Aldom was suffering from a life-threatening disruption to his heart rhythm called ventricular tachycardia (VT) - which occurred as a result of a previous heart attack. The team decided to treat Mr Aldom, from Portishead near Bristol, with 'ethanol ablation'. The treatment has only been conducted a handful of times in the UK to treat VT, Dr Johnson said. The procedure involves passing a catheter to the heart from the groin which identifies which part of the heart the dangerous rhythms are coming from. A tiny balloon is then blown up in . the heart artery supplying that area and a small amount of absolute . alcohol is injected into the artery to produce a small controlled heart . attack. Roland was suffering from a life threatening disruption to his heart rhythm . This kills the area of the heart muscle causing the problem allowing the heart's rhythm to return to normal. Mr Aldom said he was admitted to hospital after his implantable defibrillator (ICD) gave him a ""thunderstorm of shocks"". Dr Johnson, an interventional . cardiologist, said: 'Mr Aldom presented a couple of months ago with this . life-threatening type rhythm disturbance, VT, which was related to the . damage done to the heart - the scar associated with his previous heart . attack. 'The . defibrillator is there to try and prevent you from dropping dead in the . community - they listen out for the heart doing unusual things - if your . heart is doing something unusual like going very, very fast, firstly it . will try and pace you out of that rhythm - it will try and suppress the . activity within the heart. 'If . that fails it will actually illicit a shock of energy across the heart . which hopefully straightens things out and puts you back into a normal . rhythm. 'It is potentially a rather difficult . thing for a patient to live with because there is that threat that it . could go off and actually when it does go off it is like being kicked in . the chest.' Mr Aldom . added: 'I was admitted to the Bristol Heart Institute after what doctors . described as a thunderstorm of shocks from my ICD.

While HRT is very effective, Dr Tong says soy, red clover and black cohosh, can also be very effective in relieving menopausal symptoms . Herbal and complementary medicines are a viable alternative to hormone replacement therapy for postmenopausal women who fear the possible side effects, according to new research. Soy for instance, the most common plant containing oestrogen, can reduce hot flushes by more than half, says a scientist who carried out a review into previous studies. Red clover, a legume also containing the female hormone, and black cohosh, a plant originating in the US and Canada, also ease symptoms. Women's primary care specialist Dr Iris Tong, of Brown University, Rhode Island, who led the review, said: 'Up to 75 per cent of women use herbal and complimentary medicines to treat their postmenopausal symptoms. 'Therefore, it is vitally important for healthcare providers to be aware of and informed about the non-pharmacological therapies available for women who are experiencing postmenopausal symptoms and who are looking for an alternative to HRT.' The menopause is associated with an oestrogen deficiency and can cause an increase in hot flushes, vaginal dryness, sexual dysfunction, frequent urinary tract infections, urinary incontinence and joint pain as well as sleep and mood disturbance. About two in three postmenopausal women experience hot flushes and a fifth for up to 15 years, writes Dr Tong in the journal The Obstetrician and Gynaecologist (TOG). Oestrogen deficiency can also lead to cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis and while many drugs are available, a number of non-pharmacological alternatives are sometimes preferred. Dr Tong found HRT is the most effective treatment of hot flushes, improving symptoms in 80 to 90 per cent of women. Oestrogen deficiency after the meonpause can cause sleep and mood disturbance, hot flushes and frequent urinary tract infections, amongst other things . But she says there are possible . health risks associated with HRT such as links to breast cancer, blood . clots, stroke and cardiovascular problems. Dr Tong said due to these possible . risks, other treatment options may be equally effective such as . behaviour modification and herbal and complimentary medicines. The review states that as many as 50 to 75 per cent of postmenopausal women use herbal options to treat hot flushes, and of the complimentary therapies, soy, red clover and black cohosh have been the most investigated. Soy, found naturally in food and supplements, has shown a reduction in hot flush symptoms ranging between 20 to 55 per cent. Dr Tong recommends it, as well as red clover and black cohosh, as there are no significant adverse side effects associated with them, as long as they are used in women with no history of breast cancer, are not at high risk for breast cancer and are not taking tamoxifen. But she warns herbal medicines are not regulated in many countries, and therefore the contents of a given product may vary from sample to sample. TOG's editor in chief Jason Waugh added: 'Postmenopausal symptoms can be very distressing and it is important to review the advantages and limitations of the non pharmacological treatments available as well as the pharmacological ones. 'Even simple behaviour modification can make a difference to postmenopausal symptoms, including keeping the room temperature cool, wearing layered clothing, relaxation techniques and smoking cessation.'","Women's health specialist Dr Iris Tong agrees HRT is very effective at reducing symptoms .

Around 50,000 criminals who were spared jail went on to commit another crime within a year, figures revealed yesterday. The convicts – including violent thugs, burglars and drug dealers – were handed community service or a suspended jail term, leaving them free to commit new crimes. Within 12 months, a total of 49,636 offenders who were not put behind bars were convicted of another offence. Had they been jailed, they would have been unable to offend again. Plans: The Justice Secretary is set to announce that charities and businesses can play a role in to reduce reoffending . Re-offend: A total of 49,636 offenders not put behind bars were convicted of another offence within 12 months . Tory MPs said the ‘shocking’ figures showed a failure by probation officials to get a grip on criminals they were supposed to be reforming. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling is set to announce within weeks that charities and businesses will be brought in to tackle entrenched reoffending as part of the ‘rehabilitation revolution’. Yesterday he said the majority of probation work would be outsourced. Charities and firms will be ‘paid by results’ – and required to hit fixed targets for cutting re-offending. Tory MP Priti Patel said: ‘These are quite shocking figures. They demonstrate the true extent of reoffending. ‘There is clearly a problem with the probation service which is not working well to deal with this issue. ‘I have no doubt that the Secretary of State will look at this problem with a matter of urgency to tackle this appalling cycle of reoffending.’ Rehabilitation: Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has announced new plans to tackle reoffending . Figures published by the Ministry of Justice show that 49,636 criminals given court orders in 2010 – suspended sentences or community service – committed another crime within 12 months. The true level of reoffending is likely to be higher given the number of criminals whose crimes go undetected. Of the total, 13,114 had been convicted of violent crimes, 3,621 of burglary and 222 of robbery. Another 433 were sex offenders, including 144 convicted of sexual offences involving children.Some 12,778 were guilty of theft, 915 of drug dealing offences and 2,599 convicted of criminal damage. More than 1,000 were guilty of forgery or fraud and 1,165 of handling stolen goods. Yesterday Mr Grayling told the House of Commons that charities would pay a major role in payment-by-results schemes. A consultation on the proposals will be published in the New Year. Criminals who are sentenced to less than 12 months, who currently do not have probation support, will be dealt with under the new arrangements. Serious offenders will remain under the old system. Mr Grayling told MPs: ‘I intend to apply payment by results to the majority of rehabilitation work conducted with offenders in the community. ‘This rehabilitation revolution will stimulate innovation and open the delivery of services to a wider range of providers with the skills needed to change the individual’s behaviour and reduce offending in the future.’ Labour spokesman Andy Sawford said the introduction of payment by results could be ‘damaging’ to offender management. He compared the prospect of outsourcing probation to the use of private companies testing benefit claimants to see if they are fit to work. Unions are campaigning against the changes, arguing privatisation would be a ‘race to the bottom at the expense of effectiveness and efficiency’. Harry Fletcher, assistant general secretary of Napo, the probation workers’ union, has said privatisation ‘flies in the face of all the available evidence’.

Millions of workers with final salary pensions face tax rises to pay for a new universal flat pension. The Coalition has agreed to overhaul the complicated pensions system and replace it with a flat retirement income of around £155 a week from 2017. But some workers will have to pay hundreds more every year because they will no longer be able to opt out of the state second pension, which is to be scrapped. Hike: Millions of middle-class earners in the UK could face higher national insurance contributions as a result of government plans to introduce a new single-tier pensions system . The six million workers who currently opt out will be left paying an extra 1.4 per cent in national insurance contributions. Those earning £40,000 a year will pay an annual extra £481 under the new system, while those on the average salary of around £25,000 will fork out an extra £270, according to financial firm Hargreaves Lansdown. Most of the workers on final salary schemes work in the public sector. Around 1.4million are in the private sector – usually long-serving employees of large firms. Increase: Financial services firm Hargreaves Lansdowne said an employee earning £25,000 will face extra national insurance payments of £270 every year, while those earning £40,000 will see an increase of £481 . Currently final salary workers can opt . out of paying in to the state second pension and divert the money into . their more generous schemes. It also gives employers a tax break. But this will be taken away. Experts warned that the changes could spell the end of the 6,300 final salary schemes still in existence because employers face tax raises of up to 3.4 per cent. They face bills of an extra £657 for each employee earning £25,000, and £1,168 for those on £40,000. Those who are likely to benefit from the flat pension, which will be officially unveiled next week, are likely to be women who have taken time out from the workforce to care for children, part-time workers and those on low and middle incomes. The self-employed could also gain. But those on high or middle incomes, or with generous final salary packages, stand to lose. Tom McPhail, of Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ‘Employees are going to be upset because they’ll pay more, but many of them will end up doing better out of this. It will prompt another round of scheme closures.’ A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: ‘This is all part of simplifying the state pension system so that everyone paying in NICs knows exactly what they get in return.’","Flat-rate pension will result in higher national insurance for millions .

The birthplace of the human race is Asia - our earliest ancestors came to Asia in a huge migration 37-38 million years ago, before they evolved into present-day apes and humans. A team of palaeontologists in Myanmar has found the tooth of a pre-human ancestor - afrasia djijidae, so-called because it forms a missing link between Africa and Asia - that is very similar another early ancestor found in Libya. Four similar teeth were found after six years of sifting through sediment - a find that helps seal Asia as the starting point for our species. A team of palaeontologists in Myanmar has found the tooth of a pre-human ancestor - afrasia djijidae, so-called because it forms a missing link between Africa and Asia - that is very similar another early ancestor found in Libya . The 37-million-year-old tooth proves that early human ancestors lived in Asia, and only moved to Africa fairly late in the process of evolution - the latest in a series of discoveries that have 'sealed' Asia as the starting point for our species . The human family tree: A team of palaeontologists in Myanmar has found the tooth of a pre-human ancestor - afrasia djijidae, so-called because it forms a missing link between Africa and Asia. It is very similar another early ancestor found in Libya . ‘Not only does Afrasia help seal the case that anthropoids first evolved in Asia, it also tells us when our anthropoid ancestors first made their way to Africa, where they continued to evolve into apes and humans,’ says Chris Beard, Carnegie Museum of Natural History palaontologist. He worked with an international team that included scientists from the University of Poitiers. ‘Afrasia is a game-changer because for the first time it signals when our distant ancestors initially colonized Africa. If this ancient migration had never taken place, we wouldn’t be here talking about it.’ Paleontologists have been divided over exactly how and when early Asian anthropoids made their way from Asia to Africa. The trip could not have been easy, because a more extensive version of the modern Mediterranean Sea called the Tethys Sea separated Africa from Eurasia at that time. While the discovery of Afrasia does not solve the exact route early anthropoids followed in reaching Africa, it does suggest that the colonization event occurred relatively recently, only shortly before the first anthropoid fossils are found in the African fossil record. ¿Not only does Afrasia help seal the case that anthropoids first evolved in Asia, it also tells us when our anthropoid ancestors first made their way to Africa, where they continued to evolve into apes and humans,¿ says Chris Beard, Carnegie Museum of Natural History palaontologist . ¿Not only does Afrasia help seal the case that anthropoids first evolved in Asia, it also tells us when our anthropoid ancestors first made their way to Africa, where they continued to evolve into apes and humans,¿ says Chris Beard, Carnegie Museum of Natural History palaontologist . Myanmar’s 37-million-year-old Afrasia is remarkable in that its teeth closely resemble those of Afrotarsius libycus, a North African primate dating to about the same time. The four known teeth of Afrasia were recovered after six years of sifting through tons of sediment near Nyaungpinle in central Myanmar. Details of tooth shape in the Asian Afrasia and the North African Afrotarsius fossils indicate that these animals probably ate insects. The size of their teeth suggests that in life these animals weighed around 3.5 ounces, roughly the size of a modern tarsier. ‘For years we thought the African fossil record was simply bad,’ says Professor Jean-Jacques Jaeger of the University of Poitiers in France, the team leader and a Carnegie Museum research associate. ‘The fact that such similar anthropoids lived at the same time in Myanmar and Libya suggests that the gap in early African anthropoid evolution is actually real. Anthropoids didn’t arrive in Africa until right before we find their fossils in Libya.’ The search for the origin of early anthropoids—and, by extension, early human ancestors—is a focal point of modern paleoanthropology. The discovery of Afrasia shows that one lineage of early anthropoids colonized Africa around 37–38 million years ago, but the diversity of early anthropoids known from the Libyan site that produced Afrotarsius libycus hints that the true picture was more complicated. These other Libyan fossil anthropoids may be the descendants of one or more additional Asian colonists, because they don’t appear to be specially related to Afrasia and Afrotarsius. Fossil evidence of evolutionary divergence—when a species divides to create new lineages—is critical data for researchers in evolution. The groundbreaking discovery of the relationship between Asia’s Afrasia and North Africa’s Afrotarsius is an important benchmark for pinpointing the date at which Asian anthropoids colonized Africa.","Tooth from Myanmar is similar to tooth from Libya from 37 million years ago .

Kenji Ishida, a hobby robot . researcher from Kashiwa, in Japan's Chiba Prefecture, is the first to build and market a . remote-control car that is 'more than meets the eye'. The robot, which appears not to be endorsed in any way by Transformers' maker Hasbro, and is simply called Transform Robot Version 7.2, can convert from a cool looking 1/12 scale RC car into a robot hero in seconds. And that's not all, it also comes equipped with a rocket launcher in each arm, working lights, and a WiFi camera that allows users to follow its exploits. Controlled by what appears to be a modified Playstation joypad, it transforms from a car into a robot and back again in seconds. It is able to both walk on two legs and, just like any other RC car, drive on its four wheels. The WiFi camera transmits a view of the world as seen by the robot to any internet-connected device like a PC or tablet so that the owner can get a totally immersive experience. But this is just the start of the research. By 2030, Mr Ishida hopes to build his first full-size, fully working transforming robot that humans can ride. Prepare to strike: The robot is able to both walk on two legs and, when in car mode, drive on its four wheels . Plans: The Transform Robot Version 7.2 is the product of a decade of research by Mr Ishida's company Brave Robotics . The toy will be a dream come true for many men who grew up in the Eighties and early Nineties when the Transformers franchises offered what were among the coolest and most imaginative toys available. Beginning with the Transformers toy line, the franchise centres on factions of transforming alien robots - the Autobots and the Decepticons - in an endless struggle for dominance or eventual peace. In its decades-long history, the original Japanese idea has expanded to encompass comic books, animation, video games and films. It remains popular to this day.

But if you ordered today, you might just get lucky. Mr Ishida is said to be preparing to showcase his remarkable invention next week at Maker Faire Tokyo 2012. According to reports, the body of the latest robot and various other parts have been 3D printed, holding the promise that one day soon it could enter mass production.","Japanese robotics enthusiast offering a limited run of just 10 for sale .

Over two thirds of raw pork products sold in US supermarkets contain a dangerous bacteria that can lead to illness, a study has claimed. The report found that a large proportion of pork products harbour bacteria - but the prevalence of yersinia enterocolitica is the most striking finding. The food-borne pathogen was discovered in 69 per cent of all raw meat sampled in the study, carried out by Consumer Reports. Threat: A study, conducted by Consumer Reports, found that 69 per cent of the raw pork sampled contained the pathogen yersinia enterocolitica, which can lead to sickness . More well-known bacteria were significantly less prevalent in the study. Salmonella was found in only four per cent of products, while three per cent of meat samples tested positive for listeria. Eleven percent of samples, most of which were taken from popular supermarkets, contained the enterococcus bacteria and seven percent contained staphylococcus aureus bacteria. Yersinia enterocolitica affects more than 100,000 Americans every year, many of whom are children, and can induce fever, cramps and diarrhea. The bacteria though is relatively unheard of and for every diagnosis it is estimated that 120 cases go undetected. The study sampled a range of commonly consumed products, made up of 148 pork chops and 50 ground pork samples. The ground pork samples proved more likely to carry bacteria than the chop samples. Urvashi Rangan, who helped compile the report, described the results as 'concerning'. He told ABCNews: 'It’s hard to say that there was no . problem.  It shows that there needs to be better hygiene at animal . plants. Yersinia wasn’t even being monitored for.' The study sampled 148 pork chop and 50 ground pork products. It found a range of pathogens in the meat, including salmonella, listeria and enterococcus . He emphasised the importance of cooking raw meat properly to kill bacteria, adding: 'Anything that touches raw meat should go . into the dishwasher before touching anything else.' The study also found that many of the pathogens found were resistant to at least one form of antibiotic. Critics argue that the use of therapeutic antibiotics in livestock increases the levels of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the environment. The Pork Producer's Council however questioned the validity of the study given the sample size used. It said that the 198 samples did 'not provide a nationally informative estimate of the true prevalence of the cited bacteria on meat'. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said: 'USDA will remain vigilant against . emerging and evolving threats to the safety of America’s supply of meat, . poultry and processed egg products, and we will continue to work with . the industry to ensure companies are following food safety procedures in . addition to looking for new ways to strengthen the protection of public . health.'","Yersinia enterocolitica infects more than 100,000 Americans every year .

The body of Whitney, 21, was found in a remote wooded area on Friday, three days after she failed to turn up for her 7am shift just two minutes from her home in Gresham, Oregon. On Monday, medical examiner Dr Christopher Young revealed she died from multiple gunshot wounds, but declined to release further results from the autopsy. 'It's very difficult,' her husband, Clint Heichel, told Good Morning America. 'We only had a year and nine months together and when you get married you bet on forever. Broken: Clint Heichel has spoken for the first time since his wife was found killed after disappearing last week . 'She was very kind, she just loved everybody... She was just a beautiful little person and just full of love and a ray of love to everybody. 'She didn't do anything to deserve this. Why, is the only question. Why?' Mr Heichel had appeared at a family press conference on Thursday, but had been unable to speak through his sobs as he clutched relatives. In the GMA interview, he revealed that the man arrested on suspicion of the murder, 24-year-old Jonathan Holt, was married and lived with his wife in their apartment complex. Missed: Whitney Heichel is pictured with her husband. Her body was found on Friday in a wooded area . Heart-rending: Mr Heichel had been unable to speak through his sobs at a press conference on Thursday . The Heichels, who attended the same church as Holt, took care of his cats and plants while he was away and, two weeks ago, Mr Heichel even helped him jump start his motorbike, he said. Holt was arrested after Whitney's body was found on Larch Mountain, a remote forested area east of Gresham. Police collected DNA and fingerprints and carried out interviews. Police say they found . inconsistencies in the stories that Holt told investigators over the . course of two interviews. They added he is also tied to the crime by DNA evidence, but they would not elaborate. Authorities did not comment on whether they have a theory of what led to the killing. The Starbucks barista reportedly left . her apartment for work at about 6.45am on Tuesday on a drive that . typically takes less than five minutes. Accused: Jonathan Holt, 24, was arrested after inconsistencies in his stories to police. He is married and lives in the same apartment complex as the Heichels, who cared for his cats and plants . Search: A map of Gresham, Oregon shows the short distance between Heichel's home and her work . Her husband called police . roughly three hours later. He told investigators he tried to reach .

Two hours . later, her SUV was found in a Wal-Mart parking lot . with the passenger window smashed. A child later found her cell phone in . a field that lies between the gas station and the Wal-Mart, giving . investigators another venue to search. Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, Lorilei Ritmiller said her . daughter's nickname in the family is 'Mama,' as she was like a second mother to everybody, including her six siblings. Ritmiller . added that her daughter was a hard worker, a devoted Jehovah's Witness . with a 'heart as big as the sun,' and her greatest hope was to have . children of her own.

'She's . wanted to be a mama since she was two years old and I brought her . sister home,' she said. 'That was just her biggest hope, to have . babies.' Jim Vaughn, a family spokesman, spoke at a Friday night news conference and thanked police for their commitment in the case. 'Really, words can't begin to express the sadness that our families are experiencing tonight,' Vaughn said.

It continued: 'The outpouring of support from members of . our faith has been such an aid in helping us to deal with the pain and . loss of such a wonderful person. For us, this is not a surprise, because . this is “what we do” as an organization.' The statement also passed on the . gratitude of Whitney's mother and husband for the help they have . received from volunteers and authorities. Police received 25 phone tips on . Wednesday and another 21 that night. Two dozen detectives were assigned . to the case that had been classified as a suspicious disappearance. Friends . had said that a gas station attendant claimed that Heichel's vehicle, . which was found with the window smashed in, had been driven . by a man, who was acting 'suspicious and hurried', as Heichel sat in the . passenger seat. Abandoned: Her black 1999 Ford Explorer was found in a WalMart parking lot four miles from her home with a window smashed. It looked as if it had been rummaged through, friends said . Targeted: Police confirmed that her SUV was seen at a gas station before the vehicle was found in a car park . Her husband told Fox 12 that he learned of his wife's disappearance when her manager at Starbucks called to say she had not arrived for her shift. 'She got dressed this morning, normal everything.

Have you seen her or . talked to her?""' he told KATU. Mr Heichel tried calling and texting her, but she did not respond. Worried, he drove to her parents' home . and then to a hospital in the area, as well as calling family and . friends to see if anyone knew of her whereabouts. When they could provide no further . information, he called police to report her missing at 9.56am, and . friends and family began distributing flyers and searching for her. Workplace: Heichel's friends and colleagues gather on Saturday at the Starbucks where she worked . Remembered: It came just hours after her body was found on a remote mountainside .

This was the dramatic moment when a ship sank today after hitting another tug boat, prompting fears that 200 tonnes of diesel could leak and pollute the English Riviera's finest beaches. As the  decommissioned 260ft Moto Vessel Emsstrom went down off the coast of Devon this afternoon, engineers and seaman were onboard the Christos 22 and pumping water from it. Eight crew members were rescued after the Christos 22 - travelling from Germany to Turkey - was damaged by the vessel it was towing as it tried to anchor a mile off Hope's Nose in Torbay last night. Scroll down for video . Away it goes: This composite photo shows the Moto Vessel Emsstrom as it sank into the sea off Devon today . Danger: The Christos 22, pictured centre between two other tug boats, contains about 200 tonnes of diesel and is awaiting repairs before it can be towed to safety after taking on water off Hope's Nose, near Torbay, Devon . Sinking feeling: The Moto Vessel Emsstrom - which was being towed by the Christos 22 - lists in the sea after it damaged the tug boat in waters off Hope's Nose . Going down: The Moto Vessel Emsstrom eventually sank in the sea off Hope's Nose, near Torbay, Devon .

Spotlight: Eight crew members were rescued after the tug was damaged by a vessel it was towing . Location: The incident happened on Sunday night at around 8pm off Hope's Nose in Torbay, Devon . A Brixham Coastguard spokesman said: ‘The problem is this is happening quite close to shore and if this boat sinks there could be a big pollution problem. ‘There is a lot of diesel on the boat, and there's a good chance the diesel would leak if it sinks. It would contaminate the local beaches - all this part of the coast is a holiday coastline. ‘It is also a fishing area and would impact on the local birds and wildlife.’ He added that if the boat cannot be saved the Royal Navy ships will instead begin the ‘difficult’ task of pumping diesel out of the water. Two lifeboats have been at the scene with HMS Lancaster and the navy vessel HMS Severn and a second tug, the MTS Vulcan, is standing by.

The American government had elaborate plans set up for a ‘full nuclear response’ against China and the former Soviet Union in the height of the Cold War, it was revealed Wednesday. A previously unreleased top-secret document shows that there was a full line of emergency nuclear weapons to be used if the president was killed, went missing, or if America came under siege. The blitz was to be carried out, no questions asked, even if an attack was unintentional. However, President Lyndon B. Johnson changed the policy in October of 1968, as a means of reducing the insurmountable risks that came with full-blown nuclear warfare. Drastic measures: President Lyndon B. Johnson, pictured with key advisers, in the Situation Room in 1967; newly-released documents reveal their dramatic nuclear plan . Ready for action: Prior to 1968, the U.S. could have launched a no-questions-asked attack; here, a communications worker at the systems counsel of the Automatic Digital Network . The documents were released for the first time by the National Security Archive, and show the drastic measures the United States was willing to take in the event of attack. Advice: Johnson, who was president from 1963-1969, was told by advisers that 'Futherance' was highly dangerous . According to the once-classified documents, which were released from the National Security Archive of George Washington University, the pre-1968 U.S. had a simple plan if they were attacked – release a ‘full nuclear response.’ The document did not discriminate – the former U.S.S.R. and China were to be attacked instantaneously, regardless if an attack on their end was accidental or even their fault, according to The Nuclear Vault. That meant that if the Soviet Union attacked the U.S., they were mandated to retaliate against not only the U.S.S.R., but China as well, with a full nuclear strike. On October 14, 1968, Johnson and his cabinet discussed the idea of releasing nuclear weapons in the case that the president was killed or went missing, and was meant to be a last resort in preventing the breakdown of the chain of command, code-named ‘Futherance.’ The meeting took place during the last month of Johnson’s presidency, which the research institute notes is unusual, as it is unclear why LBJ waited so long to stop the dangerous operation. Walt Whitman Rostow, a political theorist in on the meeting, called a change in Futherance ‘essential.’ He said: ‘This was dangerous. We recommend going forward.’ General Earle Wheeler chimed in: ‘All the Joint Chiefs of Staff and commanders have been consulted. We recommend approval.’ For Presidential eyes only: The document, dated October 14, 1968, dramatically changed 'Futherance' Brave new world: A nuclear test explosion, 'Grable,' on 25 May 1953 in Nevada . The document, with an ‘Eyes Only for the President’ disclaimer, was released last month as part of a Mandatory Declassification Review appeal. They were released nine years after the initial request. President Obama in 2010 released his own nuclear strategy, saying that he was narrowing how the U.S. would use nuclear weapons. He said in a statement that ‘outliers like Iran and North Korea’ and other countries that have violated nuclear sanctions would be exceptions to U.S.-borne nuclear attack. The president also said: ‘We are going to want to make sure that we can continue to move towards less emphasis on nuclear weapons to make sure that our conventional weapons capability is an effective deterrent in all but the most extreme circumstances.’","Classified plan, code-named 'Futherance,' allowed U.S. to use nuclear weapons on U.S.S.R. and China, even if they weren't responsible for attack .

The rising Democrat star has revealed that he regularly sneaks out of his home for midnight manicures and pedicures. The 43-year-old politician told Du Jour magazine, a new luxury title, that he believes pedicures are 'transformative'. Manscaping: Newark mayor Cory Booker (above) has admitted that he sneaks out of his home to get midnight manicures and pedicures . Curiously, he claimed that he visited his local '24-hour mani-pedi place' in order to avoid being spotted by others, despite having spilled the beans to the publication. He explained: 'Being a public figure, people talk smack about you, so I... go in the middle of the night. I had an ex-girlfriend who ruined me in terms of my macho, ex-football-player self. She turned me onto mani-pedis.' Labeling the habit, which is more often associated with females, a 'guilty pleasure', he then said: 'Look, manis are good, but pedis - there's something... transformative'. Far more on topic, Mr Booker also spoke about his professional life, admitting that he was unsure what his long-term plans for his mayoral term involved. Common: More men are turning to the typically-female beauty rituals themselves . 'I would consider running for governor, absolutely,' he said. 'But I don't know if I would do that over staying where I am. 'Will I run for a higher office against a sitting governor or a senator of my own party? I do not know. I think the window closes very soon on some of those options, so either I proactively decide or it'll be a de facto decision.' It comes after news that the Democrat party has not offered Mr Booker a headline speaking role at the Democratic National Convention next month. He had called attacks on private equity 'nauseating' in unscripted remarks on May 20 about ads Barack Obama ran about Bain . Capital, the former company of presumptive GOP nominee Mitt Romney. 'Men don't want women to recoil in . horror when they see their toes' Mr Booker joins a growing number of men who are turning to the traditionally-female grooming habits in order to take care of themselves.

His family had been battling against a hospital trust's attempt to withdraw treatment, saying he still 'enjoyed life' A grandfather has died just ten days after his family lost a legal battle that allowed his hospital to withhold treatment if his condition deteriorated. David James, 68, walked into his local hospital last May with suspected constipation but never left after developing hospital acquired pneumonia and blood poisoning. Within weeks he was in intensive care and was left unable to speak or breathe unaided. Last summer the hospital trust - which cannot be named for legal reasons - launched a rare legal action seeking permission to withdraw potentially life-saving treatment from Mr James. His appalled family insisted Mr James, a professional musician, still enjoyed life and was not ready to die leading to a judge rejected the hospital trust's application . But the trust won an appeal against the decision days before Christmas meaning treatment could be withheld from Mr James if his condition deteriorated. His daughter Julie, 48, described the ruling as 'legalised murder'. Little more than a week later Mr James' condition deteriorated and he died in the early hours of New Year's Eve with his family saying they begged staff to do more to help. Julie said: 'When the nurse told us he was going I just got hold of him and held him tight. I told him we would keep on fighting for him. 'We are all in total shock. It's very hard to take in and my mum is distraught. 'Dad has bounced back so many times that it's hard to accept that it's not going to happen now. 'Even now I feel I should be getting ready to go to hospital to see him. It is hard to believe that this happened to a man who came into hospital for constipation a few months ago.' Mr James's condition deteriorated over the weekend and by Sunday his blood pressure was very low and his kidneys had started to fail. He was given medicine to tackle the low blood pressure but Julie says their calls for him to be given kidney dialysis were rejected. Julie says the hospital told her dialysis would be 'futile' and would have subjected her father to 'unnecessary distress'. Family fight: David's wife May with daughter Julie James refused to give up hope and fought for their husband and father not to be put on the care pathway . Before visiting hospital: David James pictured at home in Easter this year before he contracted pneumonia in hospital . Eventually Mr James went into cardiac . arrest on the morning of New Year's Eve and in accordance with the legal . judgement hospital staff did not give CPR. When Mr James's heart failed last August staff did give CPR and he made a good recovery. Mr James died with his wife of 50 years May, 76, Julie and son Paul, 37, at his bedside. Julie added: 'This is a direct . consequence of the court judgement ten days ago. I think they have . effectively been slowly withdrawing treatment ever since. 'As far as the family are concerned my . dad has been a victim of neglect from day one - and ever since the . court reversed his decision he was effectively sentenced to death. 'We are just all devastated that it happened so quickly.' Legal battle: May, right, Julie arriving at the High Court in Londonlast month ahead of the ruling which saw David put on the care pathway . The case of Mr James further illustrates the furore surrounding the Liverpool Care Pathway (LCP). Some relatives argue the controversial palliative care system is a way for medical staff to kill off the terminally ill and old. The courts accepted a claim by the . hospital that they were not invoking LCP in Mr James's case but his . family are adamant in their belief he was secretly placed in the . Pathway. Julie added: 'After the latest court hearing doctors told us they would negotiate with us when it came to on-going treatment. 'We didn't like that word - this is a human life we are talking about, not buying a new car. 'We knew it was futile too, because ultimately no-one can tell a doctor what to do and what not to do.' Happier times: David and May James on their wedding day in Liverpool in 1962 . Mr James had played guitar on the 1974 . hit who Do you Think you are by Candlewick Green and had also played . alongside the likes of Shirley Bassey and the Beatles. He was diagnosed with bowel cancer 11 . years ago and given just six months to live but made a full recovery . after chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery. He enjoyed good health until last May when he was admitted to his local hospital with suspected constipation. The hospital wanted to give him a CT scan which, as it was a Bank Holiday, could not take place for a few days. When his wife returned the following day she was told he had got hospital acquired pneumonia.

"By . Louise Boyle . PUBLISHED: . 01:14 EST, 29 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:33 EST, 29 June 2012 . Two female police officers, who allegedly leaked a photo of pop star Rihanna's bruised and battered face after she was assaulted by singer Chris Brown, will not face criminal charges, authorities said today. A three-year investigation by the LA district attorney's office could not find enough evidence to show celebrity news website TMZ paid the accused officers for the photo. Officers Blanca Lopez and Rebecca Reyes may still be fired. They are slated to appear before disciplinary panels in August. Pain: A photo of Rihanna's battered and bruised face after she was attacked by boyfriend Chris Brown was allegedly leaked to celebrity site TMZ by two LAPD officers . Brown, who was Rihanna's boyfriend at the time, was arrested on suspicion of beating the Grammy winner on February 8, 2009, leaving her battered and bruised. The singer, whose full name is Robyn Rihanna Fenty, canceled her Grammy performance that year after the incident. Brown pleaded guilty to attacking Rihanna and was ordered to serve five years on supervised probation and to complete six months of community service including roadside clean-up, graffiti removal and manual labor. Prosecutors alleged the picture was leaked after a stack of photographs of Rihanna's injuries was left lying on a desk at the Wilshire police station in Los Angeles and Reyes took a picture of the top photo with her phone. Volatile: Rihanna was dating singer Chris Brown when he attacked her in February 2009, sparking a national conversation about domestic violence . Prosecutors say Reyes later emailed the image from her LAPD email address to her personal account. Reyes and Lopez were roommates at the time, and phone records showed that they made multiple phone calls to Fox Television and TMZ in February. The photo shocked fans and prompted a national conversation about domestic violence after it spread through the media. But despite a search of Reyes' and Lopez's bank accounts, a money trail was not discovered tying the leak to them, prosecutors said. Leak: Pictures of Rihanna were taken at Wilshire police department in LA where it is believed they were sent to media outlets . In order to prove the officers broke the law, prosecutors said in the report they 'must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Reyes and Lopez disclosed the image of Robyn F. (Rihanna) to TMZ and obtained money in exchange for this disclosure'. The prosecutors' report noted that other LAPD personnel had access to the photos. 'As such, although both Reyes and Lopez's actions are suspicious, they are insufficient to support a criminal prosecution,' the report said. Rihanna's attorney Donald Etra said today he does not know at this time whether the singer wants to pursue any further legal action. 'Apparently this was an internal decision by the district attorney. A victim's privacy should be protected,' Etra said.","Officers Blanca Lopez and Rebecca Reyes may still lose their jobs .
