The case of a pregnant 11-year old girl who was raped in Chile by her mother's partner has set off a national debate about abortion in one of the most socially-conservative countries in Latin America. State TV reported that doctors say the girl, who is 14 weeks pregnant, is at high risk for her life and the life of her unborn child. However, she is unable to terminate her pregnancy because in Chille abortion is illegal under any circumstances. A national debate has begun in Chile where abortion is illegal after an 11-year-old got pregnant from rape. Seen here a Chilean pro-choice demonstrator protests against a court decision halting government distribution of free ""morning-after"" pills . Chile allowed abortions for medical reasons until they were outlawed in 1973 by General Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship. The current government of conservative President Sebastian Pinera has opposed any loosening of the prohibition. In the case of this young girl, who The Globe and Mail identify as 'Belen,' doctors say her life and the life of the fetus are at high risk. Abortion is illegal in Chile under the conservative government of President Sebastian Pinera (pictured here) However, due to the country's abortion laws ending the pregnancy is not an option. Many Chileans have vented their outrage over this case on social media. Some have started an online campaign to demand legalization of abortion in cases of rape or health risks for the mother. Chile's Senate rejected three bills last year that would have eased the absolute ban on abortions. Abortion has been illegal since 1973, under General Augusto Pinochet (pictured here) dictatorship. Spurred by this case, Chileans are now petitioning to legalize it in cases of rape or harm to mothers . One of the bills would have permitted abortion when two doctors said it was needed because of risks to a mother's life or other medical reasons, such as a fetus with low chances of survival. Another of the measures rejected would have allowed abortion in the event of rape.

A plastic surgeon has launched a brand of lingerie designed especially for women with mastectomies. So far, New York-based Dr Sharon T McLaughlin-Weber, who had reconstructive surgery herself after a lymphoma diagnosis at 13, has released two intimate sleepwear bras and one bikini top for Courage Couture. The items are designed to accommodate various weights of prosthetics, scarring and other issues associated with mastectomies. Bras for a cause: New York-based plastic surgeon Dr Sharon T. McLaughlin-Weber has launched Courage Couture, a lingerie brand for women who have had mastectomies or reconstructive surgery . 'I hope that one of my bikini designs . will be featured in Sports Illustrated and be worn by a model that has . had a mastectomy,' she told Fashionista, adding: 'She can be every bit as sexy as the next woman.' Earlier this year, a Change.org petition was launched petitioning Victoria's Secret to design a similar line of lingerie for women who have had mastectomies. Despite the petition amassing over 120,000 signatures, in the end the brand opted not to go through with the line, claiming that the creation of mastectomy bras is 'complicated and truly a science'. But Dr McLaughlin-Weber said that she . doesn't understand why Victoria's Secret opted out of the opportunity, . especially since it would have involved just a slight tweak to the . designs they already have. 'I don't think brands have a responsibility to help women with mastectomies, but I would think they'd want to' '[Victoria's Secret's] statement does not make any sense to me,' she said. 'They have the funding, facilities, designers and consultants to produce anything they want to produce.' She added that the brand's Pink lace bralette is 'three quarters of the way there' anyway. Courage Couture lingerie, which costs . $85 an item, is made from an elastic fabric which helps accommodate for . different weights of prosthetics. Inspiration: Dr McLaughlin-Weber has used her own expertise as a plastic surgeon, as well as her experience having had reconstructive surgery after a lymphoma diagnosis at the age of 13 . Special design: Courage Couture lingerie, which costs $85 an item, is made from an elastic fabric which helps accommodate for the different weights of prosthetics . The bras and bikini also feature an . adjustable bust, so that women with scars can choose how much or how . little cleavage they want to show. 'The line was designed to allow woman to reveal more if they wanted to,' says the Courage Couture website. 'A woman with a mastectomy can be every bit as sexy as the next woman' 'After all, our breasts may be altered but the rest of our body is the same as every other woman.' The bras are also aimed at women who have uneven breasts - either from birth or from surgery. While she is baffled by Victoria's Secret's decision not to launch a collection for women with mastectomies, Dr McLaughlin-Weber says she is happy to step in. 'I . do not think mass brands have a responsibility to help fill the needs . of women with mastectomies,' she said.

He said: ‘The allegation that I have . forced my religion on to other people, that I am some kind of religious . maniac, was made worse by the fact that they told me there was no need . to understand what this is all about.’ To Give And Not To Count The Cost: The prayer by St Ignatius Loyola, founder of the Jesuit order, sent by Dr Drew to his colleagues .

A bid by Edward Snowden for Icelandic citizenship failed as the country's parliament have voted not to debate it before the summer recess. The vote leaves Snowden - believed to be staying in a transit area at a Moscow airport - with one option fewer as he seeks a country to shelter him from U.S. espionage charges. Six members of parliament tabled a proposal to grant Snowden citizenship after they received a request from him via WikiLeaks, opposition parliamentarian Birgitta Jonsdottir said. Seeking asylum: Vladimir Putin has offered asylum to NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, pictured, who has been charged with espionage and theft . But a majority of parliamentarians voted late on Thursday against allowing the proposal to be put on the agenda, a day before parliament went into summer recess. It does not reconvene until September. 'Snowden has formally requested citizenship. But nothing is now going to happen. We could not even vote on it,' Jonsdottir told Reuters. In a letter dated July 4, posted on Jonsdottir's blog, Snowden wrote that he had been left 'de facto-stateless' by his government, which revoked his passport after he fled the country and leaked information about U.S. surveillance operations. Members of Iceland's Parliament house, the Althing, as it's known, will not debate the citizenship of Edward Snowden . Chess master Bobby Fischer was granted Icelandic citizenship after he got into trouble with the United States . He has sought asylum in a number of countries, but most, including Iceland, say he must be on their soil for his application to be accepted. His request for citizenship was a different tack, hoping that Iceland would give him a passport, as it has done in at least one similar case in the past. 'I appreciate that Iceland, a small but significant country in the world community, shows such courage and commitment to its higher laws and ideals' he wrote in the letter. Under Icelandic law, parliament can grant citizenship to foreigners, which can otherwise usually only be gained through naturalisation after a period of residence. Chess master Bobby Fischer was granted Icelandic citizenship by parliament after he got into trouble with the United States over tax evasion and breaking sanctions by playing a match in Yugoslavia in 1992. After years living abroad, he was detained in Japan, where he applied for and was awarded Icelandic citizenship in 2005. He spent his last years in Iceland before dying in 2008. Iceland's recently elected centre-right government is seen as far less willing to engage in an international dispute with the United States than the previous government, even if it will want to maintain the country's reputation for promoting Internet freedom. 'It is a disappointment that he is facing limited options,' WikiLeaks Icelandic spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson told Reuters. 'I am not optimistic that the new conservative government will take steps of courage and boldness to assist Mr Snowden.' Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa said earlier this week he had yet to . consider letting U.S. intelligence leaker Edward Snowden enter his . country but was said to be going cold on the idea . Russian president Vladimir Putin also offered Snowden Amnesty, on the condition that he would stop leaking confidential information about the United States. He said: 'If he [Snowden] wants to remain here . there is one condition - he should stop his work aimed at inflicting . damage on our American partners no matter how strange this may sound . coming from me.'

An heir to the Levi Strauss fortune promised his girlfriend he would give her $300,000 if she aborted his child - but then didn't pay her the money when she went through with it, she has claimed. Daniel S. Haas, a descendant of the Haas brothers, allegedly pressured Christina Helm, 45, into getting a termination because he was worried having a child out of wedlock would shame his family. He also feared what impact the baby would have on his life - and didn't want to stop taking extended ski-trips to Lake Tahoe or long surfing trips to South America, according to a complaint filed in Los Angeles Superior Court. At one point, he became so panicked about Helm keeping the baby that he smacked her across her bare stomach with her hand and demanded that she carry out the abortion, the complaint says. Claims: A woman has filed a complaint in Los Angeles Supreme Court, pictured, claiming that an heir to Levi Strauss jeans pressured her into an abortion and told her he would pay her if she did . Helm is seeking medical expenses, the money she was promised and punitive damages for fraud, breach of contract and intentional infliction of emotional . distress, Courthouse News Service reported. In her complaint, she says that she had been in a relationship with Haas for 13 months when she found out she was pregnant in June 2012. When she told him, he allegedly demanded she have an abortion, but she said she needed to take time to think about it as she was 45 and feared it could be her last chance to get pregnant. But the complaint claims that Haas was under the control of his family who pressured him to end the relationship and the pregnancy because upholding the family's image was of 'paramount importance'. 'Due to the family's wealth, the man never had to work,' the complaint says. 'Throughout time, the man became complacent and never stood up to the family. Family name: The complaint says he was worried about bringing shame on the family name by having a child out of wedlock. It adds that other family members pressured him into telling her to get an abortion . 'The man's complacency did not change . when his lover became pregnant out of wedlock. When the family demanded . that he ""fix"" the problem, he did. Even if ""fixing"" the problem meant . lying to his friend, lover and the mother of his unborn child.' He offered to pay her $300,000 if she underwent an abortion within the following week, and promised her she would have the money within 24 hours of having the procedure, the complaint says. Helm also claims that he threatened her with an endless custody battle if she did go through with the pregnancy and even said he would 'dislike' the baby because he or she would symbolize the end of his freedom. But when she went through with the . procedure in September 2012 and sent him paperwork to prove it, he did . not give her the money, she claimed. She added that she would not have gone through with the abortion if she knew he was lying. Family: He is a descendent of the Haas family; Peter Haas was president of Levi Strauss (seated) and former company president, his brother Walter (standing). They are next to cut-out of company founder . His 'true and only motivation was to ensure that [she] was no longer pregnant at all costs', according to the complaint, which claims that it was never his intention to go through with the promise. 'Haas had every incentive to end the relationship as quietly as he could as the public exposure was far too much for Haas to bear,' it says. Daniel Haas is a descendant of Walter and Peter Haas, brothers who joined their family business, Levi Strauss, in the 1940s and helped turn it into a successful, global company. MailOnline has approached Levi Strauss for a comment but neither the company nor its attorneys have responded.","Daniel Haas 'worried that a baby out of wedlock would bring shame on the family and didn't want a child to affect his long skiing and surfing trips'

David Cameron has given his backing to contentious plans to encourage the sale of expensive council houses. Local authorities have been urged to rid themselves of homes in high-value postcodes by the Prime Minister’s favourite think-tank, the Policy Exchange. Around £4.5billion a year could be raised if councils sold costly homes when tenants moved out. This could then be invested in extra housing stock in cheaper areas, the think-tank said. It could also be used to build new homes, stimulating the economy and generating jobs. Critics say the idea would create ghettos – but Downing Street gave the idea its firm backing yesterday. The Prime Minister’s official . spokesman said: ‘Councils should be looking at ways to use their social . housing stock as efficiently as they can. ‘The waiting lists for social housing . have increased a lot in the past. 'They doubled under the last . government. [Councils] need to think about how they can use that social . housing more efficiently. If they can sell very high-worth housing and . invest in more social housing and find homes for more people, that’s . something that should be looked at.’ Housing minister Grant Shapps has . also praised the proposal, saying: ‘Where you have houses which are . worth millions, you could sell them and build a lot more homes to help . sometimes vulnerable people come off the waiting list. Selling . off: Housing Minister Grant Shapps says that it is 'blindingly obvious' that council chiefs should sell off houses to generate money which . could build more homes . More jobs: Selling expensive homes in areas like Islington, North London, would mean more affordable housing could be built and that would create up to 340,000 jobs in the construction sector . A refugee family moved into a . Victorian end-of-terrace home worth £1.25million in Fulham after it was given a £76,000 facelift - and then trashed it. Jobless Manal Mahmoud . received thousands of pounds in housing benefit from Hammersmith and Fulham Council, but her seven wayward children refused to co-operate and have been accused of anti-social behaviour. After pressure from the council she has agreed to leave the borough and signed a court order promising her children would clean up their act. The agreement means the clan will be given a new taxpayer-funded property after the council acknowledged it had a ‘legal obligation’ to find them a new home. ‘It is blindingly obvious, and only a . perverse kind of left-wing dogma that appears indifferent to those . languishing on record waiting lists prevents this kind of common sense . from prevailing.’ There has been outrage at revelations . that taxpayers have been footing costly rent bills for social tenants, . including £2,875 a week for an Afghan family living in a seven-bedroom . house in Acton, West London. The Policy Exchange’s report, Ending . Expensive Social Tenancies, said selling council homes in such areas . would be enough to build 80,000 to 170,000 more properties. Neil O’Brien, the think-tank’s . director, said social housing would still exist in very expensive areas . under its proposal, but there would be ‘less of it’. Under the new . system, he told the BBC, ‘rather than having one lucky family with a . very expensive house you would have two families, perhaps desperately . waiting for social housing, now having a roof over their heads’. The waiting list for social housing could be reduced by about 500,000 to around 1.3million if the sales went ahead, he added. However, Councillor Mike Jones, . chairman of the Local Government Association’s housing board, said: . ‘These are decisions that should be taken at a local level by councils . who best know the value of their housing stock and the extent and type . of housing needed in their area.’ Mother of eight Francesca Walker was placed in a £2.6m house in Notting Hill, west London at the taxpayers' expense . A single mother with three children was placed by her local council in a £1.5m mews house, left, in Kensington, west London, four years ago. Right, the seven-bedroom home in Acton, West London, where an Afghan family were placed at a cost of £2,875 a week to taxpayers . Labour said new homes were urgently . needed, but stressed that ‘driving out hard-working families on low . wages from whole neighbourhoods’ was not the answer. The National Housing Federation . warned many towns would be ‘cleansed’ of ‘hard-working people who can’t . afford to pay high prices’. Around one in five of the country’s . 3.8million council houses are worth more than the average home, with . some worth over £1million. Selling the 816,000 ‘costly’ council houses . would raise about £159billion. About 3.5 per cent of the total stock . is vacated each year, as tenants move or die. If the Government sold . off this proportion of the costly homes – about 28,500 a year – it could . raise £4.5billion. £2million: A townhouse owned by Islington Council in London . This £2million Georgian townhouse in Islington, North London, is among the pricy properties that councils could be forced to sell off if the Policy Exchange’s proposals are pushed through. The property underwent a £100,000 renovation last year, which created two more bedrooms for a total of six. It is currently occupied by a Somali family of ten, who use housing benefits from Islington Council to pay a heavily discounted rent bill. Another candidate for sale is a £1million council house in private mews in Chelsea, which was recently boarded up after its tenants were evicted. Neighbours called for the four-bedroom property, which was empty for a year, to be sold and the profit used to help families who are desperate for a home. It is still owned by Kensington and Chelsea Borough Council, but is no longer vacant. For one council, the sell-off has already started. A vacant period mid-terrace house in Fulham went for £721,000 last month, while a three-bedroom flat was sold for £700,000. A nearby property was sold for £705,000 in June. Gone: House in Fulham worth £705,000 . Sold: House in Fulham worth £700,000 . Gone: House in Fulham worth £721,000 . Dame Shirley Porter was at the heart of the Conservative Party during Baroness Thatcher's reign and rose to great heights as the leader of Westminster Council. She played a key role in a 1980s scandal that saw council homes sold off to potential Tory voters in marginal wards in a bid to boost Conservative election prospects. In July 1987, Westminster Council's housing committee voted to sell 500 council homes a year to designated tenants in a policy called 'building stable communities.' Conservative council leader, Shirley Porter, was determined to improve her party's standing at the 1990 local elections as the previous year, the Conservative majority in the council had been reduced from 26 to four. Between 1987 and 1989 Dame Shirley focused the housing policy on eight marginal wards in the borough. At a fraction of their market value, properties were only offered for sale to tenants likely to vote Conservatives. In theory owner-occupiers were viewed as more likely to vote Conservative and homes were left vacant to encourage their purchase. In turn homeless families were discouraged from moving into the ring-fenced properties and Labour tenants were moved out into less critical areas. After the scandal broke, an investigation was launched - the policy was judged illegal by the district auditor, and after years of wrangling Dame Shirley was made to repay Westminster Council £12.3 million.","Local authorities have been urged to sell costly homes when tenants move out .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 11:13 EST, 5 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:53 EST, 5 July 2013 . A journalist has lost the libel lawsuit she filed against a rival station after they aired footage of her in a bikini at a pool party at the home of a man who is a person of interest in the case of his wife's disappearance. Amy Jacobson was an on-air reporter for Chicago's NBC affiliate when the local CBS station aired footage of her lounging at a July 6, 2007 pool party at the home of Craig Stebic. Craig's wife Lisa disappeared in April 2007 and he refused to speak to police for much of the investigation. The video: Stills show Amy Jacobson in her bikini at Craig Stebic's house that prompted the lawsuit . Caught on camera: Amy Jacobson worked for NBC when she was seen at the house of a man who was suspected of having something to do with his wife's disappearance months earlier . Just days after the pool party, CBS aired the footage of Jacobson and her children at the Stebic's pool; on July 12 Craig was formally named as a person of interest in the case. Jacobson was fired after the footage aired, and she filed a libel lawsuit against CBS as well as Stebic's neighbor who filmed the video from their property. In February 2009, a Cook County judge ruled that he would allow four counts of defamation to be considered by the courts, saying that 'the CBS newscaster presented  the footage with statement made in the form of insinuations and questions regarding Jacobson activities while at the Stebic home'. 'These statements...suggest that Jacobson used improper methods in cultivating sources and obtaining stories,' Judge Elizabeth Budzinski wrote in her ruling. Fighting back: Jacobson was then fired by NBC when CBS aired footage of her at 'person of interest' Craig Stebic's house and she has sued CBS for defamation, but that was just tossed out of court . Conflict: Craig Stebic's wife Lisa disappeared in April 2007, months before Lisa Jacobson was seen at his pool and a year before Jacobson's husband filed for divorce . The Chicago Tribune reports today that a different Illinois judge threw out the lawsuit, saying that some of the parts of the CBS report that Jacobson took issue with are 'constitutionally protected expressions of opinion'. Judge Jeffrey Lawrence went on to write the Jacobson and her lawyer did not provide enough evidence to prove that the content was fabricated. This does not seem like the end of the legal drama, however, as Jacobson seems intent on an appeal. 'We'd always figured there would be an appeal before this went to trial because there are too many issues,' Jacobson's lawyer Kathleen Zellner told The Tribune. Since her firing, Jacobson has begun working as a radio journalist and was promoted to co-host for a local station in 2010. Lisa Stebic is still missing and her case has not progressed since Craig was named as a person of interest. Determined: Jacobson got a call from Stebic's sister who invited them over for a meeting to talk about the case and they went for a swim with their children . Stebic's body has never been found, and her relatives- as well as her two children- presume that she is dead. She and Craig were in the middle of getting divorced when she didn't show up to pick up her then-10 and 12-year-old children at their school. Troubled: Prior to her disappearance, Lisa Stebic told friends that if anything should happen to her, look at Craig . After her disappearance, friends and neighbors told of how Lisa had inquired about a domestic violence shelter, and said to one: 'If anything ever happened to me, look towards Craig'. Jacobson was one of the two reporters who got access to Stebic in the days immediately following Lisa's disappearance, and he initially claimed his innocence. Police eventually raided his house in the middle of the night shortly after and found 24 guns. According to Chicago magazine, a media relations consultant that was helping Lisa Stebic's family during the investigation told Stebic's neighbors to have fully charged video cameras aimed at his house at all times in case they spot anything suspicious. On July 6, Jacobson was driving to the local swim club with her two sons when she got a call from Craig's sister Jill Webb who was visiting from Iowa with her family to support her brother. She told the reporter that she was upset about some of the other network coverage of the case, and asked if she would like to talk about the case with them at Stebic's home. Jacobson agreed after Webb said it would be fine for her to bring her two children with her to the home. At one point during the interview, Jacobson, Webb, and their five collective children all jumped in the pool. She said that she and Stebic were never in the pool at the same time, and looking back she called the decision to go to a source's house in a bathing suit 'a horrible mistake' but maintains that there was nothing improper going on between she and the missing woman's husband.","Lisa Jacobson was an NBC reporter in Chicago who was covering the disappearance of mother-of-two Lisa Stebic in the spring of 2007 .

A gay man claims he’s been labelled a 'serious criminal' by police because of a relationship he had in the army 30 years ago. Officers threatened 50-year-old Stephen Close with arrest unless he provided a DNA sample as part of a controversial crime crackdown . Mr Close was sentenced to six months in prison in 1983 after he admitted having sex with a male colleague while serving with the Royal Fusiliers in Berlin. Although homosexuality was decriminalised in 1967 it remained an offence in the armed forces until 1994 and the ban on homosexuals serving in the British Military was not lifted until 2000. Mr Close, from Salford, was discharged from the army after being charged with gross indecency and he was later convicted of sexual assault in a military court as both he and his partner were under 21, the legal age of consent for gay sex at the time. He said he was stunned when police arrived at his home last Sunday and demanded he provide a DNA sample. He said: 'If you look at the details of my criminal record, I can’t see what possible threat I’m meant to pose to the public and why I’ve been targeted by police.I find it completely ridiculous.' Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said they were 'concerned about the particular issues' Mr Close’s case had raised. The force launched Operation Harvest last year in a bid to collect DNA samples from 2,000 people convicted of serious crimes. The operation, using controversial new . powers under the Crime and Security Act 2010, saw samples added to a DNA . database in a bid to match suspects to unsolved crimes. Cap badge of the Royal Fusiliers . If ex-offenders refuse to provide a sample, officers have the power under the act to force them to comply. The . act Mr Close was convicted for is no longer illegal as the age of . homosexual sex was lowered to 18 in 1994 and then 16 in 2001. He told the Manchester Evening News: 'If I did the same thing today, it would not longer be considered illegal. Yet the police still want my DNA on record and to me it just begs the question ‘why?’” GMP’s deputy chief constable Ian Hopkins said that DNA samples from convicted offences allowed the force to 'look for potential matches with DNA evidence recovered from previously unsolved crimes.' But he added: 'We do understand the very personal and sensitive issues that Mr Close has raised. 'We are concerned about the particular issues his case raises and therefore we would invite him to make direct contact with Greater Manchester Police so we can review his case.'","'I can't see what possible threat I pose and why I've been targeted'

Four devout Christians will this week ask human rights judges to uphold complaints that the UK government failed to respect their right to religious freedom. In a landmark case on Tuesday they will argue they have suffered discrimination as a result of their faith and appeal against their treatment. The four - former nurse Shirley Chaplin, relationship counsellor Gary McFarlane, British Airways worker Nadia Eweida and registrar Lilian Ladele - will go to the European Court of Human Rights  in Strasbourg. Faith: The cross is a symbol of faith for Christians, but employers can ban them at work, according to the Government . Mrs Chaplin, from Devon, left her job after 30 years in the NHS when she was told she could not wear her crucifix because of health and safety rules. Mr McFarlane was sacked for saying he might not feel comfortable giving sex therapy to homosexual couples. Miss Eweida was prevented from wearing a cross and Ms Ladele was disciplined by London's Islington Council for refusing to conduct civil partnership ceremonies. The Government will argue Christians do not have the right to wear a crucifix at work and that employers can ban them and sack workers who insist on doing so. Discrimination case: Shirley Chaplin was asked to remove her crucifix, right,  after being stopped on her ward . Leading church figures are backing the case against the Coalition with the former Bishop of Rochester, the Rt Rev Michael Nazir Ali submitting an 11-page document to the court. Sacked: Relate counsellor Gary McFarlane became a Christian at 17 . He claims that the right of Christians have been 'vanquished' amid an 'increasingly aggressive secularism' while courts have allowed the wearing of a Sikh bangle, the Islamic headscarf and even a cornrow haircut. Lord Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury has claimed Christians are being 'persecuted' by the courts and 'driven underground.' Mrs Chaplin, a 56-year-old grandmother from Kenn, near Exeter, was taken off hospital wards and moved to a desk job after refusing to remove the religious symbol she had worn since she was 16. After losing her religious discrimination case against the hospital trust that employed her at the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital as a sister, she described the result as 'a very bad day for Christianity'. She added: 'I have worn my cross for 38 years and it has never harmed . anybody. If I am forced to hide it, I feel I am denying my Christian . convictions.' Today Mrs Chaplin is not looking forward to appearing in front of judges to argue her case. She told the Sunday Telegraph: 'I'm not out to start a revolution. 'I'm a very ordinary person with faith - and I think that faith is being undermined in this country. In Britain there is a lot of talk about cultural diversity, tolerance of faiths and the importance of embracing the whole community yet that doesn't seem to extend to Christians.' Mrs Chaplin is being supported by the Christian Legal Centre, who are also backing Gary McFarlane. They have instructed Paul Diamond, a leading human rights lawyer, to represent them in Strasbourg. Mr McFarlane, 51, a father of two who arrived in Britain from Jamaica when he was six, became a Christian at 17 and joined Relate as a relationship counsellor in 2003. Christians: Registrar Lilian Ladele who was disciplined and Nadine Eweida  whose cross was banned . But in 2007 his non-attendance at a training lecture for couples counselling which screened the film Brokeback Mountain about two cowboys who fall in love, was reported to his manager in the Avon branch. Later that year he was suspended when he responded to his manager that he didn't 'really know' what felt about providing sex therapy for same-sex couples. He said: 'That was my honest answer - I really hadn't  thought about it. - it had never come up as an issue. 'Why would a gay couple come to me why would they not choose a gay sex therapist when there are plenty?' Mr McFarlane was unable to complete his qualification as a sex therapist and refused memberships of representative bodies which would have given him access to clients. He told the paper: 'I understand diversity and I know what it is to be a minority.'","'I have worn my cross for 38 years and never harmed anybody'

Scroll down for video . Gone: Gilbert Thomas Collar, right, with his mother Bonnie Smith Collar - the 18-year-old student was shot dead while naked and physically threatening a University of South Alabama police officer on Saturday . Slightly built freshman: Collar was not exactly an imposing presence standing 5ft 7inches tall and weighing 135 pounds . 'Whatever caused the incident was something that made him act not in his normal personality,' she said. School officials with access to the security video footage have said nothing to indicate that Collar was armed. And they have refused to say whether the officer who shot Collar was carrying a baton and pepper spray, both of which campus officers typically have with them. An attorney for the family, former Alabama Lt. Gov. Jere Beasley, said his firm's review of the shooting would include whether the officer followed department rules and regulations. The university said the officer heard a bang on a window at campus police headquarters and went outside to investigate. The officer tried to retreat numerous times to defuse the situation before opening fire, the university said in a news release. The case has been handed over to . Mobile County authorities and could take weeks to resolve. Meanwhile, . friends and relatives are trying to figure out what could have happened . to the quiet kid who showed so much promise. Collar grew up in the rural outskirts of Wetumpka, about 20 miles north of Montgomery. Brandon Ross, a sophomore at Jacksonville State University, said Collar moved to the neighborhood as an eight-year-old. 'I was the first person he met on the bus, and we've been friends ever since,' he said. 'He was the kid everybody liked.' 'It's completely opposite of the way . he was,' said South Alabama student Chandler Wescovich of Long Beach, . Miss., who became friends with Collar during his short time on campus. Others agreed the actions were out of character for the normally quiet and reserved Collar, whom friends described as a popular and good-looking high school wrestler who stood 5-foot-7 and 135 pounds. Collar wasn't someone to make enemies and even befriended his wrestling opponents, said his high school wrestling coach, Jeff Glass. Collar wasn't known as a troublemaker and had only two minor scrapes with the law, according to court records: a speeding ticket and a citation for being a minor in possession of three cigarettes in March. He paid a $25 fine for the tobacco possession. He was also so good-looking that his teammates didn't like standing next to him in team photos. 'The girls thought he was the best thing they had ever seen, and they may have been right,' Glass said. Family: Collar is pictured with his older sister Doris Elisabeth Collar in this undated family photo . Grown Up: Collar's family is struggling to understand the events that lead to his death. He is pictured with his older sister in an undated family photo . At . 1:23 a.m. on Saturday, Oct. 6, University of South Alabama Police . responded to a loud banging noise on the west side window of the police . station. When an officer exited the station to investigate, he was . confronted by a muscular, nude man who was acting erratically. The man . repeatedly rushed and verbally challenged the officer in a fighting . stance. The officer . with weapon drawn ordered the individual to halt. The officer retreated . numerous times in an attempt to calm the situation. The individual . continued to press toward the officer in a threatening manner. The . assailant kneeled for a moment, and then he rose again, rushing and . chasing the officer, who continued to retreat away from the building. When the individual continued to rush toward the officer in a . threatening manner and ignored the officer's repeated commands to stop, . the officer fired one shot with his police sidearm, which struck the . chest of the assailant. The individual fell to the ground, but he got up . once more and continued to challenge the officer further before . collapsing and expiring. The deceased has been identified as Gilbert Thomas Collar, an 18-year-old freshman from Wetumpka, Ala. Immediately . after the incident, the USA Police Department contacted the District . Attorney's Office to request an external investigation. Mobile County . Sheriff's Department will assist. The officer has been placed on paid . administrative leave pending the outcome of internal and external . reviews. The University extends its condolences to Mr. Collar's family. Wescovich said everything seemed normal when he saw Collar with friends in a student dining hall less than six hours before the shooting. Wescovich said he and others gave Collar a ticket to BayFest, an outdoor music festival in Mobile, and went on their separate way. Hours later on campus, Collar was out of sorts and appeared intoxicated from alcohol or something else, according to two acquaintances who saw him. He was screaming profanities in the street and running around naked, said South Alabama student Bronte Harber, 18, of Columbus, Ohio. Sarah Hay, 18, of Dallas, said she saw Collar shirtless outside her on-campus residence shortly before Harber encountered him. Collar was the loudest of a group of four or five young men, she said, and some of the others were trying to get him to calm down.

On the Facebook page for the Vanguard, the school's student newspaper, Collar's friends and classmates similarly expressed shock and confusion that the officer felt the need to use deadly force on a young man they described as 'sweet' and 'easy going.'

For 25 years, Roy Thomson thought he had accidentally killed a fellow oil-rigger on Piper Alpha when he ran through thick black smoke and leapt from the blazing rig. Unable to see, and his boots melting, Mr Thomson charged into another man at the edge of the rig's platform, shoving him over the side. Together they tumbled and plummeted 120ft into the North Sea. While he doesn't remember hitting the water, he recalls the fall felt like a long time; he then remembers the struggle and 'panic' to get back to the surface.

An essay by Jon Pareles in the New York Times Friday detailed the odious process of downloading Jay-Z's 'Magna Carta Holy Grail' album on a Samsung phone, and all of the privacy settings listeners would have to give up in order to listen to it. Samsung bought one million copies of Jay-Z's latest album to release to certain Samsung device owners three days before the actual release. In . order to receive the first downloads, all you needed to do was download . the Android App 'JAY Z Magna Carta' from the Google app store. But then a pop-up lists all of the app permissions you must accept in order to listen to the album. By downloading the app you agree to . let it modify or delete items in the storage on your phone and access . your location on GPS. It also gathers information on the email addresses . and social media accounts associated with your phone. The . app requires Facebook and Twitter logins because, as one Jay-Z . spokesman said, 'We would like fans to share the content through social . networking sites.'

But the state-of-the-art Routemaster buses have left passengers fuming after a faulty air conditioning caused temperatures on board to soar. Heat levels on some of the buses were found to have exceeded the maximum allowed for transporting farm animals across Europe. Scroll down for video . Scorching: Temperatures on the top deck of the bus exceeded 30C - surpassing the maximum allowed for transporting farm animals across Europe (File photo) Upper-deck heat levels were recorded at more than 30C, according to an Evening Standard investigation. The problem on the new double-deckers, christened 'Boris Buses' after the London mayor who introduced them at a cost of £354,500 each, is caused by air-conditioning faults and the absence of opening windows. Transport for London today admitted the buses had 'teething problems' and encouraged concerned passengers to complain. The problem led to the buses being branded 'cauldrons on wheels' after windows were omitted by their designer Thomas Heatherwick — best known for his Olympic cauldron. He feared that they would 'ruin the efficiency' of the on-board cooling units. Temperatures recorded at 1pm yesterday on the upper deck of a No 24 bus reached 30.4C, more than 7C hotter than outside. Humidity hit 77 per cent — almost double that on the Tube and 15 points higher than Asian countries such as Malaysia. Unveiling: A proud London Mayor Boris Johnson poses next to one of the new Routemaster buses which are being rolled out across the capital . Last month route 24, between Pimlico and Hampstead Heath, became the first run entirely with the new buses. TfL is to roll out 600 of the buses, built by Wrightbus in Northern Ireland, by 2016 at a cost of £212 million. Route 11, which runs between Liverpool Street station and Fulham Broadway, will convert on September 21. The buses, described by the Mayor as 'a brilliant feat of British engineering', were first trialled on route 38 — where several continue to operate alongside conventional double-deckers — 18 months ago. Mike Weston, operations director for London Buses, told the London Evening Standard: 'We are aware of some technical issues with the ventilation and air chill system on some of the New Bus for London vehicles on Route 24. Our suppliers are working to fix the issue as soon as possible. 'Sauna on wheels': The new Routemaster bus has been slammed for leaving passengers sweltering in the heat . Problem: Designer Thomas Heatherwick feared windows would ruin the efficiency of the air conditioning units on the new Routemasters . As you would expect with the introduction of a large fleet of new buses, there will be teething problems and we are working hard to minimise the impact of these on our customers.' Passengers went on Twitter to express their fury. One described the conditions as 'hotter than magma'. Another dubbed the buses 'moving saunas'. Others called on TfL to hand out water to passengers. The problem was revealed as TfL published its 'beat the heat' plan for summer — and as forecasters warned that London was set to experience the hottest day of the year on Sunday, with a 27C peak. Replaced: The much-loved older Routemaster bus, pictured, was phased out in 2005 in favour of newer, more efficient, models . Nursery nurse Lucyanna Hiscock, 25, from Pimlico, said: 'Everyone I know hates the buses. 'They look nice but there are no windows and the air conditioning doesn't work. 'And at night they close the back doors so you're completely shut in. It was so hot the other day I thought I was going to faint.' TfL said: 'We ask any passenger who feels our service falls below what they expect — for example the bus air cooling system not working — to contact us.

An ambulance was sent 83 miles to help a critically-ill pensioner - even though he lived barely a mile from a hospital. Barry Edwards, 79, from Cambridge, had dialled 999 after suffering severe stomach pains. He had suffered an aortic aneurysm - a dangerous condition which occurs when a blood vessel in the stomach swells. But the call was not treated as urgent and it took two more 999 calls and visits from a doctor and a paramedic before an ambulance finally arrived almost two and a half hours later, the Cambridge News reported. Critical: Mr Edwards waited for more than two hours for an ambulance despite complaining of severe stomach pains . It had been dispatched from Great Yarmouth in Norfolk, a distance of almost 83 miles and at least an hour and a half drive, despite the fact that Mr Edwards lived only a few streets away from Addenbrooke's Hospital where he was eventually treated. He died the following morning. East of England Ambulance Trust (EEAT) said an investigation is underway to establish what happened. The Trust has come in for major criticism recently after a damaging report about its performance. The service, which covers Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Norfolk and Suffolk, was criticised for almost two years over its poor response times, particularly in rural areas, before it was reviewed. The long way round: An ambulance was eventually sent on an 83 mile journey from Great Yarmouth to Mr Edwards' house on Ashbury Close in Cambridge . MP Anthony Marsh, who carried out the review, said managers had developed a 'sense of helplessness' which had led to the failings. All five non-executive directors of the Trust have since resigned in the wake of the scandal. Mr Edwards' sister Madelaine described the agonising last few hours before the ambulance finally arrived on December 5 last year. She told the Cambridge News:  'I knew my brother was going to die. The last few hours of his life were horrific. He deserved so much better than that.' Mrs Edwards has called for 999 operators to be better trained so that emergency calls are properly assessed. Her local MP Julian Huppert has written to the Trust asking for a full investigation into the case. Investigation: MP Julian Huppert described Mr Edwards' treatment as 'appalling' and said lessons must be learned . The Trust told him that a review had been carried out, but as Mrs Edwards was not happy with the conclusions, a fresh investigation is underway. Mr Huppert described the treatment of Mr Edwards as 'appalling'. He said a full review is necessary so that lessons are learned. A spokesman for the EEAT told Cambridge News: 'The MP Julian Huppert made an official complaint in December and the concerns were investigated and EEAST sent their findings to Julian Huppert. 'Following this, he wasn’t happy with the outcome so the investigation has been reopened by EEAST and this is an on-going process. 'Once the follow up investigation is resolved, Julian will receive the updates as a matter of priority.'","Barry Edwards dialled 999 after suffering severe stomach pains .

Scroll down for video . Hearing: Vicky Pryce (left) and her the ex-husband, Britain's former energy secretary Chris Huhne (right), will be sentenced together on Monday afternoon - and probably face jail . Pryce was found guilty by a jury . yesterday of perverting the course of justice by taking speeding points . for Huhne in 2003. The former energy secretary had already pleaded . guilty to the same charge. It carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, although the average sentence is around 10 months. Both 58-year-old Huhne and economist Pryce, 60, have been warned to be under no illusion about what punishment they face. Pryce took a 10-month sabbatical on full pay to clear her name, but she resigned as a senior managing director at FTI Consulting yesterday. Quit: Vicky Pryce has been forced to quit her role as Senior Managing Director at FTI Consulting after her conviction yesterday . Success: Pryce, pictured in 2002, had built a successful media career as an economic pundit but now faces jail . Hiding: Chris Huhne covered his face from photographers using his umbrella today while Carina Trimingham, the woman he left Vicky Pryce for, dashed also into their Central London home in the rain . The role had allowed her to earn huge sums as pundit on TV, radio and in newspapers, giving her views on the recession and the crisis in her native Greece. A spokesman for FTI Consulting told MailOnline: ‘We can confirm Vicky Pryce resigned yesterday after the verdict. ‘She was on a full-pay sabbatical since May 2012 until her resignation’. Their spokesman refused to reveal her salary, but it is believed to be in excess of £100,000 a year. Page: Pryce's dedicated page on the FTI Consulting website has not yet been removed after her resignation . Pryce was born Vasiliki Courmouzis in Athens, and studied at the London School of Economics. After picking up an MSc in monetary economics, she became an economist at Williams and Glyn's bank, then at Esso Europe. In 1986 she was appointed chief economist at KPMG, where she became a partner and stayed until 2001. She later became chief economic adviser at the Department of Trade and Industry, now known as the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, earning £110,000 a year. Affair: Huhne left Pryce for his aide Carina Trimingham, right, who accompanied him to court when he changed his plea to guilty . Trapped: Huhne's BMW is pictured speeding as he returned home from Stansted Airport in 2003 . Her world fell apart yesterday when a jury unanimously found her guilty. Pryce’s had plotted to ‘nail’ the former minister after he dumped her for his bisexual political aide and claimed that he bullied her into taking his speeding points. The disgraced pair will stand side by side when they return to court to face jail, probably within two weeks. In a final twist, 60-year-old Pryce could end up with the longer prison term. Facing jail: Vicky Pryce swept away from court without saying a word having been found guilty of perverting the course of justice . Legal experts anticipate that the couple will be sentenced to at least six months, but that Huhne will be given a small discount for his guilty plea while Pryce dragged her family through two trials. The multi-lingual professor, made a Companion of the Order of Bath by the Queen, must brace herself for a prison sentence among petty thieves, drug addicts and fraudsters. Huhne has already stepped into political oblivion after admitting his crime and resigning from his Eastleigh seat, triggering last week’s by-election. Driven by jealously and anger, Pryce . sparked the police investigation by leaking his illegal actions eight . years earlier to the Press. But . by pointing the finger at her ex-husband she also incriminated herself . and ended up trying to escape justice with the unusual defence of . marital coercion. Ultimately . the jury was left with the stark choice of whether to believe her as . she raked over the ashes of her 26-year marriage without fear of . contradiction from Huhne. Outside court an emotional Pryce stood . alongside her solicitor, who spoke on her behalf and said she was 'very . disappointed to have been convicted' and thanked her friends, family and . colleagues for their support. On the first day of . their trial on February 4 Huhne caused gasps of disbelief after he . finally admitted the crime after years of telling ‘anyone who would . listen’ - including the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister - . that he was innocent. Pryce said she had taken the points for her former husband but she denied the charge, claiming he forced her to do it. The case dates back to 2003 . when Huhne was caught speeding in his BMW near Stansted Airport. He thought he would lose his licence, . jeopardising his chances of being nominated as the Lib Dem candidate for . Eastleigh, Hampshire. Guilty: Vicky Pryce in the dock at Southwark Crown Court as she was told she had perverted the course of justice . Pryce admitted taking the blame for him but claimed he forced her to take the . points, using 'marital coercion' as a defence. He went on to win the seat, despite . an eventual driving ban later that year after he was caught talking on . his mobile phone while driving. She said he put his political career first throughout their . 26-year marriage, while she was forced to compromise her own successful . career. But the jury . unanimously failed to accept her version of events as the prosecution . convinced them she was not the 'quivering jelly' she claimed.","Disgraced economist quits as senior managing director at FTI Consulting .

Locked up: Kenneth Bae, who has been sentenced to 15 years of 'compulsory labour' by North Korea for unspecified crimes against the state . An American has been sentenced to 15 years hard labour in North Korea after the hardline Communist regime accused him of trying to overthrow the state. Kenneth Bae, a Washington state man . described by friends as a devout Christian and a tour operator, is at . least the sixth American detained in North Korea since 2009.

'North Korea is using Bae as bait to . make such a visit happen. An American bigwig visiting Pyongyang would . also burnish Kim Jong Un's leadership profile,' added Mr Ahn. Kim took power after his father, Kim Jong Il, died in December 2011. He is believed to be just 29 years old. North Korea has faced increasing . criticism over its nuclear weapons ambitions. Disarmament talks . including the Koreas, the United States, Japan, China and Russia fell . apart in 2009. Several rounds of U.N. sanctions have . not encouraged the North to give up its small cache of nuclear devices, . which Pyongyang says it must not only keep but expand to protect itself . from a hostile Washington. Pyongyang's tone has softened somewhat . recently, following weeks of violent rhetoric, including threats of . nuclear war and missile strikes. There have been tentative signs of . interest in diplomacy after a major source of North Korean outrage - the . annual U.S.-South Korean military drills - ended this week. Tensions: The sentencing of Kenneth Bae will further complicate already strained relations between Pyongyang and Washington. North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un (3rd left) is pictured at a soccer match . In Washington, the U.S. State . Department said it was working with the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang to . confirm the report of Mr Bae's sentencing.

'committing hostile acts' against North Korea took place in the Supreme . Court on Tuesday, the state-run Korean Central News Agency reported. North Korea's state-run news agency KCNA referred to Mr Bae as Pae Jun Ho, the North Korean spelling for his Korean name. He was arrested in early November in . Rason, a special economic zone in North Korea's far north-east which . borders China and Russia, state media said. The exact nature of his . alleged crimes has not been revealed. Friends and colleagues say Mr Bae was . based in the Chinese border city of Dalian and travelled frequently to . North Korea to feed orphans. Mr Bae's mother in the U.S. did not answer calls seeking comment, the Associated Press reported.

They later were pardoned on . humanitarian grounds and released to Bill Clinton, who met with . then-leader Kim Jong Il. U.S.-North Korea talks came later that year. Jimmy Carter visited North Korea in . 2011 to negotiate the release of imprisoned American Aijalon Gomes, who . had been sentenced to eight years of hard labour for crossing illegally . into the North from China. Korean American Eddie Jun was released . in 2011 after Robert King, the U.S. envoy on North Korean human rights, . travelled to Pyongyang.

A young father was gunned down in his bathroom just yards from his sleeping four-year-old son, police have revealed. Jordan Stapleton, 21, was shot at around 11.45pm on Tuesday at his home in Leeds, West Yorkshire, and police have appealed for an unnamed man who made the 999 call moments after to come forward.

Ten million beefburgers are being recalled in the scandal over horse meat contamination, it emerged yesterday. As revulsion over the issue grew, more supermarkets and fast food chain Burger King were drawn into the row. Sainsbury’s, Asda and the Co-op have decided to remove thousands of packs of frozen burgers as a precautionary measure. The firms acted because the products were made by an Irish food giant which is known to have been supplying burgers contaminated with horse meat. Empty shelves: Tesco had taken its frozen burgers off the shelves today . Not for sale: Tesco in Bristol had removed all its own brand burgers from sale today . Separately, Burger King confirmed it gets burgers from the same company. However, it said there has been an ‘absolute assurance’ that these are not contaminated. Food watchdogs in the UK and Ireland are racing to establish whether products made for other retailers, take-aways and restaurants are contaminated. Last night the Government and the Food Standards Agency announced a UK wide survey into the authenticity of burgers and other processed meat products. The revelations have been met with anger and disgust, while the companies involved face prosecutions for misleading shoppers. Speaking at Prime Minister’s Question Time, David Cameron, said: ‘People in our country will have been very concerned to read this morning that when they thought they were buying beefburgers they were buying something with horse meat in it. This is a completely unacceptable state of affairs.’ He warned the stores involved, saying: ‘Ultimately retailers have to be responsible for what it is they sell and where it comes from.’ The alert was first raised by Irish food watchdogs earlier this week after horse DNA was found in burgers sold through Tesco, Iceland, Aldi, Lidl and Dunnes in Ireland. what goes into a value burger.jpg . It subsequently emerged that burgers from the same batches were sold in the British outlets of both Tesco and Iceland. The beef content in one Everyday Value burger sold by Tesco was actually 29 per cent horse meat. The tests were carried out in November but the results were not released until they had been checked by experts in Germany. It is likely that many thousands of the burgers contaminated with horse meat have been eaten by families. Investigations are focussing on the role of Irish food company, ABP, which is run by controversial entrepreneur Larry Goodman. ABP owns Silvercrest Foods, which supplied burgers containing horse meat to Tesco and Aldi. It also makes cheap burgers for Asda, Co-op and Burger King. ABP also owns Dalepak, which is based in North Yorkshire and made suspect burgers for Iceland. It also produces 13 lines for Sainsbury’s. Yesterday, ABP pointed the finger at a mystery ingredient used in the burgers – thought to be a protein powder – supplied by two foreign firms, one in the Netherlands and another in Spain. Worry: David Cameron said that people were concerned about the horse meat revelations at Prime Minister's Question Time today . The powder – used to bulk up cheap burgers – is supposed to be created from rendered down carcasses of beef animals. The episode lifts the lid on some of the more distasteful elements and ingredients used to produce cheap food for families on a budget. Professor Chris Elliott, director of the Institute for Global Food Security at Queen’s University, Belfast said: ‘What goes into a burger is all the low quality cuts of meat that can’t be sold in any other form. They are at the bottom of the chain.’ The FSA will look at launching legal action with breaches of food labelling rules bringing fines up to £20,000 and a prison term of up to two years. Headlines: The news that horse meat had been found in supermarket burgers was revealed yesterday . The Irish research also identified that a number of other beef products, such as ready meal cottage pies, contained pig meat that was not declared on the label. This has serious implications for the Muslim and Jewish communities who are forbidden from eating pork. Tesco had no idea about the contamination and has apologised. Its group technical director, Tim Smith, said: ‘Our customers have the right to expect that food they buy is produced to the highest standards.’ Asda, Sainsbury’s and the Co-op all insisted there was no evidence their burgers contain horse meat. However, they decided to withdraw them because they come from firms  which are known to have had this problem. Gone: Burgers had also been removed from other supermarkets today. Asda in Chelmsford, Essex is pictured . Same supplier: Fast food giant Burger King was drawn into the row today as it uses the same supplier as supermarkets where burgers were found to contain horse meat . Sainsbury’s said: ‘Although our products have not been implicated, as our customers would expect we treat matters like this extremely seriously.’ Asda said: ‘As soon as we were made aware of the issue we launched a full traceability audit with our supplier.’ Co-op said it was removing two lines of frozen own-brand burgers while tests are carried out ‘to ensure they have been produced to our strict specifications’. Burger King said it has been given ‘absolute assurance’ by ABP and Silvercrest that none of its burgers were affected. It said its burgers are produced with clean ingredients on a separate production line. For many, it is simply a matter of economics. While calling the vet to put down a lame or surplus horse can cost in excess of £200, abattoirs will gladly pay £300 for an unwanted animal. As a result, 8,118 horses and ponies were slaughtered in Britain in 2011, to be sent to the continent to be sold as gourmet meat. Nothing is wasted, with their skins going into the leather trade, while any off-cuts will be used as dog food. Most will be former pets their owners cannot care for or riding school mounts that can no longer pay their way because they are too old to work. But according to Ben Martin, a campaigner with charity Animal Aid, in 2011 ‘1,127 were thoroughbreds discarded by the racing industry’, which ‘overproduces horses each year’. The number of British horses ending their days in the slaughterhouse has doubled since 2008, a little-known consequence of the recession. Mr Martin said around 10,000 horses and ponies are now believed to be slaughtered in Britain each year. ‘With belt-tightening following the recession, it is often luxuries such as horses that face the chop,’ he said. ‘It makes sense they would end up in slaughterhouses rather than paying a vet a  fee or trying to sell them on. ‘The real scandal behind the horse slaughter figures is that the volume of horses being produced for the pet and horse racing industries is unregulated and out of control.’ Permitted methods of slaughter include shooting with a bullet, or stunning with a penetrative bolt followed by immediate bleeding. There are two major abattoirs that take horses in Britain, but they are not keen on publicising it. Several thousand live horses are believed to be sent to the continent for slaughter. Customers in France, Belgium and Italy like horse meat. Small amounts are also eaten in Spain, Portugal, Holland and Romania. A spokesman for the Food Standards Agency said almost all British horse meat is exported. ‘It is legal to slaughter and sell horse meat in the UK, provided it is from an approved abattoir and the meat must carry the stamp declaring it is fit for human consumption,’ he added.","Sainsbury's, Asda and Co-op have removed burgers as a precaution .

Findings: The police marksman who shot Azelle Rodney dead in north London in 2005 had 'no lawful justification' for doing so, an official report said . A firearms officer could face trial over the death of a drug dealer in a bungled operation. Azelle Rodney, 24, was ‘executed’ in a hail of bullets when his car was stopped by police marksmen who suspected he was about to rob Colombian rivals. The armed officer let off eight shots in less than two seconds from a high-powered carbine at almost point-blank range, claiming he feared the suspect was about to fire a submachine gun. But a retired High Court judge questioned his account yesterday, ruling there was ‘no lawful justification’ for shooting him dead. In a highly critical judgment, Sir Christopher Holland castigated almost every aspect of the dangerous operation in April 2005. He accused the officer, known only as E7, of firing ‘pre-emptive’ shots as police moved in to stop the car carrying three suspected gunmen. And he said he did not believe E7 held an ‘honest belief’ that Rodney posed a lethal threat. Sir Christopher also criticised the lack of planning, excessive force in the so-called ‘hard stop’ and the chaotic aftermath. His inquiry ruling contradicts the findings of independent investigators and marks a turning point in a long-running legal battle. Rodney’s mother said her son was ‘executed’ and demanded an apology from Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe. It also emerged that: . Lawyers for E7, who retired in 2008 to work as a firearms consultant, have already informed Sir Christopher they will seek a judicial review of his ‘irrational’ findings. He was one of the most respected officers in the Yard’s elite CO19 unit and won seven commendations during a 33-year career. Scroll down for video . Shooting: Mr Rodney's silver VW Golf, circled in red, was stopped by armed police in front of bystanders, circled in white, gathered outside the Railway Tavern in Edgware, north London in 2005 . 'No justification': Mr Rodney was shot six times, once each in the arm and back, and four times in the head . In 1987, he killed two armed robbers . during a raid at a South London abattoir. In 2008, after bumping into . him at a social function, former deputy assistant commissioner Sue Akers . – who later led the phone-hacking inquiry – told him: ‘I’ve always . wanted to meet the Met’s very own serial killer.’ E7 complained and was awarded £5,000 for ‘hurt feelings’ over the ill-judged joke. The Rodney inquiry findings are a . vindication for campaigners – including the Daily Mail, which fiercely . opposed the introduction of secret inquests. Police repeatedly fought for large swathes of evidence to be heard in secret, supposedly to protect intelligence sources. But experts suspect their real . motivation was to protect senior officers from humiliation as their . shortcomings were systematically exposed. They believe much of the evidence . revealed during Sir Christopher’s public inquiry would have been covered . up had new legislation been in force. Rodney was shot dead as he travelled with two other men in a VW Golf through Edgware, North London, on April 30, 2005. Sir Christopher criticised the Met . for failing to minimise the danger to Rodney when it planned the . operation, instead leaving vital decisions to armed officers on the . ground. Rodney’s mother, Susan Alexander, said the report backed her view that he was ‘executed’ by the police. She added: ‘This report has found . that there was no lawful justification for my son’s killing by the . police. Azelle’s death was wholly avoidable. 'I shouldn’t be sitting here now, beginning another chapter in my fight for justice for him. Critical: Azelle Rodney's mother Susan Alexander is seen flanked by Leslie Thomas from Garden Court Chambers (left) and solicitor Daniel Machover (right) as the inquiry's findings were published today . ‘The fact that he was strongly . suspected in being involved in crime does not justify him or anyone else . being summarily killed.’ Isabella Sankey, of Liberty, which . campaigns against secret inquests, said: ‘Successive governments used . this case to try to justify closed hearings, yet the inquiry did its job . without hearing any secret evidence whatsoever. ‘Let’s never forget how secrecy can be used as a cloak for illegality, embarrassment and abuses of power.’ Sir Bernard said: ‘We plan our . operations to confront the armed and dangerous so as to minimise . wherever possible the use of lethal force.’ Grief: A framed photograph of Azelle Rodney sat in front of his mother (left) today as the report into the findings of a public inquiry into the 24-year-old's (right) death was published . The day officer E7 killed 2 robbers . Before killing Azelle Rodney with six bullets, E7 had shot dead two armed robbers at an abattoir. The marksman was among a team that hid inside a rental van at a meat depot after receiving a tip-off about an armed raid. He watched as robbers armed with sawn-off shotguns ran from woods to hijack a Securicor van which contained £120,000. Emerging from the police van, E7 . killed two robbers with two shots each, fearing they were about to gun . down the  Securicor driver. The extraordinary 1987 confrontation . in Plumstead, South East London, was one of dozens in the officer’s . tumultuous 33-year career. In 1978 he was commended for bravery after . taking part in the unarmed arrest of a dangerous gun-carrying villain. E7 was the first member of the Yard’s . specialist firearms unit, then called D11, to fire an ‘operational . shot’ when saving a girl of four during a siege in December 1985. Damning report: Police are seen removing a silver VW Golf believed to be the car Azelle Rodney was travelling in when he was shot in Edgeware in 2005 . He twice shot the kidnapper who later . stood trial. The marksman received a commander’s commendation in the . 1990s after an armed stand-off with a gunman in a minicab office. He said: ‘I could tell that his heart . wasn’t in it and I screamed “armed police” at him and the man dropped . the gun when I was just about to open fire.’ In 2004, the Independent Police . Complaints Commission recommended that E7 be given ‘words of advice’ following an armed operation. It was claimed that he left a police . car without permission during the operation to test his radio and buy . coffee. E7 said his superiors thought it was ‘a storm in a teacup’. Another low point followed his arrest during a drunken brawl at a nightclub in Covent Garden, central London, in December 2000. Admitting it was ‘not one of my . proudest moments’, he told the inquiry: ‘I ended up with about four or . five bouncers on top of me and I ended up in a fight. ‘We all do silly things occasionally . when we drink but I was old enough and wise enough to know better. It . was one of those situations that got out of hand.’ Shortly before he retired, E7 was . involved in the bizarre ‘serial killer’ encounter with Met chief Sue . Akers for which he won £5,000 in compensation and an apology. Investigation: Forensic investigators are seen outside the Railway Tavern pub in the wake of the shooting . By the time he left the frontline in . 2008, E7 had received seven commendations and was training a new . generation of elite gun cops for Scotland Yard. He now works as a consultant for a . firearms and ammunition company. A former senior officer who worked with . E7 on numerous operations, described him as a ‘consummate . professional’. He said: ‘Being a firearms officer is . one of the toughest jobs in the police because you’re damned if you do . and damned if you don’t. Officers have tough choices to make. Sometimes, . armed criminals leave you with little choice. It’s either shoot them or . risk the public being hurt. ‘In the years I’ve known the officer referred to as E7, I’ve always founded him to be very grounded and not gung-ho. ‘He often put himself in the most dangerous positions on an operation because he was one of the best. ‘He would see things in slow motion and therefore had longer to process what was happening than other officers.’","Azelle Rodney, 24, gunned down in Edgware, north London, in 2005 .

Four of the tragic child victims of Sandy Hook Elementary School gunman Adam Lanza lived within short walking distance of the $1.5 million home the killer shared with his mother, whom he also killed. The startling measure of how close knit the community of Sandy Hook  really is comes as it was revealed that one of the victims of the school massacre, six-year old Dylan Hockley, was a neighbor to the 20-year-old shooter. And it is now known that three other victims, Jessica Rekos, 6, Grace McDonnell, 6, and Chase Kowalski, 7, all lived within a one-mile radius of the troubled killer who shot dead 26 people in cold blood, including 20 children 1st grade children at the Connecticut school on Friday.

Modest compared to the other properties in the area, the Kowalski's declined to speak to the media and the police officer assigned to their home said that the family was grief stricken.

"By . Claudia Joseph . PUBLISHED: . 20:06 EST, 26 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 20:06 EST, 26 May 2012 . It was a very public death. In the grey light of dawn, the body of a man was found hanging from scaffolding underneath Blackfriars Bridge in Central London, his feet dangling in the water. He was wearing an expensive Italian suit and his pockets  were weighted with bricks and stuffed with cash. Family moment: Italian financier Roberto Calvi (right) and his son Carlo in a picture taken by Carlo's sister Anna in 1982, the year Roberto was found hanging under Blackfriars Bridge in London . Initially police believed that Italian financier Roberto Calvi, known as ‘God’s banker’ because of his close financial ties with the Vatican, had committed suicide. But the dead man’s son, Carlo Calvi, commissioned an independent forensic report, which concluded in October 2002 that he had been murdered. In 2005, Italian prosecutors brought murder charges against five suspects but all were acquitted after the subsequent trial in Rome. Now, 30 years after his father was found dead, Carlo remains convinced that he was murdered and wants police to reopen the case. Carlo believes that up to a dozen men from the Italian underworld were involved in the murder – and claims many are still at large in London. ‘A long time has passed since my father’s murder on June 18, 1982,’ he said. ‘It is not unrealistic to believe that there are individuals involved in his death still alive. I want the City of London Police to pursue these individuals and put them where they belong. It is a matter of public interest. These people are still operating in London. We should all know who they are and what they are doing.’ 'Crime scene': The jury at the second inquest in 1983 visit the spot where Calvi was found hanging under Blackfriars Bridge . Carlo, aged 58 and himself a former banker, has dedicated his life to seeking justice for his father, who was the chairman of Italy’s second-largest bank, Banco Ambrosiano. The bank subsequently collapsed with debts  of half a billion pounds amid dark rumours of laundered Mafia drug money, a link with the clandestine ‘P2’ Masonic lodge and secret political slush funds. Now living in Montreal, Canada, Carlo spends his time travelling between his home and London, New York and Milan – sifting through  evidence, meeting secretive contacts willing to talk about Italian organised crime and poring over the transcripts of Mafia trials. His obsession with finding the men involved in his father’s murder has come at a price – both financial and personal. He has spent £15 million on fees for lawyers, private detectives and other experts in an attempt to identify the guilty. And his marriage to Marie Josee, mother of his two sons, Roberto, 18, and Nicola, 16, broke up in 2000. He has also not seen his sister Anna, 55, a lecturer at Warwick University, since their mother’s death from Parkinson’s disease in 2006. ‘There’s no doubt I have fixated on the case,’ he said. ‘I’m sure that played a part in my divorce and it has affected my relationship with my sister. She doesn’t necessarily agree with the things I have done.’ Call to re-open case: Carlo believes up to a dozen men from the Italian underworld were involved in the murder of his father (pictured) and claims many are still at large in London . Carlo was a 28-year-old post-graduate student at Washington’s Georgetown University when he recieved the telephone call that would change his life. His mother Clara, then 60, and sister Anna, 25, were staying with him in Washington, having been warned by his father that their lives were in danger. ‘My mother had been living with me in America for about six weeks because my father feared for her safety,’ he recalled. ‘My sister arrived the day before he died. We were awoken by the telephone in the middle of the night when my uncle Luciano, my mother’s brother, called from Bologna to say that he had heard the news on the radio. ‘He spoke to my mother who had a complete breakdown. She was devastated. We had to call a doctor. I remember telling my uncle that he could have been more careful with his words. I think he was a little too direct.’ Within hours the family had been escorted by American police to a secret apartment in the Watergate complex, famous for the break-in that brought about the fall of President Richard Nixon. They spent the next few weeks under police guard before returning to Carlo’s home. ‘My mother never recovered from my father’s death,’ said Carlo. ‘She and my father had always dreamed  of living near Lake Como. They were very close and she remained very attached to her dreams. ‘The following year, she suffered  the first symptoms of Parkinson’s. I don’t think she got it as a direct result of my father’s murder – but surely it doesn’t help if you have lived through such a shock?’ Carlo’s quest for the truth began a month after his father’s death when  a London inquest recorded a verdict of suicide. It was hardly a likely explanation. Six days before his death, Calvi had shaved off his moustache and skipped bail in Italy pending an appeal against a four-year suspended prison sentence for illegally transferring £18 million out of the country. Fearing for his life, the 62-year-old banker chartered a private plane and fled to Britain on a false passport with Sardinian business tycoon Silvano  Vittor, a long-term associate who assumed the role of bodyguard. He was taken to a safe house in Chelsea Cloisters, West London – believed to have been organised by another Sardinian businessman, Flavio Carboni. Calvi had already written to Pope John Paul II  warning him of the imminent collapse of Banco Ambrosiano, saying that it would ‘provoke a catastrophe of unimaginable proportions in which the Church will suffer the gravest damage’. Roberto Calvi (back left), known as 'God's banker' because of close ties to the Vatican, with other top Italian financiers who appeared in court in 1981 charged with illegal export of funds abroad . Calvi also had close links to the Mafia, the Neapolitan Camorra – a Mafia-like criminal organisation based in Naples – and the Masonic lodge P2. The latter was described by Calvi’s former Banco Ambrosiano mentor, Sicilian Michele  Sindona, as a ‘state within a state’ because of its powerful members, including former Italian Prime  Minister Silvio Berlusconi. Carlo refused to accept the 1982 inquest’s suicide verdict. He hired one of Britain’s best-known barristers, George Carman QC, to represent the family at a second hearing, which recorded an open verdict. Still not satisfied, he demanded that his father’s body was exhumed. Carlo then commissioned the  independent forensic report, which concluded in October 2002 that his father had been murdered as the injuries to his neck were inconsistent with hanging, there was no trace of rust and paint on his shoes from the scaffolding and he had not touched the bricks in his pockets. In 2005, Vittor and Carboni were accused of killing Calvi. But the duo and three others – Mafia financier Pippo Calò, businessman Ernesto Diotallevi and Carboni’s girlfriend Manuela  Kleinszig – were acquitted 20 months later. Another name linked to Calvi’s murder was Mafia ‘supergrass’ Francesco Di Carlo, known as ‘Frankie the Strangler’. Determined: Carlo Calvi (pictured) has dedicated his life to seeking justice for his father . According to Di Carlo, the killers were Vincenzo Casillo and Sergio Vaccari of the Naples Camorra. ‘Calvi was naming names,’ said Di Carlo. ‘No one had any trust in him any more. He owed a lot of money. His friends had all distanced themselves. Everyone wanted to get rid of him. I was in Rome and received a phone call from a friend in Sicily telling me that a certain high- ranking Mafia member had just been killed. ‘I will never forget the date because of this: it was June 16, 1982 – two days before Calvi was murdered. The friend told me that Pippo Calò was trying to get hold of me because he needed me to do something for him,’ Di Carlo claims. ‘When I finally spoke to Pippo, he told me not to worry, that the problem had been taken care of. ‘That’s a code we use in the Cosa Nostra. We never talk about killing someone. We say they have been taken care of.’ Carlo Calvi believes that the supergrass is telling the truth. He agrees with Di Carlo that his father’s killers were Casillo – the second-in-command of the Camorra, who was  murdered by a car bomb in Rome in 1983 – and his sidekick Vaccari, who was stabbed to death three months after Calvi’s murder. Vaccari was also a former tenant of Calvi’s last known home, the rented flat at Chelsea Cloisters. Carlo points out that both his father and Casillo had business cards belonging to Alvaro Giardili, a Camorra associate, in their possession when they died. ‘I’m not suggesting Alvaro Giardili was involved, but he definitely  connects to some of the individuals involved in the case,’ Carlo said. ‘When my father died, he had Giardili’s business card in his wallet. ‘One of the first people to ring us when we returned to the house after my father died was Giardili. In general, I consider Di Carlo a reliable witness. But I am more interested in what he has to say about the social network of the Italian underground in London during the Eighties.’ It is that underground movement that Carlo is now hoping will be exposed – even if his own safety  is jeopardised. Calling for a third inquest, he said: ‘The police have already admitted it was murder but I would like to see the case reviewed in open court and the remaining defendants in their jurisdiction pursued. ‘When I lived in Italy I had bodyguards but now I have to rely on my own judgment and instinct. ‘There have been instances when I have been concerned for my safety but I try not to be confrontational and protect myself. ‘If the worst happens, I am not the only person who has this information. I will not rest until I find out the truth about my father’s death.’","Son of 'God's banker' Roberto Calvi talks 30 years after father's death .

"By . Sam Webb . PUBLISHED: . 10:10 EST, 24 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:16 EST, 24 April 2013 . Genson Courtney was shot through the left eye on July 3, 2011. His uncle David Pinto, 33, and Robert Bleach, 46, both of Greenwich, south-east London, deny murdering him . The stepson of celebrity gangster Dave Courtney was 'shot through the eye by his uncle in a cold blooded execution,’ a court heard today. Approximately two weeks before cagefighter and drug dealer Genson Courtney, 23, was shot getting into a car outside his girlfriend’s South East London address he had ‘battered’ his stepfather on Plumstead Common, jurors were told. The court heard how Genson Courtney also wanted to sette scores with other members of his family, in particular his uncle, David Pinto, who he claimed owed him £1,100. After the fight with his stepfather, Genson Courtney called Pinto and demanded the money back, threatening to terrorise his friends. He then went to Pinto’s home and the door was answered by Pinto’s partner, who was there with their children. Genson Courtney was at the front door shouting for 15 minutes, claiming he should have something from the house to settle the debt. He also sent threatening text messages to Pinto. Jonathan Rees, QC, prosecuting said Genson Courtney also had a grudge against Pinto because he had once thrashed him in front of his friends for playing truant. He said: ‘Against this background the prosecution suggest that the motive behind the killing was that David Pinto was concerned that Genson Courtney was after him and sought to eliminate the threat he posed.’ Genson Courtney was found slumped in his Volkswagen Golf outside his girlfriend’s house in Greenwich, on July 3, 2011. Writer: The victim's stepfather is former gangster-turned writer Dave Courtney . ‘The bullet travelled through the eye socket and into the brain, lodging at the rear of the skull. ‘It caused a fatal injury resulting in his death some five hours later,’ the prosecution said. ‘The shooting had the hallmarks of a cold blooded execution. ‘The evidence suggests the gunman was lying in wait for Mr Courtney as he left his girlfriend’s flat to get into her car which was parked on the road outside. ‘The gunman managed to get very close to his target and fired only one shot to the head; it seems that a getaway car was waiting nearby.’ The court heard there were no witnesses to the killing or CCTV footage and the prosecution will rely on circumstantial evidence to prove the case. David Pinto, 33, and Robert Bleach, 46, both of Greenwich, south-east London, deny murdering him on July 3, 2011. The court heard how on June 22, 2011, Genson Courtney had woken ‘in a bad mood’ and had got into an argument with his stepfather about the mortgage payments on Camelot, the family home in Plumstead. Mr Rees said of Dave Courtney, 54: ‘He is a man who in the past has courted media attention and had a reputation as a former gangster well-connected in the criminal underworld.’ The two men went to the nearby common and ‘Genson Courtney punched his stepfather, knocking him to the ground’, said Mr Rees. Jennifer Courtney, the victim's mother and sister of Pinto, the man accused of murdering his nephew . ‘In total, he hit Dave Courtney three times before he drove off leaving him bloodied and battered.’ Later that day, he was stopped from striking Dave Courtney with a golf club saying: ‘Do you remember when you knocked me out in the past?’ Genson Courtney was the son of Jennifer Pinto and took Courtney’s name when his mother separated from his father and began a relationship with the gangland celebrity. Dave Courtney has written several books about his life of crime with some of the legends of the underworld and has had bit parts in several films. At the time of his death, Genson Courtney had a long list of convictions and was jailed for six years for rape in 2006. Some of the jail time he served overlapped with his stepfather, and while he was inside Genson told his relative he wanted to get physically bigger so he could rob drug dealers when he got out. He was dealing drugs at the time of his death and was making over £1,000 a week. Mr Courtney was also training every day at his local gym and taking steroids to bulk up his body. He confessed to taking money from dealers before he died, and was in dispute with some traffickers who were selling on his patch. The trial was adjourned until Thursday.

The husband of a Brooklyn high-school teacher accused of having sex with a 16-year-old student is finally divorcing his wife. Jimmy Lathrop, 40, was humiliated when his spouse Erin Sayar, 36, was arrested for allegedly smoking pot and sleeping with a high-school football player. According to court records he filed divorce papers in late January and has already moved out of their Park Slope apartment. Marriage over:  Erin Sayar, left, is being divorced by husband Jimmy Lathrop, right, in the aftermath of last year's scandal that she had repeatedly slept with a student . ‘Mr. Lathrop has full confidence in . the judicial system, and hopes for a speedy resolution of his divorce as . he moves on with his life,’ his attorney Todd Spodek told the New York . Post. Sayar was arrested last May and charged with 50 counts of statutory rape and sexual abuse. One reason Lathrop wants a divorce is that if his wife pleads - or is found guilty - she’ll be branded a sex offender. That would limit her activities with . their young daughter because it would prevent Sayar from being around . the child’s friends or even visiting playgrounds. In the aftermath of the case becoming public knowledge, Lathrop denied the couple was getting divorced last summer. 'We’re doing fine. We’re doing . awesome,' he had told the New York Post last June. 'No, there’s nothing . true about that, at all. We’re not getting a divorce.' Married mother: Erin Sayar, 36, turned herself in last June and was charged with rape, criminal sex act, sexual misconduct, and sexual abuse . Sayar faces four years behind bars for alleged sexual encounters with the high school football player; she's pictured returning to her Brooklyn home . Mother-of-one Sayer is accused of seducing football player Kevin Eng, 16, while she was a teacher at Brooklyn's James Madison High School. Lathrop was pictured with his wide when she appeared at Brooklyn Criminal Court last June for arraignment. He wore a fedora and . glasses, and walking several steps ahead of his wife, who looked . disheveled in a bright pink track suit. She was released on $10,000 bond after turned herself into the NYPD Special Victims Squad and was charged with eight counts of third-degree rape and criminal sexual conduct. Sayar is currently suspended from her job without pay pending the result of the criminal case. As Judge Kevin McGrath set bail, he also issued an order of protection for the student. Sayar - who is facing more than four . years in jail - was supposed to be tutoring the footballer in her office . while his teammates were using the weight room next door. Chaos: Numerous news crews surrounded Sayer (centre) as she left court last June with husband Jimmy Lathrop (second from front) walking in front of her . The parents of the 16-year-old have also filed a $10million lawsuit against the married English teacher. According to the Post, Kevin was boasting about the sexual trysts on Facebook and to other students in detention. Football teammate Eddie Reid, 16, said they quickly grew suspicious, telling the Post: 'We had weight training every day in . sixth period, but instead of going to the weight room, Kevin was going . to her office — and the door was locked. 'People would go to the door and try and open it. She’d just yell ""Go to class!"" and ""Get out of the hallway!"",' Reid said. The lawyer representing Eng is . claiming his client was traumatized by what happened and that it left him . the 'subject of scorn and ridicule'. But other students said he was proud of the affair. The school found out about the alleged sexual relationship when Kevin's girlfriend became suspicious last November. Teacher Erin Sayar is charged with rape in a case in which authorities say she had sex with a 17-year-old student . After hacking Eng's Facebook account, . the girl found messages he had sent to Sayar which read, 'I love you so . much' and 'I always loved you, since last year'. Sayar replied: 'Oh no - I’m not putting myself out there again. I made that mistake last night and you couldn’t handle it.' Despite this, the teacher gave the boy her mobile number and ordered him to delete their conversations. Devastated, the girl informed school officials of the pair's exchanges, and confronted her boyfriend. According to the school's report, Eng admitted having oral sex and intercourse with Sayar between eight to 12 times. The New York Post reports that the lovers exchanged an incredible 3,856 text messages over a 17-day period in December, an average of 227 per day. One midnight tryst apparently saw Sayar pick the boy up from his house in her car. Allegations: She is accused of having sex with 16-year-old pupil Kevin Eng in her office at James Madison High School . 'Eventually, they began kissing and then engaged in sexual intercourse and oral sex inside the SUV,' the report said, adding that the boy had described tattoos on intimate parts of Sayar’s body. A spokesman for the Department of Education said Sayar, who earns just over $78,000 (£50,000) a year, is still technically employed at the school, although she was removed from the classroom in January. The school investigators have submitted their report to Brooklyn's District Attorney Charles Hynes, strongly recommending she be fired. Eng, who is now 17, is still a pupil at the school. The sordid allegations are not the first to hit James Madison High School, christened 'Horndog High' after its past sex scandals. Language teachers Cindy Mauro and Alini Brito were dismissed from their posts after an alleged lesbian romp in a school classroom in November 2009 - a claim they both denied. Prior to that, 29-year-old English teacher Craig Roffman was sacked and arrested in 2005 after he was found emailing child pornography.","Alleged affair was uncovered last year when the 16-year-old's girlfriend hacked his Facebook account .

In retreat: David Cameron is expected to put on hold his plans to legalise gay marriage and modernise the House of Lords . David Cameron is expected to put on hold his plans to legalise gay marriage and modernise the House of Lords after his party's miserable showing in local elections sparked a backlash from angry Tory backbenchers. The Prime Minister wants to make same-sex weddings lawful and to reform the system of unelected peers. But he is expected to make only a vague pledge to reform the House of Lords in this week's Queen's speech, avoiding any firm commitments to implement the policy. Mr Cameron is also understood to be ready to put the gay marriage plans on the backburner. The retreat comes after Conservative MPs called on Mr Cameron to return to traditional Tory values following Thursday's elections, in which the party lost 12 councils and 405 seats. Downing Street sources say the Prime Minister has recognised that he cannot push ahead with the controversial plans with support for the party waning. George Osborne today indicated the reforms were being kicked into the long grass. The Chancellor said he had taken the message from voters that ministers should be focusing 'on the things that really matter' rather than getting 'distracted' by too many other issues. Mr Osborne said he was personally in favour of gay marriage but he denied there had been plans to bring forward a Bill in the Queen's speech. He said the party was committed in its manifesto to 'looking' at Lords reform but it was 'not the priority of the Government'. Mr Osborne added that the Government would ""learn"" from the verdict delivered at the ballot box on Thursday. He told BBC1's The Andrew Marr Show: 'I think what people are saying is focus on the things that really matter, focus on the economy and on education and welfare. 'Focus on those things, don't get distracted by too many other issues.' Controversial: Dissent is growing among backbench Tory MPs about the Prime Minister's plans to allow gay couples to wed . Mr Osborne said it was clearly 'not . the case' that voters had deserted the Conservatives in the elections as . a result of gay marriage proposals or Lords reform. But he said that while Parliament would debate the planned shake-up of the upper chamber, it was not a 'priority'. He added: 'We are focused on the really important issues that matter to people. 'Parliament can discuss these issues, . Parliament is very good at discussing these issues, but it is certainly . not my priority, the priority of the Government. 'It is not where the efforts of the Government and the executive are going to be directed.' Pressure grew on Mr Cameron within . the party after Boris Johnson managed to overturn a 19-point Labour lead . to secure re-election as London mayor. Mr Johnson emphasised his right-wing . credentials during the successful campaign and attacked the Government . for its record on traditional Tory concerns such as immigration, tax . cuts and Europe. The . mayor's victory prompted calls for Mr Cameron to rein in 'wind turbine . Toryism' and concentrate on the issues of most importance to . Conservative voters. Backtrack: George Osborne told Andrew Marr that the party was committed in its manifesto to 'looking' at Lords reform but it was 'not the priority of the Government' Right-wing . Tory MPs led by David Davis and John Redwood believe a more radical . economic strategy is needed to tackle the country's problems. They are in favour of targeted tax cuts, deeper spending cuts and an end to expensive environmental regulation. With such concern over the Government's direction, Mr Cameron's plans to modernise the House of Lords and allow gay couples to wed risk angering backbench MPs even more. A Downing Street source told the Sunday Times: 'Gay marriage is something we genuinely want to do, but because of everything that has happened now is not the time.' Priorities: Nadine Dorries says Britons are 'screaming out' for strong policies on law and order, a stable NHS and an in-out referendum on Europe . It is understood that Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, will hold talks with Mr Cameron and urge him to pursue policies for growth and increased flexibility in the jobs market. The committee's executive will also meet chief whip Patrick McLoughlin and warn him about the dissent among Tory MPs and voters about gay marriage and Lords reform. Mark Pritchard, secretary of the committee, said the party's council election defeat was not due to 'mid-term blues' - the dip in support often seen by governments halfway through their time in power. 'It would be high risk to continue to take our natural supporters in the country and the party for granted,' Mr Pritchard said. 'If the public believe our priorities are not their priorities, and it sticks, no amount of relaunches will suffice.' Tory MP Nadine Dorrries, who last month branded Mr Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne 'arrogant posh boys', has also called for a change in direction. Criticism: Cardinal Keith O'Brien accused Mr Cameron of attempting to 'redefine marriage' for a 'small minority of activists' She said: 'While Britons scream out for strong policies on law and order, a stable NHS and an in-out referendum on Europe to cut us free from basket-case Southern European economies, Cameron makes gay marriage and Lords reform his priorities. 'Even those who have no deep understanding of economics recognise that we need a strategy for growth, lower taxes, enterprise schemes to help local entrepreneurs, free-flowing bank capital and raising tax thresholds for the lower paid.' Mr Cameron's support for gay marriage is particularly controversial. In March Cardinal Keith O'Brien accused him of attempting to 'redefine marriage' for a 'small minority of activists'. Defeat: The retreat comes after the Conservatives suffered heavy losses in local elections. Labour, led by Ed Miliband, made gains . Cardinal O'Brien insisted that the reforms would ‘shame the United Kingdom in the eyes of the world'. Mr Cameron is believed to have warmed to the idea of a referendum on Lords reform, which could be held as late as 2015. The Queen's speech is expected to underline the importance of the family and to include a bill to reform maternity and parental leave. Other proposals to promote marriage and family life are likely to include the offer of extra support for couples who are about to break up. Divorced fathers could be given more rights to care for their children, except in domestic violence cases. Tough measures on crime are also expected, along with a bill on banking reform.","House of Lords reform also to be put on hold by the Prime Minister .

No 10 is irritated that Farah, who won two golds at the London Olympics, did not get a knighthood, while Kelly Holmes, who won two track golds at the 2004 Athens Games, became a Dame. Civil servants have told ministers that he could not get a top honour since he did not have an MBE already. Archaic rules mean Jimmy Savile, branded a serial paedophile by a recent police report, cannot be stripped of his knighthood posthumously . Arcane rules mean Sir Jimmy Savile, branded a paedophile by a police report, cannot be stripped of his gong after death. Ministers have intervened to demand new rights to bypass the civil service after it emerged that more mandarins got gongs this year than Olympians, with just 68 British athletes receiving honours compared to 124 civil servants and quangocrats. It is understood that at a Cabinet meeting before Christmas, ministers agreed to seize control of the honours system. Tories are amazed that the civil servant . at the Department of Education who is responsible for picking those who . get honours was himself granted an gong this year. Honours Secretary . Darryl Cooper was granted an MBE in the New Year's Honours. A senior Whitehall source said: 'This isn't even gongs for the boys, it's gongs for the boys who hand out the gongs.' A No 10 source added: ‘Of course we wanted Mo Farah to get a knighthood but they get very sniffy about the rules. There is all this stuff about having a small one first and working your way up. The  public would be mystified.’ Other ministers, like Tory Chairman . Grant Shapps, have grown irritated with the system when civil mandarins . repeatedly rejected their nominees without providing any explanation. 'Grant kept putting forward officials . who have helped push through important reforms but there was radio . silence. He eventually learned that civil service bosses were selecting . people who were retiring instead. He forced this issue and both people . got gongs. We're seeing a change,' the source added. The shake-up has been ordered after anger that figures such as Mo Farah didn't get a knighthood in this year's honours list . Ministers are reported to have been angry at arcane rules which allowed Kelly Holmes to be a Dame after winning two gold medals in 2004 but Mo Farah wasn't knighted for his achievements this summer . Under the plans, ministers would get the . right to bypass the laborious selection process, where civil servants . weed out the nominees, and send their suggestions straight to the . relevant honours committee, which are now staffed by experts as well as . civil servants. If mandarins reject the suggestions . they will have to provide a full explanation in writing to the minister, . dissuading them from simply rewarding their own rather than people who . command public support. A senior Government source said: 'What . we've seen in recent years is a complete civil service takeover of the . honours system which have cut politicians out. It started as a reaction . to the Blair years but there is now a realisation that it has gone far . too far. 'We have replaced political control of . the honours system with control exercised by unelected and unaccountable . bureaucrats.' The plans for change have been fed into Sir Bob Kerslake, . the head of the civil service, is conducting 'quinquennial review' of . the system, which is due to be sent to Buckingham Palace for approval . this Spring. He has accepted that ministers have the . right to feedback but is resisting calls for them to bypass the civil . service bureaucracy on the grounds that this would politicise the . system. A civil service source defended the . mandarins, pointing out that honours for domestic civil servants and . quangocrats account for just one in 11 gongs. When diplomats and members . of the Armed Forces are thrown in, 18 per cent of honours go to public . servants. 'The vast majority are people who do charity or voluntary work, often in their local communities. 'We reject the criticism that the . government hand out gongs to people for long service. All honours are . given to people on their own individual merits. There is no rubber . stamping.' Plans for change have been passed to civil service chief Sir Bob Kerslake, who is conducting a review.","Anger in Number 10 over this year's honours list .

Unemployment has increased by 70,000 to 2.56million, with another rise in the number of young people out of work taking the figure 'dangerously close' to one million. The total is the worst since last summer, giving the UK a jobless rate of 7.9 per cent, with 979,000 16 to 25-year-olds seeking work. Martina Milburn, chief executive of The Prince's Trust, said: 'Youth unemployment is still dangerously close to a million. 'Thousands of these young people are . long-term unemployed, often facing further challenges such as poverty . and homelessness. We must act now to support these young people into . work and give them the chance of a better future.' Figures from the Office for National Statistics show unemployment has increased by 70,000 to 2.56 million . The number of people in work fell by . 2,000 in the latest quarter to February, to just under 30million - the . first time the figure has dipped since autumn 2011. Today's data from the Office for National Statistics revealed that 900,000 people have been out of work for more than a year, an 8,000 increase on the three months to November, while the number of unemployed 16 to 24-year-olds rose by 20,000. There was a 7,000 fall in Jobseeker's Allowance claimants last month, to 1.53 million. Meanwhile, the rise in average earnings continued to lag behind inflation, with total pay increasing by just 0.8 per cent in the year to February, down by 0.4 per cent on the previous month. Statisticians said it was the lowest growth rate since the end of 2009, while the 1 per cent rise in regular pay, which excludes bonuses, was the lowest since records began in 2001. The number of people classed as economically inactive, including students, people on long-term sick leave or those who have given up looking for work, fell by 57,000 to 8.95 million. Latest unemployment figures from the ONS show 7.9 per cent of the adult labour force cannot find a job . Despite today's increase in unemployment, the total is 71,000 lower than a year ago. There . has been a 62,000 fall in the number of people in part-time jobs, to . just over eight million, with a 60,000 increase in full-time employment, . to 21.6 million. Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Liam Byrne said: 'Three years on it's now clear the Government's plan is failing, and failing badly. Not only are more people unemployed than at the election, it's soaring up. 'Yet to add insult to injury this Government is slashing tax credits and child benefit but giving millionaires a tax cut. Families are £891 worse off because of tax and benefit changes and pay packets are now a whopping £1,700 smaller than at the last election. People have to work almost an extra month and a half to make what they did in 2010. Working people are going backwards. 'With the IMF warning George Osborne to change course and unemployment getting worse, it's clear the time has come for a fresh approach.' Figures show a rise of unemployment among young people and those out of work for more than a year . David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: 'The labour market figures are disappointing, but unsurprising. 'Despite the fairly large rise in unemployment, the number of those in jobs has remained almost unchanged. 'The level of inactivity fell by 57,000 in the three months to February as more people returned to the workforce, and this contributed to the increase in unemployment. Although the UK labour market remains surprisingly robust, overall the outlook is uncertain. 'It is realistic to expect further increases in the jobless total if the private sector is able to only absorb some of the expected reductions in public sector employment. In our recent forecast, we predicted that unemployment would increase to 2.6 million in 2014.' Nigel Meager, director of the Institute for Employment Studies, said: 'Today’s data from the Office of National Statistics show that the long-awaited recovery in the UK labour market may still be some way off. 'Nearly all the headline indicators recorded little change; the recent employment growth seems to have fizzled out, and there is virtually no change in total hours worked in the economy, or in new vacancies recorded by employers. 'Much recent commentary has focused on the apparent resilience of the UK labour market, and the strong performance in total employment. 'It’s worth stressing though that the employment rate at 71 per cent is still below its pre-recession level, and the recent jobs growth has been at the expense of a poor productivity performance, which may harm the UK’s longer-term growth prospects. 'Recent employment growth has relied heavily on under-employed part-timers, and precarious self-employment. 'Looking beyond these small month-to-month movements in the official statistics, the overall picture remains one of stagnation. 'Unemployment has been stuck at around 2.5 million for nearly four years, a million higher than pre-recession levels, and the employment rate has been stuck in the 70-71 per cent range for a similar period. 'The stark fact is that although the labour market wasn’t hit as badly this time round as in previous recessions, it has taken much longer to recover, and the light at the end of the tunnel remains rather dim.'","Data from the ONS reveals UK has jobless rate of 7.9 per cent .

The family of a man with Downs Syndrome who died in police custody are disappointed that a grand jury today declined to indict the three Maryland sheriff's deputies involved in his death, according to their lawyer. Baltimore attorney Sharon Krevor-Weisbaum represents the family of Robert Ethan Saylor, 26, of New Market, who died after being forcibly removed from a movie theater on January 12. Krevor-Weisbaum said on Friday that the family is also troubled that the Frederick County Sheriff's Office investigated its own officers. No charges: A grand jury ruled on Friday that the three Maryland sheriff's deputies involved in the death of Robert Saylor, left, at a Westview movie theater, right, will not face criminal charges . The attorney said that the family wants to review the investigative file and autopsy report before deciding how to proceed. The tragic incident happened while the off-duty deputies were trying to remove . Saylor from the Westview Cinema at the management's request. State's Attorney J. Charles Smith said that Lt. Scott Jewell, Sgt. Rich Rochford and Deputy First Class James Harris would not face criminal charges in Saylor's death. Saylor, who often went by his middle name Ethan, suffocated to death at the Westview Stadium 16 cinema in Frederick. The Frederick County Sheriff's Office says the deputies were moonlighting as mall security officers when they were called because Saylor refused to leave the theater. They found Saylor with a health aide refusing to leave the screen where they had been watching Zero Dark Thirty. Music-lover: Robert Saylor pictured with a relative was a big music fan and a member of his church choir . The agency says they handcuffed Saylor and forced him to the ground after he resisted arrest and cursed at them. Smith said at a news conference that . at no point during the brief encounter did the deputies use force at . Saylor's neck or above his shoulders. He said Saylor was handcuffed and on . his stomach for one to two minutes. Smith said that when Saylor began . showing signs of a medical emergency, the deputies removed the handcuffs . and administered CPR. Smith said the medical . examiner's report says Saylor died of asphyxia, with contributing . factors that included obesity and cardiovascular disease. He said the ME found that Saylor's health was compromised by physical conditions that made him more susceptible to sudden death. Smith called Saylor's death a 'tragic and untimely loss.' Patrick McAndrew, a lawyer for the . three officers, said 'each one of these deputies is the consummate law . enforcement professional' and did what his training dictated. In February the Baltimore County . Medical Examiner's office declared that 26-year-old Robert Saylor died . by homicide while being taken into custody by the three officers, ABC News reported. The New Market man, remembered for his love of music, was handcuffed and allegedly resisted arrest. According . to ABC it was alleged his face was put to the ground when he was being . apprehended by the officers, who then realized he was suffering a . 'medical emergency'. The officers removed the handcuffs, administered first aid and took him to Frederick Memorial Hospital where he later died. 'Asphyxiation': Robert Saylor, pictured, was taken to Frederick Memorial Hospital by police officers where he later died from his injuries . 'They made numerous attempts to get him to leave, he was cursing at them, at that point they psychically removed him, and he began having the medical emergency,' says Cpl. Jennifer Bailey, of the Frederick County Sheriff's Office told YourState4.com. 'They immediately removed the handcuffs and administered first aid. It's a very sad case, and not something we see everyday.' Saylor's mother, Patti Saylor, told the ABC her son should never have been arrested. 'He has never had anyone put their hands on him in their life,' says Patti Saylor. 'He would not have been doing anything threatening to anybody.' Saylor was said to be a 'cherished member of Damascus Road Community Church' where he was a member of the men’s choir.","Robert Saylor, 26, died while being arrested for refusing to leave Westview Cinemas, Frederick, Maryland, on January 12 .

Researchers have discovered red wood ants prefer to build their colonies along active faults, fractures where the Earth ruptures, in Germany. Gabriele Berberich, of the University of Duisburg-Essen, in Germany, said the behaviour of the ants significantly changed before an earthquake above magnitude 2.0 hit the area. Their behaviour did not return to normal until a day after the earthquake. Sense: Red wood ants (pictured) significantly change their behaviour before an earthquake, researchers have discovered . Colony: The researchers tracked the ants round the clock for three years between 2009 and 2012 . Berberich presented her research at the European Geosciences Union annual meeting, in Vienna, LiveScience has reported. Her team, who counted 15,000 ant mounds lining the active faults, tracked the ants round the clock for three years between 2009 and 2012. The team discovered the ants would undergo their usual activities during the day before retreating into their mound at night. But before an earthquake, the ants would stay awake and remained outside the mound during the night, leaving them vulnerable to predators. The research suggested the ants only changed their behaviour when the earthquake was over magnitude 2, which is the smallest earthquakes humans can feel. Berberich has suggested the insects are able to predict the earthquakes by picking up changing gas emissions or shifts in the Earth's magnetic field. Communication: Red wood ants, pictured here communicating by touching antennae, prefer to build their colonies along active faults, the team found . Damage: Buildings damaged by an earthquake in Mirandola, near Modena, in May last year . Berberich said: 'Red wood ants have chemo receptors for carbon dioxide gradients and magneto receptors for electromagnetic fields. 'We're not sure why or how they react to the possible stimuli, but we're planning on going to a more tectonically active region and see if ants react to larger earthquakes.' The Times of India has reported Berberich and her colleagues are hoping to continue their research in areas where larger earthquakes are more common.","Ants in Germany prefer to build their colonies along active faults .

John the elder stayed behind to watch over his house in Staten Island, New York, but his son refused to leave because he wanted to be by his side. The death means that John the elder's wife Christine has lost her husband, and her other two children Joseph, a twin of John junior, and Cali, 16, have lost a sibling and their father. The deaths were among the 19 fatalities on Staten Island due to Superstorm Sandy, more than any other borough in New York. The total U.S. death toll currently stands at 108. Among the other victims were Connor and Brandon Moore, four and two, who were swept out of mum Glenda's arms by a giant wave on the East coast of the island. John jr: Relatives said father and son had a special bond . The Filipowicz family live on Fox Beach Avenue which was among the hardest hit streets on Staten Island, where another 51-year-old unidentified man died. Neil Filipowicz, 46, John the elder's brother told MailOnline that his brother decided to ignore warnings to evacuate after the weathering hurricane Irene last year and a 1992 storm. The family today went to inspect the devastating scene where their loved ones had been killed. He said: 'I spoke to Joseph and he said that that day he tried to get him to leave. He was on the phone and was telling John (the son) to leave the house. He told him: 'I'm not leaving Daddy'. 'There was no way he was going to leave his dad at home. It was a bond how it's supposed to be with your kids, between a son and a father. They loved each other so much. They had an incredible bond.' Neil, a retired New York City Firefighter who served on 9/11, said the family became concerned when they were unable to reach either father or son during Monday night's storm. Neil went to their house the next day at 7.30am, had a look round the house and noticed his brother's keys and wallet were on the table but there was no sign of them. Neil, Christine and other relatives then went round local hostels and when they found nothing Neil went back to the house on his own. Neil said: 'I crawled through a hole in the wall that the water had made. I shone my flashlight from right to left and then I saw a hand, to my left. 'I was praying it was a doll's hand but I reached in the water and grabbed it and my nephew came up. 'My brother came up too, he had his arm round the back of his head, shielding him.

'My nephew was holding my brother and my brother was clutching him into his chest as if they knew they were dying. 'My brother was protecting him. Their eyes were open. My brother looked intense, like he was still trying to fight the end and be the father and protect his son. My nephew was so scared. 'The water line on this was 10ft up but I'm thinking it must have been much higher.' Neil said that the two men were in the basement because they were 'checking on things' – others on the street had narrow escapes when they did exactly the same. Neil said: 'I know my brother had some sandbags outside, he had used some expandable foam on the back door. No water got through it. 'All the foam had to be cut out, he probably was checking on it and maybe he heard a crack in the structure, but once that gave way, the rush of the water, that pressure. Some of the cinderblocks are over the other side of the basement. To be pushed like that, they shot like cannon.' Fighting back the tears, Neil said that he had been on duty as a New York City fireman on 9/11 but that 'nothing compares to this because of the closeness'. Neighbours knew John the elder as the 'mayor' of the street because he looked after them all by helping clean the snow out of the street in winter. John jr pictured with a friend . They in turn referred to him by the family nickname, 'Flip'. Paying tribute to his brother, Neil said: 'My brother was all about family. Even our friends were considered family, it was like an extended family. 'He was United States Marine out of High School. He served in Greneda then he worked in the New York City Corrections Department and from there he retired and worked for the Concrete Labourers Union for a while. 'He was a big family man, loved his wife and kids immensely. For the last few years he drove a bus for school kids. 'He was football coach, a basketball coach. He was school baseball coach as well and was a church going man, he was a regular at St Charles Catholic church' Neil described John the son as a 'prince' who did 'anything for anyone'. He said: 'He was the heir to who is father was. He did everything right. He was never in trouble, he did everything right. He was devoted to his girlfriend. He went to college and took the Fire Department test, he was trying to better himself and thinking about becoming a nurse.' Speaking to MailOnline outside her home, Christine wiped away the tears as she said that she had not fully accepted what had happened to her family. She said: 'I'm just being strong for my children. It's a shock, I'm going in and out. I'm just trying to hold it together. I have a very good family. 'John meant the world to me. 'He was my rock. He was my rock.

Gerald Howarth: The former defence minister said MPs must be allowed to debate the potential merger . The potential merger of BAE with Franco-German aviation giant EADS should be delayed so Parliament can discuss whether it is in the national interest, a former defence minister said yesterday. Gerald Howarth, who was minister for security strategy until last month’s reshuffle, said the Government must not allow Paris and Berlin to gain control of the UK’s biggest defence firm. BAE is in merger talks to gain a foothold in the European defence and civil aircraft markets. But MPs are concerned that the £30billion deal would hand France and Germany at least a 9 per cent share each in the new company. Mr Howarth said there were potential commercial advantages for BAE by diversifying outside the defence market. But he said MPs must be allowed to debate and block any attempt to create a merged company which would give foreign governments the power to close British defence plants and lay off British workers. The two companies are expected  to make a statement on their  plans to the stock market on October 10. Mr Howarth said: ‘There has to be an extension. It’s not acceptable that the Government could make decisions alone where there are 100,000 jobs at stake.’ He added: ‘Politically it will be unsellable to Parliament for the French and German governments to have a large stake in the new company. ‘We can’t possibly have a company, our major defence contractor, with those governments as its shareholders deciding where to invest its money.’ 'National interest': The Government must not allow Paris and Berlin to gain control of the UK's biggest defence firm, Mr Howarth said . The Government is locked in talks with the French, Germans and the two companies in a bid to limit the size of their share in the new company. Downing Street has been spooked by proposals to let the French and German governments acquire further shares in the future. EADS chief executive Tom Enders sought to reassure critics concerned about the potential for large redundancies by saying the deal was not about ‘slashing thousands of jobs’. Showbiz roundup!

The deaths of Matthew Van Waus, 38, and his wife Leah, 31, have shocked the tight-knit community of Victor, Iowa, after their bodies were discovered by police after 6am on the morning of Friday 11 May. Although the couple were married for seven-and-a-half years the families have separated them. The mother of Leah Van Waus spoke out for the first time about the terrible ordeal, telling MailOnline: 'We just feel fortunate that we were able to bring Leah home to celebrate her life. It's still very much a shock. 'The saddest deaths are untimely deaths. This is a loss for our family.' Mrs Olsen said their deaths came as a complete surprise. 'It's the loss of the promise of the future and the companionship and joy she brought us in the present,' she said. Mrs Van Waus will be buried separately from her husband, causing speculation of a rift between the families. 'Sometimes families don't get along,' an employee at the funeral home that arranged Mr Van Waus's funeral said. 'Her family stepped in and took her.' Mrs Olsen refuted the sentiment, saying if there was an issue between the two families, she didn't know anything about it.

Plea: Gary McKinnon and his mother Janice Sharp are campaigning against his extradition . Mr McKinnon said he was searching for evidence of 'little green men' when he hacked into Nasa and Pentagon computers from his bedroom in north London. MPs were today debating whether the Government's treaty allowing fast-tracking of suspects to America needs reform to 'strengthen the protection of British citizens'. Mr Blunkett told the BBC there was 'no substantial difference' between how each country's citizens are treated and said there was 'no way the US is going to renegotiate the treaty'. But he told the BBC it was more important to find out 'whether it is possible, using modern technology and video conferencing for the trial to take place on US soil, but for Gary to remain in Britain and for him to serve his sentence here'. Conservative backbencher Dominic Raab, who pushed for today's debate said: 'No one wants to scrap extradition. What we want is a bit of common sense and some safeguards for our citizens.' The mother of Gary McKinnon today begs MPs to stand up for Britain by voting to change the unfair extradition laws. Plea: Former Labour home secretary David Blunkett has made two trips to Washington to argue the case of alleged hacker Gary McKinnon . In an impassioned open letter in the Mail, Janis Sharp tells politicians taking part in tonight's crunch debate that the lopsided rules are causing 'terror without end'. Urging them to vote in favour of changing the UK/U.S. extradition treaty, she adds: 'We're counting on you – don't let us down.' There is huge back-bench support from all parties ahead of the landmark vote calling for reforms to the treaty – which gives U.S. citizens far greater protection than their British counterparts. Supporters of Mr McKinnon, who has Asperger's syndrome, include London Mayor Boris Johnson, celebrities and civil liberties groups. But campaigners need a huge turnout in the debate if they are to claim success. Rumours continue to swirl that Downing Street – under huge pressure from the U.S. Embassy – might attempt a secret operation to prevent the motion being passed. Officially, Number Ten says it is relaxed about the outcome and that MPs can vote with their conscience. But ministers and their aides – including supporters of Mr McKinnon – have been quietly tapped on the shoulder and instructed to vote against the motion. It is hoped that a large turnout of Tory, Lib Dem and Labour MPs in the Commons will scare them off trying to sabotage the vote. The case of 45-year-old Mr McKinnon, who was arrested a decade ago on allegations of hacking into Nasa and Pentagon computers while searching for evidence of 'little green men' from his north London home, has highlighted the unfairness of the 2003 treaty. Adamant: American Ambassador Louis Susman is putting huge pressure on Downing Street to extradite Mr McKinnon . Tory MP Dominic Raab, who will lead today's debate, has uncovered figures showing that, between 2004 and July 2011, 123 people of all nationalities were extradited from  Britain to the U.S. During the same period, only 54 travelled in the opposite direction. Last week, the U.S. Ambassador Louis Susman made two extraordinary visits to the Commons to defend the Act – leading to claims he was 'strong-arming' elected MPs. Mr Susman, in a letter to the Mail, made clear that his country will not voluntarily agree to any changes to the treaty, which he continues to insist is fair. Under the Act, if the U.S. government want to extradite a UK citizen it needs only to outline the alleged offence, the punishment specified by statute and provide an accurate description of the suspect. The test is known as 'reasonable suspicion'. But to extradite an American from the States, Britain must prove 'probable cause' – which the U.S. constitution defines as 'information sufficient to warrant a prudent person's belief that the wanted individual has committed a crime'. The ambassador claims: 'There may be some confusion because the standards of  evidence for extradition under the treaty are different in terminology.  But in practice, “probable cause” and “reasonable suspicion” are the same. Both are the tests that police officers in our respective countries must meet to justify an arrest.' Mr Susman continues: 'The United States never wants to be unfair to UK citizens. We merely want the interests of justice served.' Tonight's vote, which already has the backing of 50 backbenchers, calls for changes to the controversial European Arrest Warrant, as well as UK/U.S. laws. It gives Tory MPs a  chance to demand the return of powers from Brussels. The motion was jointly proposed by Mr Raab, ex-Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Campbell and Keith Vaz, Labour chairman of the home affairs select committee. Tory David Davis said: 'It is plain that the last government in the rush to appease both the U.S. and Europeans over extradition created an engine for injustice which many innocent people are  suffering from today.' By JANIS SHARP . Gary McKinnon's mother Janis Sharp has begged MPs to stop her son being extradited . Our MPs must support this motion as no one else should ever be subjected to a decade of mental torture as my son Gary has. This is not a party political issue. Every British politician's first duty is to British people rather than to any foreign nation. Yet pressure is being applied by the U.S. Ambassador and the U.S. Attorney General for MPs to vote against. Such coercion is a wholly inappropriate interference in Britain's affairs and the U.S. would not take kindly to such meddling by the UK, were the roles reversed. Extradition was meant to bring someone back to a country they had fled from after committing a heinous crime but British pensioners, students and computer geeks with autism are being targeted by America even when never having set foot there. The U.S. are abusing the treaty simply because they can, since our safeguards were shockingly dispensed with. Gary embarrassed the U.S. by highlighting their cyber security as pitiful, as they had no passwords or firewalls on their computers. He could have paid for his foolishness years ago had he been prosecuted in the UK as others have. When Gary rang me in 2002 to say he had been arrested, my heart sank when discovering he'd been interviewed by the police with no lawyer. A suggested six-month community service sentence by UK police quickly turned into a maximum 60-year sentence once America took over. We might speak a similar language but our sense of justice is poles apart. Seeing the deterioration in Gary's mental health breaks my heart. His intelligent and curious mind and spirit has been broken and for what? American and British authorities left Gary on the internet for three and a half years after his arrest, proving they knew he was no threat. Gary is gentle to the core but has lost ten years of his youth and now sits in darkness with no respite from what is psychological torture. Every day for ten excruciating years we have lived in a constant state of terror seemingly without end. I occasionally foster siblings when police emergencies crop up. I'm sitting here with a ten-week-old baby brought to my door when their mother was rushed to hospital. Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown (left) visited U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton (right) in a bid to free Mr McKinnon . Looking down at him reminds me of when Gary was a baby. He was safe in my arms and no one could hurt him and I knew I would protect him with my life. With his mop of auburn hair, green eyes and elfin face he was different. As a toddler he used to ask me about the stars and the planets and when the world was going to end. Gary has Asperger's Syndrome and wants to save our planet but unfortunately his obsession with the stars has resulted in his life being destroyed. There are times when floods of tears well up and I'm overwhelmed by emotion. I remember arriving in London with Gary when he was six years old and I wish I was somehow able to go back in time and to change everything and that Gary had invented a time machine. Since his arrest our lives have changed completely. We were forced to sell our home and every waking moment is spent campaigning for Gary. I'm driven to fight constantly for my son's life and sleep has become a luxury as my mind is on overdrive thinking of what else I can do to stop him from being dragged thousands of miles from his family, to a foreign land. In despicable online child pornography cases, America prosecutes in the location of the keyboard. Why then is that principle not appropriate for someone like Gary who was searching for information on UFOs and Free Energy? So try Gary, and others like him, in the UK. David Cameron twice went to President Obama to ask for Gary to be to be tried in the UK. Gordon Brown went to Hillary Clinton and the U.S. Ambassador to plead for Gary. However America chose to snub these requests which our leaders would never have done had the boot been on the other foot. So David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg, please unite on this matter of principle and don't be swayed by America's tantrums but instead allow a truly free vote today for all MPs. Our government also must honour their pre-election promises as British rights and British lives are at stake. A vote against Dominic Raab, Sir Menzies Campbell and Keith Vaz's cross-party motion to strengthen and restore our safeguards would be a gross betrayal of all British citizens.

"By . Becky Barrow . PUBLISHED: . 19:05 EST, 6 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 23:54 EST, 6 November 2012 . Women in high-flying jobs earn almost half a million pounds less in their lives than men with identical careers, a damning report reveals today. They are also less likely to get a bonus and more likely to be made redundant. If they do receive a bonus, it is typically half the amount paid to a man doing exactly the same job. Separate studies have shown that businesses in the UK are 'spectacularly unsuccessful' at promoting high-flying women . Experts yesterday insisted the gulf in earnings was impossible to justify and described the gender pay gap as ‘disturbing’. The research from the Chartered Management Institute is based on the experiences of nearly 39,000 British executives. It said that although the number of women working in senior positions at FTSE 100 companies is rising, it remains low, at 17.3 per cent. Separate studies have shown that businesses in the UK are ‘spectacularly unsuccessful’ at promoting high-flying women. The latest research takes the example of a man and a woman who start at the bottom of the executive career ladder at the age of 25, win equal promotions and retire at 60. Professor Cary Cooper says many women are blighted by a lack of confidence . During their 35-year careers, the woman will earn £1.09million but the man will earn £1.52million. The report stresses that the gender pay gap does not fully develop until women are in their thirties. In their twenties, male and female . executives tend to earn roughly the same salary, with both being paid an . average of around £23,000. But the gap gets wider as they get older, with many women penalised for taking short career breaks to have children. The . CMI said a typical male management executive earns a basic salary of . £40,325, but a woman in the same job earns £30,265. While a typical man . can scoop an average bonus of around £7,500, his female colleague . typically will receive only £3,730, and the picture gets worse as women . get older. After rising from a junior executive . to a director half of all men receive a  bonus, compared with little . more than a third of women. Over . the last year, the report found that 4.3 per cent of female executives . were made redundant, compared with only 3.2 per cent of male executives. Dawn Nicholson, a partner at accountants Pricewaterhouse Coopers, said: ‘The size of the lifetime earnings gap between men and women is disturbing. ‘It suggests that women are going backwards versus their male counterparts. If the career path is identical, then it is hard to see why the differential would exist, let alone how it could be justified. ‘Employers must really ask themselves whether they are being absolutely unbiased in the pay decisions they make.’ Many working women are penalised after taking maternity leave. The penalties range from missing out on pay rises while at home with their babies to being taken less seriously on their return to work because they work flexibly. Many women are penalised for taking short career breaks to have children . Many mothers who leave at 5pm every day, or take extra leave during the school holidays, say they feel less confident asking for pay rises or bonuses, or get overlooked for promotions. Others also find it more difficult to move jobs after having children which means they do not get the pay rises that typically come with switching employers. Professor Cary Cooper, from the Lancaster University Management School, said many women are also blighted by a lack of confidence. He said: ‘Men will ask for a promotion or a pay rise, which women are less likely to do. Men will let everybody know about their success whereas women will not let anybody know, but will hope the boss will recognise when they make a contribution.’ As many women may leave earlier in the evening to get back for their children, many feel ‘guilty’, which makes them reluctant to ask for a pay rise, he said. Ann Francke, chief executive of the CMI, said Britain needs ‘immediate’ action to ‘set things straight.’ She added: ‘The Government should demand more transparency from companies on pay, naming and shaming organisations that are perpetuating inequality.’ Kate Green MP, Labour’s equalities spokesman, said: ‘The gender pay gap at the management level is higher now than it was in 2010, and at this rate, 42 years after the Equal Pay Act was passed, it will take at least another 21 years for management level pay amongst men and women to be equalised. ‘This is simply not good enough.’","Studies show UK businesses 'spectacularly unsuccessful' at promoting high-flying women .

"By . Becky Barrow, Business Correspondent . UPDATED: . 12:22 EST, 25 November 2011 . Air passengers have been warned they could be held on planes for up to 12 hours and face mass flight cancellations due to next week’s public sector strikes. BAA, the owner of Heathrow airport, has told airlines to fly planes half full to help ease the chaos expected when immigration officers walk out. The warning comes as union bosses said they have amassed a fighting fund of tens of millions of pounds to bring the country to its knees with months of strikes – beginning on Wednesday. Unrest: The public sector pensions strike next week could go on for months, leaving the country in chaos . Travel hell: Air passengers can expect severe delays from next week with Heathrow airport advising airlines to fly planes half full in a bid to ease congestion at airport arrivals . Earlier this week, the Government said that civil servants and other inexperienced workers would be used to man the country's ports and airports when immigration staff walk out. Labour MP Keith Vaz warned that the last-minute drafting in of untrained staff at border control points was 'not a rigorous contingency plan'. Heathrow’s operating . officer Normand Boivin added: ‘There are likely to be very long delays of up to 12 . hours to arriving passengers. 'The delays at immigration are likely to . be so long that passengers could not be safely accommodated within the . terminals and would need to be held on arriving aircraft. ‘This in turn would quickly create . gridlock at the airport with no available aircraft parking stands, mass . cancellations or departing aircraft and diversions outside the UK for . arriving aircraft.’ The rolling programme of public sector strikes will begin with . Wednesday’s walkout, set to be the biggest since the General Strike of . 1926. But union barons said it was fantasy to think it would be a . one-off. Paul Kenny, general secretary of the GMB, said the strikes would continue into 2012 in the bitter dispute over pensions. Despairing: Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander said the last thing the economy needed was a 'self-inflicted wound' ‘It is Alice in Wonderland stuff to think that 30 November will happen, . people will stop work, take part in rallies, go home and say: “That was . all right. Now we can give in”. It is just nonsense.’ The GMB has a war chest of ‘tens of millions of pounds’, he said, which . can be used to help individual strikers or smaller unions. He expects . 1.5million to two million public sector workers to walk out on . Wednesday. The list includes teachers, nurses, paramedics, bin men, top civil servants, lollipop ladies and tax inspectors. Most schools will be closed, operations will be cancelled and the elderly may go unfed in hospitals. Mr Kenny said: ‘The overwhelming number of people will not get their bins emptied on Wednesday.’ In an unexpected perk, he said many motorists will be able to park for . free because GMB members include traffic wardens and operators of . municipal car parks. Unison, the country’s biggest health union, warned last night the Health Service will run only a ‘Christmas Day type’ rota. Of 1.56million NHS staff, around 450,000 are members of Unison, doing a . variety of jobs from paramedics to nurses, hospital porters to . healthcare assistants. It is feared that more than £500million in output will be lost and jobs . could be axed at a time when unemployment is at a 17-year high of . 2.6million. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said . during a visit to Leeds today: 'Clearly we're going to do everything we . can - notwithstanding the terrible disruption and, frankly, cost to the . economy these strikes will create - to make sure that systems, . including our borders are properly policed and properly controlled. 'But my message to the trade union . bosses who are corralling their members into conflict is: let the . teachers and the nurses and the doctors, and so on, let everybody take a . bit of time to look at the information that we've provided on our . Government website so people can look for themselves at what we're . offering. 'Actually what we're offering is reasonable and generous. 'We're saying all your pension . entitlements you've got until now will be protected; if you're going to . retire within 10 years there will be no change; if you're on a low or . middle income your pension will be the same, if not better than it was . before. 'I think the trade union bosses are . really doing a disservice - obviously to the public - but also to their . own members by not allowing their members to make up their own minds . based on the information that we're providing in our reasonable offer . from the Government.' Twenty-nine unions are taking part in Wednesday’s walkout following a . ballot of 2.6million members. As few as 800,000 voted for action and . turnout for Unison was only 29 per cent. Only the Association of . Professional Ambulance Personnel, with 1,240 NHS paramedics, voted . against strikes. Ian Boothman, the ballot organiser, said: ‘It reflects both the . dedication of our members and the difficulties they have with the . concept of withdrawing the 999 service from the public.’ Ministers said it was wrong to strike over pensions that were much more . generous than those in the private sector. The public sector pensions . bill is around £32billion a year, with workers contributing £5.5billion a . year and the rest paid by the taxpayer. The Government wants public workers to pay more into their pension, get a lower payout and retire at a later age. But earlier this month, ministers made a major concession to protect those within ten years of retirement. Workers who walk out on Wednesday will not be paid, unless they are in particular hardship. On the Heathrow disruption, the UKBA said: ‘The security of the UK . border remains our top priority and it is absolutely right we explore . all options to ensure we minimise any disruption caused by planned union . action.’ Cabinet Secretary Francis Maude has warned that the mass walkout may prompt radical changes to strike laws. ‘If strikes are called on the basis . of these very low turnouts then [the people who are calling for change] . will feel their case is strengthened,’ he said. Katja Hall, from the Confederation of British Industry, said: ‘What’s . particularly disappointing is that some of the largest unions have not . managed to achieve a clear mandate for a strike, and schools may be . forced to close despite only a handful of teachers voting for it.’ A Virgin Atlantic spokeswoman said: 'We are very concerned about the effect next week's strike will have on passengers and airport operators. Britain cannot afford to be closed for business. 'To reduce the number of passengers coming into UK airports and to minimise disruption to our passengers, we will allow those booked on inbound travel on November 30 to rebook for travel up to four days earlier or later without charge. 'Along with airport operators, other airlines and the wider aviation industry, we are continuing discussions with the Government and the UK Border Agency (UKBA) about possible contingencies.' British Airways said: 'We are concerned that the UKBA strike on November 30 creates considerable uncertainty for our customers booked to fly into UK airports on that day. 'We understand that there will be a significant risk of severe delays in passing through passport control, with potential knock-on effects on wider airport operations. 'We are doing everything that we can to protect our customers and continue to liaise closely with Government, UKBA and airport authorities about possible contingencies.'","Airport asks airlines to fly planes half full in bid to avert chaos .

Fragments of DNA from two unidentified people were found on the bag holding the body of MI6 spy Gareth Williams. The traces were discovered during a . search in which ‘almost everything conceivable’ was done to find out if . anyone else had been in the flat where his body was found. But a forensic expert admitted neither is likely to lead to a suspect because they contain partial and common fragments of DNA. Mystery: The body of spy Gareth Williams was found in a bag in his bathroom in Pimlico in August 2010 . Scotland Yard detectives are now pinning their hopes on tests on a green hand towel recovered from the secret agent’s kitchen. Ros Hammond, of LGC Forensics, said: . ‘There is hope. Tests are still in progress and there may be some . promising results . . . within a matter of weeks.’ Her findings will be . seized upon by detectives desperate to identify a third party who they . believe padlocked Mr Williams, 31, in the holdall. The naked and decomposing body of the . code-breaker was found a week later in the bath of his flat in Pimlico, . London, on August 23, 2010. The latest evidence came as the inquest into his mysterious death entered its final stages at Westminster Coroner’s Court. Experts said that despite being young . and fit, Mr Williams would have succumbed to the ‘soporific’ effect of . carbon dioxide poisoning ‘within two to three minutes’ of being zipped . inside the North Face holdall. Three pathologists agreed he either . suffocated or was killed by a mystery poison that cannot be detected . because it disappeared during decomposition. Summing up the forensic evidence found . in Mr Williams’s home, Mrs Hammond said the first trace of unidentified . DNA, from the handle of the bag, may belong to a police forensic . scientist who also left a trace on the dead man’s hand. The second, recovered from the . padlock, is likely to be old and contained a fragment of DNA found in . half the British population. Mrs Hammond said there was no evidence . that DNA had been cleaned from the flat, but admitted a third party . could have avoided leaving traces by wearing protective clothing and . gloves. Mystery: Mr Williams was found dead locked . inside a holdall in the bath of his flat . Pathologist Dr Ian Calder said Mr Williams probably died from hypocapnia, a fatal accumulation of carbon dioxide in the blood. He said the spy may have had no time . to realise he was in danger before being overwhelmed by the gas as it . built up in the bag with every breath. Another pathologist, Dr Richard . Shepherd, said the spy must have got into the bag himself as it would be . ‘extremely difficult’ to place a ‘floppy’ dead body in such a neat . position. He said there was no evidence Mr Williams was manhandled but conceded he could have been sedated or forced inside at gunpoint. The second week of the inquest into . Mr Williams’ baffling death heard evidence from three pathologists who . examined his body in minute detail. The hearing was also told that DNA was 'at least' two other people was found in the flat where the MI6 officer was found dead. At home: The lounge of Mr Williams' flat in Pimlico, London . They . found few clues as to what happened in the final moments of his life . which led to his body being found in a padlocked North Face holdall in . his bath. But they agreed . that the high-flying code-breaker either died from some form of . suffocation or was killed with an undetected poison. Coroner . Dr Fiona Wilcox was told that decomposition, accelerated by his . position in the bag during a hot summer month in his heated flat, . hindered their investigations. The dead man’s MI6 boss has been criticised for failing to act decisively until seven days after he failed to turn up for work. Dr . Calder said carbon dioxide can cause ‘havoc with the chemistry of the . body’ as it leaves the victim confused and unable to act. The . results, known as hypocapnia, would include headaches, then confusion . and eventually unconsciousness and cardiac arrest, the inquest heard. Dr Shepherd said the spy got into the . bag himself as it would be ‘extremely difficult’ to place a ‘floppy’ dead body in such a neat position. He said there is no evidence Mr Williams was manhandled but conceded he could have been sedated or forced inside at gunpoint. He said: ‘I think it would have been a very difficult process to achieve, getting a body so neatly into a bag. Were he to be alive and struggling I would anticipate there to have been injuries.’ Speaking about carbon dioxide poisoning, he added: ‘There may have been a period of awareness but it may have been short and rapidly contradicted by his decreasing ability to escape.’ Asked about how he may have died in the bag, Dr Shepherd said a struggle for fresh air would have been a ‘strong driver’ for an attempt to escape. But he added: ‘There would have been a time when he was aware, it is possible. But carbon dioxide poisoning can cause confusion very quickly.’ Suspicions: Mr Williams' body is taken out of . his flat. Relatives believe a third party was either present when Gareth . Williams died or broke into his home afterwards to destroy evidence . Forensic scientist Ros Hammond said there was DNA detected on the bag and handles which did not come from Mr Williams but there was 'no complete indication from one individual.' She said it involved 'complex mixtures' and that it was 'not always possible to unravel the mixture and identify the individual', meaning they are 'unconfirmed components.' She also said DNA found on the bag could have been deposited years ago and said there were no samples consistent with his work colleagues - samples were obtained from 15 anonymous colleagues - being in the flat. The inquest heard Mr Wiliams had several small grazes on his arms which could be consistent with an attempt to open the bag, but not a panicked escape attempt. Mystery: The spy's body was found inside the bag, padlocked from the outside . Unsolved: The inquest has heard that . whether Mr Williams was alive inside the North Face bag like this one . and locked it himself 'was at the very heart of this inquiry' Dr Benjamin Swift said the cause of Mr Williams’ death was ‘unascertained’ but that poisoning or asphyxiation were ‘probably rather than possibly’ to blame. He said the badly-decomposed condition of the body indicated the spy probably died shortly after he was last seen alive on August 15. The inquest had heard how it would have been almost impossible for Mr Williams to lock himself inside the bag with a small brass travel padlock. Two experts tried more than 400 times to seal themselves inside an identical bag but were unable to do so, saying escapologist ‘Houdini would struggle’. The detective responsible for the investigation has said she is convinced a third party must have been involved in his death or a cover up. Fragments of unidentifiable DNA were found on the zip but there are no other traces of anybody else in his flat. The inquest is expected to conclude tomorrow.

At 17 she ditched her waitressing job in Ilkeston, Derbyshire to become a full-time impersonator – and the gamble paid off. Her earnings allowed her to buy her first house at 19, and a second three years later. She has spent £30,000 on a fleet of sports cars including an Audi TT, a Mercedes SLK and a Toyota MR2. Scroll down for video . Michaela Weeks, 25 swapped serving tables for a hugely successful career as a Britney Spears lookalike . Michaela has pocketed a staggering £300,000 as a full time doppelganger due to her incredible likeness to the pop princess . Michaela, left in the classic red leather cat suit Britney wore in the Oops... I did it again video (right), can charge up £3,500 for a single appearance as the star . Michaela, who can charge up to £3,500 for a personal appearance, said: 'I feel very blessed to look like Britney and to be living the life I am now. I bought my first house at the age of 19 when most people my age were living with their parents, working in TopShop and still going to college. 'The best part is that I'm a huge Britney fan - it would be awful if I had to impersonate someone I hated. If I ever get to meet her I just want to thank her for giving me this life and for looking so much like me.' She bought her first house aged just 19 with partner mechanic Craig Warrington, 28, for £115,000 and three years later they bought their second home for £150,000. Michaela considers herself 'Lucky' that her resemblance to Britney has seen her travel the world on assignments. She has starred in a Kaiser Chiefs video and even posed for renowned celebrity spoof photographer Alison Jackson. Michaela bears a striking resemblance to the young pop star in the school girl outfit from Britney's debut single 'Hit me baby one more time' Over the years she has earned £300,000 impersonating the star. But life was very different for Michaela before, who worked in her local cafe in Ilkeston in Derbyshire for two years until she was 17. Wiping down tables and serving customers was her daily routine but now she belts out hits in front of thousands of screaming fans across the world. Uncanny resemblance: Britney wore a ringmaster outfit for her Circus tour (left): Michaela's career has enabled her to live a luxury lifestyle and she owns several luxury cars as well as two houses . Michaela considers herself 'Lucky' that her resemblance to Britney has seen her travel the world on assignments . Britney Spears caused a sensation when she appeared in her Toxic music video as a sexy air hostess . Michaela bought her first house at the age of 19 with her partner for £115,000 and three years later they bought their second home for £150,000 . She first realised her striking resemblance to the pop icon when Britney burst onto the music scene with Baby One More Time in 1998. Over time the catcalls of 'hit me one more time' and 'Hey, it's Britney!' from passersby in the street became more frequent and Michaela eventually entered a lookalike competition for Granada TV at the age of 16. Incredibly she failed to make the cut but the following year she was called back on the show, called Stars and Their Doubles, and won her category. Michaela, here in the infamous catsuit from Britney's Toxic video has featured in a Kaiser Chiefs music video and been photographed by reknowned lookalike photographer Alison Jackson . Michaela owns a copy of the nude jeweled bodysuit Britney wore in her Toxic video . Michaela said: 'I tried a bit of modelling after that but every time I tried to do something different people kept coming back to the Britney thing. 'In the end the pull was so strong I packed in my waitressing job and decided to give it a go full-time and I haven't looked back since.' From there, work as a Britney lookalike started flooding in and Michaela began putting together a tribute act with the help of a vocal coach and choreographer. But it has not all been plain sailing for the Spears lookalike. Michaela nearly lost her home when Britney suffered her much publicised breakdown in 2007. Michaela relaxes, enjoying her luxury lifestyle, in her hot tub in the sexy outfit worn by Britney in her 'I'm a slave for you' music video . Michaela first noticed her resemblance to Britney (left) when she was 16 but it was after pursuing modelling for a while that people really convinced her she looked like the popstar . Michaela's success means her day-to-day life now is a far cry from her old life where she worked as a waitress .

I struggled to get regular work with the recession, and ended up working for agencies and doing odd jobs to try and keep up with the bills. 'The only proper job I'd ever had was being Britney and although I had a beauty qualification I had never put it to any use. I had nothing to fall back on.

"By . James Salmon . Created 11:05 AM on 5th December 2011 . UPDATED: . 08:04 EST, 5 March 2012 . Giant fine: HSBC has been fined £10.5 million by the FSA for giving 'inappropriate investment advice' to elderly customers . Thousands of frail elderly people struggling to pay care-home fees were lured into gambling their life savings on risky investments. The ‘serious and systemic’ scandal went unnoticed for an astonishing two decades. It came to light yesterday as HSBC, Britain’s biggest bank, was fined a record £10.5million and ordered to repay £29.3million to vulnerable savers it had misled. There are fears that thousands more pensioners could have fallen victim to the banking industry’s latest mis-selling scandal. Salesmen working for the Nursing Home Fees Agency (NHFA), a subsidiary of the bank since 2005, persuaded people as old as 94 to bet their nest-eggs on stock-market schemes which many would never live to see pay out. Incredibly, leading charities including Help the Aged and the Royal British Legion and even the Government’s own advice website might have pointed elderly people in the direction of rogue investment advisers. Some of their victims were even targeted in their care homes and persuaded to hand over an average of £115,000 – often the proceeds from the sale of the family home. As a damning report from the Financial Services Authority concluded that nine out of the ten sales were mis-sold, it also emerged that: . Help the Aged was paid commission for passing on names to the NHFA while the Royal British Legion listed the firm as a place to seek advice on how to pay care fees; . Dr Ros Altmann, director general of the over-50s organisation Saga, said: ‘How many times do banks have to be hauled over the coals for behaving inappropriately before they improve? This disgusting behaviour takes the banks’ reputation to a new low and will make it difficult for consumers to ever trust them.’ The FSA report revealed how, between . July 2005 and 2010, NHFA mis-sold investments to 2,485 customers who . were persuaded to put their life savings in the stock market – typically . via investment bonds. The . victims had turned to NHFA for sound advice on paying care-home fees. But of the cases investigated, nine out of every ten sales were . unsuitable. Salesmen routinely locked up their money for five years by effectively banning withdrawals, despite many of the victims having not long to live. In other cases the salesmen, who earned handsome commission payments for every bond they sold, left savers with only enough cash to pay for one year’s nursing-home fees. This meant that when they ran out of money they would have to take money out of their investment – incurring strict penalties. In some cases families lost their inheritance after being forced to pay these fines when their loved one died. The products were sold to elderly individuals entering, or already in, long-term care and in many cases these elderly customers were reliant on the investments to pay for their care. (Posed by models) The salesmen broke not just one, but three of the most basic rules of investment advice: Don’t lock up your customers’ money if they are going to need it. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. And don’t take more risk as the customer grows older – take less. The FSA report says: ‘Failings in the suitability of advice were serious, systemic and persisted over a long period.’ Its investigation covered the five years when NHFA was owned by HSBC, Britain’s most profitable bank, which made £7billion in the first half of 2011. Although it was HSBC which raised concerns with the FSA, it took the bank four years to spot the problems. NHFA was closed in July this year. Huge sum: The Financial Services Authority estimates NHFA customers will be paid a total of £29.5 million in compensation . Experts fear this could be the tip of the iceberg as NHFA was the biggest financial adviser specialising in helping those going into care in the UK, with a 60 per cent share of the market. It had been giving advice on care-home fees since 1991. Marc Gander, founder of Consumer Action Group, said: ‘This could have been going on for decades. This systematic mugging of older people, with the unwitting help of charities like Help the Aged and even the Government, has to stop. ‘This is a disgusting betrayal of an enormous number of trusting elderly customers nearing the end of their lives. 'It undermines any remaining confidence in the banking industry and will set alarm bells ringing for anyone with an elderly parent or grandparent who has gone to their bank for advice.’ Age UK, Britain’s biggest charity for older people, had close ties with NHFA during the height of the mis-selling. Salesmen at NHFA would set up meetings with care-home residents and their families, often after receiving a tip-off from charities such as Help the Aged – now part of Age UK – the Royal British Legion and the Government’s financial advice website Direct.gov.uk. Between 2003 and 2009, Help the Aged referred anyone wanting advice on funding care-home fees to NHFA, receiving a payment for each case. An Age UK spokesman said: ‘Help the Aged did not advise potential customers or have any input in investment decisions. 'The contract was reviewed as part of the Age UK merger process and it was decided to terminate the contract.’ The scandal comes after a series of revelations which have shattered confidence in the UK’s High Street giants. In January Barclays was fined £7.7million and ordered to pay £60million compensation to thousands of elderly customers missold risky investments. 'I fully accept that NHFA failed to give suitable financial advice to some of their customers. This should not have happened and I am profoundly sorry that it did' In April the banks lost a High Court case over the misselling of rip-off payment protection insurance and were forced to set aside billions in compensation. And in May, Bank of Scotland – part of Lloyds Banking Group – was fined £3.5million and forced to pay £17million compensation after being found guilty of mishandling complaints from elderly customers missold risky investments. Tracey McDermott, acting director of enforcement and financial crime at the FSA, said: ‘NHFA was trusted by its vulnerable and elderly customers. It breached that trust to sell them unsuitable products.’ Brian Robertson, HSBC chief executive, said: ‘I fully accept that NHFA failed to give suitable financial advice to some of their customers. This should not have happened and I am profoundly sorry that it did. ‘We have high values here at HSBC and this runs contrary to everything that we stand for. ‘We are undertaking a full review and I can guarantee that every customer found to have not been treated fairly will not be disadvantaged.’ Who does this impact?The FSA has said that 2,485 people were advised by NHFA to invest in bond products as a means to fund their long-term care. The investment bonds were designed to grow capital but also generate income to cover care costs. Most victims were elderly and the FSA said their average age was 83. What went wrong?NHFA 'advisers' told clients to put their savings into bonds that invested in stocks and shares and that tied their money up for a fixed period, typically five years. Problems arose because clients often had a life expectancy shorter than the term of the bond. In order not to lose their money on death, they had to withdraw cash before the bond matured and thereby suffered withdrawal penalties. What should have happened?NHFA sales staff should have advised clients that the product would only work if they survived the whole investment period. Advisers should have first recommended no-risk, tax-efficient savings products, such as ISAs, which would have been cheaper and safer. The FSA said a shocking 87 per cent of sales were inappropriate. How much money did victims lose? The average investment in the bonds was around £115,000 and the average loss arising from the bad advice was £11,790. HSBC has to pay £29.3million in compensation on top of a £10.5million fine. How much did the advisers get? Advisers received commission for selling the investment bonds. HSBC said . that it was typical for NHFA advisers to be paid 5 per cent of the . investment amount up front and then a further 1 per cent each year. Based on the average investment, NHFA advisers would have received . £5,750 for selling the investment product, and then a further £1,150 . each year. A five-year investment bond would have netted advisers . £11,500. Why is HSBC paying the fine?HSBC has owned NHFA since 2005. It was an HSBC audit of sales that flagged up the problems at NHFA. The bank closed NHFA in July this year after the mis-selling came to light. What do victims need to do?HSBC has said that those who have been mis-sold will be contacted in the coming weeks and do not have to do anything until then. Given the fact that many of the victims are very elderly, the bank has promised to deliver compensation quickly. How can I get safe advice about funding long-term care?It is important to get advice from an Independent Financial Adviser that is not tied to any one, or group of, product providers. Advisers can only call themselves 'independent' if they are not tied in this way. Additionally, paying via an upfront fee for the advice you get, rather than letting the adviser collect a commission from the company that provides with the product, is more likely to secure impartial advice.","FSA said bank's NHFA subsidiary 'inappropriately' advised 2,485 customers to invest in .

Mrs VanLeeuwen told KFSN that she received a frantic call from Martzen, then 19, in February 2009 and raced to her home in Reedley, where she found her daughter in a frightening condition.

Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone could be prosecuted after a top banker today admitted taking a £28million 'bribe' from him for selling the racing business to the ‘right bidder’. German prosecutors are mulling over whether to press charges on Ecclestone who last appeared in the trial of Gerhard Gribkowsky as a witness last year. Gribkowsky told Munich’s higher regional court today that the charges against him were 'essentially true', breaking eight months of silence. Claims: Former BayernLB board member Gerhard Gribkowsky, left, admitted accepting a £28million payment from Bernie Ecclestone, right . He described how Ecclestone kept a firm grip on everything to do with Formula 1, adding; ‘You don’t get anywhere if he doesn’t want it.’ While on BayernLB bank's management board from 2003 to 2008, Gribkowsky oversaw the sale of a majority share of the Formula 1 business which had come into the bank’s possession as a result of the bankruptcy of the Kirch media group. Gribkowsky was accused of accepting the money from Ecclestone to ensure the package was sold to British investor CVC. Gribkowsky oversaw the sale to CVC in 2006 – allegedly forcing it past the rest of the bank's management and making an unnecessary £42million payment to Ecclestone. Gribkowsky claimed Ecclestone told him, ‘If you help me to sell Formula 1, I will employ you as a consultant.’ Shortly afterwards he presented CVC as his preferred candidate. Gribkowsky said Ecclestone had demanded £64million in fees for arranging the sale – a sum the banker said he pushed down to £42million but acknowledged was not necessary at all. In control: The court heard that Bernie Ecclestone, left, pictured with former world champion Mario Andretti during this month's Canadian grand prix, had a firm grip on Formula 1 . Ecclestone then offered him a position as consultant, asking what he wanted with the phrase, 'Tell me numbers that I know to this day,’ said Gribkowsky. He said he wanted $50 million US, and although he was expecting to get just a fraction of it - ‘$10 million would be more normal,’ he said – he got nearly the full amount. Gribkowsky said he gave the money to a children’s cancer charity in Austria, saying he had experienced what families go through when his son became ill. ‘I will save us all the details,’ he told the court. Bernie Ecclestone told the German court the payment was to stop the banker talking to British tax authorities . The prosecutors saw this movement of money as tax evasion. His statement to the court came after talks between his lawyers, the prosecutors and the court. Judge Peter Noll said afterwards that the parties had not reached an agreement – but Gribkowsky spoke in court afterwards anyway, saying the charges were largely correct. He is likely to be jailed for between seven years and 10 months and nine years. His refusal to speak at the trial until now forced the court to hear more than 40 witnesses – including Ecclestone, who described the payment as hush money to stop him from talking to the British tax authorities. He said Gribkowsky had blackmailed him into paying the money otherwise he would speak to the Inland Revenue about his complicated tax affairs. Ecclestone said he had done nothing illegal but that a tax probe would tie him down for years and was ‘something I didn't need.’ Ecclestone is still being investigated by the German authorities, it was confirmed. Gribkowsky has been on trial in Munich on three charges since October. The banker's lawyers have claimed their client is suffering from stress  because of the trial and his conditions in Munich's Stadelheim prison, where Adolf Hitler was once incarcerated.","Ecclestone accused of paying bribe to ensure stake in Formula 1 was sold to a favoured British company .

An email exchange between Travis Alexander and one of his best friends has suggested he was a womanizer who used Jodi Arias physically and called her a 'skank'. In the correspondence from 2007, his friend Sky Hughes, who testified in Arias' murder trial, called him emotionally abusive and a 'heart predator' who liked to collect women. The emails were submitted by the Arias defense but never used in the Arizona court as the judge called them 'hearsay', but a copy has now been obtained by the Arizona Republic. They could help paint an image of Alexander, who was found stabbed, shot and with a sliced throat in his apartment in 2008, as emotionally abusive to Arias, his ex-girlfriend and alleged killer. 'Manipulative': Unreleased emails from a friend of Travis Alexander, left, accuse him of being emotionally abusive towards Jodi Arias, right, who killed him in his Arizona home in 2008 . Arias claimed that she killed him in self defense after he became enraged at her for dropping a camera. Prosecutors assert she murdered him in a fit of jealousy as he was seeing another woman. The emails from Hughes, who testified in the trial, show that in January 2007 she and her husband warned Arias she should move on from Alexander because of how he treated women. 'Travis, with love, you are a heart . predator,' Hughes wrote. 'You take great joy in making women fall for the T-dogg. You . laugh about what you can get away with. 'It would scare me to death if my . little sister liked you, in fact I wouldn't allow it.' When Alexander learned from Arias that Hughes had warned her against him, he responded angrily. Warning: The emails were sent from Sky Hughes, pictured, a close friend of Alexander's. She said that he treated Arias poorly and only used her physically while seeing a string of other women . Friend: But her husband, Chris Hughes, pictured on the witness stand during the trial, said they later fell out with Arias after she eavesdropped on their conversations with Alexander . 'You've crossed the line,' one email subject read, and accused the couple of doing 'irreparable damage to mine and Jodi’s . relationship'. 'She is paranoid that this evil person you have depicted . will someday surface,' he wrote. 'No matter what I say or do she will always have in . the back of her mind of this person that lurks in the shadows.' Hughes responded, pointing out that he only called Arias at 1am, 'jokingly calls her a skank' and would only kiss her when other people weren't looking. 'She was being treated horribly, you weren’t beating her physically, but you were emotionally,' she wrote. '...Know that I would love to see you marry Jodi, but just because you have never seen her cry, doesn't mean she hasn’t been crying. SHE LOVES YOU.' On trial: Arias is accused of killing Alexander in a fit of jealousy but she says she was acting in self defense .

Mrs Hughes also said she told Arias that Alexander was simply using her physically to fulfill him in a way that another woman he was seeing, Deanna Reid, could not. But the Republic added that the Hugheses ended up falling out with Arias in April 2007 when they caught her eavesdropping on conversations she was having with Alexander on two occasions. When Arias asked if they would tell Alexander not to date her, Chris Hughes said he responded: 'We want nothing whatsoever to do with you.' The couple has since spoken out in support of Alexander, claiming that they were manipulated by Arias and that they believed it was 'normal' for their friend to be seeing a string of women. The trial, which began on January 2, had its final defense witness on Wednesday.

David Cameron’s efforts to build a 'special partnership' with India were overshadowed today by questions over alleged corruption in a UK-based company’s contract to supply helicopters to the country’s airforce. The allegations against AgustaWestland have made front-page news in Indian newspapers during Mr Cameron’s three-day visit, and Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh today used a joint press conference to raise 'very serious concerns' about possible ethical breaches. Mr Singh asked for assistance from the UK authorities as Indian investigators look into the allegations. Helicopters: David Cameron and Indian PM Manmohan Singh met for talks in New Delhi today - but they were dominated by discussions about alleged corruption . Mr Cameron - who only yesterday praised Westland’s operations in Yeovil and insisted the allegations were a matter for Italian and Indian authorities, and not the UK - assured him that Britain will respond to any request for information. India has suspended payments under the £480 million contract following Italy’s arrest on corruption and tax fraud charges of Giuseppe Orsi, the chairman and chief executive of AgustaWestland’s Italian parent-company Finmeccanica, as well as AgustaWestland chief executive Bruno Spagnolini. At a joint press conference following talks in Hyderabad House, New Delhi, Mr Singh said he had conveyed to the Prime Minister 'our very serious concerns regarding allegations about unethical means used in securing the 2010 contract for AgustaWestland helicopters'. Bond: The two prime ministers have been holding talks during David Cameron's tour of the country . Talks: The leaders of both countries are having talks focused on boosting trade and commercial ties at the grand Hydrabad House . Allegations: India are concerned about alleged corruption in UK-based AgustaWestland's contract to supply helicopters (file picture) to the country's airforce . The company had been given until February 22 to explain whether 'contractual conditions on unethical practices... have been violated', said the Indian PM. And he added: 'I have sought full assistance from the UK in this case. Prime Minister David Cameron has assured me of the co-operation of his Government in the investigation.' Mr Cameron said: 'We will respond to any request for information. I am glad that the Italian authorities are looking into this issue in detail, as Finmeccanica is an Italian company.' Pledge: The London School of Economics has promised to fund the places of 50 Indian post-graduates to boost academic links . Britain has some of the strongest anti-bribery legislation in the world and will 'root out any problems of bribery and corruption wherever and whenever they appear', Mr Cameron promised. He later told the BBC that he shared Mr Singh’s concerns, saying: 'The defence trade, the defence industry, is an important industry for Britain and I want that to be a clean industry and a clean trade.... 'Be in no doubt we absolutely condemn these sorts of practices.' Finmeccanica said it had 'acted correctly throughout the 40 years it has operated in India'. The statement went on: 'In addition, Finmeccanica underlines that its companies have operated for many years and continue to operate in India, with managerial and operational autonomy, complying fully with Indian Law and the ethics principles of the Group.' Meanwhile more Indian students are to be encouraged to come to the UK with the offer of new scholarships to a top university, it was announced today. The London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) said it will be offering 50 scholarships for Indian postgraduates, starting this autumn. The announcement comes the day after Prime Minister David Cameron used a visit to India to insist that there is 'no limit' on the number of Indians who can study at UK universities, or take up graduate-level jobs after qualifying. The Prime Minister's trips to New York, Brazil and Afghanistan cost nearly £540,000, according to transparency data released today. An Afghanistan visit in July cost £4,060 for travel and accommodation. But a four day trip, which started with a UN meeting in New York followed by Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Brasilia to drum up trade, cost £532,093. The data also revealed that gifts to Mr Cameron between July and September included tickets to see Andy Murray's Wimbledon final, a silver model from Tory donor Sir Anthony Bamford, which he did not keep, and a vase from the King of Bahrain. Deputy PM Nick Clegg did not receive any gifts during that period. Ministers must declare all gifts over £140 and pay for those they wish to keep. LSE said today its new India Scholarships will allow students to study for a Master's degree at the institution. The awards will be worth between £3,000 and £32,000, depending on need, and are open to students with the offer of a place to study for a Master's at the LSE by April 30. LSE director Professor Craig Calhoun, who is travelling with Mr Cameron in India, said: 'We want to ensure that LSE's doors are open to all talented students, regardless of financial circumstances, and are delighted to cement this relationship further by offering 50 scholarships, for graduate study, for students from India.' Mr Cameron later had the unusual experience of being greeted by screams of adulation as he visited a college for girls in New Delhi. However, the screams of around 500 teenage girls were directed not at the PM but at Bollywood film star Aamir Khan, who joined him to chat with students at the Janki Devi Memorial College. Excitement: David Cameron and Bollywood actor Aamir Khan meet students at the Janaki Devi Memorial College in New Delhi today . Popular: The pair we surrounded by young people desperate to speak to them about women's rights and other issues in modern India . The film heartthrob is also a Unicef ambassador for child nutrition and the patron of a women-only taxi service in the city. Khan introduced Mr Cameron to some of the Sakha Cabs workers, who are trained in car mechanics and self-defence at the college. Khan said the girls had mostly wanted to talk with Mr Cameron about women's rights issues in India and about their prospects of studying and working in the UK. The Bollywood star told British reporters travelling with the PM: 'I was meeting him for the first time... It was very interesting to meet with him and understand what his plans are very broadly in terms of development work with the UN and Unicef.' Khan said the younger generation in India no longer felt their views of the UK were coloured by its past as a colonial master. 'I for one feel that what happened in the past happened in the past,' he said. 'I don't think we can hold the present generation of Britishers responsible for something that happened ages ago. It's not fair and it's not something I would like to do.' Arrivals: The politician met the famous actor, who is also a Unicef ambassador, to speak about the organisation's aims in India . Asked if he found that Mr Cameron felt the need to apologise for Britain's colonial past, the actor said: 'No, no, no. I think he's a very positive kind of person. He came across as an extremely dynamic and positive person, and someone who is looking ahead.' Khan said he did not think Mr Cameron had not seen any of his Bollywood films, but said the PM was interested in a TV series he did last year looking at social problems in India. David Cameron has renewed speculation . about his tendency to ‘chillax’ on the job as he broke off his trade . trip to India to play cricket yesterday. The . Prime Minister began his visit with the biggest business delegation in . history by revealing that he stays sane by having a good night’s sleep . and employing good staff to do the work for him. He also claimed he would be watching Bollywood films on the flight out. Breaktime: The Prime Minister took some time out from talks to bat at Mumbai's Oval Maidan yesterday just hours after he confessed he has no time for the workaholic habits of his predecessors . Success: Mr Cameron scored several runs before being cleaned bowled in a game he appeared to enjoy . Yesterday: The Prime Minister also laid a wreath at the memorial to commemorate the policemen who were killed in the terrorist attacks of November 2008, in Mumbai . The Indian leader stressed the importance of education, science and trade in enhancing relations between the two countries. He said: 'I impressed upon the Prime Minister the need for a visa regime that facilitates greater movement of people between the two countries.' In today’s talks, Mr Singh and Mr Cameron agreed closer co-operation between the UK and India over cyber-security, which is expected to see the establishment of a joint taskforce to share information on malicious IT attacks from criminal gangs, terrorists and state agents.","UK-based company AgustaWestland accused of ethical breaches .

Grand drama: Kirk Douglas pictured as Spartacus in scene from the eponymous 1960 film directed by Stanley Kubrick . For some, Easter is an opportunity for Christian reflection. For others it is simply a time to indulge in a chocolate egg or two. But Barry Norman looks forward to the Bank Holiday weekend for a very different reason… the number of epic films traditionally broadcast on television. The film critic has drawn up a list of the top ten epic movies, including modern hits such as The Lord Of The Rings alongside classics such as Ben-Hur and Gone With The Wind. He told the Radio Times Easter has traditionally been ‘a time when TV networks dusted down their epic movies for our edification – Biblical epics of course – to remind us that Easter is about rather more than chocolate eggs and the Easter bunny’. Big budget epics, portraying life on a grand scale, required huge sets and casts in Hollywood’s golden era but now these elements are more often than not replaced by computer generated images. Mr Norman, 79, who presented BBC TV’s Film programme between 1972 and 1998, said he had no problem with the use of such effects to achieve a sense of awe and scale. He said: ‘An argument is currently raging about whether a film can truly be regarded as an epic if it relies heavily on CGI, as all recent films claiming to be epics do. ‘The purists say no. The use of computers to create crowds and exciting effects, they seem to suggest, is cheating. I think the purists should get a life.’ Scroll down for videos . Classic entertainment: Charlton Heston as the eponymous Ben Hur from the 1959 hit . Norman placed Ridley Scott¿s Gladiator, made in 2000, onto the list, lauding it for its 'stirring action, both in and out of the arena' Mr Norman’s list, which is in no particular order, includes two modern works, Sir Peter Jackson’s The Lord Of The Rings trilogy – which he lists as a single film and praises as ‘daring and highly imaginative stuff on every level’ – and  Ridley Scott’s Gladiator, made  in 2000, which he lauds for its  ‘stirring action, both in and out of the arena’. Gladiator was ranked alongside two other Roman epics, Ben-Hur, from 1959, and Spartacus, made the following year. He says of Ben-Hur: ‘I doubt whether even a computer could have produced a more exciting and realistic chariot race than the one in Ben-Hur.’ Of Spartacus, he says: ‘Still one of the best examples of the genre.’ Historical tale: Omar Sharif and Peter O'Toole starring in the film Lawrence Of Arabia in 1962 . Describing Lawrence Of Arabia, made in 1962 and starring Peter O’Toole, he says: ‘Practically every superlative you can think of has been applied to David Lean’s epic …and it deserves them all.’ Apocalypse Now, released in 1979, he calls self-indulgent but magnificent and Gone With The Wind, from 1939, he describes as: ‘The greatest unresolved love affair in cinema.’ Mr Norman said: ‘The main ingredient of an epic movie is size. It has to tell an extraordinary tale – whether Biblical, historical or totally fictional – on a grand scale. ‘And ideally at the heart of it,  never mind the momentous events going on, there should be an intimate story.’ Both Lawrence of Arabia and Ben-Hur are among the epics being screened this Easter weekend.","Lawrence of Arabia and Ben-Hur among the epics on TV this Easter .

A rock used by a Spanish farmer for more than 30 years to press ham has turned out to be an iron meteorite worth at least £3.5million. Faustino Asensio Lopez found the 100kg rock, which measures just 45x31x20cm, as he was tending to livestock with his father in a field near Ciudad Real in 1980. Believing it to be military scrap from the country's civil war, it sat on his patio for more than three decades - its weight used by family members to cure meat. It was only in 2011 when Lopez saw a . TV report on meteorite sightings over Spain that he got in touch with . geologist Juan Carlos Gutierrez Marco. After . extensive anaylsis, the rock was confirmed to be a pre-historic . metallic meteorite - a solid piece of debris from an asteroid or comet . that survived an impact with the Earth's surface. It is the fourth such meteorite to be found in Spain. Previous ones were found near Quesa, in 1898, near Granada in 1912 and near Zaragoza in 1950. Marco said: 'The object remained buried and because of that survived the times of the most demand for metals.' Madrid's Mining Museum opened a display, featuring the fragment broken off for testing, on Wednesday. It is alongside a replica of the original. Lopez, who officially owns the meteorite with his brother Ramon, told Spanish news agency EFE on Thursday they are weighing up whether to put it up for sale. The siblings said they would like it to be 'sold quietly' provided they receive 'a tempting offer' that meets their expectations. The family are considering selling the meteorite - but while they decide, they are moving it to a safe location . They told journalists they realised there was a worldwide market for meteorites and that an offer could be made online. But they stressed they 'would not be making a final decision in the next few days' and have not ruled out keeping it for the family. The pair have already been contacted by possible purchasers in Spain and abroad. As they wait for the offers to flood in, the brothers have said they will keep it hidden in a safe place, where it will remain until they decide what to do.","The 100kg rock landed in a field near Ciudad Real in 1980 .

Sentenced: Partially sighted Andrew Pishides claimed almost £176,000 in benefits while running three businesses . An escort agency boss claimed nearly £176,000 in benefits while running three businesses, a court has heard. Partially-sighted Andrew Pishides, 39, claimed £180 a day for almost four years from the Department for Work and Pensions for non-existent 100 mile taxi fares under a Government disability scheme. Pishides even supported the Access to Work scheme claims with forged receipts. The businessman, who ran Escort Emporium, Escort Solutions and a letting agency for parking spaces called Park Let, was sentenced to an eight month suspended prison sentence, placed on a 12 month supervision order and handed a curfew at Harrow Crown Court today. Sentencing Pishides, Judge Jeremy Donne QC told Pishides: 'You must have lived very well for those four years. 'These offences reflect a moderately sophisticated and extremely persistent fraud that garnered you just shy of one hundred and eighty thousand pounds. 'The benefits represented an income of over forty thousand a year and in addition you had legitimate sources of twenty thousand a year, which would have been equivalent to a six-figure salary before tax.' He added: 'Is it right that you should go to prison for four-and-a-half months? I confess I find this difficult. 'I have a clear public duty to deal with people who commit offences like these, but on balance I am persuaded a prison sentence can be suspended.' Pishides, from Neasden, north west London, pleaded guilty to three counts of obtaining money transfers by deception, namely £106,000 in access to work payments; £37,328 in housing benefit; £28,637 in income support and evading a liability by deception, namely £3,874 in council tax. He was caught out when DWP investigators mounted a surveillance operation, which confirmed their suspicions that Pishides did not travel from his home to Wrotham in rural Kent three times a week to work as a software salesman. The scheme was set up to offer financial assistance with travel costs for those with disabilities to get to work. Hearing: Pishides was sentenced to an eight month suspended prison sentence, placed on a 12 month supervision order and handed a curfew at Harrow Crown Court, pictured . Pishides also failed to declare all of . his bank accounts, his business income and part-ownership of a . mortgage-free Lewisham flat when claiming benefits. Investigators discovered hundreds of pounds a week were being paid into Pishides' bank account from a large number of women who had signed-up to be his escorts. The DWP are pursuing compensation under the Proceeds of Crime Act and are currently deducting £100 per month from Pishides' disability living allowance payments. Defending Pishides, James Maloney told the court: 'The risk of re-conviction is low, the public is not at risk from the defendant. 'His disability would make imprisonment more stressful and difficult than able-bodied defendants and he would be vulnerable to those in the system with more know-how than him.' Pishides suffers from a genetic eye condition, which restricts his field of vision to only 10 per cent and he needs times four magnification in his right eye - his best - to see normally. 'He lost a lot of his life skills, his confidence, his self-esteem and did fall into some form of depression,' added Mr Maloney. 'He is genuinely remorseful about this.' Judge Donne said: 'He was pretty well off compared to a lot of people and it must have been apparent to him that what he was doing was quite egregious. 'What is the court to do with someone who commits offences on this scale for this period of time? 'However, it is a simple fact prison would be more difficult for someone with his difficulties and I have wrestled in my mind as to the correct sentence in this case.'","Partially sighted Andrew Pishides claimed £180-a-day for bogus taxis to work .

John Hayes is to move to Number 10 to act as a 'parliamentary greybeard' for the PM . David Cameron moved to build bridges with his backbenchers yesterday by appointing a right-winger to be his eyes and ears in Parliament. Energy Minister John Hayes – who has battled with the Lib Dems over windfarms –  become a Cabinet Office Minister. As Mr Cameron’s senior Parliamentary adviser, Mr Hayes, a flamboyant and popular right-wing veteran, will channel concerns from MPs to the Prime Minister. It is a role last carried out by Andrew Mackay when the Tories were in opposition. Mr Hayes’s surprise appointment follows mutterings about a potential Tory leadership challenge and complaints from ministers about an increasingly rebellious Parliamentary party. His energy responsibilities will pass to Business Minister Michael Fallon, one of the Tories’ toughest ministers. The move comes on the day the Spectator magazine reported that Cabinet ministers believe 25 MPs have written to Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee demanding a leadership election. The rebels would need 46 to prompt a vote. Mr Brady refused to comment on the claims. Mr Hayes’s appointment is an admission that Mr Cameron and his circle of aides have failed to engage productively with a growing section of his party. Mr Hayes proved a controversial energy minister, when he ruled out any more onshore wind farms, declaring 'enough is enough' The move is seen as a pre-emptive . measure by Mr Cameron ahead of difficult local elections in May, where . the Tories are expected to lose hundreds of council seats to Labour and . the UK Independence Party. Allies of backbencher Adam Afriyie . have been openly advancing his leadership prospects and Home Secretary . Theresa May is also putting a campaign together in private. Both say . they would not challenge Mr Cameron, but his aides admit they need to . raise their game. The Prime Minister took to Twitter to say he was 'delighted' by the shake up to his team . Business minister Michael Fallon adds energy to . his responsibilities, as David Cameron moves to strengthen his team's . links with the Tory backbenches . John Hayes . John Hayes could not be more different to the privileged elite who are said to dominate the upper echelons of the Tory party. Boxer, . union member, antiques collector, jam maker: he is one of a handful of . working class, grammar school-educated Conservative ministers in the . government. He has strong . views on almost everything, from gay marriage and most famously wind . farms to the right way to decorate a Christmas cake. (I just think real . icing is very important.) The . son of a power station worker, he grew up on a council estate in south . east London and is 'very proud' of his working class roots. In . Who's Who he lists his interests as: 'The arts (particularly English . painting, poetry and prose), good food and wine, many sports (including . darts and boxing), gardening, making jam, antiques, architecture, . aesthetics.' A former county councillor in Nottinghamshire, he was elected as MP for South Holland and the Deepings in Lincolnshire in 1997. Within . two years William Hague appointed him as vice-chairman of the Tory . party, responsible for campaigning before becoming shadow schools . minister in 2000 and served on the opposition frontbench for Iain Duncan . Smith, for whom he was once a speech writer, Michael Howard and later . David Cameron. However, he was also an outspoken critic of Mr Cameron's style in the early days of the leadership. In . 2006 he dismissed plans for an A-list of high-flying Tory candidates 'a . bizarre theory of people who spend too much time with the pseuds and . posers of London's chi-chi set and not enough time in normal Britain'. He is chairman of the Cornerstone Group of traditional conservatives, whose motto is 'faith, flag and family'. His . rise through the political ranks passed almost unnoticed until last . year he declared war on wind farms, and gained a reputation for speaking . for many Tory backbenchers who felt Downing Street was not listening to . their concerns. ‘Do we want to strengthen our . relations with the Parliamentary party? Of course we do,’ said a Downing . Street source. ‘John’s going to be a massive asset.’ Mr Hayes is a founder member of the . Cornerstone Group of socially conservative Tories and will be expected . to calm anger on that wing of the party about Mr Cameron’s support for . gay marriage. Whether he can also get Eurosceptics and Thatcherites demanding tax cuts back on board remains to be seen. One minister who is close to Mr . Cameron said of Mr Hayes: ‘We’ve needed someone like that for a long . time. John reaches parts of the party that others do not reach. It shows . the PM is aware that he needs to do more to keep MPs in the loop.’ Mr Hayes becomes a minister of state . without portfolio in the Cabinet Office and has been appointed to the . Privy Council. But some MPs said it will take more than his appointment . to repair relations with the party. ■The Tories would be neck and neck with Labour if Boris Johnson replaced Mr Cameron as leader, a poll revealed. The YouGov survey put Labour’s lead . at six points, on 37 per cent to the Tories’ 31. But when voters are . asked how they would vote if the Mayor of London was Tory leader, the . parties are tied on 37 per cent. Crucially, a Boris leadership would . lure a third of UKIP voters to the Tories. Business minister Michael Fallon adds energy to his brief . Michael Fallon has been brought in to give the Energy Department a ‘business mindset’ and calm tensions about wind farms and rising fuel bills. Anti-turbine campaigners will be cheered by his remarks yesterday that he would concentrate on nuclear power, oil, gas, and offshore wind. But he failed to mention the controversial topic of onshore windfarms. Party sources understand he is ‘very aware’ of concerns about the impact of turbines on the landscape. They say that, while he will back the growth of green industries, he will take a ‘very robust’ approach to attempts to overburden other sectors of the economy with environmental taxes and rules. Mr Fallon, a rising star of the Conservative party, is renowned for driving projects through. His brief is to help the Energy and Climate Change Department attract the £110billion of private sector investment it desperately needs for new energy generation, particularly in nuclear power stations. Fears are growing that failure to do so could see further increases in electricity bills and even blackouts. There are tensions between his new boss, Lib Dem Energy Secretary Ed Davey, who wants to build up the renewable energy sector, and the Treasury which says this would burden other sectors with green taxes and regulations. Mr Fallon has been urged to stand up to Liberal Democrats and EU ministers who want to increase the target for the amount of energy which must come from ‘green’ sources – currently 15 per cent by 2020. Mr Fallon will retain his role as a business minister.","Tory will move from energy to new role as senior advisor to No. 10 .

Ratón - whose name translates to Mouse in English - passed away in Spain yesterday after suffering from a limp for more than six weeks. Aged 11, the 79 stone beast had been a star attraction at events across the country - where runners are encouraged to sprint past the animals to 'show their bravado'. Scroll down for video . Ratón, pictured in September 2011 in a fight at Canals, Valencia, became legendary in Spain due to the large number of gorings he carried out . Ratón's owner plans to stuff the body of the 79 stone beast and display him at his farm . The 'vaca', as it is dubbed by locals, regularly attracts hundreds of spectators - but unlike a bullfight does not end with the animal's death. Ratón commanded fees of up to €10,000 (£8,540) per appearance, and had last taken to the sand at the bullring in Valencia on March 15. Ratón's owner, Gregorio de Jesús, told El Pais that his body will now be stuffed and displayed on the farm he owns in Campanar, near Valencia. Ratón was born to Caracol and Fusilera on April 12 2001 and shot to fame, aged six in 2006, when he fatally gored a 54-year-old man in Sagunto. Rather than lead to his retirement, the death sparked a flood of offers for him to appear at events across the country. In 2008, he struck again by killing a 27-year-old by goring him in the neck.  It led to de Jesus to again consider ending his career. But he soon decided not to, telling El Pais: 'What do you do if they put a cheque in front of you and say 'fill in the amount you want'?' Ratón killed three people and injured thirty during his 10-year career . In 2009, he then boasted about his animal, by telling the same newspaper: 'He's agile, intelligent, fast. Very happy. 'But he's not stupid, he's not like other bulls who act on instinct and hit against everything. 'This one thinks, analyses and then attacks.' Ratón's final kill came in 2011, when he gored a 29-year-old man at a festival in Xativa.","Ratón died yesterday after suffering from a limp for more than six weeks .

A four-times married woman stabbed her latest husband to death with a pair of dress-making scissors because he wouldn't help her clean the house, a court heard yesterday. Mother-of-five Sandra Clinch, 49, killed Alan Clinch, 48, after a 'blazing row' over his refusal to tidy up before some friends came over for Sunday lunch. Clinch was nicknamed the Hulk by neighbours because of her mood swings and violent temper, the court was told. They could hear her shouting and ranting at her husband at least once a week. 'Purely fanciful': The mother-of-five told police she had thrown the scissors at her husband, but later changed her account, saying he had walked into them by accident . Sharp: Mrs Clinch admits she threw the new pair of dress scissors at her husband during a row . She is accused of lashing out – . stabbing Mr Clinch in the heart and lungs with the new red-handled . dressmaking scissors – after he told her to 'shut up'. He collapsed in a pool of blood and . his wife dialled 999 – telling the operator that she had thrown the . scissors at him, the court was told. Mr Clinch was airlifted to hospital . but he died from a single wound to the chest. The blades had been driven . four inches into his body, between two ribs. The jury was told that . experts said it was extremely unlikely that thrown blades would . penetrate his clothing – a rugby shirt over a  T-shirt – before . embedding themselves deep in his chest. Prosecutor Paul Dunkels QC told  Truro . Crown Court: 'The blades of the scissors penetrated ten to 12cm into . his chest.The blade caused serious injury to his left lung and his . heart. 'She immediately called 999 and paramedics attended.' Guilty: Clinch was convicted of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility, but cleared of murder at Truro Crown Court (above) The court heard Mrs Clinch dialled 999 . on May 13  – around two hours before their friends were due to arrive . for Sunday lunch at their home in Cornwall. The scissors, the court was told, were brand new and intended for use on the dress-making course on which Clinch had enrolled. She told the 999 operator: 'I threw a . pair of scissors at him and got him in his chest and he is pouring . blood, it's right by his heart. 'I did pull them out but I didn't realise I'd got him, we were having an argument and I picked them up and threw them at him.' Mr Clinch was airlifted to Derriford Hospital in Plymouth but later died from a single chest wound . When paramedics arrived she said: . 'Please help him, I love him so much.' Jurors were played a recording of . the 999 call in which a hysterical Clinch screams: 'He's gone, he's . dead.' Mr Dunkels said: 'In her call, she used the word “stabbed”. Her account then became that she threw the scissors at him. 'By the time of her first police interview, her account changed again to having randomly thrown the scissors. 'We say she was closest to the truth at the beginning.' Mr Dunkels said: 'The only way the defendant could have got the scissors ten to 12cm into his chest was by stabbing him.' Clinch met her husband in 2001 in . Luton, before they moved to their most recent home in Darite, near . Liskeard in Cornwall, in 2006. Mr Dunkels said the defendant had a history of violence against her husband. He added: 'She has always had a . violent temper. During the course of this trial you will hear evidence . from members of her family about how regularly the defendant would lose . her temper and attack them, sometimes using household objects as . weapons. Sandra Clinch was married three times before Alan.' He added that neighbours would often see and hear the couple arguing. One of them, Jordan Dennis, 17, said . Clinch was likened to comic book character The Incredible Hulk because . of her mood swings, adding: 'She would change into a completely . different person.' His father Adrian Dennis told the . court: 'About once a week I would hear very one-sided, heated rows. Only . one voice was heard, the voice of Sandra.' He added that he closed his doors and . windows because of the noise and the language used and described the . defendant as 'aggressive and scary'. Lisa Townsend, who lived next door to . the Clinch family, described American car enthusiast Mr Clinch as . 'lovely, very helpful and hard-working', but said he had become . withdrawn lately. The court heard that Clinch had joined . her husband working at Homebase and their manager Michael Radford, . described an incident when he saw Clinch attack her husband in the car . park.

Jailed: Professor Paul Frampton has been sentenced to almost four years in a Buenos Aires jail for drug trafficking . An eminent British scientist has been jailed for almost five years after being caught smuggling cocaine in a bid to impress a glamour model more than three decades  his junior. Professor Paul Frampton, 68, claimed he was duped into carrying the drugs by gangsters who struck up a relationship with him online by pretending to be former Miss Bikini World Denise Milani. In fact, the Czech-born model, who is in her 30s and married, had never been in contact with the Oxford-educated physicist and had no idea that her identity was being used for the honeytrap sting. Frampton, originally from Kidderminster, Worcestershire, was arrested in January after being stopped at Ezeiza International Airport in Buenos Aires, Argentina, as he tried to board a plane to  Peru with two kilos of cocaine in his luggage. The drugs were found wrapped in gift paper hidden inside the lining of his suitcase. Frampton said in a newspaper interview after his arrest: . ‘Perhaps I should have realised earlier but the fraudster was very good and very intelligent. ‘For 11 weeks I thought I was chatting with an attractive woman.’ The divorcee, who had been living in the US and teaching physics at the University of North Carolina for over 30 years, had first travelled to La Paz, Bolivia, where he thought he was going to meet Miss Milani for the first time. He mistakenly believed he had been . chatting regularly with her over the internet for several months, when . in fact the messages were sent by someone else using her identity. Married model Denise Milani, had no idea her identity was being used, was shocked at the sting . Meeting for the first time: Prof Frampton agreed to take a suitcase he was told belonged to Miss Milani from La Paz in Bolvia to Buenos Aires after a middle-aged man gave it to him . Claimed he was duped: Prof Frampton said it was a 'honeytrap sting' involving bikini model Denise Milani claiming he had been tricked into carrying the drugs by gangsters who posed on the internet as the model . In La Paz he met a middle-aged man in . a hotel who gave him the suitcase, saying it belonged to  Miss Milani . and asking him to take it to her. The following day he travelled to . Buenos Aires and was instructed to fly to Brussels where he believed he . would finally meet his ‘girlfriend’. But after waiting 36 hours at the . airport for her to send him an electronic ticket, he changed his mind . and decided to return to the US via Peru. The scientist has now been convicted . of drug-trafficking at a court in Argentina after prosecutor Mario . Villar read the court emails and text messages he sent his ‘girlfriend’ and a friend in the US while waiting at the airport. According to Argentinian newspaper . Clarin, they included ‘I’m worried about the sniffer dogs’, ‘I’m looking . after your special little suitcase’ and ‘In Bolivia this is worth . nothing, in Europe it’s worth millions’. Professor Paul Frampton, pictured with his ex-wife Anne-Marie Frampton, was found with drugs wrapped in gift paper hidden inside the lining of his suitcase . Miss Bikini World: Prof Frampton said he travelled to Buenos Aires to start a new life with Miss Milani. She was completely unaware that her identity had been used in the crime . The prosecutor also showed the court a . note written by the scientist reading: ‘1grm/200U$S. 2000grms/400000 . U$S.’ A source told the newspaper: ‘At the trial he said he had written . it after being arrested, but the arrest witnesses were asked to come . back to court and they denied that.’ Miss Milani, who was completely . unaware she was being used as a honeytrap, has since spoken of her shock . at being dragged into the sting. The scientist’s ex-wife, Anne-Marie . Frampton, 71, has described him as ‘a naive fool’. They divorced several . years ago after  15 years of marriage but remain close friends. Frampton, who graduated with  a . double first from Brasenose College, Oxford, was sentenced to four years . and eight months in prison, which he is expected to serve at Villa . Devoto Prison in Buenos Aires. The jail was the scene of some of the worst riots in Argentine history in 1978 which left 62 people dead. The scientist was originally held . there on remand but had been released and put under house arrest for . health reasons. He  suffers from high blood pressure and lung problems. He had been facing up to 16 years behind bars. His defence lawyer Eduardo Oderigo . said: ‘There were many good reasons to have acquitted him. I set them . out in his defence.

Pope Francis (left) with Jorge Videla, head of the Argentine Junta, responsible for the death, disappearance and torture of tens of thousands of Argentines in its so-called Dirty War . Pope Francis I has been accused of turning his back on a family who lost five relatives to the military junta during Argentina's Dirty War. The De la Cuadra family appealed to the Jesuit leader in Rome for help when the relatives disappeared, including pregnant Elena De la Cuadra who was kidnapped and killed in 1977. The leader urged then head of the Argentinian Jesuits and now Pope Francis, Jose Mario Bergoglio, to help them and in turn he appointed a monsignor, Mario Picchi, to investigate. After several months the monsignor passed a written note from a military colonel to the family informing them that Elena had given birth in captivity but the baby girl had been adopted. According to the family, the note allegedly said that the girl, who the family named Ana, had been given to a family that was 'too important' for the adoption to be reversed. Despite the existence of the note in a case he was said to be personally involved in, Bergoglio testified in 2010 that he was unaware that any babies had been 'stolen' until well after the end of the dictatorship. It is unclear whether the note was ever seen by the now Pope. Estela de la Cuadra, whose mother Alicia co-founded the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo in 1977 in hopes of identifying the stolen babies, said: 'Bergoglio has a very cowardly attitude when it comes to something so terrible as the theft of babies. 'He says he didn’t know anything about it until 1985. 'He doesn’t face this reality and it doesn’t bother him. 'The question is how to save his name, save himself. But he can’t keep these allegations from reaching the public. The people know how he is.' She told Brazilian newspaper O Globo: 'The Catholic Church has chosen a person who for us, families of the victims of repression exercised by the military, was complicit in a genocidal government.' The new Pope has already been accused in some quarters of failing to stand up to the junta with critics claiming that Jorge Mario Bergoglio did little to help those who disappeared when the country was under right-wing military rule – and too much to criticise the left-wing opponents of the generals. He has even been accused of turning a blind eye to the rounding up and torturing of his own Jesuit priests, something he strongly denies. Accusations: Human rights activist Estela de la Cuadra has claimed that the Pope turned his back on her family when five of her relatives went missing during the Argentina 'Dirty War' 'Disappeared': Alicia De la Cuada who set up a campaign group to find babies 'stolen' in the Dirty War lost her daughter Elena De la Cuada and her son in law Hector Baratti . Newly elected Pope Francis I appears on the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica after being elected by the conclave of cardinals, at the Vatican . The family of a priest kidnapped and tortured with the alleged complicity of the new Pope also described his election as 'a black day' in an emotional tweet. Pope Francis has been accused of failing to prevent the five-month ordeal priests Orlando Yorio and Francisco Jalics underwent in 1976. The two priests were kidnapped and tortured at a military prison in Buenos Aires before being drugged, blindfolded and dumped in a field. Angela Lerena, an Argentine journalist and relative of Father Orlando, described the election of Pope Francis as 'a black day' for her family in a tweet. Ms Lerena, who is married to Father Orlando's nephew, added: 'There is a family who have been waiting for 35 years for justice. Today I spoke in their name.' The two priests were seized after being branded dissidents for their work with the poor in Buenos Aires. Investigative journalist Horacio Verbitsky has published a book called The Silence accusing Bergoglio of being complicit in the kidnappings. It claims he withdrew support for the two priests' work, effectively handing them over to the death squads. Then and now: Pope Francis as a young priest in Buenos Aires, left, and performing a mass as a Cardinal before becoming Pope, right . Father Orlando died from natural . causes in 2000 and Father Francisco has refused to speak about his . ordeal since moving to a German monastery. But Father Orlando's brother Rodolfo and sister Graciela have both accused the new Pope of failing to stop the torture. Rodolfo said in a 2010 interview: 'As . the person in charge he should have protected them from the rumours, . from the false charges that ended with their illegal arrests.' Bergoglio was called to give evidence at a 2010 hearing into the atrocities carried out at the military prison. He had reportedly refused to testify . on two previous occasions, and lawyers said he was evasive while . eventually giving his account. But he has since vigorously denied the accusations, describing them as 'an old slander'. He claims he instructed the two . priests to give up their work in the slums for their own safety, and . that he worked behind-the-scenes to ensure their release. He recently told Clarin newspaper: 'I did what I could with the age and little influence I had.' Argentine human rights lawyer Myriam . Bregman said that church leaders knew what was happening in the Dirty . War, yet backed the regime. ‘The dictatorship could not have operated . this way without this key support,’ she said. Jorge Videla . Now commonly known as the Dirty War, or the Guerra Sucia in Spanish, the Argentinian Process of National Reorganisation saw the country under the rule of a harsh military junta between 1976 and 1983. After the death of the controversial President Juan Peron in 1974, his wife and vice president, Isabel Peron, took power. She was not very strong politically and a military junta led a coup against her and removed her from office. The junta maintained its grip on power by cracking down on anybody whom they believed was challenging their authority . Led for much of the period by Jorge Videla, the junta oversaw a period of state terrorism and counter guerrilla warfare which saw between 10,000 and 30,000 people killed or 'disappear'. Many of them are said to have been taken to secret government detention centres where they were tortured and killed. The 'war' was the junta's attempt to quash leftist activists who called for a socialist government. Among the most harrowing aspects of the so-called war was the disappearance of an estimated 500 babies. During the period, the Catholic Church was largely seen to support the military led government. Basic civil liberties were restored and a ban on political parties lifted after Argentina lost the war with Britain over the Falklands in 1982 and Raul Alfonsin's civilian government eventually took over in December 1983. But the new Pope is said by supporters to have worked regularly and at some danger to himself to curb the excesses of the military. They . say that he does not speak out against the allegation because of his . humility and the fact that he does not want to sink to his critics' level. They claim that Francis I took . major risks to save so-called 'subversives' during the 1976-1983 . dictatorship, but never spoke about it publicly before his 2010 . biography The Jesuit. In the book, Bergoglio explained that he didn’t want to stoop to his critics’ level - and then shared some of his stories. He said he once passed his Argentine . identity papers to a wanted man with a similar appearance, enabling him . to escape over the border to Brazil, and added that many times he . sheltered people inside church properties before they were safely . delivered into exile. Under Bergoglio’s leadership, . Argentina’s bishops also issued a collective apology in October 2012 for . the church’s failures to protect its flock during the dictatorship, but . the statement blamed the era’s violence in roughly equal measure on . both the junta and its enemies. The period became a by-word for . brutality, with thousands of families suffering the disappearance of . loved ones and the adoption by the armed forces of murder methods such . as throwing detainees out of aeroplanes. Liberal . critics point to Bergoglio’s refusal to give evidence in open court on . the events of the 1970s until 2010, when his answers were considered . evasive by some.","The De la Cuadra family asked the Jesuits to help find missing relatives .

Ruby C. Klokow had already entered a no contest plea in February to the second-degree murder charge of her six-month-old daughter in 1957, however, a deal between the prosecution and defense led her to believe she would spend less than a month behind bars. Blinking rapidly as Judge Angela Sutkiewicz passed sentence, the Sheboygan County judge told her that abiding by the plea agreement would have been an affront to justice. Ruby Klokow, behind glass, reacts to being sentenced to 10 years in prison Wednesday May 1, 2013, in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, for the 1957 death of her six-month-old daughter . 'What happened to Jeaneen Klokow was no accident. It was caused by the defendant's reckless actions,' said Judge Angela Sutkiewicz. Klokow had pleaded no contest in February to a charge of second-degree murder stemming from the 1957 death of her 6-month-old daughter. At the time, Jeaneen's death was ruled an accident but the case was reopened in 2008 after Klokow's son came forward with allegations of horrific child abuse. Under questioning by investigators, Klokow acknowledged throwing Jeaneen roughly on the couch, causing her to bounce to the floor. The grandmother (left) entered a no-contest plea to the charges of murdering her daughter Jeaneen (right) on the understanding that she would receive a shorter sentence . When the sentence was handed down an audible gasp filled the courtroom. Klokow, who had been occasionally dabbing her eyes and nose with a wadded-up tissue, closed her eyes and then blinked rapidly several times. Defense attorney Kirk Obear told reporters afterward he was surprised by the sentence. 'If we could do it all over again, we'd have a trial and we'd win,' Obear said. A . number of Klokow's relatives tried to persuade the judge that Klokow . already had been punished enough through decades of knowing what . happened to her baby. Ruby Klokow, right behind glass, reacts as her sister, Linda Kimpell, tries to hold her hands through the glass . Judge Angela Sutkiewicz sentenced Ruby C. Klokow to a maximum of 10 years in prison . He promised to initiate an appeal Thursday morning, in part on the basis of the sentencing process. He noted that the pre-sentencing report raised allegations that Klokow also physically and emotionally abused her other children decades ago, even though the statute of limitations on those abuse claims would have run out. He said those allegations shouldn't have been relevant for the purpose of sentencing. Klokow likely will be granted parole when she becomes eligible in 2 1/2 years, district attorney Joe DeCecco said . The case presented a number of quandaries for prosecutors. Klokow would have had to be tried for second-degree murder, a now-outdated charge, under the standards in play at the time of the 1957 crime. The obligations would include proving the defendant had a 'depraved mind,' a term so vague it was impossible to predict how jurors would interpret it in 2013. DeCecco noted other reasons why the case would be difficult to prosecute. Key witnesses had died, memories had faded and jurors were likely to see Klokow as a sympathetic maternal or grandmotherly figure. So he worked out a plea agreement calling for a lenient sentence, knowing the judge would probably overrule him with a much tougher punishment. He and Obear each recommended a sentence of 45 days in jail and 10 years of probation. But a judge is not bound by plea agreements, and Sutkiewicz did override this one. Ruby Klokow, (right), is taken into custody after being sentenced to 10 years in prison on Wednesday for the 1957 death of her six-month-old daughter . 'Anything but incarceration would diminish the seriousness of the offense,' Sutkiewicz said. Klokow, who sat in a pink turtleneck sweater and black slacks, wept when the sentence was handed down. Later, she stood at the clear plastic partition separating her from her supporters, their hands pressed against opposite sides of the window as if to touch one last time. Eventually Klokow was led weeping from the courtroom. Supporters who reached out to touch her were nudged away by deputies. Klokow's case was delayed several times after she was charged in 2011. Her mental-health status was in question but a judge ultimately decided she was competent to assist in her defense. An initial autopsy found that Jeaneen suffered two brain hemorrhages, a partially collapsed lung and three scalp bruises. However the death was ruled accidental. The baby's death haunted Jeaneen's older brother, James Klokow Jr., now 57. He says he grew up traumatized because his mother always told him he was to blame for his baby sister's death because the girl fell while Ruby Klokow was distracted by his misbehavior. A Wisconsin woman accused of killing her baby more than 50 years ago showed up at her sentencing hearing Wednesday expecting to be sentenced to 45 days in jail as part of a plea agreement forged between lawyers . James Klokow eventually told police in 2008 of abuse he suffered at the hands of his mother. He told investigators she often beat and choked him and kicked him with steel-toed boots. He said his mother broke his arm and nose, and described how she covered the head of his mentally challenged younger brother, Bruce, and struck the wailing boy's toes one by one with a hammer. Obear said those events either never happened or that Klokow's now-deceased husband was the actual abuser. Before his mother's sentencing, James Klokow read a tearful statement to the judge . 'My mother killed my baby sister,' he said, his voice cracking. 'She did not cherish her, she did not love her, she did not protect her. ... I feel my mother should get 20 years in prison.' In addition to Jeaneen, James and Bruce, Klokow had a fourth child, Scott, who died as a baby. His body was disinterred along with Jeaneen's as police investigated but his death couldn't be considered suspicious.","Ruby C. Klokow entered a no-contest plea to the murder charge .

Pc Mike Baillon, 42, claimed he was forced out of his job after becoming the butt of jokes from fellow officers over CCTV footage of him battering the Range Rover of 74-year-old driver Robert Whatley, near Usk in Monmouthshire, South Wales.

Families who have their holidays ruined by long flight delays will at last be able to claim compensation. A landmark ruling has opened the floodgates for hundreds of thousands of claims, and could cost airlines millions. It demonstrated that Britons have the right to compensation of up to £480, plus expenses, for hold-ups longer than three hours. Families who have their holidays ruined by long flight delays will at last be able to claim compensation. Pictured is a family asleep at Heathrow Airport after heavy snow caused delays earlier this month . Last October the European Court of . Justice ruled that delays caused by airline failures, such as technical . faults or a lack of flight crew, merited compensation. This week a judge in Staffordshire implemented that decision for the first time. He awarded a former teacher and his wife £680, after their flight home from Tenerife with Thomas Cook was delayed by 22 hours. Jeff Halsall won £680 from Thomas Cook on Monday in a landmark case that could open the doors to other claims from thousands of passengers . The decision is a major reversal for . airlines, and consumer groups say it will ensure they treat travellers . more fairly in future. Historically, critics say, the firms have rejected most claims as a matter of course. Airlines will still be able to deny payouts where delays are outside their control, such as during bad weather or strikes. But, in theory, travellers can now claim compensation for flight delays dating back to 2005. More than 200million passengers use UK airports each year. Crude estimates suggest that two . million of these are delayed for more than three hours, with at least . 400,000 eligible for compensation. The Staffordshire case relates to Jeff and Joyce Halsall, from Kidsgrove, who took Thomas Cook to court in 2009. A judge initially rejected the claim . after the holiday company, which runs its own airline, said the delay . was due to an ‘exceptional circumstance’ beyond its control. In fact, . the flight, on October 31, 2009, was delayed by a mechanical fault. Mr Halsall, 58, appealed against the . decision after learning of the European legislation, which allows people . to claim between £200 and £480 if they are delayed for more than three . hours. On Monday the couple won the case. A . judge at Stoke-on-Trent County Court awarded 800 euros (£680) in . compensation and expenses incurred in pursuing the legal action. Jeff & Joyce Halsall on holiday in Tenerife in 2009. Their flight home was delayed for 22 hours . Mr Halsall, a retired economics and business teacher, whose compensation claim was initially rejected . Mr Halsall, a retired economics and . business teacher, said: ‘I am delighted to have won my legal case and I . certainly hope passengers who were fobbed off over the past five years . can now claim back what is owed to them. ‘It doesn’t matter how much people pay . for their flight, everyone is entitled to this. People probably think . they have to go to court to do this but they don’t, all they need to do . is write to their airline.’ The Civil Aviation Authority said Mr Halsall’s legal victory appears to be the first in Britain since the European ruling. Raymond Veldkamp runs a website called . Flight Delayed, which helps travellers fight for compensation. He . estimates that as many as two million suffer delays of more than three . hours when using UK airports each year. If half of these were the airline’s . fault, one million might be eligible for compensation. Even if that . figure was only one in five, 400,000 would still be eligible. Mr Veldkamp estimates £73million is owed to travellers across Europe for the past five years. Catherine Beader, the Lib Dem MEP for . South East England, said: ‘It is vitally important to raise awareness of . this legislation because many simply do not realise they may be . entitled to compensation.’ Raymond Veldkamp, who runs a website called Flight Delayed, estimates £73million is owed to travellers across Europe for the past five years . Thomas Cook apologised to Mr and Mrs Halsall for their 22-hour delay on a flight from Tenerife to the East Midlands because of a technical fault . Thomas Cook said it had offered Mr Halsall more money than the figure eventually awarded by the court. A spokesman said: ‘We appreciate how . frustrating flight delays can be and we’ve reiterated our apology to Mr . Halsall for the lengthy wait he and his wife experienced. ‘We always look at claims such as this fairly and make every effort to resolve complaints without the need for a court hearing.’ Stranded travellers rest at Heathrow airport Terminal 5 after snow hit the region. The landmark ruling means families whose flights have been delayed could be awarded compensation . Passengers wait to hear of any news about their flight departures after long delays and cancellations due to severe cold weather this month . If your flight is delayed by more than three hours, cancelled or overbooked, you may be able to claim. Compensation is £199 for inter-EU flights of 930 miles or less, £320 for flights between 930 and 1,860 miles and £480 for other journeys. It applies to any flight leaving an EU airport and any flight into the EU on an EU-based airline. Passengers can claim by telling the airline their flight number, names and reason for the delay. If rejected, the case can go to county court. Flight-delayed.co.uk will pursue a claim for a fee of £14 or £20.50, and the Civil Aviation Authority’s website lets people download a standard letter that they can fill out and send to the airline.

A heavily pregnant mother who falsely claimed she was attacked by a knife-wielding intruder to get her husband’s attention has been exposed as a benefit cheat after letting slip she worked as a chef. Amy Tatton had originally told police she had come face to face with an armed man in her kitchen after getting out of bed at 3am for a glass of water. But the 30-year-old, who is due to give birth to her second child in six weeks’ time, later admitted she invented the story to grab the attention of her husband Timothy, 26 – and was charged with wasting police time. She later faced a second investigation by benefits officials after telling her local paper in an interview about her ‘terrifying encounter’ that she worked as a chef. Caught out: Amy Tatton, of Lincoln, falsely claimed she was attacked by a knife-wielding intruder to get her husband's attention. But she was exposed as a benefit cheat after letting slip she worked as a chef . Tatton pleaded guilty to wasting police time earlier this year and was ordered to pay just £500 compensation – although her lies cost taxpayers £1,238.71 in wasted man hours and redundant forensic tests. But after a tell-all interview with the Lincolnshire Echo, checks showed that she had failed to declare he job. Benefits officials also discovered that she failed to reveal that she was on child tax credits and maternity allowance. James Ellis, prosecuting, told Lincoln Magistrates Court, that the charges were a direct result of her interview. Tatton, of Lincoln, admitted five charges of failing to notify changes in her circumstances between 5 March 2010 and 29 July 2012. She was given a 12 month conditional discharge and ordered to repay £2,481.14 in overpaid housing benefit and £75 costs. Fined: Tatton pleaded guilty to wasting police time earlier this year and was ordered to pay £500 compensation, although her lies cost taxpayers' £1,238.71 in wasted man hours and redundant forensic tests . Mitigating, Bill Miller said: ‘Her initial claim in January 2010 was perfectly valid but thereafter my client did start working. ‘Her recollection is that she notified the local authority by telephone of that employment but there is no record of that and it may be that her recollection is deficient. ‘She then began working directly for a nursery. She then claimed maternity allowance at the Job Centre which ended when she went back to work. ‘Her understanding of the claim for child tax credit is that her husband had notified the authorities about the birth of their child. He said that she no longer in employment and no longer receives Income Support. Tatton was arrested originally arrested in September after holes in her account emerged and she was charged in November. She told investigators and her local newspaper that the burglar shoved her against the kitchen worktop and struck her across the face. She also claimed the man grabbed a vegetable knife and scraped it down her arm before fleeing empty handed and said her husband slept through the incident in June last year. Tatton claimed the suspect was 5ft 7in tall, with short blond hair, and was wearing dark trousers and jacket. Officers even showed her dozens of pictures of burglars from their database in a bid to catch the culprit. Tatton admitted wasting police time on June 20 last year in an appearance before Lincoln magistrates last month. She even tried to blame her husband, moaning to officers about him neglecting her and not showing her enough attention.","Amy Tatton falsely told police she had been confronted by an armed man .

The Labour leadership today avoided an embarrassing stand-off with their union paymasters after a motion criticising their support for public sector pay freezes was watered down. Ed Miliband and Ed Balls risked humiliation, when a motion condemned their support for the government curbs on wage rises. But after a backroom deal, the motion was torn up and replaced with one merely 'noting' the policy, although angry union leaders ratcheted up their rhetoric against the party's leaders. Scroll down for video . Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls today gave a series of TV interviews where he insisted he would not be swayed by the unions . Dave Prentis, general secretary of Unison, told delegates that workers wanted hope from their leaders, not 'economic lectures which simply justify a Tory agenda'. Len McCluskey, general secretary of . the Unite union which has given almost £7million to Labour in the last . two years, claimed his members were ‘furious’ at the Labour leaderships . ‘crazy’ policy of supporting pay restraint. He told Mr Miliband: 'A public spending squeeze while the City continues to let rip is simply not acceptable. 'It is time for Labour to once and for all turn its back on the neo-liberalism of the past. 'Reject the siren voices from those whose policies and philosophy have been discredited, and embrace the radical alternative the country wants, which is the only way - the only way Labour will return to power.' Mr Miliband – dubbed ‘Red Ed’ for his . closeness to the unions when he became leader two years ago – is now . being forced to defend the government’s policy of not increasing the . wages state workers at a time of spending cuts. The row threatenened to overshadow today’s keynote speech by Mr Balls, who today claimed the ‘vast majority’ of union members back his strategy. GMB leader Paul Kenny today targeted Mr Balls with a four-page report on Mr Balls which he said was aimed at highlighting his call for the Labour leadership to connect with ordinary workers. 'We have to make sure that the public face of the party can connect with the public and that they are not damaged or dented by past mistakes which have not been owned up to.' Ed Balls goes through his speech with Labour leader Ed Miliband at their conference hotel in Manchester . But today Mr Balls, who was booed when the addressed the TUC last month, insisted it was not his job to be popular. ‘What people want is a unified Labour Party taking the argument to the country against a coalition Government which is divided and failing and that's what I'm going to do. ‘It's not my job as shadow chancellor to make everybody happy. My job is to make sure that we've got strong, credible policies which add up and make sense and are costed.' One union leader said Ed Balls would 'give an aspirin a headache' He tried to turn the row to his advantage, adding: ‘If people see some trade union leaders having a go at me because I am saying we have got to be disciplined on spending, tough on pay, put jobs first, rebuild this country and kick-start our recovery for the future, I think most people would say that's what we'd expect from the Labour leadership and that's what we are going to deliver.’ Unite is now hoping to mobilise hundreds of thousands of people to march against the cuts on October 20. A motion by the Unison union had called on the conference to ‘condemn’ the pay freeze which has hit millions of public sector workers. But in an attempt to spare the leadership embarrassment, the wording was watered down to ‘note’ the pay freeze. It condemns the fact that most of the lowest paid have not received a promised £250 pay rise. Later Mr Balls called for the £3billion raised by selling off 4G mobile phone licences to be used to build 100,000 affordable homes and offer a stamp duty tax break for first-time buyers. But there is still confusion about whether Labour will commit to the coalition's spending plans, and whether any of the spending pledges made this week will still be policy by the time of the 2015 election. Labour has announced promises to break up the banks, reverse the cut in the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p and spend billions on new homes. But Mr Balls told BBC News: 'I can make no commitment now to reverse any of those cuts or the tax rises, because we don’t know what economy’s going to be like in two months time, let alone in two years’ time when the election comes. 'I’m going to say today we will have a zero budget review when we look at every pound that is spent and say ‘is it being spent well, can we make the savings’, that’s what I think people would expect us to say.'","Shadow chancellor says it is not his job to be popular .

The number of confirmed cases of measles in the Swansea epidemic has risen to 588, health officials in Wales said today. The latest figures show that 40 new cases of the disease have been diagnosed since Wednesday. Up to 20 new cases a day are being reported by GPs, with 109 new ones in a week over the Easter period. Health officials have estimated around 3,800 children in the Swansea area have still not had the MMR vaccine and parents are being asked to act. With cases of measles continuing to soar, parents are being urged to get their children vaccinated . Special vaccination clinics have been arranged for this weekend, as fears grow about the virus spreading to neighbouring areas. Dr Marion Lyons, Director of Health Protection for Public Health Wales, said: 'The alarming numbers of cases of measles and continuing spread of the disease in Wales illustrates how vital it is for parents to get their children vaccinated. 'Unvaccinated children aged between six and 12 months living in or travelling to the outbreak areas of Swansea and Neath Port Talbot can be offered vaccination by their GP. 'There's no adverse effect to this extra jab and those children would still need to receive the recommended two doses at 13 months and three years four months.' Dr Lyons added that increasing numbers of people coming forward for the MMR vaccination was encouraging - with just under 600 people in the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board area alone receiving an unscheduled MMR vaccine in the past seven days. 'We are really pleased to see that 586 people have proactively got the MMR vaccine over the past week, on top of those already scheduled to have it,' she added. 'Though this is a good start, there are still thousands of children who have not had both doses of the MMR jab and so are still at risk from becoming infected with the potentially fatal measles virus. ‘The risk to unvaccinated children in Wales is increasing as the disease . spreads. The number of confirmed cases of measles (pictured) in the Swansea epidemic has risen to 588, Public Health Wales has confirmed . 'You only need one or two people who haven't had the . vaccination in a community to put at risk babies, toddlers and anyone . else who is vulnerable, such as children with leukaemia who cannot have . the vaccination and pregnant women who haven't been vaccinated. 'Ninety per cent of children receiving one dose of MMR are very quickly . protected against measles. For those completing the recommended two-dose . course of MMR, 99 per cent of children will be protected against . measles.’ She warned: ‘Their health is dependent on those with whom they have . close contact being fully protected against measles so that it cannot . spread to them. ‘The current pattern of cases and spread of illness indicates that this . outbreak is likely to continue into the summer months and the risks to . unvaccinated individuals will increase as more people become infected. ‘Protection against the risk of measles by getting MMR vaccination is safe, simple and effective.' Drop-in MMR vaccination clinics are being held by Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board between 10am and 4pm on Saturday April 6 at Morriston Hospital, Singleton Hospital, the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend and the Paediatric Outpatients at Neath Port Talbot Hospital. No appointments are necessary.

This week's Eastleigh by-election was triggered by the resignation as MP of Chris Huhne who pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice . Nick Clegg today pleaded with voters to not punish the Liberal Democrats for Chris Huhne's lies, ahead of the crucial Eastleigh by-election. With polls showing the contest is on course for a photo finish, Mr Clegg made a whistlestop visit to the constituency of his former Cabinet colleague who quit as an MP after pleading guilty to perverting the course of justice. The Lib Dem leader tried to argue Mr Huhne's private life should not overshadow his achievements as a local MP. 'It’s really important to say this, by the way, everyone wants to give Chris Huhne a kicking,' he told BBC Radio Solent. 'But actually people are telling me locally, whatever he might have done in court, whatever might have happened with his marriage, he was a really excellent local MP who worked with an excellent Liberal Democrat team.' Mr Clegg's attempts to use interviews with local media in Hampshire to drum up support ahead of Thursday's vote were overshadowed by the growing scandal of his handling of allegations of inappropriate behaviour by former Lib Dem chief executive Lord Rennard. Mr Clegg insisted today he had 'nothing to hide' after admitting he knew of non-specific allegations made by women five years ago. The Lib Dems had been on course to win the Eastleigh seat, but as the Rennard scandal exploded the polls have narrowed with the Tories now ahead. Support for the UK Independence Party is also growing, suggesting the crunch vote on Thursday could turn into a three-cornered fight. According to a Survation poll published yesterday the Conservatives have a narrow lead of four percentage points over the Lib Dems, reversing recent findings that gave Nick Clegg’s party a similar advantage. Support for the Tories is now 33 per cent with the Lib Dems on 29. A previous survey by Populus, published on Saturday, put the Lib Dems five points ahead. Write caption here . According to the Survation poll, a surge in Ukip support has seen them rise to 21 per cent, eight points clear of Labour, who seem destined for a humiliating fourth place. The by-election has been billed as a ‘must-win’ for both Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg. Tory activists have privately expressed pessimism about the prospects of their candidate Maria Hutchings after receiving a hostile reception on doorsteps. Ukip’s performance is bad news for David Cameron since it suggests the Tories risk losing seats across Britain where the Eurosceptic party is leeching votes away from the Conservatives. Ukip may even be within striking . distance of their first by-election win. The Populus poll put the Lib . Dem candidate, Mike Thornton, on 33 per cent, with the Tories on 28 per . cent and Ukip on 21 per cent. But analysis by UK Polling Report’s . Anthony Wells revealed that those numbers included allocating ‘don’t . know’ responses based on how participants voted in 2010 - votes that may . not be repeated in the by-election. The International Consortium of British Pensioners' today unveiled a billboard in Eastleigh protesting against the Lib Dems' position on pensions paid to UK pensioners who choose to live abroad . Mr Wells said if those ‘don’t knows’ are discounted, the Lib Dems are only on 31 per cent, the Tories on 26 . per cent and Ukip close behind on 25 per cent. Ken Clarke, now minister without . portfolio, said it would not be a surprise if the Tories lost. ‘I always . prefer to win by-elections but governments don’t usually win . by-elections,’ he said. ‘If we do lose it, it can hardly be . said that it’s too surprising given we are mid-term, facing difficult . problems and obviously this is regarded as essentially a Conservative . government.’ Tory sources say Marta Andreasen, the . former Ukip MEP who defected to the Conservatives, will be wheeled out . tomorrow in a bid to win back votes. Grant Shapps and Michael Gove will . also travel to Eastleigh this week. But in a sign that Tories may regard the seat as lost, David Cameron will not be returning.","Lib Dem leader insists despite scandal Huhne was 'excellent local MP'

Two men have today been arrested by Jimmy Savile detectives on suspicion of sexual offences as part of Operation Yewtree. The duo have been taken into custody after one was arrested at an address in Hampshire and another in west London. The two men have been arrested under the strand of the investigation labelled 'others' as detective sort through hundreds of accusations made after the revelations about the late disgraced Jimmy Savile. The pair have been arrested as police investigate accusations made in the wake of revalations about disgraced Jimmy Savile . A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'Officers working on Operation Yewtree have today arrested two men on suspicion of sexual offences. 'A 53-year-old man ('Yewtree 9') was arrested at approximately 8am at an address in Hampshire and taken into custody locally. 'A 59-year-old man ('Yewtree 10') was arrested at approximately midday in west London and taken into custody at a London police station. 'Both individuals fall under the strand of the investigation we have termed 'others'. 'We are not prepared to discuss further.' Held: Ted Beston was arrested by police  and bailed . The force is leading the national . probe into claims made against the disgraced TV presenter and figures in . the entertainment industry. The . arrests come after former BBC producer Ted Beston 'vehemently denied' claims that he molested young women while working for Jimmy Savile. Mr Beston, 76, was arrested by Operation Yewtree detectives in December last year on suspicion of historic sexual offences. In . a statement released through his lawyers on December 20, the former . Radio 1 producer said he was shocked by the allegations and had not . known about Savile's revolting abuse. The producer, nicknamed 'Uncle' Ted by Savile on air, was bailed until February. Mr Beston, 76, was held at his home in Bromley, South London, at 6.30am and taken to a police station . He became a close friend of Savile’s while working for years as his producer on Radio 1 on shows including Savile’s Travels. Beston is accused of procuring girls for Savile and other men to molest in the 1960s and 1970s. Some women have also claimed that he sexually assaulted them himself. He was the eighth man to be arrested as part of Operation Yewtree, the Savile sex abuse investigation. Mr Beston produced several shows for Savile and also used his skills producing hit shows for DJ Mike Read and latterly Simon Mayo's Breakfast Show in the 80s. At the time a police spokesman said: 'The man, who is in his 70s and from London, was arrested at 06.30hrs on . suspicion of sexual offences and taken into custody at a south London . police station.

Gary Glitter (right) was arrested and bailed in October . In . some cases victims will not be identified or press charges. But in at . least a dozen cases, police are reported to believe there is enough . evidence for the celebrities to be arrested. The . investigation has three strands, one dealing with allegations directly . involving Jimmy Savile, the second involving allegations against . associates of the disgraced DJ and the third involving 'others'. Operation Yewtree has already cost around £2million and involves a team of 30 officers. In December a man from London in his 60s was arrested on suspicion of sexual offences. PR guru Max Clifford was arrested earlier on suspicion of sexual offences but was later bailed as part of the probe. A man aged in his 80s from Berkshire was interviewed by detectives three weeks ago. Gary Glitter, comedian Freddie Starr, DJ Dave Lee Travis and a man in his 70s, reported to be former television producer Wilfred De'Ath, have been arrested and bailed as part of the probe. On Monday, Starr and Clifford were re-bailed to return on dates in February and March pending further inquiries. Officers are looking at claims against Savile, those against Savile and others, and those against others. Police revealed a total of 31 allegations of rape have been made against Jimmy Savile. Detectives said they had received 199 complaints of sex attacks against the late BBC star from 450 different people. Savile is said to have carried out the attacks in 17 police force areas.

"By . Jaya Narain and James Tozer . PUBLISHED: . 20:38 EST, 28 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 20:38 EST, 28 November 2012 . A decision not to prosecute Cyril Smith in the 1960s over allegations of sexual abuse left him free to prey on other children, it was claimed yesterday. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) admits it should have prosecuted the politician over accusations of abuse towards the end of the 60s. But fresh claims emerged yesterday that the 29-stone MP sexually abused boys at a second children’s home as late as 1980. Horrific: Chris Marshall, right, said he was just seven or eight when he was sexually abused by Cyril Smith, left, at a notorious school for vulnerable boys . Chris Marshall said he was just seven or eight when he was sexually abused by Smith at a notorious school for vulnerable boys. Mr Marshall, now 40, moved into Knowl View in Rochdale in 1979. Just months later, he says, he was forced to perform a sex act on Smith – known to the pupils as ‘the fat man’ – after being ‘summoned’ from his dormitory in the dead of night. He said: ‘A member of staff came up and took me from the room. He took me into this flat. The fat man was on the bed and another kid was there too. ‘We were told to go back afterwards to our rooms, not to wake anybody else up and have a good breakfast in the morning. ‘It was a dreadful, dreadful experience but I was so confused I didn’t tell anyone until much later. But the school was rife with this type of behaviour and there were all sorts of sexual things going on.’ After the abuse, he begged staff for his own room. When he got his wish, he slept with a chair against the door so no-one could get in. Request: Simon Danczuk, Labour MP for Rochdale, said it would be 'helpful' if Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, pictured, withdrew the tribute he paid to Smith on his death in 2010 . Mr Marshall said that it was only when he was in his teens and saw photos of the high-profile politician in a newspaper that he realised who his abuser was. He said: ‘It was definitely Cyril Smith. The truth is he was a child abuser and targeted vulnerable children. People need to know this is what he was – he was a paedophile.’ Mr Marshall has since made a complaint to police and hopes his actions will encourage other victims to come forward. A social worker blew the whistle on the behaviour at Knowl View – which closed in 1992 – and police launched an investigation. In September 2002, David Higgins, a former teacher, pleaded guilty to 11 counts of indecent assault and gross indecency. Smith, who was a Liberal then Liberal Democrat MP from 1972-92, was a governor at the troubled school though he was not looked at as part of those probes. On Tuesday the CPS admitted Smith, who was a Labour councillor in the 1950s and 60s, should have been charged with sex crimes more than 40 years ago. Instead, in March 1970, the Director of Prosecution, Norman Skelhorn, wrote to Lancashire Police saying he would not advise prosecution. The CPS said procedural changes meant a prosecution would have been pursued today. Simon Danczuk, Labour MP for Rochdale, said: ‘I am confident in saying, having met a number of the victims, that he went on to abuse into the 70s, 80s and even into the 90s, so he was empowered by the fact that he hadn’t been prosecuted.’ Mr Danczuk added that it would be ‘helpful’ if Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg withdrew the tribute he paid to Smith on his death in 2010. Mr Clegg said at the time: ‘Cyril Smith was a larger-than-life character and one of the most recognisable and likeable politicians of his day. Everybody in Rochdale knew him, not only as their MP but also as a friend.’ Last night a Lib Dem spokesman said: ‘Nick Clegg, like the whole of the party, is horrified by these allegations. Clearly, if he had been aware of them, he would not have made previous positive comments about Cyril Smith and strongly disassociates himself from them.’ Yesterday it emerged former prime minister Tony Blair’s personal priest will be questioned by police over Knowl View. In 2007, Father Michael Seed, 55, wrote a book, in which he detailed sexual abuse in the school where he had been a pupil. He was unavailable for comment last night.","Chris Marshall said he was just seven or eight when he was sexually abused by Smith at a notorious school for vulnerable boys .

Four soldiers killed a former comrade and his girlfriend who they thought had betrayed their  anarchist militia group, a court heard today. Members of the group, who were charged with the murders in March, had stockpiled assault weapons and plotted to attack the government and assassinate the President, prosecutors told a judge ahead of their hearing on Thursday. The secret organization was composed of active . duty and former U.S. military members who spent at least $87,000 buying guns . and bomb components and was serious enough to kill two people. Former . soldier Michael Roark and his 17-year-old girlfriend, Tiffany York were executed in the woods  last December in order to keep its plans . secret. On trial: Sgt Anthony Peden (left) and Private Isaac Aguigui (right) are led away after appearing at court last December in Georgia. They are accused of murdering another soldier and his girlfriend to keep their militia's plans secret . 'This domestic terrorist organization did not simply plan and talk,' prosecutor Isabel Pauley told a superior court judge in  rural Long County, near the sprawling Army post Fort Stewart, southeast Georgia. 'Prior to the murders in this case, the group took action. Evidence shows the group possessed the knowledge, means and motive to carry out their plans.' One of the Fort Stewart soldiers charged in the case, Army Pfc. Michael Burnett, also gave testimony that backed up many of the assertions made by prosecutors. The 26-year-old soldier pleaded guilty on Monday to manslaughter, illegal gang activity and other charges. He made a deal to cooperate with prosecutors in their case against three other soldiers. Prosecutors said the group called itself F.E.A.R. - short for Forever Enduring Always Ready. Pauley said authorities don't know how many members the militia had. Burnett, 26, said he knew the group's leaders from serving with them at Fort Stewart. He agreed to testify against fellow soldiers Pvt. Isaac Aguigui, identified by prosecutors as the militia's founder and leader, Sgt. Anthony Peden and Pvt. Christopher Salmon. All are charged by state authorities with malice murder, felony murder, criminal gang activity, aggravated assault and using a firearm with committing a felony. A hearing for the three soldiers was scheduled for Thursday. Prosecutors say Roark, 19, served with the four defendants in the 4th Brigade Combat Team of the Army's 3rd Infantry Division and became involved with the militia. Pauley said the group believed it had been betrayed by Roark, who left the Army two days before he was killed, and decided the ex-soldier and his girlfriend needed to be silenced. Victims: Michael Roark, 19, and Tiffany York, 17, were found shot in the head near Fort Stewart in December . Burnett testified that on the night . of December 4, he and the three other soldiers lured Roark and York to . some woods a short distance from the Army post under the guise that they . were going target shooting. He . said Peden shot Roark's girlfriend in the head while she was trying to . get out of her car. Salmon, he said, made Roark get on his knees and . shot him twice in the head. Burnett said Aguigui ordered the killings. 'A loose end is the way Isaac put it,' Burnett said. Aguigui's . attorney, Daveniya Fisher, did not immediately return a phone call. Attorneys for Peden and Salmon both declined to comment on Monday. Also charged in the killings is Salmon's wife, Heather Salmon. Her attorney, Charles Nester, did not immediately return a call seeking comment. Pauley said Aguigui funded the militia using $500,000 in insurance and benefit payments from the death of his pregnant wife a year ago. Aguigui was not charged in his wife's death, but Pauley told the judge her death was 'highly suspicious'. She said Aguigui used the money to buy $87,000 worth of semiautomatic assault rifles, other guns and bomb components that were recovered from the accused soldiers' homes and from a storage locker. He also used the insurance payments to buy land for his militia group in Washington state, Pauley said. In a videotaped interview with military investigators, Pauley said, Aguigui called himself 'the nicest cold-blooded murderer you will ever meet'. Defendants: Private First Class Michael Burnett (right) is testifying against his colleagues including Private Christopher Salmon (left) He used the Army to recruit militia members, who wore distinctive tattoos that resemble an anarchy symbol, she said. Prosecutors say they have no idea how many members belong to the group. 'All members of the group were on active-duty or were former members of the military,' Pauley said. 'He targeted soldiers who were in trouble or disillusioned.' The prosecutor said the militia group had big plans. It plotted to take over Fort Stewart by seizing its ammunition control point and talked of bombing the Forsyth Park fountain in nearby Savannah, she said. In Washington state, she added, the group plotted to bomb a dam and poison the state's apple crop. Ultimately, prosecutors said, the militia's goal was to overthrow the government and assassinate the president. The Army brought charges against the four accused soldiers in connection with the slayings of Roark and York in March, but has yet to act on them. Fort Stewart spokesman Kevin Larson said he could not comment immediately on the militia accusations that emerged in civilian court Monday. District Attorney Tom Durden said his office has been sharing information with federal authorities, but no charges have been filed in federal court. Jim Durham, an assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Georgia, would not comment on whether a case is pending.","Michael Roark and girlfriend Tiffany York, 17, lured to woods and shot dead 'to tie up loose ends'

An eleven-year-old boy has admitted the rape of a six-year-old girl near his home in North Wales. The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, also admitted three charges of sexual assault by touching and one of common assault on the six-year-old girl when he appeared at Llandudno Youth Court. Last week the boy, from Gwynedd, in North Wales, had denied the charges when he appeared at Caernarfon Youth Court. The 11-year-old schoolboy, from Gwynedd, in North Wales, admitted raping a six-year-old girl when he appeared at Llandudno Youth Court . But yesterday District Judge Andrew Shaw was told there had been discussions between the boy's parents, his solicitor and his doctor which had led to a change of plea. Defence solicitor Nicola Jones said: 'After very lengthy discussions with his doctor, who has known him for many years, it became clear there was nothing medically that could have caused this type of behaviour. 'I have spoken at length with the boy and his parents and advised them of the consequences of a guilty plea and the decision they have taken, on the basis of my advice, is that he will plead guilty to all the charges.' The boy was accompanied at yesterday's hearing by his father and grandmother. His dad held him close during the ten minute hearing. A two-day trial due for March is not now needed the judge ruled. Adjourning the matter for the preparation of reports the judge said: 'It's an extremely difficult case.' No details of the charges were outlined in court yesterday but at the previous hearing the court heard that he is said to have told the girl to accompany him to a nearby pond to see some fish. At that spot he is said to have asked the girl to perform a sex act on him, the basis of the rape charge. It was also alleged he pushed her causing her to fall into the shallow pond. The offences, which happened last August, came to light when the girl returned home crying, soaking wet and covered in mud and told her mother what had happened. The judge allowed the boy conditional bail until the next hearing.

If politics is showbusiness for ugly people, these are the A-listers who became screen stars in the last 12 months - and not always for the right reasons. This year might have seen the Leveson report published, police and crime commissioners elected and the eurozone crisis grinding on. But for most people the year in politics will be best remembered for the omnishambles budget, a certain top Tory caught on a zip-wire and Nadine Dorries' campaign bus rolling into the I'm A Celebrity jungle. Here we count down the 10 most memorable political videos of 2012, proving that the people running the country are as hapless as the rest of us. 10. David Cameron and Boris Johnson throw some shapes . With . the world looking on, London 2012 organisers decided to wind up the . Olympics with a reunion of the Spice Girls singing atop a fleet of black . cabs. But that was not the . most excruciating moment. Oh no. The honour goes to the Prime Minister . and Mayor of London for taking joint gold for Olympic Dad Dancing. 9. Andrew Mitchell's 'long and frustrating day' We may never find out what Andrew Mitchell really said to police on that fateful September night when he was told he could not ride his bike through the gates of Downing Street. Forced to quit as Chief Whip over claims he called police 'f****** plebs' he has seized on CCTV footage which appears to contradict the official police log of the incident. But far more entertaining was his public apology for the cameras in September, including his claim that he had had a 'long and frustrating day' which it later emerged involved lunch at one of Westminster's most expensive curry houses. 8. David Cameron's pasty omnishambles . You know things are bad for the government when spin doctors decide footage of the PM playing badminton is the best distraction. Sadly David Cameron's prowess with a shuttlecock failed to deflect attention from the Budget omnishambles, which proposed hiking VAT on hot pasties. With Labour MPs posing awkwardly in bakeries to capitalise on the growing public backlash, the Premier was challenged to say when he last ate one of Cornwall's finest. His answer in March soon unraveled, when it turned out the shop in Leeds had shut down two years earlier. 7. Ed Miliband asks: 'Is that a lady or a man?' Allies of the Labour leader say he is the right man for the job because he can identify with the average voter. But in March Ed Miliband was unable to identify even the gender of a member of the audience at a Q&A session. Even the beard was not a big enough clue. 6. 'Is this some sort of joke?' Jeremy Paxman mauls Chloe Smith . Newsnight interviews are tricksy affairs for ministers at the best of times. But when junior Treasury minister Chloe Smith was sent on in June to explain yet another u-turn she knew nothing about, Paxo took no prisoners. She coughed and spluttered her way through the grilling over the surprise announcement that a 3p rise in fuel duty would not now go ahead, but Westminster insiders agreed she had been like a lamb to the slaughter while the Chancellor dined in Downing Street. She was shunted to the Cabinet Office in September's reshuffle. 5. Nadine Dorries finds reality TV hard to swallow . Conservative MP Nadine Dorries claimed her decision in October to swap Westminster for the I'm A Celebrity jungle would give her chance to discuss hot topics like lowering the abortion limit in front of an audience of millions. Instead the Mid Bedfordshire MP was seen eating camel toe in a Bushtucker Trial against Helen Flanagan from Corrie. The first celeb to be kicked out in a public vote, Ms Dorries was then suspended from the Tory party and has still not been let back in. 4. 60,000 Paralympics fans tell George Osborne what they think of him . The Chancellor always predicted he would become unpopular as the cuts started to bite. But he probably did not expect the public to voice their disapproval as he gave out medals at the Paralympic Games in August. Surprisingly, Mr Osborne appears to laugh, almost as if he is enjoying it. 3. Boris Johnson's high wire act goes wrong . The Mayor of London became the undisputed non-sporting star of London 2012 - from trying his hand at sitting volleyball to taking a ride in a cable car with Arnold Schwarzenegger. But it was the moment a pre-Olympics stunt on a zipwire went wrong for which he will be best remembered, making him an internet hit around the world. Amazingly, the flag-waving, whiff-whaff-playing Old Etonian was later named Britain's most respected politician. 2. Nick Clegg's apology hits the charts . There was a time when Nick Clegg was more popular in the polls than Churchill. Then effigies of the Lib Dem leader were burnt in the street and dog's mess was pushed through his letter box. So what does a politician in trouble in the polls do? Record a video message apologising for promising not to increase tuition fees, which is then remixed by satirical website The Poke, before agreeing to its release to raise funds for a children's hospital. It reached 143 in the charts in September. All together now.... 1. Jeremy Hunt's Olympic clanger . Whose idea was it to start the greatest show on earth with nationwide bell-ringing anyway? Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt kicked off the London Olympics in July with a magnificent display of campanology, only slightly hampered by the sight of his ringer flying off and hitting a woman in the crowd on board HMS Belfast. It is even better in slow motion.","Forget the Leveson Inquiry and the eurozone crisis, the last 12 months in politics are best remembered for the howlers .

Japan Airlines has reported a fuel leak in a Boeing 787 Dreamliner for the second time in a week amid a U.S. safety review of the aircraft. Narita International Airport outside of Tokyo says JAL reported a 100-liter fuel leak in a 787 during an inspection Sunday. The aircraft reportedly was the same one that had a fuel leak in Boston last week. Japan's All Nippon Airways has experienced a fuel leak, a cockpit window crack and a computer malfunctioning in its 787s, causing cancellations of several domestic flights. Scroll down for video . High tech: The 787 Dreamliner relies more than any other modern aircraft on electrical signals to help power nearly everything the plane does. But it has suffered a multitude of problems in the last week . The 787 is Boeing's newest and most high-tech airliner. Japanese airlines are among the top 787 customers. The U.S. government said Friday the 787 is safe to fly, although last week federal regulators ordered a comprehensive review last week into the cause of various problems and scares in a matter of days. The Federal Aviation Administration finally launched the probe after a crack appeared in a cockpit window during a domestic All Nippon Airways flight in Japan on Friday. The review is an embarrassing setback . to the plane that was heralded as the future of aviation, after four . separate malfunctions occurred last week alone, including a brake . failure, a fuel leak and an on-board fire. Concern: Last Sunday, another 787 caught fire after dropping off 183 passengers and crew from Tokyo at Boston . Trouble: Last Monday, a fuel leak forced a 787 operated by Japan Airlines to cancel takeoff at Boston's Logan International Airport (pictured: the fire that broke out the day before) The FAA says the review will include the design, manufacture and assembly of the aircraft. Speaking of Friday's incident, ANA . said crew noticed a spider web-like crack in a window in front of the . pilot's seat about 70 minutes into Friday's flight, which was close to . its destination. 'Cracks appear a few times every year . in other planes. We don't see this as a sign of a fundamental problem' with Boeing aircraft, a spokesman for the airline said.

January 7 2013 - A Dreamliner catches fire after dropping . off 183 passengers and crew in Boston when a battery in the . jet's auxiliary power system overheated. The 787, which Boeing calls the Dreamliner, relies more than any other modern airliner on electrical . signals to help power nearly everything the plane does. It is also the first Boeing plane to use rechargeable lithium ion batteries and to be made with lightweight composite materials. More . than 800 have been sold to airlines around the world, which Boeing has . said will be more fuel efficient than comparable jets and more . comfortable for passengers. But the Dreamliner has flown under a . cloud since its maiden voyage on in October 2011, which itself saw . repeated delays lasting more than three years after a slew of faults . were detected. On Wednesday, All Nippon Airlines was forced to cancel . a domestic flight to Tokyo after a computer wrongly . indicated a problem with the 787's brakes.

And a day before that, another Dreamliner caught fire after dropping off 183 passengers and crew from Tokyo at Boston when a battery in the jet's auxiliary power system overheated. Nobody was hurt as passengers and crew had already disembarked. But those were not the only issues that have blemished the much-vaunted launch of air travel's latest addition. In December United Airlines' brand-new Dreamliner, carrying 174 passengers and 10 crew, was forced to make an . emergency landing in New Orleans due to a mechanical issue.

The first class cabin is seen featuring larger windows, special lighting and filtered air throughout the plane . In the same month, Qatar Airways grounded one of its Dreamliners after . several similar faults caused electrical problems. But the airline's image has been besieged by a string of other problems that began long before its inaugural flight. In . July last year, debris from a brand-new Dreamliner's engine sparked a . fire at a South Carolina airport forcing emergency crews to close the . Charleston International Airport for more than an hour. An investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board uncovered cracks in the forward end of a fan midshaft in one of its engines. And an incident in February 2012 saw Boeing report signs of 'delamination' occurring on a support structure in the Dreamliner's rear fuselage, launching an inspection. It is the first large-scale commercial aircraft made 50 per cent from 'composite materials' including plastics and carbon fiber and experts believe it could bring an end to the 'aluminium age'.

David Cameron is to demand an EU-wide crackdown on tax evasion and avoidance to boost revenues . David Cameron will today demand an EU-wide crackdown on tax evasion and avoidance in a bid to boost revenues amid fears the economy is flatlining. He warns that global action is necessary to reclaim the ‘staggering’ amounts of revenue lost through aggressive tax avoidance and evasion. The Prime Minister’s intervention comes as the Government discovers today if Britain plunged into a triple-dip recession in the first three months of the year. Experts are predicting lacklustre growth figures on ‘a day of reckoning’. Mr Cameron will use his chairmanship of the G8 in June to push for a worldwide crackdown on tax avoidance. In a letter to European Union president Jose Manuel Barroso and European Council president Herman van Rompuy, he calls for countries to share information on tax affairs and tough new laws to force companies to reveal where their profits go. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said: ‘In reality, it makes very little difference whether the economy expanded modestly in the first quarter, contracted marginally or was flat. ‘Regardless of whether further GDP contraction was avoided in the first quarter, it is evident that the economy is still finding it tough to generate even modest sustainable growth.’ Tory MPs have privately warned that Mr Osborne will face concerted demands for more action unless growth picks up soon. Yesterday Mark Field, a close ally of Tory leadership hopeful Adam Afriyie, broke cover and accused ministers of being ‘complacent’ about the need for growth and warned that a loss of confidence from the markets would be ‘fatal’ to the coalition. In an interview with London Loves Business, Mr Field said: ‘When it came in, the coalition was pretty complacent about growth. There wasn’t quite the urgency or passion to get things moving at the outset. Mr Cameron has written to European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso (left) and European Council President Herman Van Rompuy (right) to call for countries to share information on tax affairs . ‘We still continue to flunk the decisions on big infrastructure projects like nuclear power. We’ll also fudge through on aviation. I don’t think it’s a very satisfactory situation. ‘Hitherto it has been George Osborne’s great success that the markets have been convinced we have a plan, but if market sentiment were to turn, it could be fatal.’ The Treasury and the Bank of England yesterday outlined plans to supercharge their Funding for Lending Scheme amid fears Britain is heading for a triple dip recession. The beefed-up programme will see banks and other lenders offered £10 of cheap funding for every pound they lend to small business this year and £5 per £1 next year.

Unlucky, Madron FC lost every match last season and conceded a staggering 407 goals. Hammerings included a 16-0 and 27-0 defeat and a rock bottom after a 55-0 drubbing at the hands of local rivals Illogan. Victorious: Some Madron FC players pictured with club secretary Allan Davenport, far right . However, players were celebrating yesterday after chalking up their first win - a 4-3 victory over bottom of the table Storm FC. The Trelawny league team from Penzance, Cornwall, have faired better this season with a goal difference of minus 16 having conceded 22 goals after four games. Club secretary, treasurer and chairman for the last 26 years Alan Davenport said there were huge celebrations at the final whistle when they claimed their 4-3 victory. He said: 'It was a nervy last few minutes and I was terrified they were going to nick an equaliser but fair play to the boys, they held on for the win. 'The lads went crazy at the final whistle, and why not? It was a big win for them. 'Its been a long time coming for this club and was a proud moment. 'I know we were a bit of a laughing stock before but at least we are finally on the up. 'It . was pretty depressing last season. No-one likes to turn up every week . and get thumped and the 55-0 loss was a real low point'. In action: Madron FC player John Spencer, centre, tackling opponents . Mr Davenport put the club's recent success down to an influx of new players after the run of miserable defeats suffered last season. He added: 'We had a lot of interest after last season I think people felt sorry for us and wanted to offer their skills and support. 'There are a few of the lads left over from last season so it meant a great deal to them'. Last season Madron FC lost their opening matches 11-0, 4-1 and 16-0 before going down to heavier defeats. In November they suffered the humiliating defeat of 55-0 to Illogan with one opposition player bagging ten goals. Despite this, Mr Davenport still awarded each player a trophy at the end of the season because the team did not have to cancel a single game.

A hairdresser who says she can hear what people's pets are 'saying' is being paid up to £100 a time by worried owners. Real-ife Dr Dolittle Mandy Carr, 39, claims to have an unusual affinity with animals that helps her know what they are 'saying' or feeling. Mrs Carr, from Sheffield, says she can even channel messages from dead pets, and claims to have helped diagnose a dog in Australia with kidney problems. Psychic powers: Mandy Carr is paid by worried pet owners to channel messages from their animals . She says she first discovered her gift at 20 when she was cutting someone's hair and heard an unusual voice begging for a treat. She said: 'When I realised it was my client's dog, it scared me half to death. I didn't know if I was normal or mad. 'I only have to look at a pet's picture and I can feel their ailments and listen to whatever they choose to tell me - which often includes telling tales on their owners. 'I'll be driving and I'll hear one of my clients' cats and I'll think to myself ""Oh blimey not now"", but unfortunately I can't decide when they need me.' Mrs Carr was born deaf and wears two hearing aids, but says she has always had a special connection with animals and belives being deaf has heightened her psychic powers. She claims she can link in with dead pets to pass on messages from beyond the grave, describing herself as a 'channeller between two worlds'. Unusual affinity: Mrs Carr treats more than 1,500 animals a year . Don't bottle it up: The Sheffield hairdresser treats reptiles as well as the fluffier variety of pets . For £100, Mrs Carr, who says she donates most of her earnings to animal charities, will stay with a beloved pet in its dying hours and fulfil its final requests. The pet psychic also says her powers can work long-range: recently she was contacted by the owners of a sickly golden retriever in Australia. Mrs Carr managed to 'diagnose' a kidney complaint and help the dog, Nala, overcome rejection fears after her owners split up later. When Nala died Mrs Carr was also able to connect to her on the 'spirit plane' and let her owner know she was OK. Mrs Carr says that sometimes the pets want to tell tales on their owners .

The widow of Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev left her parents home wearing a traditional Muslim headscarf today - countering reports that she has turned her back on her adopted religion. Katherine Russell, or Karima Tsarnaeva by her married name, is living at her . parents' home in Rhode Island with her daughter by the terrorist. According to reports, her Christian parents have been encouraging her to turn her back on the religion she adopted when she married Tsarnaev, a Chechen who encouraged his wife to join him in a strict interpretation of his faith. Traditional dress: Katherine Russell was photographed this morning wearing a Muslim headscarf . Moving on? Katherine Russell (left), the widow of suspected Boston bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev (right), was yesterday said to be rejecting the Muslim faith she adopted when she married him . However, the 24-year-old countered any suggestion they had won her over today - leaving their suburban home fully covered and wearing a headscarf. A report by the National Enquirer earlier this week said she had been been turned away from the religion since her husband's death in the bombings he allegedly perpetuated alongside younger brother Dzhokhar. 'Katherine is slowly starting to change,' a source told the National Enquirer, adding that she is already wearing fingernail polish and eating at fast food restaurants. She also changed her name back to Katherine Russell, according to the report. However, if she is converting back to Christianity it is indeed happening slowly, according to her appearance this morning. The young mom was seen getting into a car with her 2-year-old daughter. Daughter: Katherine Russell's little girl, also the daughter of Tamerlan Tsarnaev watched as her grandmother prepared her car seat . Grandmother: Judith Russell, Katherine Russell's mother was pictured loading her granddaughter in the car . Covered up: Reports previously claimed the widow of Tamerlan Tsarnaev was giving up her adopted religion in the wake of her death and terror attack on Boston . Her mother Judith loaded the vehicle with a child seat wearing a t-shirt and shorts. Katherine then emerged wearing sunglasses, carrying her keys and a can of soda cutting a stark contrast to her mother's summery look with her body fully covered in a floor length purple skirt and black long sleeve jumper. It had previously been reported that she drastically changed after meeting Tsarnaev while at a club during her college years. 'Katherine was completely sub­servient to him,' a source told the Enquirer. 'She cowered around him.' She is cooperating with officials in . the investigation, but claims she had no idea her husband was plotting . to bomb the Boston marathon as she was working 80 hours a week as a . health care aide. She has not been accused of any . wrongdoing, but the FBI have questioned her to find out if . she had any clue as to her husband's plans. Widow: Katherine Russell is pictured three days after her husband was killed following a police shootout . Innocence: Katherine's family are trying to get her to convert back to Christianity, as in her school days, according to reports . The bombing at the marathon's finish line on April 15 killed three people and injured more than 260. Tsarnaev . and his brother Dzhokhar are believed to . have carried out the attacks due to their radical jihadist beliefs. Her lawyer Joshue Dratel, from New York, said that he joined Russell's legal team . to help her navigate the criminal justice system and to protect her . interests. He said she had spoken with investigators and planned to keep co-operating. 'I . don't see that changing in the foreseeable future,' he said. 'There's . no inconsistency between that and her interests at this point.' She was widowed when Tamer­lan was killed in a police shootout on April 19 – four days after he and his younger brother Dzhokhar allegedly set off bombs during the Boston Marathon. Three people were killed in the cowardly attack and 264 more were wounded, sev­eral of whom lost limbs.

Two U.S. officials have said that Dzhokhar told investigators the bombs were assembled in the small apartment Russell shared with her husband. One of her lawyers has previously said she was working long hours and was frequently away from the apartment.","Tamerlan Tsarnaev's widow left her home with her head covered in a scarf this morning .

Anticipation of the return of Twinkies to supermarket shelves this month has been marred by the decision to freeze them as it could threaten the product’s integrity. The freezing of the popular all-American pastries has been confirmed by the manufacturer company, Hostess Brands Inc, which said in a statement to Huff Post Business that the decision was made due to requests from their retail customers. The statement said it will allow the retailers to ‘date the product for freshness’ while giving them ‘flexibility in filling their shelves’. Frozen treat: Some of the new Twinkies will be frozen and then defrosted before they reach the shelves . Back on shelves: The last Twinkie was snapped up in 2012, but they are back again on July 15 . The plan is to bake the goodies at five plants and freeze them before . shipping them through independent drivers to supermarket warehouses, . according to sources. Stores would defrost them and restock the shelves as needed. However, according to the New York Post, some people fear the new freezing process could threaten the product’s future popularity and integrity. A common urban legend claims that Twinkies - a sponge cake with white creamy filling - have an infinite shelf life, or can last unspoiled for a relatively long time, due to the chemicals used in their production. This urban legend is false, although Twinkies can last a relatively long time because they are made without dairy products and thus spoil more slowly than most bakery items. Twinkies are in fact on the shelf for a short time, according to a company executive who told the New York Times in 2000 that the Twinkie is on the shelf 'no more than 7 to 10 days'. Twinkies' myth of having a long shelf life has been referenced in films and television shows such as Die Hard, WALL-E, Zombieland, Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance, and Family Guy. End of an era: Gregory Rayburn, CEO of Hostess Brands Inc. which makes Twinkies, filed for bankruptcy in early 2012 . Iconic: Twinkies will be back on shelves this month as per popular demand . But Hostess denies the decision to freeze the cakes before they hit the shelves will have any impact. ‘Any suggestion that Hostess is changing the integrity of the iconic snack cakes consumers have loved is completely untrue,’ said Hostess spokeswoman, Hannah Arnold. ‘The new ownership is absolutely committed to baking top quality snack cakes and, in fact, is making major investments to ensure that Hostess products are as good, if not even better, than before,’ she said. Hostess filed for bankruptcy in early 2012, after an acrimonious fight with its unionised workers last year. It is now back up and running under new owners and a leaner structure under investment firm Metropoulos & Co. who swooped in to buy Twinkies and other Hostess snacks in 2013. Based on the outpouring of nostalgia sparked by its demise, Hostess is expecting a blockbuster when it returns to shelves on July 15 with its Twinkies and other sugary treats, such as CupCakes and Donettes. The Twinkie was invented in Illinois, in 1930.","The sponge cake will be frozen and then defrosted before it hits shelves for those retailers who request it .

A French commando raid aimed at freeing a hostage from Al Qaeda warlords ended in disaster yesterday as one soldier was killed and another was reported missing. There were reports that the man they were attempting to free in war-torn Somalia had been shot dead – a claim denied by those holding him. French special forces arrived in the village of Bulo Marer, 50 miles from the capital Mogadishu, in the early hours. Scroll down for video . Rescue bid: Despite earlier claims French secret agent Denis Allex had been killed, Al-Shabab insisted he was still alive but now plan to 'execute' him . Their mission was to free Denis Allex, the pseudonym for a secret agent who was captured in the east African country in 2009 while working for France’s overseas intelligence agency DGSE. Denis Allex appeared in videos aimed at the French government pleading for help to set him free.His first appeal in 2010, a year after he was captured, saw him call on then-President Nicolas Sarkozy to drop French support for the Somali government, for whom he had been training soldiers before he was held.Then, in July 2012, looking gaunt, he sent a video message to new President Francois Hollande, telling how his hopes of a rescue were fading by the day.He calls on France to drop its 'oppressive attitude' towards Muslims and says Mr Hollande represented his last hope of rescue.Poignantly, he adds: 'I am alive. But for how long?' However, within minutes of arriving, the commandos were involved in a firefight that saw a soldier killed. Up to 17 Somalis were killed in scenes reminiscent of the battle of Mogadishu in 1993, which is commonly referred to as Black Hawk Down  after a book and film about the incident. Then, a US army force  tried to seize Somali warlords in the city but two UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters  were shot down, resulting  in the deaths and wounding of 18 Americans, and up to  3,000 Somalis. Those involved in yesterday’s attack were members of militant  Islamist group Al-Shabab,  the Somalian representatives of Al Qaeda. French defence minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said: ‘A French commando was killed and another is missing.’ Despite earlier French claims about Mr Allex being killed, Al-Shabab insisted he was still alive – and had not even been in the village. In a statement, the group said it had ‘killed several’ French soldiers and that Mr Allex was ‘safe and far from the location of the battle’. Mr Allex has appeared in propaganda videos since his capture, pleading for his release and for France to change its stance. French special forces arrived in the village of Bulo Marer, 50 miles from the capital Mogadishu, in the early hours of Saturday January 12 . Taunting: A member of militant islamist group Al Shabab, which control much of southern Somalia (file photo) French Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian confirmed the failed mission to rescue Denis Allex . The failed raid came just a few hours . after France began a military operation in Mali to assist the government . there against encroaching rebels linked to Al Qaeda. It was formed as a radical offshoot of the Union of Islamic Courts in 2006. Affiliated to al-Qaeda, it controls large swathes of south and central Somalia and in 2010 it was responsible for the deaths of 76 people in a double attack in Uganda during 2010 football World Cup. It is estimated to have 7,000 to 9,000 fighters. al-Shabab means 'The Youth' in Arabic. A French combat . pilot was killed in the country yesterday. However, Mr Le Drian insisted that the .

Active: Despite playing a range of sports, 11-year-old Katie Lee has been classed as overweight by a government programme . Aged 11, Katie Lee is a  picture of health – and sporty to boot with a love for hockey and hiking with her fellow Scouts. But the NHS scheme that monitors primary school children’s weight bizarrely believes  that she is fat. Katie’s mother Emma was outraged when she received a letter describing her daughter, who stands 5ft 5in tall and weighs 9st 10lb, as ‘overweight’. Former nurse Mrs Lee, 34, described the scheme as ‘ridiculous’, saying it leaves girls feeling ‘sensitive’ about their weight and prone to eating disorders. She said: ‘I was so cross when I got the letter. ‘Katie’s tall and slim – far from overweight. They tell you she is overweight when obviously she’s not – she is very athletic. ‘The first thing she said when she saw the letter is “I’m not fat”. They also sent me a healthy eating leaflet, like I couldn’t look after my children. 'They hadn’t even seen my daughter. This is the sort of thing that gives young girls eating disorders. She is at a vulnerable, impressionable age, getting ready to leave primary school. ‘She is very fit and active, she takes the dogs out for a walk in the mornings and walks to meet friends. She is also in the Scouts and hikes for miles at the weekend. She plays hockey, rounders, touch rugby and does gymnastics.’ Katie was weighed at her primary school for The National Child Measurement Programme, set up in 2005 as part of a government strategy to tackle the growing obesity crisis in young people. Under the scheme, children in their first and last year of primary school are weighed and measured to work out their body mass index, which is calculated by dividing weight in pounds by the square of height in inches. Results are divided into categories labelled ‘underweight’, ‘normal’, ‘overweight’ or ‘very overweight’. But Mrs Lee, who lives with her . greengrocer husband, James, 37, and their children, Liam, 12, Katie and . Lily, six, in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, thinks the Government should . overhaul the scheme. Criticism: Katie's mother, Emma Lee (right) says the programme is leaving girls feeling sensitive about their weight and prone to eating disorders . She said: ‘It’s not compulsory and I think the parents of overweight children may opt out of doing it, so whatever the results are being used for the system is flawed. ‘I think there needs to be something else, not just weighing and measuring, maybe that’s OK in reception but by Year 6 children’s bodies are changing with puberty. ‘It’s just not black and white, there is a lot of grey.’ Mrs Lee is not alone in her anger  at NCMP. A survey carried out by the Institute of Education found more than half of parents whose children were classed as ‘overweight’ did not agree with the findings. The 2010 research found that 53 per cent either disagreed or strongly disagreed with results that their children were fat. One mother surveyed said: ‘You have said that my son is 1 lb overweight, but as long as my son is happy and healthy that is all that matters, and do you realise that with your comments you could cause people to panic and reduce their intake and cause anorexia.’ A spokesman for Public Health England said: ‘The measurement process is overseen by trained healthcare professionals in schools. ‘The children are weighed and measured and their BMI is then calculated by internationally recognised tables. We do not comment on individual cases.’","Health police told 11-year-old Katie Lee that she was overweight .

'I couldn't even imagine if this were to happen to... one of my little cousins... I just want this to be the last time this happens here,' she told KHOU11. Speaking about police searching people for drugs, Brandy Hamilton said, 'If it comes to that, then take the person into jail, you don't have to do it on the side of the road.' 'It's been traumatizing,' she said. 'I don't know if I can trust the cops anymore, it's just been very - a very horrific situation to me.' The women are suing the Texas . Department of Public Safety and the sheriff of Brazoria County, Texas, . where the stop occurred. Their lawyer alleges that the search was meant . to humiliate them and was conducted without probable cause. The . female officer who performed the invasive search, which included inserting a finger into the women's vaginas, is accused of using the same . pair of gloves to search both women. The entire 40-minute traffic stop . was caught on the trooper's dashboard camera.

Booker said a third case, that has yet to become public, bears the same hallmarks, as well. 'How are these people behaving in the same manner, hundreds of miles away from each other. There's got to be some factor at the DPS that makes these officers think they can do this,' she said. Trooper Turner has been suspended as part of an internal investigation by the Department of Public Safety . Miss Hamilton and Miss Randle were on . their way home to Houston from Surfside Beach on May 28, 2012, when they . were stopped for speeding by DPS trooper Nathaniel Turner. Turner . immediately asks both women to step out of their car. Both were wearing . only their two-piece swimsuits from their time at the beach. Ms Hamilton, the driver, asks if she can put her dress on to cover up. 'Don't worry about it. Come out here,' the trooper tells her. Turner . says he can smell marijuana in the car and accuses the women of smoking . and driving. He later claimed that he found a piece of a smoked . marijuana blunt under the back seat of the car. He then makes the two women sand on the side of a busy highway in their swimsuits while he calls for backup. 'One of them has got her zipper open on her pants of her daisy dukes shorts - whatever they are,' the trooper says on the radio. Two more troopers show up - including Jennie Bui. Bui, as trooper Turner explains, 'is going to search you.' 'I ain't, because I ain’t about to get up-close and personal with your woman areas… she is going to put some gloves on,' he says. 'You're going to go up my private parts?' asks Hamilton, sounding bewildered. Despite numerous pleas from the two women not to perform a body cavity search, Bui ignores them. Both women can be seen with pained looks on their faces as the trooper probes their genitals. Both Miss Hamilton (left) and Miss Randel (right) allege their civil rights were violated and they suffered pain and humiliation in the searches . Miss Randle sobs uncontrollably as she is probed. At one point Turner says: 'Don’t smoke weed in your car and you won’t have to go through this.' Booker, the lawyer for the two women, said the behavior of the troopers was outrageous. 'If the cavity search alone isn't enough and say it's their fault that you basically just sexually assaulted them - that's humiliating,' she said. Turner later released both women and issued Miss Hamilton a citation fro possession of drug paraphernalia. She is still fighting the charges in court, though she contends the marijuana wasn't hers. Trooper Bui was fired last week by the DPS. Trooper Turner has been suspended, Booker said. 'These police officers are here to protect and serve,' Brandy Hamilton told KHOU11.

Joyce Moulson's family said in a statement that she was a 'much loved mother', 'adored by those who knew her' and was best known locally for her 'glamorous blonde hair and dress style'. Four schoolboys were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter last night. One of the 13-year-old boys has been released without charge. Another 13-year-old and two 12-year-old boys were released on bail pending further inquiries. Mrs Moulson had been plagued by anti-social youths hanging around on the street outside her home. Mrs Moulson, from Bradford, fell ill at home ten minutes after a window pane on her door had been smashed at her terraced home early on Tuesday evening. She had been having dinner with one of her grandchildren when she collapsed at about 6pm and phoned 999. Neighbours said that the pensioner had been ‘targeted’ by troublemakers. A post mortem conducted on Wednesday night established the cause of death as heart-related illness and further tests are being carried out. Today a statement released by her family told how she was born in Liverpool in 1928 and moved to Bradford when she was a child. The statement read: 'Later marrying her childhood sweetheart John, she began married life in the house where she was to live happily for the rest of her life. 'She was a much loved mother and was adored by those who knew her, both family and friends. 'Generally mum enjoyed good health and for an 84-year-old grandmother she lived an independent life with support from her immediate family.

'On Tuesday evening, she was having dinner with one of her grandchildren when a pane of glass was broken in her front door. Whilst the debris was being cleared she collapsed on the kitchen floor.'

One neighbour, who did not want to be named, said today: 'This area has really gone downhill. On a weekend there are dozens of kids congregating outside the shop just over the road.' Another neighbour said: ‘I was just sat in my living room when I heard the kids outside. ‘But I didn’t think anything of it as I’m just so used to them congregating near our houses. ‘We’ve all had trouble with them in the past and I know this isn’t the first time they’ve targeted Joyce.’ The neighbour added: ‘She was an . absolutely lovely old lady – a really happy, helpful person – a great . neighbour.

Chancellor George Osborne has demanded up to £30billion of extra cuts, but senior ministers are resiting attempts to slice more from their departmental budgets . Tory and Lib Dem ministers are joining forces to oppose protecting pensioner benefits, the NHS and the aid budget from cuts. George Osborne is under pressure to ditch David Cameron’s pledges to protect those areas in the next spending review, so the austerity can be shared more equally. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has calculated that to stop cuts from affecting schools, defence equipment, the NHS and the international development department, other departments would need to make cuts of 35 per cent. One Lib Dem minister told the Mail the Tory decision to ringfence NHS cash is ‘unsustainable’. And senior Conservatives have formed what has been dubbed the ‘National Union of Ministers’ to oppose further cuts in their own budgets. Home Secretary Theresa May and Defence Secretary Philip Hammond have argued cuts to the police and armed forces can go no further. Insiders say they ‘have visibly coordinated’ their complaints in Cabinet meetings – to the irritation of Mr Osborne. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling is also said to want to protect legal aid and Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable has claimed the £10billion cuts demanded by Mr Osborne will lead to disaster. Ministers are growing increasingly angry with the Chancellor’s insistence that health and education are protected, with defence and international development also cushioned from austerity. With the budget just weeks away, ministers are also positioning ahead of negotiations this summer over the spending review for the 2015-16 financial year, which will set spending beyond the next election. Mr Osborne is under pressure after Britain lost its AAA credit rating, amid growing backbench Tory calls for ‘real tax cuts’. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond and Home Secretary Theresa May are resisting further cuts to their departments' budgets . Cabinet ministers were warned today that more progress needed to be made on implementing Local Enterprise Zones . However senior Cabinet ministers are . pushing back against demands for a fresh round of spending cuts . totalling some £30billion, insisting savings could be found from other . areas. David Cameron . promised to protect the health and aid budgets before the last election, . and both parties pledged to shield schools from cuts. He has also vowed to protect pensioner benefits including the winter fuel allowance, bus passes and TV licences. However, . the Lib Dems have insisted it is a policy ‘red line’ that they will not . support further cuts to the welfare budget while universal handouts for . the over-65s are untouched. A . senior government source said: ‘The Treasury are pushing for further . cuts and yet seem to be ringfencing more and more departments.’ Mr Cable is said to be ‘digging his heels in’ to resist any further cuts to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills which he believes is at the coalface of growth agenda. Mr Hammond, who was Mr Osborne’s deputy before the election, is also understood to be opposed resisting further cuts to his defence budget, insisting it was underfunded under Labour. Last week Mr Cameron suggested the foreign aid budget could be used by the MoD if it was connected to humanitarian operations. Business Secretary Vince Cable believes his department should be protected from more cuts, as a key driver of growth . At a Cabinet meeting today, the Prime Minister made clear to minister that there is a ‘real sense of urgency; to the need to boost economic growth. Mr Cameron’s official spokesman said: ‘There was a discussion around the importance of the Government's growth agenda, in particular looking at the work on public sector land sales, broadband, enterprise zones, deregulation, infrastructure projects.’ Ministers are also under pressure to sped up progress in implementing Local Enterprise Zones, which were set up to kickstart regional economies. ‘Progress is being made,’ the spokesman added. ‘The latest figures are about £100m private sector investment has already been attracted by Enterprise Zones. ‘What's important is that we continue with the implementation. As with all the other aspects of the Government's growth agenda, urgency is very much required. ‘The Prime Minister's view is that the Government has been doing the right thing and we need to keep up that momentum and that's what this morning's Cabinet was partly about.’","Senior ministers including Theresa May, Vince Cable and Philip Hammond resisting fresh round of cuts to their departments' budgets .

A millionaire businessman has been ordered to remove an Islamic message from the side of his luxury house because council chiefs say it is advertising, it emerged today. Mahmood Ali, 54, fell out with planners over the wording, taken from the Arabic creed, which reads: 'There is no god but Allah, and Mohammed is his messenger'. Known as shahada, the message declares the belief in the oneness of God and acceptance of Muhammad as his prophet. The inscription, in 2ft-high green lettering, has been placed across a first-floor archway on his large detached house in a residential street. 'Breaches planning laws': Millionaire businessman Mahmood Ali faces a court battle over this Islamic slogan on his house in Newport, South Wales, after the council ordered it be removed because it is 'advertising' But he is now in a legal battle with planning chiefs, who classed it as the same as an advertising hoarding like a McDonald's or Marks & Spencer banner. Mr Ali said: 'The message is simply there to bless the house. The symbols are not an advertisement in any sense of the word's use in daily life. 'I chose the sign's green colour to reflect the ambiance of the property's character and its surroundings.' Mr Ali had the sign placed onto the side of his £750,000 eight-bedroom home in Newport, South Wales. But the city's council later decided he didn't have the right planning permission to display the message across the home's stone archway. The sign, which is around two metres wide and 60cm high, includes the declaration of the Islamic faith, called the Islamic creed. 'Obtrusive': The message, in 2ft-high lettering, is written across a first-floor archway on the large detached house . The message on the side of Mahmood Ali's house comes from the Islamic creed, known as shahada, which declares the belief in the oneness of God and acceptance of Muhammad as his prophet. In English, this translates as: 'There is no god but God, Muhammad is the messenger of God' A single, honest recitation of the shahadah in Arabic is all that is required for a person to become a Muslim. This declaration, or statement of faith, is called the kalimah. In some sects in Shia Islam, the creed is expanded with the addition of a phrase concerning Ali at the end to say: 'and Ali is the wali (friend) of God'. Taking this creed is one of the five pillars of Islam. The complete shahadah cannot be found in the Quran, but comes from hadiths, sayings or  or tacit approvals ascribed either validly or invalidly to the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Business consultant Mr Ali has also applied for permission to illuminate the sign in low voltage lighting. A family member, who did not wish to be named, added: 'It's our home and we should be free to do whatever we want. 'We're suppose to have freedom of speech in this country and be allowed to express our faith however we please. 'We don't intend to cause any kind of offence but I don't see how it is any different to having a St George's flag hanging outside your home.' Mr Ali applied for retrospective permission, but it was turned down. Newport Council have argued that the sign is an obtrusive 'advertisement' according to planning regulations. Under these guidelines, an advertisement includes any word, letter, model, sign, placard, board or notice used for advertising, making an announcement or direction. A council statement read: 'The property is domestic property and is not a mosque where such signs might be expected. 'The . sign consists of letters and words that announce religious faith and so . can be considered to be an advertisement and express planning consent . is required. 'The . advertisement is prominently sited upon the host building and is also . prominent. Its size and position on the building make it obtrusive.' Legal fight: A court will now have to decide whether the message should be classed as an advertising hoarding like a McDonald's (above) A refusal of advertising consent will . now be subject to a public hearing in Newport Civic Centre on February . 15 after Mr Ali appealed the decision. The sign has divided opinion among Mr Ali's neighbours on the quiet suburban road. Beryl Morgan, 78, who lives opposite, said: 'Maybe it's OK for a mosque, but I don't think it's a suitable for a house. 'It's not the sort of thing you should be allowed to have on the side of your property. 'It's an eyesore, I don't want to have to look out of my front window and see that every morning. But Joel Davies, 25, said: 'I don't mind it at all. I think he should be free to express his religious preference. 'The sign is very tastefully done, the green lettering looks good against the stonework. I think it adds a bit of colour to the street and I'm not sure what the problem is.'","Message reads: 'There is no god but Allah, and Mohammed is his messenger'

Not since his ancestor led the Charge of the Light Brigade had an Earl of Cardigan been accused of involvement in such a foolhardy confrontation. David Brudenell-Bruce looked like a ‘man possessed’ as he clashed with a trustee of his family estate after losing a legal battle over heirlooms, a court heard yesterday. Old Etonian Brudenell-Bruce, 60,  had taken former friend John Moore to the High Court accusing him of selling family portraits without his permission. Cleared: The Earl of Cardigan, David Brudenell-Bruce, arriving at court with his wife Joanna (right) and an unnamed woman . A week after a judge rejected the . Earl’s claim that the trustees had overstepped their power, he and Mr . Moore were involved in a confrontation on his 4,500-acre Savernake . Estate, near Marlborough, Wiltshire in which the trustee alleged the . aristocrat ‘lost control’, spat, threw stones and called his wife an . ‘ugly sow’. But after a day-long trial at . Salisbury magistrates’ court, the Earl was cleared of assaulting Mr . Moore and of a second charge of damaging a pick-up truck driven by the . estate’s foreman in a separate incident. Chairman of the bench Dr Pauline . Tremlett said the Crown had not proved its case beyond reasonable doubt, . adding: ‘We accept there is a background of acrimony between Lord . Cardigan, the estate trustees and its staff.’ She said both men had been ‘insulting . each other’s wives’ in an argument that became ‘more and more heated and . then became puerile’. Argument: Trustee John Moore, pictured with wife Monique, had claimed the 60-year-old Earl looked 'fearsome' as he shouted at his wife, spat at him and threw debris at his car . The Earl, who appeared in court under . the name Lord David Brudenell-Bruce Cardigan, is an indirect descendant . of the 7th Earl, who in 1854 led the disastrous British cavalry charge . of the 600 ‘into the valley of death’ against the Russians in the . Crimean War. Leaving court, Lord Cardigan – the . father of singer Bo Bruce, who was runner-up on BBC talent show The . Voice – said: ‘I am delighted and relieved. I wasn’t looking for trouble . on either incident.’ Mr Moore, a friend of 30 years, had . said he was driving home through the estate on April 29 last year when . he was forced to stop  because the Earl’s dog ran into the road. He claimed he was pleasant to the . Earl, who responded with ‘vulgar abuse’, spat at him three times, waved a . stick in his face and threw roadside debris at him. Treasures: The Earl of Cardigan lost a legal battle with Mr Moore over the ancestral portraits a week before the alleged attack on his family estate. He has been cleared of any wrongdoing . Grand history: The Earl of Cardigan, who leases a lodge on the 4,200-acre estate, had denied the charges . The Earl of Cardigan denied spitting, being . aggressive with the stick and throwing debris . Mr Moore said: ‘His eyes were wide open and he looked like a man possessed. My wife was terrified.’ His wife Monique said: ‘David called . me an ugly sow. He looked fierce and frightening.’ Mike Pulsford, . defending, accused Mr Moore of ‘embellishing’ his evidence an said had . recently received a letter saying the Earl wanted him removed as . trustee. Lord Cardigan denied spitting, being . aggressive with the stick and throwing debris at Mr Moore. But he . admitted calling Mr Moore’s wife an ‘ugly sow’ and exchanging ‘puerile’ insults ‘like two children in a playground’. He and his wife Joanne tried to get away on several occasions. ‘My wife was getting more and more . upset,’ Lord Cardigan said. ‘He [Mr Moore] told my wife “You’re too fat. It looks like you could do with the bloody exercise”.’ Lady Cardigan . told the court: ‘If anything, we were the victims. We were just walking . our dog and trying to get away. 'John was just saying “It’s all your . fault the estate is in trouble”. David must have said “go away” six or . seven times.’ Lord Cardigan told the court he has a . 49 per cent stake in the estate, which has been in his family since . 1067. His son has the other part, and it is administered by two . trustees. He moved to the US in 2005 and claims . that on his return in April 2011, he found the trustees had removed oil . paintings worth £1million from Savernake Lodge, which he leases from the . estate. He argued the pictures were ‘tenant’s fixtures’ and should not have been sold without his permission. But the High Court concluded the paintings were held by the trustees.","Earl of Cardigan cleared of assaulting estate trustee and criminal damage .

A fantasist who slashed his own face with a razor 16 times and told police he was the victim of a racist attack has been jailed. Christopher Afford claimed he had been attacked by four Asian men who had warned him 'no white person should walk here.' But really the 28-year-old had made the whole thing up to get attention after breaking-up with his girlfriend. Christopher Afford appeared at Peterborough Crown Court today (left). He admitted perverting the course of justice after making up an attack to get attention . Craig McDougall, prosecuting, said: 'On the day the defendant had an argument with his then partner. 'When he got home, his brother-in-law phoned police saying Afford had been attacked by four Asian men. 'An ambulance attended and medics found a number of cuts to his head, but they were all superficial.'He also told police that the men had warned him: 'white people should not walk here'"". The court heard that Afford, a chef from Peterborough, even gave descriptions of his make believe attackers to police. But when officers examined CCTV footage of the area they did not see anyone matching their description and no blood was found at the reported scene. Charles Falk, defending, said: 'The defendant made the allegation in a moment of madness when at his lowest ebb because of the end of his relationship. 'He cut himself as a result of attention seeking. The break up of his relationship affected him deeply.' The case also worried detectives as he had claimed the incidents happened near the New England area of Peterborough which has a large Asian population. Officers wasted hours of valuable police time trawling through CCTV footage trying to trace the culprits. Afford admitted perverting the course of justice and was jailed for a year at Peterborough Crown Court on Monday. Judge Nic Madge said: 'I stress that I put the possibly political undertones of this out of my mind.'But I cannot ignore the risk of inflammation of community or race relations. 'In my judgment, that means this is more serious than simply wasting public resources of police and ambulance.'","Christopher Afford, 28, from Peterborough, made the incident up after he split up with his girlfriend ."

Or maybe it has something to do with her younger brother James’s new relationship with television presenter Donna Air. Whatever the case, love was clearly on Pippa Middleton’s mind when she wrote her most recent recipe instalment for Waitrose – a ‘romantic picnic for two’. In the piece, the socialite sister of the Duchess of Cambridge extols the benefits of ‘whisk[ing] away someone special for an evening of gazing and grazing’. Picnic time: If your name happens to be Pippa . Middleton, the humble strawberry jam sandwich simply . doesn't cut the mustard on a spring picnic, as you'll discover in the new edition of Waitrose Kitchen . The 29-year-old’s Provencal Picnic menu includes peach and vanilla fizz, a fig and goat’s cheese fougasse – a type of bread associated with Provence – smoked chicken and melon salad and strawberry and lavender cheesecake jars. But frankly it would be cheaper – never mind easier – to head to a nice restaurant. Because to buy all the ingredients from Waitrose and cook the meal from scratch would cost almost £100 for two people. That figure is based on the first  relevant choices available on the supermarket’s website, ranked in terms of popularity. If you follow Miss Middleton’s advice, you would also need to  invest in tea towels ‘with French stripes’, enamel plates  and quilted rugs, adding £85  to the total. For the utmost authenticity, you’d need to fly to Provence, too – a snip at £1,014 for two people, based on a return flight with British Airways. Even without a trip away, anyone attempting their own version of her latest ‘Friday Night Feast’ would be advised to take the day off – it takes at least two and a half hours to prepare. Fragrant: One of Pippa's recipes calls for dried lavender. Unfortunately, the flower is not available at Waitrose . Tasty: According to Pippa, her strawberry and lavender cheesecake jars will be a hit with your man . Despite this Miss Middleton, who is dating stockbroker  Nico Jackson, 35, still advises readers to ‘quickly prep, pack, then whisk away someone special’. Her tips are unlikely to go down well with hard-working mothers, or indeed anyone who works full-time. Miss Middleton became  the face of Waitrose after the company ditched Delia Smith when her three-year contract ended in January. Her first column for Waitrose Kitchen magazine caused controversy because of the price of the ingredients involved. In this month’s column, her second, Miss Middleton waxes lyrical as she describes how her menu is inspired by Provence. She writes: ‘Here’s my vision of the perfect picnic. I’m in Provence, in a field just off the beaten track, where we’ve parked the car and thrown a quilted rug across the dry, parched grasses. Fight back: Delia has said she won't cook any of Pippa's recipes, as featured in Waitrose Kitchen magazine . ‘The hazy sky is cobalt blue, cicadas hum around us and it’s hot, very hot. But not too hot for a picnic. 'Around us are plump peaches, figs and strawberries, oozing ripe cheeses and crunchy baguettes, torn and ready to mop up every last morsel.’ A spokesman for Waitrose said  the menu cost £57.13, based on its own calculations. That figure used prices for whole packs of ingredients. It added up to £23.83 if only the quantities required were taken into account. She added: ‘Typically many of our customers would have some of the basic store cupboard ingredients – so their shopping lists would be considerably cheaper. 'Our shoppers are savvy and will typically shop across our different ranges when buying ingredients for recipes.’ She said that the Daily Mail had chosen ‘many of the expensive options’. The Mail chose the most popular items, in the smallest size packs available. PEACH AND VANILLA FIZZ . 'A subtle aperitif with a hint of lemon and vanilla,' says Pippa.

Foreign Office minister Baroness Warsi breached the House of Lords Code of Conduct by failing to declare income from renting out a flat . Tory minister Baroness Warsi was today censured by Parliament’s standards watchdog for failing to declare income from renting out a flat. A complaint against the senior Foreign Office minister was upheld by the Lords Commissioner for Standards, Paul Kernaghan, for receiving thousands of pounds from tenants in her Wembley flat. After being made a minister in May 2010, she moved out of the flat on security advice but could not sell it because of a dramatic fall in house prices. Some £30,000 had been wiped off the property’s value. Instead Baroness Warsi, who was Conservative party co-chairman at the time, rented the flat out. She received £6,937 in rent during 2010-11 and less than £5,000 in 2011-12. As minister without portolio she told the Cabinet Office about the flat, but did not notify the House of Lords authorities where the income should have been recorded on the register of interests because it was more than the £5,000-a-year threshold. In evidence to Mr Kernaghan, she blamed ‘an oversight, for which I take full responsibility’. In today’s ruling, the Commissioner said: ‘Baroness Warsi was not engaged in any comprehensive scheme to obscure her property interests and it should be noted that her failure to register her rental income did not result in any financial loss to the taxpayer, or additional monetary gain to herself. ‘Nevertheless, the Code seeks to promote openness and accountability and the absence of monetary gain does not absolve members of the requirement properly to register relevant interests.’ The peer has apologised and the matter is now regarded as closed, said the House of Lords Privileges and Conduct Committee in a report. Baroness Warsi said: ‘Throughout this process, I have endeavoured to ensure that relevant authorities have been notified at all times. The fact that I owned, and was letting out, the flat was known to Cabinet Office, the Leader of the House, and HM Revenue and Customs. As soon as I became aware that the flat was not included on the Register of Lords' Interests, I immediately informed the Registrar. ‘I would sincerely like to apologise for any failure to disclose my personal interests in accordance with the rules of the House.’ Mr Kernaghan cleared Baroness Warsi of a more serious allegation that she improperly claimed overnight subsistence allowance while staying in the spare room of a flat in Acton, west London, which was being rented by Tory official Naweed Khan. Lady Warsi referred herself to the Commissioner over the allegation, which relates to a six-month period in 2007-08 after she was made a peer and was waiting to move into the Wembley property. At the time, peers were allowed to claim £165.50 a night for the cost of staying in London to attend the House of Lords. Lady Warsi told Mr Kernaghan that she spent part of that time staying in hotels but also spent around 12 nights at the Acton flat and paid an ‘appropriate’ amount of £1,200 to Mr Khan. In today's report, Mr Kernaghan said he had interviewed both Mr Khan and the property's owner Wafik Moustafa, and concluded: ‘There is an arguable case that she was entitled to claim a night subsistence allowance towards the cost of maintaining a residence in London from the point where she took on contractual liability for her flat in Wembley and incurred financial costs by reason of paying a deposit. ‘She has also put forward evidence of expenditure in relation to her interim accommodation arrangements, even if some of that expenditure might not always be viewed as necessarily incurred. In any event, I cannot be satisfied that on the balance of probabilities that she breached the Code of Conduct.’","Lords Commissioner for Standards upheld complaint against senior Foreign Office minister .

The 57-year-old former MP cheated the taxpayer out of £53,000 in one of the worst cases of fraud to emerge from the parliamentary expenses scandal. As a consequence of the judge's ruling on her mental health the former MP for Luton South will not be jailed nor receive a criminal record, despite her conviction of 21 counts of fraud earlier this month. Out and about: Former MP Margaret Moran is pictured leaving a pub in Southampton only five days after she was deemed unfit to stand trial . Moran, who resigned in 2010, appeared to be enjoying a glass of wine with her husband at a pub in West End, Southampton, a few miles from their Hampshire home last week, despite being deemed too depressed to defend herself in court. Ms Moran and her husband were also seen around 20 miles away at Lepe Country Park, where they spent an hour walking their dog. Moran did not have to appear at Southwark Crown Court on November 13 nor enter a plea to the 15 charges of false accounting and six of using false information after a judge ruled her ‘severe depressive disorder’ meant she was unable to defend herself. The charges included submitting ‘bogus’ invoices for more than £22,000 for goods and services which did not exist. Up and running: Ms Moran did not have to appear at Southwark Crown Court to enter her plea in the case against her over her fraudulent expenses claims . Able to drink: Despite a judge ruling she was too fragile to defend herself in court, MP Margaret Moran appeared to enjoy a glass of red wine at the pub near her Hampshire home . Up for a walk: Ms Moran was later seen at Lepe Country Park, walking her dog with her husband . Between April 2004 and August 2008 she submitted fraudulent claims of around £60,000 – more than double that of any of the other four MPs who have been tried – of which she received more than £53,000. The jury found that the case against ‘broken woman’ Moran, who earned a £64,766 salary as an MP, was ‘proved’. Mr Justice Saunders said he cannot ‘punish her as such’ through a prison sentence or fine. Instead, he can give her a hospital order, supervision order or absolute discharge. He adjourned his decision but indicated a supervision order is most likely. Meanwhile, Moran is being treated by psychiatrists at home in Southampton. Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, added: ‘The verdict does not feel like justice done.’ 'Depressed': Margaret Moran is pictured leaving Westminster Magistrates Court after she was officially charged over her fraudulent expenses claims . The court heard how Moran, an MP from 1997 until her resignation in 2010, ‘abused’ the system of claiming parliamentary expenses, which was largely based on trust. Peter Wright QC, prosecuting, said MPs were permitted to receive expenses for a designated second home, but she had twice swapped the designation of her second home ‘in a process known as flipping’. She had exploited the system to ‘kit out’ homes in London, Luton and Southampton. In 2006 she submitted a claim for £4,756.40 for replacement kitchen units for her second home, which was accompanied by an invoice from a firm called Elite Builders that was a ‘complete forgery’. A year later, she submitted invoices for £14,805 and £1,823 for work in the name of Mandere Construction, but the bills were ‘utterly false’. In 2008, she ‘flipped’ her designated home to Southampton, which belonged to her then fiancé and now husband Michael Booker. She submitted false bills for £22,500 of building work at this property, including dry rot repairs, which was for work completed in the previous financial year, when she had already exhausted her parliamentary allowance, and when her designated second home was in Luton.","Ex-Labour MP was ruled too depressed to defend herself at expenses trial .

Blessed with brains as well as beauty, Georgia Willson-Pemberton appeared to have it all. But the one-time child ski champion’s life was gradually destroyed by anorexia and a deadly addiction to laxatives, her despairing family told yesterday. After a four-year battle with the eating  disorder, the former head girl of a private school died following an overdose of over-the-counter laxative pills, which caused ‘catastrophic’ organ failure. Her weight had plunged to less than seven stone – desperately low for a 26-year-old woman who stood at 5ft 11in. But in the grip of anorexia, she had continued to take laxatives, buying more than 6,000 over the internet from supermarkets. Her father Robert, 62, sobbed as he told her inquest how he was helpless to save his ‘hugely intelligent’ daughter. ‘The . world was her oyster, she could have done anything,’ he said. ‘Her . ambition just disappeared.

Miss Willson-Pemberton continued to lose weight and died in hospital in . December after collapsing at her parents’ £2million home in Putney, . south-west London. She told doctors she had taken 50 . laxatives several days earlier and surgeons at the Chelsea and . Westminster Hospital found her gullet, stomach, small intestine and . liver had been irreparably damaged. Intensive . care consultant Michelle Hayes said she believed the ‘catastrophic . organ damage’ was caused by the overdose and long-term ‘chronic laxative . abuse’. Miss . Willson-Pemberton had been a star pupil at the £29,000-a-year Heathfield . School in Ascot, Berkshire, becoming head girl as well  as a junior . skiing gold medallist  in national championships.

A bogus lawyer has been sentenced 14 years in prison for duping 'desperate and vulnerable victims' into thinking he was a bona fide legal professional. Giovanni di Stefano, 57, became known as the Devil’s Advocate for taking on 'unwinnable' cases  with a client list including road rage killer Kenneth Noye and timeshare fraudster John ‘Goldfinger’ Palmer. Despite no legal training, the fraudster managed to win some of his cases. But his high-flying legal career was brought to an abrupt end when he was convicted of 25 charges including deception, fraud and money laundering between 2001 and 2011. Behind bars: Giovanni di Stefano, pictured arriving at Southwark Crown Court ahead of his sentencing for fraud, was today jailed for 14 years . No ordinary lawyer: Giovanni di Stefano built up a reputation for defending the seemingly indefensible. Now he has been convicted on 25 charges including deception, fraud and money laundering . Today di Stefano, who was briefly a director of Dundee FC in 2003, pleaded guilty to another two counts of fraud and a further three counts were ordered to lie on file at London’s Southwark Crown Court. As he stepped out of the dock after hearing his sentence, di Stefano told the judge in a loud voice: 'I am obliged, my Lord'. Judge Alistair McCreath, the Recorder of Westminster, noted there were many offences over significant periods of time. He said the fact that the victims, which included a disabled man seeking damages for the loss of an arm, were all 'desperate and vulnerable' and faced losses which were not just financial but also included the 'raising and dashing of false hope' were aggravating factors. The 57-year-old conned clients out of millions of pounds by setting himself up as a lawyer when he had no legal qualifications and was not registered to work as a lawyer in Italy or the UK. He used the Italian word 'avvocato' on business cards, letterheads and identification documents to give . clients - and the judiciary - the impression he was an advocate. Giovanni Di Stefano as he arrives back at Southwark Crown Court to face charges of fraud . Giovanni di Stefano has represented some of Britain's most notorious criminals . Giovanni Di Stefano acted for Patrick 'Dutchy' Holland, a career Irish criminal, best known for being the first person accused of killing Irish investigative journalist Veronica Guerin, which he denied until his death . The judge told di Stefano: 'I recognise . that you did not actively seek out those whom you defrauded. They came . to you. You did not approach them but there is more than one kind of . predator. 'Some predators hunt down their victims, others lie in wait for them. 'Your victims in this case were all desperate people and people who, because of their desperation, were vulnerable.' The judge also noted that, while this case is about money, 'it is also . about something different and great - it is about the real distress you . caused to so many people'. 'You had no regard for them nor for their anguish,' he said. 'Your only concern was to line your own pockets.' During the trial, di . Stefano told of his links to Robert Mugabe, Osama bin Laden, Saddam . Hussein and his 'friendship' with the daughter of Slobodan Milosevic. The . court was shown a 2004 BBC documentary in which he described Saddam as a . 'nice guy' and boasted of being asked to defend killers such as Jeremy . Bamber, Harold Shipman, Kenneth Noye and Linda Calvey. He . was born in the small town of Petrella Tifernina in central Italy, but . moved to the UK as a boy and went to school in Wollaston, . Northamptonshire. Prosecutor . David Aaronberg QC had told the jury that di Stefano had gained fame . for handling clients 'whose cases others considered unwinnable or too . difficult to defend'. But he did in fact win some cases, overturning a manslaughter conviction against Nicholas van Hoogstraten in 2002 and getting him released from prison. In 2003, Di Stefano secured the release of John 'Goldfinger' Palmer from prison on a technicality, with only a fine of £33million for timeshare fraud, which Palmer later avoided paying. Not best director: Di Stefano was briefly on the board at Dundee . Former Dundee director Giovanni di Stefano (right) pictured at a press conference with team manager Jim Duffy (left) and new signing Fabrizio Ravanelli . Pop guru Jonathan King (centre), who was convicted of a series of sexual assaults on teenage boys, with his lawyer Giovanni di Stefano . The harm that di Stefano inflicted was 'in financial terms alone high', said the judge. But he added: 'In terms of emotional harm, it was much greater - the building of false hopes, always and inevitably dashed, followed by years of misery and frustration as they tried to recover what you had stolen and in the end were forced to come to terms with their financial loss.' The judge said di Stefano had 'lied' to his victims about what he was capable of and who he was. His crimes were 'planned and persistent' and some of his attempts to defend his behaviour in court amounted to 'breathtaking cynicism', the judge noted. Di Stefano, of North Stream, Marshside, Canterbury, Kent, was found guilty of nine counts of obtaining a money transfer by deception, eight counts of fraud, three counts of acquiring criminal property, two counts of using a false instrument, one count of attempting to obtain a money transfer by deception, one count of obtaining property by deception and one count of using criminal property. Today he pleaded guilty to stealing £150,000 compensation that should have gone to a man who had lost an arm in a car crash. The money was due as part of an insurance policy but di Stefano had it paid in to his business account and 'duly stole it'. The court was told it was a 'wicked' crime and is one which 'stands in a league of its own'. The bogus lawyer also admitted defrauding engineer David Brown and his family of £160,000 including the £75,000 life savings of his partner's mother. This case also involved £20,000 costs which were not paid out. Due to the 'utterly wrong' advice that di Stefano gave him - 'to protect your own position' - he lost his home and his job.","Giovanni di Stefano, 57, earned nickname for taking on difficult cases .

The death toll from the Bangladesh factory which collapsed last week has now passed 500 after another 29 bodies were pulled from the rubble overnight. Hundreds of workers were inside the eight-storey building near the capital of Dhaka when it collapsed into rubble last week, many of whom are still unaccounted for. The Rana Plaza housed five garment factories and with the new death toll of 507, the disaster is now ranked the second most deadly structural failure in modern times after 9/11. Mass burial: The bodies of 34 unidentified garment workers killed when the Rana Plaza building collapsed in Bangaladesh have been interred in a mass burial a week after the disaster . Tragedy: Several hundred people attended the mass burial in Dhaka today, which took place amid calls for the owner of the collapsed building, Mohammed Sohel Rana, to face the death penalty . The collapse was caused by four powergenerators located on the roof, the head of a government inquiry into the disaster said today. The four generators started up when the power was cut following an earthquake, and this may have caused the building to fall in on itself. 'Together with the vibrations of thousands of sewing machines, they triggered the collapse,' investigator Main Uddin Khandaker said. Nine people have been arrested over . the disaster which is thought to have been caused by the owner Mohammed . Sohel Rana illegally adding floors to the building. Yesterday, hundreds . attended a mass burial for 34 unclaimed victims who were too battered or decomposed to be identified. As the bodies of the unclaimed . victims were placed in the graves, men and boys recited a traditional . Muslim prayer for the dead. A country in mourning: A crowd gathered in front of the row of graves at the traditional Muslim funeral today, following the horrific collapse that exposed the unsafe conditions plaguing Bangladesh's garment industry . Death toll: Dozens of unclaimed bodies were buried in Dhaka today in the wake of the horrific accident, which claimed the lives of more than 400 workers . Workers at the cemetery have dug . several long rows of graves as authorities expect to bury scores more . unidentified bodies in the coming days. Five . garment factories were housed in the illegally constructed Rana Plaza . building that collapsed last week, five months after a fire killed 112 . people at another clothing factory. The tragedies exposed the unsafe . conditions plaguing Bangladesh's garment industry, which supplies many . European and American retailers. EU officials are considering action including changes to Bangladesh's duty-free and quota-free access to the giant EU market to 'incentivise' responsible management of the nation's garment industry. Pressure built inside Bangladesh as well, as a May Day procession of workers on foot, in pick-up trucks and on motorcycles wound its way through central Dhaka demanding safe working conditions and capital punishment for the building's owner. They waved the national flag and banners, beat drums and chanted 'Direct action!' and 'Death penalty!'. Anger: The building collapse, in which at least 410 people died and 2,500 were injured, was the worst industrial disaster in the country's history . Sorrow: The European Union is considering trade action against Bangladesh, which has preferential access to EU markets for its garments, in order to pressure Dhaka to improve safety standards after the building collapse killed hundreds of factory workers . Consequences: Rescue workers fear the death toll could rise even further after the collapse, which reduced the building filled with workers to an estimated 600 tons of rubble . From a loudspeaker on the back of a truck, a participant spoke for the group: 'My brother has died. My sister has died. Their blood will not be valueless.' Rescue workers expect the number of dead to rise because they believe many bodies are still buried on the ground level of the building. There is confusion over how many people remain missing. The owner of the building, Mohammed . Sohel Rana, is under arrest and expected to be charged with negligence, . illegal construction and forcing workers to join work, which is . punishable by a maximum of seven years in jail. Protesters demanded capital punishment for Rana, 38, a small-time political operative with the ruling Awami League party. 'I . want the death penalty for the owner of the building. We want regular . salaries, raises and absolutely we want better safety in our factories,' said Mongidul Islam Rana, 18, who works in a different garment factory. 'Their blood will not be valueless': The owner of the building is expected to be charged with negligence, illegal construction and forcing workers to join work - which is punishable by a maximum of seven years in jail . Fury: The owner of the collapsed building, Mohammed Sohel Rana, was seen wearing a police-issue helmet and body armour as he was escorted from a hearing at the High Court in Bangladesh yesterday . The . Bangladesh High Court has ordered the government to confiscate Rana's . property and freeze the assets of the owners of the factories in Rana . Plaza so the money can be used to pay the salaries of their workers. Rana . had permission to build five storeys but added three more illegally. When huge cracks appeared in the building a day before its collapse, . police ordered an evacuation, but Rana told tenants it was safe. The . next day, a bank and some shops refused to open but factory managers . told their workers to go back in. Hours later the building came down in a . heap of concrete. Rescuers estimate the building turned into 600 tons of rubble, of which 350 tons have been removed.","At least 507 people were killed when the illegally constructed Rana Plaza building collapsed into rubble last week .

Sesame Street puppeteer Kevin Clash, 52, is facing the threat of a fourth legal suit from a young man alleging sexual abuse at his hands. He will be represented by Jeff Herman, the attorney for Clash's second and third accusers, Cecil Singleton, 24, and a 29-year-old man so far known only as John Doe. Mr . Herman is still 'verifying' the fourth man's story, but has told Mail Online, 'It is very similar and so far nothing has fallen by the wayside in vetting it'. An adolescent Kevin Clash with his mentor Kermit Love, the choreorgrapher, costumer designer and creator of some of Sesame Street's most popular characters . A 19-year-old Kevin Clash, two years after his first encounter with Kermit Love and the same year he met his future wife, Genia. Whatever the outcome of these cases one thing is clear. Clash's life is far from the open book which he suggested when he described himself recently as a 'proud gay man'. In reality he has lived a double life for decades. It began with an invitation to join in Macy's Thanksgiving parade 33 years ago. Clash was just 17 - a gangly 6 foot boy - wowed to have been invited to New York by an older man he had met only once. That invitation came from the . flamboyantly named Kermit Love, a man to whom Clash has professed . life-long gratitude and loyalty. Love died in 2008 at the age of 91 and . is survived by partner of 50 years, Christopher Lyall. 'That year many of the Sesame Street . characters were literally in need of warm bodies, of hands, actually,' Clash has recalled. 'I would be a sort of Muppet temp on the Sesame float, filing in where needed. 'I was so wired on the train up to New York that I couldn't relax of focus on anything.' The voice of Elmo; the face of something far less appealing. Clash has been hit by a series of damaging allegations that he had sexual relations with underage boys . Sheldon Stephens, 23, the first accuser who recanted but now stands by his original claims . Cecil Singleton, 24, the second accuser to file a suit against Clash in as many weeks . A generous mentor: Kermit Love with his creaton, Big Bird, he invited Clash to stay in Manhattan after several phonecalls and one brief meeting . Love was a remarkable man with a lifetime's experience of theatre, costume design and puppets. He worked with choreographers like George Balanchine, designed costumes for the Joffre Ballet and created Big Bird and the mammoth like Mr Snuffleupagus. He spoke with an affected English, sometimes French, accent though he was from New Jersey and he was Kevin Clash's first entre into a world that was exotic, exhilarating and far removed from his Baltimore background. Clash has called them his 'fairy godmothers'. Clash is now the older man. But the difference is that Clash is being accused of a much more sinister 'game of father and son', as one of his accusers put it. Clash grew up in Turner's Station, a . blue-collar community just east of Baltimore, Maryland. His father, . George, was a flash welder, his mother, Gladys, ran a 'home-style . daycare centre' from the two bedroom, one bathroom home in which Kevin was raised with his three siblings. It was a hardworking, loving environment but, from the very start, it was one from which Clash stood apart. In a neighbourhood where kids played hopscotch, rode bicycles and jumped rope Clash had a fascination with fabric, old buttons, his mother's discarded house-slippers...anything from which he could make the puppets he loved from watching children's television shows. As a young man living in Baltimore Clash lived one life: in New York he lived another entirely . Driven by passion: Clash age 19, in New York on the set of children's show, 'Captain Kangaroo' As a boy Clash put on puppet shows for the children at his mother's daycare centre. While other kids played sport, Clash performed puppet shows for the children at his mother's day-care. Neighbours and peers thought his fascination was out of the ordinary, not that it bothered Clash. When he was 15 he performed at the local heritage fair in Dundalk. He made his own puppets, built his own set and met his first mentor as a result - local television host Stu Kerr. He was a fixture on local CBS affiliate WMAR, news announcer, weatherman, popular children's entertainer. He approached Kevin after his show and asked him to audition for a show he was putting together. 'I'd never had a boss before,' Clash recalls. 'I had to master the art of give and take'. It was an art he mastered and by the time he was 17, Clash was obsessed. Kermit Love - whose shared first name with Jim Henson's famous frog is only coincidental - came into Clash's life when he his puppet workshop was featured in a television show. Clash was 'blown away' he recalls in his memoir, My Life as a Furry Red Monster. It was his mother who encouraged her son to make contact, to look up Mr Love's number and give him a call. Nervous and fearful of rejection Clash did just that. 'We spoke for about ten minutes,' he writes. 'Before hanging up he invited me to come up to his workshop for a visit'. As luck would have it Clash's school, Dundalk High, had a trip to New York planned. For Clash, this included a personal visit to Mr Love's Greenwich Village workshop. The man looked, Clash recalled, 'like Santa Claus,' with his long white beard and workshop full of marionettes and muppets. They kept in touch - the 17-year-old fan and the mentor four decades his senior. After that stint he returned to Baltimore. He hung out at his mother's daycare centre. He observed the kids, 'how their emotions turned on a dime'. He studied them to improve his art and years later putting into practice those observations in the tactile character of Elmo. Elmo and Big Bird together on the Sesame Street float at this year's Thanksgiving Parade but for the first time in more than 30 years Clash was not there . When Love telephoned and invited Clash . to join in Macy's Thanksgiving parade his parents, he says, 'didn't . hesitate to let me go'. They dropped him off at the station. Clash spent the night in Love's Greenwich Village workshop. 'Kermit had a pull-out futon in the office area,' he remembers in his memoir. 'and I dutifully got ready for bed trying to avoid the temptation to poke around...I couldn't sleep and eventually abandoned the futon, giving in to my urge to check things out'. Richard Hunt, left, with Jim Henson, centre, and Frank Oz, right on the set of Sesame Street . Over the course of the next day's parade Clash was introduced to the cadre of puppeteers who would become his colleagues and companions on his increasingly regular visits to Manhattan. Richard Hunt was key among them. A talented puppeteer who died of AIDS in 1992. Hunt was openly gay - when Rudolf Nureyev made a guest appearance on the Muppet Show he notoriously and rather bluntly hit on Hunt. It was Hunt who, four years later, threw a small red muppet in Clash's direction and said 'Give him a voice'. That voice was that of the Elmo that millions of children so love today. After the Thanksgiving Parade he remained in touch with the Sesame Street puppeteers. He travelled regularly to Manhattan, shared an apartment with a fellow struggling artist Jim Martin and started to establish his 'big city' life supported by his 'fairy godmothers'. Kermit Love was 'generous with his time' and often on set as both puppeteer and Sesame Street character, Willy the Hot Dog man. Meanwhile, back in Baltimore Clash . lived a different life entirely. At the age of 19 he met Genia, a . student nurse and they began dating. In 1983 he was invited to be a full . time cast member on one season of Sesame Street, though was still to secure his own character. Double life: Genia, above, was married to Clash for 17 years and they had a daughter, Shannon, right . Clash attending the Peabody Awards in New York, 2010. He honed the excitable, tactile character of Elmo from watching the children in his mother's daycare . Clash and Genia married in 1986. Genia gave birth to their daughter, Shannon, in 1993 and it is clear that both remain committed, loving and mutually supportive parents.They were together for 17 years before, as Clash puts it, they 'finally admitted the relationship was in trouble'. After all, his life was increasingly riven between that of his Manhattan circle and his Baltimore family. Perhaps it was inevitable that the two lives - one that began with that invitation to New York from Love, the other embarked upon with Clash's own proposal of marriage - would prove unsustainable. Though none could have imagined quite how catastrophically they would be thrust into the spotlight. Clash's lawyer has said that the allegations have 'no merit' and that his client's reputation will be 'robustly defended' should the cases go to trial. But for the time being the man whose career was made by finding a voice remains silent. And the voice of Elmo has become the . face of something altogether less endearing.","How Big Bird creator, Kermit Love, changed the course of Kevin Clash's life after inviting him to stay over and help out at Macy's Thanksgiving Parade .

A tanker carrying liquefied natural gas finally docked in Britain yesterday as pressure on energy supplies continued to mount . A giant tanker carrying liquefied natural gas finally docked in Britain yesterday as pressure on energy supplies continued to mount. The ship reached our shores from Qatar as the threat of the cold snap continuing into April meant the unprecedented spectre of gas rationing continued. The UK only has enough gas in storage to meet two days of demand after the latest blast of freezing weather led to millions of families turning up their heating higher than is usual for March. The Government sought to play down concerns over the country’s rapidly depleting gas reserves, insisting that there was no danger of shortages. Ministers said they were ‘confident’ that there was enough gas available to meet the UK’s needs. In a desperate attempt to stave off a crisis, measures were taken to boost the volume of gas flowing into the system. The National Grid said the amount of gas received from North Sea production and imports through pipelines from other parts of Europe had outstripped demand. This temporary surplus allowed some storage sites to be replenished – providing a cushion against spikes in demand or problems such as pipelines failing in the next few days. The situation eased further after a large gas tanker ship from the Gulf state of Qatar docked at the Isle of Grain terminal in Medway, Kent, in the early hours of yesterday morning. The Mekaines was thought to be carrying enough liquefied natural gas (LNG) to meet Britain’s needs for 12 hours. A second tanker, the Zarga,  delivering fuel from Qatar is due to arrive in Milford Haven, South Wales, today and two more vessels – one from Trinidad – are set to dock in the UK later this week. Price rise: The shortfall is likely to push up the long-term price of gas and could result in household tariffs rising by up to 15 per cent before next winter . Analysts believe they will supply a total of around 430million cubic metres of gas – compared with current daily demand of around 350million cubic metres. Energy Minister John Hayes has played down shortage fears . The crisis deepened on Friday when an undersea pipeline connecting Britain and Belgium shut down without warning – pushing the price of gas up by 50 per cent to a record high of 150p a therm, up from Thursday’s price of 100p. Ofgem, the energy regulator, said: ‘While gas supplies are tight at the moment and there is no room for complacency, Britain does benefit from a diverse range of gas supplies and National Grid has many tools to manage the system and to prevent householders’ supplies from being disrupted.’ If rationing is needed, businesses and power stations will be restricted first, but then householders will be ordered to cut down on the amount of gas they use for heating their homes. Energy Minister John Hayes said: ‘As the cold weather continues, the UK’s gas needs continue to be met. ‘We get our supplies from a diverse range of sources and the market is proving to be highly responsive to the UK’s needs. ‘We are never complacent, but National Grid are confident that the situation today is stable and as expected.’","Gas ship docked in Medway, Kent, from Qatar over the weekend .

New evidence being investigated by police in Los Angeles may link the apparent suicide of a man in London to the notorious Charles Manson murder family. There has been a lingering suspicion that 29-year-old Joel Pugh’s death in West London’s Talgarth Hotel in December 1969 could have been a hit ordered by one of history’s most evil mass killers. Now detectives believe they have stumbled on a treasure trove of new clues that could shed more light on the 43-year-old mystery. New link: Sandra Good with Joel Pugh (pictured in 1969) who was found dead at the Talgarth Hotel in West London amid suspicions he was murdered at the order of cult leader Charles Manson - Sandra was a member of Manson's 'Family' A US Bankruptcy Court in Texas this week granted a request by Los Angeles Police to review eight cassette tapes containing hours of conversation between Charles ‘Tex’ Watson – one of Manson’s most fervent followers – and his lawyer. The recordings represent the first new clues in the case in decades and experts believe they could yield evidence supporting Manson’s boasts that his sick family killing spree claimed more than the nine known victims. ‘Manson told one of his cellmates his followers committed as many as 35 murders,’ said Stephen Kay, who prosecuted the cult leader. Mr Pugh’s death was ruled as a suicide . by the British authorities, who said the young American boyfriend of . Manson devotee Sandra Good had been depressed. Crazed: Charles Manson (left) last year ahead of a parole hearing in California and in 1970 (right) taken shortly after he was convicted of conspiring to murder seven people . But Mr Kay is convinced he was murdered by a Manson follower. The victim was found naked except for a sheet with his throat slit and his wrist slashed. ‘Manson despised him – and people who Manson hated ended up dead,’ added Mr Kay. Nobody knows yet what’s on the tapes, but discovering their existence was enough for Los Angeles detectives to re-open the case. Officers believe Watson ‘may have . discussed additional unsolved murders committed by followers of Charles . Manson,’ according to a letter sent to the US Justice Department by Los . Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck. ‘Do . we expect to find something in the recordings? We just don't know,' said LAPD Commander Andrew Smith. ‘But we're going to check just like . any good investigator would.’ Tragic victim: Pregnant actress Sharon Tate who died August, 1969, was murdered by Charles Manson and his cult followers . Police also suspect more bodies of Manson family victims may have been buried under their one-time hideout at the Barker Ranch in Death Valley, one of the world’s hottest places. The serial killer and five members of his so-called ‘Family’ are serving life terms for the 1969 murders of nine people, including the pregnant Sharon Tate, wife of film director Roman Polanski. Now 74, Manson is imprisoned in a California where he has had a swastika carved crudely into his forehead. Retired Los Angeles police sergeant Paul Whiteley, who investigated the Manson-ordered slaying of musician Gary Hinman in 1969, says: ‘I’m almost certain Joel Pugh was murdered in England by a Manson Family member called Bruce Davis. ‘We know he was in London at the same time and we heard from an informant that The Family had struck in Britain, but we were never able to get Scotland Yard interested in the case. I spoke to them and they just wouldn’t listen. ‘We were, frankly, amazed the police in England had decided it was a suicide and refused even to consider foul play.'

A retired BBC producer arrested in . the aftermath of the Jimmy Savile scandal has admitted he knew the star was a paedophile but 'wouldn't have dreamed of him grassing up'. Wilfred De'ath, 75, was told yesterday he will not face charges after being accused of sexually assaulting a teenage girl - now a famous British actress - in the 1960s. Defending himself today he said he was 'innocent', adding: 'We were all womanisers in those days but no girl I ever slept with was under age. 'It was a different culture in the mid-sixties. Sexual matters were taken much more lightly, there wasn't the . sensitivity that there is now.' Wilfred De'ath was was kept on bail for more than three months over an historic sex assault allegation but was later cleared . Mr De'ath was held by Operation Yewtree detectives, a Scotland Yard probe launched after the Top Of The Pops presenter's decades of abuse was revealed. But the Crown . Prosecution Service (CPS) said yesterday that there was not enough . evidence to charge the 75-year-old. In an interview today Mr De'ath admitted he had challenged Savile about spending a night in a hotel with a girl as young as 10 years old. 'I confronted him on the evening of . transmission, I did say that to him, I said ""I think you are living . dangerously"". He said ""oh, no, no, no"" and he just brushed me off,' he told the Today Programme. 'I was pretty shocked and disgusted. I, . at that time, was a happily married man with my wife and daughter in . Hampstead (London) and I was pretty shocked and appalled. ‘I was physically frightened of Savile. He was a boxer and a wrestler. I wouldn’t have dreamed of grassing him up. Jimmy Savile is one of the UK's most prolific abusers and has sparked an investigation into sexual activity at the BBC . 'I do slightly regret it but then it was . common talk in the corridors of Broadcasting House. It was common talk . that he liked young girls. 'I keep saying this but the culture in . those days was so different, it would never have occurred to me to go to . the head of the department. 'I am pretty disgusted, if I am honest with myself I am full of self loathing that I didn't do anything about it at the time.' Mr De'ath launched a scathing attack on police last night after being told he will not face charges. He was told he will not be . prosecuted after the complainant, once a relatively well-known actress, . withdrew her statement and said she was not willing to give evidence in . court alone. She claimed Mr De’ath groped . her thighs as they sat in a cinema in the 1960s when she was 14. She . came forward after he was interviewed as part of a TV documentary about . Savile’s past. Mr De’ath said he had met the girl . briefly at a party but had never gone to a cinema with her or assaulted . her. Earlier this month he said he had ‘a feeling of vindictiveness’ towards the now elderly actress. He had produced a Savile radio show but the allegations against him were unconnected to the disgraced paedophile. Mr De’ath, from Cambridge, is the . first of 11 people arrested as part of the controversial Operation . Yewtree investigation to learn his fate. He said he has endured a ‘very, . very unpleasant experience. I feel very indignant, I’m still very . angry’. He added: ‘I feel very bitter – I’m totally innocent.’ Others: PR guru Max Clifford (left) leaves his Surrey . home after being arrested by police. (Right) Jim Davidson was also arrested over several alleged sexual assaults . Dave Lee Travis (left) was arrested at his . Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire home in November. Gary Glitter (right) was arrested and bailed in October . He accused the . authorities of a ‘perversion of justice’ after he was kept on bail for . more than three months over a sex assault allegation dating back almost . half a century. He was . arrested by seven officers at 7am at his flat on Remembrance Sunday last . year as he prepared to go to church, after being accused of assaulting a teenage girl in the 1960s. 'They failed miserably, you have to . admit that, they failed lamentably in the case of Jimmy Savile. They . failed to get him when they could have got him. 'It seems to me they are kind of over, I think you know what I am trying . to say, they have gone too far the other way now and they are arresting . people on rather spurious allegations'. Arrest: Wilfred De'Ath at home in Cambridgeshire, which was raided by seven officers last year . Mr De'ath said he understood the police had been 'only doing their job' but he believed they were 'over zealous'. Chief Crown Prosecutor Alison Saunders said that the case could not be pursued without the witnesses statement as there was not enough evidence . 'My general comment would be that Operation Yewtree has gone too far,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'As Jim Davidson says it is getting silly now. It really is getting silly.' He also questioned why it was . necessary for a team of officers to arrest him over such historic claims . and accused Scotland Yard of allowing ‘political correctness’ to . ‘outweigh common sense’. A friend of his compared the behaviour . of investigators to that of the secret police in Communist East Germany . and the Soviet Union. The friend added: ‘At a time when . known drug-dealers, murderers and other real criminals escape . prosecution because of a lack of certainty of conviction, it has to be . asked why this sorry affair ever took place. 'Did the Yewtree team really . believe they could and should make a prosecution stick concerning an . alleged incident from nearly half a century ago to which there were no . witnesses?’ Alison Saunders, of the Crown . Prosecution Service, said the woman voluntarily withdrew her statement: . ‘She said that as she would be the only complainant to give evidence if . the matter went to trial, she did not want to pursue it. ‘She confirmed she came to this conclusion of her own free will.’ Others who have been arrested as part . of Yewtree are DJ Dave Lee Travis, paedophile Gary Glitter, celebrity PR . Max Clifford and comedian Jim Davidson. In January Esther Rantzen, the founder . of Childline, criticised the inquiry, saying police were targeting the . wrong people and creating confusion among victims.

An unholy row has erupted in the US after an independent clothing label discovered that 'Jesus' has been registered as a trademark. When Michael Julius Anton, from Virginia, wanted to patent his company Jesus Surfed he found that an Italian jeans label had already beaten him to it. Jesus Jeans was registered with the US Patent and Trademark office in 2007 and lawyers have told Mr Anton he cannot trade commercially using his chosen name, The Wall Street Journal reported. Italian clothing company Jesus Jeans won the exclusive right to use of the name 'Jesus' for clothing brands in the US in 2007 . The company does not have a patent on images of Jesus - just his name. Jesus Jeans has reportedly warned dozens other apparel start ups in the US against using Jesus in their brand since winning the patent. Others to have been warned include 'Jesus First', 'Sweet Jesus' and 'Jesus Couture'. Intellectual property lawyers say there is nothing against companies owning century-old names. 'If somebody—small church or even a big church—wants to use 'Jesus' for printing a few T-shirts, we don't care,' said Domenico Sindico  the general counsel for intellectual property at BasicNet, a publicly traded company based in Turin, Italy, that owns Jesus Jeans and the Kappa sportswear brand. But when companies like Jesus Surfed want to make money from their products, 'that's a concern,' he said. Lawyers have warned Mr Anton he can only use the name Jesus in 'descriptive, religious, free speech, ornamental sense' and that he should withdraw his trademark application. Mr Anton was sent a legal warning after he tried to register a patent for his clothing company Jesus Surfed . The owner of Jesus Jeans, Maurizio Vitale, came up with the name during a visit to New York when he walked by a theatre poster for the musical 'Jesus Christ Superstar'. BasicNet acquired Jesus Jeans in the 1990s through a bankruptcy but their attempts to trademark 'Jesus' have been turned down in countries including Turkey, China, Switzerland, Australia, Norway and Cuba. In 2003, Britain's patent office rejected its application as 'morally offensive to the public' but Jesus Jeans registered 'Jesus' through the European Union as a 'Community Trademark' valid across the European Union. Mr Anton said he is preparing to fight his case. 'Jesus Jeans has absolutely nothing to do with anything biblical,' he said. 'I didn't think it would be that big of a hassle.'","Italian clothing company Jesus Jeans owns US patent to name .

But one intrepid photographer decided to sightsee from a better angle, far removed from the hustle and bustle of the capital. James Charlick scaled cranes and stood precariously close to the rooftop edges of some of London's tallest buildings, climbing up to 570ft at times to take this stunning collection of city nightscape snapshots. Stunning: Web designer James Charlick scaled derelict buildings and cranes in London to take a series of stunning images of London's best loved landmarks at night . Bright lights: Fireworks light up the night sky above the bright blue London Eye in the background of this shot, with the Oxo Tower on the city's South Bank pictured in the foreground .

But he decided to spend the last year perched above the London skyline in order to capture its bright lights from the best possible angle. He said: 'Sky scrapers and iconic buildings are wonderful things and I think it's a shame that only the office workers within are able to enjoy the views they offer - especially since they frequently bustle around their work places without ever really appreciating those views. 'Combining that with the beauty of a city after dark, lit up with millions of fluorescent lights, and you have a beautiful view and an extremely peaceful atmosphere. 'At 175m above ground you don't hear much of the city noise so you become slightly detached from the frenetic energy below, you can just relax and enjoy.'

Dangerous: James, whose feet are pictured dangling in a vertigo inducing shot from the top of a central London crane, says that he never puts his life in danger when taking his pictures . Most of the pictures in James's collection of London were captured in one night from the top of a crane in the Square Mile overlooking the UK's banking heart. Elaborate architecture: Fenchurch Street Station looks stunning from a bird's eye view at night . Among the iconic buildings and landmarks captured in the collection of shots is the London Eye, seen lit up in a brilliant blue, Tower bridge, the Shard, St Paul's Cathedral and the Oxo Tower. One vertigo inducing image shows photographer James's feet dangling over the edge of a crane, the city streets seemingly miles below. He said: 'Being high up among similar tall buildings is a different feeling to being high up with everything else 20 or more floors below you, and makes for better images in my opinion. 'I believe this selection was taken over four trips around London, usually from 9pm onwards, more often after 11pm. 'Obviously this can vary depending on the time of year, since it's easier to be sneaky after dark. 'From a photographic point of view I'd love to visit around blue hour - the time after sunset when there is still colour in the sky - but this is trickier and is something I need to work out over the summer.' But James said that although his exploits may seem dangerous, he avoids pushing himself too close to the limit. He added 'With roof tops, and any kind of urban exploration, it's as safe or dangerous as you make it. 'Stay within your own limitations and comfort levels and the risk is minimal. 'Remember that construction workers clamber over the same structures every day - albeit wearing high visibility jackets and hard hats - so it's not as dangerous as it seems at face value. 'Of course if you decide to drape yourself over the edge of the crane counter-weight or around the wrong side of a safety barrier then the situation changes.

The little Staffordshire Bull Terrier cross was given the unusual name because of . severe problems with her malformed front legs, which failed to develop after she was . separated from her mother. But now, after intense physiotherapy, the 12-week-old has quickly made a fantastic recovery. Where once she walked awkwardly on bent joints, she can now bound along normally, her tail wagging as she goes. WONKY TWO WEEKS AGO... Wonky, disabled by malformed joints, was found dumped on a street in Leeds earlier this month . ... AND AS SHE IS NOW . Since being treated with physio, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier cross has made remarkable progress at the Dogs Trust . Staff at the trust have also given the 12-week-old a new name - Juliette . And staff at the Dogs Trust in Leeds, where she is being treated, have also given her a new name - Juliette. John Wannop, a vet at the centre, told how the puppy was taken there on February 9 with contracted flexor tendons on the back of her front legs - leading to a condition known as 'knuckling'. Knuckling of the carpal joints is caused by contraction of the tendons which prevents the wrist joint . from extending fully - and meant her front feet bended inwards because her . tendons were too short. He said that without treatment, it would have been impossible for Juliette to straighten her legs. She was found wandering the streets as a stray and was brought to the Dogs Trust by a member of the public. Because of her unorthodox looks, there had been concern she would struggle to find a new home. In fact, 600 people have so far applied to give Juliette a home, and staff are still sifting through applications. Amanda Sands, manager at the trust, said: 'She's had a very tough start in life. She was taken from . her mother too early and was then having to fend for herself on the . streets at just nine weeks old. 'She isn't a traditionally pretty pooch but she's a lovely girl with a great character.

'She had not had the right supplements to enable her to grow properly and so her front legs were too weak. 'We . don't know everything about her background but we think that she was . removed from her mother too early and was then abandoned.

'It's such a sad case because this was completely preventable if only she'd had the right love and care,' said Amanda Sands, manager at the trust .

Troubled oil giant BP was today forced to deny that it was seeking help from David Cameron as it fights for its future in the wake of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico three years ago. The company says it is facing a flood of false claims relating to the spill, and commentators have said it may have to pay out so much compensation it could be taken over by a competitor. Reports even suggested that the firm had appealed directly to the Prime Minister, asking him to raise the issue with the U.S. government in an attempt to limit BP's losses. However, Government officials today insisted that Mr Cameron had not been approached by BP, adding that the firm's troubles did not come up at a recent meeting with Barack Obama. SOS: Reports have claimed that BP is seeking the help of David Cameron to avoid a slew of compensation claims . BP has sought an injunction to stop payouts to companies which are allegedly claiming fraudulent or inflated losses from its $8.2billion (£5.4billion) pot of compensation for the disaster. An appeal document recently filed by BP in the U.S. courts claims that businesses from the Gulf coast have been handed millions of dollars for 'non-existent, artificially calculated losses'. The blow-out of the Deepwater Horizon well off the Louisiana coast in 2010 claimed 11 lives and damaged fishing and tourism industries as well as marine and wildlife habitats, forcing BP to agree a multi-billion-dollar compensation deal in April 2012. But BP warned that it would be 'irreparably harmed' unless the compensation system is reformed. The oil giant has said the cash drain could put its dividend at risk, and some experts feel this will make it vulnerable to a takeover. Disaster: The oil spill at the Deepwater Horizon rig, pictured, has led to billions in payouts from BP . BP said it has 'been ordered to pay . hundreds of millions of dollars - soon likely to be billions - for . fictitious and inflated losses'. The . claim adds: 'If this travesty is allowed to continue, BP will be . irreparably harmed and future defendants will be reluctant to settle . because they cannot be confident that settlement agreements will be . construed textually and fairly.' In its first-quarter results published last month, BP warned that compensation may be 'significantly higher' than the $8.2billion it has set aside, because it had underestimated the number of claims it would receive. BP also emphasised that the compensation settlement is 'uncapped except for economic loss claims related to the Gulf seafood industry'.

The runaway mom who went missing for 11 years before walking into a police station last week had set up a new life as a Florida cleaner and never spoke about the family she left behind. It emerged this week that Brenda Heist, who was eventually presumed dead by her husband and two children after suddenly going missing from their Pennsylvania home, was actually building a new life for herself on the other side of the country. Her new friends have spoken of their shock at discovering who she actually was and lifted the lid on her runaway life which was far less tragic than she has made out. Scroll down for video . Second life: Brenda Heist disappeared for 11 years before handing herself in last week. She never told her new friends she had left her family . Eleven years on the run: Brenda Heist pictured left at the time of her disappearance and right as she looked when she walked into a Florida police office last Friday . For a time she lived happily in Florida, making money as a cleaner and living with friends. Pictures reveal her drinking, swimming and hanging out with her new acquaintances to whom she never told her real story. 'We're learning now that life wasn't so bad for her in some of her . friend's eyes, that are calling us today,"" Detective Sergeant Schofield, . who is leading the investigation, told the Lancaster Online. Sondra Forrester said: 'We were close, she was a friend, and we did things on weekends. We spent time at the beach, and fishing. She was around my three kids. She was very sweet. She called me sweetie. I felt bad for her. It sounded like she'd had a hard life. She said she was a widow, had no children, that her mother died when she was 6.' Another friend who knew Heist as 'Lovie Smith' said she had no idea she was being deceived. 'I can’t believe she was being so dishonest… can’t believe she had . kids,' she told CBS Philly. Missing: The then 42-year-old was last seen dropping off her two children at school in Lititz, Pennsylvania . Heist worked as a cleaner in the Panhandle after hitch-hiking there with a pair of vagrants. She told police she was acting on a whim after suffering money problems and facing divorce. When building her new life she apparently told friends she had a husband who had died. She never revealed she . had two children left to grow up thinking their mother may have been . murdered. 'She didn’t want children, she didn’t like children and never had children. That’s what she told me,' the friend said. 'She spoke mostly about her husband and how much she really loved him and she was devastated that he died.' It was through work as a cleaner that she stole another identity - . lifting the driver's license of one of her housekeeping clients. When the deception was discovered she moved on again. Over the 11 years she is said to have three aliases. She also went by Kelsei Smith and even served a short time in jail for identity theft when that was uncovered. For a time it seems she was homeless although where and when is unclear. Her real identity didn't emerge until she turned up at a Florida police station this week. And as the news came out her family reacted in horror that they had been living a lie . Her daughter, Morgan Heist, 19, took to Twitter to reveal how angry she was after realizing her mother had willfully left. 'This doesn't . seem real. I feel like I'm in my own horrible nightmare and can't wake . up.' She also tweeted that she was glad her father was now exonerated of any blame or suspicion about his wife's disappearance. 'To every person who ever questioned my dads place in my moms dissapearance, (sic) take that.' Happy: Friends countered Heist's suggestions that she had lived poorly revealing for a time she worked as a cleaner and had an active social life .

Morgan Heist's Twitter updates since finding out last Friday that her mom is still alive reveal a young woman whose joy has quickly turned to anger . On . Sunday she wrote: 'Tomorrow will be the day I will hopefully finally . get closure in my life. I need the truth more than anything.' But later that day she tweeted: 'My brother and I don't want contact with her as of now.' By the next day her tweets about her mom had become more negative: 'You were finally becoming less and less of a memory. Now? You're a horrible nightmare.' Since then they have continued in a similar vein. 'To think I would EVER want to talk to a woman like you.. I can't believe I wanted to possibly see you. F*** you ""mother."" Another read: 'You will never gain my love or respect. You deserve to rot in hell for what you have done to me.' Morgan also revealed to the media on Wednesday that knowing what she knows now, she wishes she never cried over her mom's fate.

"By . Paul Thompson . PUBLISHED: . 18:47 EST, 7 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:48 EST, 7 July 2013 . A teenage sex slave of Colonel Gaddafi has told of the moment she was greeted by Tony Blair as he emerged from talks with the Libyan leader. The 15-year-old was waiting outside a tent in Tripoli when the smiling former prime  minister is said to have emerged and said: ‘Hi girls.’ The schoolgirl said he was unaware that she and other members of Gaddafi’s personal harem would later be raped in the rooms where the summit had just taken place. Shocking: Tony Blair is said to have emerged from the tent saying 'Hi Girls' to the sex slaves. He was unaware that they would late be raped in the same rooms the summits had been held . The moment is revealed in a new book that describes how the teenager was taken from her parents, groomed and forced to submit to the sexual demands of the Libyan dictator. Identified only as Soraya, she tells how the wives of visiting dignitaries would also disappear into Gaddafi’s tent and emerge with their ‘lipstick smudged and their hair undone’. But her biggest shock is reserved for seeing a ‘jaunty’ Mr Blair emerge from the tent. An extract of the book published in the New York Post says he was ‘clueless as to the atrocities under his nose’. The date of the meeting is not revealed in the book, Gaddafi’s Harem: The Story of a Young Woman and the Abuse of Power in Libya, by French author Annick Cojean. Mr Blair’s first visit to see Gaddafi was in 2004 – the year Soraya was handpicked to join the dictator’s harem. Meeting: Blair met Gaddafi several times as Prime Minister and Peace Envoy, later complementing him for his hospitality . At the time, Mr Blair – then prime minister – was accused of doing his so-called ‘dodgy deals in the desert’. Gaddafi had renounced terrorism, but was known to have been behind the Lockerbie bombing in 1988 and the 1984 murder of WPC Yvonne Fletcher. Mr Blair made two further visits to Libya in his role as a peace envoy, in 2008 and 2009, later writing a gushing letter thanking Gaddafi for his hospitality. Details of the abuse emerged after Gaddafi’s death at the hands of anti-government rebels in 2011. Soraya told her startling story in Gaddafi's Harem: The Story of a Young Woman and the Abuses of Power in Libya . ‘He was repulsive,’ said Soraya. ‘And he was president of my country.’ She said during her time as his sex slave she was kept locked in a windowless basement and girls were forced to watch porn films so they could learn how to perform to his satisfaction. Soraya said she was beaten so savagely that she was left with the ‘chest of an old lady’. Gaddafi simply referred to her as his ‘whore’ and his sex slaves were so psychologically damaged they rarely considered escape. Any who did, usually to Turkey, were tracked down and killed, the book claims. The despot was said to have demanded sex up to four times a day and would take Viagra to keep up his ‘insatiable’ demands. He would ‘shop’ for victims at weddings, schools and summits – and kept a secret flat at the University of Tripoli where he abducted and raped students. The book describes how Soraya was handpicked by Gaddafi during a visit to her school in 2004.Three days later, she was told she was going to meet ‘Papa Moammar’, who told her: ‘I am your Papa. ‘But I am your brother as well, and soon I will be your lover.’ Soraya, who now lives alone in Tripoli, said she was stunned by his hypocrisy. Despite professing to be a good Muslim, she said he drank and smoked and ignored sacrifices such as celibacy or fasting that are required during the holy month of Ramadan. She claims how another sex slave told her: ‘It’s Ramadan – Gaddafi style.’ A spokesman for Mr Blair was unavailable for comment.","A 15-year-old has told of how she was chosen to be a sex slave for Gaddafi .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 05:16 EST, 11 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:16 EST, 11 March 2013 . David Cameron today rejected Tory and Lib Dem calls to cut health spending. The Prime Minister, under pressure from all sides ahead of next week's Budget, bluntly rejected criticism that his promise to protect the NHS from austerity meant there would be deeper cuts to the army, police, business and councils. Mr Cameron said during a visit to the Mercedes-Benz UK Apprentice Training Academy in Milton Keynes: 'The NHS is not going to be cut by this Government.' David Cameron, pictured today, rejected the idea of lifting the ringfence on NHS spending . Mr Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne have been caught in a pincer movement between Tory right-wing MPs like Liam Fox and Lib Dem minister Vince Cable who today both called for an end to ring-fencing for vast swathes of Whitehall. Dr Fox called for a three-year freeze in public spending and an end to ring-fencing while Mr Cable warned it created an 'unbalanced approach' to public spending. But Mr Cameron insisted the health budget would not be touched: 'Plenty of people are giving me advice and there is one piece of advice I won't take and that is the piece of advice that says ""You ought to cut the National Health Service budget"". 'We made a very clear promise before the last election that yes, we were going to have to take difficult decisions, yes, we were going to have to make some very difficult and painful cuts but we wouldn't cut the NHS budget. I think it's really important for people to know that. 'It's really important for people to know how much I care about it. The NHS was there for me and my family, I want it to be there for other people's families too.' The Prime Minister was speaking at an event with apprentices at Mercedes-Benz UK Apprentice Training Academy in Milton Keynes . Mr Cameron said he wanted to make it the ¿new norm¿ for school leavers to take an apprenticeship or go to university . With 10 days to go until the Budget, Mr Osborne faces a bombardment of advice about how to get the economy growing. He has received calls to slash taxes, boost house-building and encourage wealth creation. A . year after the disastrous Pasty Tax Budget, which lead to a string of . embarrassing u-turns on taxing hot snacks, caravans and gifts to . charity, Mr Osborne knows his credibility is on the line ahead of the . March 20 statement. Today Dr . Fox, the former Defence Secretary and a standard bearer for the Tory . Right, urged the Chancellor to dramatically cut taxes. Dr Fox said: 'The great socialist coup of the last decade was making wealth an embarrassment. It is not. 'It is the prize for aspiration and hard work, and its side effects are higher tax revenues, more jobs and more investment.' Chancellor George Osborne is under pressure to deliver a major boost to the economy in next week's Budget . In a highly-provocative speech to the Institute of Economic Affairs – with the title The Right Approach for Britain’s Economy – he argued that money is better left ‘in people’s pockets rather than siphoning it off for the Treasury’. Tens of thousands of new homes should be built to help revive the economy, business groups have warned. The CBI is calling for 50,000 affordable homes . to be built, incentives for refurbishing empty homes and the housing . guarantee scheme to be extended to all types of housing. It wants to shift £2.2billion from current spending to high-growth areas without adding to the deficit. This would include £1.25billion on capital investment –including housing – and £950m on high-growth business tax measures, such as a 2 per cent cap on the planned increase in business rates and the removal of stamp duty on equity finance for mid-sized companies. Separately the British Chambers of Commerce is warning today that a point may have to consider major cuts in business taxation and joins with the CBI in calling for 100,000 additional new homes to be built by 2015. Dr Fox called for capital gains tax to be cut to zero and ‘reintroduced at a more sensible level’. ‘This would create a tax window where businesses that are sitting on assets might be encouraged to sell, investment in capital becomes more attractive and where hundreds of thousands of second homes might come on to the market,’ he said. And in remarks that put him at odds with David Cameron, Dr Fox also called for the ring-fencing of NHS, schools and foreign aid budgets to be scrapped. He warned it is a mistake to exempt these areas from the extra cuts the Chancellor will have to make by 2015/16 to balance the books. However, Downing Street was cool on the ideas, insisting the Prime Minister and Chancellor would 'stick to the course' they have set on deficit reduction. In an unlikely alliance, the call for an end to ring-fencing has been backed by Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable who denounced it as a ‘very unbalanced approach’ to government spending. While he said he remained a ‘strong . supporter’ of protecting the aid budget, Mr Cable suggested the NHS . ringfence could be narrowed to cover just ‘key areas’. ‘There . is obviously an argument for protecting key priorities, the aid budget . might be one, the science budget is another – we ringfenced that - . indeed there are key areas in health which are important,’ he told BBC . Radio 4’s Today programme. ‘The . problem about ringfencing as an overall approach to policy, is that . when you have 80 per cent of all government spending that’s ringfenced, . it means all future pressures then come on things like the army, the . police, local government, skills and universities, the rest that I’m . responsible for. ‘So you . get a very unbalanced approach to public spending. I went along with the . overall ringfencing approach in this Parliament – as part of the . Coalition we had to work as a team – but I think as a long term approach . to government spending, it isn’t very sensible.’ Unlikely alliance: Both Tory MP Liam Fox and Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable have questioned the decision to protect some areas of spending from cuts . However, Mr Cable poured cold water on Dr Fox's call for a VAT cut to kick-start growth. 'That is one of the many desirable things that we would love to do if we had more money,' he said. 'We have to do what we can afford.' Instead he reiterated his call for investment in housing and infrastructure projects to stimulate the economy. 'The priority has now to be to get the economy going,' he said. He reiterated his call for more extra borrowing to invest in big infrastructure projects. 'The metaphor I’ve used which helps to explain it – there’s a difference between increasing your credit card in order to keep a gas-guzzling car on the road, and taking out a loan in order to get a more fuel-efficient car, and the latter is a more sensible form of borrowing. 'And that’s what, when people talk about capital investment, that’s what we mean. 'Once you start investing in genuine capital projects, of course you generate an income. 'There may be a time lag – it doesn’t increase the deficit, the Government has to borrow temporarily, but it doesn’t do anything to affect the structural deficit. 'Once the economy does get going, you generate more tax revenue, there are less people dependent on public spending and the budget then tends to improve itself. 'I think that's the direction we are going in. My colleagues in government certainly understand that.' On the run: Mr Osborne must prove he is up the job of Chancellor after last year's disastrous Pasty Tax Budget . In recent weeks Defence Secretary Philip Hammond and Home Secretary Theresa May had also spoken out against further cuts to their departments. But Downing Street rejected the latest calls from Dr Fox and Mr Cable. Mr Cameron's official spokesman said: 'The Government receives many Budget representations. 'The Prime Minister has set out the approach that the Government will be taking in his speech last week, which is best summarised as ""sticking to the course"". 'There will be a 2015/16 budget-setting exercise later this year consistent with the fiscal plans we have set out.' Mr Cameron's view remains that spending on the NHS, schools and international aid should be 'ring-fenced"" from cuts, and that defence equipment budgets should enjoy a real-terms increase of 1% a year from 2015/16 onwards, said the spokesman. The decision to protect the aid budget from cuts has also been backed by Britain’s leading business figures. The chief executives of a group of 27 FTSE companies have come together to ‘applaud’ Mr Cameron’s decision. The . heads of GlaxoSmithKline, BP, Wm Morrison and BT are among the bosses . to have signed a letter in the Financial Times arguing that protecting . international aid spending was ‘not only the right thing to do, but a . smart investment’. ‘Developing . countries become emerging economies and emerging economies became the . engines of future global growth and prosperity,’ the letter states.","Ex-Defence Secretary Liam Fox leads Tory demands to slash taxes, calling for an end to 'the great social coup' which made wealth an embarrassment .

A teenage mother-of-one who underwent an abortion because she felt it was too soon to have a second child died after contracting a superbug during the procedure, an inquest heard today. Jessie-Maye Barlow, 19, contracted the superbug streptococcus B in a one in 10,000 chance that caused 'catastrophic damage' to her heart. Five weeks after the termination, Miss Barlow was rushed to hospital where she died just five days before Christmas. Tragic: Teenage mother Jessie-Maye Barlow, 19, died after contracting a superbug during an abortion . The young mother had given birth to a baby girl in June and then found out in the autumn that she was pregnant again. She and her partner, Daniel Fountain, thought it was too soon to have another child and decided to have an abortion. In November, Miss Barlow took medication designed to bring about an abortion at a specialist clinic in Richmond, south west London. After suffering bleeding and low mood, . she attended an NHS walk-in centre in Ashford, Middlesex, on December 8, . where staff referred her straight to the West Middlesex Hospital. Young mother: Miss Barlow decided to have an abortion after finding out she was pregnant just few months after giving birth to her first child . Doctors at West Middlesex Hospital diagnosed a case of superbug streptococcus B and that Miss Barlow had 'retained products of conception' meaning her body had not managed to pass everything associated with the pregnancy. Despite surgery and medication, her health continued to suffer over the following 10 days. Then on the evening of December 20 her family called an ambulance after she emerged from a shower complaining of severe chest pain. She was rushed from her home in Staines, Surrey, to St Peter’s Hospital, in nearby Chertsey, where she died hours later. Pathologist Dr Michael Hall told the coroner: 'This is one of the more extreme examples of this condition.' He said the bacteria had destroyed one of the valves on Jessie-Maye’s aorta and had then spread to and attacked her heart. Dr Hall continued: 'If the valves suddenly fail and the blood rushes back into the heart, the heart cannot cope with it. 'The heart will stop functioning and the patient will die.' Dr Richard Lyus, of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, who carried out the termination, said the incidence of infection following such a procedure was uncommon, between one in 800 or 1,000, while the chances of contracting a serious infection like Miss Barlow was closer to one in 10,000. He added: 'The rate of a very serious infection such as what Jessie had would probably be closer to one in 10,000.' He said that following her death he . had reviewed medical literature and found no other case of someone . experiencing what she had following an early medical termination. He . also conceded that when Jessie had failed to call the clinic in early . December as part of the follow-up procedure, the clinic had not called . her over the following days as they should have done. He added: 'Unfortunately it was simple human error. 'I think, yes, Jessie should have been contacted and they would have spoken to her and advised her to go to hospital.' The inquest, before Alison Hewitt, the assistant deputy coroner for Surrey, continues at Woking, Surrey. Diagnosis: After suffering continued bleeding, Miss Barlow was referred to West Middlesex Hospital where she diagnosed with having contracted streptococcus B and treated with medication and surgery .

Britain's cherry lovers can look forward to a bumper crop of their favourite fruit this year, a new report showed yesterday. Despite the cold spring weather delaying the cherry season, the quality of the fruit is likely to be excellent, according to the latest research. Trade magazine The Grocer reports that Mansfields, the UK's biggest cherry grower, is expecting a major increase in fruit volumes from its Kent orchards to around 700 tonnes after last year's crop was hit severely by the wet weather. A Co-operative Farms spokesman added: 'A good winter chill has meant blossom is only just coming out which is a good thing as the frost-susceptible period is shorter.' Coupled with high soil moisture content and a dry summer, it would result in a good fruit size at harvest, he added.

But the warm weather is not expected to last with rain moving in from the west from Tuesday. The rain may not reach the south east of the country until late in the day, meaning the region may enjoy one more day of sunshine.

A carer who terrorised elderly dementia patients during night shifts at a care home is behind bars after a judge branded him ‘cruel and almost sadistic’. Malcolm Cramp, 52, punished vulnerable residents of the home if they were not in bed by the time his shift started at 8pm. The court heard that one 97-year-old resident was forced into bed and tucked in so tightly she was trapped under the covers. Distressing: Malcolm Cramp, left, was sentenced to 12 months in jail for his aggression towards patients at the care home owned by ex-wife Michelle, right . She was left screaming in distress as . Cramp, who knew she was afraid of the dark, switched off her room’s . light and closed the door. On a separate occasion he tied the . same woman to a chair using a blanket, while three other elderly . residents were also abused, including an 81-year-old woman who was . dragged out of her chair. Police were called after a whistleblower at the care home exposed Cramp’s abusive regime. Leicester Crown Court heard that the . offences happened between February 2009 and January 2010, and that the . four women patients involved had Alzheimer’s. Strong message: Cramp was jailed for 12 months at Leicester Crown Court, pictured . Ill-treatment: Bullying Cramp was unsuited to care work, the judge said, but his former wife was cleared of all charges . Cramp, who was told by the judge that . he had ‘too short a fuse’ for care work, was sentenced on Friday after . being convicted of seven counts of ill-treating patients who lack . capacity. At the time of the offences, . Brockshill Woodlands Care Home in Oadby, near Leicester, was run by . Cramp’s then wife, Michelle, 43. She stood trial alongside him but was . cleared of two identical charges. The couple, from Wigston, . Leicestershire, are now separated and Mrs Cramp is no longer working at . the home. Jailing him for 12 months, Judge . Simon Hammond condemned Cramp for failing to treat his patients with . ‘dignity, respect and understanding’. He said: ‘It became apparent to . members of staff, but not his then-wife, that he was unsuitable for such . work. ‘He’d shout and swear and throw his weight about. ‘All four victims were vulnerable, . suffering from dementia, and in the twilight of their lives were . entitled to be treated with dignity, respect and understanding, which . the other staff sought to give, but sadly not the defendant. ‘There will be public abhorrence because of these offences, and the sentence must reflect that.’ In relation to the 97-year-old . victim, Judge Hammond said: ‘The defendant’s conduct on that night was . cruel and almost sadistic.’ A police investigation into Cramp was . triggered by an anonymous tip-off to the Care Quality Commission, . following an inspection by the watchdog in December 2009. The CQC’s subsequent report had rated . the 30-patient home as ‘poor’ and noted that it had received . information about ‘allegations of physical and verbal abuse’ which were . being investigated by police. When confronted, Cramp claimed that . other staff members had conspired in a ‘witch hunt’ against him because . his wife was manager of the home, which is privately run by . Leicester-based firm Prime Life. James Wood, managing director of . Prime Life, said the company took ‘immediate action’ as soon as it was . informed of the allegations against Cramp.

A retired sailor drowned himself in a harbour after being diagnosed with terminal cancer, an inquest has heard. Reginald Edlington White, 97, had been battling prostate cancer for several years but was told by doctors it had spread to his spine and was terminal. Less than a week after being told the diagnosis, the former Merchant Navy seaman walked into a harbour Aberystwyth, Wales, where he was later found dead. Inquest: Retired sailor Reginald Edlington White, 97, pictured on Remembrance Sunday in 2003, drowned himself in the sea at Aberystwyth, west Wales, after discovering his cancer was terminal . Tragedy: Witnesses tried to resuscitate Mr White after he was spotted in the water at Aberystwyth, west Wales, pictured, but he was pronounced dead . Witness Jean Calvert told the inquest: 'I saw him walking down by the slipway. At the bottom he bent down and picked things up, shells or something. I went away to make a drink and when I came back I saw him on his side and someone was trying to resuscitate him.' Ceredigion Coroner Peter Brunton said evidence presented at the inquest left him in no doubt Mr White had intended to kill himself and returned a verdict of suicide. Mr White’s son, Brian, said his father had spent six weeks in hospital but insisted on coming home just days before his death. 'He’d had prostate cancer for years but secondary cancer had gone to his spine,' he said. 'Social services and Macmillan said he had to have a phone and an alarm put in his house before he came home, but he had a go at me and I said okay. He was elated to come out of hospital.' But less than a week later, on February 6, Mr White took his own life. His son told the inquest: 'He was fiercely independent and lived on his own since my mother died in 1978. 'He came out of hospital on Thursday but on Friday he was agitated and we had to get the doctor. Terminal: Reg White, who loved the sea and was passionate about boats, had been battling prostate cancer for years but learned it had spread to his spine less than a week before his death . 'I think he knew that soon he wouldn’t be able to get out of the chair. I went to see him on Sunday and he said he didn’t want to be alive.' On Wednesday Brian White visited again and was pleased to see his father out of bed. He said: 'I went down early and he was up. He said he’d eaten. I said I’d be back after work but at about 4pm, officers came to say they’d found him in the harbour.' Delivering his verdict, Mr Brunton told Brian White: 'There is something very poignant about a gentleman like your father, living through life’s vicissitudes, surviving World War II and getting to almost 98, that it should have to end this way.' He had been a sailor in the Merchant Navy in the Second World War, Mr White was once adrift in the . Indian Ocean for weeks after the crankshaft broke on his ship. They eventually had to break radio silence and get tugged to South Africa for repairs. He . went on to work as a master painter and decorator, but always retained . his love of the sea, being a member of the Lifeboat and Coastguard crews . in Aberystwyth in the 1950s and ‘60s. Seaman: Reg White, pictured with son Brian, served as a Merchant Navy sailor during the Second World War . He was married to Gwyneth, . who died in 1978, and the couple had two sons Brian and Dafydd and . grandchildren Michelle and Leiam. Though he had been registered . blind 10 years ago, Mr White could still make out shapes and cycled to . Morrisons regularly up until three months ago. Described by friends as 'very skilful and knowledgeable', he was an expert knot-tyer, who could make beautiful arts and crafts from rope, made ships in bottles, and also previously played the guitar in several local bands. Dai Jenkins, Treasurer of Aberystwyth RNLI, said Mr White was one of the last of his generation of 'Aberystwyth harbour rats' who loved messing about with boats down at the harbour. 'Reg would come down the harbour twice a day or walk up to the benches and sit and talk to people,' he said. 'He’d always been a keen sailor and taught me a lot when we used to go out in the boat together. 'His health and eyesight had been failing recently but he always had time for a chat and was well liked down at the harbour. I’ll miss him greatly.' Town councillor Mair Benjamin lives on the next street to Mr White and said he was 'well loved and would be truly missed in the community'.

Making a point: Helen Mirren is pictured today in a customised t-shirt relaying her message to a drumming troupe who disturbed her performance at London's Gielgud theatre - until she told them to keep quiet . The 67-year-old star was angry they had . disturbed the first half of her play with their drumming, designed to . promote gay and transgender festival As One In The Park. Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, she . said something 'had to be done' as the noise had been getting louder and she and fellow actor Paul Ritter could barely hear each . other speak. She said: 'I was so upset from struggling through . the scene with Paul that I literally walked straight off stage, straight . up the stairs and straight out the stage door and banged my way through . the crowd who were watching and said 'stop, you’ve got to stop right . now’ only I might have used stronger language than that. 'They were very sweet and stopped the . minute they knew I wasn’t just a batty old woman haranguing them on the . streets of Soho on a Saturday night.' Angry: Helen Mirren, circled, storms out of the theatre to remonstrate with revellers outside the theatre . No messing: It is unclear what the famous actress said during the confrontation which was caught on camera . Woman on a mission: The actress is seen in this blurred footage trying to encourage the crowd to be quiet . Reports of her exact words differ, but it is clear the 67-year-old was, like Queen Victoria, not amused. Some said she told the group to ‘shut the **** up’. One is not amused: Helen Mirren as The Queen in play The Audience . Others said she ‘stomped out and shrieked “Quiet! I’m trying to do a play in here!” ’ Dame Helen is playing the Queen in The . Audience, a play about the monarch’s private weekly meetings with . various prime ministers at Buckingham Palace. Last week the role earned her an Olivier award for best actress. The play’s writer Peter Morgan also scripted the 2006 film The Queen, for which Dame Helen won an Oscar. Saturday night’s West End performance of the play was disturbed by the sound of drums five minutes before the interval. A . troupe of performers marched past the theatre in a parade designed to . promote As One In The Park, a festival for gay and transgender people . due to take place in East London this month. Followed by a crowd of around 200, the . musicians and dancers stopped outside a bar to perform a drum crescendo . – unaware they were drowning out Dame Helen’s lines. Now Dame Helen has revealed she would like to invite the performers to see her play. Audience . member Ben Scotchbrook told the Daily Mail that the actress finished . the first half without letting the noise affect her performance. When . the second half was interrupted by a lighting blackout, she went on . stage and revealed she had dealt with the source of the noise. ‘She was a real pro, she saved the day,’ said Mr Scotchbrook, a 43-year-old communications consultant from Buckinghamshire. ‘The noise was really irritating, but she didn’t get ruffled on stage. ‘In the interval I went out and tried . to ask the drummers to move on, to no effect. I don’t think they . realised they could be heard inside the theatre. Too loud: The band of drummers set to promote LGBT festival As One In The Park, seen in London's Soho, close to the Gielgud Theatre, which prompted Helen Mirren to leave her performance . Queen interrupted: Dame Helen left the Gielgud Theatre in the interval to tell the drummers off . ‘I went back in without realising Dame Helen had also been out. Then in the second half the performance was halted for several minutes by a technical failure. ‘Dame Helen came on stage and said, “We’re having a bad night”. 'She apologised for the noise and said, “I went outside dressed as the Queen and told them, not too politely, to ‘go away’ as they were spoiling the play”.’ Mr Scotchbrook added: ‘I have since heard that she was even less polite than we had imagined.’ Writing on Twitter, Lucy Lumsden said: ‘Brilliant – Helen Mirren, dressed as the Queen, stormed off stage last night and told a bunch of drummers to “shut the **** up”.’ Miss Lumsden could not be contacted to verify whether she heard the exchange first-hand. One of the parade organisers said: ‘She stomped out and shrieked, “Quiet! I’m trying to do a play in here! People have paid a lot of money for tickets”.’ Yesterday a spokesman for As One In The Park offered Dame Helen a free ticket to the event to apologise for the disturbance. Mark Williams, head of marketing at festival organiser Orange Nation, said: ‘We are terribly upset if we caused her any distress. If she’d like to attend the festival she’d be more than welcome.’ Dame Helen’s spokesman could not be contacted last night.","Dame Helen's lines in The Audience drowned in noise from drumming troupe .

Horrific: Attorney Maggie Baumer nearly lost her arm after trying to enter her apartment via garbage chute . A New York City lawyer is lucky to have her arm after she tried to enter a garbage chute in attempts to enter her ground-floor apartment. Maggie Baumer was locked out of her Chelsea apartment, and had tried to jump through the garbage chute around 5am Sunday morning, activating a trash compactor. The young woman was stuck in the compactor in excruciating pain for some 45 minutes before FDNY workers could free her. According to the New York Post, Ms Baumer had lent her keys to a friend and forget to ask for them back. Rather than calling a locksmith or her friend, she buzzed several different apartments until someone let her in the building. To get to her ground-floor apartment, she tried to enter a trash compactor that would take her to the cellar, where she could then go through a window back into her apartment, the Post reported. But rather than go down into the cellar, Ms Baumer was trapped by the compactor, which triggered a hydraulic piston to activate, crushing her arm. Place of residence: Ms Bauman lives in this apartment building in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood . A spokesperson for the FDNY told MailOnline that emergency workers arrived to the scene around 5:50am this morning. They said that Ms Baumer was trapped in the compactor for about 45 minutes, in excruciating pain. Firefighters and other emergency workers gave her morphine to cope with the pain, the Post reported. When they extricated her, Ms Baumer’s arm was nearly severed. She was taken to Bellevue Hospital, and remains in critical condition after undergoing surgery. Alcohol could have played a factor in the bizarre accident, a source told the New York Daily News. According to her biography on Goldstein & Lee’s website, Ms Baumer graduated from Tufts University’s law school and joined the firm full-time shortly after.","Maggie Baumer had been out late during last night's Halloween festivities .

Accused killer Jodi Arias kissed her new love interest and laughed with his friends just 24 hours after she stabbed and shot her ex-boyfriend to death in his shower, the man testified in court today. Ryan Burns testified in her murder trial in Phoenix on Wednesday that he had exchanged long emails and phone calls with Arias after they met at a business conference in the spring of 2008. He invited her to his home in West Jordan, Utah in June 2008 - and she arrived a day later than planned, telling Burns she had got lost, driven the wrong way and slept in her car for a while, he said. In fact, she had spent the previous day with her former boyfriend, motivational speaker and insurance salesman Travis Alexander, at his Mesa, Arizona home as they had continued to have a sexual relationship. New love: Ryan Burns, left, testified that Jodi Arias, right, visited him at his Utah home 24 hours after she killed Travis Alexander - but she never mentioned the killing, despite claiming it was out of self defense . 'Obsessed': Arias, 32, stabbed Travis Alexander, pictured, 27 times and shot him in the head . Five days later, Alexander was found stabbed 27 times, his throat sliced and with a gun wound in his head. The prosecution has alleged that Arias, 32, was obsessed with Alexander and killed him after he revealed he wanted to start dating another girl. While at first denying that she had even seen him that day, Arias eventually claimed that she killed him in self defense after he had been abusive and possessive throughout their relationship. Yet when she visited Burns the day after the murder, she never once mentioned the ordeal she had supposedly been through the previous day, he said in court. When she arrived at his home, Burns noticed that she had bandaged hands, but she told him she had sustained the cuts after breaking a glass at her job, he said. In court: Arias' murder trial, pictured Wednesday, is underway in Maricopa County Superior court in Phoenix . Testimony: Burns said they kissed and laughed with his friends soon after she arrived at his home in June 2008 . They settled down to watch a film together - and soon got physical, he told the court. 'At some point we were talking and we kissed,' he said. 'Every time we started kissing it got a little more escalated. At some point she was kissing my neck, I was kissing hers, but our clothes never came off.' Burns said they resumed their kissing later that night when she climbed on top of him, but they stopped as he did not want her to regret the visit due to her Mormon beliefs about sex. Burns, who is also a Mormon, was unaware that just 24 hours earlier, she had been posing provocatively for photographs later found on her murdered ex-boyfriend's camera. Happier times: She met Travis Alexander, a Mormon and motivational speaker, at a Las Vegas conference . Suspect: Travis Alexander's friend and roommate who found his body in June 2008 told a 911 dispatcher that Jodi Arias had been stalking and threatening the man . While she was confident with Burns, he said she became 'shy' and a 'little awkward' around his friends, but that she never acted as if anything more significant was wrong. 'She was fine, she was laughing about simple little things like any other person,' he said. I never once felt like anything was wrong during the day.' Burns said he did not know Arias was still seeing Alexander when the two began talking and making plans to visit each other, ABC News reported. The prosecution showed parts of their online conversations to the court, including a message where Arias told Burns she had 'trust issues' with Alexander and had been cheated on twice in the past. Burns' testimony, which continues on Wednesday afternoon, comes one day after Arias sobbed as prosecutors displayed images of the horrendous wounds she inflicted on Alexander. 'Last photo': Among the images on the camera was this one showing Travis in the shower before his death . Possessive: The jury was shown a picture of Arias in a t-shirt Alexander made reading 'Travis Alexander's' She wiped away tears as the  Maricopa County . medical examiner said Alexander 'may have' already been dead when she shot him in the head - a key detail that could make way for the death penalty. If . she did shoot Alexander after he was already dead it could qualify as a . 'heinous and depraved' murder, which would more likely send her to death row in Arizona. Yet the medical examiner said he could . not be fully certain Alexander was already dead from blood loss as the . body was already decomposing when it was found five days after the . killing. With the delicate brain tissue also . decomposing, he could not determine a bullet track through the skull or . how much hemorrhaging had occurred, which would signal whether Alexander . was still alive. The prosecution also showed images of Alexander's bloody bathroom and bedroom after the killing. Mess: Prosecutors said it appeared as if someone had tried to wipe the blood away after the murder . Blood-soaked: Another image shows blood stains on the carpet near his bathroom in his bedroom . Others showed defensive slash wounds on . Alexander's hands, sustained when he tried to fight back, and grazes on . his legs, suggesting his body was later dragged. They also displayed images found on . Alexander's camera, which included sexually explicit images of the pair, . photos of him in the shower moments before his death. In a bizarre twist, the camera also contained images of Alexander after the murder and a picture of Arias dragging his body - apparently taken accidentally when the camera was dropped. Alexander was found dead in his home in suburban Mesa on June 9, 2008 by two friends who went to check on him after he had been out of contact for days. 'Killer': She stands accused of stabbing and shooting Travis Alexander to death at his home in 2008 . Grief: Travis Alexander's sisters refuse to look at the images of the body in the trial on Tuesday . Arias originally claimed she had not . seen Alexander the day of his murder, before claiming she had seen two . men kill him, before eventually saying that she killed him out of self defense. The couple had met at a work . conference in Las Vegas in September 2006 and began speaking on the . phone every day. Court records show they exchanged as many as 82,000 . emails. They started dating . in . February 2007 and, because Alexander was a Mormon, Arias chose to be . baptized into the church. But they broke up in June 2007, with Arias . telling police jealousy on both sides was to blame.","Arias, 32, accused of stabbing ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander 'after he told her he wanted to date another woman'

Pet owners in Ireland may soon have to put seat belts on their dogs and cats, the Transport Ministry has indicated. Irish Transport Minister Leo Varadkar is in talks with road safety organisations regarding making securely fastening travelling pets mandatory. There is currently no legislation regarding how pets are kept in cars, despite the fact that some dog breeds, such as the English Mastiff which can weigh up to 150 lbs, pose a serious risk. Safety first: A dog shows off a safety harness, something which may become mandatory for pets in Ireland . Mr Varakdar was alerted to the problem by a member of the public and is consulting with the Road Safety Authority regarding the issue. Restraining pets in vehicles is receiving ‘ongoing consideration,’ a spokesman for Mr Varakdar told the Irish Independent. ‘The general advice is that neither people nor objects, including animals, should be unrestrained when travelling in vehicles.’ In Britain, motorists can be fined and may be . subjected to penalty points for driving without due care and attention, . if an animal in the vehicle is distracting the driver . The Irish Society for the Prevention . of Cruelty to Animals (ISPCA) today backed Mr Varadkar, saying putting . dogs in a harness can save lives. 'If you have a child in . the car, even a reasonably sized dog can come through like a missile and . you have 30kg, 40kg, 50kg or 60kg going around the cabin. It could . cause terrible damage,’ ISPCA chief executive Noel Griffin told the . Irish Independent. Dog days over: Irish Transport Minister Leo Varadkar in in talk with the Road Safety Authority regarding implementing rules for animals travelling in cars . ‘There's not a day goes by when I don't see a dog sitting in the front seat of a car with its head out the window. 'Nobody's trying to be a spoilsport, but ultimately losing the family pet could be the consequence.’ In the UK, the Welfare of Animals in Transport Order prohibits owners from transporting their  pets in any way that 'causes, or is likely to cause, injury or unnecessary suffering to that animal'. In the case of dogs, the RSPCA recommends that they are kept both secure and comfortable during transport, using a harness, travelling crate or a container. 'It is important that a dog is suitably restrained in a vehicle so that it doesn’t distract the driver or injure them if the vehicle stops quickly,' an RSPCA spokesman told MailOnline. 'When transporting your dog in a crate or container, you should ensure that it has enough room to sit and stand up at full height, turn around easily and lie down in a natural position. 'You should also ensure that your dog is able to see out of the container and that there is enough ventilation and suitable bedding should be placed on the floor to prevent the dog from slipping around during the journey.' The Irish Department of Transport has yet to confirm whether any legislation preventing owners from keeping their pets unsecured in the cabin may be introduced.","Irish Transport Minister in talks to make dog seat belts mandatory .

Meet Matthew Hawksley – the man with nine lives. In a tale of survival that would make the most death-defying cat jealous, the 25-year-old has come through a catalogue of life-threatening dramas. In all, he has cheated death eight times – surviving a broken neck, heart attacks, MRSA, pneumonia and cancer. Now on his ‘ninth life’, he describes himself as ‘the unluckiest man I know, but the luckiest man in Britain’ over his string of escapes. The first came when he and a group of friends decided to go for a swim in the sea during a trip to Ireland. Mr Hawksley did not realise the water was only 3ft deep and dived off a high pier – straight on to a bed of sharp rocks. Incredibly, he survived the impact, but shattered the fifth vertebrae in his spine which caused him to have a heart attack as his lungs filled with water. His life had to be saved four times within the next 30 minutes by first-aiders on the scene and paramedics who took him to hospital. He awoke from a five-week coma and spent months recovering. But his brushes with death were far from over. During his time in hospital he contracted life-threatening bouts of MRSA and pneumonia. Again he survived and, defying doctors’ initial expectations that he would never walk or talk again, he was back on his feet within months. However, not long after his release from hospital, he was given the devastating news that he had testicular cancer. The welder from Huntingdon, Cambridgshire, did not give up, and after receiving surgery, has now been given the all-clear. He said: ‘In lots of ways I feel like the unluckiest man I know – but I suppose I’m the luckiest man in Britain. ‘I have never really been down or upset. You just have to carry on.’ Mr Hawksley  was on a corporate weekend away in Grange, County Sligo, in June 2011 when the diving accident happened. Survivor: Matthew Hawksley after he broke his neck diving . Amateur triathlete Matthew Hawksley, from Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire, has already survived heart attacks, cancer and deadly viruses in his short life. He said: ‘There is no doubt  I was . saved by people who pulled me from the water and who knew exactly what . to do. I went into cardiac arrest numerous times that morning. I owe so . much to all who tended to me.’ He . was moved to the Mater hospital in Dublin where his family and . hairdresser girlfriend Avril Maleham, 20, had to make the decision to go . ahead with a risky spinal operation while he was in a coma. ‘I . woke up and I was completely paralysed. I could only see . black-and-white shapes and could only communicate by blinking and . sticking my tongue out.

A nuclear power station in Kent has been leaking radioactive waste, which can increase the risk of developing cancer, for months according to the Environment Agency. Routine tests on boreholes drilled close to the Dungeness B plant found traces of tritium measuring more than seven times the agreed level. But plant owners EDF Energy have reassured residents that it is unlikely that contaminated water has seeped into the local domestic supply. Leak: The Dungeness B power station n Kent has been leaking more than the agreed levels of tritium . Although the substance, a radioactive variant of hydrogen, can increase the risk of cancer, according to the Environmental Protection Agency in the US, it is considered one of the least dangerous nuclear waste products. Normal levels of tritium, agreed with the Environment Agency and measured in Becquerels, are usually considered to be anything under 100 per litre of water. But the tests in the boreholes close to Dungeness B showed levels of 760. The Environment Agency said: 'EDF informed the Environment Agency and the Office for Nuclear Regulation in September 2012 and in December 2012 that they had monitored elevated levels of tritium in the groundwater on the Dungeness B nuclear licensed site. 'Dungeness B is a significant distance from any boreholes used for drinking water abstraction. As a precaution, the local water authority has been informed of the results. 'EDF are conducting an investigation into the source of the tritium. Any regulatory response will be informed by the results of this investigation.' Owner: EDF Energy says that work is well underway to rectify the tritium levels . The Evironment Agency confirmed that levels of tritium were normal elsewhere in Dungeness B's surroundings and added that the power station is allowed to discharge tritium in the environment under permit. The World Health Organisations's guideline level for the maximum amount of tritium in drinking water is 10,000 Becquerels per litre. Tritium can inhaled, ingested and even absorbed through the skin and is a naturally occuring form of hydrogen found in the environment anyway. A spokesman for EDF Energy said: 'We take our responsibilities to the environment very seriously. At our sites we continually strive to improve our environmental performance by adopting best practice. 'We routinely monitor, record and report on our environmental discharges and sample our water. Out of action: The Dungeness A power station, pictured in late 2005, ceased operation in 2006. Normal levels of tritium have been monitored elsewhere around the site . 'Samples analysed during routine quarterly sampling of groundwater at Dungeness B indicated levels of tritium above the agreed Environmental Agency investigation level of 100Bq/l. This has been identified and isolated to one small area on site. 'Work is well underway to resolve this issue and the Environment Agency and Office for Nuclear Regulation site inspectors are being kept informed of the progress being made. The Dungeness Site Stakeholder Group is also being kept informed. 'The environmental impact is negligible and there is no risk to the public or our employees. 'Tritium levels in boreholes on the station boundary have been checked and confirmed to be at background levels and the local water company has confirmed that the local water system is unaffected.' The company added that drinking two litres of water containing a concentration of 850 Becquerels per litre of Tritium would result in less than 0.1 per cent of the average annual radiation dose received per person in the UK. This is the equivalent of eating two medium-sized baked potatoes everyday for a year. Dungeness B is two advanced gas cooled reactors which began operations in 1983 and 1985. It remains operational after Dungeness A was closed in 2006.","Dungeness B in Kent has been leaking more than agreed levels of Tritium .

Ecuador's . president Rafael Correa said on Saturday that Snowden is 'under the care . of Russian authorities', while also suggesting they did not let him . reach the country's Moscow embassy where he could apply for asylum. Venezuela has emerged as the country most likely to house the whistleblower. Nicolás Maduro said that the NSA whistleblower had not made a formal application for refuge but that he deserved protection under international law. Snowden has so far applied for asylum in 21 countries but faces a thinning list of options after Finland, India, Ecuador and Poland rejected his plea and a number of others said applications can only be made in person on their home soil. Government investigators began an urgent search for Edward Snowden several days before the first media reports were published on the government's secret surveillance program. Snowden, who has admitted to providing details of the top-secret programs, had worked on assignment at a Hawaii facility run by the National Security Agency for about four weeks before he said he was ill and requested leave without pay, according to the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. When Snowden failed to return, that prompted a hunt for the contractor, first by his employer Booz Allen Hamilton and then by the U.S. government, they said.

The killers of Stephen Lawrence were refused leave to appeal against their convictions yesterday. David Norris, 35, and Gary Dobson, 36, claimed their six-week trial at the Old Bailey which resulted in unanimous guilty verdicts was unfair. But a judge rejected their written applications at the Court of Appeal. They were given life sentences in January for the racist murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence.Dobson was ordered to serve a minimum  of 15 years and two months, while Norris  was given a minimum of 14 years and three months. David Norris, left, and Gary Dobson were found guilty of Stephen Lawrence's 1993 murder in January . Stephen Lawrence's killers will consider their next legal moves to challenge their murder convictions . The verdicts were a victory for the Daily Mail, which for 15 years has campaigned for justice for the Lawrence family. Norris subsequently launched an appeal on the basis that the use of a surveillance video in evidence was prejudicial. In the video, shot 20 months after Stephen’s 1993 murder, Norris was secretly filmed  telling friends he wanted to torture and kill black people. In an appalling rant recorded by a  police surveillance camera, Norris boasted he would ‘skin a black ****’ and ‘blow their two arms and legs off’. Then, he said, he would tell them: ‘Go on, you can swim home now.’ Norris’s legal team argued that the video was highly prejudicial because it did not prove he was involved in Stephen’s murder and should not have been admitted as evidence. The video also showed Dobson using violent, racist language. Over a period of 17 days in  December 1994, detectives heard him frequently use racist terms to describe black and Asian people, jurors heard. Dobson was seen in one clip recalling a time he threatened a black colleague with a knife. Lawyers for Norris also objected to the way the prosecution presented the scientific evidence during the trial. The breakthrough in the investigation came when a cold-case team of forensic scientists were called in. They found tiny traces of blood, hair and fibres on clothing seized from the pair’s homes. The defence claimed this was the result of contamination, but that was rejected by the jury. Dobson and Norris were the first people convicted over the knife attack on A-level student Stephen, 18, by a group of white youths near a bus stop in Eltham, south-east London, in April 1993. Yesterday Norris’s legal team indicated that this was just the first round of their efforts to challenge the convictions. His lawyers will now consider whether to renew the application before judges sitting at the Appeal Court. He said: ‘We will obviously give very serious consideration to the judge’s response to the legal application and decide whether to renew it orally.’","David Norris and Gary Dobson claimed their Old Bailey trial was unfair .

It seems even keeping her clothes on is not always enough to spare the Duchess of Cambridge’s blushes. After weeks of discussion about what Kate chose not to wear on holiday in France, another controversy has erupted over an item of clothing that she did put on in the Solomon Islands. At an official dinner to celebrate the nation’s culture, she wore a pretty sundress which she believed to be by a local designer – but which was actually made more than 3,000 miles away in the Cook Islands. Scroll down for video footage... The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in Honiara, Solomon Islands, on 16 September, wearing gifted clothes that are actually from the Cook Islands . The gaffe has caused an almighty row . in the Solomon Islands, where the government yesterday placed the blame . on Kethie Saunders, a local resident chosen as part of the welcoming . committee because of her knowledge about the intricacies of the nation’s . culture. In a fiercely-worded statement, the . government said it had been agreed in advance with the royal guests that . they would wear ‘something that would connect easily with the ordinary . Solomon Islands’. Organisers arranged for William to be . provided with a green ‘island shirt’ featuring a map of the islands and . coconut trees, while Kate was to bring a summer dress of her own. However, ahead of the royal couple’s . arrival on the first stop of their recent tour, Mrs Saunders was let . into their hotel room to leave gifts of flowers, chocolate and soap on . behalf of the organising committee. Kate and William pose wearing traditional Cook Island clothing during a visit to Honiara, Guadalcanal Island, one of the Solomons . The Solomon Islands, where Kate and William attended the party, and the Cook Islands, 2779.78 miles away, where the clothes they accidentally wore were actually from . Unfortunately, according to the . government statement, she also ‘smuggled in’ two items of clothing made . by a designer from the Cook Islands – a garish blue shirt for William . and the Duchess’s bandeau dress, which were laid on the couple’s bed. Kate wears the traditional Cook Island dress while she talks with the wife of the Governor General of the Solomon Islands, Lady Grace Kabui, in Honiara . When the royal party arrived, a week . ago last Sunday, a member of their staff noticed the shirt left for the . Duke was blue rather than green and checked with the government’s head . of protocol – who assured them that the clothes were, indeed, official . ones. But to add to the comedy of errors, it . seems that the Duke’s real shirt (as well as a dress for Kate, just in . case) had been hidden by their bags. Delighted by the gift, Kate ditched . her original outfit to wear it, and the fashion world was quick to . proclaim that it highlighted the talent of young designers in the . emerging Third World nation. But then, of course, its true origin . emerged. A government spokesman said: ‘The Duchess wore the dress . because she believed it to be from the Solomon Islands government and . thought it would be an appropriate gesture. Had she known it were from . the Cook Islands it would not have been worn and she feels bad about the . confusion. ‘We are incredibly frustrated that this situation has come about and see Kethie as entirely to blame.’ Mrs Saunders, who is understood to be . an existing client of the Cook Islands designer, said it was an . ‘unfortunate incident’ and that she had no intention of embarrassing the . couple or the local government. A St James’s Palace spokesman said . last night: ‘The situation arose through no fault of Solomon Islands . government or the royal household.’","Duke and Duchess of Cambridge attended Solomon Islands party this month .

"By . Matt West and Jill Reilly . PUBLISHED: . 01:36 EST, 8 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:46 EST, 8 May 2013 . Britain's first pay-as-you-go motorway is proving to be a flop with traffic dropping by 40 percent in just seven years. The head of the region's local transport authority says the M6 toll road which runs through the West Midlands, has not relieved congestion on the motorway around Birmingham. Geoff Inskip, chief executive of Centro, the West Midlands transport authority, called on the Government to take the M6 toll road out of private hands to ease congestion around Britain’s second largest city, after evidence emerged that traffic on the toll road has fallen since its peak of 55,000 vehicles a day in 2006. Under used: the M6 Toll Road should be nationalised rather than expanding the original M6 to cope with the projected 25 per cent increase in traffic over the next 15 years, transport chief Geoff Inskip said . When the £900m road was completed ten years ago . it was hoped the 27 mile stretch would relieve traffic congestion around . Birmingham with around 74,000 vehicles predicted to use the road each . day. Currently, around little more than half – 34,360 - the number of vehicles expected to use the road each day actually do, with congestion costing the West Midlands economy £2 billion a year. It was thought to be an ideal alternative to traffic jams for drivers, but when traffic is clear on the original M6, the cost deters motorists and the toll route is marginally longer than the free motorway. Congestion around Birmingham has now become . so bad that the Highways Agency has already begun work on converting the . hard shoulder of the original M6 motorway into a new lane in order to . deal with the additional traffic. Mr Inskip told The Independent: 'If the M6 Toll cannot . be made to work in terms of attracting more vehicles off the M6 then one . solution is to take it into public ownership. This would give us the . option of setting a level of charge that does encourage through . traffic.' Falling numbers: Traffic on the toll road has dropped by 45 per cent since 2006, it has been reported . Midland Expressway – a subsidiary of . Macquarie Bank – which owns and operates the M6 toll road has blamed the . economic downturn for the fall in traffic on the road. But critics have also pointed to . excessive charges to use the road.  It costs £5.50 for a car to use the . 27-mile stretch of motorway but for HGVs its costs double this amount. Mr Inskip said that nine out of 10 lorries now use the original motorway. 'We believe this is due to the price . hauliers and motorists are being asked to pay. It’s important we keep . the region moving and one way of doing that is to get HGVs, which are . not stopping in Birmingham, off the M6 and onto the toll road,' he said. There have been eight price rises in the . ten years since the toll road opened in December 2003 when a car could . travel on the road for just £2. HGVs were charged £10 for use of . the road before the charge fell to £6 the next year only for prices to begin rising again in 2005. Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said: . 'The problem is not private sector involvement but that ministers never insisted on regulated tolls. In a way, who can blame the operator? If they can maximise their income by having fewer cars paying more then why wouldn’t they? There’s less wear and tear on the road, and you need fewer staff and toll booths. Unfortunately what is good news for the company running the road is bad news for most drivers.' The call to nationalise the road comes . amid a debate on how to finance new road building in Britain, with tolls . being one option given consideration by the Coalition, although the . Government has ruled this option out for existing roads. Plans to . privatise the motorway network have also been shelved. The M6 toll road's owner, Macquarie faces the additional problem . of a £1billion debt burden associated with the road following a . refinancing in 2006. The bank is currently in talks with its creditors . to restructure the debt. In July, Midland Expressway is making . the toll road free to use for all haulage vehicles in an effort to . attract more hauliers to use it. The toll is due to remain in . private hands until 2054 and the Department for Transport said the . Government had no plans to nationalise the road before this.","M6 is Britain's only privately-run toll road - runs through West Midlands .

An odd job man disguised himself as a ghost before battering an 84-year-old man to death and robbing him of £3,000. Michael Fearon, 57 - a trusted friend of his victim - donned a white dust sheet with eye holes cut in it to lie in wait for widower Vincent Kershaw at his home in Greater Manchester, before pouncing on the terrified pensioner when he returned from a shopping trip. Fearon burst out of a cupboard dressed in his sinister disguise and beat Mr Kershaw around the head with a rubber mallet, then stole wads of cash from the pensioner's pockets and left him to die. Trusted: Odd job man Michael Fearon, left, disguised himself as a ghost to lie in wait for widower Vincent Kershaw, 84, at his home in Greater Manchester . Retired wagon driver Mr Kershaw, who lived alone and was described as a 'fiercely independent chap', is thought to have lain alone for up to two days before dying of his injuries. The pensioner was known to carry large amounts of cash on his person. Police alerted by a tip off over a week later broke into his £80,000 semi in Milnrow, near Rochdale, Greater Manchester and found the elderly man’s body in the kitchen, surrounded by his unpacked shopping bags. Officers who later arrested Fearon discovered he had regularly done odd jobs for Mr Kershaw, who had trusted him enough to give him a spare set of keys to his house. The killer - a compulsive gambler who had mounting debts - later attended his victim’s funeral with mourners unaware of his secret. Fearon, of Timbercliffe, Littleborough, Lancashire, is facing life in jail after admitting murder on the first day of his trial at Manchester Crown Court yesterday. 'Epic fracture': Widower Mr Kershaw, who lived alone at his house near Rochdale, is thought to have lain dying for up to two days after the attack . Investigation: Police acting on a tip-off discovered Mr Kershaw's body in the kitchen of his home more than a week after the attack on October 4 . Judge Michael Henshell told Fearon: 'You knew that Mr Kershaw was an easy target and you used your knowledge of Mr Kershaw's habits to plan your robbery. 'Although you are almost thirty years younger and strongly built, you decided that you needed to incapacitate him. The damage you caused must have been obvious to you at the time. 'When you left he was alive and you knew that from the sound of his breathing but you didn't do anything. The fact that you attended his funeral was particular hurtful incident for his funeral and for him,' the judge said. Judge Micheal Henshell . 'People of Mr Kershaw's age should be protected and respected. He trusted you and you abused that trust in the most horrible and treacherous way,' he added. Earlier the court was told how Mr Kershaw was renowned for being a man of smart dress and strict routine. He had lived alone since his late wife Bridget, 83, was admitted to a nursing home suffering from Alzheimer's disease. He was also well-known for carrying large wads of cash with him, and had ignored pleas to put his money in the bank. Fearon met Mr Kershaw at the care home where Bridget was staying and became a frequent visitor to his house after agreeing to do odd jobs, the court heard. Prosecutor Simon Medland QC said: 'When the defendant had money, he would be tempted to gamble it away. 'He had a business on the side, dealing in construction and building but he was short of money and needed to pay suppliers and work men who had been doing work for him. He was short of money and he knew that Victor Kershaw carried lots with him. 'He thought he would steal to get him out of that financial tight spot. It was obviously important to cover his tracks and disguise himself.' Murder: Mr Kershaw, 84, had trusted Fearon with a spare set of keys to his home . The incident took place on October 4 last year, after Mr Kershaw dressed up in his jacket and trilby and boarded a bus to go to his favourite cafe before picking up his pension. As he left Fearon was watching from his Volvo car and used the spare keys to let himself into the elderly man’s house. He put on his disguise and hid in a kitchen cupboard. Mr Kershaw, a keen collector of binoculars and watches, also browsed the goods at a local charity shop during his outing, a court heard. Mr Medland said staff would often see him with crumpled bank notes in his wallet and told him to put in the bank or 'someone will hit you and take it for you'. Shopping trip: 'Fiercely independent' Mr Kershaw, who was well known for being smartly turned out and carrying cash on his person, bought groceries at a local Tesco branch on the day of the attack . Sinister: As the pensioner - seen in his trilby hat - was going about his business, Fearon was lying in wait for him at the home where he lived alone . At around 12.45pm, Mr Kershaw went a Tesco Express and shopped for groceries before a taxi picked him up and dropped him off at his home. When he walked into the kitchen, Fearon burst out of the cupboard and hit him over the head up to six times with the mallet. Mr Kershaw’s body was discovered by police on October 14. Tests revealed he died from severe head injuries. He suffered what was described by doctors as an 'epic fracture' to his skull as well as a fractured cheekbone and broken nose. Mr Medland said: 'The defendant knew Mr Kershaw was dying when he left him. From the physical injuries and from the changes in his brain, it’s plain that he didn’t die quickly and must have been lying there medically alive but unable to move for possibly two days.' Fearon was arrested on October 22 after his car had been spotted on CCTV near Mr Kershaw’s home on four separate occasions on the day of the killing. He said later: 'It has been explained to me that intending to knock someone out has an intention to cause serious harm. But I didn’t intend to kill Mr Kershaw.' In mitigation Mr Michael Shorrock QC said: 'If he had intended to kill he wouldn’t have taken a rubber hammer. 'He had a pathological gambling habit which was a clear factor in the build-up of this offence - he had complete inability to engage in any treatment or receive help. 'He’s never been unemployed; he was a perfectly decent man going about his business in an ordinary way. He had a great fear when he got into debt. Thinking his whole world would come crashing down. He’s genuinely sorry and remorseful.' In a victim impact statement Mr Kershaw's stepson Anthony described the 'intolerable' suffering felt by the family. 'I'm still struggling and I'm very tearful at times,' he said in the statement. 'It was very upsetting and shocking as I saw the extent of Vincent's injuries. I almost didn't recognise him down to the blunt force. 'I wish it was a nightmare that I could wake up from. I strongly believe he [Fearon] had opportunities to change the outcome, not just before the death but after. It sickens me that he only admitted his involvement when the evidence was stacked against him.'","Micheal Fearon, 57, dressed as ghost and hid in Vincent Kershaw's home .

"By . Martin Jay . PUBLISHED: . 13:22 EST, 7 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:17 EST, 7 May 2013 . A Green Party MEP is demanding that immigrants who come to Britain to beg and commit crimes should be guaranteed the right to full state benefits and even be provided with police protection. Jean Lambert, MEP for London, is calling for new laws to protect immigrants from being excluded from social security benefits, under plans currently being put forward by David Cameron. In a bid to curb so-called benefits tourism, the Prime Minister has announced plans to curb rights to housing, health care and cash support from those immigrants who arrive in the UK with no job. Handouts: A British MEP wants immigrants such as these Roma gypsies pictured in Marble Arch last month, to be granted full rights to social security benefits . But in a European parliament report which calls on the European Commission to oppose Mr Cameron’s initiatives, Miss Lambert is demanding unlimited healthcare for immigrants and an overhaul of the social security system to ensure they are provided with sufficient financial support during their stay in the UK. In particular, she wants the hoards of Roma Gypsies – in particular the women – who illegally harass people on the streets of central London to 'not be excluded' from social security benefits as 'undocumented migrants'. In a draft report, Miss Lambert claims 'Women of ethnic background like Roma' have special needs, which MEPs will vote on in the coming weeks – long before the end of the year when Romanians and Bulgarians are given full rights of residency in the UK. The centrepiece of Cameron’s reforms is a six-month limit on the right of EU nationals to claim out-of-work benefits, which is coming under increased attack by Eurocrats in Brussels – who will now join forces with Jean lambert MEP who also wants Mr Cameron’s immigration reforms derailed. Miss Lambert’s report, aimed at ‘vulnerable groups’ does however include protecting older people in care from also missing out on benefits and proper care – or receiving  very low quality care which only extends to 'cleaning and feeding'. In it she calls on the European Commission however to force the government to 'carry out studies and surveys' to show how poorer immigrants are also being 'affected by austerity measures'. Clash: London Green Party MEP Jean Lambert is opposed to proposals by Prime Minister David Cameron to curb benefits for immigrants who do not have jobs . However, Miss Lambert wants Romas and . illegal ‘immigrants’ to not only receive benefits from the government . for often working in illegal rackets, but for them to also to benefit . from special protection against any bad feeling from British citizens . who might show their anger against them. The . London MEP and former teacher argues in her report for them to be . protected legally against 'hate speech, bullying and assault' as they . are often considered 'too much to care for'. And she has the support of the powerful European Commission which recently warned Mr Cameron that its officials would 'scrutinise' his reforms for fairness. Yet it has already come under attack from UKIP. 'The welfare state in this country exists to provide a safety net for hard times and it should be available to those who have paid into it through their taxes' argues the UKIP deputy leader, Paul Nuttell MEP. 'Our public services are already overstretched and it is irresponsible to allow them to be put under yet more pressure' he told the Daily Mail On Line last night. They warned that his proposals – including restrictions on housing, health and unemployment support – must comply with EU free movement rules. Tory MP Stewart Jackson warned the EU to “show some respect'. He insisted that decisions on immigration must be decided by the British parliament and he promised to 'strengthen' tests to ensure only those who pay into the system are able to receive handouts. Sir Andrew Green, chairman of pressure group Migration Watch UK, said: 'It is surely only fair that everybody should contribute to the welfare system before they can draw benefits.' Just recently a group of 60 Roma gypsies arrived in Marble Arch in London and are currently camping in Hyde Park, where Police are only able to occasionally check on their passports. Tourists have been reported as seeing woman squat in open view in the park, as open top tour buses trail past what was once a highlight of the London sightseeing tour. Britain is preparing itself for a predicted influx of Romanians and Bulgarians when they are given free access to our jobs market in January. MigrationWatch has warned that 50,000 could arrive in the UK every year for five years from 2014.","Jean Lambert, MEP is calling .

A spoof video of a British company's fictional bid to beam a cheese logo onto the moon has sparked panic at Nasa overs fears it could threaten the International Space Station. Advertising executive James Vellacott and his colleagues dreamed up the stunt by fictitious brand 'Mooncheeze' as part of an annual joke video they send to clients for a festive treat. To research the script they emailed a junior aeronautics officer in the US to work out what would be required to beam an image onto the moon. Scroll down for video . The spoof Mooncheeze advert on the moon concocted by production company Cherryduck as part of a viral video to be sent to customers. However, it raised alarms at Nasa who thought it was real. Film production company Cherryduck film their spoof advert on the moon - but failed to tell Nasa the plan was a joke . The firm claimed to have build a giant projector capable of projecting the Mooncheeze logo 220 miles onto the surface of the moon. However, in reality the projector seen in the video was a dummy made from just £15 of materials. The firm told Nasa: 'We are currently building an extremely . high-powered projection unit to project an image into space as part of . an advertising campaign.' But the gag quickly escalated up to senior NASA officers and James received a string of terse emails warning his plans were illegal. The space scientists warned James' multi media firm Cherryduck that it would have to contact aviation regulators in their own country. Producers at the advertising firm went ahead with the film - but yesterday admitted they had not contacted Nasa to explain the enquiry had all been part of a joke. Mr Vellacott, 42, said: 'A couple of emails were exchanged and we were terrified we were going to get a call from federal agents. 'Obviously we didn't think it would cause quite the panic it did. 'We were all laughing in the office because obviously it was just a bit of fun. 'But I suppose NASA has a very serious job to do and they must get loons suggesting ideas all the time. 'I suppose we just didn't expect Nasa to react like it did, I hope they join in on the laugh when they watch the clip.' The firm produced detailed plans for the project which it asked Nasa's advice on - but space bosses thought the plan was real . Cherryduck staff pretend they can see the image (left) and the machine the firm says projected their cheese logo onto the lunar surface (right) which was actually a £15 prop . Cheeryduck creative director Jez Furlong, 37, came up with the idea of a spoof company which specialises in children's cheese called Mooncheeze six months ago. As part of their usual script research the company called the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on behalf of 'Mooncheeze'. They were told to ask NASA and dutifully contacted the space agency - neglecting to tell them about the joke because they believed it would stop them getting the information they wanted. Mr Vellacott politely emailed Robert Gutro at NASA on November 27 querying the logistics of projecting onto the moon. He wrote: 'We are currently building an extremely high-powered projection unit to project an image into space as part of an advertising campaign. 'This obviously is an unusual project and I am seeking advice and guidelines from the many departments governing the airspace above us. 'This may be of no interest to you but we need to make sure that all the necessary authorities are notified accordingly. 'Could you direct me to any department that we will need to get permissions from.' An hour later he was 'cc'd' into an email from Mr Gutro to NASA officers Joshua Buck, Trent Perrotto and Rachel Kraft, outlining his concerns about the projection. The email read: 'UK Production Company that is building an extremely high-powered projection unit to project an image into space as part of an advertising campaign and they want to know if there are any guidelines or limitations they should be aware of. Stills from the spoof video showing a company's fictional bid to beam their cheese logo on to the moon . Film producer James Vellacott, 42, was stunned by a glut of emails from NASA boffins urging him not to project the made-up 'Mooncheeze' brand into space . 'I immediately thought of the space station, which is why I've forwarded this to you for response.' But a response from the Human Exploration and Operations at NASA Headquarters in Washington DC just five hours later showed they were taking the joke very seriously. Joshua Buck wrote: 'There are definitely international laws restricting lasers pointing into commercial air space. 'Also, if your light projection can in fact make it to 220 miles out, we would like to stay informed as it could potentially affect the astronauts on the International Space Station.' The same day communications officer Mr Buck wrote: 'If there's a potential for the light to reach the space station and could potentially affect the crew's vision or ability to see, we'd need to be aware.' And in an email later the same night he added: 'It also occurs to me that since the FAA has rules, you should probably talk to whatever ministry covers commercial air (and your version of Homeland Security as well) and see what sort of laws are in place in the UK and Europe.' Cherryduck still went ahead with its video - and were even able to finish it with their quotes from NASA. Mooncheeze the joke product concocted by production company Cherryduck . In the video Jez, James and the rest of the production team talk about how they brainstormed for the making of the advert in an 'The Office' style mockumentary. Amusingly the 'projection' equipment used in the spoof film was just a box made from black foam board and an old office lamp which cost prop designers just £15 to make. Some of the comedy lines include 'The moon - it's big, it's ballsy,"" and 'the world is no longer their oyster - the moon is too'. In another scene one employee of the company, based in Tower Bridge, London, jokes with a deadpan serious face: 'All we needed was for the moon to turn up.' The video shows the team planning and executing their plan to project a logo onto the lunar surface . The video shows staff planning exactly where the logo should appear . Mr Vellacott said the idea behind the 'Mooncheeze' advert was to make their clients laugh at the end of the year. He said: 'We didn't tell NASA it was a spoof because we needed to research it properly like we would do all our campaigns and we thought if we told them it was a fake they wouldn't help us out. 'We obviously found it hilarious knowing the product and idea was just a spoof and that the projector was just something we had bashed together using an office lamp for the purpose of the film.'","Joke corporate video claimed to be projecting a logo for a cheese firm onto the moon .

That's what lies in store for the residents of the small settlement of Dull in Scotland as the community gears up to formally link with the town of Boring situated in the U.S. some 5,542 miles away. A bond has been formed between the Scottish village near Aberfeldy in Perthshire and the equally unexciting sounding town in Oregon following talks between Dull and Weem Parish Council and Boring Community Planning Organisation. Drive through: The town of Boring in Oregon, U.S. and the village of Dull in Scotland have forged a common bond over the uninspiring names of the settlements . The idea of bringing the two places together emerged after Elizabeth Leighton, from Grandtully, in Perthshire, passed through the U.S. town while on a cycling holiday. She then decided to share the news of her exciting discovery with her Dull friend Emma Burtles and chairman of the Boring Community Planning Organisation Steve Bates. Mr Bates was interested in exploring the possibility of developing a relationship between Dull and Boring and he put together a plan to invite those living in Dull to take on 'Sister Community' status when Boring Planning Organisation meets in June. Exciting times: They may be more than 9,000 miles apart but the communities of Dull and Boring are set to become close friends . Confirming the move, Dull community councillor Marjorie Keddie received a 'Declaration of Sistership' from the logging town in Oregon on Thursday. Speaking at last week’s community council meeting, Mrs Keddie said: 'It might seem like a joke, but this could have real benefits for Dull. 'Everyone has been smiling at the prospect of the very eye-catching road sign this will inevitably require. 'It will be interesting to see where this goes.' Name game: The town of Boring (right) is too big to formally twin with Dull in Scotland (left) but Dull could become a sister community or Boring . Boring is too large when compared with Dull to qualify for official twinning status, but the two communities are hoping to create a close bond. Community council chairman Tommy Pringles joked: 'We might experience traffic incidents when people see the sign by the road. 'It’s bad enough when people stop dead to photograph the signpost for Dull. 'Imagine how many people would do a double-take if it said Welcome to Dull, a Sister Community of Boring?'","New sign could read 'Welcome to Dull, sister community of Boring'"

Disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong says he'll return to his bike later this month for a state-long trek across Iowa. Armstrong told the Des Moines Register that he and staffers from his Austin, Texas-based bicycle shop will ride for ‘three or four days’ in The Register’s Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa (RAGBRAI), an annual event sponsored by the newspaper that runs from the Missouri to Mississippi rivers. This will mark the fifth visit to RAGGRAI for Armstrong, who told interviewer Oprah Winfrey in January after years of denials that he doped for all seven of his Tour de France wins from 1999-2005. Armstrong says his impending trip to Iowa isn't a statement or an experiment. He says he simply wants to ride with what is typically ‘a friendly group of people that share the same interests.’ ‘I'm well aware my presence is not an easy topic, and so I encourage people if they want to give a high-five, great,’ Armstrong told reporters when asked about his decision to take part in the event. ‘If you want to shoot me the bird, that's OK too. I’m a big boy, and so I made the bed, I get to sleep in it.’ Race director T.J. Juskiewicz told the Register, ‘We are open to anyone that wants to come ride RAGBRAI.’ Last month rmstrong insisted that ‘it is impossible to win the Tour de France 'without doping.’ His words will infuriate British hero Sir Bradley Wiggins who last year became the first Englishman in history to win the epic race. Not giving up: Disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong says he'll return to his bike later this month for a state-long trek across Iowa . Disqualification: Armstrong won the Tour de France a record-breaking seven consecutive times between 1999 and 2005 before being disqualified for life for taking drugs . Armstrong won it a record-breaking seven consecutive times between 1999 and 2005 before being disqualified for life for taking drugs. Today Armstrong, 41, tells Le Monde: ‘It is impossible to win the Tour de France without doping. Because the Tour is an endurance test, where oxygen is crucial. ‘Just to give you one example – EPO [the blood booster erythropoietin] won’t help a sprinter win the 100 metres, but it will make all the difference for a runner doing the 10,000 metres. It’s obvious.’ The American was responding to the revelations that the 1998 French winner, Laurent Jalabert, used EPO. Traces have since been found in DNA samples taken from urine provided by Jalabert during the race. Speaking on the eve of this year’s race, Armstrong said that he ‘hadn’t invented doping’, adding: ‘Doping has always existed and it always will. I just participated in a system. I’m a human being.’ Questioned further about Jalabert, . who has denied all the accusations against him, Armstrong said: ‘I’ve . got a lot of respect for Jaja, but he’s lying.’ Armstrong . was banned from professional cycling in October 2012 when the US . Anti-Doping Agency, USADA, accused him of leading ‘the most . sophisticated, professional and successful doping program that sport has . ever seen.’ After . consistently denying the drug accusations for years, Armstrong finally . admitted what he had done, telling the Oprah Winfrey talk show: ‘It is . my fault. I view this situation as one big lie.’ Tension: His words will infuriate British hero Sir Bradley Wiggins who last year became the first Englishman in history to win the epic race . The American, seen left during one of his many Tour de France victories,  was responding to the revelations that the 1998 French winner, right, Laurent Jalabert, used EPO . Armstrong told Le Monde that he continues to train hard and will ‘try to watch some of the Tour de France on television’. Sir Bradley, who is out of this year's Tour because of an injury, has always insisted that he is completely clear of drugs. Armstrong was also forced to resign down from his Livestrong cancer foundation, which has raised millions for charity. Last month Nike cut ties with Livestrong after helping turn the foundation and its trademark yellow rubber wristbands into a global brand. The move by the sports shoe and clothing company ends a relationship that began in 2004 and helped the foundation raise more than $100million. Brood: Armstrong is pictured with his ex-wife Kristin and his other three children - son Luke and daughters Isabella Rose and Grace Elizabeth in 2003 after winning his fifth Tour de France . But the relationship soured with revelations that Armstrong and members of his legendary U.S. Postal Service team used performance-enhancing drugs. Nike said it will stop making its Livestrong line of apparel after the 2013 holiday season. Foundation and company officials said Nike will honor the financial terms of its contract until it expires in 2014. Nike dropped its personal sponsorship of Armstrong last October after U.S. Anti-Doping Agency exposed the team doping program and portrayed Armstrong as its ringleader. And after years of denials, Armstrong admitted earlier this year he used performance-enhancing drugs to win the Tour de France seven times. Officials at Livestrong, which announced the split on Tuesday, said the foundation remains strong and committed to helping cancer patients worldwide through its survivorship programs. Confession: Armstrong admitted to Oprah Winfrey that his seven Tour de France titles were won with the help of performance-enhancing drugs, but he denied that he used them for his 2009 comeback . Shamed: Armstrong told Oprah that he never tried to stop or change the culture of drug use in the sport . Armstrong, who started the charity in . 1997 as the Lance Armstrong Foundation, was pushed off the board of . directors in October and the organization later changed its formal name . to Livestrong. During a televised interview with Winfrey screened on January 17, he said 'I view this situation as one big lie that I repeated a lot of times.' He admitted that he doped in some . form for each of his seven Tour de France victories, though he . maintained that the last time that he 'crossed that line' was in 2005. The distinction of before and after . 2005 is important as that was the last year that capped off his . incredible seven-year winning streak at the Tour de France. Team Lance: Lance Armstrong said his former wife . Kristin, left in 2001, and his current girlfriend Anna Hansen, right in . 2011, were supportive of regarding his drugs admission in January . On top of the outright confession, he . said that part of the reason why it carried on for as long as it did . was because he 'didn't feel like' he was cheating. 'The definition of cheat is to gain . an advantage on a rival or foe that they didn't have. I didn't view it . that way. I viewed it as a level playing field,' he said. He described the elaborate doping . ring that he and his teammates developed was not quite as legendary as . the investigatory commissions described it. 'It was definitely professional and . it was definitely smart if you can call it that but it was very . conservative, very risk averse, and very aware of what mattered,' he . said. 'While I've lived through this process ... I know the truth the truth isn’t what is out there, the truth isn't what I said. 'I didn't invent the culture but I . didn't try to stop the culture and that's my mistake. The sport is now . paying the price for that, and I am sorry for that.

Glenn Beck got rid of his trademark blackboard for his latest performance as he headlined an event this weekend where he told his version of American history. The spectacle was deemed the 'Man in the Moon' show, as 18,000 people watched at an outdoor amphitheatre as a tuxedo-clad Beck narrated the show that was meant to 'help people see America’s history from a completely different point of view'. A replica moon was on stage as dancers, actors dressed as soldiers, and fireworks were all used in an effort to add theatrics to the event. WATCH THE VIDEO HERE . Setting the stage: Glenn Beck spoke from the stage and then later superimposed his face on the giant moon 'replica' in West Valley City on Saturday has he relayed his version of 'the history of the world' Selective history: The performance highlighted key moments that Beck believes were truly important, like the flood that led to Noah's Ark and Abraham Lincoln's freeing of the slaves . Beck is known for weaving his religious beliefs into his public presentations, so it comes as little surprise that there were 'biblical' elements to the way that he told his version of humanity. Beck, 49, is a converted Mormon and credits the church to helping him turn away from his drug and alcohol dependencies. Master of ceremonies: The Saturday event was just one in a series of massive public rallies held by the former Fox News commentator (pictured here in 2009) Though the Man in the Moon event was definitely the largest, it was just the latest in a string of public events and motivational speeches he headlined at different venues in Utah during the week of the Fourth of July. He considers himself to be a conservative politically with some libertarian views, but the heavy-handed religious elements to his moral speeches make it little surprise that his events are well-attended in Utah, which is largely populated by Mormons. The Salt Lake Tribune reports that the Saturday event began with two 'soldiers' walking towards the center of the stage upside down before unfurling an American flag, along with the haunting caption: 'Where were you when the world was turned upside-down?' The conservative host then came on stage and added his own ominous threat: 'I warn you, you are really, really not going to like how it ends.' From there, he went from being the sharply-dressed emcee to having his face super-imposed onto the replica moon, which was 35-feet in diameter, so that he could provide insights into how the 'beasts' of mankind became too greedy and invited a flood. References to Noah's ark and the Tower of Babel flowed freely. The focus then turned to slightly more modern history as he praised Abraham Lincoln for freeing the slaves, and dancers were called on stage to visually represent the creation of electricity. The 'Man in the Moon' then talked about World War II and the atom bomb that put an end to the fighting. Out with a bang: A fireworks display capped off the theatrical evening . The evening ended with some musings by Beck, where he said that more 'chapters' in earth's history are yet to be written. If the philosophical ideas were not enough to capture the attention of the 18,000 people in attendance at the USANA Amphitheatre in West Valley City, the fireworks display at the end certainly was. According to his website, the event was intended to be more than just a performance. 'The show was designed to tell the story of America, freedom, and man’s struggle between light and dark from the beginning of time until today,' his website says. The most recent chapters in the book of Beck's own life story led him in different paths than many would have expected after his wildly-popular Fox News show was cancelled in 2011. Quite the crowd: 18,000 people filled the UNASA Amphitheatre for the spectacle . At the time, Fox News chief Roger Ailes said that it was their divergent beliefs on where the show should go that led to the parting of the ways, but Beck seemed to think that it was because it had become almost too popular. 'This show has become a movement. It's not a TV show, and that's why it doesn't belong on television anymore. It belongs in your homes. It belongs in your neighborhoods,' Beck said. Since then, he has been hosting a daily program on his own internet subscription-based channel and giving motivational speeches across the country.","Former Fox News talk show host organized a massive event to show 'history from a completely different point of view'

Many black or racially mixed women in Venezuela are undergoing nose jobs in an effort to look whiter. A Dartmouth College study found that cosmetic surgery is on the rise in the South American country because women value whiteness and are obsessed with physical appearance. The rhinoplasty procedure, which women believe will give them 'the perfectly-formed nose', does however only temporarily improve their self-esteem and body image. Obsession: Venezuelan women obsessed with their physical appearance are . undergoing nose jobs to look more Caucasian and boost their self-esteem, . according to a new study (stock image) This fixation with how they look prompts many women to undergo cosmetic surgery such as face lifts, nose jobs and liposuction. The study, by assistant professor of anthropology Lauren Gulbas, looked at how British ideals of beauty affected ideas about race in Caracas, the capital of Venezuela. Focusing on rhinoplasty, the article, titled Embodying Racism: Race, Rhinoplasty, and Self-Esteem in Venezuela, included 63 white, black or racially mixed women. Out of these women, 24 had undergone rhinoplasty and 39 wanted to. Every single one of the women desired the perfect nose, which they described as tall, slender and associated with being white.

Gulbas says that Venezuelan national heritage prioritises European features such as light skin. 'Rhinoplasty is offered by physicians and interpreted by patients as a resolution to body dissatisfaction and low self-esteem. 'Patients' efforts to alter the nose reveal attempts to change not only how the body looks, but how it is lived. 'As a result, cosmetic surgery only acts as a stop-gap measure to heighten one's self-esteem and body image,' she writes. The new trend has, however, sparked . controversy and the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez even laid the blame . on cosmetic surgeons for putting pressure on Venezuelan women to . undergo treatments that they can't afford.

It reportedly cost $225million to produce but Disney's latest release - The Lone Ranger - has failed to excite movie-goers and has $16million of debt to claw back. Starring Jonny Depp, the producers simply thought their modern take on a western would appeal to a greater audience, but in fact, few under 25s have opted to see the film. Made by the same team that created the lucrative Disney franchise 'Pirates of the Caribbean' - the four film series that grossed $3.7 billion worldwide - the Western drew bad reviews and failed to capture the attention of younger moviegoers. Scroll down for video . In the red: Lone Ranger Jonny Depp has been beaten to the box office by kids' film Despicable Me 2 - leaving its producers with $16million debt . 'We thought it would appeal to a broader audience than it did,' Dave Hollis, head of distribution for Disney, said. Based on the long-running radio programme begun in 1933 and the TV series that debuted in 1949, the 'Lone Ranger' brand proved a musty one. The audience for the film skewed heavily toward older moviegoers, with 68 per cent of its audience older than 25. 'You think that you have everything in place,' said Hollis, listing the proven box-office commodities of Depp, Verbinski and producer Jerry Bruckheimer. 'Even when you have all the ingredients for what you think will be a four-quadrant, `everybody' picture, sometimes it doesn't work out that way.' The poor performance of 'The Lone Ranger"" called to mind a previous bomb for Disney: last year's similarly-budgeted science-fiction adventure ""John Carter,' which opened with $30.1 million. But 'The Lone Ranger', which stars Armie Hammer as the masked lawman, will likely fare better than that disappointment, since Depp's international star power should bring in better worldwide business. It started with $24.3 million abroad, opening in about 30 percent of its planned international market. Despicable Me 2: Domestic box office numbers so far suggest the animated minions, with a price tag one third of what 'The Lone Ranger' cost to make, is outperforming the masked man by more than three to one . While critics skewered the film, it did earn a decent B+ CinemaScore grade from moviegoers. But 'The Lone Ranger' is nevertheless likely to be a sizeable write-down for Disney and could impact the company's stock price when markets reopen Monday. 'Everybody beat up on The Lone Ranger pretty hard,' said Paul Dergarabedian, analyst for box-office tracker Hollywood.com. 'Everything was just not going in its favor.' Gore Verbinski's reimagining of the . iconic lawman bombed for the Walt Disney Co., opening with just $29.4million over the weekend, and a disappointing $48.9million since . Wednesday. On the other hand, Universal, which made sequel 'Despicable Me 2' for the comparatively small amount of $76million, took $82.5 million over the weekend and $142.1million across the five-day holiday window. Promoting: Jonny Depp, pictured in . Moscow last month promoting the Lone ranger, is the star of the Disney film . The better than expected haul (along with another $88.8 million overseas) establishes 'Despicable Me', which stars Steve Carell as a diabolical villain turned stay-at-home dad, as a new franchise for Universal and Chris Meledandri's Illumination Entertainment, the Universal-backed animation company. Nikki Rocco, head of distribution for Universal, attributed the strong performance to Meledandri, the robust appetite for summer family films, and, above all, those teaming little yellow guys. The 'minions' will get their own spin-off in 2014, and Rocco said another 'Despicable Me' film is a certainty. 'The minions steal everybody's heart,' Rocco said. 'It's a great time of the year to release a family film with broad appeal.' Stand-up Kevin Hart's concert documentary 'Kevin Hart: Let Me Explain' proved savvy counter-programming for Summit Entertainment, opening with $17.5million over five days and $10.1million over the weekend. Fox Searchlight's family comedy 'The Way, Way Back' (which also stars Carell) opened in 19 theaters with a strong theater average of about $30,000.

Bladder cancer can now be detected long before symptoms develop - after scientists created a device that can smell the disease . Due to later diagnosis, it is one of the most common causes of death in cancer patients. The device, known as the Odoreader, was inspired by a dog’s ability to detect smells that escape the human nose, including the scent of lung cancer. In a trial on 98 patients - 24 of whom had cancer - the sensor was 100 per cent accurate in identifying individuals with the disease. Larger clinical trials are now planned before the technique becomes publicly available. The researchers hope the technique can also be used to diagnose the early stages of prostate cancer. Researcher Professor Chris Probert, from the University of Liverpool’s Institute of Translational Medicine, said: ‘Each year approximately 10,000 people in the UK are diagnosed with bladder cancer. ‘It is a disease that, if caught early, can be treated effectively, but unfortunately we do not have any early screening methods other than diagnosis through urine tests at the stage when it starts to become a problem.’ Researchers from the UWE Bristol, the . University of Liverpool, and Bristol Urological Institute have spent . four years developing the Odoreader. The . device contains a sensor that responds to chemicals in a patient’s . urine. Scientists are then able to read the profile to diagnose the . presence of cancer cells in the bladder. Responding to chemicals in a patient's urine, the sensor is able to give an accurate diagnosis within 30 minutes . Researcher Professor Norman Ratcliffe from the Institute of Biosensor Technology at UWE Bristol said: ‘It is thought that dogs can smell cancer, but this is obviously not a practical way for hospitals to diagnose the disease. ‘Taking this principle, however, we have developed a device that can give us a profile of the odour in urine. It reads the gases that chemicals in the urine can give off when the sample is heated. ‘Odoreader works by inserting a bottle containing the urine sample into the device. About 30 minutes later the Odoreader is capable of showing the diagnosis on the computer screen if the sample derives from a patient with bladder cancer. It is simple to use and could be operated in a doctor’s surgery.’ The study is published in the journal Public Library of Science ONE.","Odoreader can detect the disease in a patient's urine .

The 2-year-old girl who was the youngest person to ever receive a bio-engineered organ has died two months after doctors implanted her with a new windpipe. Hannah Warren was born without a windpipe and underwent an experimental procedure to be implanted with one made from stem cells. The procedure took place on April 9, and the spokesman for the Children's Hospital of Illinois announced that she died on Saturday. New windpipe: In this April 26, 2013 photo provided by OSF Saint Francis Medical Center in Peoria, Ill., Hannah Warren, 2, lies in bed in a post-op room at the Children's Hospital of Illinois in Peoria, after having received a new windpipe . The hospital says in a statement that Hannah couldn't 'overcome additional health issues that were identified as her care progressed.' The stem cells came from Hannah's bone marrow, extracted with a special needle inserted into her hip bone. They were seeded in a lab onto a plastic scaffold, where it took a few days for them to multiply and create a new windpipe. Hannah was born in South Korea and traveled to Illinois for the surgery. Her family has asked for privacy. Brave: The little girl is recovering with her parents, left, after the nine-hour surgery on April 9 . Hannah was unable to breathe, eat, drink or swallow on her own since she was born in South Korea in 2010. Until the April 9 operation at the Children's Hospital of Illinois, the toddler had spent her entire life in a hospital in Seoul. Doctors there told her parents there was no hope and they expected her to die. The stem cells came from Hannah's bone marrow, extracted with a special needle inserted into her hip bone. They were seeded in a lab onto a plastic scaffold, where it took less than a week for them to multiply and create a new windpipe. About the size of a 3-inch tube of penne pasta, it was implanted in a nine-hour procedure. Early signs indicate the windpipe showed it as working, but she remained on a ventilator for weeks following the procedure. Miracle: Hannah Warren, 2, pictured with her parents Lee Young-mi and Darryl Warren at Seoul National University Hospital in Seoul, South Korea, piror to the breakthrough surgery . Only about one in 50,000 children worldwide are born with the windpipe defect. The stem-cell technique has been used to make other body parts besides windpipes and holds promise for treating other birth defects and childhood diseases, her doctors said. The operation brought together an . Italian surgeon based in Sweden who pioneered the technique, a pediatric . surgeon at Children's Hospital of Illinois in Peoria who met Hannah's . family while on a business trip to South Korea, and Hannah — born to a . Newfoundland man and Korean woman who married after he moved to that . country to teach English. Hannah's . parents had read about Dr. Paolo Macchiarini's success using stem-cell . based tracheas but couldn't afford to pay for the operation at his . center, the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. Breakthrough: Surgeons perform a landmark windpipe transplant operation on Hannah Warren, 2, at Children's Hospital of Illinois in Peoria on April 9, 2013 . So Dr. Mark Holterman . helped the family arrange to have the procedure at his Peoria hospital, . bringing in Macchiarini to lead the operation. Children's Hospital . waived the cost, likely hundreds of thousands of dollars, Holterman . said. Part of OSF Saint Francis Medical Center, the Roman Catholic hospital considers the operation part of their mission to provide charity care, but also views it as a way to champion a type of stem-cell therapy that doesn't involve human embryos, the surgeons said. The Catholic church opposes using stem cells derived from human embryos in research or treatment. Macchiarini has been involved in 14 . previous windpipe operations using patients' own stem cells — five using . man-made scaffolds like Hannah's but in adults; and nine using . scaffolds made from cadaver windpipes, including one in a 10-year-old . British boy. Tears of joy: Darryl Warren and his wife, Lee Young-mi, tearfully stand on Tuesday April 30, 2013, after being introduced at a press conference in at Children's Hospital of Illinois, in Peoria, Ill. Doctors: Dr. Paolo Macchiarini, center, holds a replica of a windpipe like that implanted in little Hannah at a news conference today . He . said only one patient died, a 30-year-old man from Abingdon, Maryland, who . had the operation in November 2011 to treat late-stage cancer of the . windpipe. He died about four months later of uncertain causes, . Macchiarini said. Similar methods have been used to grow bladders, urethras and last year a girl in Sweden got a lab-made vein using her own stem cells and a cadaver vein. Scientists hope to eventually use the method to create solid organs, including kidneys and livers, said Dr. Anthony Atala, director of Wake Forest University's Institute for Regenerative Medicine. He said the operation on Hannah Warren 'is really showing that the technique is workable.' Hannah had breathing difficulties at birth and Korean doctors soon discovered the missing windpipe. They reconfigured her esophagus so that a breathing tube could go down it from her mouth to her lungs. The esophagus normally runs behind the windpipe and carries food to the stomach.","Hannah Warren was born without a windpipe in 2010 and was unable to breathe, eat, drink or swallow on her own since birth .

Michael Bloomberg's daughter has embarrassed him yet again after claiming his record on animal welfare is a 'failure.' Georgina Bloomberg, who is pregnant by her Argentinian boyfriend Ramiro Quintana, said that her father's 'government doesn't care about animals' in a stinging attack on his time as mayor of New York. She said that not enough people are adopting animals in the city because the shelters for unwanted pets are unappealing and put off potential owners. Miss Bloomberg also called for a ban on horse-drawn carriages in Central Park - even though her father supports them. Ouch: Michael Bloomberg's daughter Georginia Bloomberg, pictured, has embarrassed him yet again after claiming his record on animal welfare is a 'failure' The comments from Miss Bloomberg, 30, a strident animal rights campaigner, are likely to spark more lively debate over the dinner table with her dad. She has already raised eyebrows by writing a novel about a wealthy family in New York riven with squabbles over money and sibling rivalry. The equestrian drama is built around a plain-speaking billionaire who 'owns half of New York' and lives in Manhattan. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Miss Bloomberg, who has an older sister, Emma, 34, attacked Animal Care & Control, a nonprofit group which Mr Bloomberg's office commissioned to run New York's animal shelter system. As part of its contract with the city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, Animal Care & Control must rescue, care and home abandoned animals. Not doing enough: Georgina, pictured left and right, said not enough people are adopting animals in the city because the shelters for unwanted pets are unappealing and put off potential owners . Miss Bloomberg however said that animal welfare is low on the list of priorities for her father. She said that Animal Care & Controls shelter are not 'a place where people want to go to adopt animals, which, to me, is a failure.' Miss Bloomberg also claimed that the organization is failing to raise enough money because few have faith in it - including potential donors. Turning her fire on the horse drawn carriages in Central Park, Miss Bloomberg added that contrary to her father, she thinks they should be banned. She said: 'Obviously, for me, my heart is always with the horses and I always want them to be kept in the best condition possible, which I don't believe they are. 'Maybe the time has come for them to go.' Boyfriend: Georgina is pregnant to her Argentinian boyfriend, Ramiro Quintana, pictured . Miss Bloomberg added that she understands that some people depend on the horses for their livelihood, but claimed that 'if it's just about the horses' then they should not be allowed to continue. Critics are likely to see her comments as biting the hand that feeds her once again. Mr Bloomberg, 71, has indulged his daughter's passion for equestrian and paid for at least six horses, which she keeps on estates in North Salem, New York, and Wellington, Florida. The family also have a lavish property portfolio including neighboring waterfront homes in Bermuda for Miss Bloomberg. The Bloombergs are amongst the richest people in America and Mr Bloomberg has an estimated personal fortune of $18.1 billion earned through his eponymous financial information company. But their personal lives were thrown into the spotlight two years ago when Miss Bloomberg published her novel 'The A Circuit.' Embarrassing: The Bloombergs' personal lives were thrown into the spotlight two years ago when Miss Bloomberg published her novel 'The A Circuit' The book concerns Wall St billionaire Rick Aaronson, his two daughters and their family squabbles. His eldest daughter Camille went to an Ivy League colleague and wants to move into politics. His youngest daughter Tommi is an award-winning horse rider who refuses to do what her father tells her. 'She wasn't afraid to say no to her father,' Tommi says in the book. 'Even if half of Wall Street was.' By coincidence, Miss Bloomberg's sister Emma went to Princeton and now works with her father City Hall in New York. Another parallel is Miss Bloomberg's own interest in horses. The hobby is how she met her boyfriend Ramiro Quintana, 36, who is also an equestrian. A spokesman for Mr Bloomberg declined to comment. Risa Weinstock, Animal Care & Control's executive director, told the Wall St Journal: 'Our efforts to find homes for abandoned pets have more than doubled animal placements while reducing euthanization by two-thirds over the last 10 years.'","Georgina Bloomberg has launched a stinging attack on her father, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg .

A surfer thought to have died in a shark attack had in fact committed suicide, a coroner has found. The body Brandon Beaver, 42, was found near a beach in San Diego last month, covered in shark bites, and investigators initially believed the predators were the cause of his death. An autopsy has now revealed that Beaver, from Southern California, committed suicide and was dead prior to the shark attack. 'There was no evidence whatsoever that his death was due to shark attack, as all findings indicated postmortem marine animal activity,' the autopsy reports. Adding to the intrigue about a . possible cause of death, NBC San Diego says that the coroner's office . asserts that he was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol when he . decided to take off his wetsuit and wrap it around his board. Mr . Beaver's fiancee said that he did have a history of mental illness- . including bipolar disorder- and depression, and had suicidal thoughts in . the past. She said at the time of his disappearance, he was stressed due to financial and familial problems.

Cancer: Sabawi Ibrahim al-Hassan, who had received several death sentences, was transferred to the hospital from prison as his health deteriorated . Saddam Hussein's half brother, facing the gallows for his role as chief of the regime's security service, has died of cancer in a Baghdad hospital. Sabawi Ibrahim al-Hassan, who had received several death sentences, was transferred to the hospital from prison as his health deteriorated. His body will be handed over to his family. Al-Hassan, a maternal half brother of Hussein, had lived in exile for a period after the 2003 invasion. He was suspected of directing and financing insurgency operations from Syria carried out by Saddam loyalists in Iraq since the fall of the regime. A $1million reward was offered for information that led to either his capture or death. In 2005 he was captured and deported to Iraq by the Syrian government. Sources at the time said Syria acted under pressure from the international community, and that he was captured close to the Iraqi border. Iraqi troops then handed him over the the U.S. Al-Hassan was No. 36 on the U.S. list of the 55 most-wanted Iraqis at the time. His photo appeared as the Six of Diamonds in decks of playing cards distributed featuring members of Saddam's deposed regime. Under Saddam, al-Hassan served as head of the country's intelligence and security service, known as the Mukhabarat, during the 1991 Gulf War. He then ran the general security service until 1996, when he took up his final post of presidential adviser to Saddam. In March 2009, Sabawi Ibrahim al-Hassan was sentenced to death by hanging. Reports say that as his death sentence was read out, he stood up and proclaimed 'God is great' and that he was 'proud to be a martyr'. His son, Ayman Sabawi Ibrahim, was arrested in Saddam's hometown of Tikrit and was sentenced to life in prison, but escaped in northern Iraq in late 2006. Hanged: Pictured at his failed appeal of his sentence, Saddam Hussein, Al-Hassan's half brother, was hanged in 2006 for the killing of 148 Iraqi Shi'ites . Al-Hassan's brothers Watban Ibrahim Hassan al-Tikriti and Barzan Ibrahim Hassan al-Tikriti were also captured and tried for their involvement in mass killings during the Baathist regime. Barzan, who was a leading figure in the intelligence service and later the secret police, was hanged in January 2007 and was decapitated because of a miscalculation of the length of rope. Watban, who was reportedly shot nine times by Saddam's son Uday Hussein, and survived, after an argument in 1996 over popularity, was also captured and tried and sentenced to execution by hanging in March 2009. Despite being handed over by U.S. to Iraqi authorities in July 2011, he is believed to be still awaiting the death sentence.

Julie hopes her unusual work will alter some outdated perceptions that sharks are mindless killers. And with 73million sharks being killed every year, she has vowed to continue working tirelessly to halt the slaughter. She added: 'Love them or hate them, we need sharks on this planet because they keep the ocean healthy - and the oceans keep us healthy. Our food, our weather, our air, even the removal of carbon dioxide, is governed by the oceans. 'So if sharks aren't in the oceans, then the oceans are sick - and that means we're sick.'

That sinking feeling: A vacuum truck is used to clean up crude oil that has risen to the surface of an approximate 22-acre sinkhole in Bayou Corne, Louisiana . Should I stay or should I go? Kenny Simoneaux looks out the door of the camper he is living in, in a campground in Pierre Part, Louisiana, after being displaced by the mandatory evacuation from the 22-acre sinkhole . Mother nature: The sinkhole resulted from a collapsed underground salt dome cavern about 40 miles south of Baton Rouge. Oil and natural gas came oozing up and acres of swampland liquefied into muck . The sinkhole, discovered August. 3rd last year resulted from a collapsed underground salt dome cavern about 40 miles south of Baton Rouge. After oil and natural gas came oozing up and acres of the swampland liquefied into muck, the community's 350 residents were advised to evacuate. Texas Brine Co., the operator of the salt dome, is negotiating buyouts of residents who have not joined lawsuits filed against the company. Texas Brine spokesman Sonny Cranch said 92 buyout offers have been made, with 44 accepted so far. The Mistrettas, retired educators, are taking the buyout offer. Displaced: Bayou Corne's 350 residents were advised to evacuate. Texas Brine Company, the operator of the salt dome, is negotiating buyouts of residents who have not joined lawsuits against the company . On the bayou: These houses are under a mandatory evacuation order . Richie, a high school literacy teacher, and her husband are part of a class-action lawsuit that's scheduled for trial next year. Both families have bought new houses, in Ascension and Assumption parishes. After two decades together in Bayou Corne, they won't be neighbors anymore. 'We just feel that this place is not ever going to be what it once was,' said Bucky Mistretta. 'It was just a beautiful, pristine place on the bayou. And now that's gone, and we just don't feel safe about what's underneath us.' Residents who want to stay are wrestling with the same fears as their fleeing neighbors: Is it safe? Will the slow-growing sinkhole undermine the area's infrastructure, including Louisiana 70? And will the natural gas bubbling to the surface on the bayou accumulate in confined spaces and cause an explosion? Although parish officials have said they don't think either will happen, they are monitoring both issues. Patching up: Texas Brine, Inc. spokesperson Sonny Cranch highlights work being done to remediate the sinkhole . Cleaning up: A contractor uses a net to keep floating debris away from a vacuum that is sucking up crude oil that has risen to the surface of the sinkhole . Gas has been detected under at least four homes on the north side of the community, but the levels were low, said John Boudreaux, director of the Assumption Parish Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness. Officials expect the sinkhole area to stabilize once debris fills the void created by the collapsed cavern. However, the land has continued to shift and the hole has continued to grow. A salt dome is a large, naturally occurring underground salt deposit. Companies drill on the dome's outskirts to create caverns in which to extract brine that is used in the petrochemical refining process, or for storage of such things as hydrocarbons. Officials say a cavern was being mined too close to the edge of the Napoleon Salt Dome, which caused the 'unprecedented' side wall collapse. The state fined the company $260,000 last year for its slow response in following state directives to build a containment berm around the sinkhole and to install air monitoring devices in homes. Aerial view of the Assumption Parish Sinkhole: Officials expect the sinkhole area to stabilize once debris fills the void created by the collapsed cavern. However, the land has continued to shift and the hole has continued to grow . Ever closer: While the parish has issued an evacuation order based on safety concerns, officials are not forcing anyone to leave. But they have informed residents of the potential risks . Dennis Landry, a 20-year property owner who developed and sold the lots in his subdivision and who owns a boat launch business that fronts Sportsman Drive, is staying put despite the sinkhole. 'It's hard to leave a beautiful little bayou paradise unless you feel it's absolutely necessary, and thus far, we're just hanging on,' he said. 'We go to the meetings. We get daily reports. We check the blog for any information. We have gas monitors inside of our homes. We just take it day by day.' Louisiana Highway 70 divides this pint-sized community of trailers, wood and brick homes. The south side is newer, sports an upscale subdivision of 22 houses and has Bayou Corne flowing through the backyards. With street names like Crawfish Stew, Sauce Piquante, Bream Street and Sportsman Drive, it's clear that the bayou flowing through en route to Lake Verret is the main draw for many of the residents. Boats and campers are a fixture in most driveways, whether paved concrete or a bed of rocks. The 'no trespassing' signs in many yards, however, are new. After 26 years, Kenneth Simoneaux said he is ready to leave his acre of lush land bordering a narrow canal that empties into Bayou Corne. He and his wife are living in a 29-foot camper trailer in what he calls 'a concrete village' in nearby Pierre Part. 'I never thought anybody could push me to the point where I would actually be ashamed to admit where I live,' he said, sitting on a folding chair outside his trailer. 'I was so proud of my home. I'm lost.' Landry lives on the south side of the highway and thinks a majority of the residents in the subdivision don't want to move. A few, mainly those with young children, will probably leave, he said. The close-knit, peaceful and family friendly community will change, Landry said. No one knows yet what will become of the vacant, bought-out property. Will houses be torn down and made into green space? Will they be occupied or left vacant? Neverending task: Oil is being cleaned up. The residents are given daily reports and have gas monitors inside of their homes. 'We just take it day by day,' one resident said . Building on the bayou: a truck hauling dirt rides along a berm set up to contain the sinkhole. The state fined the company $260,000 last year for its slow response in following state directives to build a containment berm . Cranch said Texas Brine hasn't decided what will become of the properties it buys. 'Unfortunately and sadly enough, I think we are going to witness the partial destruction and elimination of a wonderful little community here on the bayou,' Landry said. Describing the house, friends and community she will leave behind, Richie said, 'It's like a funeral.' While the parish has issued an evacuation order based on safety concerns, officials are not forcing anyone to leave. But they have informed residents of the potential risks, Boudreaux said. 'Everyone has a different risk tolerance,' he said. For Richie and the Mistrettas who live on the north side, it's the thought of the unexpected that's driving their decision to pack up and go. 'In a way, I guess we were lucky because we could have gotten swallowed up like that poor man in Florida did,' Joanie Mistretta said, referring to 37-year-old Jeffrey Bush who was killed by a sinkhole last March. 'And that's what we think could happen here.' The gas accumulation scares Richie. Monitors already have picked up the presence of gas under a slab house located across the street from her. 'Maybe nothing's ever going to happen. Maybe the ground is just going to start sinking below us,' Richie said. 'I can't stay with all those unknowns. It's like what's next?'","Residents of Bayou Corne, Louisiana have to decide: should they pack up and move, or stay put and sue?

Parsons, who has a respectable stint with Vivienne Westwood under her belt,  gave up modelling full-time after securing a job presenting for MTV. Today she spoke of the pressure to stay slim within the industry, and announced she is going on a strict, £236.35 Nosh juice fast and joining the gym in order to lose weight. Lilah, who has been told to slim, picturedat the Yahoo! Wireless Festival Pre-Party last month . Parsons is listed as having a 26-inch waist and 37-inch hips on the Models 1 website, a slim size 10. But she says she has put on a little weight recently, and drifted up to a size 10-12. After being given the news by her agency, Parsons signed up for membership at Virgin Active, as confirmed with Max Clifford Associates, who represents her TV work. She has also bought a Nosh juice diet package and confirms she will be starting her strict no-solid menu regime week. Lilah admits she has gone up to a size 10-12 recently, but is still happy with the way she looks. Though to be told she won't get the work without losing weight 'obviously hurt'. She joined a gym which is 'just at the top of the road, so no excuses not go'. Lilah has committed further to her goals by signing up with a personal trainer who will help target the areas she wants to attack. Lilah at the OK! Tigers & Tiaras Summer Ball, held at the London Zoo in London, UK on June 25 . The Nosh juice diet starts on Monday . and will last for five days in the run up to her presenting from . Wireless next weekend. No solid foods are allowed. Four delicious smoothies a day is all you need to have the perfect hour-glass figure, say the Nosh team... Our clients have shown over years that the 6-day juice fast program is 'one of the healthiest and safest ways to achieve steady weight loss on the market today'. The juice diet programme requires you to drink two litres of freshly-prepared juices every day for six days. Each smoothie is rich in antioxidants and assists your body to detox naturally. This, in turn, speeds up the process of regeneration and rejuvenation. Benefits include: . • Helps maintain high energy levels since all the smoothies contain fruit pulp and fibre.• Assists the body in attaining its natural balance by detoxifying and cleansing thoroughly.• Increases the metabolic rate, thus helping in digesting food quickly and eliminating waste material regularly.• The extra weight can be kept at bay for a longer time period than is possible through traditional diet methods. The juice diet retrains your body and improves your overall dietary patterns. From the Nosh website . Lilah admits she is 'worried' about . five whole days on just juice, but 'apparently they are laden with calories to . help you feel satisfied'. ‘I love food, especially pizza, but . next week I am only allowed to have this yucky juice,’ she told a Daily . Mail reporter at a Mayfair preview party Staying Alive for artists . Christian Furr and . Chris Bracey. 'Let's face it, I’m never going to be . one of those emaciated model girls, but my agency wants me to lose . weight. 'Hopefully when I lose some more weight I will get more jobs, but in the meantime dieting is going to be hell.' Speaking about money, Lilah added: 'Everyone thinks that if . you're on the TV, you're loaded - but I'm not! I travel by tube and I'm . often really sweaty when I arrive at glamorous parties. 'I borrow cash from the bank of mum and dad, but then I have to give it back!' She has started eating healthily this . week in preparation for the body-blitzing, and says she feels more energetic . and her clothes feel a little bit looser. She said she would like to lose at . least half a stone. 'I am a size 10-12 and I want to be a size 8-10. In reality, as model, you should be a size 8,' she said. Parsons 'loves' food and does not . believe in 'irresponsible' dieting - but has put herself on a five-day . juice regime, joined the gym and got a personal trainer because she . wants to continue modelling.

Hirsute pursuit: A woman looks on admiringly while stroking Chillie the llama's fine coat at the hotel's Inca suite . Owner Mary Walker's family-run . business has only just been launched and promises guests a night to . remember. The family, who also run the Llama Karma Kafe where people can eat their lunch with llamas - as well as a llama trekking centre on the same site - came up with the idea after spotting a gap in the llama market. Ms Walker said: 'Everyone who meets the llamas wants to take them home.' 'It’s very quirky and different because it looks South American and everything has been designed to fit in with the theme of llamas' home soil.'

'The ground floor rooms have big glass French door window and we have taken down the dry stone wall outside so that the llamas can get right up to the house. Ms Walker, 59, said: 'We have styled it in a Peruvian-Moroccan theme, and used mosaics and rich colours to make the place feel really authentic.

She added: 'It’s so unusual because of the way that it has been done, and you can see all of the animals from your window.' Llamas are domesticated South American camelids, which when fully grown, can stand at heights of up to six foot. They are very social animals and live with other llamas in a herd. Due to their intelligence they can learn simple tasks very quickly. Llamas are well-socialised and trained to halter and lead after weaning and are very friendly and pleasant to be around.

We all know that the most effective ways to lose weight is by doing more and eating less but many people can't muster the motivation to step foot in the gym or go on that first run. Now one woman has found a simple way of motivating herself to keep fit - by being hypnotised in to wanting to exercise . 27-year-old Danielle Davies hated exercise but she has shed an amazing five stone after being hypnotised into a doing a string of energetic workouts. New-found fitness fanatic: Danielle Davies, 27, has transformed the way she looks using Hypnocise- a new technique that uses hypnotherapy to help you exercise . The teaching assistant, 27, used to recoil at thought of any exercise - despite tipping the scales at 14 stone due to her love of alcohol and takeaways. But her mother, Bev, 49, who has worked as hypnotherapist for 20 years decided she had to help her daughter who she believed was putting her life at risk. First she hypnotised her into believing she had a gastric band fitted, then she bewitched her into doing exercises in a fitness programme she called 'hypnocise.' Bev would play her daughter a hypnotherapy CD, which prepared her both mentally and physically - sparking Danielle into completing workout sessions which ended up lasting up to 60 minutes. Shedding the pounds: Danielle went from a size 18 weighing 14 stone, to a size six weighing eight stone, by using a virtual gastric band and Hypnocise . Convert: The teaching assistant, 27, used to recoil at thought of any exercise - despite tipping the scales at 14 stone due to her love of alcohol and takeaways but now she can't get enough . Now 5ft 5” tall Danielle can fit into the slinkiest of size six dresses and loves to show off her incredible figure after weighing in at nine stone. The new fitness fanatic says she can feel her muscles tensing even before she has started doing the exercise, as just listening to the CD can make her feel as though she has already done 100 crunches. Danielle, from Rotherham, South Yorks said: ‘I was the laziest person I knew, I hated exercise and could never be bothered. ‘But with hypnocise it’s really different, it puts all the thoughts and motivation into your mind and gets you ready to exercise. ‘It’s crazy, I can feel my body preparing itself. I’ll think about doing crunches and it will feel as if I’ve already done some. Gaining weight: After getting her first job and moving in with her friends at 19-years-old, Danielle began to pile on the pounds as she gorged on takeaways every night and drank alcohol every weekend . ‘It puts suggestions in your mind that you want to exercise and tells you how much better you will feel for it. ‘It sounds insane but it really works, my body shape has changed completely. ‘People think I’m a gym nut or someone who goes on really long runs but all I do is half an hour to an hour each night at home.’ After getting her first job and moving in with her friends at 19-years-old, Danielle began to pile on the pounds as she gorged on takeaways every night and drank alcohol every weekend. But Danielle didn’t notice her changing figure until people started to make comments on her size - with an old friend even stopping her in the street to say she was worried about her health and overhearing men in clubs calling her ‘fatty.’ Danielle listens to the Hypnocise CD before she works out which puts thoughts into her mind that she wants to get fit, motivated and feel like she has more energy - preparing her to work out. Unaware: Danielle didn't notice her changing figure until people started to make comments on her size - with an men in clubs calling her 'fatty'. Now she is a svelte size 6 . Now Danielle says she can’t go a single day without exercising or she becomes irritable and moody. Danielle said: 'At the time I lived with my friends, when I started putting weight on, I was probably in my late teens. 'I had a job and I had money for the first time and I lived on takeaways, all the worst kinds of food. 'I would have breakfast and then a snack and then dinner and then I’d snack through until tea, which would probably be a takeaway. It was always convenience food. 'I was going through that time in your life when you suddenly have a job and money and I started to go out with my friends and drink. 'I always used to feel like the ugly one but now I feel incredible' 'It was all a novelty, it was all new and exciting. And the weight just slowly crept on. I just didn’t realise what was happening, I didn’t see it creeping on. 'I didn’t realise at first and then people started to make comments when I was in my early 20s. I think the first one I really remember was when I bumped into an old . school friend and she said she worried about me because of my size. 'She wasn’t being mean or anything, I do think she was genuinely concerned. I was putting my life at risk and in the end I realised something had to change. 'My mum just made it so much easier for me because I found it hard to be motivated. Now I love going out with my friends and showing off my figure. 'I always used to feel like the ugly one but now I feel incredible.' Bev, who is using the technique with . other clients, said: 'I was worried about Danielle’s fitness- her weight . was reducing but she still wasn’t anywhere near as fit as she should . be. New woman: 'I always used to feel like the ugly one but now I feel incredible,' she said after being hynotised into loving exercise . 'The HypnoGastricband helped her achieve her weight loss but I needed to get her motivated into exercising. 'When I did her first Hypnocise session I incorporated a short workout which we did together, then I repeated the same under hypnosis.

Gassing: Missouri prisoners on death row could face the gas chamber when drug supplies run out . Prisoners on death row in Missouri are facing possible execution in the gas chamber due to a dwindling supply of lethal-injection drugs in the state. The state’s attorney general, Chris Koster, is pressuring the Supreme Court into carrying out pending executions under its current lethal-injection protocol before the drug supplies run out. It comes in the wake of a boycott on sales of medical drugs for executions by drugs companies in the U.S, Europe and Asia, which have refused on ethical grounds to sell their products to corrections departments. The European Commission has also imposed tougher restrictions on the export of anaesthetics to the U.S, banning the export of drugs for lethal injection in 2011, under the EU Torture Regulation. In a statement this week, Koster said the state will be forced to start using the gas chamber as an alternative. ‘Unless . the [supreme] court changes its current course, the legislature will . soon be compelled to fund statutorily-authorised alternative methods of . execution to carry out lawful judgments,’ Koster said. Under . Missouri law only two forms of execution are permitted, ‘by means of . the administration of lethal gas or by means of the administration of . lethal injection’, he said. After . switching from hanging in 1937 as its preferred method of judicial . killing, the gas chamber has not been used in the state since 1965. The . use of lethal injection was first used in Texas in 1982. Strapped down: Prisoners are normally killed by lethal injection but that might change soon . Lethal injection: Propofol is the drug used to kill death row inmates in the one-injection protocol, only enforced in the state of Missouri. The drug also killed pop icon, Michael Jackson . Death row: The prisoners awaiting execution in Missouri challenged the one-injection protocol with propofol saying it causes 'excruciating pain' Chris Koster, the Attorney General of Missouri, wants to bring back the gas chamber . Two methods of lethal injection exist . today, one using a three-drug protocol and another using one large dose . of a barbiturate or propofol – the latter being the drug that the ‘King . of Pop’, Michael Jackson, overdosed on. Last year Missouri became the only state in the country to apply the execution protocol using just one large dose of propofol. However, . the new protocol was challenged by 21 of the state’s death row inmates, . who argued it was a violation of the US constitution as it created the . likelihood of ‘foreseeable infliction of excruciating pain in the course . of executing the plaintiffs’, according to The Guardian. That . caused the Missouri supreme court to refuse to schedule any more . execution dates until the question of the constitutionality of the new . method of death is settled. But now the state's limited supply of propofol is running out. According to Koster, the Department of Corrections has only three quantities of propofol remaining. The oldest quantity expires this October, the next batch expires in May 2014, and the newest supply expires in 2015. Earlier this week, on July 1, Koster filed new motions asking the judges to give him the green light to carry out the executions of two death row inmates, Joseph Paul Franklin and Allen Nicklasson, before the drugs expire. Killers: Chris Koster is calling for the immediate execution of death row inmates, Franklin Joseph (left), who murdered 20 people, and Allen Nicklasson, who killed three . Fraklin, 63, is a serial killer who has been linked to 20 murders, six aggravated assaults, 16 bank robberies and two bombings. Nicklasson, 42, killed three people in 1994 who had offered to help him when his car broke down on the road to Kansas City. ‘Not only has the delay prevented those affected by Mr Nicklasson’s crimes from receiving the closure they deserve, it has also put at risk the  State’s ability to administer capital punishment at all,’ said Koster in the motion. Richard Dieter, of the Death Penalty Information Center, said he believes the threats of bringing back the gas chamber are a political ploy, directed at the state supreme court. ‘He's trying to prod the court into dropping its objections and setting execution dates by threatening that Missouri might have to go back to the dark ages if they don't act soon,"" Dieter told The Guardian. Each state that employs lethal injection is legally required to have detailed protocols for its practice, and though the set of rules differ from state to state, the process of killing a condemned inmate varies little. It begins with the lethal injection team securing the inmate to a gurney and connecting him to an electrocardiogram (EKG) machine that monitors heart activity. Inserted into the inmate's veins are two intravenous lines (one as a backup) that lead out of a separate infusion room, where members of the intravenous team monitor the initial harmless saline drip. At the warden's signal, the execution chamber is exposed to witnesses in an adjoining room, and in states that use the three-drug protocol the inmate is injected with sodium thiopental or pentobarbital, anesthetics intended to put the inmate to sleep. Presumably after a member of the intravenous team determines the inmate is sufficiently unconscious, he is then injected with pancuronium bromide, which paralyses the entire muscle system and stops the inmate's breathing. In most cases, the inmate's consciousness is again checked, and finally potassium chloride stops his heart. In ideal circumstances, death results from anesthetic overdose and respiratory and cardiac arrest while the condemned person is unconscious. The process of lethal injection using just one drug follows nearly the same procedure, except the inmate dies from the one large dose of anesthetic, either sodium thiopental or pentobarbital.","Attorney General, Chris Koster, calls for immediate execution of two convicted murderers, Joseph Paul Franklin and Allen Nicklasson, before drugs expire .

Alex Salmond today tried to laugh off complaints about his decision to unfurl a Scottish Saltire in Centre Court, insisting Wimbledon rules were there to be broken. The Scottish First Minister was accused of staging a political stunt by smuggling the flag in his wife's handbag before waving around behind David Cameron's head as Andy Murray secured his historic win. He insisted no-one sticks to the rule banning large flags around Centre Court, and after waiting 117 years for a Scot to win the men's singles 'a few Saltires hoisted over Wimbledon doesn’t really harm at all'. PR stunt? Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond waving a giant Scottish flag, breaking Wimbledon spectator rules . What have you got there? The First Minister looks set to unfurl his giant Saltire as David Cameron glances behind to see what's going on . The stunt was seen as particularly controversial coming less than 18 months before Scotland votes on leaving the rest of the United Kingdom. Some will hope that Mr Salmond's push for independence will be bolstered by Murray's victory over Novak Djokovic in straight sets last night. But his decision to wave the blue and white Scottish flag around was not seen as being particularly statesmanlike, hiding a flag in the handbag of his wife Moira. The moment the nation was gripped by Andy Murray's historic Wimbledon victory, the First Minister of Scotland was rummaging in his wife's handbag. Alex Salmond knew a Scot triumphing in the greatest tennis contest on earth presented him with a PR coup and he was going to take it. Even better was the chance to dangle the Saltire behind David Cameron's head. But the row that has erupted is about more than whether it was statesmanlike behaviour. On 18 September 2014 Scotland will stage a referendum on leaving the United Kingdom after 300 years, and Mr Salmond is desperate to prove an independent Scotland can compete on the world stage. He will hope that Murray's victory will bolster his chances of reversing dire opinion polls which suggest his dream of independence will be defeated. Murray has refused to be drawn on it, insisting he wants to 'read more about the issue'. The vast Saltire also appeared to far exceed All England Club rules which forbid flags more than 2ft by 2ft. The regulations also ban objects or . clothing bearing political statements or commercial identification . intended for ‘ambush marketing’. But Mr Salmond claimed no-one stuck to the rules. 'I think a rule more observed in its breaking than its observation. 'But can I just point out, the All . England Club didn’t mind in the slightest, they’re really nice people, . and if the All England Club didn’t mind, I really don’t think anybody . else should either.' He also argued he should be given some leeway, with Murray the first Scot to win Wimbledon for 117 years. Mr Salmond told BBC Radio 4's Today . programme: 'You’ve just been saying about it’s the first triumph since . Fred Perry in 77 years. 'It’s the first Scot since Harold . Mahony in 1896 – it’s not something that happens very often, so I think a . few saltires hoisted over Wimbledon doesn’t really harm at all. 'This was after the match was . finished, incidentally. This was part of the celebration. 'And the answer . is no, I am not responsible for the seating arrangements in the royal . box. 'I had the flag last year, actually – I just didn’t get the chance . to wave it last year.' However the incident provoked a flurry of . comment on Twitter, where it was described as an instance of . ‘photo-bombing’ – when someone spoils a photo by sneaking into the . frame, usually to poke fun at somebody. Mr Salmond insisted he had not planned to target Mr Cameron, adding: 'I had no idea what the seating arrangements were - that is absolutely the case.' But Education Secretary Michael Gove suggested it was inappropriate behaviour for Wimbledon's Royal Box. He told LBC 97.3: 'I think there is a difference between how you might behave in the Royal Box in Wimbledon and how you might behave in Hampden if a Scottish football team were to win. 'I think it was a wee bit of a stunt... my advice to Alex would just be ""Put it away dear"".' 'Bit sad': Alex Salmond's flag-waving antics attracted some criticism on Twitter from fellow politicians including the former deputy prime minister John Prescott . Murray poses with the Union Flag during the medal ceremony for his gold medal at the London 2012 Olympic Games . It is 77 years since a British man - Fred Perry - won a Wimbledon singles title. But it is 117 years since a Sctosman, Harold Mahony, triumphed - giving Alex Salmond the chance to whip out his Saltire. Mahony was born in Edinburgh in 1867 but spent most of his life in Ireland. At his Wimbledon debut in 1890 he crashed out in the first round, reaching the semis in 1891 and 1892. He took time out to train in America before returning to defeat Englishman Wilfred Baddeley in the final, 6–2, 6–8, 5–7, 8–6, 6–3. He went on to win a silver medal in the men's singles at the 1900 Paris Olympics. Former deputy prime minister John Prescott wrote on Twitter: ‘Alex Salmond photo-bombing David Cameron. Bit sad wasn’t it?’ BBC reporter Jon Sopel joked: ‘Alex Salmond waves a Saltire from Royal Box. Is there a referendum coming?’ Journalist Matthew d’Ancona posted: ‘Alex Salmond is usually a consummate politician. 'But today he was a grade-one wally.’ Comedian Brian ‘Limmy’ Limond wrote: ‘I’m pro-independence, but put the flag away Salmond - f****** grow up.’ He added: ‘Imagine Cameron scrambling for the Union Flag. Clumsy.’ Songwriter Roddy Hart asked on Twitter: ‘No matter how genuine or heartfelt, surely Salmond reaching for the Saltire whilst cameras watching would be seen as opportunistic?’ Mark Ferguson, editor of Labour website LabourList wrote: ‘Anyone spot Alex Salmond waving the Saltire behind Cameron’s head? Obvious what he was trying to do. You’ve got no class Salmond, no class.’ Labour peer George Foulkes said there is a ‘time and place’ for such a stunt. But Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon leapt to the defence of her boss. ‘Hey folks, waving the Saltire isn’t political,’ she wrote on her Twitter account. ‘It’s showing enormous pride that a boy from Dunblane just won Wimbledon.’ Mr Salmond later hailed Murray as the . 'King of Scotland' whose victory over Novak Djokavic in straight sets . may be the 'pinnacle of Scottish sporting triumph'. Speaking . on Good Morning Scotland, Mr Salmond said: 'It's right up there, it's . up there with Chris Hoy, or Celtic and the European Cup. 'It's . an amazing victory. Paul Lawrie, Sandy Lyle in the Open. It's probably . the pinnacle. He says it's the pinnacle of tennis, this might be the . pinnacle of Scottish sporting triumph. 'It's an absolutely astonishing triumph.' Mr Salmond also revealed he is planning further celebrations in Scotland to capitalise on Murray's extraordinary victory. When asked what plans there were to . honour the sportsman, Mr Salmond added: 'He's already got the freedom of . Stirling. 'I was thinking of a reception in Stirling Castle, which has . got a nice sort of home town ring to it with Dunblane, something like . that. 'But Andy is king of Scotland, he can have anything he likes.' Criticism: Former deputy prime minister Lord Prescott was one of the first to ridicule Mr Salmond's flag stunt . Gaffe: Broadcaster Iain Dale thought it was funny that the TV cameras did not linger on the Saltire . Twitter user David Birch suggested an Englishman staged a similar stunt . Dark side: Political scientist Philip Cowley posted this joke on Twitter . Greeting: The two men appeared to exchange friendly words as they took their seats in the royal box to watch Murray take on Djokovic . Concentration: Mr Salmond and Mr Cameron watched from the royal box as the two finalists battled it out in sweltering heat on Centre Court . Should Andy Murray be given a knighthood for winning Wimbledon? Mr Salmond’s spokesman earlier defended . the decision to take a large Saltire into Centre Court said: ‘Scotland . feels enormous pride that a young man from Dunblane has won Wimbledon. 'With flags of all kinds flying around . Wimbledon and even a Saltire above Downing St, one extra Saltire among a . sea of flags seems like a fair way to celebrate.’ The All England Club declined to comment on the incident. Murray was criticised after joking . before the 2006 World Cup that he would be supporting anyone other than . England in the competition. He has not indicated which way he . will vote in next year’s referendum on Scottish independence, but he . warned his countrymen not to let their heart rule their head.

A heavily-pregnant woman critically injured in a car crash woke up three days later - to find her baby boy had been born. Wei Liu, 30, and her boyfriend Geng Yu, 24, were on their way home in a taxi when it was struck by a Golf car. Wei, who was eight months pregnant, suffered serious injuries in the car crash in Ancoats, Manchester, and was rushed to hospital in a critical condition. Reunited: Wei Liu woke up three days after being seriously injured in a car crash and met her baby boy Lucas for the very first time. The mother and baby are now both recovering well at home . Meeting for the first time: This picture was taken the moment Wei Liu got to hold baby Lucas for the very first time shortly after waking up in hospital . Together again: Doctors carried out an emergency caesarian on Wei Liu after the car crash - but warned her boyfriend Geng Yu, pictured left, there was a chance neither would survive . Doctors at Manchester Royal Infirmary warned her boyfriend he may have to decide between saving the life of his partner or that of their baby. They performed an emergency caesarean in the A&E room to deliver baby Lucas a month early before operating on Wei and placing her in an induced coma. Wei had suffered a severed artery above her heart, fractured ribs which had pierced her liver and a shattered pelvis, leaving doctors uncertain if she would survive her injuries. But she made a remarkably recovery and woke up three days later to meet her baby boy for the first time. Bonding: Wei Liu, pictured giving baby Lucas a kiss, said she feels incredibly lucky that both her and her baby have survived . Crash scene: Wei Liu and her boyfriend Geng Yu were on their way home in a taxi when it was struck by a Golf car - leaving them both with serious injuries . And after 40 days in hospital Wei, a shop assistant at Selfridges, was allowed home. She said: 'The last thing I remember is the taxi turning across Great Ancoats Street as I was on the phone to a friend. 'The . next thing, I woke up with people all around me. I had something in my . mouth so I couldn’t speak but I realised my belly had gone smaller and . my baby was gone. 'Because I couldn’t talk I kept just touching my belly and heard people saying ""your baby is fine"". 'I found out later the doctors had told my boyfriend to be prepared because they hadn’t seen that many people survive things like this before. Injuries: Wei Liu suffered a severed artery above her heart, fractured ribs which pierced her liver, a fractured cheekbone, broken foot and shattered pelvis, in the smash but, incredibly, both her and her baby survived . 'I think at one point he was asked if he . would rather save me or the baby. My heart had stopped beating for a . few seconds and they thought I was dead. 'A few days later I woke up again and Geng was there in a wheelchair. That was when I got to hold Lucas for the first time. 'I still can’t work out how I survived. I just feel so lucky to be alive and that Lucas is okay.' On the mend: Wei Liu still needs a wheelchair to get around because of the injuries to her pelvis and she is also still suffering from memory loss . Wei also suffered a fractured cheekbone, broken foot and a huge cut across her head, which needed 48 stitches. She is now back at her Ancoats home and is recovering well, but remains in a wheelchair and has memory problems. Geng was also injured in the crash on May 3, needing surgery for a punctured lung, broken ribs and injuries to his feet. He said: 'I didn’t know what to do when they said I might have to choose between Wei and the baby, I was in so much pain. 'I . just didn’t want to go to the operating theatre myself until I heard . the baby had been born - when I heard him cry I started crying too. I am . devastated I missed him being born but so happy he and Wei are alive.' Intensive care registrar Dr Tuheen Huda was part of a team of doctors fighting to save both Wei and her son. Dr Huda said: 'Their survival is entirely testament to the fact that we have had a really good major trauma system set up. 'In . Wei’s case we checked her baby and found its heart rate was dropping, . and found a major blood vessel coming from her heart had been cut in . two. Her and her baby’s lives really were in serious danger. 'But . after surgery, within a few days she was ready to be awakened. Her . mother had come over from China and I took her off the ventilator and . introduced them, then about an hour later we brought her baby in so she . could see him for the first time.

Scientists have grown a tiny liver in experiments hailed as a huge step forward for desperately ill transplant patients . Scientists have grown a tiny liver – in experiments hailed as a huge step forward for desperately ill transplant patients. The technique could one day be used to patch up diseased and damaged organs, removing the agonising – and sometimes unsuccessful – wait for a transplant. The manmade tissue could also be used to test new medicines, preventing disasters such as the ‘Elephant Man’ drug trial, in which six men were left fighting for their lives. New kidneys, lungs and pancreases could be grown using the same technique. The research is still at a very early stage but British experts have described it as a ‘huge step forward’ and as holding out ‘real promise’ for an alternative to organ transplants. More than 7,000 Britons are on the transplant list, including 154 children. The vast majority are waiting for new kidneys but almost 500 are in need of a liver and around 250 are waiting for healthy lungs to become available. The Japanese researchers used the three types of cell that generate the liver in a human embryo to grow a tiny piece of tissue in a dish. It was then grafted on to a mouse’s brain, where it hooked up to the blood supply and grew for at least two months. The manmade tissue had many of the hallmarks of a working human liver, including the ability to break down drugs. In experiments, the manmade tissue also extended the life of rodents with fatal liver disease, the journal Nature reports. The scientists chose the brain because it was easy for them to attach the piece of liver and watch it at work. However, with human patients, the pieces would actually be used to patch up the liver. It is hoped the first tests on people can be done in a decade. Researcher Takanori Takebe, of Yokohama City University, said the first patients are likely to be babies and children with severe liver disease.  But, in time, adults could also benefit. He added that he believes that his recipe for growing patches of liver is more natural than those being perfected by other scientists and holds ‘enormous therapeutic potential’ for transplant patients. Dr Dusko Ilic, a stem cell scientist from King’s College London, said: ‘The strategy is very promising and represents a huge step forward.’ Dr Matthew Smalley, of Cardiff . University, cautioned that the technique won’t be suitable for all . transplant patients, but added: ‘Nevertheless, the study holds out real . promise for a viable alternative approach to human organ transplants.’ The research is still at a very early stage but British experts have described it as a 'huge step forward' and as holding out 'real promise' for an alternative to organ transplants, (pictured). More than 7,000 Britons are on the transplant list, including 154 children. Almost 500 people are in need of a liver . Professor Chris Mason, an expert in regenerative medicine from University College London, said the manmade pieces of tissue may be most useful when testing new medicines. If the patches of liver struggle to break down the chemicals, the treatments could be shelved before they do harm. In 2006, six previously healthy young men were admitted to intensive care after taking part in trials of a new drug at Northwick Park hospital in north London. One man’s head swelled up so much that his fiancée to likened him to the Elephant Man. Another spent five months in hospital with heart, liver and kidney failure.  He lost some fingers and all his toes were amputated. In other cases, drugs have been withdrawn after they have hit the market. James Neuberger, of NHS Blood and Transplant, which runs the organ donor register, said: ‘The work currently being carried out in the field of regenerative medicine to “engineer” organs for transplant is very exciting. ‘With further development, it could one day help to tackle the acute shortage of organs available for transplant here in the UK. 'However, it is likely to be many years before these scientific advances translate into a form of widespread, readily-available treatment for patients. ‘In the meantime, if we are to reduce the number of people who die every year due to the lack of available organs, we need more people to discuss organ donation with their families and join the NHS organ donor register.’","Scientists have grown a tiny liver that could be used to test new medicines .

They found activities which promote mental stimulation such as reading books and doing crosswords at any age could be linked to a slower rate of decline in brain power. It is the latest evidence that people who exercise their grey cells are protected against mental decline. Dr Robert Wilson said: ‘Our study suggests that exercising your brain by taking part in activities such as these across a person’s lifetime, from childhood through old age, is important for brain health in old age.’ Keeping the mind alive: A new study has found that people who stimulate their brain by frequently reading had a slower rate of decline in brain power (stock image) Doctors have long held that keeping your brain active – especially in later years – could be the best insurance against developing Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia. In Britain, around 820,000 people have dementia, with most suffering from Alzheimer’s. Previous research has found regular exercise can cut the risk of developing dementia, while other studies suggest keeping the brain active by doing crosswords, playing cards and computer work. The study involved 294 people over the age of 55 who were given cognitive tests every six years until their deaths at an average age of 89. They also answered a questionnaire about whether they read books, wrote or participated in other activities linked to memory stimulation during childhood, adolescence, middle age and at their current age. Exercising the mind: Other activities which promote mental stimulation, such as crossword puzzles, also help slow the decline of brain power . After they died, their brains were examined for evidence of physical signs of dementia, such as lesions. The study found people who did mentally stimulating activities both early and late in life had a slower rate of decline in memory compared to those who did not do any such activities across their lifetime. The study found that even adjusting for factors such as dementia, those who had a record of participating in such activities had a rate of cognitive decline estimated at 15 per cent slower than those who did not. Dr Wilson, from Rush University Medical Centre in Chicago, said: ‘Based on this, we shouldn’t underestimate the effects of everyday activities, such as reading and writing, on our children, ourselves and our parents or grandparents.’ The study found the rate of decline was reduced by 32 per cent in people with frequent mental activity in later life, compared to people with average mental activity. The rate of decline of those with infrequent activity was 48 per cent faster than those with average activity, says a report in the medical journal Neurology. Dr Simon Ridley, head of research at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: ‘There is increasing evidence suggesting that mental activity may help protect against cognitive decline, but the underlying reasons for this remain unclear. ‘By examining donated brain tissue this study has shed more light on this complex question, and the results lend weight to the theory that mental activity may provide a level of ‘‘cognitive reserve’’, helping the brain resist some of the damage from diseases such as Alzheimer’s.’ Dr James Pickett, head of research at the Alzheimer’s Society, said: ‘This study finds that demanding mental activity can help protect your memory later in life, but it’s important to note this isn’t the same as protecting against dementia. More research is needed.’","Reading or doing crosswords at any age could .

A scandal-hit GP told a patient displaying signs of bowel cancer that he should just eat some mangoes, a hearing has heard. The patient was really an undercover reporter investigating Dr Inayat Inayatullah, who had been allowed back to work despite failing to spot the symptoms of a cancer patient who later died. The reporter was working on a Dispatches documentary aired by Channel 4 which aimed to expose wrongdoing by doctors who had previously been disciplined. Inayatullah is now facing a fitness to practice hearing at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester, where he is accused of failing in his duty to two undercover 'patients', as well as writing a prescription while suspended. The Dispatches programme, broadcast in 2011, appeared to show the doctor telling a journalist who was presenting standard symptoms of bowel cancer, 'Get yourself some mangoes.' The reporter, referred to as 'AC', visited  Inayatullah at his East London surgery complaining of stomach pain, constipation and passing blood. The doctor spent much of the consultation talking on the phone before sending the patient away with laxatives. When he returned for a second consultation a month later with the same symptoms, he was simply given stronger constipation medication. 'This man's complaint was constipation,' Inayatullah told the tribunal yesterday. 'When asked him to sit down, how I can help, he directly said to me constipation. 'He put emphasis from the start to the end that he had constipation. If he didn't say it was constipation, I would look at it.' In 2006, the GP was put under strict conditions after it emerged that he told a young mother suffering from cancer that she just had swollen glands. Linda Geden went to see Inayatullah in 2002 with a lump on her neck, but he only gave her paracetamol and later accused her of wasting his time when she returned. She died four years later aged 38, and before her death she made a statement saying her illness 'would not have got to its stage or spread if Dr Inayatullah had done his job properly'. However, he was allowed to return to work unrestricted in 2009 after a panel found his fitness to practise was not impaired. Death: Linda Geden succumbed to cancer aged 38 after Inayatullah told her she only had swollen glands . He was suspended again after the Dispatches programme was broadcast two years later. Another undercover reporter, known as 'JB', told the doctor he had a 'funny feeling in his arm' which his wife was worried about. Inayatullah failed to take a proper medical history, examine the patient fully or provide a diagnosis on the basis of his symptoms, according to the General Medical Council. He is also accused of falsifying his notes on AC, as well as writing a prescription for a third patient while he was forbidden from doing so. The GP claims he gave the two fake 'patients' adequate consultations, and insists the prescription charge is the result of a 'conspiracy' involving the chemist who reported him to the GMC. 'Why is she ringing you and blaming me? I never did it, I never would do it,' he told the hearing. 'Why didn't she ring the police and say, ""I've got a patient here?"" 'This is somebody who has done it being very clever, trying to harm me by conspiring against me. This is a conspiracy of a high degree.' The hearing continues.","Inayat Inayatullah suspended after failing to spot Linda Geden's cancer .

It shows the officers gyrating against a police van, cycling in circles, and even donning a road cone as they dance to the beat. A Met spokesman said it first became aware of the video in February, when the Professional standards unit launched an investigation.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'The Metropolitan Police Service does not condone unprofessionalism in the workplace. 'We expect high standards from all our staff. 'Appropriate misconduct procedures have been taken regarding those involved.' The Harlem Shake song was originally released in May 2012, but the online phenomenon was born on January 30th, when one video blogger posted a video of himself and three others dressed in colourful latex suits dancing to the song. Created by Harry Rodrigues, aka DJ Baauer, video tributes to the song have collectively generated 175million views to date. Unlike 2012's Gangnam Style internet dance craze, the Harlem Shake does not involve any specific dance moves and is instead more of a free-for-all, often leading to hilarious results. In one video, a troop of Norwegian soldiers is seen lining up in formation. But it seems the amusing video, which was shared on YouTube, has failed to raise a laugh from Scotland Yard bosses, who launched an investigation into the 'misconduct' Six of the PCSOs were given written warnings, and one has now resigned, prior to a gross misconduct board relating to the video as well as other matters . One of the soldiers begins dancing, and 20 seconds into the video the other soldiers - who are suddenly wearing skis, standing on their heads or wrapped up in sleeping bags on the ground - join in on the dance. Another video sees the crew and animals of San Antonio Sea World, all bopping their heads and shaking their fins to the beat of the tune. But Scotland Yard is not the only organisation to fail to see the funny side. An Oxford University librarian lost her job after students filmed themselves doing the latest dance craze on her watch. Calypso Nash, 23, was dismissed from St Hilda’s College after a video that shows students noisily performing a ‘Harlem Shake’ in the college library appeared on YouTube.","Metropolitan traffic officers filmed performing dance craze at end of a shift .

Emergency services are urging Britons to take care in the scorching hot weather after receiving more 999 calls yesterday than on New Year's Eve. West Midlands Ambulance Service received 3,211 . emergency calls yesterday, almost 400 more 999 calls than on New . Year's Eve in 2012. Emergency service staff say misdemeanours in the hot sun are to blame for the . excess of calls and have warned against the . dangers of sunstroke and burns, BBQ accidents, dehydration and swimming . related dangers, as the UK enjoys a heatwave. It comes after a boy lost his life swimming in  a lake at an old quarry to try and cool off in the scorching 30C heat yesterday. Hidden dangers: A boy has died after going for a swim in Gullet Quarry, near Upper Colwall, Herefordshire, to cool off in the blazing heat yesterday . The boy, who has not been named, was pulled from Gullet Quarry, near Upper Colwall, Herefordshire, nearly four . hours after he had failed to resurface at around 1pm. Emergency services including specialist diving teams rushed to the scene after reports the boy had disappeared. Paramedics . along with a Hazardous Area Response Team (HART), an air ambulance, . Hereford and Worcester Fire Service and a diving team from South Wales . Police, joined the hunt for the boy. He was eventually located at around 4.50pm following the 'comprehensive' search. Medics attempted to resuscitate him, but despite their efforts the boy died. Today a young man was hospitalised after tombstoning off a pier at a packed beach. The man dived into shallow water off the beach at Boscombe, Bournemouth and struck his head on the bottom, suffering head and back injuries. He had to be airlifted from the scene and was taken to Poole Hospital, where he is believed to be in a stable condition. Ignoring the warnings: There were more swimmers out in the Quarry lake today despite someone having died less than 24 hours before . Warning signs: There are numerous signs around the quarry warning of the dangers of swimming in the water which still contains old equipment . Following the death of the boy yesterday, police have issued a warning against swimming in the dangerous bodies of water. However, they are not treating the incident as suspicious. A woman who lives locally, but did not want to be named, said this was not the first death a the quarry. She said: 'My partner called me and said it was all cordoned off because a lad had died. 'There are signs up all around saying don't swim or dive, and that people have been killed in the last few years here. 'Under the water there's the old machinery still down there. 'But kids still thrown themselves off the cliffs into the water, and that water is freezing cold.' Another . resident, Bill Frankly, 68, said: 'That quarry must be 100ft deep in . the middle. When they left they left a crane in there and I think it's . still stood upright in the water hidden from view. 'In . the past a lad who jumped off the cliff hit the side and broke his back . as he went down. It's dangerous to try and swim or dive.'

The last portrait made of Admiral Lord Nelson before he was killed in the Battle of Trafalgar is expected to fetch £30,000 at auction tomorrow. Nelson was painted by John Whichelo in September 1805 after the young artist visited him at his estate in Merton, South London. While at his home, Nelson began plans for the Battle of Trafalgar and also said his goodbyes to lover Lady Emma Hamilton. He was killed in action a month later as he led the Royal Navy to victory against the French and Spanish. But just a month later, he was killed in action has he led the British navy to their famous win over Napoleon's forces. The profile portrait depicts a grey-haired Nelson in Vice-Admiral's undress uniform with the Star of the Order of the Bath pinned to his chest. The order was presented to Nelson following the British victory at Cape St Vincent in 1797, and it was pinned to his uniform when he was shot dead at Trafalgar.

Dr Gabriel Heaton, from auctioneers Sotheby's, said: 'This is a wonderful and poignant portrait of one of Britain's unambiguous heroes.

Policing minister Damian Green said officers should be more police and friendly to repair their reputation . Police officers should be more polite and friendly to repair their reputation following the Stephen Lawrence smears controversy, policing minister Damian Green said yesterday. Mr Green said public faith in British policing had been ‘undermined’ by revelations that the police had spied on the Lawrence family after their son was murdered in 1993. In a speech to the Reform think tank, he said officers should learn from the experience of last year’s London Olympics. He said: ‘The public reaction to the . friendliness and openness of police at the Olympic Games shows how . important relationship-building can be. ‘A . more open, polite, thoughtful, modern and representative police force . can renew its relationship with the British public for the benefit of us . all. ‘The Team GB example shows very clearly that it does not matter how good you are – you can always get better.’ The . revelation that an undercover officer was told to find information to . smear the Lawrence family after their son’s murder is the latest in a . series of scandals surrounding the ethics of undercover officers. Their practices have been mired in . controversy since allegations emerged that they had been using dead . children’s identities and engaging in inappropriate sexual . relationships. An investigation into undercover policing by the Metropolitan Police, named Operation Herne, is currently under way. And there are at least another seven investigations going on as a result of police failings, which have so far cost £23million. The minister said public faith in British policing has been 'undermined' by revelations officers spied on the family of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence (pictured) after his death in 1993 . Mr Green said yesterday: ‘I want and expect to see a technologically savvy, well-managed, self-confident, open, transparent and scrupulously honest police force. ‘The police have always made us proud. I want them to do so again.’ But Labour last night said Mr Green’s comments were ‘deeply patronising’. Shadow policing minister David Hanson told the Daily Telegraph: ‘I am sure a police officer tackling a pub brawl on a Saturday night in the town centre will take the advice of their policing minister to heart. ‘Of course the police should be polite . with the public but many will see Damian Green comments as deeply . patronising as they have been doing it throughout their careers. Sir Peter Fahy, chief constable of Greater Manchester, said officer morale is low after negative publicity . ‘The police should always act appropriately and face the consequences if they don’t - should they be polite of course they should and they don’t need Damian Green to tell them that.’ Mr Green’s comments come after one of the country’s most senior police chiefs claimed morale among officers is being affected by a barage of negative publicity. Sir Peter Fahy, chief constable of Greater Manchester Police, said: ‘They are affected by what feels like a constant stream of negative stories at the moment... the impact of all the negative publicity does affect the whole force.’ Sir Peter, who is also vice president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, added: ‘There are a lot of judgements by armchair generals and almost professors in hindsight, not taking into context the state of society and things officers were being asked to do at the time some of these events occurred.’","Minister for Policing and Criminal Justice Damian Green said faith in officers has been 'undermined' by revelations police spied on teenager's family .

Accuser: Jeremy Paxman says TV bosses treat viewers like they are 'idiots' University Challenge presenter Jeremy Paxman has defended today’s students saying it is ‘complete rubbish’ to suggest they are apathetic and ignorant. He said questions on his long-running BBC2 quiz are tougher than ever, adding he was still shocked at how much current contestants knew. Mr Paxman, 63, said that TV bosses should ‘stop insulting the public’s intelligence’ by ‘assuming we’re all idiots’ and said the reason why the  show has endured in popularity is down to the fact that it has refused to dumb down. He said: ‘We haven’t compromised. It’s quite hard and it will stay quite hard. In an age when you can win shedloads of money or fleeting glory by knowing the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s first name (even though that one did seem to stump President Obama),’ Elaborating on his passion for University Challenge which he has presented for almost 20 years, he told the Radio Times: ‘The main reason I love University Challenge is that it gives the lie to the media stereotype about young people – that they all know nothing, and couldn’t care less. ‘It’s complete rubbish. Every year we see more and more teams of young people who know amazing things, and you’re just left wondering in pleasurable disbelief, “How on earth did they get that?”’ He added: ‘Television bosses should stop insulting the public’s intelligence by assuming we’re all idiots.’ Mr Paxman said his quiz had the ‘courtesy’ of treating the audience as though it were ‘clever enough to take part.’ Earlier this year on the show, Mr Paxman was branded ‘rude’ and ‘nasty’ by some viewers for the way he dealt with a nervous contestant. The corporation was hit with 44 complaints after the show was broadcast. There has, in recent years, been a rivalry between University Challenge and Mastermind, presented by John Humphrys, about which programme asks the harder questions. He said: ¿The main reason I love University Challenge is that it gives the lie to the media stereotype about young people ¿ that they all know nothing, and couldn¿t care less' When Mr Humphrys interviewed Mr Paxman on the Today programme last year, to discuss the 50th anniversary of University Challenge, there was a discussion about whether students were getting ‘brighter’ or ‘dumber’ on the evidence of the show. Paxman, famous for his own tough interviewing style, refused to divulge how he fared against the students on his BBC2 show, saying: 'That one I’m not going to answer.' He added that his favourite round on the show was one in which students got every single question wrong - when they were asked to identify laundry instruction symbols on clothes labels. He also claimed he had now asked 64,000 questions on the show, which airs on Monday nights on BBC 2.","Broadcaster blasts bosses for rubbishing intelligence of young people .

Fresh from roaring Andy Murray to Britain’s first men’s Wimbledon title since 1936 on Sunday, the Prime Minister yesterday pulled out all the stops  to welcome him to Downing Street. The Prime Minister could barely contain his glee as the newly crowned champion arrived for a reception. Scroll down for video .

And, no doubt hoping some of Murray’s winning star dust might rub off on the Coalition, No 10 staff had a photo of the PM and Murray out on Twitter within seconds of their meeting. Mr Cameron confirmed that the Wimbledon champion would be recommended for a knighthood, with Murray saying it  would be a ‘nice thing to have’. The Prime Minister said he would put the ‘suggestion’ to the Honours Committee, adding: ‘I can’t think of anyone who deserves one more.’ Mr Cameron said Murray had ‘lifted the spirits of the whole country’ with his nerve-racking win over world No 1 Novak Djokovic. He added: ‘It was a fantastic day for Andy Murray, for British tennis and for Britain. We were wondering yesterday morning, “Do we dare to dream that this is possible?” and he proved absolutely that it was. ‘Honours are decided independently but, frankly, I can’t think of anyone who deserves one more.’ Murray said he was not sure that he had earned the honour but indicated he would happily accept it. Asked if he would accept the gong, he said: ‘I wouldn’t turn it down.’ The 26-year-old added: ‘I think it’s a nice thing to have or be offered. ‘I think just because everyone’s waited for such a long time for this, that’s probably why it’ll be suggested, but I don’t know if it merits that. I don’t know.’ Murray was awarded an OBE in the New Year’s honours list for services to tennis after he won Olympic gold and triumphed at the US Open last October.

It is usual for public figures to wait for four years before being given a higher honour. But senior government sources said that was ‘not a hard and fast rule’ and the convention will be ignored because of the magnitude of the moment. The suggestion that the Government will recommend the gong sparked a debate about whether someone who was paid £1.6million for his win and is still only 26 should get one of the highest honours. Ministers appear to be following the example of Sir Bradley Wiggins who was honoured for winning the Tour de France.

A little over 10 years ago Michael Carroll was sitting on a £10million fortune after scooping the lottery. But now the money has gone and he has been forced to take a job in a biscuit factory for just £204 a week. His ignominious journey from rags to riches and back again has included squandering money on fast cars, huge quantities and drugs and drink and has even included two spells in prison. Divorced from his wife, Sandra, the man dubbed the ‘lotto lout’ has now had to move north to Scotland to be near his 10-year-old daughter, Brooke. And at one stage he was so broke he was forced to sleep rough in a forest while looking for work. But despite the wasted money, the stints behind bars and the broken marriage, Carroll, 30, - who styled himself as the King of Chavs - says he is happier now. He said: ‘I moved to Scotland to be closer to Brooke and to get out of my drinking - friends said the drink and drugs would have killed me within six months and I’ve been clean of drugs for over two years. ‘I’d had 10 years of doing what a rock star does and I had to sort myself out so I decided to head up to Scotland and it’s great – I love it up here. ‘In Norfolk I crashed on a mate’s sofa but I’ve got a two-bedroom council flat just outside Elgin so I’m well sorted.’ Carroll won £9.7million on the National Lottery in 2002 and immediately set about spending it. He gave £4m to friends and family, bought a mansion in Swaffham, Norfolk, and splashed out on racing cars. He admits wasting millions on cocaine, drink, gambling and prostitutes, all washed down with two bottles of vodka a day. He was handed an ASBO for terrorising his neighbours and he was jailed for five months in 2004 after failing to comply with a drug treatment order imposed as part of a sentence for cocaine possession and in February 2006 he was jailed for nine months for affray. By February 2010, he was declared bankrupt and was back on Jobseeker’s Allowance after admitted blowing the fortune. Today Carroll has swapped high rock star . lifestyle for a hairnet and white overalls to turn out tartan tins of . shortbread at the Walkers factory in Elgin, Morayshire. Lifestyle change: Carroll now lives in Scotland and works packing and stacking shortbread . Write caption here . Tattooed Carroll, who has shed five stone after taking part in a TV fitness documentary, said: ‘I get £204 every week for packing and stacking shortbread and cookies and I love it. I treasure those wages more than any £9million fortune. ‘I’ve got all I need so this is a new start for me. When I first moved up I was in a tent for a week in the woods because I had nowhere to go and hadn’t started at the factory. ‘Sitting there in the woods was when I first thought I could sort myself out properly.’ Two months ago he got a job as a packer with Walkers and now works a six-hour shift, five days a week with more than 200 colleagues on the production line, boxing up biscuits and shortbread. The products are then shipped off around the world. Big winner: Mr Carroll styled himself as the King of Chavs and splashed his millions on cocaine, cars, prostitutes and two bottles of vodka a day . Money roller: After giving away a part of his millions to friends, he also bought a bought a mansion in Swaffham, Norfolk, and splashed out on racing cars . Carroll said: ‘I’m so happy to get a wage-packet again. I’m definitely happier because I’m back to reality. A few people recognised me when I started but everyone’s been brilliant. I had lots of questions about the money in the first few days and where it all went. ‘I said I was a 19-year-old d***head who went nuts – what teenager wouldn’t? But now I’m 30 it’s time to grow up. I love the work – I couldn’t sit here on benefits. He says he cycles almost everywhere after being banned for drink-driving and enjoys nothing better than playing games on his X-Box in the evening. He said: ‘I used to arrange banger-racing in the field behind my mansion but these days I just play Grand Theft Auto and Grid 2 on my X-Box. Carroll said he still plays the lottery but says he would spend the mney on helping others if he won again. He said: ‘The only thing I’ve won recently is my life back. But if I won £9million again I’d help kids on drugs – then emigrate to Australia, buy some properties, rent them out and sit back and wait on the money to come in. Don’t get me wrong, though – I’d still have a few parties.’","Michael Carroll was dubbed the 'lotto lout' after blowing his £10m win .

Young mother: Janine Mallett was discovered on Saturday morning by the main beach of San Antonio, Ibiza . A young mother apparently drowned after going for a midnight swim during an evening out on the holiday island of Ibiza. Janine Mallett, 31, was found in the sea early on Saturday after becoming separated from her friend while celebrating in the party resort of San Antonio. She was pronounced dead and police immediately launched an investigation. But last night they were understood to have ruled out ‘foul play’ and believe she may have died in a tragic accident. Spanish police are investigating whether Mrs Mallett may have decided to go for a midnight swim in the sea after spending the evening in bars in the resort. Tests are also being carried out to see whether she suffered a heart attack and drowned. Mrs Mallett lived in Stockton-on-Tees with her husband, Iain, an electrician, and her two children, a boy, aged three, and a girl, aged six. Last night Mr Mallett, 30, was being comforted by friends and family and was too upset to speak at their home in the town. But her mother, Colleen Hadfield, 62, said: ‘She was the most lovely person. She was beautiful. We are just waiting to see when we can bring her home.’ Her brother, Adam, 27, and sister, Gemma, 29, are said to be beside themselves with grief over the tragedy. Neighbour Pauline Kelsey, 61, who lives two doors down said: ‘I have known Iain and his family since he was a kid. Janine has got two children - a boy and a girl. Tragic discovery: Mrs Mallett's body was found at S'Arenal beach, where Spanish police are investigating whether she may have decided to go for a midnight swim . ‘They are beautiful. She would do anything for anyone. She is beautiful, she has always been really nice. There is nothing you can say, is there. It is total devastation.’ She said: ‘They are a young family - I can’t believe it. She would help anybody, she was that kind of young lady. She was always very smart.’ Her husband Bob Kelsey, 63, a professional driver, said: ‘You couldn’t ask for better neighbours. We are totally shocked. She is only a young girl. You don’t expect things like this.’ An autopsy was due to be carried out on her body last night to determine the cause of death. A female friend of married Janine, who had flown to Ibiza with her on Thursday, has told police she lost sight of her during the night while they were out partying. Party town: San Antonio where the two friends were on holiday is the clubbing capital of Ibiza . Her body was discovered on Saturday morning just before 11am off S’Arenal beach, the main beach of party resort San Antonio. A source said: ‘Janine was with a female friend. They went out and got separated from each other and the friend went back to the hotel alone just before 1am on Saturday morning with no idea where Janine was. ‘They hadn’t spoken about going swimming as far as I know so it’s a mystery as to how Janine’s body came to be in the sea. The friend is obviously devastated.’ A spokesman for the Foreign Office said ‘We can confirm the death of a British national in Ibiza .We are offering consular assistance to the family.’","Janine Mallett and her friend lost each other on Friday while out partying .

Police are questioning a man about the brutal rape and murder of a 28-year-old mother, who was snatched from outside a Texas beach house six years ago, while her two-year-old child slept inside. Bridgette Gearen had been spending the weekend with her daughter, Kyra, and friends at Crystal Beach when she was snatched by four men just before midnight, and raped, beaten and strangled. Six years later Galveston County police are questioning a man they arrested on a separate charge in relation to the violent attack on the legal assistant from Beaumont. Victim: Bridgette Gearen, who was raped and strangled on a beach, with her daughter Krya . Crime scene: Bridgette was staying with friends at Crystal Beach when she was snatched by four men in a SUV . Her body was found dumped at the water's edge the following morning. She had tried desperately to fight off her violent attackers in a case a police chief says is the worst he has seen in his 40-year career. The suspect, who has not yet been named, is in his 20s and from the area, police said. Since the attack they have been trying to trace four men who they believe grabbed Miss Gearen in the short moment she was alone outside. 'This person isn’t going anywhere for a long, long, long time,' Lieutenant Tommy Hansen, who says he will not retire until the killers are brought to justice, told KHou news. He believes the suspect may be able to identify the other men involved, and warned the murderers: 'We're coming.' Earlier in the case, Lieutenant Hansen, said: 'We feel very comfortable it was . multiple suspects, primarily from out of state, who may have possibly . hooked up with a local person from [the Crystal Beach] area.' For Miss Gearen's daughter, Kyra, who had been with her that night, the pain of losing her mother is still fresh. Grief: Kyra, who was 2 when her mother was murdered, says losing her has left a big hole in her heart . Vacation: Bridgette Gearen was taken after stepping outside of a beach house moments before her friends . 'It’s like a big hole straight in the . middle of your heart,' Kyra Portie, 8, said. 'She was young and nobody . deserves to be killed like that.' Kyra had been staying at the Bolivar Peninsula beach house with her mother and friends on the night Miss Gearen was taken. The legal assistant went outside at about midnight, as the group of friends decided to take a midnight drive along the coast in July 2007. Her friends said they heard the gate close behind her, but moments later there was no trace of her. Witnesses saw her getting into a dark colored SUV with four men, though they were not sure if she was being threatened. Brutal: Lieutenant Tommy Hansen says the case is one of the most violent he has ever seen . Devoted: Bridgette Gearen with her young daughter, who was with her the night she was killed . A short time later teenagers who were on the beach heard her screams. 'Twenty-five minutes later that same vehicle went back by going eastbound at a very high rate of speed,' Lieutenant Hansen said. 'I'm going to rank it as one of the most violent things I've seen,' he added. An autopsy on the 28-year-old's body showed she had been the victim of a violent sexual assault. She had had been beaten about the face with a blunt object and strangled in an attack that may have lasted for two hours, according to the Houston Chronicle. Her body was found by walkers the next morning, naked except for her red top. '[Her] clothes were ripped. Her body was half in the water. She was bruised pretty badly,' Kyra's father, Brandon Portie, said. 'It’s tough. They definitely need to be hurt; punished for what they did.' Missed: Kyra with her father Brandon Portie, who wants Bridgette's killers brought to justice . Residents and vacationers at Crystal Beach were so shocked by the violent attack, and lack of arrest, that many say they no longer feel safe walking alone on the beach. 'This haunts us every day. We mourn every day,' Miss Gearen's mother, Pamela Kimball said at a press conference last year. 'Do you know what her little girl thinks about her mom being taken away?' At the same event, Krya pleaded with her mother's killers to come forward. Reading from a statement she had written on pink paper, the little girl said: 'I love my mommy so much and it makes me sad that I could only see her the first two years of my life.'","Man in his 20s questioned over Crystal Beach killing .

Suspended: Tom Watson's office manager Karie Murphy had been set to stand for Labour . The woman at the centre of Labour’s vote-rigging scandal has denied committing identity fraud to ensure she would stand in the next general election. Trade union Unite is accused of signing up people to the Labour Party in Falkirk to guarantee that its preferred candidate, Karie Murphy, would stand for the constituency in 2015. The flame-haired mother-of-two has been suspended along with Stephen Deans, chairman of the Falkirk constituency party, while the allegations are investigated. The controversy led Labour MP Tom Watson to resign this week from his role as the head of the party’s election campaign. However, last night Miss Murphy, 49, who had been Mr Watson’s office manager, strongly denied allegations of corruption, stressing: ‘I haven’t done anything.’ When asked if she had signed voters up to the Falkirk Labour Party without their consent, she replied: ‘No, absolutely not true.’ She added: ‘I don’t know what the allegations are. Until I know what the allegations are it would be inappropriate to try and defend myself. ‘I’ll follow the discipline of the union. I’ll comply with what the party needs from me. That’s as much as I can say.’ It is alleged that Miss Murphy and Mr Deans made local voters members of the constituency party and paid their membership fees, all without their consent. A Labour source said at least seven people in Falkirk were ‘shocked’ to discover they were listed as members, giving them the right to vote on who would be the town’s candidate in the general election. Suspicions were raised when the union allegedly sent a single cheque to cover the membership fees for several new members, rather than leaving the individuals to set up a direct debit. Around 120 new members had signed up within a matter of months. Ed Miliband owes his election as Labour leader in part to Unite and its network of supporters – and he remains dependent on its financial muscle. In July 2010, Unite’s political committee voted to endorse Mr Miliband for the leadership and in August the union’s then joint leaders Derek Simpson and Tony Woodley urged Unite members eligible to vote in the leadership election to back him. Behind the scenes the then Unite political director Charlie Whelan, a former spin doctor for Gordon Brown, worked closely with Tom Watson, who resigned this week, to persuade MPs to back him. Unite broke the spirit of the  election rules by including a leaflet pledging its support for Mr Miliband along with the ballot papers sent to its 950,000 members eligible to vote. Mr Miliband won 47,439 votes from Unite members, more than double any other candidate. In total, he won 60 per cent of trade union votes. Since his election, Unite has given the party more than £8.4 million. Since ‘Red’ Len McCluskey (pictured above) took charge of Unite, the union has published a Political Strategy to ‘win a Labour Government which will govern . . . towards a Socialism for the 21st Century’. It has also run a grassroots campaign to ‘grow Unite membership in local Labour parties’. Labour has announced the end of its scheme that allowed unions to pay new members’ subscriptions for one year, admitting it was ‘open to abuse’. Miss Murphy, who had been the front-runner for the candidacy, is now banned from standing in the 2015 election until an inquiry is held. She will not appear on the constituency’s all-women shortlist.Last night she insisted she would ‘comply fully’ with the investigation. The daughter of an electrician, Miss Murphy worked as a nurse in her native Glasgow, and later became a branch secretary for Unison. She left in 2006 after a decade at the helm of the community health branch, accusing the union of ‘bullying and harassment’. She then then became a trade union representative for petrochemicals firm INEOS. She married television engineer William Cullen in 1991. The couple  had two children – Ryan, 17 and Roisin, 16 – but are now understood to be living apart. Mr Cullen was previously married to MSP Margaret McCulloch, a member of the Scottish Labour Party. Both declined to comment yesterday. In January, Miss Murphy posted a photograph of Margaret Thatcher on her Facebook page, with the words: ‘Having a party when she dies.’ The Facebook account was deactivated when she was challenged about the remarks, made just three months before the former Prime Minister passed away. Miss Murphy is understood to split her time between a flat in Glasgow’s city centre, a home in Falkirk, and London. She is said to be close to Unite boss Len McCluskey, a former flatmate of Mr Watson. Mr McCluskey says the claims of corruption in Falkirk are part of a ‘behind-the-scenes smear campaign’. However, Shadow Defence Secretary Jim Murphy said Unite has ‘well and truly overstepped the mark’ for candidate selection. By GERRI PEEV . Is this right? Labour leader Ed Miliband has been offering free memberships to union members . Ed Miliband has been trying to lure unionists to sign up for free Labour Party memberships.He was caught on video offering a years’s free membership to his party to union members who agree to take out a direct debit. Yesterday the Mail revealed how  anyone who wants to stand for the Labour Party in any election now has to be a member of a trade union. This criteria was beefed up by Mr Miliband in the Labour rule book in 2011. The wording was changed from saying that anyone who wanted to stand for office as a Labour candidate ‘should’ be a union member to ‘shall’ be a union member ‘affiliated to the TUC’. Aspiring candidates must also contribute to the union’s political fund. The rule book says: ‘As well as demanding that anyone who wants to be a candidate must ‘have continuous membership of the party for at least 12 months’, he or she must ‘also be a member of a trade union affiliated to the TUC or considered by the National Executive Committee (NEC) as a bona fide trade union and contribute to the political fund of that union’. Labour insists that this change was ‘grammatical’ or ‘technical adjustment’ and merely confirmed what had been an ‘assumption’ for 15 years. But yesterday the Tories also seized the fact Mr Miliband has appeared in a video advertisement on shopworkers’ union USDAW’s website, where one year’s free Labour Party membership is offered to members who sign up with a direct debit. Visitors to the site are told that they can ‘put your point of view at meetings and policy forums that help decide Labour’s policies’. Diktat: Labour Party rulebook showing how officials changed wording to harden up trade union requirement . Crucially, members are also encouraged to sign up to Labour so they can ‘vote in the selection of all your Labour candidates (after six month’s membership) or stand as a Labour candidate yourself (after one year’s membership)’. In the advert, Mr Miliband then urges . trade unionists to ‘please join us in this mission’ to make society . ‘fairer, more just and equal’. Grant Shapps, the Conservative Party . chairman, said: ‘Ed Miliband claims he was in the dark about Len . McCluskey’s takeover of the Labour Party, and the secret block-buying of . Labour memberships. But there is literally a video of Ed Miliband on a . trade union website, which advertises these kinds of mass schemes. He’s . been caught red-handed. ‘Ed .

Unite’s . political strategy document boasted that it wanted to secure 41 seats . for candidates that shared its left-wing values. So far, eight of those . have been selected with many more contests still to run. But a spokesman for Mr Miliband said that Labour made no secret of wanting ‘ordinary working men and women to join the Party’. He added that the scheme to sign up trade union members – Union Join – had been devised under Tony Blair. ‘That scheme was stopped when we realised it was being abused,’ he said, adding it was ‘very different to being unwittingly signed up as a member of the party without your knowledge’. The spokesman also played down the tightening up of language decreeing that Labour candidates ‘shall’ be trade union officials, saying it was a ‘technical’ adjustment.","Karie Murphy has been suspended amid claims she committed identity fraud .

The news came after Pope Francis approved a second miracle attributed to the Polish pontif who led the Roman Catholic Church from 1978 to 2005. The Vatican said Pope John XXIII, who reigned from 1958 to 1963 and called the Second Vatican Council, would also be made a saint. No dates for the canonisation ceremonies were immediately given. Scroll down for video . Sainthood imminent: Pope John Paul II, seen here releasing doves from the window of his apartments in Vatican City in 2005, will be a saint soon . Controversial: Some of the Vatican's problems, including sex abuse cover-ups and financial scandals, date from the time of Pope John Paul II, leading to questions about his fitness for a sainthood . During John Paul's 2005 funeral Mass, chants of 'Santo Subito!' or 'Sainthood Now!' erupted in St. Peter's Square. Heeding the calls, then-Pope Benedict . XVI waived the typical five-year waiting period and allowed an . investigation into John Paul's life to begin immediately.

Subsequently, the Vatican determined . that a French nun who prayed for his intercession was miraculously cured . of Parkinson's disease. A second miracle is needed for canonization. The Vatican hasn't divulged any details about that second purported miracle. The ANSA news agency reported that a . commission of cardinals and bishops met Tuesday to consider John Paul's . case and signed off on it. A Vatican official confirmed that the . decision had been taken some time back and that Tuesday's meeting was . essentially a formality. One possible canonization date is . December 8, the feast of the Immaculate Conception, a major feast day . for the Catholic Church. This year the feast coincidentally falls on a Sunday, which is when canonizations usually occur. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized by the church to discuss saint-making cases on the record, confirmed reports in La Stampa newspaper that Pope John Paul II could be canonized together with Pope John XXIII, who called the Second Vatican Council but died in 1963 before it was finished. There is reasoned precedent for beatifying or canonizing two popes together, primarily to balance one another out. John Paul II has been on the fast track for possible sainthood ever since his 2005 death, but there remains some concern that the process has been too quick. Some of the Holy See's deep-seated problems - clerical sex abuse, dysfunctional governance and more recently the financial scandals at the Vatican bank - essentially date from shortcomings of his pontificate. All saints: Pope John Paul II and Mother Teresa, who was beatified in 2003, together in Calcutta in 1987 . Defenders of the fast-track process argue that people are canonized, not pontificates. But the Vatican in the past has sought to balance concerns about papal saints by giving two the honor at the same time. Such was the case in 2000, when John Paul beatified John XXIII, dubbed the 'good pope,' alongside Pope Pius IX, who was criticized by Jews for condoning the seizure of a Jewish boy and allegedly referring to Jews as dogs. By canonizing John Paul II along with John XXIII, the Vatican could be seeking to assuage concerns about John Paul's fast-track sainthood case by tying it together with the 50-year wait John XXIII has had to endure.

Passengers who were aboard the doomed Asiana Airways Flight 214 have described the terrifying moment they realized the plane was too low as it prepared to land in San Francisco on Saturday. One passenger, Benjamin Levy, recalled how seconds before landing he looked out from his window and could see the water of the San Francisco Bay about 10 feet below. 'I don't see any runway, I just see water,' Levy told NBC of his panic. 'I realized the [pilot] was a bit too low, too fast, and somehow he was not going to hit the runway on time.' The plane smashed into the runway, severing its tail, exploding into a fireball and skidding to a halt at San Francisco International Airport around 11.40am PCT on Saturday. Horror: Passenger Ben Levy said he noticed the plane was flying very low over the water before the crash . Crash site: The wreckage of Asiana Flight 214 at the San Francisco International Airport on Saturday . Passenger Xu Das had the same realization, posting online after the crash: 'Looking through window, it looked on level of the (sea)wall along the runway.' Fei Xiong was also on board the flight with her eight-year-old son who realised something was not right as they came in to land. She said: 'My son told me ""The plane will fall down, it's too close to the sea"". 'I told him ""No, baby, it's OK, we'll be fine."" And then the plane just fell down.' Levy said the plane hit the runway before it launched into the air, before landing again 'pretty hard'. After the crash, he recalled hearing screams and saw his fellow passengers suffering from broken bones, cuts, burns and bruises, while the man in the seat next to him took a blow to the head. 'It was surreal,' said Levy, who was taken to hospital with minor injuries. 'A lot of people screaming and not really believing what was happening to them. I wasn’t believing it either.' He stood up and opened the door and saw that parts of one of the wings was gone, but he was just thankful to be on the ground. The scene was chaotic but passengers worked together to get out. Horror: A series of images show the plane just moments after it crash landed, killing two schoolgirls . Passengers slid down inflatable emergency chutes as smoke billowed from the wreckage. In the first comments by a crew member, cabin manager Lee Yoon-hye  said that when the captain ordered an evacuation, she knew what she had to do. 'At that point, my head became clear,' she said on Sunday night at a San Francisco news conference. 'I was only thinking about rescuing the next passenger.' Lee said she was calm despite the flames. 'I didn't have a moment to feel that this fire was going to hurt me,' she said. When a teenage boy was afraid to jumping . onto the inflatable slide, Lee said that a flight attendant carried him . on her back and they slid down together. Survivor Fei Xiong has described the moment she realised theAsiana Flight 214 was coming in too low over San Francisco Bay . 'The kid said he was scared. My colleague carried him on her back and jumped. I was inside the plane. (My colleague) was crying as parents tearfully hugged their kid after evacuating safely,' Lee said. She also said passengers were calm during the evacuation. Near the rear of the aircraft in seat 40C, Wen Zhang said she thought the landing gear had failed when she felt the tail slam against the ground. She, too, was with her young son, four. 'I had no time to be scared,' she said. Zhang picked up her child, who had hit the seat in front of him and broke his left leg. Unhurt, she could see a hole that ripped open at the back of the jumbo jet where the bathroom had been and carried her son to safety. 'It left a hole very close to my seat,' she said. 'Enough for two persons to get out'. Sitting near Zhang was 39-year-old Shi Da, who was traveling with his wife and teenage son. He was shocked by the violent shaking of the crash, then the realization that the back of the plane had ripped off. He stood up and could see the tail, but the kitchen was missing with nothing but a hole, he said. 'I can see through the hole to see the runway and the ground,' he said. 'So we just grabbed our bags and rushed out from the tail, from the hole.' Medics found the bodies of two . Chinese schoolgirls on the runway. The airline identified the girls as . students Wang Linjia and Ye Mengyuan, both 16, who were on a class trip. Miraculously, 305 other passenger on the plane survived the crash, with 123 walking away completely physically unscathed. Destruction: Miraculously, more than 300 passengers aboard the plane survived the horrific crash . 'We're lucky there hasn't been a greater loss of life,' San Francisco Fire Chief Joanne Hayes-White said. Witnesses who saw the plane crash said the plane did not look as though it was on the correct path. 'The . plane started coming in at an odd angle, there was a huge bang and you . could see the cloud of huge black smoke,' Kate Belding said. 'It didn't manage to straighten out before hitting the runway,' Stephanie Turner, who was in a nearby hotel, added to ABC News. 'So the tail of the plane hit the runway, and it cartwheeled and spun and the tail broke off...I mean we were sure that we had just seen a lot of people die. It was awful. 'It looked like the plane had completely broken apart. There were flames and smoke just billowing.' While it appears that the plane could have landed too early and clipped the sea wall dividing the airport from the bay, officials have not released an immediate indication of the cause of the accident. National Transportation Safety Board investigators arrived at the airport around midnight on Saturday to begin the inquiry. Probe: Greg Smith of the National Transportation Safety Board looks over the flight data recorder retrieved from the wreckage. An investigation into the cause is now underway . Apology: Asiana Airlines President Yoon Young-doo said he does not believe there was an engine defect . Black boxes from the aircraft, which . record critical data of the flight, have been recovered from the . wreckage and will help investigators understand what brought the craft . crashing down. While . authorities have said very little about the investigation at this early . stage, clues have emerged in witness accounts of the planes approach and . video of the wreckage, leading one aviation expert to say the aircraft . may have approached the runway too low. Mike Barr, a former military pilot and accident investigator who teaches aviation safety at the University of Southern California, said it appeared that something on the plane in its low approach may have caught the runway lip - the seawall at the foot of the runway. Investigators are also looking into what role the shutdown of a key navigational aid may have played in the crash. The glide slope - a ground-based aid that helps pilots stay on course while landing - had been shut down by the airport since June. Asiana Airlines said it did not appear that the crash had been caused by mechanical failure although it declined to blame either the pilot or an error by the control tower.

The minions of 'Despicable Me 2' ran away with the July 4th box office, leaving the Johnny Depp Western 'The Lone Ranger' in the dust.According to studio estimates Sunday, the Universal animated sequel took in $82.5 million over the weekend and $142.1 million across the five-day holiday window. Gore Verbinski's reimagining of the iconic lawman bombed for the Walt Disney Company, opening with just $29.4 million over the weekend, and a disappointing $48.9 million since Wednesday.The trouncing for Disney was especially painful because of the high cost of 'The Lone Ranger', which reportedly cost at least $225 million to make. Made by the same team that created the lucrative Disney franchise 'Pirates of the Caribbean' (the four film series that grossed $3.7 billion worldwide) the Western drew bad reviews and failed to capture the attention of younger moviegoers. Flop: Despite an all-star cast and a huge budget, 'The Lone Ranger' has failed to captivate the movie-going public . Animated: Steve Carell poses with some life-sized minions, the troublemakers from his film 'Despicable Me 2' 'We thought it would appeal to a broader audience than it did,' Dave Hollis, head of distribution for Disney, said. Ranger danger: The big-budget Lone Ranger remake could saddle Disney with a sizable loss in profits . Wild West: Johnny Depp's get-up for his role as Tonto in 'The Lone Ranger' The poor performance of 'The Lone Ranger' called to mind a previous bomb for Disney: last year's similarly-budgeted sci-fi adventure 'John Carter' which opened with $30.1 million.But 'The Lone Ranger,' which stars Armie Hammer as the masked lawman, will likely fare better than that disappointment, since Depp's international star power should bring in better worldwide business. It started with $24.3 million abroad, opening in about 30 per cent of its planned international market.While critics skewered the film, it did earn a decent B+ CinemaScore grade from moviegoers. But 'The Lone Ranger' is nevertheless likely to be a sizeable write-down for Disney and could impact the company's stock price when markets reopen Monday. Failure to launch: (from left) Executive producer Jerry Bruckheimer, actors Johnny Depp, Armie Hammer and director/producer Gore Verbinski at the Moscow Premiere of 'The Lone Ranger' 'Everybody beat up on ""The Lone Ranger"" pretty hard,' said Paul Dergarabedian, analyst for box-office tracker Hollywood.com. 'Everything was just not going in its favor.'On the other hand, Universal made 'Despicable Me 2' for the comparatively small amount of $76 million (a figure that doesn't count a huge marketing budget). The far-better than expected haul firmly establishes 'Despicable Me', which stars Steve Carell as a diabolical villain turned stay-at-home dad, as a new franchise for Universal and Chris Meledandri's Illumination Entertainment, the Universal-backed animation company. Humorous henchmen: The loyal but mischievous minions proved too popular with audiences for 'The Lone Ranger' to get a look-in . Sweet success: A scene from 'Despicable Me 2' featuring Lucy, voiced by Kristen Wiig (right) and Gru, voiced by Steve Carell (left) Nikki Rocco, head of distribution for Universal, attributed the strong performance to Meledandri, the robust appetite for summer family films, and, above all, those teaming little yellow guys. The minions will get their own spin-off in 2014, and Rocco said another 'Despicable Me' film is a certainty.'The minions steal everybody's heart,' Rocco said. 'It's a great time of the year to release a family film with broad appeal.'Stand-up Kevin Hart's concert documentary 'Kevin Hart: Let Me Explain' proved savvy counter-programming for Summit Entertainment, opening with $17.5 million over five days and $10.1 million over the weekend.Fox Searchlight's family comedy 'The Way, Way Back' (which also stars Carell) opened in 19 theaters with a strong theater average of about $30,000.

Sarah Murnaghan, the 10-year-old Pennsylvania girl who underwent a double lung transplant after her family petitioned to get her on the adult donor list, is recovering slowly and in 'a lot more pain.' The youngster, from Newtown Square, Pa., is still heavily sedated and intubated after being awoken from her medically-induced coma, her family told reporters. Sarah underwent surgery on June 12 and has been recovering ever since. Awake: Sarah Murnaghan, bottom, is awake after being in a medically-induced coma since transplant surgery on June 12 . Progress: Two days earlier, Sarah was taken off of a heavy-duty breathing machine, and she is now back on a traditional ventilator . 'Tougher 24 hours. We are weening (sic) sedation and some pain meds to make Sarah more awake in preparation for extubation, but she is in a lot more pain', her mother Janet Ruddock Murnaghan wrote in a Facebook post today. 'It's . a BIG thing for such a little girl, but we know she can do it! Praising . God for all the progress', NBCnews.com reported her mother saying. After lung transplant surgery, most patients have their breathing tubes removed within 24 hours and out of intensive care within a week, but while some are released from hospital within weeks, others take months. Family spokeswoman Tracy Simon said Sarah had been awake since last Friday and was able to answer yes or no questions by nodding. According to Simon, Sarah's family are excited to see their daughter doing so well, but reports that Sarah is frustrated because the tube is keeping her form speaking. Sarah suffers from cystic fibrosis, a disease which was killing her up until the transplant last week. Doctors had only given her a few weeks to live without new lungs. Since she was too young to be put on the adult donor list, she faced certain death since child donations are rare. She is making rapid progress. Two days . earlier she was taken off of a heavy-duty breathing machine and is now . using a traditional ventilator. Doing well: Ten-year-old Sarah Murnaghan is taking steps in the right direction after she underwent a double lung transplant, her mother Janet (right) said on Facebook . Sarah's plight sparked a national . debate over organ transplant policies, which until now barred children . younger than 12 from the adult waiting list. On June 12, Sarah's mother said that a set of lungs had become available for her daughter. 'God is great! He moved the mountain! Sarah got THE CALL,' a statement posted on her Facebook page read. 'Please pray for Sarah's donor, her HERO, who has given her the . gift of life.' That afternoon, Sarah's mother spoke to a reporter from Fox 29 . about her daughter's searching, describing the family as being nervous . but  'excited' about the surgery because doctors had given her child . about a week to live, and they were out of options. In this May 30, 2013 file photo provided by the Murnaghan family, Sarah Murnaghan, center, celebrates the 100th day of her stay in Children's Hospital of Philadelphia with her father, Fran, left, and mother, Janet . 'We're just so thankful for the donor,' Ruddock Murnaghan said, adding that while it is a great day for her, it is not lost on her that it is a tragic day for the donor's family, who had lost a loved one.

Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew won’t win any prizes in penmanship, but his official signature that made its debut Tuesday on the nation’s currency appears slightly better than the loopy scrawl he had a few months ago. Lew’s new and improved John Hancock was unveiled by the Treasury Department Tuesday in a tweet showing the evolved autograph at the bottom of a $5 bill. It takes the Bureau of Engraving and Printing about 18 weeks to put new engraving plates into production. That means Lew’s signature will not show up on the various currency denominations, beginning with the $5 bill, until sometime this fall. New and improved: The Treasury Department unveiled the official signature of Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew that will go on the nation's currency . Lew’s unintelligible signature had been so bad that President Barack Obama joked that unless it improved it would ‘debase our currency.’ The new signature is still hard to read but it does represent an improvement from previous signatures that were essentially a series of loops. Lew became Treasury secretary, succeeding Timothy Geithner, on February 28. While the signatures of Treasury secretaries have been appearing on the currency since 1914, Treasury chose a very modern way to release Lew’s signature. They tweeted it. Clarity: Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew's new signature was revealed in a Financial Stability and Oversight Committee document last week . Loopy: Lew's old signature was just a series of circles that looked nothing like his name . Treasury spokeswoman Suzanne Elio said . that Twitter was chosen ‘given the interest in the secretary’s . signature and the attention it has received through social media.’ Grownup signature: Treasury Secretary Jack Lew is seen penning his new John Hancock for printing on U.S. currency, which will appear in circulation in the fall . However, not everyone was pleased with Lew's revamped autograph. Many Twitter users grumbled about the . loss of his old whimsical signature, with at least one commenter . claiming that his current John Hancock looks more like 'Paul J Fres' rather than 'Jacob J Lew,' The Washington Post reported. When Mr Obama announced Lew’s nomination in January, he quipped that his pick for Treasury secretary would make strides to improve his zany signature. ‘Jack assures me that he is going to work to make at least one letter legible in order not to debase our currency should he be confirmed as secretary of the Treasury,’ the president said at the time. . Asked by NBC News to explain the change in Lew’s autograph, a Treasury Department spokeswoman would say only that it’s common for secretaries’ signatures to evolve once they start practicing for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. Lew's predecessor, Timothy Geithner, also changed his signature when he submitted it to be printed on currency notes. Scrawl: President Obama joked that Jack Lew's loopy signature could devalue the national currency at Lew's nomination in January . Lew, who was appointed to the post . earlier this year, created a media stir when his autograph - eight loops . that looked nothing like his name - was revealed as the one that would . grace all American paper money. But . in April, a document from the Financial Stability Oversight Council . showed Lew's signature to be legible, with a more pronounced 'J' and . 'L.' The change was first noticed by the Wall Street Journal. It is not known whether Lew took any handwriting or calligraphy classes in order to improve his signature. Money matters? If Lew kept the old signature, it would have looked like this on the dollar bill . Lew . poked fun at himself over his springlike autograph in the past, saying that he and Timothy Geithner have both struggled with signage. He . said that 'it was only yesterday that I discovered that we both share a . common challenge with penmanship.' Geithner also modified his signature to make it readable on currency. Lew, 57, was managing director for Citigroup from July 2006 until the end of 2008, when he joined the Obama administration as the president's chief of staff. Common problem: Lew wisecracked that he did not know that he shared a 'common challenge with outgoing Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, left, who had a similarly bad signature . Old version: Outgoing Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner used to have a signature like the one seen here . Improved: His signature, seen bottom right, showed his full name and was much more legible and controlled .","Treasury Departmetn tweeted a picture of Secretary Jacob Lew's improved signature on a $5 bill .

The parents of a 10-year-old Pennsylvania girl recovering after a double lung transplant have revealed that their daughter nearly died after complications with a first set of donor lungs and she has since had a second transplant. Sarah Murnaghan’s parents said Friday that their daughter had received the second transplant within days of the first failing and she has now recovered enough to open her eyes and take her first breaths. 'We’re not out of the woods, but Sarah’s health is trending in the right direction and we wanted to provide more detailed information as to what she has been going through,' the family said in a statement. Scroll down for video . The parents of Sarah Murnaghan have revealed that their daughter nearly died after complications with a first set of donor lungs and has since had a second transplant . Sarah suffers from late-stage cystic fibrosis, and her parents battle to be allowed an organ transplant provoked a national debate after she was initially denied one on the grounds that she was too young. Eventually they secured a court order to ensure she was placed in line for adult lungs because of the severity of her illness, rather than her age. Sarah suffered a ‘code blue’ emergency after the June 12 transplant of a first set of donor lungs at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia failed and she was placed on machines. Within three days, on June 15, a new set of lungs became available, her parents said. Those organs were infected with pneumonia, but the family agreed to take them because the organs represented Sarah’s last chance at life. Sarah Murnaghan's parents said Friday that their daughter had received a second transplant within days and has now recovered enough to open her eyes and take her first breaths . Janet Murnaghan speaks during a news conference outside Children's Hospital of Philadelphia on Friday . The child underwent a second surgery on June 21, after which she was awakened from a medically induced coma. The family, who had been so public about Sarah's situation, acknowledged they withheld details of her status. 'It was only then that we could allow ourselves to feel real hope and being posting some information on Facebook about Sarah’s progress,' the family statement said. Only days ago the parents released a statement saying their daughter was recovering slowly and in 'a lot more pain' without being more specific about what had happened.

'It's . a BIG thing for such a little girl, but we know she can do it! Praising . God for all the progress', NBCnews.com reported her mother saying. After lung transplant surgery, most patients have their breathing tubes removed within 24 hours and out of intensive care within a week, but while some are released from hospital within weeks, others take months. Family spokeswoman Tracy Simon said Sarah had been awake since last Friday and was able to answer yes or no questions by nodding. According to Simon, Sarah's family are excited to see their daughter doing so well, but reports that Sarah is frustrated because the tube is keeping her form speaking. Sarah suffers from cystic fibrosis, a disease which was killing her up until the transplant last week. Doctors had only given her a few weeks to live without new lungs. Since she was too young to be put on the adult donor list, she faced certain death since child donations are rare. She is making rapid progress.
