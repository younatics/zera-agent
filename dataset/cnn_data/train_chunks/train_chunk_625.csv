A great-grandmother was left embarrassed after having a driveway laid - just after the council had put a lamp post right in front of it. Pensioner Kathleen Annals had the work done before she applied to have the kerb dropped outside her property in Andover, Hampshire. And just days before the builders turned up to create the 10-yard driveway outside her detached home council workmen turned up to replace the lampposts. Blocked driveway: Mrs Annals had the new driveway installed outside her home after council workmen had put up the lamppost . Mrs Annals, who is believed to be aged in her 70s, doesn't drive but had the work done so her family could park their car when they come to visit. Hampshire County Council normally charge up to £1,200 to drop the kerb - although in this instance it may be higher because they have to move the lamppost. Widow Mrs Annals, who has lived in her £250,000 home for the last 30 years, admitted: 'Last year they issued parking space permits outside, I have no car since my husband died but I have friends and people come to visit and nowhere for them to park so I thought I should have a driveway put in. 'This lamppost was put in by the council, I had a small wall there at first. The contractor for the driveway said that he was going to put in to the council to have a dropped kerb and he's going to apply for the lamppost to be moved as well. 'He thought he would do the drive first then put in for it to be moved - it's all the wrong way round and now everybody has come and photographed it.' Mistake: Mrs Annals, who has lived in the property for more than 30 years, has now applied to the council to have the kerb dropped . Flashback: The property with a larger garden before Mrs Annals had a driveway fitted - and before a lamppost was fitted right outside . 'I had the work done because there was nowhere for my family to park when they visited me. But I have not got a parking space at the moment because of the lamp post.' A spokesman for the council confirmed they had now received a request from the pensioner to have the kerb dropped so cars can access her property. 'Clearly this will require the street light to be moved,' the spokesman said. 'We are assisting Mrs Annals with her application for dropped curb including making the necessary arrangements for the street light column to be moved. 'We would normally seek to recover the costs associated with work to lower a kerb or moving a street light. However each case is individually assessed and this is no exception. 'We will ensure that the work to provide a dropped curb and relocate the street light are co-ordinated to keep costs and any inconvenience to a minimum.'","Kathleen Annals had the new driveway installed after the lamppost went up .

Tony Blair will travel to Dallas this week for the opening of a presidential library dedicated to his Iraq War ally George W Bush. In a sign that the pair’s relationship is as close as ever, the former prime minister will attend the dedication of the institution, based at the Southern Methodist University. Mr Blair used an interview in the run-up to the event to deliver a fulsome tribute to the ex-president – saying he was a ‘much more rounded person’ than the ‘caricature’ suggests. Old friends: George W. Bush regularly met with Tony Blair when the two men were in power . The former Labour leader is accused by his critics of being Bush’s ‘poodle’ by agreeing so readily to commit British troops to the US-led invasion of Iraq, which was widely condemned as illegal. But Mr Blair is unrepentant, saying Thursday’s official opening of the George W Bush Presidential Center could be used to set his presidency into a broader perspective. He told the Washington Post: ‘Obviously, it’s a big moment for him. It’s a chance for him to explain that his political philosophy encompasses much more than the decisions he had to take after 9/11. ‘We forget this sometimes. This is a much more rounded person with many more dimensions to him than the caricature often portrays.’ Mr Blair insisted Mr Bush was more 'rounded' than the 'caricature' that is often portrayed . Bush in the bushed: The former President is being honoured with a library at the Southern Methodist University . Mr Blair also spoke up in favour of the Iraq War, which was launched by the two leaders in 2003 after faulty intelligence said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. And he said that Bush had not changed his attitude towards the decisions he had to make in the wake of the September 11 attacks. He said the former president believed the world was a safer place without Saddam in power. ‘There was never any doubt while he was in office, and there’s not any doubt now,’ said Mr Blair. ‘When . you see what is happening in Syria today, the sense of that argument is . evident. What it does is just make clear that these decisions are very . difficult. ‘If you intervene, it can be very tough. If you don’t intervene, it can also be very tough.’ The George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum, pictured, in Dallas opens to the public on May 1 . 9/11: A large part of the exhibit is dedicated to the 9/11 terrorist attacks .

All the living presidents, including President Barack Obama and Bush's father, George H.W. Bush, plan to attend the museum opening. It will open to the public on May 1. The museum uses everything from news clips to interactive screens to artifacts to tell the story of Bush's eight years in office. A container of chads — the remnants of the famous Florida punch cards — is part of an exhibit about the 2000 election, which Bush won after the Supreme Court ordered Florida to stop its recount process more than a month after Election Day. In the 9/11 display, called the 'Day of Fire,' video images from the attacks flash around a twisted metal beam recovered from the wreckage of the World Trade Center. The exhibit also includes the bullhorn Bush used days later to address a crowd of rescue workers at ground zero: 'I can hear you. The rest of the world hears you.

A possessive father killed his three children before throwing himself off a cliff after his wife developed a ‘schoolgirl crush’ on her  university lecturer, an inquest heard. Ceri Fuller, 35, drove his  children to a secluded beauty spot where he slashed and stabbed them with a hunting knife after finding out that his wife Ruth was leaving him. During a joint inquest into the four deaths, it emerged that tensions had developed between Mrs Fuller, a 35-year-old artist, and her husband because of her ‘flirty’ nature. Ceri Fuller, pictured on his wedding day to Ruth, was found dead at the foot of the 60ft cliff and his children (l - r) Rebecca, eight, Charlotte, seven and Sam, 12, suffered stab wounds to their necks, an inquest heard . Fuller's fingerprint was found on a hunting knife near the children's bodies . The inquest heard the mother of three . developed a liking for  academic Mark Lindley-Highfield, 38, who she met . at an Open University humanities course. Mrs Fuller started sending text messages to Mr Lindley-Highfield, including one in which she asked him to go out for a drink. She later claimed the invitation had been meant for her husband. Mrs Fuller sent five texts to Mr Lindley-Highfield between July 11 and 13 last year, and received six messages in reply. In one of the texts, she had referred . to a mid-life crisis, prompting Mr Lindley-Highfield to remind her of . the boundaries between a student and tutor. In a statement to the inquest, the . Gloucester University teacher said: ‘I received a text from Ruth asking . if I wanted to go and get a drink. ‘I then got another apologising and saying it was meant for someone called Ceri. I replied sarcastically that it was a shame.’ But the inquest was told that Mrs . Fuller and her husband were splitting up, and that the break-up had been . brought about by her feelings for Mr Lindley-Highfield. The alarm was raised in July last year when Samuel, 12, Rebecca, eight, and Charlotte, seven, failed to show up for school. Fuller had also missed his shift at a papermill in nearby Lyndey, Gloucestershire. After learning that her husband had . fled the family home in the village of Milkwall with their children, Mrs . Fuller was taken to hospital following an attempted suicide. Her sister, Joanne Ballard, said that . she was called to the house on the day that Fuller absconded with the . children, finding her sister in a ‘zoned out, edgy and anxious state’. While looking through her sister’s . phone at the property, Mrs Ballard found recent ‘loving texts between . Ruth and Ceri’ but also discovered her correspondence with Mr . Lindley-Highfield. Mrs Ballard told the court: ‘Ruth had told me she had a crush on Mark before. The children were found dead at a disused quarry in Poles Coppice and Fuller's Land Rover was parked nearby . Ceri Fuller, 35, was found at the bottom of the 60ft cliff in Pontesbury Hill, Shropshire, in July last year . ‘But she saw it as a schoolgirl crush . and wasn’t taking it further. We didn’t talk in depth about it because I . didn’t think it was very important.’ Mrs Ballard then asked her sister . about the relationship while she was at her hospital bedside. She said: ‘When she was in a cubical . at A&E at around 11.30pm in a moment of lucidity she said she and . Ceri had not had a row, but they had talked and he understood. ‘I asked her what they understood and she replied that they were splitting up. ‘I asked if it was linked to Mark and she looked at me and nodded her head clearly meaning yes.’ But Mrs Ballard insisted she had heard nothing to suggest that her sister was entering into a relationship with the tutor. Ruth Fuller's (pictured) sister Joanne Ballard said Ceri Fuller was 'unnaturally possessive' of his wife . She also revealed that her sister . suddenly woke up in the early hours of the morning while sitting at her . bedside, exclaiming: ‘I think Ceri killed Rebecca.’ Ruth Fuller's sister Joanna Ballard, pictured arriving at court with her partner, said Ceri Fuller enjoyed being the bread winner . Asked if Fuller had been ‘unnaturally . possessive’ towards his wife, she replied: ‘In my opinion yes, it was . more possessive than I would be comfortable with in a relationship. It . seemed to me that he seemed uncomfortable with Ruth wanting anything . that wasn’t being a mum.’ Ruth and Ceri were childhood friends . who were born in the same hospital and went to school together. They . started going out together when they were 21 and moved to Yorkshire. But Mrs Fuller hinted at the fragility of her relationship in a poignant blog written in 2006. She wrote: ‘For the longest time my . relationship with Ceri was very fragile and sometimes I still find it . hard to have faith in our strength as a couple.’ And only a day before . the horrific attack, Mrs Fuller wrote about having a ‘mid-life crisis’ on Facebook, saying she had done a ‘few completely bonkers things’. The . bodies of her children were discovered four days later next to the . family Land Rover 75 miles away at the Poles Coppice beauty spot, near . Shrewsbury. During harrowing evidence, the hearing . was told how the children had suffered ‘defensive’ injuries as they . tried to protect themselves from their father. All three children had . suffered a ‘large incised wound’ to the throat, before their bodies were . dumped in woodland. Pathologist Dr Alexander Kolar told . the hearing in Wem, Shropshire, that Samuel died from a single neck . wound, while his two sisters suffered multiple stab injuries, including . wounds to the chest. Their father was found dead nearby at the foot of a 60ft cliff. A six-inch bowie knife with blood-stained fingerprints matching Mr Fuller’s was found at the scene of the murder. The hearing continues.

"By . Deborah Arthurs . UPDATED: . 16:14 EST, 7 March 2012 . A raunchy advertisement by upmarket lingerie firm Agent Provocateur showing four scantily clad women 'kidnapping' a woman in her own home has been cleared by advertising bosses. Despite one complainant calling the video 'misogynistic and disturbing', the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) deemed it 'unlikely to cause widespread offence'. The ASA launched an investigation into the film in November after receiving just one single complaint. Yesterday they announced it was fit to be aired. The video ad, shown on the firm's website and on YouTube, shows a brunette at home in a diaphanous dressing gown being terrorised by a quartet of beautiful women dressed in peep-hole bras and knickers. Horror: In the film, a brunette living alone in the woods is attacked by vampire-like models in lingerie. Agent Provocateur said the video was their take on the horror genre, and that it fitted in with their 'eroticism vibe' Invaders: After dominating the brunette, the lingerie-clad women writhe on the floor and pose provocatively together - moves which appear to terrorise their prisoner . The captors wear barely there lingerie as they stalk their victim . The two-minute advert for the Soiree . Gold collection has the feel of a traditional horror film, where the . action begins in the dead of night in an apartment surrounded by trees. The phone rings and the woman answers - but hears nothing. It rings again and she answers, hearing only female laughter. Suddenly, two stunning models lurch up from the floor outside her window wearing black lingerie and thigh-high boots - one flashing her breasts. The woman shrieks in terror before the same women appear directly in front of her - staring into her eyes. To pounding horror music the woman runs off slamming doors behind her in a desperate bid to escape the intruders before being confronted by another pair of women - one in red leopard print lingerie and another in peep-hole bra and suspenders. The spot, called Fleurs Du Mal (Flowers Of Evil) sees the menacing beauties terrify the brunette with raunchy poses . The intruders look seductively into one another's eyes . The film was inspired by the Hammer films of the 1950s and 60s, as well as the erotic classic Vampyros Lesbos from 1971 . She lets out a piercing scream and, overcome with fear, she collapses. The screen goes black and the next scene shows her being dragged across the floor, seemingly unconscious and exposing one of her own breasts before being confronted by all four models. The victim reels in horror as she watches the rampant sexbots pose provocatively in front of her. Moments later, she is overcome and falls to the white carpet where she is ravished by all four of them. Suddenly, she lurches up from the floor just as her captors did in the earlier scenes of the film. She is now wearing her own set of revealing Agent Provocateur lingerie - apparently having been converted to their vampire clan. She looks seductively into the camera while the other four women stand behind her. Overcome with fear, the brunette faints, where she is apparently ravished by the captors . The short film attracted one complaint from a viewer who said the ad was offensive as it was misogynistic and disturbing. The ASA described the advertisement thus: 'A video on the Agent Provocateur website showed a woman in a nightgown in her home. 'She was shown answering the telephone before several women, who were wearing revealing lingerie with stockings and long boots, appeared at the window. 'The women were shown dragging the other woman through the house and adopted a series of poses, some sexual, alone and with the other women. 'The group of women appeared to attack the woman's body; she then she re-appeared wearing similar revealing lingerie to the group.' The brunette springs from the floor, apparently converted to the models' clan, wearing an ivory set of similar lingerie and her hair tied up in the same style . Heads at the lingerie firm said the video was shot to promote its new limited edition Soiree 2011-2012 collection and was a 'unique take on the horror genre' which fitted in with the firm's signature 'sensibility and eroticism' vibe. They said the gown worn by the victim was reminiscent of those worn in 1950s Hammer House of Horror movies and that the style suited the company because 'in the past horror was the only way of showing sex in a film'. Agent Provocateur added that 'sex and horror had always been woven together but, they understood, had never been parodied in a film for a fashion label' and that the video had been viewed by 450,000 people. The ASA cleared the ad, stating: 'We acknowledged some viewers might find some of the scenes distasteful but considered the highly stylised nature and clearly fictional content of the video meant it was unlikely to be interpreted by most viewers in the way the complainant suggested. 'We considered the ads did not demean women and were unlikely to cause serious or widespread offence to visitors to the Agent Provocateur website.' 'We also considered the ad was unlikely to cause fear or distress without justifiable reason. We therefore concluded that the ad did not breach the Code.' It is not the first time the lingerie brand has attracted controversy with its advertising campaigns. In 2001 an Agent Provocateur advert featuring Kylie Minogue was banned by the BBC. Available to be viewed online, it went on to be one of the most viewed videos in history, with an estimated 360million people watching. WATCH THE FILM .

As summer arrives and sleeveless dresses hit the shops, many women will look mournfully at their less-than-toned arms. It is, therefore, possibly no surprise that plastic surgery to reshape the upper arm is soaring in popularity. The latest statistics released by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) show that arm lifts in women have rocketed more than 4,000 per cent in the last decade. Michelle Obama's toned arms are thought to be inspiring people to undergo arm lift procedures . The report says that the trend is fuelled, in part, by sleeveless fashions and more focus on strong-armed celebrities. In 2000, more than 300 women had upper arm lift procedures in America. Last year, more than 15,000 did. Brachioplasty is a procedure to remove excess skin and fatty tissue from the upper arm. It is normally carried out under general anaesthetic and involves a cut being made from the elbow up to the armpit. This allows for the removal of the excess tissue meaning that the circumference of the arm reduces. The procedure leaves a thin scar along the inside of the arm. Complications involve persistent swelling of the arm, infection, bruising and bleeding. There can also be nerve damage which causes numbness in the arm. Upper arm lifts can include liposuction or a surgical procedure known as brachioplasty, in which loose skin is removed from the back of the arms. ‘Women are paying more attention to their arms in general and are becoming more aware of options to treat this area,’ said ASPS President Gregory Evans. ‘For some women, the arms have always been a troublesome area and, along with proper diet and exercise, liposuction can help refine them. ‘Others may opt for a brachioplasty when there is a fair amount of loose skin present with minimal elasticity.’ Doctors say there is no single reason behind the increase, though celebrities from the White House to the red carpet may be having an influence. A recent poll conducted on behalf of ASPS found that women are paying closer attention to the arms of female celebrities. Actresses Jennifer Aniston (left) and Jessica Biel (right) have some of the most admired arms . According to the poll, women most admire the arms of first lady Michelle Obama, followed closely by Jennifer Aniston. Actresses Jessica Biel and Demi Moore, and daytime TV talk show host Kelly Ripa, were also recognised for their toned arms. ‘I think we are always affected by the people that we see consistently, either on the big screen or on TV,’ said ASPS Public Education Committee Chair David Reath. ‘We see them and think, “yeah, I'd like to look like that”.’ That is what happened to 24-year-old Natalie Robinson of Knoxville, who says she was inspired by the arms of the first lady. ‘I looked at Michelle Obama and said “Oh my gosh, I want her arms”. When I first started losing weight and started to tone up, I had her image in my head.’ That was three years ago. Today, Ms Robinson has lost more than 12 stone and continues an amazing transformation through diet and exercise. Actress Demi Moore (left) and talk show host Kelly Ripa (right) were also named as people with enviable arms . However, despite losing so much weight, Ms Robinson says she still was not entirely happy. ‘I had a lot of excessive skin around my upper arms,’ she said. ‘Every time I looked in the mirror there was a reminder of a heavier person and I just couldn't get rid of it.’ As a result, Ms Robinson contacted Dr Reath, who performed a brachioplasty. ‘Natalie had the perfect arms for this procedure,’ said Dr Reath, ‘but it's not for everybody.’ In . 2012, 15,457 people in the U.S. had an arm lift. This was an increase . of three per cent since 2011 and 4,473 per cent since 2000. Of those patients, 15,136 were women. The surgery is most popular with patients over 40. The majority, 43 per cent, of patients were aged between 40 and 54, 33 per cent were over 55. The average cost of the operation was £2,500. A brachioplasty requires an incision from the elbow to the armpit, generally on the back of the arm, leaving a visible and permanent scar. For Ms Robinson, the scar was much easier to deal with than the excessive skin, but Dr Reath warns patients to carefully consider the pros and cons before having an upper arm lift, particularly a brachioplasty. ‘It's a trade-off. We get rid of the skin, but we leave a scar,’ he said. ‘So, as long as there's enough improvement to be made in the shape of the arm to justify the scar, then it's a great procedure.’ Dr Reath stresses the importance of proper diet and exercise as part of a healthy lifestyle to all his patients, but says some women simply cannot achieve the look they want on their own. Many who simply want to tighten and tone their upper arms, but don't have a lot of excess skin, opt for liposuction instead of a brachioplasty. ‘We are genetically programmed to have different accumulations of fat in different areas, and for some women the arms can be a problem area,’ said Dr Reath. ‘The arms are a very noticeable area and if excessive fat and skin are an issue, they tend to look more out of proportion than the rest of the body.’ That was certainly the case for Ms Robinson, but not anymore. She says she never expected surgery to make her arms perfect, just more normal. ‘Well-proportioned is what I was going for, and I'm very happy. It was well worth the investment,’ she said. ‘I would do it again.’","In 2000, 300 women in the U.S. had surgery to reshape their upper arms .

It is well known that obesity in adulthood poses a risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease, but previously it had not been clear whether obesity in early adulthood strengthens that risk. Men who are obese in their twenties are eight times more likely to suffer diabetes, potentially fatal blood clots or a heart attack . Danish researchers tracked the health of 6,500 Danish 22-year-old men for 33 years up to the age of 55. All the men were born in 1955 and had registered with the Military Board for a fitness test to gauge their suitability for military service. All potential conscripts in Denmark are subjected to a battery of psychological and physical tests, including weight. Over 80 per cent were within the normal range and five per cent were underweight. One in 10 were overweight and just over one per cent - equating to 97 men -  were obese. Normal weight is classified as a body mass index (BMI) of between 18.5 and 25; obesity is classified as a BMI of 30 or more. Almost half of those classified as obese at the age of 22 were diagnosed with diabetes, high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, blood clots in the legs or lungs, or had died before reaching the age of 55. They were eight times more likely to get diabetes as their normal weight peers and four times as likely to get a potentially fatal blood clot. The study found that youth provides no protection against the dangers of carrying excess weight . They were also more than twice as likely to develop high blood pressure, have had a heart attack, or to have died. Every unit increase in BMI corresponded to an increased heart attack rate of five per cent, high blood pressure and blood clot rates of 10 per cent, and an increased diabetes rate of 20 per cent. In total, obese young men were three times as likely to get any of these serious conditions as their normal weight peers by middle age, conferring an absolute risk of almost 50 per cent compared with only 20 per cent among their normal weight peers. The findings, published in the BMJ, have prompted researchers to warn that the continuing rise in obesity may counteract the fall in deaths from heart disease. They said: 'Obesity-related morbidity and mortality will, in decades to come, place an unprecedented burden on healthcare systems worldwide.'","Has been known for some time that being overweight increases risk of diabetes and heart disease .

Much of the flesh on the producer's foot had  been stripped away exposing some of his bones. Alongside the original photo, a caption read: 'Our man vs wild producer suffering from a brutal snakebite - fighting the injury with courage.' Despite his horrific injury Mr Rankin was said to be on the mend having undergone surgery. He posted a picture of the foot post-surgery on Twitter and said: 'Thanks Bear for your good wishes', before telling a follower: 'Resting up.' The original picture by Bear has since gone viral and received many horrified reactions from some of the adventurer's 1million followers.

"By . David Wilkes and Emine Sinmaz . PUBLISHED: . 16:00 EST, 26 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 01:58 EST, 27 October 2012 . A cold-call firm has been forced to pay compensation to a businessman after he took it to court for wasting his time. The stunning victory could open the floodgates to further claims from the millions of homeowners plagued by similar unwanted and infuriating calls. Richard Herman vowed to hit back after he was targeted by firms promising compensation for mis-sold Payment Protection Insurance (PPI). Victory: Richard Herman at his home Sunbury-on-Thames in Surrey invoiced a 'cold caller' for his time and they paid up . The 53-year-old turned the tables by invoicing one of the firms for £10 for every minute he wasted answering their telephone calls. He also recorded the calls, meaning that when the unscrupulous company denied ever having rung him, he was armed with incontrovertible proof to the contrary. He offered to send the firm the recordings but they ignored him, so he took his case to the small claims court. The claim stated: ‘Invoice is for the use of time, phone and electricity for receiving telemarketing communications’. Richard Herman's Court Claim against PPI Claimline . In a victory for the little man, marketing company AAC, which sells referrals to claims management companies, agreed to pay the full £195 for 19-and-a-half minutes of calls, plus a £25 court fee. Yesterday, Mr Herman said: ‘I was feeling oppressed that I was getting called by these companies. Once I sent the company the invoice, I felt as though the boot was on the other foot. I wasn’t the victim any more.’ He is urging others targeted by cold-callers to follow his example. The nuisance calls – often using a pre-recorded voice message to set out an initial sales pitch – try to convince you that they can secure thousands of pounds in refunds of PPI, insurance supposed to cover debts if you fall ill or cannot work. The county court has a ‘small claims track’ to handle claims for less than £5,000, or £1,000 for personal injury or housing disrepair. The process is designed to be cheap and quick and should not require a solicitor. 1) When it’s worth making a claimBefore you make a small claim you need to show you have given the other party a clear opportunity to pay up. Write a letter saying how much they owe and what for, and a warning that you will make a court claim if you do not receive the money beyond a reasonable deadline. It is worth seeking advice from a Citizen’s Advice Bureau or law centre before starting your action. 2) How to get the ball rollingIf the debtor does not respond in time, you can submit your small claims forms. These are available online – search for form ‘N1’ at hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk – and cost £25 for claims up to £300, rising to £100 for claims up to £5,000. If you are successful in your claim, the other party will be liable for this fee. 3) What next?The defendant has two weeks to respond to the court. Hopefully they will not contest the case and pay up. But if they do, the court will allocate a hearing date, which often takes months. 4) In courtThe two parties present their cases to a judge. Your main aim is to prove the debt exists. You can take a ‘lay representative’ to speak on your behalf – it could be a relative or a friend. But if you decide to hire a solicitor you will probably have to foot the bill yourself – even if you win. They try to get hold of your personal details then pass them on to greedy claims-management companies desperate to grab a share of a £9billion compensation pot made available after Britain’s banks were found to have routinely mis-sold PPI. The claims firms typically pocket a third of the compensation paid out. This means they stand to make £80million this year from a record 165,000 complaints about PPI. Mr Herman, of Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey, said: ‘They told me I had had a £3,500 loan with Halifax which was astonishing to me because I had never had an account with Halifax.’ He described the disruption caused to him and wife Ruth, 67, as they rushed to answer the phone so as not to miss a chat with friends or their three grown-up children. Mr Herman said: ‘Once I was out in the garden eating and picking raspberries and had the telephone with me in case the children called. I was sat in the sun enjoying myself but one of these blasted companies called me – it was infuriating. ‘We’re all busy rushing around all day long, so when we snatch four minutes by ourselves for a bit of peace and quiet, the last thing you want is to be intruded upon by these irrelevant companies.’ His annoyance was doubled because he was registered on the Telephone Preference Service, intended to block nuisance calls. So the next time Mr Herman was harassed on behalf of the same claims management company, PPI Claimline, he said: ‘I’m fed up with you calling me. If you call me again I’ll charge you £10 a minute for my time.’ He recalled: ‘I hoped and presumed that that would be the end of it, naturally. But to my astonishment, a couple of days later, they called me again.’ Mr Herman, who owns call-recording company Retell Recorders, sent PPI Claimline an invoice for £195 but the company denied it or any marketing company acting on its behalf had called him. But as he had recorded the calls, Mr Herman had proof. Marketing firm AAC, which made the call on PPI’s behalf, settled Mr Herman’s claim on September 14 before the case appeared before a judge. Yesterday PPI Claimline said: ‘PPI Claimline and its suppliers only contact people who have opted in to such approaches. We have audited the details regarding the calls to Mr Herman and have found that he had indeed consented to be contacted. ‘We would like to draw a clear line between the two calls to Mr Herman made on behalf of PPI Claimline and any other calls he received, which were nothing to do with PPI Claimline or its suppliers.’ Mr Herman has now set up a website – www.saynotocoldcalls.com – to help other victims, and is appearing on BBC Radio 4’s Money Box programme at midday today.

Scientists have embarked on one of the strangest experiments ever - to see whether atoms of exotic antimatter fall up instead of down. Antimatter is weird stuff, being a kind of mirror image of ordinary matter with an opposite electric charge. When an atom of normal matter meets its antimatter counterpart the two annihilate each other in a flash of light. At the Alpha laboratory, antimatter protons - antiprotons - are combined with antielectrons, or 'positrons', to make atoms of antihydrogen . That much scientists already know. What is much less certain is whether antimatter has fundamental properties that are different from normal matter - especially the way it is affected by gravity. A few experts have proposed the outlandish idea that antimatter might be repelled by the gravity - in other words, that it falls up. One reason for the mystery is that antimatter is extremely rare in nature and to date has only been made in tiny quantities in laboratories. Artificially-created atoms of antimatter are suspended in magnetic traps, and nobody has ever looked to see what happens when it is 'dropped'. Now scientists have taken the first steps towards answering this question. A paper reported in the journal Nature Communications describes the first direct measurement of gravity's effect on antimatter. Unfortunately, the results are still too uncertain to resolve the riddle of what happens to antimatter in free-fall. Lead scientist Professor Joel Fajans, from the University of California at Berkeley, US, said: 'This is the first word, not the last. 'We've taken the first steps toward a direct experimental test of questions physicists and non-physicists have been wondering about for more than 50 years. Scientists have embarked on to establish whether antimatter falls 'up'. The question is, does normal hydrogen (left, with a negatively charged electron orbiting a positively charged proton) weigh the same as antihydrogen (a positively charged positron orbiting a negatively charged antiproton)? 'Is there such a thing as anti-gravity? Based on free-fall tests so far, we can't say yes or no. 'We certainly expect antimatter to fall down, but just maybe we will be surprised.' The work was conducted at Cern, the European Centre for Nuclear Research in Geneva, Switzerland, home of the Alpha (Antihydrogen Laser Physics Apparatus) experiment. At the Alpha laboratory, antimatter protons - antiprotons - are combined with antielectrons, or 'positrons', to make atoms of antihydrogen. These can be stored for just a few seconds in a magnetic trap. The scientists set about studying how the antihydrogen falls out of the trap when the magnetic field is switched off. What sounds simple is actually a very tricky operation. When the magnets are turned off, the anti-atoms quickly touch the ordinary matter of the trap's walls and are immediately destroyed. The scientists set about studying how the antihydrogen falls out of the trap when the magnetic field is switched off. What sounds simple is actually a very tricky operation. When the magnets are turned off, the anti-atoms quickly touch the ordinary matter of the trap's walls and are immediately destroyed. To discover the fate of the antimatter atoms it is necessary to pinpoint where and when they are annihilated and to measure their precise location and velocity the moment the trap is turned off. Alpha's magnetic fields do not turn off instantly, and almost 30 thousandths of a second pass before they decay to near zero. Meanwhile, annihilation flashes occur all over the trap walls at different times and places depending on the antiatoms' original but unknown locations, velocities and energies. So far the scientists have been able to determine two things. If an antihydrogen atom falls downward, its gravitational mass can be no more than 110 times greater than its inertial mass. If it falls up, its gravitational mass is at most 65 times greater. Gravitational mass is the mass of a body as measured by its gravitational attraction to other bodies. It generates the 'weight' of a massive body attracted to the Earth. Inertial mass is the mass of a body as measured by how strongly it is accelerated by a given force. Alpha is now being upgraded and should provide more precise data once the experiment resumes next year. 'We need to do better and we hope to do so in the next few years,' said co-author Professor Jonathan Wurtele, also from the University of California at Berkeley.","Experts have proposed the outlandish idea that antimatter might be repelled by the gravity .

It's certainly a romantic gesture - putting a message in a bottle and throwing it into the sea in the hope it reaches its destination. But perhaps it's not the most practical way of expressing yourself, as one bottle took 28 years to be discovered - nearly 5,000 miles away. In 1985 a man called Jonathon penned the note 'Mary, you are really great person. I hope we can keep in correspondence. I said I would write. Your friend forever, Jonathon, Nova Scotia, 1985,' tucked it into a bottle, and threw it into the Atlantic ocean. A man called Jonathon is believed to have thrown the bottle containing a sentimental note into the Atlantic . The bottle washed up in Ploce - almost 4,000 miles from where it believed to have been flung in the sea . Now, finally, it has been washed ashore and discovered in Croatia, almost 8,000 kilometres (4,971 miles) away. The message, written in blue ink with a ball-point pen was still intact because it was plastic coated, and found by 23-year-old Croatian Matea Medak Rezic, Yahoo reported. 'The bottle was among the rubbish that winter rains have brought to the shore,' Rezic told AFP. Ms Rezic, who found the sentimental note as she helped with a beach clean-up near the Adriatic port of Ploce, near Dubrovnik, is now appealing for the mystery pair to come forward. She has posted a picture of the note and bottle on Facebook, writing: 'Message in a Bottle! From Canada to the Neretva River estuary for 28 years!!' The Province reported. The bottle was thrown into the ocean in Nova Scotia in 1985 and turned up in Croatia 28 years later . The message in a bottle took 28 years to be washed ashore - and now the finer is trying to reach the writer . Twitter users have speculated about the relationship between the couple, and how Jonathon could have expected it to reach Mary. If the bottle was thrown from Nova Scotia, it could have travelled across the Atlantic and into the Mediterranean Sea. To reach the Adriatic Sea, it is possible that it could have gone through the Strait of Gibralter. It certainly took a lot longer than a romantic message-in-a-bottle from China, which took just six days to be washed ashore on a Scottish beach and discovered by a mother and daughter. Last August Nicola MacFarlane, 41, and daughter Lucy, four, from Portobello, near Edinburgh, were scouring Portobello Beach when they came across an old glass bottle sticking out of the sand containing  a note inside written in Mandarin. While the letter bears the date in line with the lunar calendar - July 7, 2012 - it could have been sent off as recently as six days previously if it followed the modern calendar.","Bottle believed to have travelled nearly 5,000 miles to reach Croatia .

But while some resort to earplugs or double-glazing to shut out the din, some ingenious pupils close to Heathrow airport have found a novel way to fight the roar of jet engines - by building 'Teletubby' shaped domes. Hounslow Heath infants' school has erected four igloo-like adobe domes in its grounds, of a type normally used in earthquakes and emergency zones, to muffle the noise. Students from Hounslow Heath infants school play around one of four adobe huts designed to help minimise the noise of aircraft landing at Heathrow airport . The playground is directly under the flight path of Heathrow's southern runway and outside play for the children is interrupted every two minutes or so by landing aircraft passing over their heads . The playground is directly under the flight path of Heathrow's southern runway and outside play for the children is interrupted every two minutes or so by landing aircraft passing over their heads. 'When children were playing outside, they had nowhere to go - they were subjected to that noise,' said the school's principal Kathryn Harper-Quinn. The domes, an invention of Iranian architect Nader Khalili, were originally meant for lunar settlements and were first employed in a refugee crisis after the 1990-91 Gulf war, but they work just fine for the children in west London too. 'For play time it's fantastic that they have somewhere to withdraw - even the ones that are too young to articulate that they're feeling concerned about the noise,' Ms Harper-Quinn said. The domes have no doors so are an open space but with a 'strong psychological and physical barrier' against the noise, she said. She estimates that when outside, teachers are inaudible to pupils for 25 seconds in every 90 because of the jets.

The domes have no doors so are an open space but have a 'strong psychological and physical barrier' against the noise . 'You can still hear the planes in the huts but you can also hear your own voice,' she said. The school teaches 520 infants aged between three and seven and its experiment with the domes has prompted others in the area to consider following suit. Planes pass just 180 metres (600 ft) over the area and their engines emit a noise level of 87 decibels. Sound tests inside the domes showed a noise reduction of over 17 decibels and a considerable reduction in the duration of the noise, according to the website of Small Earth which makes the structures. The domes, which have also been installed in the Himalayan foothills of Nepal, are made out of bags of coiled earth tubes in an igloo-shape. The technology avoids using expensive construction materials and the cost of transporting them.

'I can carry a three-bedroomed house on my back,' said Julian Faulkner, chief executive of Small Earth. 'A couple of rolls of barbed wire and a roll of tubing and you're there!' Soil dug from the construction site is compressed into tubular bags which are laid one on top of the other to form walls. Barbed wire is placed between the layers to hold the bags together. The bags are laid in a circle with a decreasing diameter of the rows towards the top. Aircraft noise is a thorny political issue for the government, as it tries to establish where and how to expand airport capacity. Business leaders and airlines are pressing him to expand Heathrow, a move which would affect the 750,000 people living under the flight path. Options for increasing capacity at London Heathrow airport include a third runway and allowing planes to land and take-off on its two runways at the same time instead of the current alternating pattern. 'Having quiet time is absolutely critical. To lose runway alternation would be a disaster,' said Harper-Quinn.","Planes pass just 180 metres (600 ft) over the area .

Now Michael Alleyne (left) - the father of one of his killers - has received £20,000 compensation from police for injuries and 'trauma' he suffered when they raided his flat . Broken-hearted: Ben's parents Deborah and George Kinsella said they were devastated at the cash award . At the time, £10,000 was the most the law allowed for criminal injuries . compensation. Mr Alleyne was injured when officers raided his Islington flat while searching for his 18-year-old son on the ­morning after Ben’s death. He said he was kicked in the eye and had his ankle broken as police handcuffed him to the ground, also claiming he suffered post traumatic stress. Thug: Michael Alleyne Jr was one of three men jailed for Ben's murder . Police had a warrant for Alleyne Jr’s arrest, but he had already fled. A court was told last year that during the tense raid Mr Alleyne’s pitbull terrier was Tasered and sprayed with a fire extinguisher. But George and Debbie Kinsella, also from Islington, said today: 'As a family the last four and a half years have been a total nightmare, since losing our Ben in such a horrific, violent and senseless murder. We will always live that nightmare. 'We are devastated by the decision and feel that our system aids and favours perpetrators and their families, not the victims.' Mr Kinsella told The Sunday Mirror today: 'Officers apparently had no choice but to force entry. They told us they had to Taser the dog and somehow Alleyne Sr got ­trampled.' Mr Alleyne has now been handed £20,000 in public money as compensation for the injuries and 'trauma'. Mr Kinsella added: 'Why can’t I sue him for a ­broken heart?

Star pupil and promising artist Ben was stabbed 11 times in a street after a night out celebrating the end of his GCSEs. Alleyne Jr is currently serving a life sentence for his killing. While the Kinsellas do not deny that Mr Alleyne was injured, or even that he should have the right to compensation, they were horrified at the ­discrepancy ­between his payout and theirs, which was spent on Ben’s funeral.

On Tuesday's show the couple hit back . at those who describe them as scroungers, arguing that because their . hard-working parents have paid tax all their lives, they are entitled to . claim some of the money back. Gina, who has worked for Sainsburys in the past said: 'I don’t see that we’re living off the taxpayers, we’re entitled to the money our parents paid all their lives.' She also claimed that because the pair have paid tax in the past, their daughter should also be entitled to claim benefits in future. 'We have paid into the system as well . and you know, if our daughter wants to claim when she's older, she can. We're not . going to claim benefits forever so we are going to pay into the system at some point.' The pair receive £1,473 per month in benefits or £17,680 per year. This works out at £340 per week, which includes £140 housing benefit, £60 child tax credit, £20 child benefit and £110 Jobseekers Allowance. Weekly outgoings include £60 on food, £22.50 on TV, £3.50 on their TV licence plus utility bills, which the pair say they receive no help with. According to Gina, their 47"" flat screen TV is their only luxury, although Danny also admits to smoking roll-up cigarettes which are also paid for by tax payers.

'What is the point [of a minimum wage job]? You know, I'm not going to go to work to be worse off.' he argued. Gina added: 'The main problem is is that the cost of living is going up so much but the wages are just the same. But people still expect you to live on the minimum wage - I don't think that's right.' When pressed the pair maintained that they will carry on living on benefits until Danny gets a job that pays enough or 'the system changes'. 'We'll carry on until the system changes if Danny doesn't get a job,' said Gina. Danny added: 'We can't be scroungers because the Government wouldn't give us the money or pay towards our living expenses . if we didn't need it.' Taxes: The duo say they are right to claim benefits because their parents have paid taxes all their lives . Unfortunately for Danny and Gina, the change in the system they so dread isn't far away. In a statement read out on This Morning, the Department for Work and Pensions said: 'We have to end the absurdity in the . welfare system where people are better off claiming benefits than they . are in work. 'Universal Credit will ensure that work will always pay and . people who can work will no longer be able to count on the state to fund . a life on benefits.' Asked what they intend to do when the new system is introduced, Gina quickly replied: 'He'd have to get a job I suppose.'

The pilots of an international flight forgot to lower the landing gear and had to abort touch-down at just 500ft because the captain was distracted by his mobile phone, air safety investigators have found. Australian Jetstar flight JQ57 was making its approach to Singapore's Changi International Airport on May 27, 2010 and was less than 2,500 feet above the tarmac when the captain's mobile phone messaging alert sounded. The first officer twice tried to get the captain's attention to set a 'missed-approach altitude' and when he looked over noticed the 'captain was preoccupied with his mobile phone,' an official report into the incident said. Blunder: The pilots of an Australian Jetstar passenger jet like this one were forced to abort a landing the because the captain got distracted by his mobile phone . The captain, who had more than 13,400 hours' flying experience, said he was in the process of unlocking and turning off his mobile phone and had not noticed his first officer's request. It wasn't until the plane was at 700ft that the first officer realised the landing gear was not down. But when the Airbus A321 dipped below 500ft with the landing gear still being deployed, the Ground Proximity Warning System alarm sounded and the pilots aborted the landing. Now the Australian Transport Safety Board has found the pilots had failed to perform a number of tasks to prepare for landing including lowering the landing gear, completing the landing checklist, selecting auto break and checking the flight parameters. A man who threatened the crew on an all-night Qantas flight across Australia had to be restrained by other passengers after a stewardess cried for help. Women wept and passengers grew concerned as the man walked through the aisle of the jet shouting abuse and threatening staff and the pilots. When he attacked another male passenger, a stewardess cried out: 'Please help! Please help!' Other passengers jumped up to her aid, tackled the man and held him down as crew members tied his hands behind his back. The drama occurred on QF648 after it had taken off from Perth on Wednesday night for the four-hour flight to Melbourne. 'I don't know what was wrong with him. He was threatening staff, he was threatening the pilot - it was pretty scary stuff,' a passenger who gave his name as Rob told Radio Triple M. A Qantas spokesman said he could not confirm why the man had to be restrained. Jetstar pilots are bound by the same rules as passengers when it comes to mobile phones and they should be switched off during take off and landing and only used in 'flight mode' when at altitude. Safety investigators said phone records showed the captain did not send or answer any text messages during the approach. The use of the mobile phone was just one of several distractions that led to the missed landing, the report said. The pilots' attention was also broken by a request to slow the aircraft earlier than anticipated, a discussion by the crew of the Singapore skyline and a late detection of an auto pilot-related warning light. Despite the near miss, the Transport Safety Board made no findings against Jetstar or its procedures. The airline said it had made the flight a case study in its training manual and had added an item to pilots take-off checklist reminding them to turn off their mobile phones. 'We take a very conservative approach to how far before touchdown an aircraft should be completely configured for landing,' Jetstar chief pilot Mark Rindfleish said. 'In the case of JQ57, pilot distraction meant all the landing checklist items weren't completed before the aircraft passed an altitude of 500ft, at which point a go-around was required under our operating procedures. 'Human factors, like distraction, are why airlines have so many procedural safeguards built into how they fly. A Jetstar spokesman said the airline counselled the pilots 'on human factors that lead to distraction in the cockpit.'","Australian Jetstar crew forgot to lower landing gear .

Labour will today vote against plans to cap increases in welfare handouts at one per cent for the next three years. But some Labour MPs believe Ed Miliband (right) and Ed Balls (left) are wrong to oppose the cap . The IFS said 7million workers would lose an average of £165 a year, while  2.8million without a job will lose £215 a year in 2015-16 – a £50 bigger hit to those who don’t work. Ministers say a working couple will also see their income tax cut by £1,200 as a result of changes to the personal  allowance, which come in from April, far outweighing the losses to tax credits. Former home secretary Jacqui Smith said it will let the Tories 'paint us as a party which cares more about those unwilling to work than those struggling in work' But the IFS also revealed that the proportion of those hit by the changes would fall far more heavily on the workless. While nine in ten workless households will see their entitlements reduced, 3million of the 7million working families hit will be affected only by a cap in rises to child benefit and only 4million will lose out as a result of other changes. If just working tax credits are counted, three out of ten people in work will lose out. Today’s vote has been called by the Government to try to lay out a key dividing line ahead of the next election.

Professional gambler Bebb-Jones was arrested in 2009 in a raid at his home in Kidderminster, Worcestershire. Prosecutors said he went on to spend thousands of dollars on his wife's credit cards before shooting himself in the head in a botched suicide attempt. He then moved back to the UK with their son, who was three at the time. Bebb-Kones then became a well-known competitor on the UK poker circuit, winning £90,000 in the Grosvenor Grand Prix in 2007, reports the Birmingham Mail. The 49-year-old lost his appeal against extradition to the US in 2011 and was due to stand trial. In February, he pleaded guilty at a hearing in the 9th Judicial District Court in Glenwood Springs, Colorado. After the admission, his wife's family asked for: 'the maximum penalty for his cruelty, lack of remorse and for taking Sabrina from them.' He will be sentenced today in Colorado and could face up to 20 years in prison. District Attorney Sherry Caloia said Bebb-Jones had made a plea bargain, admitting murder in the second degree, blaming it on 'heat of passion', in exchange for a sentence of no more than 20 years. It is possible the judge could reject the plea bargain, which would mean the case would go back to negotiations, or to trial, but this is thought to be unlikely. Prosecutors said Bebb-Jones gave a number of differing accounts of the day his wife disappeared but in each one he claimed that she had walked out on him after an argument while they were on a day trip. Bebb-Jones, pictured after qualifying for a poker final in Birmingham, returned to the UK after a botched suicide attempt . An employee at their hotel reported Sabrina missing on September 18, 1997, the day after Bebb-Jones had left for Las Vegas with his son Daniel. Before then, Bebb-Jones had taken his minivan for a clean, but police later found traces of his wife's blood inside. On September 21, Daniel was found alone in a hotel room and taken into care. His father was found the next day by a maid with a gunshot wound to the head, which was self-inflicted. Bebb-Jones returned to the UK with his son in 1998 and had refused to co-operate with US police. Sabrina's skull was found in 2004 near purple thistle flowers which had also been found underneath Bebb-Jones's van. This led to the start of extradition proceedings and today's sentencing, which brings a 16-year case to a close.","Marcus Bebb-Jones, 49, killed his wife Sabrina, then 31, in 1997 .

The mistress of a . father of 17 moved out of the family home with five of the couple's . children just a week before the tragic blaze. Friends and neighbours said yesterday that Lisa Willis left after Michael Philpott refused to divorce his wife and marry her. A separate five of his children, all born to wife Mairead and all under the age of ten, were killed when flames tore through the house in Derby as they slept. A 38-year-old man and woman aged in her 20s were earlier being held on suspicion of murder but tonight were . released without charge. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Mick and Mairead Philpott, pictured with five of the six children who died in the house fire. The other identities have been obscured for legal reasons . Complaint: Mr Philpott had previously demanded a bigger council house . Tragedy: The scene in Victory Road, Allenton, Derby, where five children died and two adults were taken to hospital this morning after a fire . It is thought that Miss Willis may now be pregnant with Mr Philpott’s 18th child. A . series of anguished Facebook postings over the last month reveal Mr . Philpott’s torment over the turbulent situation as he declared his love for all . his children. He had made a public appeal to be moved from the home where the blaze occurred to a . bigger property to accommodate his unusual and growing family. One friend, . who asked not to be named, said: ‘Lisa left and took the children with . her. I think she stopped Mick from seeing them at one point.’ The . five dead children were last night named as ten-year-old Jade, . John, aged nine, Jack, aged eight, six-year-old Jesse, and Jayden, who . turned five in February. Devastating fire: The exterior of Mick Philpott's home in Allenton, Derby . The 13-year-old survivor, Duwayne, who has been transferred to a burns unit in Birmingham, is understood to be Mrs Philpott's son from a previous relationship. Derbyshire Police said Mr and Mrs Philpott have asked for privacy during this difficult time as they continue to support the boy in hospital. Mr Philpott has four biological children with Miss Willis: Shareen, aged eight, Katrine, seven, Kirk, six and five-year-old Yawery. A fifth child, Jordan, 12, was Miss Willis’s from another relationship, but was raised by Mr Philpott and his then-mistress. Mr Philpott also has six more children: David, 25, Richard, 24, and Michaela, 21, with his first wife, Pamela Lomax; Mikey, 14, and Aidan, 13, with ex-girlfriend Heather Kehoe, and Joshua, five, who Mr Philpott once said was the product of a liaison with the partner of a friend. Mourning: Horrified neighbours have been laying flowers near the house since the fire and have set up a charity to help pay for the funerals . TV appearance: Mick Philpott on the Jeremy Kyle Show, where he talked about the 15 children he had at the time . Just days ago, Mr Philpott, one of nine siblings himself, wrote of missing his ‘beautiful babies’ as part of a string of Facebook postings professing his love for of his children. He wrote on May 1: ‘I love all my children more than life itself, including the ones who are not my flesh and blood.’ But less than an hour later, another comment apparently about Miss Willis laid bare the souring of relations between them. He wrote: ‘All I want is my wife and all my kids they mean more. I’m sorry things turned out like this for my family. Thank Christ I did not divorce Mairead and marry that.’ It is understood the couple parted in late January and had some sort of reconciliation in mid-April, before tensions grew again. Tribute: A friend of Mr Philpott said that the father 'loved all his children the same' The blaze broke out at the house in Allenton, Derby, at around 3.45am at the front of the 1960s semi. It is near the city’s giant Rolls Royce factory. Next-door neighbour Joe Peel, who alerted the emergency services, said he was woken by his dog barking and looked outside his window to see the Philpotts’ front door alight. He said: ‘I ran out of the house, screaming to the neighbour to wake him up. No one could get near the house because of flames and smoke. ‘Everyone was screaming. A couple of minutes later the fire brigade came down with the police. ‘Two or three minutes later you could see the flames going up the stairs through the side window of the house. When the fire brigade came it was billowing smoke going up the road – it was absolutely horrible’. Another neighbour, who didn’t want to be named, said: ‘It was terrible, just so bad. There was nothing anybody could do.’ It is understood Mr Philpott and his wife were downstairs asleep and were woken by the smoke alarm. Sympathies: Ann Widdecombe, who appeared with Mr Philpott in a TV show, said 'no one could call him a bad father' A neighbour said Mr Philpott was later seen trying to smash the conservatory window to get back in. Acting assistant chief constable Steve Cotterill, of Derbyshire Police, said the arrested woman was held elsewhere in the city. He said: ‘Our thoughts are with the . parents and the family of the children for their tragic loss and for the . community of Allenton, who would of course have known the children. 'I want to stress that we are keeping an open mind in terms of the investigation. The arrests are only one aspect of the inquiry. 'It is paramount that we have a thorough investigation of the scene before we determine the cause of the fire. 'People in the community have been very cooperative and I'm really appreciative for all the help and support we have had as we investigate this tragedy.' He said officers were working with the fire service to identify the cause of the blaze. Mr Cotterill said eight people were living in the house permanently, though there might be other people who stayed there from time to time. Neighbours in Allenton mourning the deaths of the five children have now set up a charity to help pay for their funerals. Bobby Sutherland, who has lived on the same estate all his life, was inspired to set up an online charity called Catch Me When I Fall because of the children. Mr Sutherland said: 'The original statement was about the kids. 'Everybody's got kids, everybody wants kids or everybody's had kids, so it affects everybody.' He said people should not judge Mr Philpott because 'he loved his kids', adding: 'You make mistakes but you don't deserve that. Nobody deserves that.' Blaze: Emergency services were called to the house on Victory Road in Allenton, Derby, just before 4am yesterday . A special church service was held this morning at St George's Roman Catholic Church, where Mr Philpott and his family were in the congregation. Dozens of floral tributes and messages were laid at their house throughout the day. In 2006, when Mr Philpott asked Derby city council for a bigger council home, the authority said nothing suitable was available. Mr Philpott then took part in a television show on ITV called Ann Widdecombe Versus The Benefits Culture. As part of the series, the MP spent a week with the Philpotts and found him a job, although he did not attend on his first day. Ms Widdecombe said of Mr Philpott: 'Nobody would ever call him a bad father. I'm so sorry to hear the news and my thoughts are with the family.' He has also appeared on the Jeremy Kyle show after being branded ‘Britain’s biggest scrounger’. Yesterday, the council refused to . comment on the case because of the police investigation, but a spokesman . offered the authority’s ‘deepest sympathy’ to the family over their . loss. Derbyshire Police said post-mortem exams will be carried out today to determine each of the children's cause of death. A Facebook advert and email account - appeals@derbyshire.pnn.police.uk - has been set up by the force to take information about the investigation.","Victims are Jade Philpott, 10, her brothers John, nine, and Jack, seven, and sisters Jessie, six and Jaden, five .

Sesame Street has aired an episode which deals with the sensitive issue of divorce for the first time. A scene on the issue had been originally written for the show in 1992 - but was a disaster when tested before an audience of pre-schoolers who misunderstood and became upset. The idea was shelved until this year - when writers came up with a slot featuring a fairy called Abby Cadabby whose parents have been divorced for a while. The 13-minute segment will be aired online today. Scroll down for video . Getting real: Today's episode of Sesame Street deals with the issue of divorce when fairy Abby Cadabby tells her friends that she has two houses - one where she lives with her mom and the other with her dad . Sensitive subjects: Abby shows drawings of her two homes on Tuesday's epsiode which deals with divorce for the first time ever . In the scene, Abby, a fun-loving pink fairy with sparkly hair, holds up two drawings of houses - one where she lives with her mommy and the other where she lives with daddy. When her friends Elmo and Rosita ask why Abby has two homes, the adult Gordon explains to the muppets that: 'Divorce means that Abby’s mommy and daddy aren’t married anymore.' Abby adds that their divorce used to make her 'sad and mad' but that things have become easier with time. The divorce rate in America is 50 per cent making it a common issue in young children's lives. Lewis Bernstein, VP of Sesame Street who has been with the show for 30 years, explained that from the very beginning, the team said that they would never talk down to children. Divorce was first broached by writers and researchers in 1992. One day on Sesame Street, the elephant character Snuffy tells Big Bird:'My dad is moving out of our cave...because of something called a divorce.' The scene was tested on pre-schoolers - to disastrous results. Children panicked and didn't know where Snuffy would live and fretted that their own parents would get a divorce and not love them. Brave decisions: In 2006, Bill Clinton appeared in a UNICEF public service announcement alongside Kami, an HIV-positive character from Takalani Sesame . This time around, seasoned Sesame Street writer Christine Ferraro told Time: 'Writing about divorce is not easy.  My approach was from the point of view of Abby whose parents have gone through a divorce in the past, so that it is not a new, raw emotion.' The 13-minute segment appears as part of a multimedia project by Sesame Workshop, the non-profit that operates Sesame Street. It also means that it is up to parents - depending on the family's circumstances at the time - whether they want their children to see the divorce scene. Current issues: A Sesame Street episode in which Big Bird loses his home in a hurricane was re-aired in the wake of Hurricane Sandy . The show has a history of courageously bringing up subjects that Mr Bernstein admits 'sometimes you think you wouldn't want to touch with a 10ft pole'. In 2002, Bill Clinton appeared in a UNICEF public service announcement alongside Kami, an HIV-positive character from Takalani Sesame - South Africa's version of the show. Other issues that have been covered include race, adoption, prison and death. An episode where Big Bird loses his home in a hurricane was re-aired in the weeks after Hurricane Sandy.",Online segment broadcast today where fairy Abby Cadabby tells her friends about living at both mom and dad's house .

Michigan authorities have released a sketch of the man suspected of snatching a young mother as she finished up her night shift at a gas station on Friday. Jessica Heeringa, 25, who has a three-year-old son, vanished 15 minutes from the end of her shift at an Exxon gas station in North Shores. Her car and purse were found left behind at the scene. The sketch of a wavy-haired man was based on an account given by a witness who saw a male drive away from the gas station - and police said they believe it will reinvigorate their investigation. Do you know this man? Police have released this sketch, left, of a man seen driving away from the gas station in Michigan where young mother Jessica Heeringa, right, was last seen on Friday night . 'With the sketch, now we are retracing some of our steps' Norton . Shores Police Chief Daniel Shaw told WZZM. 'We are taking the sketch out to some . of those individuals we've already talked to, and are showing them the . sketch. 'Someone knows this person. That is a very good drawing. Someone is going to know who that is.' Authorities have also released video, shot from the nearby Old Homestead Tavern, showing a minivan witnesses told police had been in the area around the same time that Heeringa went missing. Norton Shores Police Chief Dan Shaw admitted that the video leaves much to be desired in terms of hard-hitting evidence, . but they're hopeful that releasing it could help unlock the . mystery. Mystery: This bar surveillance video shows a Chrysler Town & Country minivan that is believed to have been at the gas station around the time of Jessica Heeringa's disappearance on Friday night . Chief Shaw told WOOD-TV: . 'I wish I had the technology like you see on TV where you can blow it . up and I can see the driver inside, but that doesn’t exist for me.' He told the station that the vehicle appears to match the Town & Country minivan seen by witnesses in the area prior to Ms Heeringa's disappearance. Authorities are now looking to question its driver, described as a 'heavyset' white male, between 30 and 40 years old. Police suspect that she may have been familiar with her abductor. 'There is no sign of a struggle in the store, so it's possible she knew who the person was as a customer or as an acquaintance,' Chief Shaw told ABCNews. Mystery: Heeringa has a three-year-old son, who family members said she would never leave behind . Authorities were alerted on Friday night when a worried customer called about the unattended gas station at 11:15pm. That customer, Craig Harpster, said he came to the gas station like he normally does after work, and noticed that no one was there. After looking around and finding no one, he told WOOD-TV that he had a 'gut feeling that something bad had happened' and called police. Mr Harpster's 911 call was also released by authorities over the weekend. In the call, he tells the dispatcher: . 'There's nobody here. Um... it wouldn't allow me to pump gas. I just . walked inside, there's nobody. There's a car here. There's another car . out front. But it's just very suspicious why there's nobody here.' Workplace: The Exxon Mobil gas station in Norton Shores, Michigan - from where Heeringa was snatched . Ms Heeringa made her last sale at 11pm. The missing woman's family made a . heartfelt plea for information on Sunday as police reclassified her . disappearance as an abduction. In . a press conference on Sunday morning, Chief Shaw said officers were . treating the case as abduction after examining evidence at the scene. No money was stolen from the gas station and it appeared that Ms Heeringa had left cleaning supplies on the counter. Police described Heeringa as a white female, 5'1 tall, approximately 110 lbs., with blonde shoulder length hair, and blue eyes. Vigil: A friend hugs Shelly Heeringa, Jessica's mother, during a vigil at Pointes Mall in Norton Shores . Plea: Shelly Heeringa attended the vigil for her daughter on Tuesday as police released the sketch . Jessica is also known to wear wire rim glasses. She may be wearing a blue collared shirt saying 'Sternberg Exxon.' The gas station has no surveillance cameras so police are relying on public information for help in the investigation. 'I'm sure she was abducted,' Ms Heeringa's mother told Michigan Live. '[There was] no struggle. She was cleaning a machine, she left her car keys, [and] no money was taken from the gas station.' The . anguished family were praying for Jessica's safe return. 'She's loved . by everyone,' her mother said. 'She has a 3-year-old boy who is missing . his mom and wants her back.' Missed: Heeringa was allegedly abducted at about 11pm on Friday from the gas station . Hope: Liz Lunsford of Muskegon releases balloons across the street from the Exxon Mobil gas station . Derek Antol, a regular customer at the station, told Michigan Live, that he was 'dumbfounded' by the incident. 'I didn't know her, I didn't even know her name until this,' Antol said. 'But she was always very sweet, friendly gal.' Antol said he is offering a reward of $500 for tips that lead to an arrest. 'I would hope if it was my kid people would show up here to support me,' he added. 'I am very surprised that people aren't here.'","Jessica Heeringa vanished from an Exxon gas station in Michigan on Friday just 15 minutes before the end of her shift .

Brighton PDSA senior vet, Becca Thring, said: 'This was a life-or-death situation - without surgery, it is highly likely that Pax would have died. As with all major operations, there are risks, but it was the only option.' Emergency surgery meant the tennis ball was removed intact and the clumsy canine was allowed home the same day.

These days Michael Barrymore is Michael Parker, garden centre worker. The 60-year-old – once one of Britain’s top entertainers – has reverted to using his real name and helps out stacking shelves and shifting sacks of compost. Career change: Disgraced TV star Michael Barrymore has been found working for free in a garden centre in Essex . Dirty work: The former TV host has shown he's not afraid of getting his hands dirty as he works at the centre in Brentwood . He said: ‘I don’t get paid for it. I help out because I enjoy gardening. People come over and wish me well. Sometimes I walk around with them to show them the plants.’ The former TV star, who works three days a week at Tomlins  in Brentwood, Essex, added:  ‘I stack the shelves and often I’m wheeling around heavy sacks  of compost.’ Barrymore’s programmes, including Strike It Lucky and My Kind Of People, were watched weekly by millions in the Eighties and Nineties. But his star crashed to earth in 2001, when the body of Stuart Lubbock, 31, was found in his swimming pool during a party. The day after his death, Barrymore checked into the Marchwood Priory in Southampton, commonly used by celebrities with addictions and depression. Flower arranger: Barrymore told shoppers he has started working at the store because 'I enjoy gardening' Before and after: As the star has been found . stacking shelves, left, it marks a much less glamorous career since his . heyday as a host on Strike It Lucky, right . A police investigation led to no charges and an inquest recorded an open verdict, but Barrymore never recovered from the affair and in 2003 he was axed by ITV. In May 2004 he filed for bankruptcy after receiving a ‘surprise’ tax bill, reported to be in the region of £1.4million. The entertainer, who once signed a £2million deal with ITV, recently said that he finally dropped his stage persona after an unsuccessful comeback attempt when he appeared on Celebrity Big Brother in 2006. The recovering alcoholic has since admitted he came close to taking his own life. Easy work: Michael looks more relaxed than he has in over a decade as he undertakes his new role as a garden centre assistant . Signing for the fans: The comic was in a jovial mood during a recent night out with friends . He said: ‘My real name is Michael Parker – Michael Barrymore is dead. Although I have been a couple of times to the jumping-off point, I didn’t kill myself. If I had, it would have completed the story. ‘I don’t have to do what I’ve been doing since I was eight, which is making people laugh to deflect things. It’s the first time I’ve ever got to know me.’ He blamed ‘a conspiracy’ for destroying his TV career and spoke of his regrets over the way he treated his wife Cheryl following his decision to come out as homosexual in 1995. He said: ‘I never shy away from the fact that I’m an alcoholic and that I have had my problems, but I’ve never murdered anybody. I’ve never got up in the morning and thought I’ll harm someone. I’ve just had an extraordinary sequence of events that have been on public display that I’ve had no control over.’ In 2009 it emerged that Barrymore was working as an odd-job man in an Essex garage.","Barrymore works at the garden centre in Brentwood, Essex for free .

Nelson Mandela's grand-daughters have been accused of cashing in on his fame by appearing in a reality TV show. But the two sisters, both their 30s, insist that their family trust them to do what they want, provided they act with 'respect and integrity'. Being Mandela, a 13-part series following the lives of fashionable Zaziwe Dlamini-Manaway and Swati Dlamini in Johannesburg, premiers on Sunday. Famous name: Swati Dlamini, left, and Zaziwe Dlamini-Manaway, will star in reality show 'Being Mandela' In it, the sisters bicker, gossip and cope with the usual family disputes - but their ancestry sets them apart from the typical reality TV star. While the 94-year-old former South African president does not appear in the show, his ex-wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela - 'Big Mommy' to her grandchildren - has a central role. Swati Dlamini said: 'We get asked this . question a lot. Is this not going to tarnish the name and is this not . going to be bad for the name?' Daily life: Swati, left, and Zaziwe insist their grandfather is a fan of reality TV including Toddlers and Tiaras . 'But our grandparents have always said to . us, this is our name too, and we can do what we think is best fitting . with the name, as long as we treat it with respect and integrity.' Mandela, who the girls know as their strict 'Big Grandpa', was recently treated for a lung infection and had surgery to remove gallstones. The sisters say their grandfather, who they only really got to know after he retired from public life, is now 'happy and healthy.' The show, made by COZI TV for NBC, contains various revelations about Mandela, who his grand-daughters say sees himself as 'belonging to his country'. 'Our grandfather always told us that he . belongs to the country and he's of service to the country and he doesn't . belong to us as a family,' said Swati. 'And that's the sacrifice he's made for the . country and that what he's told us as far as I can remember.' They insist the Nobel Peace Prize winner is a fan of reality television and will watch the show. 'You'll be interested to know that he . loves Toddlers and Tiaras,' added Swati, in reference to the . series about child beauty pageants. At home: The sisters share a recent photo of Nelson Mandela, 95, with his great grandson Zen Manaway, one . 'Because of the kids,' added Zaziwe, 35, who has three children with her husband, an American businessman. 'He just loves children.' She shows the cameras a photograph of . Mandela at home last week, flashing his familiar smile, with his youngest . great-grandchild on his lap - her one-year-old son. The picture is a . rare public image of Mandela, whose last appearance on a major stage . was during the 2010 World Cup soccer tournament in South Africa. The sisters, who spent most of their childhood in exile in the United States, make an emotional visit to the prison on Robben Island where their grandfather spent 18 of the 27 years he was imprisoned by South Africa's white-ruled government. Controversial: While Mandela does not appear in the show, ex-wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela features heavily . Swati, who has a four-year-old daughter, works on publishing the prison diaries that her grandmother wrote but now cannot bear to read. Swati, whose full name is Zamaswazi, was smuggled on to Robben Island in 1980, when she was less than a year old, wrapped in blankets her grandmother pretended she needed as protection against the cold. Let in on the secret, prison guard Christo Brand recalls initially refusing to allow Mandela to see his grandchild, according to his memoir at the Nelson Mandela Centre of Memory. Brand says he eventually gave in, though he feared he might lose his job. 'I gave him the baby, he had tears in his eyes while he held her,' he said. 'Mandela never told anyone about this. When we walked back to the prison section, he told me how important the moment was, to touch something small.' The sisters, along with two brothers, are the latest famous names to launch a fashion line, called 'Long Walk to Freedom' in honour of their grandfather's autobiography. Their hope is that U.S. audiences will see a vibrant and modern side of South Africa through their eyes. Mandela, who always lamented his long separation from his family during his imprisonment, is happiest these days when his offspring are running around being loud, his granddaughters say. 'We're in and out of the house. We're loud and he loves the noise,' Zaziwe said. The sisters are the daughters of Zenani Mandela and Prince Thumbumuzi Dlamini of Swaziland. They say their grandfather - a symbol of integrity and magnanimity across the world - holds the family to high standards and sets rules for when the children should be home and when dinner should start. 'He's a very strict person,' said Zaziwe. Most people wouldn't think that but he really, really is,' The sisters are closer to grandmother, who divorced Mandela in 1997. Their adoring description of their grandmother as the doting matriarch contrasts sharply with her chequered public image. Mrs Madikizela-Mandela faces accusations, which she denies, that she and her bodyguard unit committed 18 killings in the 1980s. 'She's fun,' added Zaziwe. 'She never says no to us. I don't think I've ever heard my grandmother say no to us.' The series shows 'Big Mommy' clearly taking charge of the family - marching into the hospital room where Zaziwe gave birth to Zen with a list of possible names for the boy.","Sisters appear in Being Mandela, which follows their lives in Johannesburg .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 22:16 EST, 2 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:29 EST, 3 July 2013 . Pope John Paul II has cleared the final obstacle before being made a saint, awaiting just the final approval from Pope Francis and a date for the ceremony that could come as soon as December 8, a Vatican official and news reports said Tuesday.The ANSA news agency reported that a commission of cardinals and bishops met Tuesday to consider John Paul's case and signed off on it. A Vatican official confirmed that the decision had been taken some time back and that Tuesday's meeting was essentially a formality.One possible canonization date is December 8, the feast of the Immaculate Conception, a major feast day for the Catholic Church. This year the feast coincidentally falls on a Sunday, which is when canonizations usually occur. Sainthood imminent: Pope John Paul II, seen here releasing doves from the window of his apartments in Vatican City in 2005, will be made a saint as soon as December . Controversial: Some of the Vatican's problems, including sex abuse cover-ups and financial scandals, date from the time of Pope John Paul II, leading to questions about his fitness for a sainthood . The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized by the church to discuss saint-making cases on the record, confirmed reports in La Stampa newspaper that Pope John Paul II could be canonized together with Pope John XXIII, who called the Second Vatican Council but died in 1963 before it was finished. There is reasoned precedent for beatifying or canonizing two popes together, primarily to balance one another out. John Paul II has been on the fast track for possible sainthood ever since his 2005 death, but there remains some concern that the process has been too quick. Some of the Holy See's deep-seated problems - clerical sex abuse, dysfunctional governance and more recently the financial scandals at the Vatican bank - essentially date from shortcomings of his pontificate. All saints: Pope John Paul II and Mother Teresa, who was beatified in 2003, together in Calcutta in 1987 . Defenders of the fast-track process argue that people are canonized, not pontificates.But the Vatican in the past has sought to balance concerns about papal saints by giving two the honor at the same time. Such was the case in 2000, when John Paul beatified John XXIII, dubbed the 'good pope,' alongside Pope Pius IX, who was criticized by Jews for condoning the seizure of a Jewish boy and allegedly referring to Jews as dogs.By canonizing John Paul II along with John XXIII, the Vatican could be seeking to assuage concerns about John Paul's fast-track sainthood case by tying it together with the 50-year wait John XXIII has had to endure. Spiritual leaders: Pope John Paul II in 1986 in New Delhi with the Dalai Lama . Rites: Pope John Paul II gives communion to a Zairean woman in 1985 . Former leader of the Catholic Church: Karol Józef Wojtyła was born in Poland and became Pope John Paul II at the age of 50, in 1978 . Many Poles have been awaiting the final steps of John Paul's progress, which has been pushed for by Cardinal Stanislaw Dziwisz, the Polish pope's longtime private secretary.'We should be very happy if it is confirmed,' Dziwisz's spokesman, the Reverend Robert Necek told Polish TVN24 television. 'This is the next and the last step towards canonization. It will be presented to Pope Francis and the pope will take the appropriate decision.'During John Paul's 2005 funeral Mass, chants of 'Santo Subito!' or 'Sainthood Now!' erupted in St. Peter's Square. Heeding the calls, then-Pope Benedict XVI waived the typical five-year waiting period and allowed an investigation into John Paul's life to begin immediately. The investigation determined that the beloved Polish-born pope lived a virtuous life, the first step in the sainthood process.Subsequently, the Vatican determined that a French nun who prayed for his intercession was miraculously cured of Parkinson's disease. A second miracle is needed for canonization. The Vatican hasn't divulged any details about that second purported miracle.","A meeting of cardinals and bishops has signed off on the sainthood of Pope John Paul II, whose tenure as Pope ended with his death in 2005 .
The last step is the final approval of Pope Francis and a date for the ceremony which could be as soon as December 8 .
Two miracles must be performed to rate a sainthood: the first of Pope John Paul II was the curing of a nun of Parkinson's disease after she prayed for his intercession; his second has not been revealed as yet ."

A bike enthusiast has been dubbed the 'eco rider' after building an electric version of a classic motorcycle. Nigel Bryant has created a stretched bike that can be propelled by a 36 volt battery-powered motor or by pedal-power. The 56-year-old chopper motorbike fan wanted a custom-made version of the bike immortalised in the cult 1969 film Easy Rider, and he wanted it to be inexpensive and eco-friendly. Scroll down for video . Nigel Bryant has been dubbed the 'eco rider' after building an electric version of a classic motorcycle . The bike operates like a normal bicycle but it also has a 36 volt battery-powered motor. The motor allows it to travel at a top speed of 20mph but the battery needs recharging every 30 minutes. It can be powered solely by pedalling, just using the motor, or using a combination of the two. It is virtually silent, emission free and very cheap to run. So, he spent £1,000 making the 6ft 5ins long bike that features 3.5ft long elongated front forks and handlebars to give it a recumbent appearance. However, 'road trips' on the bike are limited as it has a top speed of 20mph and can only run for 30 miles before the battery needs recharging or pedal-power has to be employed. Mr Bryant, from Poole, Dorset, set about making the bike after he was made redundant from his job as a university scientific support officer and found himself with time on his hands. He created by the bespoke frame with help from a firm that specialises in metal tubing. He then purchased an old Stringray chopper bicycle from eBay and dismantled it so he could use some of the parts. He paid for the elongated front forks to be shipped over from America and attached the lithium battery which is hidden in one of the panniers.

They see me rollin: Nigel's green 'Chopper' can reach a maximum 20mph as he speeds down the streets . The blue bike, which was built in Mr Bryant’s workshop at his home, is virtually silent, emission free and far cheaper to run than any normal motorbike. Maybe that is why he often gets thumbs-up signs, and comments like 'cool bike', whenever he rides the machine through the streets of Poole. Mr Bryant said: ‘I have been building custom motorbikes for years but with petrol becoming ever more expensive, an eco-friendly means of transport made perfect sense. ‘Also, everything these days needs to be tested and if you build a custom motorbike from scratch it needs to be inspected and insured but you can make a bicycle how you want to. He spent £1,000 making the 6ft 5ins long bike that features 3.5ft long elongated front forks and handlebars. His partner, Linda, is pictured finishing the frame . 'Road trips' on the bike are limited as it has a top speed of 20mph and can only run for 30 miles before the battery (pictured in a saddle bag) needs recharging . ‘I wanted to make a version of a chopper as I have always loved them, so to customise a bicycle in this way seemed like the best of both worlds.’ He added: ‘You can use the bike in three ways; operate it completely by pedalling, use the auto-pedalling feature that kicks in the motor or use the thumb throttle. ‘As it relies on a battery it is absolutely quiet and there are no emissions. ‘People often point it out when I'm riding it and some say I must have long legs or that it looks hard to ride, but that's far from the truth.’ Happy Chopper: Nigel's bike is modelled on a classic Chopper motorbike, such as this one, but is much kinder to the environment (file photo) He purchased an old Stringray chopper bicycle from eBay and dismantled it so he could use some of the parts .

'The Spanish, who are a pretty fun-loving group, have banned them in recent years as well because of the impact on livestock, on crops and indeed property and potentially the threat to life.'

'I don't think governments should be knee-jerk in outlawing things but, if you look back, I have been doing this for some time alongside others, like the NFU. 'I think the majority of MPs have perhaps only become aware of this recently because the majority of MPs don't represent rural constituencies where this is deemed to be a bigger threat.' Downing Street played down calls for a ban. 'The actual number of fires caused by Chinese lanterns is very small,' a No 10 spokesman said.

Nigel Evans dressed up and taking part in the Parliamentary Palace of Varieties in Aid of Macmillan Cancer Relief . Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans has been Tory MP for the Ribble Valley for more than 20 years. Born and raised in Swansea, he stayed in the Welsh city for his university years and gained a BA Hons in politics. Following his arrest last night for alleged sexual offences against two men in their 20s, colleagues have come out in support of the Deputy Speaker. Brian Binley, Tory MP for Northampton South and a friend of Evans, said: 'I was just deeply disturbed and shocked. 'I've known him ever since I've been in Parliament and I came in in 2005. I consider him to be a very good friend. I know him to be caring, compassionate and in no way would he inflict himself violently on any other person. 'He is a good enough friend to have come up last Friday to a fundraiser my partner Sally and I were holding for Macmillan nurses and so I do know him well. 'I just hope and pray that this thing is cleared up sooner rather than later.' Having joined the Conservative Party as a 17-year-old, Mr Evans became a councillor on West Glamorgan County Council from 1985 to 1991, and was elected deputy Conservative group leader in 1990. He contested Swansea in the 1987 general election, Pontypridd in the 1989 by-election and then the Ribble Valley in the 1991 by-election, before being elected MP for the Lancashire constituency the following year. Mr Evans' kept his links to his home city however and owned family convenience store Evans the News in Townhill, set up by his grandfather in the 1930s, until he sold it last year. He was parliamentary private secretary to several cabinet members in the 1990s, including then employment secretary David (now Lord) Hunt, agriculture minister Tony Baldry and to William Hague when he was secretary of state for Wales. In June 1997, he was appointed opposition front bench spokesman for Welsh affairs and he went on to lead the Conservative Party's general election campaign in Wales three years later. Mr Evans can be seen here performing alongside Lembit Opik MP,  MP and Stephen Pound MP during the Macmillan Cancer Support's House of Lords and House of Commons . Parliamentary Palace of Varieties . Iain Duncan-Smith gave Mr Evans the . position of shadow secretary of state for Wales in 2001, which he held . for two years, and he was appointed to the Welsh Affairs Select . Committee in 2003. He was vice-chairman of the Conservative Party from . 2004 to 2005. A popular figure at Westminster, in June 2010 Mr Evans was elected as one of the three Commons deputy speakers. Later that year, he revealed he was gay, saying that he was 'tired of living a lie'. He . came out on the eve of the launch of a new help group for politicians . and Westminster staff, ParliOut, in which he was involved. At the time, Mr Evans claimed a Labour MP had threatened to 'out' him and that he had decided to be open about his sexuality to help others in a similar position. He had discussed the issue with Gareth Thomas, the former Welsh rugby international who had been married before coming out as gay, and said he realised it 'should be no big deal' for him to do the same. Mr Evans said he had been 'confused' about how to protect pupils when he backed the Tories' notorious Section 28 legislation in the 1980s however and later regretted that support. Welsh political commentator Gareth Hughes . described Mr Evans as a highly respected individual among his party . colleagues, who loved returning to Swansea but was 'not a great lover of . devolution' As well as keeping his grandfather's shop, Mr Evans was said to be 'fond of coming home' to Wales. The former Swansea councillor highlighted his concerns over Clostridium difficile following the death of his mother Betty at Singleton Hospital. And last week he attended a Welsh Conservative party conference at the Liberty Stadium. Welsh political commentator Gareth Hughes described Mr Evans as a highly respected individual among his party colleagues, who loved returning to Swansea but was 'not a great lover of devolution'. Mr Evans has a personal interest in American politics and worked on three US presidential campaigns in the 1980s. He returned to the US in 2000, acting as British Conservative Party parliamentary observer. In the Debrett's People of Today profile on Mr Evans, he lists he recreations as 'tennis, swimming, all spectator sports'. Born in Swansea in 1957, Mr Evans was educated at Dynevor School, a grammar which converted to a comprehensive during his time there. After studying for a politics degree at Swansea University, Mr Evans started his working life helping out at his family’s newsagents shops, before embarking on his political career as a local councillor. He was defeated in three Commons Elections in the space of one Parliamentary term – Swansea West at the 1987 General Election, at the Pontypridd by-election in 1989 and the Ribble Valley by-election in 1991 – before finally taking his current seat at the 1992 Election. ‘After decades of denying it to myself, . and then just denying it to others, I didn’t want to continue living a . fraction of my life.’ Nigel Evans MP . He was quickly talent-spotted by William Hague who made him his Parliamentary Private Secretary in 1996, when Mr Hague was Welsh Secretary. Mr Evans was briefly a party frontbencher when he served as Shadow Welsh Secretary under Iain Duncan Smith between 2001 and 2003, returning to the backbenches after Michael Howard took over the Tory leadership. Since becoming Deputy Speaker, after the 2010 Election, he has impressed colleagues with his handling of Commons debates: his good-humoured approach is preferred by many MPs to John Bercow’s more abrasive style. Some said Mr Evans was in prime position to succeed Mr Bercow when he stands down. Master of ceremonies: Deputy speaker Nigel Evans dressed as a ringmaster while hosting a Commons reception for the circus industry . Last month, Mr Evans made clear his respect for Margaret Thatcher by mounting a strong defence of the cost of the funeral arrangements for the former Prime Minister. He rebuked the Bishop of Grantham for suggesting the event could be a focus for ugly protests, insisting Britain excelled at ‘pomp and ceremony’. He also heaped praise on Lady Thatcher’s granddaughter Amanda for her calm and collected reading at the funeral in St Paul’s. Mr Evans said: ‘If she had been speaking at just a family funeral people can break down and cry, but her composure was perfect.’ Mr Evans told movingly in 2009 how his mother Betty died from a superbug infection after a routine operation in an NHS hospital, writing: ‘The last, harrowing moments of my mother’s life will live for ever in the collective memory of my family. 'An 86-year-old lady of infinite grace and dignity, she had the most agonising of deaths.’ He blamed the tragedy on a ‘mixture of neglect, incompetence and indifference shown by the NHS’ before adding: ‘If she had been cared for properly, if the ward had been cleaner or greater urgency had been shown in handling her case, then this tragedy might never have happened.’ Mr Evans – who enjoys regular foreign trips as part of his duties – made a characteristic appearance in the gossip columns two years ago when involved in a good-humoured, late-night exchange with police after pulling up to the Commons gates in a tourist rickshaw. He made a futile attempt to persuade them to waive security rules so he could ride on to the  Parliamentary estate to collect the driver’s fare. He was last spotted at the Commons on Thursday evening, cheerfully waving to colleagues as he loaded up his Saab convertible before driving to his constituency.

One of Britain's most popular theme parks has been accused of distracting customers and 'switching balls' to manipulate the number of prizes won at its games stalls. Staff at Thorpe Park in Chertsey, Surrey, have also been accused of using wax to increase friction on surfaces, after an undercover investigation. It is said they were actively encouraged to try to make a certain amount of money before each prize was given out. Staff at Thorpe Park in Chertsey, Surrey, have been accused of manipulating rides to make them more difficult, after an undercover investigation . The allegations, made after a BBC investigation, have been 'utterly refuted' by the company behind the rides. It is claimed that wax was used to make it harder for players to knock over blocks, and stall holders were said to have given customers a different type of ball to the one they were originally shown. The staff are employed by HB Leisure Ltd. The company manages the stalls at Thorpe Park, Alton Towers, Legoland and Chessington World of Adventures. An HB Leisure senior manager was caught on camera admitting that employees were 'increasing the difficulty level' for some customers. The investigation was carried out by new BBC One consumer show Your Money Their Tricks. A spokeswoman for Thorpe Park said: 'We would never condone any activity on the park which was proven to mislead or in any way disadvantage our guests.' She added:  'Given these games are operated by third party suppliers - as the programme makes clear - as soon as we were made aware of the allegations... we contacted them and began our own extensive investigation. 'This investigation is ongoing but if we find any evidence of malpractice we will take swift and appropriate action against both any individuals concerned and the supplier company.' A spokesman at the popular park said it was investigating the allegations, whereas HB Leisure Ltd, the company which manages the stalls refuted the claims . Alex Sparks, managing director of HB Leisure, denied that its games were unfair and criticised the investigation for presenting 'rare and now remedied incidences' as regular practice. He said: 'We utterly refute any suggestions that any of our games are not fair and we had provided detailed information, explanations and evidence to the programme, in advance, to prove this. 'But the BBC decided to ignore much of this information and has therefore presented a biased and incorrect view of the games. 'It is totally untrue to say that games are manipulated to make people lose. The programme itself states that there are times when we make the games easier but presents this as a bad thing, which we - and we believe, our customers - can only see as a benefit.' Mr Sparks said that HB Leisure had given out more than 100,000 prizes at Thorpe Park, which 'in retail value is 50-60 per cent of the money spent by the customers who play the games.' He insisted that the company had provided 'detailed responses' to all the claims made by the BBC. 'We found that in almost all instances the programme had fundamentally misunderstood how the games worked and so we were able to explain and answer their queries in great detail,' he said. 'The rare instances where staff behaviour or games fell below standard were immediately checked and remedied.' Your Money Their Tricks will be broadcast tonight on BBC One at 8pm.","Workers accused of distracting customers and 'switching balls'

Hartley, a convicted sex attacker, was caught after boasting about how he was on the run from police to two boys . Two 12-year-old boys helped snare an attempted rapist on the run from police after he bragged to the pair of his fugitive status. Officers finally cornered Michael Hartley, 24, in Edgbaston, Birmingham, after being alerted to him by the pair who had spoken to him outside a nearby youth centre. Hartley was on West Midlands Police's 'Most Wanted' list for breaking the strict terms of his release after he was freed from a six-year sentence at HMP Birmingham on April 10 this year. Police had raided several addresses in the West Midlands in an effort to track him down, but finally arrested him on April 20 after the boys pointed him out. Speaking to the boys in the street outside the youth centre they attend, the sex attacker had boasted to them that he was one of the most wanted criminals in the region - which the quick-thinking youngsters checked online once he had left them. Realising he was a wanted man, the schoolboys alerted two passing police officers when they spotted Hartley in a nearby park later the same day. In a desperate bid to escape justice, Hartley jumped into a reservoir but, realising he was surrounded, he gave himself up and was eventually arrested while knee-deep in water. The two boys are now in line for a bravery award from West Midlands Police. Today one said he felt it was 'rude and nasty' to let an attempted rapist walk the streets. The boy, who does not want to be named, said: 'He seemed like a nice guy at first. 'But when we saw him again in the park and he was trying to call us over again, we saw the police and said ""there's a sex attacker in the park"". 'They didn't believe us until we showed them his picture on the police website on my phone. 'I'm not going to let an attempted rapist walk the streets, that's just rude, it's nasty. 'We did the right thing, I'm happy he's in prison.' Water fool: In a desperate bid to escape justice, Hartley jumped into Edgbaston Reservoir but, realising he was surrounded, he gave himself up and was eventually arrested while knee-deep in water . The other boy said his mother had already warned him that Hartley was on the loose after police told locals to keep an eye out for the fugitive. 'My mum said if we saw him to just run but we saw police,' he said. 'I would do it again because he's a danger to the public.' Superintendent Joanna Smallwood, from West Midlands Police, paid tribute to the heroic youngsters. She said: 'Thanks to the fantastic efforts of these two boys, we have arrested a man who was wanted by us for recall to prison. 'It is testament to them that they sought out the nearest police officer, told him their story and gave an excellent descripton of the man so we were able to find him quickly.' Chris Hoare, leader of the Safe Haven youth club the boys attend in Edgbaston, added: 'Without Safe Haven and the involvement with the police this would never have happened in a million years. 'Because they knew the officers they were able to approach them. 'It's just brilliant. We're all so proud of them.' Boasts: The street where Hartley spoke to the two boys that reported him to the police. Realising he was a wanted man, the boys alerted police officers when they spotted Hartley in a nearby park later the same day . Hartley, from Coventry, West Midlands, was jailed for six years in 2008 for trying to rape a woman in an alleyway when he was 19-years-old. He followed his 20-year-old victim as she walked home in Coventry at 2am on December 1, 2006, hid in an alleyway then grabbed her from behind as she walked past. He only stopped his attack and ran when a nearby resident shouted at him after hearing the woman's screams. Speaking after he was jailed in 2008, the victim said: 'The incident affected me in every way possible personality-wise. 'I lost my confidence, I've had mental health problems.'","Michael Hartley, 24, was wanted for breaking the terms of his parole .

"By . Mark Duell . PUBLISHED: . 13:22 EST, 2 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:49 EST, 3 July 2013 . This parish church’s iconic Victorian clock has been used by locals to set their watches since 1871. But the time is now 5:20 all day long at the picturesque St Michael and All Angels Church in Haworth, West Yorkshire, due to a health and safety ban that has been imposed on winding the clock. Retired policeman Jens Hislop has climbed the steps of the church several times a week for 23 years to set the clock - which has been ticking since 1863 and is older than most of the church. Not moving: Haworth vicar, the Reverend Peter Mayo-Smith, is pictured outside St Michael and All Angels Church, where a health and safety ban has been imposed on winding the Victorian clock . But an insurance inspection declared that Mr Hislop’s stepladder and winding platform - which have been at the church for decades - were unsafe, and the clock has been stuck at 5:20 since February. Mr Hislop, 73, who has branded the ban ‘barmy and crazy’, cannot touch the clock again until £1,000 of safety work on the joinery has been carried out - which will be mainly paid for by worshippers. He said yesterday: ‘I have been looking after the clock for 23 years and it has gone like clockwork. Then we had an insurance assessment and now health and safety has kicked in. ‘They say the platform, which has been there for decades, and the ladder, which was there when I started 23 years ago and was there before, are unsafe. ‘I personally don’t think it is unsafe. But they say it’s dangerous. The clock is in perfect working order but has been stopped since February. It is crazy. ‘The platform is only 10ft off the floor and the wooden step ladder was here when I started 23 years ago and is no different now to what it was then.’ Work needed: Church officials said the ladder - pictured with Reverend Mayo-Smith - is beyond its sell-by date . The clock mechanism runs down in eight days if not kept fully wound. Mr Hislop normally visited two to three times every week to maintain it. ‘I am perfectly willing to do it but I am not allowed to. It is health and safety gone barmy,’ he said. 'The platform is only 10ft off the floor and the wooden step ladder was here when I started 23 years ago and is no different now to what it was then' Jens Hislop, clock winder . Mr Hislop, who is also the church archivist, added: ‘I am not aware there has been an accident in the tower since it was built in 1871.  If there had been I would have been aware of it. ‘You could argue the church itself is more dangerous. You could bang your head on a pew or slip on the chancellery steps. 'Where do you draw the line? It is not the fault of the church people who are my friends. They have to do what health and safety dictates.’ Mr Hislop and his two assistants wind the clock by going up the tower by a spiral staircase to the first floor, where the bell chamber is located. No winding allowed: But an insurance inspection declared that the stepladder and winding platform - which have been at the church for decades - were unsafe, and the clock has been stuck at 5:20 since February . He then places his step ladder on the floor of the bell chamber and climbs up to the wooden winding platform with his crank handle to wind the chimes and the mechanism. 'I have had tourists commenting on it and people in the street who keep looking up at it. So the quicker we can get it running, the happier I will be. It has just taken a lot longer than we thought' Reverend Peter Mayo-Smith . But church officials said the ladder is beyond its sell-by date. The other problem is that they have been advised the bannisters are worn out and need replacing and building up to the right height. The bannister height needs to be 3ft 7in - but at the moment is only 2ft 4in. A second rail is also needed to stop people slipping through gaps, the assessors said. The lower part of the church tower dates back four centuries to when Patrick Bronte, father of the famous Bronte sisters, had his living in Haworth. The upper tower - where the clock is - and the rest of the church were rebuilt in 1871, but still contain Bronte relics and are popular with Bronte fans all over the world. Development: The upper tower (right) and the rest of the church were rebuilt in 1871, but still contain Bronte relics.

'We would not want anybody seriously hurt while doing something for the benefit of the church and village' John Huxley, Parish Council Chairman . ‘So the quicker we can get it running, the happier I will be. It has just taken a lot longer than we thought.’ Haworth, Cross Roads and Stanbury Parish Council chairman John Huxley said: ‘We had an insurance assessment and they said the tower did not meet health and safety requirements for the clock winder. ‘We were told the clock winder would have to stop until we had completed the safety work. We were asked to do the work by the insurers so we have to do it. ‘We would not want anybody seriously hurt while doing something for the benefit of the church and village.’","Time is 5:20 at St Michael and All Angels Church in West Yorkshire .

A Colorado real estate mogul has been cleared of first-degree rape charges stemming from his February encounter with a Citibank vice president inside the posh Standard Hotel in New York City. During a hearing Friday, Assistant District Attorney Alexandra Murphy announced that the alleged victim decided not to purpose the case, and that it is unclear whether Keith Hartigan had committed any crime. The prosecutor added that an investigation into the allegations showed that 'there are no probable criminal charges, the New York Post reported.' Hartigan, who sells and rents . high-end homes to Hollywood stars and recording artists in the ski . resort of Aspen, Colorado, was arrested at around 4.30am February 1 on suspicion . of first-degree rape. The Post reported at the time that he met the 31-year-old banker after his friend cozied up to her at 675 Bar in the city. She and his friend then joined Hartigan on the ninth floor of the trendy Meatpacking District hotel, where rooms cost as much as $1,700 a night, before falling asleep. The woman claimed to have been woken by the strapping property magnate as he allegedly groped . her, ripped off her underwear and then raped her before she managed to . flee and call 911. Hartigan was arrested and released after posting $7,500 bail. The 37-year-old real estate broker to the stars chose not to make an appearance in Manhattan Criminal Court Friday. His attorney, Edward Sapone, said that both surveillance video from the high-end hotel and interviews with witnesses show that his client's encounter with the 31-year-old Citibank employee was consensual and did involve any wrongdoing. 'Sometimes people engage in conduct that they unfortunately regret,' the attorney said in reference to the false allegations against his client. Police were called to the Standard Hotel in New York, pictured, on Friday after the 31-year-old woman claimed to have been raped . Sapone went on to tell the New York Daily News that . while the ordeal has taken a heavy financial and emotional toll on his . client, he does not intend to file a lawsuit against his accuser for . making the false claim. 'He just wants to get on with his life, he's not looking for retribution,' Sapone said. If the case were to go forward and the 37-year-old man was convicted, he could have faced up to 25 years in prison. Hartigan owns View West Properties, which sells luxury property in the exclusive ski resort of Aspen. While the company's website has been taken offline, its .

Eight out of ten Britons say they want a referendum on Europe as turmoil on the continent puts pressure on politicians to hold a vote on the matter . A new Populus poll found half the population want an immediate say about whether or not Britain should retain European membership status, with 40 per cent of those questioned saying they thought the country should pull out of Europe straight away. The survey, commissioned by The Times  found that only 18 per cent of people thought there was no need for a referendum in the foreseeable future. However, the poll also found there was considerable uncertainty among voters with nearly three out of ten (27 per cent) saying they ‘didn’t know’ if the UK should be 'part of the single market in a wider European Community'. When asked whether Britain should remain in the EU, keeping open the option of joining a more integrated Eurozone, 44 per cent disagreed, with 36 per cent saying yes and remainder (19 per cent) saying they 'didn’t know'. The Government has played down suggestions that an announcement of a referendum could come as early as this autumn at the party conference. While European markets reacted positively this morning to the news that eurozone leaders had agreed to loan Spain up to £80billion to bailout its struggling economy, Britain is expected to feel the impact of the economic turmoil in Europe within days. Credit agency Moody’s is expected to downgrade the credit status of both Lloyds Banking Group and the Royal Bank of Scotland by up to two places imminently. Barclays is also likely to be affected by the decision which will mean banks have to pay more to fund their activities. Impact: Credit agency Moody's is expected to downgrade both Lloyds . Banking Group and the Royal Bank of Scotland are by up to two places . imminently . Chancellor George Osborne wrote in a newspaper article yesterday that Britain’s attempts to rebuild its battered economy were being held back the crisis on the continent. He said: ‘Our recovery - already facing powerful headwinds from high oil prices and the debt burden left behind by the boom years - is being killed off by the crisis on our doorstep.’ The results show a desire for a say on Europe coming from all sections of society with little difference between Conservative and Labour voters or the percentages of men and women in favour of a vote. Out of Liberal Democrat supporters, 74 per cent are in favour of a referendum, compared to 82 per cent of the population as a whole. Criticised: Chancellor George Osborne wrote in a newspaper article yesterday that Britain¿s attempts to rebuild its battered economy were being held back by the crisis on the continent . According to Liam Fox, the former Defence Secretary, even if it doesn’t come in the immediate future a referendum is inevitable when European treaties are rewritten to solve the European crisis. Mr Osborne made this point last week when he said during a radio interview that any redrawing of European treaties would shift powers from the UK to Europe which would automatically trigger a vote under the terms of the treaty drawn up. Although the nature of how any such referendum question would be worded is not clear with aides to the Chancellor stating that he had not intended to suggest that it would necessarily be a straight ‘in’ or ‘out’ question. Ana Botin, chief executive of Spanish-owned bank Santander UK said the public needed to realise the close ties between Britain and the Europe and how a meltdown on the continent will have a serious detrimental effect on the UK’s prospects. Mr Osborne’s move to blame Britain’s struggling position on problems in Europe has been criticised by both Labour and Conservative politicians with . David Miliband saying the problems were actually caused by the emergency budget and coalition cuts. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said Mr Osborne was making ‘desperate excuses’, while Conservative backbencher Douglas Carswell said it was ‘demonstrably wrong’ to blame the Eurozone.","Four out of ten say Britain should pull out of Europe immediately .

Doctors are warning that an antibiotic-resistant strain of gonorrhoea, now considered a superbug, has the potential to be as deadly as the AIDS virus. Gonorrhea is the second most commonly reported sexually transmitted infection in North America. This particular strain of gonorrhea, known as HO41, was discovered in Japan two years ago in a 31-year-old female sex worker who had been screened in 2009. The bacteria has since been found in Hawaii, California and Norway. In a bid to avoid contracting gonorrhea, in particular the HO41 strain, people are encouraged to practice safe sex . HO41 has so far proved resistant to current antibiotic treatment and so it has been placed in the superbug category. ‘This might be a lot worse than AIDS in the short run because the bacteria is more aggressive and will affect more people quickly,’ Alan Christianson, a doctor of naturopathic medicine told CNBC. Nearly 30 million people have died from AIDS related causes worldwide, but Christianson believes the effect of the gonorrhea bacteria is more direct. ‘Getting gonorrhea from this strain might put someone into septic shock and death in a matter of days,’ Christianson said. ‘This is very dangerous.’ In a briefing on Capitol Hill last . week, William Smith, executive director of the National Coalition for . STD Directors, urged Congress to target nearly $54 million in immediate . funding to help find an antibiotic for HO41 and to conduct an education . and public awareness campaign. This particular strain of gonorrhea, known as HO41, was first discovered in Japan two years ago in a 31-year-old female sex worker . Although no deaths from HO41 have been reported as yet, experts say avoiding the disease completely is the best course of action. ‘People . need to practice safe sex, like always,’ Christianson said. ‘Anyone . beginning a new relationship should get tested along with their partner. 'The way gonorrhea . works, not everyone knows they have it. And with this new strain it's . even more important than ever to find out.’ Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted disease that has been known since medieval times. Sometimes known as ‘the clap,’ the infection can result in painful sores and genital discharge, and is associated with ectopic pregnancies and sterility in both men and women. Dctors are warning that an antibiotic-resistant strain of gonorrhoea has the potential to be as deadly as the AIDS virus . Left untreated, gonorrhea can lead to a . host of complications including pelvic inflammatory disease, . infertility, and blood stream infections. It also raises the risk for HIV because the lesions permit the AIDS-causing virus easier access to the bloodstream. Gonorrhea is especially common among people between the ages of 15 and 24. The . disease became curable in the 1940s when penicillin and other . antibiotics were introduced. Since then, the medical world has created . more new drugs that killed the ever-mutating gonorrhea bacteria. Nearly 30 million people have died from AIDS related causes worldwide, but the effect of the gonorrhea bacteria is more direct . On . a state-by-state basis, pockets of the U.S. are seeing giant spikes in . the disease. Utah saw a 74 percent rise in gonorrhea cases in 2012, with . the trend continuing into the first few months of this year. In . Minnesota, cases rose 35 percent in 2012, according to the state's . department of health, and according to the latest statistics from the . CDC, ‘During 2010–2011, 61% (31/51) of states, plus the District of . Columbia, reported an increase in gonorrhea rates.’ Cephalosporin, the last available class of antibiotics recommended for the treatment of gonorrhea, has been failing worldwide and there is the very real prospect that all types of gonorrhea will soon become untreatable. Professor Cathy Ison, head of the National Reference Laboratory for Gonorrhoea in the U.K. told the BBC . last week: ‘There is a possibility that if we don't do something then it could become untreatable by 2015.’","Gonorrhea is the second most commonly reported sexually transmitted disease in the U.S.

The Army has introduced new shirts that can be rolled up in warm weather, but there are fears soldiers will be forced to wear much-maligned elbow pads to avoid cuts and scrapes as a result. Personnel on duty have long complained about the current multi-terrain pattern uniforms, introduced in 2011, because they have removable foam elbow pads incorporated into the sleeve, so they cannot be rolled up in sweltering areas of operation like Afghanistan. From September Army chiefs will now introduce new shirts that can be rolled-up to increase their comfort, but there are reports troops will have to wear elbow pads, commonly used by skateboarders and BMX riders, to avoid injuries. Soldiers are worried they will be forced to wear elbow pads to avoid injury once the new shirts are introduced . One officer said the elbow pads will 'struggle for acceptance', while one infantryman called them 'pretty orthopaedic', reports The Times. However, a Ministry of Defence spokesman said the new shirts are only intended for use in barracks and other non-combat or exercise roles. He said: 'There were a lot of soldiers saying we should be able to roll up our sleeves in the hot weather. The Army has been looking at shirts we can wear in barracks for some time. 'All that is happening is the new shirt will supplement what we already have.' Prince Harry sports elbow pads while visiting the Jamaican Defence Force at Up Park Camp in Kingston . A change in policy has also been made that will allow soldiers to roll up the sleeves of their current uniforms (with the foam pads removed) - subject to their officers' discretion - before the new shirts are introduced. The spokesman added that elbow pads and knee pads are used by the infantry, while the multi-terrain pattern uniforms are used by other sections of the Army. Since their introduction in 2011, troops have complained that the multi-terrain pattern uniform's combat fatigues are 'ridiculous' and make them look like Action Man. Soldiers have criticised it as being ill-fitting, poorly designed, poorly made and 'too American'. The Ministry of Defence spent £40million on the new outfits, claiming that they will be more comfortable to wear with body armour and provide better camouflage.","Army will introduce new shirts that can be rolled up in warm weather .

Doctors Nikita and Arvind Rawal, from Beverly, East Yorkshire, discovered that their son was missing on the day their dream was set to come true. Devastating: Ishan, pictured far right with his parents Drs Arvind and Nikita Rawal and brother Rusheek, was found murdered the day his parents opened their hospital in his new home country . Ishan's body was discovered in woodland a few miles away from the hospital after a man who works for the Rawals admitted to kidnapping and strangling the boy. However . the Rawals, who previously worked at Hull Royal Infirmary and Castle . Hill Hospital, believe there is more to their son’s death. The family believe it may be the work of . more than one killer, orchestrated by their enemies in an attempt to . halt their work and force them to move back to Britain. They are desperate to bring their son’s killer(s) to justice and are calling on the British Government for help. Mrs . Rawal, 42, who moved to India with her husband and two sons Ishan and . Rusheek a year ago, said: ‘How can someone do such a thing? ‘He was such a talented boy - he played tennis and was getting on very well at school. ‘We are missing a very big part of our lives that we will never get back.’ Tragedy: Brit Ishan Rawal, eight, was kidnapped form the opening ceremony of his parents hospital in Indore, central India, pictured, and found strangled after his parents employee admitted the crime . It was Ishan’s brother who discovered . that the boy had gone missing during the inauguration ceremony at Royal . Shanti Hospital in Indore, the capital of the central India state. Mr Rawal, 43, said: ‘We spent an hour looking all over the hospital. ‘There were people everywhere so it was very hectic and when we couldn't find him, we reported it to the police. ‘We had our suspicions that he had been kidnapped.’ Shaan . Das, who worked as a servant at the Rawals’ house, had been seen . driving from the ceremony with Ishan on his motorbike, but returned . without him. When Mr Rawal . and police questioned Mr Das, he initially denied knowing where the boy . was but then said he had ‘taken him for a bike ride and left him . somewhere,’ Ishan’s mother Nikita said. Das knew both boys well and had often helped them download games to play on their computer. New project: Royal Shanti hospital's Facebook page where Mr and Mrs Rawal advertised for staff ahead of the opening last month . Mr Das, has admitted to killing Ishan 'because he was annoyed with the behaviour by Mr and Mrs Rawal,' the Daily Bhaskar reports. The paper alleged that Mr Das was 'quite annoyed' when Mrs Rawal refused to give him job in the hospital. However, . The Rawals refuse to believe their son was murdered over a job dispute . and is setting up a campaign to bring the killer to justice. Nikita said: ‘In March, it was decided he wouldn't work for the hospital. ‘But . he already had a job so he wasn't unemployed and it was months ago. We've requested an inquiry into what happened - it was so well planned, . we know there is more to it.’ Mr Rawal says the Indian police are . satisfied with the arrest of Das as the prime suspect and are not . concerned about looking for anyone else in connection with Ishan's . murder.

A member of one of Britain’s grandest aristocratic families is to appear in court this week accused of beating up his wife. Edward Alexander Somerset, the 54-year-old son of the Duke of Beaufort, faces six charges of assault. A preliminary hearing at Bristol Crown Court on Thursday will decide whether Lord Somerset will face trial. Lord Somerset, pictured with his wife Caroline at a fancy dress party in 1993, has been accused of beating his wife on six occasions . The father-of-two, who lives on the 52,000-acre Badminton Estate in Gloucestershire, is accused of assaulting Caroline, his wife of 30 years. Court documents reveal that Lord Somerset, a nephew of the eccentric Lord Bath, is accused of causing her actual bodily harm on six occasions. It is understood that one of the most recent alleged incidents led to Lady Somerset being hospitalised, which in turn led to police becoming involved. The first assault is alleged to have occurred at a London address and could date back more than 25 years. The other attacks are alleged to have taken place at Badminton – the couple live in Grade II-listed Essex House on the estate – with the most recent occurring last October. It is understood that one of the recent alleged incidents left Lady Somerset hospitalised . Millfield-educated Lord Somerset, who attended North Avon magistrates’ court earlier this month in connection with the charges, has two grown-up daughters, Francesca and Rose, with his 54-year-old wife. If  the case goes to trial, it is understood the prosecution will call several witnesses from the aristocracy as well as ‘downstairs’ staff from Badminton. The 17th century estate is  home to the world famous Badminton Horse Trials. This year’s event begins on Thursday, the day Lord Somerset is due back in court. Lord Somerset’s father is David, the 11th Duke of Beaufort, who is estimated to be worth £135million. His eldest brother, Henry John Fitzroy, Marquess of Worcester, 60, is heir to the estate and title. Lord Somerset is the third of the 85-year-old duke’s four children with his first wife, Lady Caroline Thynne. Lord and Lady Somerset married in 1982 at his family home, Badminton Estate . When they married in 1950, their London wedding was attended by George VI, Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret. The duchess, who died in 1995, was the sister of the 7th Marquess of Bath, eccentric owner of Longleat Estate, known for his boasts of having over 70 ‘wifelets’. The duke, who remarried in 2000, features on the Tatler list of ‘people who really matter’ where he is described as being an ‘incredibly dashing’ man who ‘utterly worships his children’. He is listed in joint 590th position in this year’s Sunday Times Rich List, which notes he stands to make £180,000 a year from a planned wind farm near Swansea. The dukedom – motto ‘I scorn to change or to fear’ – was created by Charles II in 1682 for Henry Somerset, 3rd Marquess of Worcester, who was given huge parcels of land, mainly in the West Country and South Wales. The couple live in a Grade-2 listed house on the 52,000-acre Badminton Estate in Gloucestershire . The name Beaufort refers to a castle in the Champagne region of France and is the only current dukedom to be named after a place outside the British Isles. The current duke is chairman of Marlborough Fine Art and was at the centre of a controversy four years ago when he was accused of cashing in on a 400-year-old aristocratic right, by charging taxpayers £280,000 to build a bridge over a river he owns in Wales. The 70ft footbridge was the only way to link the new Liberty Stadium – home of Swansea City and Ospreys rugby team – to an adjoining shopping park. The duke had to give his permission because he owns the bed of the River Tawe, which runs through the city. The council had to pay him for an easement order to build the bridge.

Mr Harding, 73, from Sheldon, Birmingham, said: 'I call it the minimum cinema because it is probably the smallest cinema in the world that uses all professional equipment. 'When I stand by the projector when it’s running and I am looking through the small port hole which is only five foot down to the screen it’s just like sitting in a full size projection room looking at the real thing.'

Despite being in a tiny converted bedroom, the cinema boasts four original cinema seats he salvaged when a local cinema closed down, with the projector showing films to the scale they were originally screened to large audiences. No tickets are needed when friends and fellow cinema enthusiasts come to see the historic equipment in action, which he picked up for a bargain when commercial cinemas closed. One of the CineMechanica projectors was made disposable when cinemas switched to digital while the other is capable of playing DVDs. 'I was quite lucky to get these projectors - it takes me back to the 50s, 60s, and 70s. I’m up here quite a lot. I love it. If I could live up here 24/7 I would.

He used to splice together old film reels, repair and maintain the machines when working in the cinemas and has been hooked on films since he bought a toy projector when he was seven-years old. And he has been glued to the screen since. His long career in cinema started after the manager at his local Odeon cinema promised him a job as a ‘rewind boy’ when he left school at 15. It entailed making the tea, maintaining projectors and being responsible for rewinding all the film reels after they were played. After an Oscar winning performance, despite not being able to view rated films, he was promoted twice to the position of ‘second projectionist’. He still visits the cinema as often as he can but says the advancements in technology have changed the industry beyond recognition. 'It used to take up to five men to get a single film on, now one person can do several at once,' he added. 'For the customer it’s changed for the best, you’ve got a good clear picture. From my point of view it has changed cinema for the worse. There’s just something about watching live mechanical cinema.'","Reginald Harding, 73, knocked through wall to make space for projector .

Consulate staff believed they were . under surveillance in the early hours of September 11 when a member of . the police unit guarding the compound was found taken photographs of the . inside of the mission, according to documents recovered from the site . by Foreign Policy magazine. Days after the attack, an . intelligence source told Fox News: 'One thing for sure is that the 17 . Brigade was nowhere to be found and the Americans were left on their own . in the assault.' Moving the consulate to the CIA annex might not have saved the four Americans who died in the September 11 strike. Two of the four dead were killed at the site when it came under fire in the six-hour, commando-style attack on the U.S. Mission in the . Libyan city, for which al-Qaeda and Islamist militia Ansar al-Sharia have been blamed. The uncovering of the cable's contents come a day after intelligent chiefs admitted the CIA was operating a covert . mission in the U.S. consulate in Libya when it came under attack. The CIA made the revelation as it . laid bare the heroic rescue by a handful of its agents in which they . fought off wave after wave of mortar and rocket attacks with just their handguns as they sought to infiltrate the compound and shepherd its American staff to safety. A timeline, released by the agency, has blown open the dramatic sequence of events, revealing for the first time that of the 30 American . officials evacuated from the country following the deadly attack, just seven worked . for the State Department. Killed: Ambassador Christopher Stevens (left) died of smoke inhalation, while agent Sean Smith (right) died in a . desperate battle with insurgents . Heroic: Former Navy SEALs Glen Doherty (left) and Tyrone Woods (right) were killed in a mortar attack . The rest were part of a crack team of . intelligence and security experts on a secret mission aimed at . counterterrorism and securing heavy weapons held by the embattled . regime. They had been operating out of a building known as 'the annex', around a mile away from the consulate in central Benghazi. Intelligence officials told how when the annex received a call about the assault, about a half dozen members of a CIA . security team tried to get heavy weapons and other assistance from the . Libyans. But with time running out, the team went ahead with the rescue attempt armed only with their standard-issue small arms. A fierce firefight ensued and the team managed to get into the consulate and shepherd its occupants back to the annex under constant attack from machine gun fire and rocket-propelled grenades. 'The security officers in particular were . genuine heroes,' an official said. 'They quickly tried to rally additional local support and . heavier weapons, and when that could not be accomplished within . minutes, they still moved in and put their own lives on the line to save . their comrades. 'At . every level in the chain of command, from the senior officers in Libya . to the most senior officials in Washington, everyone was fully engaged . in trying to provide whatever help they could.' The CIA revelations come after Barack Obama's administration came under sharp attack over its handling of the incident amid claims Washington told officers on the ground to 'stand down' before the rescue took place. Heroic: CIA agents engaged in a fierce firefight with heavily-armed insurgents at the consulate before shepherding its occupants to safety under constant attack from machine gun fire and rocket-propelled grenades . 'There . was no second-guessing those decisions being made on the ground, by . people at every U.S. organization that could play a role in assisting . those in danger,' the official added. 'There were no orders to anybody to stand down in . providing support.' In the first days after the attack, various administration officials . linked the Benghazi incident to the simultaneous protests around the . Muslim world over an American-made film that ridiculed Islam's Prophet . Muhammad. Only later did they publicly attribute it to militants, . possibly linked to al-Qaeda, and acknowledged it was distinct from the . film protests. The changing explanations have led to suspicions that the . administration didn't want to acknowledge a terror attack on U.S. personnel so close to the November 6 election, a charge President Obama has strongly . denied. Inferno: Armed attackers dumped cans of diesel fuel and set ablaze the consulate's exterior . Siege: The compound came under heavy mortar and gunfire during the attack, which lasted several hours . According to the timeline, around 9.40pm Benghazi time, officials at the CIA's relatively fortified and well-defended base in Benghazi got a call from State Department officials at the U.S. diplomatic mission about a mile away that the less-fortified public mission complex had come under attack from a group of militants. Other official sources said that the initial wave of attacks on the diplomatic mission involved setting fires using diesel fuel. 9.40pm - CIA officials in 'The Annex' get a distress call from the consulate saying they are under attack. 10.05pm - Armed only with handguns, team of about six CIA security officers leave their base for the public diplomatic mission compound. 10.30pm - With bullets whistling overhead, the CIA team move into the compound after unsuccessfully trying to get heavy weapons and help from local Libyan allies. 11.10pm - A Defense Department drone, which had . been on an unrelated mission some distance away, arrived in Benghazi to . help officials on the ground gather information. 11.30pm - U.S. personnel who had been working or staying at the mission all accounted for, except for Ambassador Stevens. 11.40pm - Driving back to the secure base, the evacuees come under further fire. 12am - The installation itself comes under fire from small arms and rocket-propelled grenades. 12am - A CIA security team . based in Tripoli, which included two U.S. military officers, lands at . Benghazi airport and begins plotting how to locate the missing ambassador. 1am - The patchy attacks on the base begin to die down after 90 minutes of fierce fighting. 4am - The . reinforcements from Tripoli take a convoy of . vehicles to the CIA base to prepare for evacuation. 4.30am - a fresh round of mortar attacks is launched on the base, killing two U.S. security officers. 5.30 - A heavily armed Libyan military unit . arrive at the CIA base to help evacuate the compound of U.S. personnel . to the Benghazi airport. From 6am - Roughly 30 Americans, as well as the bodies of . Stevens and the other three Americans killed during the attacks, were . loaded on planes and flown out of the city, several U.S. officials said. The dense smoke created by the fuel both made it hard for people at the compound to breathe and to organise a response to the attack. About 25 minutes after the initial report came into the CIA base, a team of about six agency security officers left their base for the public diplomatic mission compound. Over the succeeding 25 minutes, the CIA team approached the compound, and tried, apparently unsuccessfully, to get local Libyan allies to bring them a supply of heavier weapons, and eventually moved into the burning diplomatic compound, the intelligence official said. At around 11.10pm, a Defense Department drone, which had been on an unrelated mission some distance away, arrived in Benghazi to help officials on the ground gather information. By 11.30, U.S. personnel who had been working or staying at the mission had been rounded up except for Ambassador Stevens, who was missing, the intelligence official said. When they tried to drive out of the diplomatic compound to return to the CIA base, however, the convoy carrying U.S. evacuees came under fire. Once they got back to the CIA base, that installation itself came under fire from what the intelligence official described as small arms and rocket-propelled grenades. These patchy attacks went on for roughly 90 minutes, the intelligence official said. Around the same time, a CIA security team . based in Tripoli, which included two U.S. military officers, landed at . Benghazi airport. Upon its arrival, however, the team spent some time . trying both to arrange local transport and to locate the missing . Ambassador Stevens. After some time . trying to solve these problems, the security team that had flown in . from Tripoli eventually arranged for an armed local escort and extra . transportation, but decided not to go the hospital where they believed . Stevens had been taken. In part this was because they had reason to . believe Stevens was likely dead, and because security at the hospital . was believed, at best, to be 'uncertain,' the intelligence official . said. Not long before dawn, the . reinforcements from Tripoli managed to take themselves and a convoy of . vehicles to the CIA base to prepare for an anticipated evacuation. However, . just after they arrived at the CIA base, the official said, a new round . of attacks on that facility was launched, this time with mortars. Although the mortar attacks lasted only 11 minutes, two US security . officers were killed by a direct hit from one of the shells, the . intelligence official said. Finally, . a bit less than an hour later, a heavily armed Libyan military unit . arrived at the CIA base to help evacuate the compound of U.S. personnel . to the Benghazi airport, the official added. Over . the next few hours, roughly 30 Americans, as well as the bodies of . Stevens and the other three Americans killed during the attacks, were . loaded on planes and flown out of the city, several U.S. officials said.","Classified cable shows U.S. recommended the consulate move into CIA base .

For a split  second you stand utterly helpless  as your dropped iPhone plunges towards an unforgiving pavement. But now inventors have devised an unlikely answer to one of modern life’s most expensive little mishaps – an airbag for your smartphone. Motion-sensing technology already built into most smartphones is used to detect when it has dropped – and the mini airbag is then deployed before it hits the floor. The idea is the brainchild of retail and technology giant Amazon, which has patented the protective system for mobile phones, electronic readers such as Amazon’s own Kindle, computer tablets and cameras. This week the company won approval for the patent, which was filed in America by Amazon’s founder, Jeff Bezos, 48, a self-made billionaire who has forged a career from pioneering ideas. The patent reads: ‘Prior to impact between a surface and a device, a determination of a risk of damage  to the device is made. If the risk of damage to the device exceeds a threshold, a protection system is activated to reduce or eliminate damage to the device.’ The patent details a system that utilises a gadget’s built-in gyroscope, camera, accelerometers and other onboard sensors in order to determine if the device has entered an airborne state. If it has, the  technology will release airbags to reduce potential damage – or possibly even change the trajectory of its fall by firing jets of air. It may sound far-fetched but there is no doubting the idea has a market, as iPhone owners in the UK alone spend tens of millions of pounds a year repairing their devices. Victor Seidel, a lecturer in science entrepreneurship at Oxford University, last night applauded the effort to try new ideas, saying: ‘I am not sure the next phone I buy will be fitted with an airbag but we are often surprised by what ideas become successful. Borrowed: A traditional airbag in cars is deployed upon impact, cushioning the passengers' heads as they are thrust forward. The phone system hopes to use similar techniques to prevent damage to the mobile upon inevitable impact . ‘An airbag incorporated into a phone might mean the end of cumbersome cases, but it might be impractical to produce. Jeff Bezos is a man known for going his own way and being successful, but I think the real question is: Has he come up with this idea because he keeps dropping his own phone?’ And Ernest Doku, telecoms expert at uSwitch.com, said: ‘What’s next, smartphones with built-in parachutes? Or maybe handsets with wings and propellers? ‘This sounds like a feature worthy of Bond, codename SOS SMS. But airbags for windbags sounds like a lot of hot air to me. From a logistical point of view, the handset would have to be rather bulky to hide an airbag.’ Peter Bee, a technician at Fix My iPhone in London, said: ‘No matter what weird or wonderful way we come up with to protect our phones, there will always be someone out there who ends up breaking it.’","System uses motion sensors to detect when a phone has been dropped .

An adorable dog that was rescued after suffering horrific injuries and thrown onto a Brooklyn street is on the road to recovery thanks to New York City school children who helped raise money to pay for medical bills. The young pit bull puppy named Misty was found with serious injuries all over her body and was rescued from a city shelter several weeks ago. Students from an Upper West Side school began following the dogs progress after Second Chance Rescue began to treat Misty's wounds and a Facebook page was created. Scroll down for video... Dog's life: Every dog has it's day and today it was the turn of Misty to meet local schoolkids who helped make her as good as new after suffering horrendous injuries . Misty's Journey: Funds to help Misty recover were raised through her very own Facebook page . All better: You'd be hard pressed to realise the troubled life Misty has led from these cute pictures, but she very nearly didn't make it . It's believed the horrific injuries were sustained when the pitbull was used as a bait dog for dog fighting. When she was no longer needed, the puppy who was around 6 to 9 months old was left to die on a Brooklyn street corner. The school set up bake sales and raised more than $800 to help pay for the dog's care. Dr. Kim Spanjol, a school counselor who works with the students on humane-education programs said the students were inspired to help Misty. 'We do donate to a lot of dogs, but Misty was the victim of dog fighting which is a big problem in our city, around the country and around the world.' Horrific: Misty was used as a bait dog to train fight dogs. She was left for dead on the streets of Brooklyn . Charity: New York organization Second Chance Rescue pulled the badly wounded Misty from an overcrowded city shelter to give her one-to-one treatment . Second chance: Misty wouldn't have stood a chance had it not been for the work of New York City's dog rescue shelters . Misty visited the school so students could meet the dog they'd been helping in person. 'There aren’t any bad dogs, there are bad owners,' Spanjol said. 'And that’s a message that the kids feel really strongly about – that pit bulls are often victimized because of that image and it’s really, really shameful and the kids want to do everything they can to show people that pit bulls are also sweet and loving dogs and Misty is a perfect example of that.' The students have formed a group called the Youth Animal Protectors Club. Jackie O’Sullivan of Second Chance Rescue is hoping Misty’s story inspires kids and adults. 'Her suffering should not be in vain,' O’Sullivan said. 'Her story should raise awareness of dog-fighting in the city. Misty is doing much better and is now ready for adoption.

Together Miuccia Prada and Catherine Martin are a fashionable tour de force. The pair teamed up to create a wardrobe of dresses for Carey Mulligan's character in Bas Lurhmann's hotly anticipated film, The Great Gatsby. Now some of the 40 dresses are going on display in an exhibition at the Prada New York Epicenter which will run until 12th May. Stunning: Great Gatsby star Carey Mulligan poses in front of some of the Prada and Martin-designed frocks . Intricate: The heavily beaded flapper dresses will be on display at the Prada New York Epicenter until 12th May . Challenge: According to Martin, the hard part was making the frocks live up to F.Scott Fitzgerald's vision . Mulligan herself appeared a pale shadow of her glamorous character, Daisy Buchanan, in a drab black frock, although Isla Fisher looked wonderful in pale pink. Luckily, the stunning 1920s inspired frocks, with their beading and sparkle, more than made up for Mulligan's lack of pizzazz and epitomised the glamour of the roaring twenties, although according to Prada herself, glamour wasn't really a consideration during the design process. 'When I read [the book], it was psychological,' she told British Vogue's website. 'It was not about glamour for me. It was a real [study of] personality, very internalised. 'It was meant to be about light. It became about money, because Luhrmann wanted to show her as the most beautiful and rich woman on earth.' According to Martin, the real challenge wasn't making gowns that were historically accurate but ensuring they lived up to F.Scott Fitzgeral's characters. 'The reality is that from 1920, I could find a photo or a fashion illustration that would support almost any choice that we've made in the film,' Martin revealed. Teamwork: Director Baz Luhrmann and cast members Carey Mulligan and Tobey Maguire with Miuccia Prada . Support: Singer Katy Perry and actress Maggie Gyllenhaal both attended the launch wearing Prada frocks . Inspiration: Many of the gowns in the collection were inspired by past collections for Prada and Miu Miu . 'But we are not making a documentary. We are trying to express a story in a way in which Fitzgerald's visceral modernity is able to transgress the plane of the screen.' Although the fabulous frocks have already appeared on the silver screen, they made their public debut during a launch party for the exhibition, which attracted some of Hollywood's glitziest stars. Among them were Carey Mulligan, who as Daisy, was lucky enough to wear the frocks and British socialite, Alexa Chung. Also on the guest list was Isla Fisher, who looked fresh-faced and pretty in a pale pink Prada dress, and Maggie Gyllenhaal, who also plumped for Prada. Write caption here .

Mass killer Thomas Hamilton, who shot dead 16 schoolchildren and their teacher at Dunblane, central Scotland . Today's shooting that left dozens dead at an elementary school in Connecticut brings back chilling memories of Britain's worst school massace, Dunblane. Sixteen children and their teacher, Gwen Mayor, were killed on March 13, 1996 when misfit loner Thomas Hamilton burst into Dunblane Primary School gym and opened fire. The former Scout leader fired at random in the school's gym before turning the gun on himself. The world looked on in horror as details of the bloody massacre in Scotland unfolded. Andy Murray, the British tennis player, was a pupil at the Dunblane . school at the time of the shootings. He has described hiding under the . table in his classroom during the attack. It . prompted outrage from around the world, including from the Queen and . then Prime Minister John Major, who called it a 'sick and evil act'. 'I . find it difficult to express the feelings I know will be felt . throughout Dunblane,' said the Scottish Secretary, Michael Forsyth, who . represented Dunblane. 'This . is a close-knit community where everyone knows everyone else and the . impact of this horrible tragedy will be felt in every household.' The subsequent public inquiry . revealed that Hamilton had licenses for six guns and had previously been . investigated by local police for inappropriate behavior around young . boys. Among other transgressions, while . serving as a scout leader, Hamilton reportedly took photos of semi-naked . boys without their parents' permission. The year after the massacre Tony Blair . introduced the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997 which banned the remaining . handguns in England, Scotland and Wales, and left only some historic and . sporting handguns legal.

Twelve people were confirmed dead and three were fighting for their lives two years ago after a taxi driver went on the rampage in the UK's worst shooting incident since the Dunblane massacre . Dunblane was one of three major . mass-shootings in modern British history, after the tragedy of . Hungerford and before a second school massacre in the Lake District in Cumbria two years ago. On August 19 1987, Michael Ryan . killed 14 people, including his mother, and injured 15 others in the . small Berkshire town of Hungerford. The 27-year-old unemployed labourer . and antiques dealer went on the rampage as he drove around the town. He . shot picnickers, a man mowing his lawn and a couple sitting in their . back garden. A police chase ended with Ryan . barricading himself into a classroom at his old school, the John O'Gaunt . Community College, where he shot himself. The most recent UK mass-shooting was in Cumbria, when 12 people were shot by a cab driver who went on a bloody rampage in the Lake District before turning the gun on himself. Derrick Bird, a divorced father-of-two, was discovered in woodland near Boot, Cumbria, by police. In 1990 polls showed that a substantial majority of Americans, nearly 80 per cent, supported stricter limits on guns. Now Americans appear evenly divided between those who want tougher restrictions and those who want to stick with current laws. Gun rights groups are a powerful lobby in the United States, where easy access to guns is a way of life in many of the more conservative and rural areas. The right to bear arms is guaranteed by the US constitution, alongside such basic rights as free speech and freedom of religion. In a speech to the National Urban League civil rights group, Mr Obama said he wanted a national consensus in the effort to stem gun violence. Despite the Second Amendment's protection of gun rights, Mr Obama said: 'I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that an AK-47 belongs in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals - that they belong on the battlefield of war, not on the streets of our cities.' Gun control is a highly partisan issue in the U.S.. The powerful National Rifle Association, which fights gun control and has huge sway in Congress, has successfully made the issue nearly off limits among most legislators who fear the group's opposition at re-election time. Republican challenger Mitt Romney said in a television interview that changing the nation's laws would not prevent gun-related tragedies. He mistakenly said many weapons used by the suspect in the Colorado shooting were obtained illegally. Authorities say the firearms used to kill 12 people and injure dozens were purchased legally.

"More than 200,000 vehicles damaged or destroyed by the monster storm . 3,300 towed by New York City authorities during the cleanup . 535 still unclaimed and to be auctioned in May . Prices start at $300 but may not actually be able to be driven . By . James Daniel . PUBLISHED: . 10:03 EST, 21 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:37 EST, 21 April 2013 . When Hurricane Sandy struck New York last October thousands of cars were either damaged or abandoned in the storm. In the days that followed, more than 3,000 were towed from emergency routes for street cleaning. City officials estimate more than 500 Cadillacs, Toyotas and BMW's remain unclaimed. Now the city is auctioning these 'flood-damaged but may be salvageable' vehicles. Submerged but salvageable: Cars that were abandoned or damaged by Hurricane Sandy are to be sold at auction next month.Their owners decided not to claim them after the destructive storm . The storm which swamped lower Manhattan and destroyed beachfront communities including the Rockaways in Queens. The storm surge saw many cars drift down the street several blocks from where they were parked. Some landed on front lawns, inside homes or under trees. An estimated 230,000 vehicles in the region were damaged or destroyed by Sandy, according to insurance industry estimates. Iconic: Images such as this one of a taxi garage in Queens, NY became symbolic of the destruction and disruptions to daily life that Sandy created . With so many unclaimed cars to deal with the city set up a telephone hotline for owners to pick up their posessions. Technically, under state law, unclaimed cars can be sold after 10 days. Owners, lien holders and insurance companies were notified. Records were also checked at the National Insurance Crime Bureau. As of January, 696 vehicles were unclaimed but this weekend there are now 535 unclaimed vehicles that are set to be auctioned next month. There are some potentially good deals to be had with prices as low as $300. Pile of junk: Usually when cars become submerged under water as in this street in Hoboken, New Jersey their engines are ruined... but you never know! Bargain hunting buyers would have to be prepared to take a gamble however because not only do the cars hot have keys, the vehicles can't be registered for road use without an inspection. In some cases they may only be useful for spare parts. The website of the auctioneer David R Maltz in Central Islip on Long Island states there are passenger cars luxury cars, classic cars, vans, SUVs, 4x4s, sport cars and pickup trucks available. 'We’ve sold one as low as $300 and we had one above $10,000,' said auctioneer Richard Maltz to the New York Post.' Just because a vehicle is titled as flood-damaged doesn’t mean it’s inoperable. To some degree, it’s a gamble,' Not going anywhere: Parked cars are partially submerged in flood waters in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in New York October 30th 2012 . There are some risks: usually when salt water gets into the engine the car is going nowhere but the scrap heap. Saltwater can ruin computer-controlled fuel and braking systems, heating and air-conditioning. Water didn't reach the engines in all cases which means there is a glimmer of hope for any buyer. Buyers need to bring 25 per cent of the deposit in cash or a bank cheque. The auctions will be held, on May 2 and 7 with the proceeds going into city funds and 10 per cent to the auctioneer. City officials have said that they will work with owners if they suddenly realise their cars are at the auction house.","More than 200,000 vehicles damaged or destroyed by the monster storm .

The mother of a slain police officer says the upcoming execution of his 'killer' will bring her peace - despite more than 2,000 activists forming a huge protest in the streets against the conviction. Troy Davis, 42, is set to be executed by lethal injection next Wednesday after he was convicted of killing police officer Mark MacPhail, who was shot dead in Savannah, Georgia, in 1989. Anti-death penalty activists, who also claim Davis was wrongly convicted, chanted and held banners through Atlanta on Friday - but Mr MacPhail’s mother Anneliese remains convinced Davis is guilty.

Conviction: Troy Davis, left, is set to be executed by lethal injection next Wednesday after he was convicted of killing police officer Mark MacPhail, right, who was shot dead in Savannah, Georgia, in 1989 . Peace: Police officer Mark MacPhail MacPhail's mother Anneliese MacPhail remains convinced Davis is guilty . ‘I will never have closure,’ Ms MacPhail told CNN. ‘But I may have some peace when he is executed.’ The case has captured international attention because of concerns about the quality of evidence involved in Davis’s conviction - but Ms MacPhail said she has ‘never had any doubts’ it was him. ‘I think these people are just against the death penalty,’ she told CNN, of the many protesters who claim to be worried the state will put an innocent man to death. ‘They don't know what happened.’ Georgia's Board of Pardons and Paroles is expected to meet on Monday to consider whether to stop Davis' execution by lethal injection, which is scheduled for next Wednesday. Marching army: Thousands gathered in Atlanta, Georgia, to protest the pending execution on Wednesday of Troy Davis, who they say was wrongly convicted of killing a Savannah police officer in 1989 . Crowds: Thousands gathered in downtown Atlanta to protest the pending execution on Wednesday . ‘I pray that this rally will have an . impact on Pardons and Paroles,’ said marcher Solana Plaines, of . Savannah, Georgia. ‘I hope they will do the right thing.’ 'I will never have closure. But I may have some peace when he is executed' Mark MacPhail's mother Anneliese . Davis's supporters say there is no physical evidence linking him to the crime and that key witnesses in his trial have since recanted their testimony. ‘You just can't give up hope,’ said Ellen Kubica, who travelled all the way from her home in Germany to attend Friday's event, which featured banners reading: ‘Too much doubt to execute.’ Martin Luther King III, son of the late civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr, joined the march. Reverend Al Sharpton, a civil rights activist and television show host, also attended.

It is blatantly clear that there is no reason for this man to be sitting on death row' Reverend Al Sharpton . In a rare move, the U.S. Supreme Court in August 2009 ordered a new hearing for Davis to assess what he said was new evidence showing his innocence. The justices transferred the case to a U.S. District Court in Georgia for a hearing and determination of his claims that new witnesses will clearly establish his innocence. A year later, the judge, William T. Moore Jr, rejected Davis' claims of innocence. But on Thursday, supporters of Davis delivered petitions with more than 600,000 names to the parole board. New York: Demonstrators gather near Times Square in Manhattan to protest the execution of Davis on Friday . Message: A woman holds a sign at a protest outside President Barack Obama's campaign headquarters in Chicago, one of 300 rallies held worldwide on Friday, ahead of a last-ditch parole board hearing for Davis . In a column last week in the Atlanta Journal Constitution, former FBI Director William Sessions called for Davis's sentence to be commuted to life in prison, saying the case was 'permeated in doubt'. However in an opposing column written in late 2008 and republished on Thursday, Spencer Lawton, the district attorney who prosecuted Davis, said the condemned man had a fair trial. The claim that seven witnesses at the trial had subsequently recanted their testimony was ‘not believable’, Lawton wrote - and he denied any witnesses had been coerced by police.

"By . Kate Loveys . Created 10:44 PM on 10th July 2011 . Teachers will be allowed to use force on pupils again after after new figures revealed the extent of violent behaviour in our classrooms. Ministers lifted the 'no touching' ban to ‘unequivocally restore adult authority to the classroom’. Almost 1,000 pupils – some as young as five – are excluded for abuse or assault every school day. Assault: Figures show that 44 teachers were taken to hospital after being attacked at school last year . Serious attacks on staff have increased, with 44 teachers taken to hospital last year. The new measures, to be introduced in September, state all schools should scrap existing ‘no touch’ policies. At present, teachers are not allowed to touch a child in the course of teaching them a musical instrument or helping them in an accident. But teachers will now be able to use reasonable force to eject unruly pupils from the classroom, or prevent them from leaving. The measures will allow teaches to stand between pupils or physically block their path. Staff will be able to guide children by the arm or restrain youngsters to get them under control. Teachers may get involved to break up fights or prevent disruptive pupils from attacking other classmates or teachers. Former deputy Katharine Birbalsingh . The figures, from an official Government report, lay bare the full extent of the mayhem in our classrooms. Astonishingly, one in four teaching staff has been the subject of a false allegation by pupils. These range from sexual abuse to verbal assault. One in six has had a false allegation made against them by a member of a pupil’s family. The worrying trends have led . two-thirds of teachers to consider leaving the profession, according to . the Department for Education. Former deputy head Katharine . Birbalsingh – dismissed after criticising behaviour in state schools at . last year’s Tory conference – said violence was prominent because the . school system was 'broken'. She said: 'Pushing and shoving and . worse forms of violence are a huge problem. The problem is the endemic . culture of blame in schools – bad behaviour is also attributed to bad . teaching. 'Management push this theory, children use it as an excuse, . and teachers themselves begin to believe it. 'You . have a situation where struggling teachers will not seek help for fear . of looking incompetent. And meanwhile children are left to think that . they can get away with anything and push the boundaries.' A recent series of attacks – ranging from stabbing to rape – support the report’s findings that violent behaviour is prominent in the classroom. Experts have blamed soft parenting and teaching for creating a generation unable to respect authority or interact socially without lashing out. They fear parents struggling to juggle the pressures of modern life are unable to spend quality time with their children. Instead many are left unsupervised in front of a TV or computer. Nick Seaton of the Campaign for Real Education said: 'Adults fail to teach discipline and a respect for authority. 'At a tender age children are told . they are the centre of the universe and it makes them too self-centred . and totally uncontrollable.' There were almost 1,000 exclusions . every day in England’s schools last year. In addition, one in four children have been bullied at school and one in five have been a victim of bullying outside school. Charlie Taylor, the Coalition’s . 'behaviour tsar', said: 'Behaviour is good at most schools, but these . figures demonstrate concerning levels of violence in a small number. 'This . kind of behaviour is a serious disruption to teaching and learning. It . is a major factor in deterring good people from becoming teachers and is . a common reason for experienced teachers to leave the profession.' The Department for Education today publishes guidance for teachers on how to deal with bad behaviour. Ministers want to 'unequivocally restore adult authority to the classroom'. They have axed Labour’s 600 page guidance – which they claim confused teachers – and have replaced it with just 52 pages. The new measures, to be introduced in September, say all schools should scrap existing 'no touch' policies. At present, teachers are not allowed to touch a child in the course of teaching them a musical instrument or helping them in an accident. Teachers will also be able to use reasonable force to eject unruly pupils. And heads will be able to search without consent for an extended list of banned items such as alcohol, illegal drugs and stolen property. Ministers will also place an onus on schools to crack down on bullying. In addition, pupils who make false allegations will face suspension, expulsion, or criminal prosecution. Schools Minister Nick Gibb said: 'This new, clear and concise guidance removes the red tape that has stopped teachers from being confident in maintaining discipline in the classroom.' Disciplinarian Sir Michael Wilshaw, who turned the worst school in England into one of best, has been tipped for the post of chief inspector of schools. Education Secretary Michael Gove has approached the headmaster of Mossbourne Academy, in London, to persuade him to accept the vacant £180,000 post at Ofsted. Sir Michael takes an uncompromising view towards substandard behaviour. He imposes strict penalties on pupils who do not do their homework and has a zero tolerance approach to disruptive behaviour.","1,000 pupils are excluded every day .

"By . Tamara Cohen . UPDATED: . 09:38 EST, 26 January 2012 . The moral maze of life has never been easy to negotiate. But a survey suggests more and more of us are taking a wrong turn. According to researchers, Britain is experiencing a major increase in dishonesty with many of us willing to lie and cheat. Having an affair, lying to further one’s interests, buying stolen goods and having underage sex are all seen as more acceptable than they were a decade ago. Scientists at the University of Essex believe levels of dishonesty could get worse because the young seem more tolerant of it. Model citizen? Take the integrity test yourself - and be honest! They are so concerned about its future impact on society they have set up a Centre for the Study of Integrity devoted to the subject. In the year 2000, 70 per cent of us said an extra-marital affair could never be justified, but now it is just 50 per cent, according to the University of Essex study. The proportion who say picking up money found in the street is never justified fell from 40 per cent to 20 per cent over the same period. In eight out of ten categories termed as ‘low level dishonesty’, rather than major criminal activity, the number who say each activity is totally unacceptable has fallen. Less integrity: Researchers have found that having an affair, drink driving, underage sex and lying are more acceptable today than they were in the year 2000 . Failing to report damage to a parked car and breaking speed limits appear to have become an acceptable part of life – with only a minority condemning them. There was more opprobrium attached to not paying a train or bus fare – one of the few activities which is seen as less acceptable – than having an extra marital affair. Women were shown to have slightly more integrity than men, but in both sexes it was unrelated to social class, education or income . Integrity study . Some things seem more outrageous today with falsely claiming benefits seen as less justifiable in these straitened times than in the boom years. Attitudes to dropping litter have remained the same. Accepting bribes and drink-driving have fallen a bit, but are still mostly condemned, however smoking cannabis or having underage sex are seen as more acceptable. Professor Paul Whiteley, who led the study, said: ‘It is apparent that large changes have occurred in sexual mores, attitudes to keeping money found in the street and smoking cannabis. These activities are much more sanctioned than they were 11 years ago.’ An online survey was carried out in 2000, and another group of 2,000 people were surveyed last year. There was a strong correlation with age – with just a fifth of under 25s saying lying is never justified compared with 40 per cent of over 65s. However, the researchers do not know whether this indicates we are heading for a less honest society or whether honesty increases with age. It comes as a ‘trust barometer’ by the PR company Edelman found two-thirds of us do not trust politicians to tell the truth, and just 38 per cent trust businesses. The researchers say integrity has a ‘profound effect’ on society, as communities who are reluctant to work together ‘have worse health, worse educational performance, they are less happy and they are less economically developed’. Less integrity: This graph shows how acceptable certain activities were to people in 2000 (grey) and in 2011 (black) Interesting: How different age groups scored on the integrity test .","British people are less honest that they were a decade ago, survey reveals .

An avalanche killed five Saturday, some 12,000 feet high in Colorado’s rugged Rocky Mountain back country. The snowboarders were found dead  after becoming trapped in Colorado’s White River National Forest. Authorities believe it was the snowboarders, themselves, who triggered the avalanche that occurred around 1pm. Only one member of the back country snowboarding group survived the tragedy on Loveland Pass, which juts to over two miles above sea level. Deadly: Loveland Pass (pictured) in Colorado is a favorite spot for back country snowboarders. An avalanche killed five in the 12,000 foot high pass April 20 . Clear Creek County Sheriff Don Krueger said in a statement that six snowboarders were caught in the slide, but did not release the condition of the lone survivor. The Colorado Department of Transportation closed a highway as many skiers were headed home from nearby Arapahoe Basin ski resort. Tragic: Clear County Colorado Sheriff Don Krueger, pictured, reported that a sixth snowboarder was rescued, but did not reveal the survivor's condition . Lisa Clarke Devore, who was headed back to Denver from the resort, told The Associated Press she saw a fire truck and ambulance on the pass, as well two search dogs headed into the area of the slide. She says she saw several ambulances, including one towing snowmobiles, headed toward the pass. On Thursday, a 38-year-old snowboarder died in an avalanche south of Vail Pass. Eagle County sheriff's officials said the man and another snowboarder likely triggered the slide after a friend on a snowmobile dropped them off at the top of Avalanche Bowl. Nationwide, more than 18 people have died in avalanches this season, according to the Colorado Avalanche Information Center.

"By . Shona Sibary . PUBLISHED: . 16:33 EST, 1 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:33 EST, 1 May 2013 . The other day I was playing with my three-year-old daughter, Dolly. She’s obsessed with the story of Snow White and keeps sticking a mirror in front of my face and inquiring: ‘Who is the fairest of them all?’ The answer must always, of course, be her. I once ventured away from this party line and dared to say: ‘Dolly, your beauty is true, but Mummy’s face is quite nice, too.’ And she looked at me, utterly horrified, and said: ‘No it’s not. Your eyes are wonky and your nose has a big bump on it.’ She was right, of course. Children are nothing if not honest. But here’s the thing. It didn’t matter. I still pulled her to me — this wonderfully zany little girl who constantly tells me she loves me to the moon and back — and I felt so happy my heart could burst. A perfect life: Shona with her children (from left) Dolly, Monty, Annie and Flo, wonders if things would have been different if she was born beautiful . So what if I have a face that might crack a mirror? Why on earth would I care? I may be somewhat lacking in the looks department, but I am happier and more successful than most women I know. I was reminded of this rather satisfying fact this week when actress Olivia Colman, who won huge acclaim for her role as DS Ellie Miller in the brilliant ITV drama, Broadchurch, admitted she felt fortunate she was not a ‘conventional’ beauty. She went on to say that there are fewer parts available for prettier actresses — suggesting she attributes her well-deserved success to the fact that she isn’t a looker. It’s a searingly honest thing to say and I, for one, whole-heartedly agree — not with the fact Olivia Colman is ugly (actually, I think she has a rather lovely face), but that being plain can often play hugely to a woman’s advantage. I have written before about coming to terms with the fact I’ll never be beautiful. It has taken me years to accept that, unlike my fellow Daily Mail writer Samantha Brick, men never fall over themselves to open doors for me or, indeed, proffer free bottles of champagne on aeroplanes. But, cruel fate that it is, I have four amazing children — and Samantha, like so many other attractive women, yearns to have a baby. I’m sure, given the choice of a pretty face or a warm bundle in her arms and a face like mine, she’d go for the latter. Who is better off? Shona believes childless, self-confessed 'most beautiful woman in the world' Samantha Brick, right, would swap her face for a baby . Of course, I’m not suggesting that any woman can help how they look or, indeed, should suffer because of it. But in an age when so much emphasis is placed on physical perfection, it’s a relief when someone like Olivia Colman admits that being plain can be a blessing for a woman. Because I firmly believe that’s how it has worked out for me. Indeed, I am convinced that if I had been blessed with the looks of Brigitte Bardot, life wouldn’t have panned out in quite the wonderful way it has. Today, I look in the mirror and while the reflection staring back at me is unremarkable, looking this way has given me the strength, determination and force of character to get out there and prove myself in other ways. And prove myself I have. Compare my story with that of my two close friends from school — both stunning girls whom I spent years feeling desperately inadequate standing next to. I used to be convinced they were guaranteed a glittering future, with the promise of a handsome husband, children and whatever else they wanted the world to conjure up before the altar of their exquisite beauty. 'One kind reader even suggested that . next time I have something published I might be a little more . public-spirited and place a bag over my head. Do I care?' We hooked up recently at a reunion. They have both kept their looks — indeed it was still hard, a quarter of a century on, to quash that same feeling of inferiority when they walked into the room. But a few glasses of wine later, it materialised that one remains single, having never found a man to meet her exacting standards, and the other did get married — to someone equally gorgeous — but he turned out to be gay and left her for a man. I’m not being smug when I say they oohed and aahed over photographs of my four children — Flo, Annie, Monty and Dolly. Well, maybe I am a little bit. But they were doing absolutely nothing to disguise the fact that, in their opinion, my life was pretty near perfect. And, actually, I couldn’t help but agree. The reason for this is simple. Once I accepted what my limitations were on the looks front, I then set about making up for them in other ways. Unlike prettier girls I knew, I didn’t make my prospective boyfriends jump through a series of inexplicable hoops before deciding to date them. If they wanted to take me to an all-you-can-eat Tex-Mex buffet instead of a fancy French restaurant then — hey — who was I to complain? Bring on the chicken wings! If one boyfriend turned out to have an unfortunately hairy back, I didn’t — as one girlfriend admitted to doing — dump him instantly with a shudder of disgust. I simply felt relieved that the pressure was off to shave my own legs every single day. Happy with her looks: Actress Olivia Colman said being plain has its advantages . When I eventually met Keith at the age of 22, I felt unbelievably grateful that he was interested in me. I didn’t think there was a more interesting, good-looking or richer man out there — I was just relieved that any man at all wanted to hang out with a woman who looked like me. So what that he didn’t always know the right thing to say at social occasions or choose the appropriate attire for a family wedding? I fell in love with him because of his personality — and he, because of mine. I can remember sensing from certain quarters — friends and, indeed, my own parents — a feeling that I could do better. Well, guess what? Those friends are still single, my parents are now divorced and 14 years on Keith and I remain soulmates. But, for me, the benefits of being plain haven’t stopped there. Over the past couple of years I have been photographed frequently to accompany features I have written. It’s not my choice — it’s simply part of the job. But what has surprised me has been the extreme reaction from complete strangers who seem to feel the urge to constantly comment on how cross-eyed and ugly I am. They could, instead, remark on my writing ability or disagree with my opinion. The fact that they don’t only leaves me to assume that I am pretty good at my job — hooray! Admittedly, I’ve had to develop a fairly thick skin. It can be a little unsettling to be constantly told that my photograph is putting people off their breakfast. One kind reader even suggested that next time I have something published I might be a little more public-spirited and place a bag over my head. Do I care? Well, the TV offers keep flooding in and I’m still being commissioned, which just goes to show that Oscar Wilde was right — the only thing worse than being talked about is, well, not being talked about. And thanks to my looks there doesn’t seem to be any real danger of that happening any time soon.There is also something quite liberating — having hit my early 40s — about no longer fretting over my appearance. I’m not husband-hunting or looking for a date. The only people who see me every day are my family, the postman and other mothers. None of them care if I am made up to the nines or wearing kitten heels. Quite simply, I don’t feel the need to validate my worth as a woman by turning heads in the street or being complimented on my face. All I need to do is take a long look at my career, my family and the many positive letters I receive from other people who feel supported through what I write. I agree with Olivia Colman. Being a plain Jane has made my life a dream.","Our writer agrees with Olivia Colman that being plain can be an advantage .

The legendary writer, who was at the helm of the title for 32 years and  invited millions of women to join . the sexual revolution, passed away at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center. Hearst CEO Frank A Bennack, Jr announced the news of her death this afternoon. Media icon: Former Cosmopolitan editor Helen Gurley Brown, pictured at an event for the title in 1990, passed away in New York today . Sex and the Single Girl, her . grab-bag book of advice, opinion, and anecdote on why being single . shouldn't mean being sexless, made a celebrity of the 40-year-old . advertising copywriter in 1962. Three years later, she was hired by . Hearst Magazines to turn around the languishing Cosmopolitan and it . became her bully pulpit for the next 32 years. She said at the outset that her . aim was to tell a reader 'how to get everything out of life - the money, . recognition, success, men, prestige, authority, dignity - whatever she . is looking at through the glass her nose is pressed against.' On leaving her post in 1997, she said: 'It was a terrific magazine. I would want my legacy to be, ""She created something . that helped people."" 'My reader, I always felt, was someone who needed to . come into her own.' Along the way she added to the . language such terms as 'Cosmo girl' - hip, sexy, vivacious and smart - . and 'mouseburger', which she coined first in describing herself as a . plain and ordinary woman who must work relentlessly to make herself . desirable and successful. She put big-haired, deep-cleavaged . beauties photographed by Francesco Scavullo on the magazine's cover, . behind teaser titles like 'Nothing Fails Like Sex-cess - Facts About Our . Real Lovemaking Needs.' Editrice: Gurley Brown during an interview at her office in New York in 1982 . Male centerfolds arrived during . the 1970s - actor Burt Reynolds' (modestly) nude pose in 1972 created a . sensation - but departed by the '90s. Brown and Cosmo were anathema to . militant feminists, who staged a sit-in at her office. One of them, Kate . Millet, said, 'The magazine's reactionary politics were too much to . take, especially the man-hunting part. The entire message seemed to be ""Seduce your boss, then marry him.""' 'I've never worked anywhere . without being sexually involved with somebody in the office' Another early critic was Betty . Friedan, who dismissed the magazine as 'immature teenage-level sexual . fantasy' but later came around and said Brown, 'in her editorship, has . been a rather spirited and gutsy example in the revolution of women.' Bad Girls Go Everywhere, the . 2009 biography of Brown by Jennifer Scanlon, a women's studies . professor, argued that her message of empowerment made Brown a feminist . even if the movement didn't recognize her as such. There was no disputing that Brown quickly turned a financial turkey into a peacock. Within four issues, circulation, . which had fallen below the 800,000 readers guaranteed to advertisers, . was on the rise, even with the newsstand price increasing from 35 cents . to 50 and then 60. Talented: In a turn of events that could have been scripted on Mad Men, Gurley Brown became one of the highest-paid copywriters in the U.S. Sales grew every year until . peaking at just over 3 million in 1983, then slowly levelled off to 2.5 . million at $2.95 a copy, where it was when Brown left in 1997. (She . stayed on as editor in chief of the magazine's foreign editions.) She was still rail-thin, 5-feet-4 . and within a few pounds of 100 in either direction, as she had kept . herself throughout her life with daily exercise and a careful diet. 'You can't be sexual at 60 if . you're fat,' she observed on her 60th birthday. She also championed . cosmetic surgery, speaking easily of her own nose job, facelifts and . silicone injections. An ugly duckling by her own . account, Gurley Brown was born in Green Forest, Arkansas on February 18, 1922. Growing up in the Depression, she earned pocket money . by giving other children dance lessons. Long marriage: Gurley Brown with her husband of 51 years, David, producer of Jaws, The Sting, and Driving Miss Daisy, who she wed in 1959 . Her father died when she was 10 . and her mother, a teacher, moved the family to Los Angeles, where young . Helen, acne-ridden and otherwise physically unendowed, graduated as . valedictorian of John H Francis Polytechnic High School in 1939. All the immediate future held was . secretarial work. With typing and shorthand learned at a business . college, she began her career at the William .

Her . talent for writing was quickly noticed, and, in a turn of events that . could have been scripted on Mad Men, became one of the highest-paid female . copywriters in the U.S. She also evidently was piling up the experience she put to use later as an author, editor and hostess of a TV chit-chat show. 'I've never worked anywhere . without being sexually involved with somebody in the office,' she told . New York magazine in 1982. Asked whether that included the boss, she . said, 'Why discriminate against him?' Marriage came when she was 37 to . twice-divorced David Brown, producer of . Jaws, The Sting, and Driving Miss Daisy, in 1959. The couple . would remain together until his death in 2010. Her husband encouraged Brown to write a book, which she wrote on weekends, and suggested the title, Sex and the Single Girl. They moved to New York after the . book became one of the top sellers of 1962. Moviemakers bought it for a . then-very-hefty $200,000, not for the nonexistent plot, but for its . provocative title. Natalie Wood played a character named Helen Gurley . Brown who had no resemblance to the original. She followed up her success with a long-playing record album, Lessons in Love, and another book, Sex in the Office, in 1965.

The Florida judge who presided over Casey Anthony's murder trial says he was shocked by the jury's 'not guilty' verdict because there was 'sufficient evidence' that she killed her two-year-old daughter, Caylee. Judge Belvin Perry made the extraordinary admission in his first interview since the close of Anthony's trial nearly two years ago. 'There were two sides to Casey Anthony,' Perry told NBC's Today Show. 'There was the side that was before the jury, where she portrayed the role of a mother who had lost a child - someone who was wrongfully accused. And then you could notice the change and transformation in her when the jury went out. Scroll down for video . 'Shocked:' The Florida judge who presided over Casey Anthony's murder trial, Belvin Perry, says he was shocked by the jury's 'not guilty' verdict . First interview: Perry (right) made the extraordinary admission in an interview with NBC's Savannah Guthrie (left) Released: Casey Anthony (right) and her lawyer Jose Baez (left) leave the Orange County Jail in Orlando the day that Anthony was released in July of 2011 . Watch the full interview in NBC's TODAY Show here . 'She was very commanding, she took charge of different things, and you could see her sometimes scolding her attorneys.' Perry said he believes the jury let the young mother off the hook for . first-degree murder because she was 'very manipulative' and had an . extraordinarily personable lawyer. The jury handed down its 'not guilty' verdict in July of 2011. At the moment that he read the verdict from the . jury, Perry described feeling 'surprise,' 'shock' and 'disbelief.' 'Wrong' verdict: Perry said 'There was sufficient evidence to sustain a verdict of murder in the first degree in this case' He said he had to read the verdict twice in his head to make sure he had read it correctly. Perry was surprised because he believed 'there was sufficient evidence to sustain a verdict of murder in the first degree in this case,' he said. He also felt that prosecutors had 'proved a great case.' 'But you’ve got to realize this was a circumstantial evidence case,' he added. 'All the defense had to do was create that reasonable doubt, and that’s what they did.' Anthony's lawyer, Jose Baez, played a large role in swaying the jury's opinion of her innocence, Perry said. 'The state had better lawyers, but Mr. Baez was very personable,' he said. 'He came across as someone that you would like. 'It’s like someone trying to sell a used car. Who are you going to buy it from? The most likeable salesperson.' Anthony wasn't quite as personable as her lawyer, but she could put on a good front before the jury, Perry said. 'There was always two sides to Casey,' he said. There was the public persona that she wanted the jury to see and there was that side that she showed when the jury was not there.' He specifically recalled a day when Anthony fought . with her lawyers over a suggestion that she take a plea deal for . aggravated manslaughter instead of first-degree murder. Shocking admission: Perry says the jury found Anthony not guilty because she was 'very manipulative' and had an extraordinarily personable lawyer . 'Car salesman:' Perry compared Baez (pictured) to a used car salesman as he described how the lawyer persuaded the jury into thinking Anthony was innocent . 'I will never forget that day,' he said, noting that he was in earshot of the conversation while she was in a holding cell. 'All of a sudden, you heard shouting coming from the holding cell, some four-letter words coming from the holding cell, and she was quite upset,' he said. 'So upset that one counselor suggested that she was incompetent to proceed.' Anthony's trial was televised and made into a spectacle as one of the most sensational stories of the year, sparking protests, drawing huge crowds to the courtroom and attracting international news coverage. 'I had no earthly idea that it would . command the attention that it did worldwide,' Perry said. 'It was truly a . fantastic experience.' He said he didn't think that the . cameras in the courtroom - which are permitted by Florida state law - . had affected the outcome of her trial. 'In Florida we've always had cameras and I think people need to know how their justice system works,' he said. Emotional: Casey Anthony tries to collect herself during a break in her murder trial at the Orange County Courthouse in Orlando, Florida. Judge Perry says there was 'sufficient evidence' to prove that she was guilty of killing her daughter . The jury found Anthony guilty of four misdemeanor counts of providing false information to a law enforcement officer. She was released from jail on July 17, 2011. In January of this year, a Florida appeals court reduced her convictions from four to two counts. Asked whether justice has been served in Anthony's case, Perry said that remains to be determined. 'Well justice has been served in the sense that the jury has spoken,' he said. 'But justice will finally be served one day by the judge of judges. And she will have to live with this and deal with this for the rest of her life.'","Judge Belvin Perry presided over Anthony's murder trial .

The BBC was accused of fostering a ‘culture of secrecy’ yesterday after imposing a gagging order on its new director-general. Tony Hall’s £450,000-a-year contract contains a clause which bans him from making ‘any derogatory or unfavourable public remark’ about the broadcaster while he is in the post – or for two years afterwards. Critics said it was ‘deeply worrying’ that the BBC was still attempting to gag its senior executives following accusations that the corporation sought to cover up allegations of sexual abuse by Jimmy Savile. New chief: Tony Hall's contract contains a clause which bans him from making 'any derogatory or unfavourable public remark' about the broadcaster while he is in the post - or for two years afterwards . Lord Hall, who started work last week, told BBC staff the organisation was ‘learning the lessons’ of the past year. But the gagging clause has raised questions about his ability to speak freely about faults he finds within the BBC. The contract stipulates: ‘You will not, without the prior written consent of the BBC, whether during the period of your appointment or within two years following the termination date, write for publication or make any public statement about the BBC or its affairs. ‘You shall not at any time during the period of your appointment or within two years following the  termination date make any derogatory or unfavourable public remark or statement whether orally or in writing with regard to the BBC, member of the BBC Group, member of the BBC Trust, member of the Executive Committee, employee, customer, client or supplier of the BBC and/or member of the BBC Group.’ The BBC said the contract did not ban Lord Hall, 62, from ‘whistle-blowing’ about failures and said the clause was a routine inclusion in contracts for every member of its executive board, including previous director-general George Entwistle. Former boss: The BBC said the clause was a routine inclusion in contracts for every member of its executive board, including previous director-general George Entwistle . But it does appear to make it more difficult for Lord Hall to change the culture of the BBC by being open about its failings. Critics said the inclusion of the clause suggested the BBC had failed to learn lessons from recent scandals, including the Savile affair. Scandal: Critics said the inclusion of the clause suggested the BBC had failed to learn lessons from recent scandals, including the Jimmy Savile affair . Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘It is deeply worrying that the BBC would try to gag its senior executives, especially after the lessons it should have learned from recent failings. ‘BBC management should practice what BBC journalists try to encourage in other organisations – openness and transparency. ‘A culture of secrecy meant Jimmy Savile’s crimes never came to light early enough to stop them. ‘The danger of a gagging clause is that a recently departed director-general could be prevented from raising an issue publicly that licence fee payers should rightly know.’ BBC sources said the contract was not intended to stop Lord Hall from acknowledging faults within the corporation, including during his appearances before MPs at the Culture, Media and Sport Committee. He is expected to face questions over widespread redactions in the Pollard Review, the £2million inquiry into why a Newsnight investigation of Savile was axed. Under the terms of his contract, Lord Hall will be entitled to a £225,000 payout, even if he proves to be a failure. Mr Entwistle walked away with £450,000, the equivalent of 12 months’ notice, despite spending only 54 days in the job before resigning. It is the first time the BBC Trust has published a director-general’s contract. It said it had done so ‘in the interests of transparency’. Employment lawyers said gagging clauses had become common for senior executives. A spokesman said the BBC was reviewing its use of such clauses. He said: ‘We recognise that confidentiality clauses are a cause for public concern. ‘Their use at the BBC is something that we are currently looking at as part of the Respect At Work Review and we expect to have something to say on the matter very shortly.’","Tony Hall’s contract bans him from 'derogatory public remarks' about BBC .

A judge yesterday ordered strict curbs on a potential suicide bomber to be relaxed so he could enjoy a ‘normal social life’. Mr Justice Wilkie said the alleged Al Qaeda fanatic ought to be able to mingle more freely with students at his university to avoid his ‘embarrassment and isolation’. The constraints on the 24-year-old Somali man – considered one of the country’s most dangerous terror suspects – were ‘chilling’ and ‘disproportionate’, he said. His High Court ruling ordering Home Secretary Theresa May to water down the restrictions deals a serious blow to the Government’s fight against terrorism. And it comes despite fears by the security services that the man – known as CF – will contact other Islamic extremists to plot attacks against Britain. The decision could lead to similar challenges by other terror suspects and may fuel concerns that the judiciary is chiselling away at measures to protect the UK from jihadists. ‘CF’ is one of nine people subject to Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures (TPIM) orders, introduced last year to restrict their movements, the use of computers and who they can meet. The suspect, who is thought to have tried to get to Afghanistan for terrorist training and of fighting for the feared al-Shabaab group in Somalia, is only allowed to mix with undergraduates when it is ‘exclusively for the purpose of studies’. But Mr Justice Wilkie said it was difficult for CF to avoid ‘informal social contact’ at lectures or the library. ‘They [the orders] must impose a chilling effect on CF’s participation in the life of a student on this course without any, apparent, beneficial effect on national security,’ he added. However, he threw out a bid by CF to own an MP3 player and have his curfew cut.In June last year, CF was charged with repeatedly breaking a strict ban on visiting the Olympic Games venue in Stratford, east London. He was not prosecuted. Tory MP Patrick Mercer said: ‘If this fellow was concerned about his social life then maybe he shouldn’t have been spending his time in Afghanistan and Somalia. ‘His lack of social life doesn’t keep me awake at night. The prospect of him having an opportunity to blow himself up does.’","Al Qaeda fanatic will be able to mingle more freely with fellow students .

'All an act': Chef Nigella Lawson, pictured on The Taste, has described her on-screen persona as a 'circus act' She might present a sunny and seductive image as she tells you about her flourless chocolate brownies, but Nigella Lawson warns she's not all sweet. In a candid interview, the television chef, 53, describes herself as 'dark' and tells of her childhood melancholia. She said: 'Maybe I didn't feel very lovable for a child. When I was small I just couldn't get out of my little dark place. 'My mother thought I was autistic, because I would be sitting on a swing talking to myself.' Her suggestive television performances with recipes such as self-saucing chocolate puddings have won her many male fans. Miss Lawson described her on-screen persona as a ‘circus act’ Her late husband, the journalist John Diamond, had teased her about her flamboyant inner self she said, but she used it for her programmes. Miss Lawson said: ‘It’s part of me - the circus act. But I had to bring it out. John used to say I had a hidden gay man inside of me.’ The chef, 53, was speaking in the wake of her new found fame in America, where she has acted as a judge on ABC cooking show The Taste. A figure-hugging red dress she wore on screen attracted particular attention. And she said the dress she wears on the front cover of her latest book, Nigellissima, about Italian cooking, was probably inspired by one worn by actress Catherine Deneuve in classic film Belle du Jour, which tells of an apparently perfect wife with hidden passions. In an interview published in Newsweek magazine, she told of darker times before she entered the limelight. Her father was Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, and her mother was Vanessa Salmon, from the family which created the Lyons Corner House chain of restaurants. On-screen persona: Nigella Lawson is known for her suggestive television performances on her cooking shows . Latest book: Nigella Lawson said the dress featured on the cover of Nigellissima was probably inspired by one worn by actress Catherine Deneuve in Belle du Jour . Miss Lawson, wife of multi-millionaire advertising mogul-cum-art collector Charles Saatchi, 69, said: ‘As I get older I am much less prone to bouts of melancholia.’ No tears: Nigella (pictured yesterday) said: 'People think that if you cook you're all sweetness and light. And I am a dark person' She went on: ‘I used to not be able to get up in the morning.’ Miss Lawson said that difficulty in getting up was a known sign of depression, adding ‘Well - I’ve got better at that.’ But, in contrast to her sunny and seductive image, she said: ‘I am dark. People think that if you cook you’re all sweetness and light. And I am a dark person. ‘Which doesn’t mean I don’t take an inordinate amount of pleasure in life. ‘There’s a fantastically bad biopic of Mussolini. And he says to Mrs. Mussolini, “Why do you always look on the dark side?” And she says, “There is no other side.” It’s almost worth watching that film for that reason.’ Staying with the emotions, and . speaking of her aversion to crying, Miss Lawson said: ‘I don’t like . women crying in offices, but then I’m not crazy about men crying in . offices either. ‘I did send my boss home once for crying in the office. ‘Even if I’m exhausted to the point of weeping I wouldn’t. I’m proud and I never cry.’ Moving on to her performance in her . cookery shows - often lampooned for being sexually suggestive - Miss .

Lawson said: ‘I used to think there was a discrepancy, between the . circus and the act-seriousness: now I think everything’s dark and light . at the same time. It’s life totally.’ The celebrity chef says she has become less prone to melancholia as she has got older . She also warmly discussed her relationship with the film crew for her shows - who have remained the same since her very first series, produced when late husband John was dying. ‘They’re my family,’ she said. ‘My children remember them from when they were little. ‘If I was to lose them it would be a much greater loss: I wouldn’t mind if we never put the programs out.’ She also simply enjoys the hubbub of having to produce the programmes she said, with the profit she makes - after amassing up to £20m from her cookery career so far - not much of a spur to work. ‘I don’t like being left all alone to myself,’ Miss Lawson said. ‘I don’t like the emptiness and the void - the sense when the light goes off when the fridge door closes.’ Miss Lawson also recalled former-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher wincing when her father Nigel Lawson drove her through London, speeding through red lights. The cookery writer has spoken in the past of how she never thought she could please her mother, who would shout and beat her.

A male British nurse last night denied plotting to help a New York policeman to kidnap, rape and eat female victims as police dug up his garden for clues. Kent Police swooped on Dale Bolinger, 57, after it emerged that 'Cannibal Cop' Gilberto Valle, currently on trial on sensational charges of conspiring to murder and cook a series of women, had been corresponding online with a cannibalism guru in England. The English cannibalism enthusiast claimed in sick exchanges with Valle, 28, last summer that he had previously eaten a white boy aged five and a black woman - and in a grotesque British twist advised using the fat from female breasts to make Yorkshire puddings and roast potatoes. Arrested: Dale Bolinger from Canterbury, Kent, was arrested in connection with planning acts of cannibalism with New York police officer Gilberto Valle . Bolinger, who is said to work at a Kent hospital, was quizzed at his home together with another man after a tip-off from police in the U.S. The emailer also had a recipe for 'human haggis' using the lungs and stomach. As he spurred his American associate on, he used the aliases MeatMarket Man and Moody Blues, and even recommended eating a victim alive, saying 'I think of it as eating her to death.' The emailer also offered to fly to Valle to help him kill and butcher a woman, offering to bring anaesthetic gas and a meat cleaver. By kidnapping and eating a variety of women they could evade capture, unlike the Yorkshire Ripper, he added, saying, 'Girls go missing all the time'. Kent Police following up the reports from America have arrested two men from Canterbury aged 57 and 30 - one of them male nurse Bolinger, and have searched and dug in his garden seeking clues. Both of the British pair were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy offences, grooming and the possession of child abuse images, and are now on police bail. But Bolinger, who separated from wife Rosemary last year, and who shares his home with son Rick, a would-be performance artist and amateur poet, told reporters he denies all the allegations against him. Arrested: Dale Bolinger, pictured, is one of two men from Canterbury, Kent in the UK who has been arrested in connection to New York's 'Cannibal Cop' case, according to reports .

New York City police officer Gilberto Valle who is charged with plotting to kidnap, rape, torture and cook women alive before eating them . A nurse since 1979, he has been suspended from his nursing job with East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust. Arriving by bicycle back at his rented £100,000 end-of-terrace former council house, Bolinger, who has six cats and three grown-up children, was asked if he denied the allegations against him. Bolinger, clad in a black woolly skiing hat, a blue fleece, jeans, gloves and white trainers, said: 'Yes, I do deny them. I don't want to say anything, I have to leave it to the police.' The nurse told The Times: 'None of this is real. It is all fantasy. I have spoken to the police and they are undertaking inquiries.' He added: 'It was my stupidity. Because of going online and saying stupid things and putting stupid things about, thinking that it was funny.' Meanwhile, Mr Bolinger's next-door neighbour how he saw police searching the 57-year-old suspect's garden sheds and digging in his garden. The neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'The police turned up last Thursday at about 7am. They were here until about 10pm. There were about seven police vehicles parked outside. 'I could see police going into the back garden. There were two police dogs and they were looking through the two garden sheds. Target? Kathleen Mangan, right, was the subject of horrifying e-mails between Valle and other internet users. He claimed he could lure his wife to India so she could be eaten . An undated photo submitted as evidence shows Gilberto Valle with his daughter. Valle is accused of conspiracy to kidnap a woman and unauthorized use of a law enforcement database that prosecutors say he used to help build a list of potential targets . Sobbing: Kathleen Mangan sobbed in court, shown here in a sketch, as she discussed her husband's plot to abduct, torture and eat dozens of women . 'There was another police person with a shovel. I saw him digging all the soft soil in the flower beds. I think it was soil that looked like it had been dug up recently.' James Godden, 31, who lives near . Bolinger, told KentOnline: 'We saw police here from about 7am last . Thursday and they were all day. 'They had forensics teams and sniffer dogs in the house. We don't know him and have never really seen him.' A police source said: 'Officers examined some areas of the garden that looked like they had been dug up but the police did not carry out a full-scale search of the garden.' New York policeman Valle is being tried on suspicion of conspiracy to kidnap, after being caught by his wife Kathleen Mangan, 27, looking as obscene fetish websites focusing on cannibalism. Among his intended victims was his wife and other acquaintances, one a New York primary school teacher. He is also said to have discussed his plans with a co-defendant from New Jersey, and a butcher in India who said there was an oven to cook Valle's wife in in Pakistan. Valle claims his vile exchanges were all fantasy, but he allegedly used police computers to compile files on more than 100 potential victims - and insisted to his British correspondent 'Moody Blues' that he was serious about his plans.

The emailer suggested cutting living victims' feet off and barbecuing them before their eyes. Feet meat was a delicacy, he claimed. When Valle suggested a particular woman as a victim. 'Moody Blues' said he would like her liver 'lightly cooked to keep it sweet and tender'. Valle replied: 'I'm dying to taste some girl meat.' The emailer also suggested using the bones for stock, and added: 'Cut off their t*** and slow roast. That way you'll got lots of girl fat. Great for roasting potatoes and Yorkshire pudding.'

On Facebook Bolinger is pictured with a live snake curled over his shoulder - and among is 'favourites' is the cooking equipment specialist Lakeland, along with a fan page for Olympic heroine Jessica Ennis. On his Friends Reunited website Bolinger fondly remembers his years at the nursing college he graduated from in 1979. Neighbours said Bolinger's son Rick lived with his father - and sometimes the younger man had a girlfriend staying there too. Rick Bollinger has a degree in theatre and performance from the University of Kent in Canterbury, and since graduating has scratched a living as a performance artist with the Accidental Collective - whose members stage bizarre drama 'happenings', and also writes poetry online under the name Rickasaurus Rex. His poems include numerous references to masturbation, and in one he describes himself as 'a punk who likes lattes'. The British suspect separated from his wife Mrs Bolinger, 55, last year, after 32 years of marriage. A director of a company linked to the disability charity Scope, she was 15 years ago diagnosed with cerebral palsy - and has long lobbied for better access for the disabled, even appearing on Radio 4 and in newspapers, as well as pressing Gordon Brown for change when he was premier. Speaking at the former marital home in Eastbourne, East Sussex, she said: 'I don't know anything about the arrest. We are separated. I haven't seen him for over a year. He is my husband in law only.' His daughter Laura-Jane, 26, who is her mother's carer said: 'I knew he had been arrested but not what for.' A spokeswoman for the East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation, where Bolinger works, said yesterday: 'A member of staff is suspended pending further police inquiries.' She refused to specify where he worked within the trust. A police spokesman said: 'Kent Police has been in contact with U.S. Law enforcement agencies in relation to this investigation.'

Weighing just 3lb 5oz, Eleana Hasting, was the smallest baby in Britain to have open heart surgery. She arrived six weeks prematurely with a missing valve, a hole between two chambers of her heart and dilated pulmonary arteries. Eleana Hasting, who underwent life-saving surgery aged nine days old, is today celebrating her first birthday . Doctors detected that something was wrong during a routine scan just 22 weeks into the pregnancy and since birth she has had three operations and spent 130 days in intensive care. But now parents Francesca and Darren, who describe the past year as an 'emotional rollercoaster', have decorated a ward Birmingham Children’s Hospital to celebrate their child's first birthday. Mother Francesca, 36, said: 'This year has been an emotional rollercoaster. Eleana has not left intensive care for 130 days. 'The downs are real lows but the highs are euphoric. It’s wonderful to see Eleana rolling about smiling.' Eleana Hastings with parents Francesca and Darrren . and brothers Jamie, 11, and Alfie, 2, and sister Imogen, 8, . Eleana arrived on January 13, 2011, and was put on a ventilator because her inflamed arteries were compressing her airways. Her tiny body struggled to maintain oxygen levels, and surgery was the only option. After nine days in intensive care, . Eleana was transferred from University Hospital Coventry and . Warwickshire to Birmingham Children’s Hospital where leading cardiac surgeon Mr William Brawn performed a four-hour procedure . to close the hole in her heart and reconstruct her lung arteries. Just ten weeks later, and aged only three months, she had to undergo a second major open heart operation to enlarge the way into her lung arteries and reconstruct the still large lung arteries. Her parents hoped she would be discharged from hospital last July, but she was rushed back into hospital scarcely two weeks later. Since then she has suffered a heart attack, needed a third heart operation and spent Christmas on a life support machine. She has spent just 16 days at home . with her family in Cheylesmore, Coventry and her hospital bedside has . been transformed into a living room to accommodate her two brothers, . Jamie, 11, and Alfie, two, and sister Imogen, eight. Eleana’s . parents have been forced to put their lives on hold and Francesca lives . at Ronald McDonald House, a charity centre next to the hospital, so she . can spend maximum time on the ward. Darren who works as a courier during the week joins the family at the hospital over the weekend.

Cuts to the Navy will leave Britain defenceless and ‘ripe for the taking’, the Falklands War veteran Sir Sandy Woodward has warned. In a rare intervention, Sir Sandy, who led the Naval task force that helped retake the Falkland Islands in 1982, said Britain would be left unable to defend its interests around the world unless cuts to the fleet are reversed. And he warned that Britain could even lose its permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council if it is seen to be unable to defend overseas territories like the Falklands. Fears: Falklands veteran Sir Sandy Woodward said Britain would be left . unable to defend its interests around the world and could even lose its . permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council . The warning came in a letter to the Commons defence committee, which is investigating Britain’s future defence needs. It is jointly signed by a number of other senior figures from the Falklands era, including Brigadier Julian Thompson, who led 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines during the conflict, and Admiral Sir Michael Layard, who commanded the requisitioned troop ship Atlantic Conveyor which was sunk by Exocet missiles. Calling for a change of course, they said defence cuts had already reduced Britain’s standing in the world, with potentially dangerous consequences for Britain’s trade and energy interests. They added: ‘It is evident that the UK is rapidly becoming a different nation by default and one less likely to be respected by friends and foes alike. ‘Our strategic reach has been severely curtailed because we will no longer be able to support the United States militarily in the key way which the UK has done for decades. ‘This might put in doubt our position as a permanent member of the UN Security Council if we become unable even to protect our own dependent territories.’ Sir Sandy singled out the ‘debacle’ surrounding the replacement of Britain’s aircraft carriers, which will leave the fleet with no operational capacity for a decade. Following a U-turn last year, ministers announced the new carriers Queen Elizabeth and Prince of Wales will be equipped with 12 jump jet F-35B Joint Strike Fighters, at a cost of £500 million each. But they will not be ready to fly until 2020, a decade after Harrier jump jets went out of service. Following a U-turn last year, ministers announced the new carriers Queen Elizabeth and Prince of Wales will be equipped with 12 jump jet F-35B Joint Strike Fighters, at a cost of £500 million each . Even when they are ready, Sir Sandy said the new jets ‘will not provide Britain with a full carrier strike capability’. And he warned their use would make it impossible to deploy other key aircraft, such as air-to-air refuelling and airborne early warnings, from the carriers. The letter also casts doubt on Government proposals to rely on military capability provided by allies, such as France. ‘The altogether unreliable response of some NATO partners in Afghanistan ought to have forewarned defence planners of this delusion,’ it said. ‘Further proof of this unjustifiable reliance is the possible withdrawal of the French carrier from service in the on-going attempts to save the French economy. This completely destroys the defence planning assumption that the French carrier will be a credible alternative for UK power projection in the absence of Royal Navy sea-air capabilities.’ Sir Sandy accused ministers of ‘paying lip service’ to the need to maintain credible defences, adding: ‘This will not impress or deter those that would do us harm. Failing to attend to this issue of great National import is tantamount to saying to our enemies that “We are ripe for the taking!”’ ‘The altogether unreliable response of some NATO partners in Afghanistan ought to have forewarned defence planners of this delusion,’ it said. ‘Further proof of this unjustifiable reliance is the possible withdrawal of the French carrier from service in the on-going attempts to save the .

An acne pill banned in parts of Europe has been linked to the deaths of seven British women.Dianette is still prescribed to thousands of women in the UK for severe skin conditions. Yet an investigation has been launched in France after four women who took it died. The latest data from the UK’s medicines regulator reveals that during the past three years, seven women in the UK have died while taking the drug, and there have been 83 reports of suspected side effects such as depression and hair loss. Dianette, which is prescribed only to women because of the hormones it contains, is known to increase the risk of blood clots. However, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has insisted it has ‘no new concerns’ and that women should continue taking it. Six of the deaths were attributed to blood clots or other vein blockages and one was as a result of a fall. None of the deaths or side effects has been directly attributed to the drug, but all have been reported to the MHRA through  its ‘yellow card’ scheme, which allows doctors and patients to record suspected drug reactions. Last month, regulators in France, where the pill is also prescribed as a contraceptive, announced they were suspending the use of Dianette after data linked it to the deaths. The European Medicines Agency, which regulates medicines across Europe, has also launched a review of its safety. An inquest heard that Charlotte Porter, 17, from Allington, near Maidstone, Kent, died in March 2010 of a deep-vein thrombosis after taking Dianette for acne. Dianette: Women taking a contraceptive pill are more likely to develop blood clots . Charity shop worker Helen Schofield, 33, died of a blood clot three weeks after starting to take Dianette in 2008. The coroner said there was a ‘pronounced link’ between the drug and her death. Doctors in the UK are advised against prescribing the drug as  a contraceptive because of research that linked it to a seven-fold increase in the risk of developing blood clots. An MHRA spokesman said: ‘Dianette is an effective medicine for treating the distressing conditions of severe acne and excessive hair. ‘Despite recent developments  in France, we have no new  concerns.’German manufacturer Bayer said: ‘Bayer believes that Dianette has a favourable benefit-risk profile when used in accordance with the label.’ An earlier version of this article said Charlotte Porter may have had an undiagnosed blood clot before being prescribed Dianette.

Scientists have invented a 'suicidal' satellite, attached to a giant sail, that can destroy dangerous space junk. The CubeSail, developed by the University of Surrey, carries the satellite into orbit where it then attaches itself to floating debris. Once a satellite has fixed onto its target, the large solar sails deploy and slows the speeding debris down enough so it falls out of orbit. This is an artist's impression of what the CubeSail is expected to look like when it's launched. The mini satellite can be seen in the centre of the deployed sail . The mini satellites, weighing only 6lbs, are placed inside the giant sail. While in space, the satellites attach themselves to debris. The sail then opens, slows the debris down so it falls to Earth, and is destroyed by the atmosphere . Another plan to clear space junk was announced in April by British space company Astrium UK. Astrium's plans would see a 'chase' satellite fitted with five or more harpoons which can fire at a moving target. Using laser and radar guidance systems, a piece of space junk would be targeted, and then captured with a gas-propelled harpoon on a tether. Once the space junk is secured, a smaller sub-satellite detaches from the chase satellite and pulls the junk downwards to burn up as it re-enters the Earth's atmosphere. Then the chase satellite would then search out another target. The debris then burns up in the Earth's atmosphere - along with the 6lb satellite. There is said to be around 5,500 tonnes of floating debris currently orbiting the planet, travelling at five miles per second. Scientists at the University of Surrey have been working on the project, funded by the European space company Astrium, for the last three years. It is hoped the first satellite, called Space Sails, could be launched by the end of the year. Professor Vaios Lappas, lecturer in altitude and orbit control systems at the university, believes the Space Sail satellite offers a cheap way of getting rid of space junk. It is an alternative to the more expensive method of shooting debris down with lasers. He said:  'There is a lot of debris in space and there is a need to declutter it. 'We have had two collisions in the last three years. When that happens it just creates even more debris. As the sails deploy, they twist from around the satellite in the centre. Once deployed the sail slows debris down until it can no longer orbit and falls to Earth. It is then burnt off in the Earth's atmosphere . This image shows the size of the CubeSail when it's fully open. The sail is five metres long and five metres wide . The mechanism for deploying the sail being tested at the University of Surrey . 'We are working on ways we can get the Space Sails to stick onto the debris. 'There has already been techniques published on capturing space debris, like using nets or harpoons and those are two techniques we could use. 'Other people have been thinking about using robotic arms, but that could be expensive. 'Once the sails are on the piece of debris, it will decelerate quickly, burn up in the Earth's atmosphere and evaporate.' All the space junk around the planet is the result of 50 years of abandoning spacecraft. Collisions with space debris can destroy expensive technology. Such a collision could also see potentially large pieces of debris coming back down to Earth. The build-up of debris - which is expected to grow at a rate of five per cent each year - is also believed to obstruct satellite television and other communications signals. Work on the Space Sail project has been completed but needs extra funding before it can be launched into space. Prof Lappas said 'Protecting our planet and environment is key for sustainable growth. 'This is a novel, low cost space mission and can offer a low cost/mass solution to the problem. 'It can be used for future satellites and launches and dramatically reduce the problem of space debris.'

A deadly bird flu virus sweeping through China has taken the first steps towards becoming a global threat to humans, experts have revealed. In the space of one month, the avian strain known as H7N9 has spread through all 31 Chinese provinces and claimed 125 victims, killing a fifth of those infected. Scientists say it is mutating rapidly and already has two of five genetic changes believed to be necessary for human-to-human transmission. Experts speaking in London today said . there was no room for complacency over H7N9, and warned against the . mistake of assuming it was a far-away foreign problem. A Chinese tourist wears a face mask in front of a portrait of leader Sun Yat-sen at Tiananmen Square in Beijing. Scientists say it is mutating rapidly and becoming more of a threat to humans . GPs have been sent letters advising them on how to identify cases and what action to take if one is suspected. So far the the virus has been found . in chickens and only affected people who have had close contact with the . birds, often at live markets. If it were to become fully adapted to human hosts it could result in a serious worldwide pandemic claiming millions of lives. The 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic - the worst flu pandemic in modern history - killed up to 80 million people worldwide and is believed to have originated in birds. Research is ongoing into how the virus is behaving and what makes it so virulent. The virus has infected people of all age groups, from two to 81, suggesting that humans have no natural immunity to it. So far 20 per cent of victims have died, 20 per cent are recovering and the rest remain ill. In fatal cases, the virus has triggered sepsis - a massive inflammatory response - leading to multiple organ failure. Leading British expert Professor Peter . Openshaw, director of the Centre for Respiratory Infection at Imperial . College London, said: 'This is a very, very serious disease in those who . have been infected. So if this were to become more widespread it would . be an extraordinarily devastating outbreak. The bird flu virus is mutating rapidly and already has two of five genetic changes believed to be necessary for human-to-human transmission . 'It's very unusual to see more than 100 new cases in a very short time period. I think it's definitely something we need to be concerned about.' Scientists have learned lessons from the H5N1 bird flu strain which also emerged in China, and since 2003 has led to 628 confirmed cases in 15 countries and 374 deaths. With a 60 per cent mortality rate, H5N1 is even more deadly than the new strain. Luckily it has not yet shown any sign of making the jump to human-to-human transmission. Although there is no reason to think that H7N9 will acquire this ability any time soon, it already displays some degree of human adaptation. In H5N1, five key genetic changes were identified that scientists believe are needed for the virus to become a potential pandemic threat. Laboratory studies have revealed two of . these mutations in H7N9. One of them is integral to the 'H7' part of its . structure and enables the virus to latch onto certain receptor . molecules in the human respiratory tract. It is seen even when the virus . is confined to chickens. British experts today warned against the mistake of assuming it was a far-away foreign problem . The other has only been acquired after human infection and helps the virus to replicate inside cells. How easy or difficult it might be for the other three changes to occur, and to what extent H7N9 needs the same mutations as H5N1 to pass between humans, is unknown. 'There are hallmarks of human adaptation in the virus,' said Professor Wendy Barclay, chairwoman of influenza virology at Imperial College London. 'What that means is that the virus is mutating rapidly still and acquiring selective adaptive mutations when it crosses into people.' Although H7N9 readily infects chickens, . and probably wild birds, it does not kill them - unlike H5N1. This makes . it extremely difficult to track and hinders attempts to reduce the . chances of human infection. One previous outbreak of an 'H7' flu . strain was recorded in the Netherlands in 2003. However this was a very . different sub-type of virus, since it caused non-fatal eye infections. A teacher guides a student on how to use disinfectant in a junior high school in Taipei, Taiwan . Dr John Watson, head of respiratory diseases at Public Health England, the body that has taken over from the Health Protection Agency, said it was important not to assume there was no threat to the UK. 'It might be tempting to feel, fine, let's just sit back and wait,' he said. 'We feel it's important nevertheless to be taking this very seriously, because of the illness that it's caused, because of the novelty, and because of the possibilities there are about what it does next.' An ever present possibility is someone importing the virus into the UK from China. If a case were confirmed, the patient would have to be isolated and treated quickly. Details of his or her history and contacts with other people would also have to be obtained. The experts pointed out that the virus was sensitive to antiviral drugs such as Tamiflu, stocks of which remained in the UK after the swine flu pandemic of 2009-10. Currently there is no readily available vaccine against the strain.","Virus has taken first steps towards becoming a global threat to humans .

The Police and Crime Commissioner at the centre of the youth tsar fiasco has spent hundreds of thousands of pounds on staff and personal ad campaigns, it emerged yesterday. Ann Barnes has also splashed out £15,000 on a battle bus which she has called 'Ann Force One' – a pun on the name of the US President's plane Air Force One. The 67-year-old former teacher was elected as PCC of Kent in November, despite having previously described the job as a 'wilful waste of public money'. Battle bus: Kent police commissioner Ann Barnes has used the £15,000 bus for an outreach community tour . PCCs, introduced last year, are tasked with creating a police and crime plan and setting their local force budget . Last week Mrs Barnes was humiliated by the resignation of Paris Brown, 17, her £15,000-a-year youth crime tsar, for posting a string of racist and obscene rants on Twitter. Now she is facing calls to quit amid claims she has lost the confidence of voters and police. Humiliated: Miss Barnes' £15,000-a-year youth crime tsar resigned last week following a string of obscene and racist rants on Twitter . Mrs Barnes, who served as chairman of Kent Police Authority from June 2005, initially said the role of PCCs were 'unnecessary'. 'They will have no different or additional powers from the current police authorities and are a wilful waste of public money,' she said. But she performed a U-turn and decided to run for the post. She was elected by only one in ten local people. She received a £65,000-a-year pay rise, taking her salary to £85,000. Despite her comments on squandering public money, Mrs Barnes is using £90,000 of taxpayer funds to hire a chief of staff. She has also recruited two special advisers on £5,900-a-month salaries and is paying a former police authority colleague £300 a day to counsel her. She stood by Miss Brown when the scandal first broke. The teenager had railed against gay people, immigrants and travellers, while glorifying drug-taking and violence. She also used an offensive word for black people, prompting a police probe. Outraged officers criticised Mrs Barnes on the Kent Police Federation Facebook page. One comment read: 'Utterly incredible. I never thought that such a huge gravy train would follow with all that officers are struggling with. How on earth is this equitable and fair?' Former Tory MP Jerry Hayes, a barrister, said: 'She just showed a total lack of judgment, which is rather worrying given she's in charge of governing the police. She's very much on probation.' Mrs Barnes admitted she had no idea how much public money had been spent employing a youth crime tsar. She said: 'I will publish the estimated cost when my staff have researched the figures.'","Police and Crime Commissioner Ann Barnes splashed out £15,000 on a bus .

Snorers who sleep more than nine hours a night are twice as likely to develop bowel cancer than snorers who get seven hours of sleep a night, according to new research. The study showed a significant link between long periods of sleep and the development of colorectal cancer, especially among people who are overweight or who snore. As a result, it is believed that obstructive sleep apnoea – the a form of snoring that causes interrupted breathing during sleep – could contribute to an increased risk of cancer. According to the Harvard study, snoring isn't just annoying it poses serious risks to a person's health . This is because people with sleep apnoea snore and tend to sleep for longer because their sleep is disrupted, making them more tired. ‘Our current study adds to the very limited literature regarding the relationship between sleep duration, sleep quality and colorectal cancer risk,’ said lead author Dr Xuehong Zhang, of the Department of Medicine at Harvard Medical School. ‘The novel observation of increased risk among regular snorers who sleep for long periods raises the possibility that sleep apnoea and its intermittent [oxygen deprivation] may contribute to cancer risk.’ The researchers asked participants to estimate their total hours of sleep in a 24-hour period and asked them if they snore. Of 76,368 women and 30,121 men the researchers documented a total of 1,973 cases of colorectal cancer. They broke the participants into subgroups which showed that men and women who were overweight, or who were regular snorers, and who reported sleeping nine hours or more per day, had a 1.4 to 2-fold increased risk of developing colorectal cancer compared to overweight people, or snorers, who got seven hours sleep a day. The general recommendation is that most adults should get about seven to eight hours of sleep a night. The authors suggest that the association between long sleep duration and colorectal cancer may be explained by obstructive sleep apnoea, which involves repetitive episodes of complete or partial upper airway obstruction during sleep. Sleep apnoea, a dangerous form of snoring, causes tiredness which could explain why some snorers in the study slept too much . The most common cause of obstructive sleep apnoea is excess body weight, and loud snoring is a common symptom of the condition. The researchers believe that sleep disruption caused by sleep apnoea may reduce sleep quality and increase sleepiness, resulting in longer reported sleep durations. In addition to this, intermittent oxygen deprivation, similar to that which occurs in people with sleep apnoea, has been shown in animal models to promote tumour growth. ‘Future studies should focus on different populations and evaluate to see whether sleep duration and sleep quality is a novel risk factor for colorectal cancer and to understand the mechanisms behind this association,’ said Dr Zhang. Other recent research has shown that people who sleep for less than six hours a night are at a significantly increased risk of stroke. Researchers at the University of Alabama found that those in middle age who skimped on sleep were more likely to suffer stroke symptoms than those who got at least nine hours of shut-eye – even if they were a healthy weight and with no family history of stroke. The scientists found that sleep apnea made the problem worse as it reduced the quality of people’s sleep.","Harvard study found that snorers who slept more than 9 hours were at a significantly higher risk of cancer .

Pressure: Jeremy Hunt is facing renewed pressure as senior doctors are 'considering their position' at Lewisham Hospital in South-East London following plans to downgrade its casualty department . Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt faces an unprecedented backlash from GPs who have threatened to quit executive roles over his controversial decision to downgrade a highly successful A&E unit. In what would be the first walkout of its kind, senior GPs could resign over Mr Hunt’s decision last Thursday to disregard their views and turn Lewisham Hospital’s well-regarded casualty department – where 115,000 patients are treated every year – into ‘a tweaked urgent care centre’. It means the most seriously ill patients will now be taken to other hospitals in a bid to divert  Government money from Lewisham, South-East London, to a neighbouring NHS Trust which is in danger of going bankrupt. The Minister has refused to answer questions from The Mail on Sunday about his decision and has ‘gone away for the weekend with his family’, according to a spokeswoman. Mr Hunt has also left behind confusion among doctors and managers as to which services will be left intact at Lewisham, and the threat of a judicial review over his decision. Seven GPs on the executive board of the local Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG), which represents 170 family doctors in the area, are now said to be ‘considering their position’ after claiming their overwhelming opposition to the proposals were ignored by the Minister. Dr Helen Tattersfield, chairwoman of Lewisham CCG, said: ‘There’s a view that if we on the CCG board can’t influence something as important as this then how can we expect to influence anything? It’s a definite option for people, including me, to stand down. Under threat: The most seriously ill patients at Lewisham Hospital, pictured, will now be taken to other hospitals in a bid to divert Government money . fears: Residents and senior doctors have expressed concerns about the changes to the A&E, which treats 115,000 every year . 'Mr Hunt has clearly ignored our position and we have not been listened to at any stage. ‘He wouldn’t speak to us, but instead he was hearing from officials from NHS London and the Department of Health who are keen to produce this kind of result across the capital so were determined to make this work.’ Any resignations would prove highly embarrassing and potentially problematic for Mr Hunt because CCGs are set to take over responsibility for commissioning hospital services from Primary Care Trusts in April. Dr Tattersfield explained: ‘We’ll have an impossible task to control our own budget  because we can’t control where our patients will go for hospital treatment any more. I’ve been asked to do a task which is no longer possible. None of us on the board are prepared to lead an organisation into failure.’ Dr Helen Tattersfield, chairwoman of Lewisham Clinical Commissioning Group said: 'Mr Hunt has clearly ignored our position and we have not been listened to at any stage' Campaigners and Lewisham Council have threatened to launch a judicial review of the decision, supported by Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham. He said the doctors and residents of Lewisham had been ‘treated with contempt’. A spokeswoman for Mr Hunt said it was ‘perfectly legal’ to alter services at the trust. She added: ‘The decision protects the clinical interests of patients in South-East London and helps relieve the burden of historic debt so money can be spent on high quality patient care.’","Protest over downgrading of Lewisham Hospital's casualty department .

"By . Lucy Laing . PUBLISHED: . 12:17 EST, 23 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:12 EST, 24 December 2012 . A young male lion caught in a snare which slowly tightened around his neck as he grew older has been saved after a rescue operation was launched. The lion was first spotted trapped in the snare in Mikumi National park in Tanzania back in 2009 but several attempts to rescue him failed. After three years, the cord had become so tightly wrapped around the lion's neck that he was left unable to hunt and his gaping wound attracted flies and infection. The young animal would soon have been lying in agony in the African bush facing a certain death. But thanks to coverage in the Daily Mail earlier this year, an operation to sedate the lion and remove the snare was launched this summer. Rescued: The lion, which was first spotted trapped in the snare in 2009, was finally free by rangers in the Mikumi National Park in Tanzania earlier this year. He has now been pictured in the wild for the first time since being freed (shown above) and appears to be on the road to recovery . Trap: William Mwakilema, chief park warden in Mikumi National Park, Tanzania, pictured holding the snare which was slowly garroting a young lion . The lion was found by park rangers in August and vets managed to sedate him and cut away the electrical wire snare. The lion has now been photographed in the wild for the first time since his ordeal and appears to be recovering with his mane growing back over his neck and shoulders. The rescue ended a three year hell for the lion. As he has grown over the last three years, the wire snare got tighter and tighter around his neck, and began causing a slow agonising death. By the time he was found he was so weak he was unable to hunt, but amazingly he was being kept alive by the love of his brothers and sisters in his pride. They didn’t kill him as often is the fate of weak male lions, but instead the siblings in his pride kept him alive by bringing him back prey they had hunted. William Mwakilema, Chief Park Warden in Mikumi National Park, said: ‘It was a terrible situation for this lion. He was first seen three years ago with the snare around his neck. ‘He had got caught in the snare which poachers usually use for illegally trapping smaller game animals like impala. ‘He had pulled back, taking the snare with him, and it had been left around his neck. Because he had grown in size over the past three years, the snare has got tighter and tighter around his neck, in effect slowly garroting him. It would have been an agonising death for him. ‘Amazingly the rest of the lions in his pride kept him alive by bringing him back food to eat. It is a remarkable show of togetherness.’ The lion’s plight was first spotted by tourists in 2009, but because of the vast size of Mikumi National Park and the varying terrain, it was near impossible for vets to tranquilise him, despite seven attempts over the years. Mr Mwakilema said: ‘Rangers sighted the lion again in October 2010 and up to this year, had on seven occasions attempted to dart the lion but due to the demanding terrain and the lion’s increasing shyness and fear, all of these attempts ended in frustration.’ It is a sight that is growing more common in parts of Africa, as an increasing number of lions fall victim to poaching. Some are wandering by mistake into snares that are meant for other animals such as antelope which are hunted by poachers for bushmeat, but others are being deliberately poached for their body parts. Facing death: The young lion was left trapped in the snare, which got tighter and tighter as he grew, for a total of three years after numerous attempts to rescue him failed . There is now a growing demand for lions claws and bones in parts of the far east for use in traditional medicines. Lions are being hunted more and more as a substitute for tigers - whose body parts have traditionally been used for the Chinese medicine market - as tigers are now so scarce in the wild. A sharp increase in the lion bone trade suggests that lion bones are being swapped for tiger bones used in far eastern medicine. Also the pelts and claws are being used too. Dr Pieter Kat, from LionAid, said: ‘There has been a huge jump recently in the value of lion bones driven by the traditional medicine market, seeing as we have so few tigers.’ Shocking: William Mwakilema, chief park warden at the Mikumi National Park, said that the snare would have caused the lion a 'slow agonising death' if he hadn't been freed . In the 1990’s, 1kg of lion bones were worth just $10, but now that has massively increased to $300 in 2010. The increase in value is reflected in the figures that show the number of lions left in the wild is on a serious decline. There was an estimated 200,000 lions in Africa in the 1960’s. This has dropped to just 23,000- 25,000. Earlier this year, two lions were found dead in Northern Tanzania, with just their claws removed. After the snared lion was spotted and photographed in May, the Daily Mail highlighted his plight. It sparked worldwide concern via the internet, social networking sites and international press. Mr Mwakilema, who has been the Chief Warden since January this year, decided to launch the biggest rescue mission for the lion so far. He mobilised the majority of the 77 park rangers, who carried out an extensive search of the vast area, stretching over 3,200 square kilometres. Mikumi national park is adjoined to the biggest reserve in Africa, Selous Game Reserve, which is a further 50,000 square kilometres - bigger than the entire land area of Denmark. The lions can move freely between the two areas. Safari tourists were also asked to report any sighting of lion and look out for the signs of any neck injuries and to report it straight back to the park authorities. The lion was finally found at the end of August when rangers spotted it among its pride. A vet with a tranquilising rifle was called to the scene. Mr Mwakilema added: ‘This was an extremely dangerous procedure as the other five members of the pride attempted to protect the tranquilised lion. ‘The amount of tranquiliser used was crucial as too little and the lion wouldn’t be subdued -  with the ability to kill a man with one swipe of his paw. Too much could prove fatal. ‘The vet eventually managed to tranquilise him and the rangers drove off the remainder of the pride using their patrol land cruisers. ‘The skin had healed over the snare leaving only some of the wire visible and it required a skilled use of bolt cutters to sever the thick electrical wire cable which was embedded into the flesh.’ Success: After seven failed attempts, rangers managed to sedate the lion and remove the snare from around its neck in August this year. They put a purple antiseptic on the lion's shocking wounds . Delicate operation: The rangers had to be sure to get the amount of sedative given to the lion right as too little and it could have killed one of them with a swipe of its paw, whereas too much would have killed the lion . After releasing the snare a purple antiseptic was applied to the remaining wound and a drug to reverse the transquiliser was given to the lion. Mr Mwakilema, who studied an MSC in Tourism Development at Surrey University, added: ‘This was a massive rescue attempt - bigger than anything ever attempted before. ‘The terrain varies from open plains to dense forests and mountain areas, so it was a difficult area to search. ‘During certain times of years, the grass can be taller than a man, and this was the circumstances when the photographer first took the picture in May. A lion can disappear in this grass, be sitting five feet away from you and can’t be spotted, due to their excellent camouflage.’ ‘Despite all these difficulties we persevered and thankfully managed to free it.’ This November, photographer Gary Roberts who took the original photograph, returned to Mikumi National Park and spent six days photographing lions within the area. On the last night after following a pride he was astonished to see the rescued lion coming out of the darkness. Wounds: Rangers put a purple antiseptic on the lion's wounds in a bid to prevent infection and to help the animal to heal. The lion's skin had grown around the snare . Asleep: The animal pictured lying sedated in the Tanzanian bush. He was eventually revived by rangers who gave him an antidote to reverse the effects of the sedative drug . He was positively identified by park authorities later by matching scar patterns on his face and shoulders. Already the lion had put on weight and was starting finally to grow the mane around his neck and shoulders. Gary Roberts said: ‘He did not emerge to join the pride until well after dark and we were packing up ready to leave for the day. ‘He approached his brothers within the pride and settled down to rest with them. It was a great sight - an end to a harrowing story - and shows that with the cooperation of authorities and the help from the public something can be done to stem the relentless threat of poaching to wildlife worldwide.’ Tanzanian National Park Authorities have anti poaching patrols, but with over 30 per cent of Tanzania’s land set aside for conservation purposes, the area is a large area to police. There are projects such as the SANA Project in Tanzania, set up by the Saadani Safari Lodge, to allow poorer communities to develop whilst protecting the national park areas. It is hoped that projects such as these will help protect and preserve the wildlife for the future. Now: The rescued lion has recently been spotted in the park at night after six days of searching. The wound has started to heal and a mane was growing over his back and shoulders .","Lion first spotted with the snare caught around its neck in Mikumi National park in Tanzania in 2009 .

A stark warning that banks across the European Union need to reduce the size of their debts by an astonishing £1trillion was issued by the International Monetary Fund today. It called on banks across Europe to reduce the reliance on emergency wholesale funds provided by central bank and to rebuild their balance sheet. The failure of European banks to reform is ‘blocking economic recovery’ and starving small and medium sized businesses of vital funds they need to survive. IMF official Jose Vinals was critical of banks in the eurozone which he said were too dependent . Whereas as the United States and Britain moved speedily to reshape their banking systems post the financial crisis the Europeans have been slow to act applying sticking plasters in the shape of emergency cash arrangements provided by the European Central Bank. IMF officials cited Britain as the one country where the reform of the banks was well advanced. It expressed concern, however, that stalled progress in restoring the health of the state controlled banks – Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland – is a drag on the recovery of the British economy. Commenting on its Global Financial Stability Report a top IMF official Jose Vinals said he detected ‘blue skies’ in the global financial system some five years after the financial crash. But while he gave the Americans, the Britain and Japan praise for tackling the issues he was critical of the eurozone for failing to deal with ‘legacy’ issues of the debt build up and strengthening the balance sheets of its banks. He accused banks in the eurozone of having become ‘too dependent’ on the wholesale funds some of which have been provided under guarantee by the European Central Bank. The IMF pressed the case for ‘decisive’ action in Europe if there was to be recovery and this included the establishment of a ‘fully fledged banking union.’ ‘We do not yet have healthy banks,’ the IMF’s top financial analyst said. The IMF expressed concern about the health of the state controlled banks Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland . Although eurozone leaders have pledged themselves to banking union precious little action has been taken as markets have calmed down. Progress also has been halted by the upcoming German elections, the political stalemate in Italy and the worsening shape of the French economy. The Fund officials expressed strong fears that recovery among Europe’s weakest economies, Greece, Spain and Portugal, was being held up by the appalling state of the banking system. ‘Credit is not flowing in the euro area periphery,’ Vinals said. The IMF also expressed concerns that even though the legacy issues of the ‘great recession’ had not yet even though legacy issues of the great recession have not fully been dealt with there are new crises on the horizon. Vinals gave his support to the contentious Cyprus rescue package noting that it was important in bank crises, post the crash, that private holders of bank debts – in Cyprus’s case the large depositors – paid a price as well as the taxpayers. He described the situation in Cyprus as being unique to that country. The Fund expressed concern that now that the banking crisis is all but over in the United States, where it began with the sub-prime meltdown in 2007-2008, that it was already returning to bad habits. Companies and private equity firms were rushing to raise cheap debt for takeovers without making the proper checks or putting in the right safeguards. The IMF is worried that ‘pension funds and insurance companies’ are taking excessive risks. Similarly, the money being printed in the US, Britain and other advances countries is ‘spilling over into emerging markets’ exposing fast growing economies to currency risks and rising debt. This has raised the prospect of volatile capital flows that in turn could lead to currency wars.","The failure of European banks to reform is 'blocking economic recovery'

And 22 years of labour went into constructing the Taj Mahal. But now, you too can achieve the same, in a fraction of the time... out of Lego. Warren Elsmore, one of the very few professional Lego builders in Britain, has designed a series of cityscapes remade in miniature. These include St Basil's Cathedral in Moscow (20,000 bricks); the Taj Mahal (28,000); and the Empire State Building (13,000). Scroll down for video . A miniature version of St Pancras Station and Hotel created out of Lego by Warren Elsmore. It contains 180,000 bricks and is 5ft tall and long . Mr Elsmore's book shows you how to build mini marvels, such as this 20,000-Lego brick version of St Basil's Cathedral in Moscow . The original Taj Mahal, in Agra, India, took 22 years to build. This one should take just several hundred hours . To help fellow enthusiasts, he has written a manual, Brick City: Lego For Grown-Ups - which reveals how to make mini versions of Buckingham Palace, the Eiffel Tower, the Lincoln Memorial and also street scenes of Amsterdam, to name but a few. One of his masterpieces - St Pancras Station and Hotel - was unveiled yesterday and will be on display at Waterstones bookshop in Piccadilly, central London, for a month. The 180,000-brick model is 5ft long and 5ft high - and includes six Eurostar platforms, complete with working trains. The 36-year-old AFOL (that's 'adult fan . of Lego') has even left part of the building exposed to show details . such as commuters running down escalators and a guest in a hotel bath. Warren Elsmore is one of only three or four adults who have a full-time job making structures from Lego. Above, Westminster Abbey . The building, which took 500 hours to make, was a two-year labour of love for Mr Elsmore, who gave up his job as an IT consultant half a year ago. He is now one of only three or four adults who have a full-time job making structures from the plastic bricks. Just last week, Mr Elsmore was paid £1,500 for making an 18in-long corporate logo out of Lego - and charges up to £25,000 for replicas of monumental buildings, such as the Petronas Towers of Kuala Lumpur. Not bad for 300 hours' work. A street scene in Amsterdam. Mr Elsmore sometimes pops down to Argos to buy his plastic coloured bricks . And if you're wondering where he buys the materials to create his intricate artworks, the answer is simple. 'I buy my Lego from the same outlets as you do. Occasionally I pop down to Argos,' he told the Daily Telegraph. Another source he uses is bricklink.com - an online marketplace where people trade around 200million different types of Lego parts. As well as long-term projects geared towards adults, Mr Elsmore's book also caters for children. His guide shows how a 10-year-old can make a red London telephone box, Hong Kong junk or New York taxi in about an hour. And the key to thinking the Lego way? Imagination. 'The only restriction is your imagination. You really can build anything you like,' he said. Brick City: Lego for Grown-Ups is published by Mitchell Beazley.

Attacked: An Afghan man whose legs and hands were allegedly chopped by Taliban militants receives medical treatment at a local hospital in Herat, Afghanistan today . 'These two men are from Koshk Robat Sangi district. They were caught by the Taliban. Each of them have lost one hand and one leg,' said Noor Khan Nekzad, spokesman for the Herat police. The attack on the two men was today followed by two more assaults by Taliban insurgents, making April the deadliest month in Afghanistan this year with 222 people killed in violent actions. Militants shot dead six police officers at a checkpoint in the Dayak district of Ghazni province, wounding one and leaving one missing, said deputy police chief Colonel Mohammad Hussain. The second attack hit Paktika province where a suicide bomber killed three and wounded seven, including two police officers, in a shopping bazaar. Zabiullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban, claimed responsibility for the attack. Illegal court: The unnamed man and his colleague were caught and charged in a Taliban court which found them 'guilty' of working with NATO . Victim: Taliban militants allegedly chopped off a hand and a leg each of the two men because they are employed by a company that provides logistics for NATO convoys . Reflecting the surge in violence, the Afghanistan NGO Safety Office reported today that insurgent-initiated attacks increased by 47 per cent during the first quarter of 2013, compared to the same period last year. Afghanistan's Defence Ministry said the Afghan army carried out 2,209 military operations during a month-long period ending today. During that time, 467 insurgents and 107 soldiers were killed, and 362 militants were arrested. The Taliban broke off formal talks with NATO last year and have steadfastly rejected negotiations with the Afghan government, which they view as acting under instructions from allied nations. Afghanistan has about 100,000 international troops, including 66,000 from the United States.","Two men captured and charged in Taliban court for working with NATO .

A crooked registrar faces a lengthy jail sentence after being found guilty of issuing false birth certificates to a gang of African fraudsters who stole at least £4million from taxpayers  over 20 years. Azu Akpom provided fake certificates to the ringleader of the gang who went on to create false identities for up to 100 children to milk the benefits system. Croydon Crown Court heard how the  Nigerian-born father of three was ultimately trapped by a text message which, despite his denial, showed he knew the gang’s  chief conspirator, Ugandan-born Ruth Nabuguzi, 49. Last year the same court heard how she was at the centre of the scam which also saw her claim to be suffering from HIV and needing costly drugs – yet in reality she sent them back to Uganda to be sold for huge profits. Supplying the drugs for so many years cost the taxpayer more than £2million. The gang exploited false identities in the fraud relating to accommodation and sub-letting of flats at a cost of £650,000, and various benefits totalling £900,000. This week 46-year-old Akpom’s role in the scam was exposed as prosecutor Paul Raudnitz told the jury: ‘This case revolves around the making of false identities for children and Azu Akpom as a registrar was at the centre of helping make those identities. ‘While he denies any knowledge of knowing Ruth Nabuguzi there is an incriminating text message directly from his mobile phone to hers which was found by the investigating authorities. ‘These certificates enabled the gang to make numerous false claims for both child benefits and child tax credits and other allowances.’ The court heard how Akpom started to work for the Borough of Newham in East London in 2004 before becoming a registrar in 2006 and a senior registrar a year later. He was later introduced to  Nabuguzi and her gang and began providing false birth certificates for use in their long-running conspiracy. As a registrar, he had a duty to request confirmation of a birth, with an NHS number from the hospital where the child had supposedly been born. Instead, he simply filled out birth certificates after being given names by the gang. Guilty as charged: Mr Akpom was found guilty of aiding the £4million benefits fraud at Croydon Crown Court . Staff became suspicious and Akpom became the subject of an internal investigation while the UK Border Agency and police investigated Nabuguzi and her gang. When she and fellow gang members were arrested in September 2011 a ‘kit bag for fraud’ containing documents and birth certificates was found. These included five issued by Akpom for false identities – all supposedly ‘born’ earlier that year. A text from his phone to one of Nabuguzi’s six mobiles read: ‘Just remember if anyone asks anything about you and me deny that you know me. I don’t know anyone too . . . so they have nothing.’ Investigators were unable to discover how much Akpom, from Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, had been paid by the gang. Investigated: The Rev Nathan Ntege . A vicar believed to have conducted a string of fake marriage ceremonies appeared in court yesterday. The Rev Nathan Ntege, 53, is alleged to have presided over a number of sham weddings involving suspected illegal immigrants between December 2009 and March 2011. The Church of England clergyman and his 79-year-old verger Brian Miller are said to have organised the sham marriages at the St Jude with St Aidan church in Thornton Heath, South London. Ntege, who wore a dog collar under his suit while in the dock at Croydon Crown Court, faces one specimen charge of conspiring to facilitate unlawful marriage and 13 charges of assisting illegal entry into the UK. An investigation by the UK Border Agency’s Criminal and Financial Investigation Unit, which saw Ntege’s church searched for evidence, led to his arrest in June 2011. His address was not read out in court but it is thought that he lives in a house attached to the church. Miller, from Selsdon, Croydon, was arrested in November 2011. Ntege was bailed yesterday and  a plea hearing was scheduled for March 22. The number of alleged sham ceremonies was not mentioned at yesterday’s preliminary hearing. In 2010 the Rev Alex Brown was jailed for presiding over 360 fake weddings in Hastings, in what the Crown Prosecution Service described at the time as the biggest sham marriage case it had seen. Nabuguzi claimed HIV/AIDS drugs costing £2,280,000. She also received £500,000 in housing benefit from Newham Council. She came to the UK in 1991 and claimed asylum for herself and four ‘children’. Three years later, she used a different name to apply  again – with two more ‘children’. In 1999, using yet another name, she applied once more for asylum, this time with three ‘children’. She is believed to have regularly travelled back to Uganda and bought at least three properties there. In November she was jailed for six years while the rest of her gang received sentences totalling 19 years between them. Akpom denied misconduct in a judicial or public office and five counts of fraud but it took the jury only 90 minutes to find him guilty of all six charges. The judge refused his request to be allowed to go home before sentencing next week to see his family. He was remanded in custody and refused bail. Recorder Freya Newbery told Akpom: ‘The unique feature of this case is serious misconduct while in public office and abuse of trust and that is particularly serious.’ The maximum sentence misconduct in a judicial or public office is life imprisonment.","Azu Akpom, 46, provided fake birth certificates to create 100 'false children'

David Cameron needs to start behaving less like a ‘public school toff’ and more like Nigel Farage, his former Tory council leader warned yesterday. In a stinging open letter, Keith Mitchell said the ‘out of touch’ Prime Minister needed to reconnect with the public in order to reverse the rise of Mr Farage’s UKIP. Mr Mitchell – leader of Oxfordshire County Council until he stood down last week – also said grassroots activists were ‘close to extinction’. Polls apart: UKIP Leader Nigel Farage (left) smokes a cigarette and drinks a pint of beer while David Cameron (right) has been told he needs to start behaving less like a 'public school toff' In the letter posted on his blog, Mr Mitchell said the Tories’ woes were not all about policy, or even Europe. He said the Tory leadership needed to change its style – urging Mr Cameron and others to take a leaf out of Mr Farage’s book. ‘I am afraid the UKIP leader has a style and a manner of speaking that connects with ordinary mortals much better than professional politicians,’ he said. ‘He is unafraid to be filmed with a pint of beer and a cigarette in his hand when all of our media training tells us to eschew either image. ‘He also uses soundbites that appeal to Conservatives.’ His warning came as figures revealed UKIP enjoyed a 51 per cent surge in members during the past 12 months, with many of them defecting from the Conservative Party. Keith Mitchell, leader of Oxfordshire County Council until he stood down last week, said the 'out of touch' Prime Minister needed to reconnect with the public in order to reverse the rise of Mr Farage¿s UKIP . Membership of the anti-EU party surged from 17,220 to 26,097 in the year to April. Conservative Party membership is thought to have fallen to around 130,000 from a peak under Mr Cameron of more than 400,000. Some MPs say they have lost more than a quarter of their members in the last year alone. In words aimed at the Prime Minister, Mr . Mitchell added: ‘You and George [Osborne], in particular, have been . portrayed as public school toffs. Mr Mitchell said Mr Cameron and George Osborne have been portrayed as public school toffs` ‘You have to work out how to be one of us without affectation or silly gimmicks and to speak the language of Joe Public. ‘I understand how hard this is and the conflicting pressures on you, but people want a clearer and stronger style of leadership that speaks the language of conviction and leadership.’ He said Mr Cameron had the ‘capacity’ to lead the Tories to victory, but added: ‘It will take the charisma of Churchill and the conviction of Thatcher to deliver’. And he urged Mr Cameron to be ‘clearer about the limitations of coalition’ and spell out areas where the Liberal Democrats were blocking reform. Meanwhile, Tory MPs spent more than an hour grilling party chairman Grant Shapps last night over the Conservatives’ failure against UKIP. Many told ministers it was essential to take a tougher line on an EU referendum. MPs are pushing Mr Cameron to support backbench proposals for legislation this year, enshrining in law his pledge to hold a referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU in 2017. In a further blow last night it emerged that Mr Cameron is struggling to build the support in Europe needed to block a £9.5billion increase in this year’s EU budget. Brussels sources said he faced defeat as early as next week in a vote which will cost the UK an extra £769million. Chancellor Mr Osborne was urged to ignore ‘siren calls’ to change course on the economy last night as IMF inspectors flew in to rake over Britain’s finances. The plea from business leaders came as unions warned the Coalition’s austerity drive had led to ‘a lost decade for growth’. The IMF is expected to reiterate warnings that the Coalition’s strategy to cut debt is too aggressive and hinders recovery. Nadine Dorries: In from the cold . Outspoken MP Nadine Dorries has been welcomed back into the Conservative Party fold after almost half a year in exile – amid fears she would defect to UKIP. Mrs Dorries was suspended from the party last year for competing in ITV’s reality TV show, I’m a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!, in Australia. She also drew the wrath of government whips when she described David Cameron and George Osborne as ‘arrogant posh boys who don’t know the price of milk’. But she was reinstated as a Tory MP yesterday after apologising for swapping Westminster for the jungle during parliamentary term time. Her acceptance back into Conservative ranks follows  a weekend of speculation that she was about to be lured  to UKIP. Leader Nigel Farage this weekend signalled he would take Mrs Dorries into his party if the Conservatives did not, warning: ‘Cameron’s loss would be our gain.’ Sources close to Mr Osborne last night insisted he had no problem with Mrs Dorries being re-admitted into the party and had not held any grudges against her. She told the Daily Mail: ‘I am delighted to be back in the fold. The Whip has been restored with no conditions other than those which apply to any MP. Work continues  as normal.’","Keith .

A Lib Dem spokesman said: ‘The police said it would be better if we suspended our investigation. Probe: The party has confirmed police are to investigate claims made against Lord Rennard .

Frustrated villagers fed up with drivers careering through a dangerous ford have put up a blunt sign warning ‘idiots with twattnavs, meet thy doom’. Those behind the unofficial tin sign say impatient drivers regularly ignore warning notices and instead follow their Sat Nav directions through the ford – even when it is several feet high with water. They came up with the unique deterrent following numerous vehicle rescues. Frustrated villager erected the blunt sign following a number of rescues from the ford . Hampshire Country Council is considering closing the ford in Headly because of the danger caused by drivers who refuse to turn back down the narrow country lane and risk crossing the water. Simon Hiscock, who owns a smallholding nearby has had to rescue dozens of motorists from the ford through the River Enborne, where closure signs regularly disappear. He said: ‘There are big red signs saying road closed and there are barriers, but people are driving through it. ‘People are leaving the plastic barriers flat in the road and driving across them.’ He said villagers had seen several motorists driving through the ford recently, even when the river was several feet higher than usual following heavy rain. ‘There were two people's cars stuck in the ford last week’ he added. The ford, which straddles the Hampshire-Berkshire border in Thornford Road, was closed in April after a man died while trying to drive through the ford. It is due to remain shut for 18 months - and might even be sealed off permanently, the county council has said. The ford has been the site of numerous rescues in the past. Floods can cause the river - normally just a few inches deep - to rise to more than six feet. Many drivers have been rescued after ignoring the warning signs not to cross the ford after heavy rain . The ford often floods but many drivers ignore the warnings, refusing to turn back down the country lane . Headley parish council chairman Barrie Hiscock said the ideal option would be to ‘completely seal it off for all time’, but conceded that it might pose problems for local farmers who rely on it to get tractors and heavy machinery to their fields. Problems have been made worse by roadworks on the busy A339 Newbury to Basingstoke road, which has led to impatient drivers using the lane where the ford is located as a rat run to get round the congestion. A Hampshire county council spokesman said they plan to install larger barriers. He added: ‘Although the local highways team inspect the barriers at the ford regularly they cannot monitor them 24 hours a day. ‘We recognise that the closure will cause some people inconvenience by having to drive around the traffic diversion routes, but it is important to maintain the safety of the travelling public.’ Paul Coates, of Hampshire Fire and Rescue, said: ‘These fords we class as very dangerous because of the force of the water...six inches of water can lift a car. ‘Even if you get your car through the water can damage your engine, you're potentially going to get a big bill and the insurance company won't pay it. Don't go through it, turn around.’","Villagers erected sign following numerous rescues at the ford in Hampshire .

Apple is believed to be about to start manufacturing the iPhone 5S, the latest version of its hugely successful handset. Foxconn, the Chinese manufacturer that has made previous versions, is believed to have been hiring 10,000 workers a week since March for the production lines that will produce it. The handset is expected to go on sale in the autumn, and Apple is also believed to be developing a cheaper version. Customers queue up to purchase the iPhone 5 smartphone at the Apple flagship store on George Street in Sydney, Australia. The firm is believed to be preparing to unveil the next version in the summer. Apple's next two iPhones had already been designed before Steve Jobs died in October 2011, it has been claimed. At a meeting with the San Francisco . district attorney, George Gascón, who is keen to cut phone thefts in the . region, Apple's liaison officer Michael Foulkes is reported by the San . Francisco Examiner to have said the designs for the next two phones . 'preceded Tim Cook [being chief executive]'. 'We have been very busy recently as we will start mass-producing the new . iPhone soon,' a Zhengzhou-based Foxconn executive told the Wall Street Journal. The company has more than 1.4 million workers in China, according to the report. It typically . adjusts staffing according to the electronics production cycle, for . which demand usually picks up in the second quarter after a . traditionally slow start to the year. The . new model is believed to look identical to the current iPhone 5 but . include a faster processor and updated camera, according to online . reports. It will also run iOS 7, a major new version of Apple's iPad and iPhone software being overseen by Apple's Sir Jonathan Ive. Earlier this month it was reported Apple had hit major delays with its flagship iOS software due to a radical new look and feel. Experts say engineers have had to be pulled from its Mac software group so the new version can be finished in time for a rumoured summer launch. Sir Jonathan was given responsibility for the software earlier this year after the company fired Scott Forstall in a move believed to be related to the firm's huge problems with its Maps app. 'What I've heard: iOS 7 is running behind, and engineers have been pulled from OS X 10.9 to work on it' said John Gruber of the Apple blog Daring Fireball. He also claimed engineers working on the project had been given special handsets. 'Word on the street is that iOS engineers with carry privileges all have some sort of polarizing filter on their iPhone displays, such that it greatly decreases viewing angles, thus making it difficult for observers to see the apparently rather significant system-wide UI overhaul.'

'As . word of the earlier production schedule starts to spread, we believe we . could see a slight slowing of demand CQ1 in anticipation of the new . product launch and Apple will likely start curtailing channel . inventory,' he was quoted as saying by StreetInsider.

Labour’s local election results were described as worse than those achieved under Michael Foot in 1981 – two years before he led the party to a crushing general election defeat. Ed Miliband insisted he was ‘pleased’ with the polls, which saw Labour win an additional 291 seats, reversing some of the losses made when the councils were last contested, under Gordon Brown in 2009. However, experts noted that the figures did not represent the gains normally achieved by a party on the march to power. Michael Foot led the Labour Party to a crushing defeat in 1983, after he had disappointing local election results . Labour gained control of just two councils: Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire, which it lost in 2009. It failed to take back Lancashire and Staffordshire, which were also lost four years ago, or Cumbria, another key target. There were few signs of a revival in the south of England. Education Secretary Michael Gove said the results were worse than those achieved in 1981, when Labour won Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire, Lancashire, Staffordshire and Cumbria as it picked up almost 1,000 seats. Its projected share of the vote was 41 per cent then, compared with 29 per cent this week. Mr Gove said: ‘When Michael Foot was leader of the Opposition they won Staffordshire, Cumbria and Lancashire. They are not winning them now. Ed Miliband said he was 'pleased' with the polls, despite only gaining two councils . ‘What is really striking is that people are not voting for Labour in anything like the numbers they need to be on course for government.’ A Labour source said it was ‘ludicrous’ to compare yesterday’s result with 1981, when the UK Independence Party was not a factor – but Labour’s grassroots found little to cheer. Mark Ferguson, editor of the LabourList website, said: ‘I can safely say that today’s results are not the boost that Ed Miliband hoped for.’ George Eaton, of New Statesman magazine,  agreed that the failure to reverse the losses of 2009 was deeply disappointing. ‘Labour needs to be performing much better if it’s to stand a chance of governing alone after 2015,’ he said. John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University, added: ‘The scale of progress, in truth, will disappoint the party. Labour’s share of the vote was up by 8 per cent on 2009, but still 5 per cent below the result in 2005 when they won the general election.’ Nevertheless, Mr Miliband said the party had performed well in spite of UKIP’s surge. ‘There are still lots of people saying: “Can anyone turn this country around?”’ he said. ‘I believe Labour can.’ The results come after a difficult month for Mr Miliband, whose poll lead over the Tories has halved amid public concern over his soft stance on key issues. His opposition to the popular cap on benefits has been particularly controversial. Similarly, despite lobbying from senior figures including Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, the Labour leader is against a referendum on Europe – making the party’s disaffected voters a target for UKIP. Labour insisted yesterday that it had done well in target seats such as Lincoln, Harlow, Stevenage, Loughborough, Crawley and Cannock Chase, crucial battlegrounds for the next election. A source said: ‘This shows we are well on the way to victory in 2015.’ The Labour leader is against a referendum on Europe making the party's disaffected voters a target for UKIP and Nigel Farage . Labour received an unexpected victory in Witney Central, the heart of Prime Minister David Cameron's constituency . Labour was also cheered by an unexpected victory in Witney Central, at the heart of David Cameron’s constituency, where a strong UKIP showing pushed the Conservatives into third. Anti-Coalition sentiment also hurt the Liberal Democrats, who lost more than a quarter of their council seats. It suffered the worst losses of the three major parties and came seventh in the South Shields by-election. Across the 34 councils holding local elections, the Lib Dems lost 124 seats and were left with 352 – a loss of 26 per cent. However, the party insisted it remains strong in the areas where it has MPs. Nick Clegg’s party had hoped to make gains in areas such as the south-west where Tory support is flagging. However, it lost out to UKIP in Somerset, Devon, Hampshire and West Sussex. It did, however, make gains in Cumbria, Wiltshire, Gloucestershire and Shropshire. Mr Clegg said: ‘Of course, it is not good to lose hard-working councillors, but the Liberal Democrats are on a journey. ‘We are on a journey from a party of protest to a party of government, and actually the pattern that has emerged shows that, where we have MPs, where we have Liberal Democrats out on the doorstep setting out our side to the story, communicating our message, we are holding our own and in some areas making gains.’","Labour's election result were as bad as Michael Foot in 1981 .

A student posed as an online buyer to lure the owners of Rolex and Cartier watches into armed robberies, a court heard yesterday. Well-spoken Lauren Lafayette-Ede made appointments to view the watches after spotting them on auction websites eBay and Gumtree. But she was merely acting as a front for a pair of robbers armed with Uzi sub-machine guns and Tasers. Lauren Lafayette-Ede, 20, targeted people trying . to sell their valuables online. She would visit their home and leave . the door open for the gang. One man was attacked at gunpoint in Kensal . Rise, north-west London after offering to sell his Hublot Big Bang watch . for £5,500 (left); another for his £8,800 Rolex Daytona (right) When it malfunctioned, giving him only a ‘light tickling sensation’, the others threatened Javed Ali’s family at gunpoint. On another occasion, Christopher Mills was threatened with a gun at his home in Kensal Rise, north London, after offering to sell his Hublot Bing Bang watch for £5,500. A week later, the robbers held an Uzi to the head of doctor Dominque Wong-Ahkye at his home and demanded his £8,800 Rolex Daytona watch. Lafayette-Ede, who was 19 at the time of the robberies, was yesterday described in court as the ‘acceptable face’ of the plot. Her lawyer told Snaresbrook Crown Court in north-east London, that she became involved because of the ‘unhealthy relationship she had with Mr Gregg-Ball’. Sentencing her to four years in a young offenders’ institution, Judge John Lafferty said: ‘Before these offences took place you were doing all that society asked of you. You were a hard-working, decent, honest young woman, well on your way to the kind of future that would have made your parents proud and given you a rich and rewarding life. ‘But you fell under the influence of Mr Gregg-Ball, and that is where this criminality springs from.‘I don’t accept that you were placed under any real pressure, other than the pressure you placed on yourself to keep your boyfriend happy.’ Lafayette-Ede, with boyfriend Rhys Gregg-Ball 20, found the jewellery sellers on eBay and Gumtree . The robbery spree ended when the 17-year-old accomplice tried to rob Hannah Hatt, 33, of her £1,900 diamond ring which she had advertised on Gumtree. During the raid, Miss Hatt, a project manager, and her boyfriend James Smith, 31, managed to overpower the robber and held him until the police arrived. Judge Lafferty awarded Miss Hatt and Mr Smith £500 each for stopping ‘a highly organised and dangerous conspiracy to rob people’. Gregg-Ball, of Sydenham, south London; Lafayette-Ede, of Ramsgate, Kent; and the 17-year-old youth, of Lewisham, south London, all admitted conspiracy to rob. Gregg-Ball was earlier jailed for eight years and the 17-year-old was sent to a young offenders’ institution for five years. David Kitson, defending Lafayette-Ede, said: ‘She did these things because of her need to remain involved in the unhealthy relationship she had with Mr Gregg-Ball. She does deeply regret becoming involved.’","Lauren Lafayette-Ede, 20, from Ramsgate, Kent, contacted victims under aliases of 'Lucy' and 'Imogen'

The British government has started negotiations to compensate thousands of Kenyans who claim they were subjected to appalling abuse by colonial authorities during the 1950s' Mau Mau uprising. The historic talks could mark the first compensation settlement resulting from official crimes committed under imperial rule, at a cost of millions of pounds to taxpayers. It could also lead to claims from other former colonies, such as British Guiana (now Guyana) in South America, and Swaziland in southern Africa. The Foreign Office (FCO) had originally said the Kenyan government was legally responsible for any mistreatment as all liabilities were transferred to the Kenyan Republic when it formed in 1963 as Britain pulled out of Africa. The British government has started negotiations to compensate thousands of Kenyans who claim they were subjected to appalling abuse by colonial authorities during the 1950s' Mau Mau uprising.

Wambuga Wa Nyingi, left, Paulo Muoka Nzili and Jane Muthoni Mara, right, claim they were victims of torture during the Mau Mau uprising in the 1950s . But attempts by government lawyers to prevent elderly survivors of prison camps having their cases heard in British courts were scuppered after the discovery in 2011 of a huge archive of colonial documents which the FCO had kept hidden for decades. Among the 8,000 documents - located at a repository in Hanslope Park, Buckinghamshire - are accounts, written by colonial officials, of prisoners being 'roasted alive'. Removed from Kenya on the cusp of independence, the paperwork was uncovered in January of that year after five Kenyans launched a lawsuit against the British government. The claimants said they suffered castration, sexual abuse and severe beatings in detention camps administered by the British government and wanted an apology and financial compensation. The secret papers revealed that during the Mau Mau rebellion - which saw tens of thousands die between 1952-60 - senior colonial officials authorised . appalling mistreatment of inmates held at the prison camps. The documents also show that officials in London knew about the brutal actions of the detention regime. As details of the talks began to . emerge last week, the FCO said it accepted the . need to discuss Britain's past role. 'It is an enduring . feature of our democracy that we are willing to learn from our history,' an FCO spokesman told the Guardian. As many as 10,000 former prisoners could receive compensation. Although . the individual amounts will vary greatly, the total compensation is . likely to run into tens of millions of pounds. The FCO said that it . would be 'inappropriate' to discuss the talks. But in a prepared statement, it added: 'We understand the pain and grievance felt by those, . on all sides, who were involved in the divisive and bloody events of the . Emergency period in Kenya. 'It is right that those who feel they have a . case are free to take it to the courts. 'Our relationship with Kenya . and its people has moved on and is characterised by close co-operation . and partnership, building on the many positives from our shared . history."" Among the claimants are Wambugu Wa . Nyingi, 84, Paulo Muoka Nzili, 85, and Jane Muthoni Mara, 73,  who were . held in detention camps during the 1950s. Last October, the High Court rejected the . Government’s claim that too much time had elapsed for there to be a . fair trial, with Mr Justice McCombe finding the three Kenyans had . ‘arguable cases in law’. The Foreign Office originally said the Kenyan government was legally responsible for any mistreatment as all liabilities were transferred to the Kenyan Republic when it formed in 1963 as Britain pulled out of Africa. Above, men of The Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers check the identity of Africans during a raid in Nairobi in 1952 . They claimants said they were subjected to ‘appalling abuse’, including castration, beatings and sexual assaults. Nyingi said he was detained on Christmas Eve 1952 and imprisoned for nine years. He added that he was suspended by his feet and beaten unconscious in an incident in which 11 men were clubbed to death. He also claims cold water was poured on his face to stop him breathing. It was not until the Kenyan government lifted the ban on the Mau Mau in 2002 that survivors started to consider legal action. And it took another six years before . they asked the high court in London for permission to sue the British . government for damages. Juan Mendez, the United Nations' special rapporteur on torture, has called on the . government to 'provide full redress to the victims, including fair and . adequate compensation'. Along with two other former rapporterurs, he wrote: 'In our view, the response of the . British government to vulnerable and elderly victims of (acknowledged) British torture is shameful.' Last month, the FCO told the . claimants' lawyers, Leigh Day, that it wished to adjourn the appeal and . start negotiating a settlement.","Could mark first compensation settlement resulting from official crimes committed under imperial rule .

A former Harrods dressmaker has told how her husband died after NHS 111 call centre workers failed to recognise the urgency of his condition. Barbara Foster called the controversial helpline last Wednesday evening after Reg, her husband of 33 years, developed severe abdominal pains. But staff who took the call wrongly categorised his case as 'not life-threatening' and the ambulance took more than three hours to arrive. Barbara and Reginald Foster, pictured on holiday in Spain last year. Reg, 64, died of an aortic aneurysm after having to wait an hour for an ambulance after they used the NHS 111 phone line . Mr Foster, 64, was eventually taken to the London Chest hospital where he later died from a cardiac arrest. He had been suffering from a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, a tear to one of the major blood vessels which causes internal bleeding. Although the condition has a high mortality rate, survival chances are far better the sooner a patient is given surgery to repair the tear. If Mrs Foster, 73, had spoken  to a doctor or nurse rather than a call centre worker, they may have realised the urgency of his illness, especially given his medical history. He suffered from high blood pressure – which would have put him at higher risk from an aneurism – and had undergone bypass surgery following a major heart attack in 2002. With hindsight, Mrs Foster, from Hornchurch, Essex, regrets not calling 999 straight away. She says she called 111 shortly before 8pm but an ambulance did not arrive until after 11pm. (File picture) The ambulance took more than three hours to arrive after staff who took the call wrongly categorised Mr Foster's case as 'not life-threatening' She said: 'I kept walking down the drive to see if anything was coming. Reg said, “don't bother them Babs, there's probably people more urgent than me”.' After waiting almost an hour she dialled 999. 'They said, “You're on the list and an ambulance will get to you as soon as we've got one free”,' Mrs Foster said. This is because the case had been classed as 'non-life-threatening' by 111 staff. 'They told me they had got a lot of urgent cases. That's when I said I said I think he is an emergency. He was rolling backwards and forwards in severe pain. 'I just knew he was going to die.' Mrs Foster's ordeal will prompt concerns that members of the public have been left confused as to whether to dial 999 or NHS 111. At one point, Mrs Foster, a grandmother of two, said she was told off by the woman NHS 111 call centre worker for 'not listening'. She said: 'I needed her to speak up a bit as she was so quiet. She said, “You're not listening to me.” I thought she was quite rude.' Neither the area's NHS organisation Havering Clinical Commissioning group, nor the firm running 111 there were available for comment. There are concerns 111, which  has replaced NHS Direct and  local out-of-hours GP numbers,  is putting lives at risk. A survey of 748 GPs and hospital doctors by Doctors.net found 70 per cent  want it scrapped completely,  while another 16 per cent say it should be withdrawn until problems are fixed. Jane Cummings, chief nursing officer from NHS England, said: 'The vast majority of patients who use NHS 111 are getting a good service, although it is clear that some are not and this is unacceptable.'","Barbara Foster called the controversial helpline last Wednesday evening .

A parking sensor promoted as tool to help drivers find free spaces could also enable traffic wardens to dish out more fines. Motoring organisations have warned the Metereye system could help wardens make a beeline to vehicles that have overstayed a parking space. The Metereye technology, developed by Scottish company, Town and City Parking (TCP), works by transmitting signls from a sensor placed on the floor of a parking bay. Helping hand: Motoring organisations have warned the Metereye system could enable wardens to identify vehicles which have overstayed a parking space . The senor records the vehicle arriving, its occupancy and departure date. It then transmits this information in real time to a handheld electronic device. The system is aimed at parking companies rather than the public, but some local authorities are championing the technology as a tool for drivers to find free spaces quickly. More...

Vintage car once good enough for SamCam sparks bidding war at auction - fetching three times its value . Metereye is already being used by Westminster council, which has created a dedicated app to help drivers find free parking spaces in the borough. Park Right, available on smart phones and iPads, picks up the same signals emitted from the Metereye parking sensors. Edinburgh city council is also using the technology, while other . local authorities, retailers and a major sports stadium have also . expressed an interest in the system, the manufacturer has said. Smart: The Metereye technology beams a signal from a sensor (pictured) under the road just before a space becomes free . The Metereye sensor unit is based around an 'infrared Vehicle Detection System'. When placed on the floor of a parking bay, the sensor records the vehicle arriving, its occupancy and departure date. It then transmits this information in real time to a handheld electronic device. Using the data, a traffic warden can make a note of the time the car arrived at the bay and what time it left - or should have left. TCP calls Metereye a 'simple, cost effective way to monitor usage of car parking bays,' on its website. It . also extolls the benefits of the handheld technology where one parking . attendant 'can be responsible for two or three sites at the same time.' While local authorities have championed the technology for . drivers, they have been less vocal about its potential for traffic . wardens. A move that has angered motoring organisations. Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, told the Daily Telegraph: 'This gives wardens the equivalent of eyes in the backs of their heads. 'The all-knowing equipment will be good for the parking industry and in car parks where space is at a premium. 'But some drivers might ask, where's the sense of fair play? Motorists will hope it won't encourage attendants to lie in wait for people who have only slightly overstayed their welcome.' Councils in England and Wales made more than half a billion pounds profit from parking in 2010/2011, according to official figures. Lewis Johnson, a data analyst with Westminster council, told a computer magazine that the Metereye technology could be used to identify streets which have heavy parking use before raising charges accordingly. He said: 'It is likely to confirm drivers' suspicions that this sort of technology favours Big Brother rather than the motorist, despite what the councils say.'","Metereye technology beams signal from .

Mr Gilroy, who had confronted the gang of teenagers about their unruly behaviour, said after they fled the bus by triggering the emergency door release, the driver apologised claiming he wasn’t allowed to leave his cab for health and safety reasons. Bus service: Grandfather Fred Gilroy, 68, was attacked just feet away from the driver's protected cab on the First 636 service in Bradford (file picture) A local councillor has joined the pensioner in demanding that bus company First does more to protect passengers. A First spokesman said: 'We would urge anyone with information to go to the police to help catch these vile individuals.

Mr Gilroy had been travelling on the upper deck of the 636 service in Bradford, West Yorkshire when a group of about five teenagers started misbehaving on the back seat. He said a First staff member in uniform came upstairs to confront them but after being verbally abused backed off and a short time later left the bus. Mr Gilroy was then shot in the ear with a pellet gun. He went downstairs to speak to the driver, who pulled over, but the yobs then came down the stairs and surrounded him. 'They were all round me,' said Mr Gilroy. 'They were jumping on the seats and drop-kicking. They got me down in two minutes.'

He said: 'The bus driver said, ""I’m sorry you got a kicking, but we are not allowed to come out"".' The driver called the emergency services and Mr Gilroy was taken to hospital with severe bruising. He later rang First to complain about its security procedures, but he said the woman he spoke to even questioned him about what he had been doing on the top deck. He said: 'The safety of people travelling during the day on the bus is at stake. If this occurs again, if a gang of lads get on, the way she was talking, they can run riot. That can’t be right.

Millions of Britain's hard-pressed taxpayers will find themselves up to £705 better off after the coalition today delivered on its flagship tax cut a year early. Chancellor George Osborne announced that the amount of money that workers can earn before they start paying tax will be raised to £10,000 from April next year. That will take another 700,000 people out of tax altogether. Ministers had promised to deliver the key Liberal Democrat policy before the 2015 election, but the cut has been rushed forward by a year. Scroll down for video . Rising trend: This personal allowance graph taken from figures on the Institute for Fiscal Studies website shows how for a person aged under 65, it has risen from £3,005 to £8,105 from 1990/91 to 2012/13 . It is part of a bid to ease the burden on squeezed family budgets and provide an incentive to work. The personal allowance will already increase from £8,105 to £9,400 on April 1. The announcement means that from April 2014 the average taxpayer will pay £705 less income tax than before the 2010 general election. Ministers boast that the cash is the equivalent of the average gas bill or for two people to pay their council tax bill. The Lib Dems claim that the move will . mean 24million taxpayers will have been given an income tax cut since 2010. It . means a total of 2.7million people will pay no income tax at all. Is George Osborne's Budget good for Britain? Danny Alexander, the Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said: 'When times are as tough as they are now, our focus must be on helping those on low and middle incomes. 'The right to earn £10,000 income tax free has gone from the front page of our manifesto to the pockets of 27m hardworking people. By keeping this promise we are giving practical help to millions of families.' Critics have complained that the money . fails to compensate for other tax rises, including Mr Osborne’s early . decision to hike VAT from 17.5 per cent to 20 per cent. When the coalition was formed, the . Tories and Lib Dems pledged to ‘further increase the personal allowance . to £10,000, making real terms steps each year towards meeting this as a . longer term policy objective’. Going up: When the income tax threshold reaches £10,000 in April 2014, the average worker will be £700 better off than in 2010 . The Government promised to . ‘prioritise’ the policy over other tax cuts, including the Tory policy . to cut Inheritance Tax. The tax-free threshold in 2010 was £6,475, . rising to £7,475 a year later and then £8,105 last year. Mr Osborne had already announced that . the threshold is due to rise again to £9,400 in April this year, 12 . months earlier than expected. The allowance previously only rose in . line with inflation or rises in wages. Each £100 increase in the . personal allowance, above inflation, costs the Exchequer £500million. But free market think thank the Adam . Smith Institute urged Mr Osborne to lift the allowance to £12,875, which . would ensure full-time minimum wage workers would not have to pay any . tax. It said in a report last year that a . £12,875 personal allowance would increase the take-home pay of all those . earning less than £100,000 by £575 and lift up to 1,297,000 people out . of the tax system. The institute’s policy director Sam . Bowman said: ‘It is a national scandal that we tax the people at the . bottom of society so much that they can’t earn enough to achieve a basic . standard of living.’ Payments: From April 2014 the average taxpayer will pay £705 less tax than before the 2010 general election . Meanwhile hopes were also pinned on . the Chancellor easing the strain on savers today as well as building on . recent signs of confidence returning to the housing market. Savers have seen the returns on their . cash squashed by four years of ultra-low interest rates as living costs . remain high and wages are stagnant. Almost a dozen tax loopholes will be closed overnight as the government clamps down on those who scrimp on payments to the exchequer. As the Chancellor strives to plug Britain’s £32bn tax gap, he unveiled ‘the largest ever package to tackle tax evasion’. The host of measures is expected to bring in £4.6bn to Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs’ coffers over the next five years. Some ten loopholes will be shut down by the government, George Osborne announced. Tax specialists who concoct artificial avoidance schemes will be ‘named and shamed’ under proposals outlined in the budget. This is part of the attempts to ‘tackle both the supply and demand of these schemes,’ the document said. ‘A tax system where people and business pay the taxes expected of them is the glue that holds society together,’ the Chancellor declared. MPs previously lambasted US corporate giants Starbucks, Google and Amazon for scrimping on payments. Anyone, either a company or individual, who used a tax avoidance scheme in the past will also have to tell the taxman how much they saved by it – and pay it back. This could raise up to £130m over five years. One measure will see Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man enter into discussions with the Government over Britons with assets on the islands to settle up with the taxman over past dues. An estimated £8.5bn of funds are held on the islands by UK residents, and the government hopes to claw back £325m a year by 2016 from the measure. According to financial information . website Moneyfacts, the impact of inflation on savings means that . £10,000 invested five years ago, allowing for average interest and tax . at 20 per cent, would have the spending power of just £8,884 today. Former Government policy adviser Ros . Altmann, who recently stepped down as director-general of Saga, said . that the rules around tax-free Isas should be relaxed, so that people . can invest all of their allowance in cash Isas if they want to. Under the current system, only half of . the £11,280 allowance for this tax year can be saved in cash and the . remainder must be invested in stocks and shares. Dr Altmann said: ‘Older people who . need to live on their savings cannot afford to gamble on the stock . market, nor can younger generations who are saving for a house deposit. ‘It is important, especially given the . dramatic drop in savings interest rates, that the Government helps . savers and allows them the choice of whether to invest in cash or other . assets freely.’ Mr Osborne could also today signal . that corporation tax will be cut to 20 per cent. He has already slashed . the headline rate from 28 to 24 per cent and it is due to fall to 23 per . cent next month and 21 per cent in April 2014. But he is understood to be keen to . reduce corporation tax to 20 per cent – aligning it with the basic rate . of income tax and the tax rate on small companies. It comes as a new study showed the UK . has enjoyed a jobs ‘boom’ despite the economic downturn and huge . cutbacks in public spending, despite a fall in labour productivity and a . squeeze on pay. Leading analyst the Jobs Economist . said 2012 was the best year for employment growth since 2000, with . previous jobs booms taking place during periods of a strong economy. Director Dr John Philpott said: ’2012 . really was a year of extraordinarily strong employment growth. A jobs . boom without economic growth is unprecedented in recent UK economic . history.’ Budget day: Chancellor George Osborne has announced that the amount of money that workers can earn before they start paying tax will be raised to £10,000 from April next year .","Personal tax allowance will already rise from £8,105 to £9,400 on April 1 .

A civil servant has been fined almost £1,000 after years of botched DIY left his house in such a decrepit state it slashed the value of homes in the same street by £20,000. Gerald Watkins, 66, was hauled to court after neighbours complained his tumbledown property in South Wales was 'lowering the tone' of their area and planners called it dangerous. The once grand house in Newport is covered in scaffolding and several parts appear to be rotten and falling down, despite four years of work being done. Run down: Gerald Watkins, 66, has been fined almost £1,000 because of the poor state of his home in Newport, South Wales . A court heard Mr Watkin's messy makeover of his three-bedroomed semi was so 'unpleasant and unsightly' that it was spoiling the neighbourhood. The derelict-looking house stands out like a sore thumb in a street of smart houses valued at up to £250,000 - and neighbours claim it is devaluing their homes by £20,000. 'This is a nice street but his house looks like a complete dump. He started doing it up years ago - but is still miles away from finishing it,' one neighbour said. Mr Watkins was fined £400 with more than £500 costs after being taken to court by his local council for ignoring an enforcement notice to carry out repair work. He had been ordered to repair or demolish a garage, repaint window frames, clear vegetation in his garden and improve front door and roof slates. Repairs: The council has ordered works to be carried out across the house as it is a safety risk and an eye-sore . Problems: Neighbours claim the house has brought down the area and reduced the value of their properties by up to £20,000 . The order to maintain his property was made in September 2011. But when he did nothing about his house in the suburb of Allt-yr-yn, Newport, South Wales, council bosses lost patience with him and prosecuted him. Council solicitor Ian Cadenhead said: 'The property has not been maintained in the manner it should have been and has had a detrimental effect on the amenity of the area. 'It has a prominent location on the street and has impacted on its appearance. 'It is unpleasant and unmaintained and could pose a danger to the street if a fire breaks out there.' The court at Abergavenny was told that the council were not certain if Mr Watkins even lived at the property. Mr Cadenhead said: 'It's a shame it couldn't have been dealt with by paint being bought and a bit more work.' Down hill: The three-bedroom-semi has been worked on for four years but still looks like this, a court was told . Criticisms: The people living in this pretty Welsh street, with views of surrounding hills, claim the property is 'lowering the tone' Action: The council got involved in the case after neighbours in the South Wales street said they had enough . Mr Watkins did not appear in court and the case was found proved in his absence. He was fined £400 and ordered to pay £527 costs. The house was yesterday covered in scaffolding, the front door of the lean-top porch is flapping open, guttering is hanging loose and a downstairs windows is smashed. One neighbour said: 'We've been on at the council for years to do something about it. 'At times the gardens have looked like a jungle or a forest out of Lord of the Rings. 'There's been a fire inside the house and it has been broken into a couple of times. 'This is a lovely street spoiled by one house and it's probably lowered the values by at least £20,000. 'No-one knows much about Mr Watkins - he doesn't seem to live here but he visits occasionally. 'We only hope now he will pull his finger out and bring the house up to scratch.'","Gerald Watkins taken to court after complaints from locals in South Wales .

Heading for the baggage reclaim after a flight, most air travellers experience at a least a flicker of concern that their suitcases may not appear on the carousel. So imagine the exasperation of almost 200 passengers who arrived in Barbados from London to be told that their luggage had safely accompanied them across the Atlantic…but now had to go back again. Staff informed them that their cases were locked in the rear hold of the Virgin Atlantic Boeing 747 jumbo jet and the ground crew at Grantley Adams Airport couldn’t open the door to get them out. Jumbo blunder: A Virgin 747. There were 288 people on the eight-hour VS029 flight from Gatwick Airport, the majority were tourists beginning expensive Caribbean holidays . Eventually engineers in Bridgetown gave up and the bags were flown the 4,200 miles back to Gatwick for experts to work out how to open the hold door. It meant passengers who had set off from the rainy UK in winter clothes at 10.30am on Sunday were forced to wait until 6.15 last night to get their bags. As one frustrated passenger put it: ‘The luggage was in the hold but it was as if they forgot the key that opened it.’ By the time the bags were reunited  with their owners they had travelled almost 13,000 miles. Toby Radford, the newly appointed assistant head coach to the West Indies cricket team, was on the flight and had all his clothes and sports equipment in the hold. He said: ‘It had already been a bumpy flight so we were all glad to land but when we got into the baggage reclaim area it was crazy. Ground crew at Grantley Adams Airport in Barbados, pictured, couldn't open the door of the hold to get the bags out . Eventually engineers in Bridgetown gave up and the bags were flown the 4,200 miles back to Gatwick for experts to work out how to open the hold door . ‘It was left to local admin staff to explain the situation. There were some children on board. Some passengers were boarding cruise ships and worried about not receiving their luggage in time.’ Mr Radford, from Newbury in Berkshire, added: ‘I am walking around the Caribbean in my jeans and long sleeved shirt. I have nothing other than my laptop with me. I don’t have my toothbrush and I don’t have my contact lenses.’ Former Middlesex cricketer Mr Radford, 40, has coached England captain Andrew Strauss and is helping to prepare the West Indies for the visit of Australia later this month. He was able to start work with the squad yesterday after they found him some kit, though he was forced to wear the brogues he had flown in. There were 288 people on the eight-hour VS029 flight from Gatwick Airport, the majority were tourists beginning expensive Caribbean holidays. Passengers waiting for their luggage were walking about in the tropical heat in jeans and without their holiday belongings . The 88 passengers with their luggage in the front hold were able to reclaim their bags but the remaining 200 with bags in the rear hold were left waiting. After struggling to free the hold door manually the decision was taken for the bags to return to the UK for technicians to resolve the problem. Passengers at Grantley Adams International Airport waiting to return to the UK were allowed to board the plane and their luggage was placed in the front hold. Virgin Atlantic did not detail what the fault with doors was. A spokesman said: ‘We would like to apologise to all customers affected. ‘Every effort was made to open the luggage door manually in Barbados following a technical issue but the aircraft was returned to London. Support is being provided to people in Barbados.’","Bags flown 4,200 miles back to Gatwick for experts to open the door .

The world's youngest gastric sleeve patient claims having risky weightloss surgery at 12 years old transformed her life. Betsy Sanchez, from Coahuila in Mexico, is delighted to have slimmed down from 15 to ten stone since having 70 per cent of her stomach removed. Having now taken up exercise for the first time, 14-year-old Betsy is no longer a target for cruel bullies who teased her about her size. Radical change: Betsy Sanchez before the weightloss surgery, left, and after shedding five stone, right . Active lifestyle: Betsy, who was morbidly obese at 15st, is now 10st and enjoys horse-riding and spending time with friends . The change took place thanks to the her uncle, Dr Guillermo Alvarez, a bariatric surgeon who carries out the controversial permanent weightloss operations on adolescents. Betsy's mother Ana, the doctor's second cousin, says that taking the drastic step was the only way to stop her daughter following the . same heartbreaking path as Georgia Davis, the 19-year-old British girl whose food . addiction caused her to balloon to 63st. 'Diet and exercise didn't work for Betsy - she was addicted to food, only surgery would work,' said 39-year-old Mrs Sanchez. 'If Georgia had an operation at 12, she'd be happy and healthy now. She's lost years of her life. She might be too big now to safely have the operation - which proves it's sometimes better to have it young.' Food obsessed: Betsy, pictured with her mother Ana, struggled with her weight from the age of four . Controversial procedure: Betsy's surgery was carried out by her uncle Dr Guillermo Alvarez, left . Dr Alzarez says having surgery is . helpful for children who are struggling to lose weight because having a . much smaller stomach restricts their food intake. He . claims the surgery not only benefits a child's health - helping prevent . medical issues such as diabetes and liver disease - but improves their . confidence and allows for a more active childhood and happier school . life. Dr Alvarez, who . receives patients from across the USA, Britain and Europe, has since . operated on other children, but sets a lower age limit of 12. Betsy said: 'When my uncle said he could make me thinner I was so excited. I can still eat whatever I want but smaller portions. 'I can have McDonald's, but much smaller portions, only two chicken nuggets and chips. 'Out of control': Betsy at five and seven. The little girl weighed four stone by three years old and was 'always hungry', according to her family . 'I'm much happier. I now go horse-riding and I have lots of friends.' Betsy's weight problems began at the age of three when she started asking for extra portions and demanding snacks between meals, causing her weight to soar to four stone. A gastric sleeve is one of the newer types of weightloss operations. The stomach is permanently reduced to about 25 per cent of its original size, by surgical removal of a large portion of the stomach. The open edges are then attached together (often with surgical staples) to form a sleeve or tube with a banana shape. It may be appropriate for people who can't return as often for the follow-up visits required by gastric band procedures. A gastric band is a silicone band with an inflatable inner collar that is fitted around the upper stomach to restrict food intake, creating a small pouch and a narrow passage to the lower stomach. This passage delays the emptying of food from the pouch and causes a feeling of fullness. The band can be tightened or loosened over time. Mrs Sanchez admitted she and her furniture dealer husband Guillermo, 44, kept treats in the house for their two other children, aged 13 and nine. She said: 'Betsy would have four cookies and four crackers between meals. If I tried to stop her, she'd have a tantrum. She was always hungry. 'I tried serving healthy food and cutting portions, but Betsy was out of control.' Betsy's parents took her to see a paediatrician and she was tested for an underactive thyroid, but no medical reason was found for her weight issues. Nutritionists and psychologists also failed to find a solution. The 14-year-old said: 'When I asked mum for seconds she gave in. I used to comfort eat because I was bullied.' By the age of seven, Betsy was eating . up to 3,000 calories a day - double the recommended intake for her age - . and by the time she was nine she was a size 20 and weighed 13st. She . added: 'My parents took me to see lots of doctors and nutritionists but . nothing helped me lose weight. I was worried I was going to get so fat . I'd end up bedridden.' At . 12, Betsy weighed 15st and had a BMI of 41, making her morbidly obese. Her parents took her to see Dr Alvarez, Mrs Sanchez's second cousin, . anxious that Betsy might be suffering from depression and could develop . medical issues such as diabetes and high cholesterol. Dr . Alvarez explained all young patients undergo a psychological evaluation . to ensure they understand the implications of weightloss surgery. They . are put on a nutrition and exercise program which continues after the . operation. Demanding child: Betsy, pictured aged seven and eight, would have tantrums if she was not allowed second helpings and snacks . Happy teenager: Betsy admits she used to comfort eat because she felt miserable about her weight . Confident: Betsy has gone from 15st to 10st and enjoys activities such as horse-riding for the first time . He eventually operated on Betsy in 2008, after studies showed the benefit of surgery on young people. Betsy is believed to be the youngest patient ever to undergo the gastric sleeve. 'It is very controversial to operate on children,' said Dr Alvarez. 'But I see the benefits of helping children in cases where parents have tried everything but nothing else seems to control their eating problem. 'It has changed Betsy's life. She now goes to a new school where no-one even knows she used to be overweight.' Mrs Sanchez added: 'Betsy is like a different girl. She is still shy, but she is blossoming into a beautiful young woman, making friends, and enjoying her teenage years. 'I think surgery is definitely worth considering in some cases for children like her.'","Betsy Sanchez, 14, has slimmed down from 15st to 10st following operation .

Health minister Dr Daniel Poulter says the NHS is clamping down on excessive spending on agency doctors . The NHS is paying trainee doctors more than £2,000 for a day’s work, it has emerged. Hospitals are squandering tens of millions of pounds on agency workers to cover shifts at understaffed hospitals. Desperate trusts are being forced to hire temporary doctors to plug holes during busy times and fill in for shortages created by illness, maternity leave and reduced working hours for junior doctors. But, according to figures released under the Freedom of Information Act, at least one in six hospitals admitted spending more than £1,000 a day to hire individual medics since 2010. In one instance, a stand-in consultant was paid £15,000 for a week’s cover in Cumbria – which would equate to more than £700,000 in annual pay. Another hospital, in Essex, paid a trainee doctor £2,107 for a 12½-hour shift last year, even though the basic pay for the most experienced junior is only in the region of £30,000 a year. According to figures released under the Freedom of Information Act, more than £2billion has been spent by hospitals on locum doctors over a three-year period. The sum could have paid the full-time wages of 32,000 first year junior doctors or up to 10,000 consultants over the same period. The temporary staff are provided by agencies, which take a large percentage of the payments. The annual national spend on temporary medics has risen 8 per cent since 2011, the figures also reveal. Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: . ‘These pay deals demonstrate that there are huge savings to be made in . the protected NHS budget. Expenditure: One trust spent £15,000 on a doctor for one week. Picture posed by models . The NHS says it has reduced its reliance on agency staff over the past few years . ‘Patients want their hard-earned cash spent on providing treatment and . key drugs, not on excessive pay for doctors. It’s crucial that these . costs are cut drastically.’ Other examples of profligacy include East . Kent Hospitals University Foundation Trust paying £2,474 for a . non-consultant doctor to work a nine-and-a-half hour A&E shift – a . rate of more than £250 an hour. Northern Lincolnshire and Goole Hospitals Foundation Trust spent £2,594 on a consultant haematologist to work 24 hours. Health minister Dr Daniel Poulter said demand for agency staff had . increased since EU rules were brought in in 2009 to stop junior doctors . working more than 48 hours a week. He said: ‘The European Working Time Directive (EWTD) has created . problems for the National Health Service on a number of issues including . increased reliance on locum doctors, reduced continuity of patient . care, and poorer training for junior doctors. Whilst we cannot return to . the excessive hours worked by junior doctors in the past, we are . committed to limiting the application of the EWTD in the NHS. ‘We are continuing to seek changes in Europe, but in England we are also . reviewing doctors’ contracts because some of the issues can be improved . by changes to ensure that junior doctors can spend more time training . with senior consultants.’ Commenting on the figures, Dr Poulter added that  it was crucial for NHS trusts to reduce excess spending on temporary staff. He said: ‘Many hospitals have reduced their reliance on locum doctors, . but there are also a number of hospitals which must reduce both the use . and the cost of locums.’ Labour health spokesman Andrew Gwynne MP said: ‘Patients will find this . impossible to understand when hard-working nurses are being given pay . freezes and P45s to cut costs.’","Agency doctors have cost the public £2bn since 2010/11 .

It had stood through war, pestilence and more than 1,200 years of whatever the British weather could throw at it. But now a historic tree believed to be the oldest oak in the land has finally been brought crashing down. The Pontfadog Oak was felled by 55mph gales that hit North Wales on Wednesday night. Collapse: Pontfadog Oak tree which has stood since the year 802 after it fell in the early hours of Thursday morning . Debris: The tree fell as wind speed approached 60mph in areas near Chirk, north Wales . Conservationists had repeatedly called for the ancient tree, which had a 42ft girth, to be supported so it could be preserved by future generations. But the £5,700 cost was considered too high, so nothing was done to protect the sessile oak. It had grown at Chirk, near Wrexham, since at least 802AD – although some claim it may have been 1,600 years old. Welsh Prince Owain Gwynedd rallied his army beneath its branches in 1157, before defeating Henry II at the battle of Crogen. Happier times: The 1,200-year-old tree before it collapsed . Inspection: The Pontfadog Oak collapsed after it was recommended that work should be carried out to preserve it . Legend has it that the tree was spared when Henry had his men cut down the surrounding woods in 1165 and its huge hollow trunk was said to be large enough to seat six people. Woodland Trust conservation adviser Jill Butler said: ‘This venerable old tree has had a lot to cope with over the past few weeks, with heavy snow, a prolonged cold snap and finally high winds. ‘But the Woodland Trust believes that this sad case illustrates how we are failing to provide adequate protection for our ancient trees at present.’ Wreckage: Experts said the tree collapse was completely unexpected but comes after it has been battered by both snow and strong winds in recent weeks . Historic: It measured a staggering 12.9metres across and was big enough to sit six people inside its enormous hollow trunk . Damage: The owner of the tree, Diane Coakley-Williams, said that not enough had been done to help preserve it . The winds that hit most of the UK this week have now died down with mild and dry weather forecast for today and tomorrow. The South and South East of England should see some sunshine. Met Office forecaster Charlie Powell said: ‘We are looking at a pleasant weekend, with temperatures two or three degrees warmer than the seasonal average. ‘The best of the weather may not come till next Tuesday, when it could hit 18C (64F) in London.’ Spring blooms: Abby Keverne admires the Primroses at the Tregothnan Tea Gardens in Cornwall .

These dramatic photos show the changing face of a popular beach that has had an astonishing 6,000 truckloads of sands washed away in just three years. Worried owners of a holiday park overlooking Hopton-on-Sea beach in Norfolk said the damage threatens the future of the seafront, popular with celebrities including TV presenter Stephen Fry. They fear that without more protection the cliffs that their £60million caravan site stands on will crumble into the North Sea - and want an urgent £10million repair job to bring back the beach. Today: Relentless and unremitting, wave after wave destroys the remnants of the Hopton-on-Sea beach . June 1996: Pictured in its former glory, these miles of golden sands have been cruelly ripped away . Blamed: The erosion of Hopton Beach has been blamed on a new outer harbour at nearby Great Yarmouth (pictured) by a report . All at sea: Hopton Beach (centre) which has been eroded since the development of a new outer harbour at Great Yarmouth (circled top right) Bourne Leisure commissioned a two-year study which claims the erosion has been caused by the construction of nearby Great Yarmouth Outer Harbour in 2008 - something the port company denies. The report said building the harbour 600m into the sea has altered the tidal drift and taken the sands away from Hopton - and Bourne Leisure now wants a group of authorities to fund the restoration job. They include the port's management company EastPort UK, owned by investment giant Global Infrastructure Partners, whose advisory board chairman is former prime minister Sir John Major. Bourne Leisure said the marina was built under an Act of Parliament with provision for protecting the surrounding coast from erosion, meaning the current owners could be liable for rebuild costs. A Bourne Leisure spokesman said: ‘We are determined to work with the people of Hopton and the relevant bodies to ensure the replacement of the beach. April 2012: Pictured one year ago, the sand at Hopton-on-Sea beach has all but been replaced with shingle . Damaged: A section of the sea defences begin to buckle and give way as the tide comes in on Hopton beach . No protection: Sea defences can't stop the tide which has been rapidly eroding the beach and damaging the cliff face . Broken: The incessant pounding of the incoming tide has caused a concrete path leading down to the beach to collapse . ‘It is imperative that the port authority meet their commitments which they agreed to under an Act of Parliament, the Outer Harbour Revision Order 2005. Fan: The beach is said to be a favourite of celebrities such as TV presenter Stephen Fry . 'We hope this can be resolved amicably but the beach must be returned.’ The port was completed in 2008 but two years later the holiday park said there was ‘significant proof’ that the beach was being washed away. Coastal erosion expert Dr Philip Barber studied the damage and his report concluded that the port was to blame because of the changes it caused to the tidal flow and littoral drift. Since 2010 Hopton Beach has lost between 20,000 to 40,000 cubic metres of sand each year - equivalent to 6,000 truckloads. Bourne Leisure want the port owners to pay for specialist granite groynes to be built onto the sand and also want to hire a dredger from Holland which will spray sand from the seabed onto the beach. Dr Barber said: ‘The work has shown . that new Outer Harbour significantly changes the tidal flows in the . area. This and the impact of the waves has led to the beach . disappearing.’ But Eliza . O'Toole, vice chairman of Great Yarmouth Port Company - trading as . EastPort UK - said: ‘There is no evidence that the Outer Harbour is . responsible for or contributing to the erosion of Hopton Beach. October 2005: The Norfolk beach is pictured before tens of thousands of cubic metres of sand were lost . ‘We are advised by (water consultants) HR Wallingford that variability in beach level and the position of the offshore banks on this coastline is something that has been happening for many tens if not hundreds of years prior to the advent of the outer harbour. ‘There have been modern sea defences at Hopton since at least the late 1960s reflecting this. The outer harbour was not completed until 2010 and cannot be said to be responsible for long standing coastal processes affecting the beach. ‘The provision of coast defences are also the responsibility of various statutory authorities, not the Port.’ Giant leap: People can no longer access the beach from steps due to erosion . No go: Another concrete path has collapsed and wooden steps put in to make access to the beach easier are useless as a result . Golden sands: The beach pictured in 2000. Old pictures of the resort show the extent of the erosion .","Owners of holiday park at Hopton-on-Sea beach in Norfolk are fearful .

Mr Pankhurst, whose photo was published in Australia today by Sydney's Daily Telegraph as he walked with an Australian Federal Police Officer, told he paper he could make no comment on the investigation because it was still continuing. Spotlight: Lauren Martell emerging from her home today. Detectives spent nearly three hours taking a statement from the former accountant . Inquiry: Mrs Martell said later that the detectives had told her they were interviewing other people in Australia . Harris has already been interviewed twice in Britain but no charges have been laid and he has strenuously denied any wrongdoing. He was questioned as part of Operation Yewtree, sparked by the numerous claims of sexual abuse by Jimmy Seville. Neither is it known at this stage whether Mrs Martell once lived in he UK. Police began interviewing her at noon in Australia (3am London time today). Mrs Martell said later that the detectives had told her they were interviewing other people in Australia as part of their on-going investigations into the claims against Harris.

Still, the stenographer had to transcribe what he heard - or thought he had heard - and flashed the phrase up on the closed caption video screens. So those relying on the screens for . dialogue heard His Holiness finish his message of peace by telling them . them they could do the unspeakable. Embarrassingly, the His Holiness was . just being polite, telling the audience that if they did not agree with . his views on world peace, they could just ... forget. Blooper! The Dalai Lama's phrasing got lost in transcription as he delivered a world peace lecture on International Affairs on Wednesday at the Rhode Island Convention Center . The Dalai Lama, delivering the memorial lecture at Brown University on Wednesday, called on the audience to create a peaceful society through dialogue. 5,600 people were inside the Rhode Island Convention Centre in Providence, although it is not known how many of them thought they heard what the stenographer heard. The offending phrase came towards the send of the speech, when the 77-year-old said: 'If you feel these points are not much relevant - not much interest - then forget.' But the now presumably-blushing stenographer had to go with his first instinct, and the exact phrase he wrote on the screens in the hall was 'f--- it'. 'Apologies for any confusion': The Dalai Lama, sporting a Brown University cap, blesses the crowd during his speech. The university later clarified his remarks . This is not the first time the Dalai Lama has been heard not swearing. The NY Daily News recounts the occasion he told a crowd in Charlottesville, Vancouver, how we 'should forget about our religious differences' - causing similar confusion. This time, Brown University clarified the situation, telling the Daily News: 'The Dalai Lama's last word of the day, verified by his personal translator, was ""forget"". Another clip on YouTube also shows the esteemed holy man telling a crowd: 'We should forget about our religious differences. And also forget, and forget.'

Battle: Former French minister Patrick Devedjian is suing the writers of a book that claims he was having an affair with First Lady Valerie Trierweiler . A former French government minister is demanding £120,000 in damages over ‘salacious’ claims he had an extra-marital affair with First Lady Valerie Trierweiler. Patrick Devedjian denies being one of Ms Trierweiler’s two lovers she was while still married nine years ago. The allegations emerged in a biography of the First Lady called The Troublemaker, which says she was having affairs with both Devidjian and Francois Hollande while married to Denis Trierweiler in 2004. President Hollande’s 47-year-old girlfriend also denies the claims and she too is suing the book’s authors. Devidjian’s lawyer Dan Hazan said his married 68-year-old client - a minister under President Nicolas Sarkozy - was demanding damages for defaming his character. Mr Hazan added: 'The authors transformed a salacious rumour into fact purely to boost sales. 'There is not a scrap of evidence that this supposed relationship existed.' The book - by TV journalists Christophe Jakubyszyn and Alix Bouilhaguet - claims both Devidjian and Hollande knew they were ‘sharing’ Ms Trierweiler. But when Mr Devidjian refused her demands to leave his wife, she chose her affair with Mr Hollande over him, before finally divorcing her husband in 2010, the book says. Ms Trierweiler is demanding £35,000 in damages for invasion of privacy and will launch a separate action for defamation at a later hearing. When her case first came before a court in December, President Hollande was accused of abusing his position by personally writing to the judge to defend his live-in lover. French President Francois Hollande and his partner Valerie Trierweiler. The accusations over her fidelity were made in a biography of the First . Lady called The Troublemaker . In the hand-written letter, the president called the claims ‘pure fabrication’. Miss Trierweiler is facing a separate bizarre legal action in France over claims the taxpayer should not be supporting her lifestyle as the ‘president’s mistress’. Supermarket chain heir Xavier Kemlin launched the highly unusual criminal complaint in March, telling the French media: 'It's scandalous that our taxes are being used to house, feed, upkeep and pay for the staff and travel of a lady to whom we have no legal obligation.' Miss Trierweiler also recently sued a French magazine for publishing photos of her in her bikini while on holiday with Mr Hollande last summer - but was awarded only the ‘minimum’ £5,000 in damages.","Patrick Devedjian denies being a former lover of Ms Trierweiler .

Tesco bosses have been forced to scrap part of their latest television advert - because it was due to include images of a horse. The new ad had been planned weeks in advance of the horse meat scandal and was due to be unveiled later this month, complete with two separate shots of a cute-looking equine. Tesco have confirmed that the scenes have been hastily edited out, following the revelation that traces of horse DNA have been found in beef burgers sold by the supermarket giant. A spokesman for Tesco said: 'We have re-edited a new advert which had included a horse in the original version. It will be broadcast next week.' The exact details of what the horse was doing in the advert are being kept hush-hush but it is thought that the original plan was to use it in a humorous context. An industry source commented: 'Just when you think things couldn't get any worse, imagine the reaction it would of caused if Tesco had trotted out an advert with a horse after apologizing for unwittingly selling horsemeat in beef-burgers. 'There was understandably a lot of sensitivity about the issue at Tesco and so the offending scenes were very quickly binned.' The ad is understood to have been in the final stages of editing at a top London production house when the DNA scandal broke.","At 11pm yesterday, Tesco tweets: 'It's sleepy time so we're off to hit the hay!'

The parents accused of beating their four-year-old son to death and burying him in a shallow grave treated his third-degree burns with honey and sought medical advice from the chiropractor instead of taking him to the ER, it emerged in court yesterday. Nathan Sloop, 34, and his wife Stephanie, 30, from Farmington, Utah, have been charged with aggravated murder in the death of Ethan Stacey. Today is the final day of the preliminary hearing in the shocking and brutal murder of Stephanie's son, whose body was found in a shallow grave in the mountains on May 11, 2010. His face was beaten beyond recognition with a hammer, his body was burned and dog food was sprinkled over him. He had also been starved and bruised. Innocent: Officials said Ethan suffered about 10 days worth of severe abuse, including starvation, burning and beatings . Accused child murderer: Nathan Sloop arrives for the first day of his preliminary hearing on Wednesday, March 27, 2013, at Second District Court in Farmington, Utah . A judge will have to decide if there is enough evidence to send them to trial for the murder. Defense attorneys presented their . case yesterday and said that though the parents did not seek the right . medical treatment, they did try to get help for the boy. The evidence showed the Sloops had . asked their chiropractor how to treat Ethan’s second-and third-degree . burns, along with how to handle Ethan’s behavioral issues, according to . the Salt Lake Tribune. The chiropractor, who never examined . Ethan, told them to put honey on the wounds and give the boy oregano oil . to control the behavioral issues. Defense attorney Richard Mauro said: . 'They thought that Ethan was sick. They believed that he was ill and . they thought he had an allergy. They were giving him over-the-counter . medications and they ended up harming him more than they were helping . him.' The court also heard yesterday about . the amount of prescription medication that Nathan Sloop was taking in . the months before Ethan died. According to a Department of Professional Licensing document, which . tracked all of the narcotics that Nathan Sloop was prescribed, he was . given 4,146 pills in an 11-month period including Lortab, Valium, Percocet, an antihistamine and anxiety medication. On Wednesday, court heard disturbing video recordings, phone calls and horrific messages about how the Sloops would allegedly treat Ethan and how they would have to 'break his ego'. Crime and punishment: Nathaniel Sloop, left, could face the death penalty for allegedly beating his stepson, four-year-old Ethan Stacy, right, to death in 2010 while the boy was staying with his biological mother . Judge Glen Dawson presides over the evidentiary hearing for Nathanael Sloop as he speaks with lawyers for the prosecution and defense at an evidentiary hearing prior to Sloop's preliminary hearing . 'I told you we had a pit bull on our hands, but they learn,' Sloop messaged Stephanie on May 3, 2010. 'Just like Mommy LOL,' she replied. 'I told you we had to break his ego,' Sloop texted. Then on May 5 she wrote: 'He is broke that's for sure.' Sloop replied they 'had to figure out how to keep him in his room'. Both face capital murder and other charges in the boy's death. Prosecutors plan to seek the death penalty against Sloop. In addition to capital murder, the . defendant also faces charges of obstructing justice and intentionally . inflicting serious injury on a child, and desecration of a dead body, Desert News reported. In court yesterday, prosecutor David . Cole said it was Sloops' 'reckless indifference to human life' that . caused the boy's death. He said Ethan was scalded, beaten, over-medicated and not given the medical care that he needed. The defense argues the boy was given too much Benadryl, Tylenol and decongestant and died from dehydration. The court heard tapes wherein Sloop told police he would slap the child, make him stand with his nose against the wall and once pushed him into scalding water. He also described a time when both he and Stephanie put feces into his mouth and said they never took him to hospital when he was sick. '(Ethan) had seen things and heard things that a four-year-old boy should never see or hear,' he said. Courtroom procedure: Judge Glen Dawson, left, set the pretrial hearing for Sloop, right, for March 27-29 . Two homes: Ethan Stacy pictured with his biological father Joe Stacy . The court also heard a jail-house . phone call to his mother when Sloop called Ethan 'poison' that sunk his . relationship with Stephanie Sloop 'like a battleship'. He . also said the boy was disobedient and misbehaved, often sneaking from . his room and turning on video games or going to the refrigerator. Layton . Police Sgt Jeff Roderick reported that there were traces of blood found . on the wall of Ethan's room, believed to be from the boy's nose rubbing . against the wall. In a . short video shown to the court, Ethan can be seen looking dishevelled . with some redness on his cheek. He says to the camera: 'I'm having fun . with Nathan. He's not scary anymore.' In . an audio recording also played in court, Nathan Sloop can be heard . asking Ethan numerous times whether he wanted to stay in Utah or return . to live with his father in Virginia. He repeatedly asked the boy if his . father was mean or hurt him. 'Where do you want to live?' Sloop asked. Through tears and wheezing, Ethan croaks back: 'My mom, my mom, my mom.' Sloop . pleaded not guilty to the charges last year. Asked if they would . consider a plea deal, Sloop's attorney, Richard Mauro, said that they . are just preparing for the preliminary hearings and waiting to see what . the prosecution presents as evidence. Mauro said he plans to challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty as part of a series of motions he'll file. Sloop's . wife, Stephanie Sloop, 30, faces identical charges for contributing to . her son's death or failing to stop it, but it remains unknown whether or . not the prosecutors will seek the death penalty for her. She is due . back in court April12. Two of a kind: Nathan Sloop, left, and his wife and Ethan's biological mother, Stephanie Sloop, right, reported the boy missing a day before his disfigured and burned body was discovered in a shallow grave near a ski resort . Heart-breaking: The Sloops allegedly left the little boy beaten and locked up at home while they went to get married in May 2010 . Investigators say that on the day of Nathan and Stephanie Sloop's wedding May 6, the child was locked in an apartment bedroom on his own because the couple feared people would call police if they saw the toddler's injuries. Following her arrest, Stephanie Sloop told police that on May 7, 2010, she got a call from her husband saying that her son had burned himself while taking a bath, according to CBS News. When the mother reached home, probable cause documents state she found Ethan with severe burns to his feet and along the back of his legs. She also noticed what she described as human feces in the four-year-old's mouth. Mrs Sloop told police that she did not seek medical help for her injured son because she was afraid that Nathan Sloop would harm her if she tried to do so. On Mother's Day, May 10, 2010, Stephanie and Nathan Sloop reported the boy missing after discovering that Ethan had died, according to prosecutors. The Sloops told police that the toddler wandered out of the apartment in Layton. However, the following evening, the child's remains were discovered wrapped in plastic and dumped in a shallow grave near Powder Mountain in Weber County. The four-year-old's face was severely disfigured, and there was dog food sprinkled on his grave.","Ethan Stacy's body was found with dog food sprinkled over it in the mountains in May 2010 .

Michele Bachmann’s former chief of staff said his client will admit that the Minnesota congresswoman’s 2012 presidential campaign paid an Iowa state senator to work for her, in violation of House ethics rules and federal election law. Andy Parrish will show an Iowa legislative ethics panel proof, according to his lawyer, that Bachmann fundraiser Guy Short used his private Iowa consulting firm to funnel $7,500 per month to state Sen. Kent Sorenson for working on the failed Bachmann presidential campaign. Parrish was previously referred to as 'Witness A' in committee documents, acknowledged his lawyer John Hugh Gilmore, according to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune. Minnesota Republican Rep. Michele Bachmann traveled to London for Baroness Margaret Thatcher's funeral, providing her and her staff with a welcome break from questions about the ethical clouds hanging over her office and her failed 2012 presidential campaign . Bachmann pressed the flesh in 2011 with Iowa campaign manager Kent Sorenson, a state senator who later jumped ship to work for Texas Rep. Ron Paul . Sorenson has called the ethics charges against him 'totally baseless, without evidence, and a waste of Iowans’ time and money.' Bachmann's attorneys have also denied that she did anything wrong. But there's no love lost between Sorenson and Bachmann: Despite the alleged payments that he added to his state legislative salary, he left the Bachmann campaign in December 2011 to work for rival Rep. Ron Paul. Election law and legislative ethics rules forbid state representatives in Iowa from accepting money to campaign for other candidates. Parrish, said Gilmore, will swear out an affidavit and provide supporting documents. The case against Sorenson and . Bachmann was launched after another former aide, a Florida pastor named . Peter Waldron, came forward with the same allegations. He . told the Star-Tribune that Parrish's decision to say what he knows . suggests an 'impeccable character and a sense of civic duty that is . extraordinary.' This April 9 press event turned into a melee when reporters asked tough questions about alleged Bachmann payments to an Iowa state legislator for campaign work, and staffers quickly rushed her out of the room . Michele Bachmann's book 'Core of Conviction' sold poorly despite a full-court press to market it as a campaign tool before the Iowa Caucuses. Bachmann . has come under a separate cloud of suspicion over unrelated charges that . she used campaign staffers to promote and sell her book, Core Of . Conviction, while on the presidential campaign trail in 2012. The independent Office of Congressional Ethics is investigating the . claim, according to two former campaign staffers who spoke to the Star-Tribune on condition of anonymity. A Bachmann campaign lawyer says the book's publisher paid to promote the book and covered the expenses of a book tour. It's unclear, however, who paid top campaign staffers to accompany Bachmann to book-signing events and gather the small crowds that met her. Emails seen by the Star-Tribune . indicate that Bachmann's Iowa campaign manager and fundraiser were . intimately involved in the book's promotion. The book did not sell well, with some estimates putting its total performance at fewer than 3,000 copies. Blogger and attorney John Hugh Gilmore (L) was booked into the Hennepin County Jail for disorderly conduct and failing to cooperate with arresting officers. He represents Andy Parrish (R), a former Bachmann chief of staff who ahs accused her of campaign finance wrongdoing . Meanwhile, . state Rep. Sorenson faces his own separate political headache, with a . former staffer accusing him of raiding her personal computer to steal a . private list of Iowa home-schooling families, presumably for fundraising . purposes. A criminal investigation in that case is ongoing. And Parrish's attorney, a well-known right-wing activist who writes the Minnesota Conservatives blog, has faced credibility problems since he was arrested in 2011 for disorderly conduct in an altercation with two hijab-wearing Muslim women in Minneapolis. Police in that case reported that he was drunk, according to the Twin Cities-based Citypages. A YouTube video shows him attempting to contact conservative firebrand Andrew Breitbart, who was in town for a conservative online convention. Breitbart died in 2012. On April 9 a Bachmann press conference about Medicaid payments to doctors turned into a shoving match with reporters when the congresswoman's aides hustled her out of sight after the journalists raised questions about the Federal Election Commission and Office of Congressional Ethics investigations hanging over her head. Bachmann's press secretary did not respond to an email seeking comment.","Money was allegedly funneled through a  Bachmann fundraiser' company .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 20:08 EST, 4 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:14 EST, 4 March 2013 . First class rail travel has hit a record high in Britain but it's thanks to boozy revellers and youngsters rather than stuffy city gents and business executives, new figures show. More than 11 million tickets on the upmarket train compartments were sold last year, believed to be higher than even the golden age of rail travel back in the 1950s. Yet the modern first class passenger is more likely to be a student, football fan or on a stag or hen party than the upper class image from films like Brief Encounter. Living the high life: Despite the recession, first class travel is proving popular, as in this restaurant car on the train from London's Liverpool Street station to Norwich . The latest figures are from the Association of Train Operating Companies rounding up all the regional railway operator's into a nationwide total. Before the recession the most common kind of upmarket traveller was a high powered commuter or public sector worker who could get the bumper fares paid for on expenses. But now it is often more likely to be a gang of revellers off on a hen weekend who have picked up a first class ticket for just £5 a journey more than they would have paid for standard fare. Other typical commuters taking up the best seats on the train include students going home for a weekend having used their railcards to book the cheapest fares well in advance. Football fans are now more prepared to travel in a bit of style for away games as opposed to the old 'football specials' where they were herded like cattle into packed carriages. There are also other, more bizarre groups of first class travellers. According to Virgin there is a booming market in youngsters travelling from London to Manchester on Saturday evenings just to go to trendy nightclubs. And First Great Western are doing a roaring trade in nostalgic middle aged railway fans travelling first class just to recreate their own golden age of travel on Pullman Carriages with a full silver service meal option. Fan of first class: Chancellor George Osborne was famously caught out by ticket collectors after he refused to move to standard class last year, despite not having a first class ticket . It marks a massive turnaround in the kind of passenger now filling the plusher seats in first class, where they get free food and drink and more attentive waiter service. A few years ago the prices for first class fares on some city to city routes were so high it was often cheaper to fly instead. Since then employers have cut back on paying for expensive travel for their workers - even MPs have been forced by their expenses scandal to travel on standard class carriages. A first class seat from London to Manchester, booked in advance, can now be bought for as little as £36 one way, for instance. 2003 - 6,738,921 . 2004 - 6,922,701 . 2005 - 7,222,645 . 2006  - 8,148,420 . 2007 - 8,851,311 . 2008 - 9,787,707 . 2009 - 9,325,282 . 2010 - 9,722,875 . 2011 - 10,318,926 . 2012 - 11,040,364 . This led to rail companies bringing down the costs and bringing in special offers, particularly at weekends and evening, for instance offering upgrades to first class for just £5 or less. And it has sparked a boom in travelling in style but from a whole new market, said ATOC, which has been compiling first class ticket sales since 2003. Back then just 6.7 million were bought, rising to 9.8 million in 2008, dropping the next year but then recovering to the new record high. However, the 11 million figure is likely to be the highest ever as recently published statistics show the number of UK train journeys of 1.4 billion in 2012 was actually a 90-year-high. Michael Roberts, Chief Executive at ATOC, said: ""Train companies have responded to the tough economic climate by offering a range of deals and investing in improved services to encourage more passengers to travel first class. ""It is exactly this kind of commercial approach by operators that helps to explain why travelling by train has become more popular over a double dip recession, generating revenue to pay for services and sustaining government investment.""","First class travellers are likely to be students or stag and hen parties .

Police said in a probable cause . statement that the suspect threw the victim's severed arms at passersby . shortly before he was taken into custody. Potter appeared via video from the Adair County Jail with his attorney, Kevin Locke, on Tuesday.

On the evening of January 6, police . were called to Village 76 apartments at 170 Valley Forge Drive in . Kirksville on a report of a car on fire in the parking lot. When cops arrived, they found the vehicle consumed by flames, as well as two nearby apartments that were also on fire.

Potter surrendered to officers and was arrested on charges of second-degree murder, arson and tampering with a motor vehicle. Murder investigation: Kirksville is located about 120 miles from Jefferson City . The murder charge against Potter was later upgraded to first degree after he was questioned by police. In an interview with invesitgatros, Potter allegedly waived his Miranda Rights and stated that he was angry when he entered Meredith's apartment armed with several knives and stabbed the man in the head and face, the newspaper reported. The motive behind Potter's rage remains unknown, but witnesses at the scene said he believed that Meredith had somehow harmed his son. An autopsy later showed that 'sharp force wounds to the left lung and heart' contributed to Meredith's death. It has not been revealed how old Meredith was, but officials said that he was born in Iowa and went by the name Jake Steadman.","Paul R.

Sally Roberts leaves the High Court after the judge ruled her son should have radiotherapy . A seven-year-old cancer sufferer can have radiotherapy against his mother's wishes, a High Court judge ruled today. Mr Justice Bodey said he was worried . Sally Roberts judgement had 'gone awry' after doctors said her son Neon . could die within months if he did not get it. Mrs Roberts, 37, a New Zealander who . lives in Brighton, East Sussex, fears that undergoing the treatment . would cause long-term damage to her son - such as a lowered IQ and . fertility damage. However, today the judge, who heard . evidence at a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in . London, ruled against her, adding: 'One cannot enjoy a quality of life . if one isn't alive.' Specialists treating Neon accepted . that there were side-effects to radiotherapy but said that without the . treatment the youngster could be dead within three months. Neon was diagnosed with a cancerous brain tumour and underwent an operation to remove it on October 25th this year. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are . routine follow-up treatments which doctors said would give Neon up to an . 86 per cent chance of survival. The ideal time to start this is within . 28 days of surgery taking place, but the delay means his chances of . surviving are now down to 67 per cent. The court heard his mother missed three vital hospital appointments. She then sparked a manhunt after going into hiding with him for four days without telling his dad Ben. The pair were found safe and well and Neon, who has a twin sister, was put into the care of his father. The hearing was told she would not let . doctors give him anti-sickness drugs after a brain operation this week . to remove a tumour. When given the chance to put forward . alternative treatments for her son at the High Court, Mrs Roberts’s . suggestions were labelled ‘completely unethical’. She then asked for more time to look into alternative therapies after researching on the internet but this was refused. Doctors called to give evidence told . the court: 'This boy has a very highly malignant disease and he will die . very quickly unless somebody gets their hands on him to treat him.' Case: Neon Roberts is at the centre of a legal dispute over his own cancer treatment . Experts said the UK was one of the . leading countries on the disease and that if parents looked elsewhere . they would be 'doing their child a disservice.' After hearing the case over four days . Mr Justice Bodey said: 'Before radiotherapy was developed patients . variably and also invariably died.' He said he found it hard to believe 'caring clinicians' would keep back alternative therapies which would work on children. Delivering his judgment, he said: 'The mother has been through a very stressful time. 'This sort of news is every parent's . worst nightmare, and I have sympathy for her, but I'm worried that her . judgment was gone awry on the question of the seriousness of the threat . which Neon faces. 'There was a time when she agreed with . the therapy. I express the hope that when the mother has reflected on . the outcome she will come to terms with it. 'I am sure she will support Neon through the very difficult times he has ahead. He needs both his parents to support him.' The judge said the case 'tilted well in the favour' of Neon's father and the hospital trust. Mrs Roberts, who admitted she . 'panicked' when she ran off with Neon, is now banned from applying for a . passport until December 2013. The hospital trust, which has not been . identified, asked for their costs to be paid by Mrs Roberts on the . grounds she put matters back when took Neon without his father's . knowledge. Mrs Roberts said she 'was not a bonkers mother' But Ian Peddie QC, representing her, told the court his client had no money. Neon will now live with his dad for the next year while he undergoes treatment before living permanently with his mother again. Mrs Roberts, who stared intently at the judge as the decision was read out, was told she could not appeal the case in the High Court. Ms Roberts had told the court she was not a 'bonkers mother'. She said she feared that radiotherapy would reduce Neon's intelligence quotient (IQ), shorten his life, put him at risk of having strokes and make him infertile. And she told the judge that she wanted medics to consider alternatives. Neon's father Ben said he was 'relieved' following the decision to give it the go ahead today. Ben Roberts was with his son Neon in hospital so was not at the hearing at the to hear the judgement handed down. In a statement issued following today's ruling his solicitor Gwen Williams said: 'Mr Roberts is relieved that the judge has been able to make a final ruling on Neon's treatment. 'Neon's health and recovery has always been Mr Roberts' priority. While he respected Neon's mother's views, his own opinion, following in depth discussions with doctors, has always been that Neon should have the treatment. 'He now hopes Neon can be allowed to recover from his latest operation and start the radiotherapy and chemotherapy that the doctors have outlined without further delay.' She said Mr Roberts was grateful for the careful way Mr Justice Bodey had made his decision and for the sympathy he had shown to his family. He also thanked medical teams treating Neon and 'for the great time and energy that have devoted to issues in the case.' Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Mr Justice Bodey said he was worried .

The world's first zoo-born male orangutan to be released into the wild has been killed by a poisonous snake after just 17 months in the jungle. Seven-year-old Semeru made history in 2011 when Perth Zoo in Western Australia decided he had the right temperament to be released into his natural rain forest habitat in Indonesia. But park rangers on the island of Sumatra were horrified to find his body in the jungle, where he had easily adapted to his surroundings. Poisoned: The seven-year-old orangutan became the first zoo-born male to be released into the wild in 2011 . However an investigation has now begun into whether his background of being born and raised for six years in a zoo left him without the basic instincts needed to protect himself from the dangers of the jungle. 'We have been keeping track of Semeru ever since he was released into a protected part of the rainforest and he seemed to be doing well,' said a spokesman for Indonesia's orang-utan rehabilitation department. 'We found a snake bite and tests have since proved he died from toxic poisoning.' His death might also have been due to what zoo officials said was his independent and curious nature. Instincts: Officials are looking into whether Semeru's upbringing at Perth Zoo left him without the basic instincts to cope in the jungle . Whether his curiosity had led to him approaching and perhaps trying to handle a toxic snake is a question that no-one will be able to answer. A spokeswoman for Perth Zoo said: 'All the staff are devastated at this loss, but we're glad that Semeru was able to spend part of his life in the wild.' Semeru was transported from Perth Zoo in October 2011 to Bukit Tigapuluh in Sumatra as part of the Sumatran orang-utan re-introduction programme to establish a new population of the crtically-endangered species in the wild. He was born at Perth Zoo in June 2005 to mother Sekara and father Dinara. Zoo officials said Sekara was an excellent first-time mother and doted on Semeru, the first of the third generation of orang-utans born at the zoo. He was chosen for the release programme because of his age and temperament. Officials said he had reached the natural age of dispersal for a male orang-utan and was confident, curious and independent. The world's first female orang-utan to be released into the wild was Temara, who was also born at Perth Zoo. She was released in the same area as Semeru in 2006 and is said to have adapted well to her surroundings. Indonesia has four extremely dangerous snakes, the venom of which can bring about death in an hour or so. Venomous: The black cobra (pictured) is one of a number of highly dangerous snakes found in Indonesia, along with the pit viper, the king cobra and the banded krait . They include: the banded krait, the bite of which causes muscle weakness, loss of co-ordination and eventually respiratory paralysis. Victims have only a 50 per cent chance of surviving. The black spitting cobra and the king cobra, the bite of both causing pain, muscle weakness and respiratory paralysis. The pit viper, which causes great pain, bleeding and tissue damage, and the tree snake, which also causes death through paralysis of heart and lungs.","Semeru, seven, was born in Perth Zoo and released into rainforest in 2011 .

Protected: David Cameron's Queen's speech on Wednesday will include a 'Bill of Rights for consumers' Shoppers will get money back from rogue websites, replacements for faulty items and poor quality home repairs redone, under new laws to protect the consumer. Ministers say too many people are unaware of their rights when buying goods and services online from downloading music and films to switching energy suppliers. A crackdown on rogue suppliers who provide substandard or damaged goods, or impose unfair terms and conditions will be announced in next week’s Queen’s Speech. Government sources say the measure . will help businesses who play by the rules, and is part of a Queen’s . Speech agenda of ‘helping those who do the right thing.’ The Tories are determined to win back . voters’ trust following a storming performance by the UK Independence . Party in last week’s county council elections in which they won 147 . sears. David Cameron will attempt to to . settle his party’s nerves in the Queen’s speech on Wednesday with a . focus on the economy and immigration. He has ditched nanny-state measures . such as minimum alcohol pricing, plain cigarette packets and a so-called . ‘snooper’s charter’ to monitor people’s internet usage, while the . pledge to enshrine foreign aid spending in law has been kicked into the . long grass. Instead the government will offer a . ‘pro-business, pro-growth agenda’ with bills to cut red tape, reduce the . National Insurance burden on small firms and boost investment in . infrastructure. It will also include populist measures . to restrict access to the NHS for new migrants, and make it easier to . deport foreign criminals, seen as grievances fuelling the UKIP vote. The measures to protect consumers will . condense 60 pieces of legislation into one beefed-up law covering . goods, services, digital content and unfair contract terms. Dubbed a ‘Bill of Rights’ for . consumers, business minister Jo Swinson said the law in this area has . become ‘too confusing with many people not sure where to turn if they . have a problem’. The Government say Britain’s shopping . habits have been transformed by new technology over the past decade, but . the law has not kept pace, leaving people at the mercy of rogue firms. Promises: David Cameron's new consumer law will condense 60 pieces of legislation into one beefed-up law covering goods, services, digital content and unfair contract terms . For digital content, such as films, music and games downloaded over the internet, providers must provide give a replacement or money back if the service does not work. When faulty goods such as laptops or microwaves break down, retailers will have to provide a refund after one failed repair or replacement within a stated time limit, and suppliers can no longer hide behind ‘unfair’ terms and conditions. Even verbal agreements made with builders are covered so if works are not carried out to the agreed standard they will have to be re-done or the customer given money off. Miss Swinson said: ‘Stronger consumer protection and clearer consumer rights will help create a fairer and stronger marketplace. We are hoping to bring in a number of changes to improve consumer confidence and make sure the law is fit for the 21st century.’ Help: Business minister Jo Swinson said the law protecting online shoppers is 'too confusing' The Department for Business say the . reforms law will save the economy around £4 billion over 10 years as . complaints will be resolved faster if people are aware if their rights, . Citizens Advice said that consumer complaints in the past year about goods and holidays totalled £185 million. Sixteen million people experienced a problem with digital content such as film or music downloads or software in 2011. Under the new law, trading Standards . will get more enforcement powers to take firms to court for compensation . if consumers’ rights are breached. Richard Lloyd, Which? executive . director, welcomed the move saying it would ‘make it easier for people . to understand their rights and give consumers power to challenge bad . practice.’ He said: ‘It . should also mean that both consumers and regulators have the tools they . need to challenge unscrupulous businesses that breach the law’. This . includes collective redress, when groups of consumers band together to . make a joint claim against a firm to boost their chances of success and . avoid crippling legal fees. It . is used against ‘anti-competitive’ behaviour such as airlines fixing . their fuel surcharge too high, petrol pumps wrongly calibrated so they . overcharge, or small businesses held to ransom by price-fixing . suppliers. Mr Lloyd said the . Government should go even further even these lines to allow third . parties like Which? to take against rogue companies ‘and force them to . put things right for consumers.’ Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice said the ‘staggering’ numbers of complaints they receive shows the need for a change in the law, but questioned whether it would be enough - and said rogue firms should be named and shamed. She said: ‘Consumers are often refused their legal rights when something they buy is faulty or sub-standard. ‘When businesses are taken to task for failing consumers the punishment should include compensating consumers and any retailer or provider who doesn’t abide by the rules should be named and shamed by regulators. ‘I’d like to see a ‘Santa List’ which identifies naughty and nice businesses. Publicly listing those businesses who do not comply with regulations will not only warn consumers but reward retailers who do the right thing by their customers.’","David Cameron to introduce 'Bill of Rights for consumers'

A man 'plagued the lives' of his neighbours' by playing BBC Radio 4 at maximum volume in the early hours of the morning, a court heard. Robert Thomas, 59, subjected the family next door to World Service news reports, documentaries and other music stations throughout the night. Stewart and Juliet Dunlop and their two teenage children were forced to wear earplugs to try and get some sleep. But when they complained Thomas began a 'sustained campaign of anti-social behaviour' - including vandalism and spraying them with a garden hose. The situation got so bad the family were eventually forced to move out of their semi-detached home next door to the defendant in the Hanham area of Bristol. Thomas had already been given an ASBO for his behaviour which he admitted breaching on four occasions between September and October 2011. He was handed a six month community order with six months supervision at Bristol Crown Court. Recorder Oba Nsugbe QC told him: 'There is no doubt you played music at times which were inappropriate and in a manner bound to cause disruption and upset. 'An ASBO is serious and you breached it which is obviously a serious matter.' The court was told Thomas became increasingly aggressive towards the family and at one point threw a garden ornament through their car window. On another occasion Thomas sat on the bonnet of Mrs Dunlop's car and stopped her from exiting her driveway. Thomas had already been sentenced to an interim ASBO meaning he must not cause anyone, including the Dunlops, harassment, alarm or distress. But while the interim ASBO was in place Thomas breached it on four occasions by playing loud music in anti social hours. Mr Reid continued: 'On September 14 the Dunlops were awoken by loud music at 5.15am. Through experience they were able to ignore it and put earplugs in. 'The same happened on September 16 and 17 when Mr and Mrs Dunlop were again awoken by loud music coming from the defendant's house. Anti-social behaviour: Thomas, 59, who lives in the house on the left, played Radio 4 so loud it kept his neighbours awake. They eventually moved out of their home . 'It was not just continuously loud music - it was being turned on and off - which is particularly irritating. It was loud, intrusive and completely inappropriate. 'On October 7 music was again heard and it was monitored by Environmental Health equipment. It was not just music but radio played loud and knocking against the wall.' The court heard Thomas had previous matters for anti-social behaviour including a caution for his behaviour towards the Dunlops. Oliver Wilmott, defending, said his client had a delusional disorder. An appeal against the imposition of the ASBO will be heard at a later date.","Robert Thomas, 59, played the World Service at deafening volume .

In apparent recognition of its unpopularity with many traditional Tory voters ¿ there was no mention of it in yesterday¿s speech setting out the Government¿s legislative programme . The Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill was rejected by more than half of his MPs in a Commons vote in February and was blamed by some for an exodus of traditional Tory supporters to the UK Independence Party in last week’s council elections. Labour MP Stephen Pound said the legislation was becoming ‘the Bill that dare not speak its name’. He added: ‘The speech has UKIP’s footprints all over it.’ Downing Street said there was no need for legislation to be in the speech because it was  a ‘carry-over’ measure introduced midway through the last session.

The Justice Secretary pledged yesterday to ‘turn the tide’ of criminality as a raft of new measures were announced aimed at encouraging prolific offenders away from crime. Tens of thousands of short-sentence prisoners will be put on compulsory supervision for at least 12 months after their release in a ‘targeted rehabilitation’ programme, said Chris Grayling. Compulsory drug testing for thousands of burglars, robbers and drug offenders will be extended so they can be hauled back to jail if caught using cannabis. Current tests cover only Class A drugs. David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband stand in the House of Lords to listen the Queen's speech, which included a raft of measurements designed to rehabilitate prolific criminals . The measures, revealed in the Queen’s Speech, are included in a new draft law, the Offender Rehabilitation Bill, which will be published in full today. Inmates will serve the final months of their jail term near home in ‘resettlement jails’ designed to prepare them for release. The measurements aim to make a dent in the 'appetite of offenders' Once out, they will be prevented from moving around the country and will have to work at rebuilding their lives. The former convicts will have to seek permission to move out of their local area to ensure they stick to community orders, instead of merely notifying probation as at present. Paedophiles, rapists and convicted terrorists will be placed on GPS tags so their movements can be monitored at all times. And vast swathes of the Probation Service will be contracted out to private companies and charities paid ‘by results’ if they turn criminals into honest citizens. Opponents said this could lead to the public being put at risk if private firms put profit ahead of safety. Mr . Grayling said he wanted to ‘put a stopper in the revolving door of the . justice system’ which sees as many as six in ten short-sentence . offenders return to crime within a year of their release. ‘Tackling our stubbornly high reoffending rates has dogged successive governments for decades,’ he said. ‘These reforms represent a golden opportunity to finally turn the tide. ‘It is simply not good enough that we . spend £4billion a year on prisons and probation and yet make no real . dent in the appetite of offenders to commit more crime. Chris Grayling wants to 'put a stopper in the revolving door of the justice system' ‘It is little wonder when many of our most prolific criminals leave prison totally unsupervised in the community. ‘These reforms are essential and will ensure that offenders are properly punished but also given targeted support to help them turn away from crime for good.’ Mr Grayling hopes to save millions by using private firms and charities to run rehabilitation projects outside the State sector. He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme this morning that the focus would be on finding efficiencies and there would be no extra money for the extra work. 'We have a system at the moment where only around 25 per cent of probation officers' time is spent working with offenders. Something like 40 per cent of the resources is spent support costs,' he said. 'We have reoffending rates that are rising among offenders jailed for less than a year. At the moment they walk out onto the streets with £46 in their pockets and that's it. That cannot be a sensible system and it needs to change.' He continued: 'We are talking about 250,000 people a year being supported through probation at the moment. This (reform) will bring another 50,000 people into the net for the first time. I am going to pay for that with a system that is less bureaucratic and more efficiently run.' But criminal justice analyst and former probation officer Harry Fletcher said: ‘There is no evidence that probation is failing. The experience of privatisation so far has been extremely disappointing. ‘All the evidence shows that probation has met all its targets and there is a real risk that public protection will be compromised if this controversial scheme goes ahead.’ Currently, prisoners serving 12 months or less are not given probation support when behind bars, and can spend as little as a few days in touch with their probation officer on release. This group of offenders committed more than 80,000 crimes in the year after their release. From 2015, all inmates will be given support services while in jail irrespective of the length of their sentence. And all will spend at least a year being monitored in the community after release. During this period, they will be required to undergo drug rehab, skills training and other programmes to help them reform. Owners of dangerous dogs that maul children on private property will face jail. The government is closing a  loophole which has left police unable to bring prosecutions even in  fatal cases. The new law will also apply to attacks on postmen and other visitors to private houses or gardens. Ministers defied the anger of Middle England as they unveiled plans to ‘fast-track’ the Government’s controversial £33billion high-speed HS2 rail scheme. The Government said it was ‘cracking on’ at a pace with the flagship project, insisting: ‘It will become a matter of when, not if, the entire 351 miles of new railway will be built.’","New measures include GPS tags for paedophiles, resettlement jails and compulsory drug testing .

Fines will be increased by 50 per cent to £90, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin indicated yesterday. However critics said the higher penalty has to be backed up by tougher enforcement as texting by drivers is now rife. Announcing the crackdown, Mr McLoughlin admitted he had used a mobile phone to make calls while driving, although he would not do so now. Crackdown: Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin has indicated that motorists who put lives at risk by sending text messages at the wheel are to face tougher penalties (file picture) But he found it 'unbelievable' that motorists risk a fatal accident by texting, tweeting or using Facebook at the wheel – more distracting than being over the drink-drive limit. Ministers plan to increase the fixed penalty for the offence of using a hand-held device while driving – whether to text or make calls – from £60 to £90, Mr McLoughlin revealed. The number of penalty points offenders receive on their licence will remain at three. There had been calls for the 150,000 or more drivers a year convicted of offences involving mobile phones to incur a six-point penalty. The higher fine will also apply to a range of other fixed penalty offences, including speeding and running a red light. Ministers plan to increase the fixed penalty for the offence of using a hand-held device while driving - whether to text or make calls - from £60 to £90 (file picture) Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin found it 'unbelievable' that motorists risk a fatal accident by texting, tweeting or using Facebook at the wheel . A new fixed penalty of a £90 fine plus . three points will be introduced for careless driving such as cutting up . other drivers, tailgating, middle-lane hogging, eating a sandwich or . lighting a cigarette at the wheel, or driving at an inappropriate speed. New drug-driving laws will also be brought in, although the current drink-drive limit will not be lowered. Mr . McLoughlin said: 'We want to send a clear message to dangerous drivers: . If you continue to show complete disregard for the safety of other road . users, we will catch you – and we will punish you.' Speaking at a road safety conference in London, Mr McLoughlin admitted: 'On occasions in the past I've used my mobile phone when driving.' But just as drink-driving had become socially unacceptable, he would not now condone it. The idea that 'we all do it, don't we?' was no longer acceptable, he said. Any use of a hand-held device while driving, other than to make an emergency call, has been illegal since 2003.  This applies in road jams or at traffic lights. The only time it is legal is if you are safely parked. More than a million motorists have been convicted of using a hand-held mobile phone behind the wheel since 2003, with a peak of 161,096 convictions in 2010. An AA/Populus poll found that 42 per cent of drivers admit using hand-held mobiles illegally and 20 per cent admit to having sent a text at the wheel. Research carried out for Which? found that texting and tweeting at the wheel caused a 79 per cent drop in the driver's attention – up to seven times more than in someone at the legal drink-drive limit. Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said: 'With both texting and hand-held use of mobile phones at the wheel causing more impairment than being at the drink-drive limit or under the influence of cannabis, the police need to target the large number of motorists continuing to flout the law.' In March, Metropolitan police commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said that drivers caught using a mobile phone should receive six penalty points so that a second offence would trigger a ban.","Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin indicates fines to increase 50% .

Poisoned: Kieran Cockburn, 36, was found dead by his worried boss after he failed to show for work . A chef was killed by deadly fumes from a disposable barbecue lit in 'mysterious' circumstances inside his flat. Kieran Cockburn, 36, from Beast Banks, Kendal, was found dead by his worried boss after he failed to show for work at the Castle Green Hotel, Kendal, Cumbria, an inquest heard. Police found the burnt-out grill on a coffee table in his apartment shortly after midday on May 31. Although South and East Cumbria coroner Ian Smith said the barbecue was given as the cause of death by a pathologist - mystery surrounds exactly why it was there. He recorded a open verdict at Kendal County Court on November 29th. He said there was no explanation for the barbecue’s presence and explained there was insufficient evidence to conclude Mr Cockburn placed the grill indoors deliberately to kill himself, or that he had been cooking on it inside oblivious to its danger. It follows several deaths caused by the devices nationwide this year, including one at Ullswater in March. Inspector Rob Lampard - the first officer on scene at Collin Croft, off Beast Banks, Kendal - said Mr Cockburn’s death followed national publicity about a child who had died after falling asleep near a disposable barbecue while camping in Shropshire. Inspector Lampard told Mr Smith that there ‘didn’t seem to be any reason’ for the barbecue to be in the flat because it appeared no food had been cooked on it and he found the remains of a Chinese meal nearby. The inquest heard from Mr Cockburn’s GP, Dr Michael Brennan, who said his patient had suffered from the ‘unpleasant’ bowel condition Crohn’s disease since he was 30, had undergone ‘big surgery’ because of it and was taking quite a lot of medication. He said that in the months before his death, Mr Cockburn said he was ‘feeling down’ and waking up during the night so he was prescribed sleeping tablets and anti-depressant drug mirtazapine. But Dr Brennan told the hearing Mr Cockburn gave no indication he wanted to take his own life. Grace Williamson, Mr Cockburn’s manager at the Castle Green Hotel, where he had worked since September 2005, said he was sent home poorly on the evening of Saturday, May 26 and was off work sick the day after. Failed attempts were made to contact him during the week but when he could still not be reached by Thursday, she visited his flat where she found him dead. Mr Smith suggested Mr Cockburn might have brought it inside to keep warm - something he described as a ‘bad idea’ - or to cook, although there was no remnants of food. And he ruled out any third party involvement. 'I am well short of the necessary certainty that Kieran did this perhaps with the intention of killing himself,' said Mr Smith. 'He was feeling low but there’s no indication he was suicidal. 'It could be that he was doing something really not advisable with the barbecue because they are, as we have learned, potentially lethal in an enclosed space.'","Coroner Ian Smith recorded open verdict and said he did not know why barbecue was in the flat .

Drivers should be charged more for parking to make them walk instead, health chiefs said yesterday. New guidelines say going by foot or bicycle should become the norm for short journeys to work, school and the shops. Families should even consider selling their car to end the ‘bad habit’ of using it for trips of less than a mile. It's good for you! Raising parking fees will encourage people to get out of their cars according to NHS advice . The advice from NICE, which sets national standards for healthcare, aims to get Britain fit and reduce disease in later life. Doctors and nurses are told to set a good example ‘through their own . behaviour’ and town halls are urged to ‘restrain’ car use with parking . restrictions and higher fees. The nanny state initiative was condemned as ‘boneheaded meddling’ by Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance. ‘Things are tough enough for taxpayers already without meddling health bureaucrats trying to make parking more expensive,’ he said last night. ‘For most people using the car is a necessity, not a luxury. ‘Parking charges damage the high street, place an unnecessary burden on struggling businesses and make life even harder for households just trying to make ends meet. The new initiative has been condemned as 'boneheaded meddling' which could add to the financial woes of already hard-pressed families . Families should even sell their car to end the 'bad habit' of using it for trips of less than a mile and walk instead . ‘NICE’s boneheaded attempts to interfere demonstrate how out of touch they are with the pressures faced by hard-pressed families.’ The guidelines do not state by how much councils should push up parking fees, which have already been rising steadily. Since 2008, fees have more than . doubled in Doncaster to £1.80 an hour. In Manchester they have gone up . by 40 per cent over the same period to £2.70 an hour. The guidelines do not state by how much councils should push up parking fees, which have already been rising steadily . This year, Westminster increased its . charges, which apply on evenings and weekends, by 40p to £4.80 an hour. But Harry Rutter, an obesity expert at Oxford University who helped draw . up the guidelines, said action was needed to improve the nation’s . fitness levels. ‘Only a minority of people in England get enough physical activity to improve their health,’ he added. ‘This creates a huge and often . difficult burden of illnesses and on people’s quality of life, but most . people seem unaware of the scale of that burden. We all face barriers in . changing our lifestyle and most of us don’t think we have the time or . the inclination to add some extra physical activity into our lives. ‘It can be very difficult to break . old habits and change behaviour. But walking and cycling to work, the . schools, the shops or elsewhere can make a huge difference.’ Mike Kelly, director of the Centre . for Public Health Excellence at NICE, said: ‘As a nation, we are not . physically active enough and this can contribute to a wide range of . health problems. ‘We want to encourage and enable people to walk and cycle more and weave these forms of travel into everyday life.’ The latest advice from the Department of Health states that adults . should do at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise five times a week. But according to the ministry’s own figures, only 29 per cent of women and 39 per cent of men do so. Lack of exercise is strongly linked to obesity, which in turn causes . heart disease and strokes and has been linked to several types of . cancer. There is also evidence that exercise improves mental health and may stave off depression and even dementia. Guidelines say going by foot or bicycle should become the norm for short journeys to work, school and the shops . It is not the first time that NICE, which stands for the National . Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence, has been criticised for its . public health advice. In 2010, it produced guidelines saying all five-year-olds should be taught about sex and contraception. Later that year it urged schools to hold antenatal classes for teenage mothers. NICE, which also decides which drugs should be used on the NHS, has been accused of banning life-extending cancer treatments. Its lengthy decision-making process has led to some drugs being held up in the system for up to nine years.","NICE, which sets national standards for healthcare, wants walking and cycling to 'become the norm' for short journeys to work, school or into town .

Court case: The family of Abu Qatada, pictured, have won an injunction preventing protesters from staging demonstrations within 500 metres of their London home . The family of radical preacher Abu Qatada has won an injunction preventing protesters from demonstrating outside their home. His wife and five children were granted an 'anti-harassment' order by a High Court judge in London. Mr Justice Silber also granted them an injunction against various protest groups preventing them misusing private information about the family - such as their names and address. The judge stressed that his decision did not prevent organisations from protesting against Qatada, provided demonstrations take place more than 500 metres from the London house where they are living. The judge pointed out that Qatada, whose real name is Omar Othman, was not a party to the proceedings. He emphasised that the case was not concerned with whether 'Omar Othman should still be in this country or whether he should be in prison in this country'. Judge Silber also said he was not concerned with whether he or his family 'should be provided with a house financed by the United Kingdom taxpayers'. It was accepted 'that it is perfectly legitimate' for there to be protests about his presence in the country and about the house provided to his family. The injunctions granted today continued earlier orders made by another High Court judge earlier this month. The court action for injunctions was . brought against a number of groups, including English National . Resistance, Britain First and the English Defence League, as well as . against 'persons unknown who are intending to assemble outside the home' of the claimants. He said evidence showed that the . claimants, including two children under the age of 16, 'have suffered . extreme distress and upset by the actions of demonstrators outside their . home'. He added that such protests directly outside had 'terrified' the family, particularly the younger children. Court hearing: The High Court ruling upheld an earlier court decision and rejected an appeal from a number of groups including the English Defence League and Britain First . The judge said he accepted the . evidence presented on their behalf that, while demonstrations were . taking place, they were 'effectively prisoners in their own home'. Justice Silber added that defendants aimed 'to cause as much misery, not only to . Omar Othman, but also to his family'. He added there was 'powerful evidence' from the . claimants of weekly demonstrations 'with much shouting of abuse' such . as 'Abu Qatada off our streets', 'All Muslims are terrorists' and 'Just . murder him' - with chanting and shouting lasting for up to six hours. In opposing the injunctions, the defendants . argued that the orders would interfere with their rights under the . European Convention on Human rights - in relation to freedom of thought, . expression, and of assembly and association. Rejecting their case, the judge . pointed out that each of those rights 'is qualified in the sense that . they do not apply in certain circumstances such as where they interfere . with the rights of others'. As well as the 'anti-harassment' order, he granted a second injunction restraining the defendants from . communicating or disclosing personal matters relating to the wife and . children, such as their address, names, names of schools, and also . images of them. The injunction were brought against a number of groups including the English Defence League the English National Resistance and Britain First (stock image) Their case was that if the defendants . were allowed to communicate such information it was likely to result in . further harassment. A previous court order already prohibited the release of Qatada’s address into the public domain. Last year, Siac judges ruled that . evidence from Qatada’s former co-defendants, Abu Hawsher and . Al-Hamasher, said to have been obtained by torture, could be used . against him in a retrial. They said: 'The Secretary of State has . not satisfied us that, on a retrial, there is no real risk that the . impugned statements of Abu Hawsher and Al-Hamasher would be admitted . probatively against the appellant.' Mrs May immediately pledged to appeal and told the Commons that Jordan had given assurances about its legal processes. She described Qatada as 'a dangerous man, a suspected terrorist, who is accused of serious crime in his home country of Jordan'. Qatada was granted bail following the ruling and released from HMP Long Lartin. Mrs May’s appeal against a decision to allow Qatada to stay in the UK is due to be heard on March 11. He has fought deportation to Jordan -  where he was convicted of terror charges in his absence in 1999 - for more than a decade.

"By . Graham Smith . UPDATED: . 10:27 EST, 19 January 2012 . The first U.S. research centre dedicated to the late British Prime Minister Winston Churchill is to open in Washington, DC. The Churchill Centre, an international group devoted to preserving the wartime leader's legacy, today announced an $8million (£5million) pledge to establish a new National Churchill Library and Centre at George Washington University. Churchill remains an icon for leading Britain to victory during the Second World War and is also widely admired in the U.S. Still making waves: The first U.S. research centre dedicated to Winston Churchill is to open in Washington, DC. Sir Winston Churchill's stature is so gargantuan that polls regularly name him the greatest Briton to have ever lived. The former prime minister famously inspired Britain to stand in defiance of Hitler's Nazi Germany during the Second World War. He will forever be remembered for embodying the strength and spirit of Britain in one of its darkest periods, rousing the public with stirring speeches and broadcasts that gave hope to millions. Born in 1874, Churchill began a career in politics after leaving the army in 1899. He won the Conservative Party seat at Oldham in 1900. However, having become disaffected with the party he joined the Liberals four years later. As President of the Board of Trade in Asquith’s Liberal government he set up labour exchanges and unemployment insurance. As Home Secretary in 1910 he improved safety in the mines and prevented the employment of child miners, although he disappointed radicals by deploying troops in Wales during a miners' strike. Churchill became Prime Minister in May 1940, when Britain was at war with Germany, following the resignation of Neville Chamberlain. He led the embattled nation until July 1945, and again between October 1951 and April 1955. He died on January 24, 1965 and was given a state funeral. Since his death, Churchill’s stature has continued to grow. He was recently voted ‘Greatest Ever Briton’ in a major BBC poll, beating Isambard Kingdom Brunel and Charles Darwin. Rare books and research materials will be transferred to the university's library and the centre will be created between 2013 and 2015. The gift will create endowments to support a professor and a curator devoted to Churchill and to 20th century British history. From the gift, $2million (£1.3million) will be devoted to renovating space for the Churchill centre and $1million (£650,000) will fund exhibits and programmes. George Washington University president Steven Knapp said the centre will become a destination for scholars and students of Churchill along with Washington's many museums, archives and libraries. He said: 'We're going to be able to study the 20th century through the study of one of the towering figures of the 20th century, Winston Churchill. 'The idea here is to look at him not just in isolation but also setting him in his life and times.' Born in 1874, Churchill's career in . politics spanned 60 years, and he served in Britain's parliament, . numerous executive posts and as prime minister for 10 years. He died in . 1965. The Churchill . Archives Centre at the University of Cambridge is the primary repository . for his documents and personal papers with over a million items. Other . major Churchill institutions in Britain include the Churchill War Rooms . and Museum and Chartwell, the Churchill family's home. Much . of Churchill's memorabilia has never been shown in the U.S., so the new . centre could borrow materials from the British institutions. Members . of the U.S.-based Churchill Centre will build a collection to be housed . in Washington, said Lee Pollock, the group's executive director. Prestigious: The Churchill Centre today announced an $8million pledge to establish a new National Churchill Library and Centre at George Washington University (pictured) Several . members have personal collections they want to donate to a permanent . library, rather than sell. The Washington collection could amass more . than 1,000 volumes, he added. 'Americans are especially devoted Churchillians,' Mr Pollock said. The . British icon is 'probably the most collectible and collected statesman' of at least the last century, having written over 15million words and . about 50 different books as a historian and writer, he added.",$8m pledge for George Washington University library .

Nineteen days after Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev died following a gun battle with police, there remains a question mark over where his body will be laid to rest. The chief of police in Worcester, near Boston, has called for a resolution, complaining that it is costing tens of thousands of dollars to protect the funeral home where Tsarnaev’s body is currently being kept amid protests. ‘The police department is expending resources that could be used for other needs in our community,’ Police Chief Gary Gemme said. ‘Beyond this there is a need to do the right thing. We are not barbarians. We bury the dead.’ Worcester Police Chief Gary Gemme has complained that it is costing tens of thousands of dollars to protect the funeral home where Tsarnaev's body is currently being kept amid protests . He has called for unspecified officials to wade into the issue, which has dragged on for several days and triggered protests at the Main South funeral home. ‘I am publicly appealing to those with authority to provide a burial site to do so and do so quickly,’ he said. Tsarnaev was fatally wounded in Watertown, just outside Boston, after police confronted him in a stolen car. He was shot several times by police, then was run over with the car by his fleeing brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, his accomplice in the deadly April 15 bombing, authorities have said. Tamerlan Tsarnaev's body was released by the state medical examiner May 1 and has been in limbo since. Tsarnaev's widow had wanted his body turned over to his side of the family, which claimed it. Police Chief Gary Gemme, right, has called for a resolution over the burial of suspected Boston bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev . Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, mother of Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, has reportedly told the director of the funeral home that she would now prefer to bring the body back to Russia for burial . A deal had been struck Monday to bury the remains of Tsarnaev, a 26-year-old ethnic Chechen from southern Russia, at a state prison site, but it dissolved after state officials stopped cooperating Tuesday, Gemme said. Peter Stefan, whose funeral home accepted Tsarnaev's body last week, said Tuesday that none of the 120 offers of graves from the U.S. and Canada has worked out because officials in those cities and towns don't want the body. The suspect's mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, reportedly told the director of the funeral home that she would now prefer to bring the body back to Russia for burial, even though doing so would cost thousands of dollars. But there is no guarantee Tsarnaeva would even get a chance to see her son, reports ABC. Russian authorities could declare Tamerlan Tsarnaev a terrorist and deny his family their right to claim the body, according to the Russian legal experts, including one who is advising the family. Protesters stand across the street from Graham Putnam & Mahoney Funeral Parlors in Worcester, they are upset about the possibility that Boston marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev may be buried in the U.S. The family would be presented only with a certificate stating that he had been buried by the government. An . expert in U.S. burial law said the resistance to Tsarnaev's burial is . unprecedented in a country that has always found a way to put to rest . its notorious killers, from Lee Harvey Oswald to Adam Lanza, who gunned . down 20 children and six educators at a Newtown, Conn., elementary . school last year. ‘It's very unusual that people are so fixated on this,’ said Tanya Marsh, a Wake University professor. ‘There . are a lot of evil people buried in marked graves in the United States. Traditionally, in the United States, ...when somebody dies, that's the . end of their punishment.’ A solution may be found in Massachusetts law, which requires a community to provide a place to bury someone ‘dying within its limits.’ Decision time: Peter Stefan told a news conference on Monday that a decision had to be reached after the city of Cambridge refused to bury the body of suspected bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev there . Fiona Gilley, left, and her sister Nairi Melkonian, both of Worcester, Mass., hold signs urging compassion while they stand on the other side of the street from protestors on Sunday . Tsarnaev . lived in Cambridge, across the Charles River from Boston, but was . pronounced dead at a Boston hospital, meaning Boston would be obligated . to bury him under a straight reading of the law. But . Marsh said there's a better legal case to bury the body in Cambridge . because, in practice, where a person lived has been the key factor in . determining the place of burial. Cambridge's rules for buying a grave at the municipal cemetery require that ‘the deceased must be a Cambridge resident,’ according to online guidelines of the Cambridge Department of Public Works. Boston also makes residency the key requirement of its cemetery burial rules. ‘It's been the city's contention that he was not a Boston resident and therefore should not be buried in the city of Boston,’ said John Guilfoil, a spokesman for Mayor Thomas Menino. But Cambridge's city manager has urged the Tsarnaev family not to try to bury Tamerlan Tsarnaev in the city, citing the potential massive disruption. A city spokeswoman said Wednesday that nothing had changed. Angry: Dozens of protestors have begun picketing Stefan's business, like Scott Schaeffer-Duffy, pictured, who crossed the Boston marathon finish line minutes before the bombs detonated .

Accused: Carol Velasquez, 49, pictured, was arrested on Tuesday on the charges, which relate to the labor and delivery of children in Indiana during 2009 and 2010 . A South Carolina midwife linked to the death of an Indiana newborn in 2010 has been indicted on 17 felony charges of unlawfully practicing medicine and obtaining and procuring legend drugs. Carol Velasquez, 49, of Aiken, was arrested on Tuesday on the charges, which relate to the labor and delivery of children in Indiana during 2009 and 2010. She was indicted by a Marion County grand jury. The midwife was named in a March 2011 Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department report involving the death of a baby boy. the child's mother is one of four victims identified in the grand jury indictment handed down on March 28. It is unclear what role Velasquez played in the baby's death and the report says the case is still ongoing. The child's parents, who MailOnline has chosen not to identify, were clearly distraught after the death of their newborn on December 20, 2010. The father posted a photograph of their deceased son on Facebook on Christmas day 2010, with the caption: '(My wife) is home today. She is starting the healing process now. We are grateful for friends and family. We are grateful He has us in His hands. We have some pics of out boy, here is one.' The little boy looks peaceful, wrapped in a white and blue hand-knitted blanket alongside a statuette of a couple embracing and a stone engraved with the word 'Love.' Friends and family posted comments under the tragic photograph, comforting the mourning couple, who are in their 40s and appear to be foster parents to older children, telling them they're in their prayers. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Emotional: Velasquez, pictured left, appeared emotional in the courtroom on Tuesday . Hiding: The midwife rubbed her eyes and hid from cameras as she appeared in court . Yesterday's indictments allege Velasquez . administered the drugs cytotec, which can induce labor; T4 and T3, . thyroid medications; and pitocin, which can strengthen labor . contractions and control bleeding, to women she was assisting in 2009 . and 2010. Deputy Prosecutor Kristina Korobov said: 'The primary concern there is the prescription of drugs, essentially turning a home birth into a hospital birth except you are doing it in a home and without the proper training for it. 'These are things a doctor would do, specifically administering drugs internally to a patient. And that's extremely concerning when you see stuff like that happening.' According to the indystar.com, Velasquez is listed on the South Carolina Department of Heath as a licensed midwife, with her license extending from October 14, 2011 until October 31 this year. Supporters: Supporters rallied for Carol Velasquez outside the court, pictured . In South Carolina, a midwife is not . required to be a nurse however Indiana's more strict rules do require . this and if the certified nurse midwife wants to prescribe medicine, . they must work in collaboration with a doctor. Velasquez turned herself in and was released on $15,000 bond. At her court appearance on Tuesday, the woman looked emotional as she entered a preliminary not-guilty plea. Supporters of the midwife waved placards outside the City-County Building claiming the charges were unfair. 'I think they are completely false and not true. I've worked with Carol. I know her to be an upstanding citizen,' Angie Herzberger, Velasquez's friend, told theindychannel.com. 'I have never seen her use any illegal drugs. She uses only natural methods.' Sarah Reeves, another friend of Velasquez, said: 'They really should be going after dangerous people, not people like Carol. She's done nothing but help people.' Velasquez, who has been living in Aiken for the past two years, did not talk to reporters, but her husband, Marty Velasquez, insisted she was innocent. 'You can tell by the crowd around she is well-respected and well-loved,' he said. A pre-trial conference is set for May 28 in Marion Superior Court.

A popular janitor at a South Florida gym has been revealed to have been living a secret life as a serial bank robber up until his death earlier this month. Michael J. Webb, 56, had recently been promoted from head janitor to facilities supervisor at LA Fitness in Deerfield Beach and was described by his boss as reliable and someone who could be trusted to do the right thing. In fact, Webb was a career criminal who had been in and out of prison since his early 20s. Popular employee: Slain banker robber Michael Webb (right) with baseball star Manny Ramirez at Deerfield Beach LA Fitness where he worked . Career criminal: Webb had been in and out of prison on a number of occasions since his early 20s . ‘If the power went out, or something . broke, I would call Mike and he would know exactly what to do,’ Sean . Lynch, the gym's general manager, told The Sun Sentinel. ‘So when the FBI walked in, showed me his picture and told me he was dead, it hit me like a ton of bricks.’ Webb died on Nov. 2, gunned down after a car chase with police when his final robbery went terribly wrong. Police had dubbed Webb the ‘counter jumper,' after he had carried out a spate of five local robberies in as many months. But Webb’s attempt at a sixth local robbery, turned out to be his last. Police say he traveled just four miles from his home to the Chase Bank in Pompano Beach, a branch he had already robbed twice before. Webb walked into the branch wearing a ski mask and carrying a gun only to find that a bullet-proof glass partition had been erected since his last visit. Realizing that he wasn’t going to be successful this time, Webb rushed from his bank and fled onto the northbound interstate in his truck. With police giving chase, Webb's blue Dodge Ram spun and rolled onto a grassy area. When he began to crawl out of the overturned truck with a gun in his hand, two deputies opened fire on him. Bandanna Bandit: Over a seven-month period in 1989 and 1990, Webb robbed 11 South Florida banks . Caught in the act: Police had dubbed Webb as the 'counter jumper' for his recent spate of bank robberies . Almost 20 years before his recent crime spate, Webb was been known to police by another nickname – the Bandanna Bandit. Over a seven-month period in 1989 and 1990, Webb had robbed 11 South Florida banks, including seven in Fort Lauderdale, stealing more than $100,000. Gym co-owners Lynch and Mike Smith say they had know of Webb’s distance past as a bank robber, but had been convinced by him that he had gone straight a long time ago. On occasion Webb had shared details about his past over a beer after work. They knew he had done time in prison, was estranged from two sons, and that despite a mainly cheerful manner at work, he could also get depressed and moody. Local crime: Webb was attempting his third robbery at the Chase Bank in Pompano Beach, just four miles from his home . After a police chase Webb¿s vehicle spun and rolled onto a grassy area and two deputies opened fire on him . Webb first served time for unarmed robbery in his hometown of Providence, R.I. Once out he was soon busted for armed robbery and was sent back for another six years. After moving to South Florida, Webb was arrested in 1986 on a second-degree attempted murder charge, and served 3 1/2 years in state prison. As the ‘Bandanna Bandit’ he was caught in 1990 in a chase similar to the one that ended his life. Webb first worked at LA Fitness in 2008. Lynch and Smith were so impressed with Webb, that they rehired him in 2010 after he had been jailed for several months on a domestic battery charge that was later dismissed. Webb earned his trust, Lynch said, and he even had his own security key. Just days before his demise, Webb had been promoted from lead janitor to facilities supervisor. The new role would boost his pay from $14 to $18.50 an hour, with full benefits, medical and dental.

Stuart Hazell, the boyfriend of Tia’s grandmother, then hid her body in bin bags in the loft, where it was found a week later. The Old Bailey heard that in the weeks before her death Hazell, 37, who was obsessed with paedophile websites, had repeatedly filmed Tia as she slept – and on one occasion as she rubbed cream on her legs while in her underwear.

Tia’s mother Natalie Sharp wept and rushed from the courtroom as footage of her daughter was played. Later the jury was shown a picture of Tia naked, which the prosecution alleges was taken by Hazell after he killed her. Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC said Hazell, . who regularly searched paedophile websites and had a collection of . graphic child abuse images, took the picture for his ‘sexual excitement’ between 3am and 6am on August 3 last year while Tia’s grandmother . Christine was out working a night shift at a care home. Accused: A court sketch of Stuart Hazell flanked by two guards in the dock at the Old Bailey on the first day of his murder trial .

Relatives of Tia and two jurors sobbed after the image was shown to the court. Hazell, of New Addington, south London, denies murder. Leaving: Natalie Sharp and David Niles leaving the Central Criminal Court, Old Bailey, in London . Outlining the case against him, Mr . Edis said Tia, who regularly stayed at Hazell’s house, had suffered a . ‘sudden and violent’ death. Pathologists believe she was . suffocated but cannot be certain as the body had started to decompose by . the time it was found, he said. While on remand at Belmarsh Prison, Hazell told guards that Tia had broken her neck accidentally falling down the stairs. But pathologists were unable to find . any evidence of a broken neck or skull fracture consistent with dying . from a fall, Mr Edis said. ‘What we know is that after she died . he put her in the loft,’ he said. ‘That’s not what you would normally do . with someone who has suffered an accident.’ When Tia was reported missing, Hazell told her family and police that he had seen her leaving his house to meet a friend. Relatives, friends and neighbours carried out a huge search. During the week-long hunt, Tia’s mother went to stay at Hazell’s house, unaware that her daughter’s body was hidden upstairs. Hazell even made a TV appeal for Tia’s . safe return and criticised those who suggested he had something to do . with her disappearance. Emotional: Both Tia's parents, mother Natalie Sharp, left, and father . Steven Carter were at the Old Bailey today for the first day of Stuart . Hazell's murder trial . Relative: Christine Sharp, the grandmother of Tia Sharp, was the girlfriend of Stuart Hazell when Tia went missing . In an interview Hazell gave to ITV he . appealed for Tia’s safe return, insisted she was like his own child, . described her as ‘a golden angel’ and said he did not know what had . happened to her.

More celebrities could be arrested and charged with historic sex abuse offences, one of Britain's top prosecutors has hinted. Nazir Afzal, Chief Crown Prosecutor for the North West, supervised the case against former It's A Knockout presenter Stuart Hall, 83. He has also recently approved the the charging of Coronation Street stars Bill Roache and Michael Le Vell, who both facing upcoming trials over alleged child abuse. More to follow: Nazir Afzal, Chief Prosecutor for the North West, said he expects more arrests and charges for historic sex crimes . Le Vell, 48, denies 19 . sex offences with a child while Roache, 81, denies child sex charges . relating to five alleged victims in the 1960s. But Mr Afzal acknowledged these cases could just be the 'tip of the iceberg'. He said: 'I don't know how big the iceberg is . but what I do know is that in the last year I have dealt with more . historical abuse cases than I have ever dealt with in my life. 'I think that is true of us as an organisation nationally. 'Yes there will be more cases and I have no qualms about it and neither am I ashamed of it.' Mr Afzal, who also oversaw the landmark prosecution of the Rochdale sex gang, dismissed claims by critics that the pursuit of historic sex abuse cases has become a 'witch hunt'. Charged: Coronation Street actors Michael Le Vell, left, and Bill Roache, right, are both set to go on trial over alleged child sex offences . He insisted such vile behaviour cannot simply be judged as being from 'another . time'. He made reference to the recent Michael Brewer case - the former BBC choirmaster who was jailed for child sex offences. One of his victims, Frances Andrade,  a 48 year-old mother-of-four, committed suicide during his high-profile trial. Mr Afzal said: 'Children are children and they always have been . children. Compelling: Mr Afzal said the case of Stuart Hall showed that victim's testimony alone is enough to bring charges for historic sex offences . 'It really came home to me and I hope it comes home to other people following Frances Andrade's tragic death. 'She lived with the abuse she suffered for 34 years and I know from speaking to her family how it impacted on her all her life. 'Just because it happened all that time ago does not mean that we should not deliver justice. 'The fact that they were not able to talk about it for years is our failure - not theirs.' However, Mr Afzal acknowledged that historical sex cases are more difficult to prosecute because they often amount to 'one person's word against another'. He said: 'It's more challenging but not impossible. 'Recent cases have shown that when you deal with recent allegations of sexual abuse you would ordinarily expect physical evidence, medical, or forensic evidence you might even have witnesses or CCTV. 'All of that is unusual in historical cases. What we do have is very clear accounts from complainants saying what happened to them several years ago. 'That's not enough for us, we have to ensure the defendant gets a fair trial - it's a balancing exercise. 'There are many occasions when people criticise us for taking a bit of time over it but ultimately we want to make sure that only the right cases are brought to court with the right charges.' Referring specifically to the case of Stuart Hall, Mr Afzal added: 'And then, as recent examples have shown, they can so strong and so compelling the defendant can plead guilty and that means it spares the victim from having to give evidence in the first place.' Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Nazir Afzal, head of CPS in North West, says 'there will be more cases'

When a devastating fire left his baby daughter's tiny body covered in burns, Paul Calvesbert feared he would lose her forever. But not only did Terri defy the odds to survive her nightmare ordeal, the now 16-year-old has grown into a determined young woman preparing to embark on a bright future. Proud Mr Calvesbert has described his teenage daughter, who suffered 90 per cent burns when a blaze ripped through her childhood bedroom in 1998, as 'a real fighter'. Academic ambitions: Terri Calvesbert, who suffered horrific burns in a fire as a baby, is preparing to leave school and go to college . Now the 40-year-old is preparing to watch his pride and joy leave Westbourne Sports College, enjoy the school prom and start the next exciting chapter of her life. Mr Calvesbert, of Ipswich, Suffolk, said last night: 'Seeing Terri leave school is a huge deal, I am so proud of her. 'I never thought I would see her start school let alone get to this stage. 'In the early days I never thought I would see Terri grow up but she is a real fighter. 'She has exceeded everyone's expectations.' Pride: Paul Calvesbert described his daughter Terri, seen left with her father and right before the devastating fire, as a 'real fighter' Terri said: 'It is fairly scary, leaving school. 'I have made some great friends - they have always looked out for me,' she added. The inspirational youngster has overcome challenge after challenge in the face of extreme adversity, and is now looking forward to a bright future. Nonetheless the student said her last day at Westbourne Sports College will be full of mixed emotions. Terri sustained horrific injuries as a baby when a fire broke out in her bedroom just days before her second birthday. Tragically, the devastating inferno was started by a cigarette her mother, Julie Minter, left by her cot. Baby Terri was left with burns covering 90 per cent of her tiny body, from her face, scalp, neck and chest to her back, arms and legs. Terri survived against the odds, and now, 14 years on, she is set to tackle her next big challenge; an animal studies qualification at Otley College, near Ipswich. Rock: Terri's father Paul said every moment of the night his daughter was injured is etched forever on his memory . 'When I was younger I wanted to work in a hospital helping people, or as an ambulance driver,' said Terri. 'I think it's because I spent so much time at Broomfield Hospital when I was little. 'Then I decided I wanted to work with children and then I realised animals would be easier to work with than kids. 'It is fairly scary, leaving school. I will miss it, I have always enjoyed school,' the student said. 'We have our school prom to look forward to before it all ends, I can't wait. I already have my dress sorted.' Terri admitted other children 'can be mean' but added 'I can cope with them, it's reactions from adults that is harder. 'They should know better.' 'Looking ahead': Dog-lover Terri is preparing to embark on an animal studies qualification at a college in Ipswich . While devoted father Paul and his wife Nicky, 45, who he married five years ago, dote on Terri, the teenager has been through tough times growing up. She has undergone more than 50 agonising operations to stretch her taut skin damaged in the fire. 'I am a young woman now,' Terri said. 'Growing up has been difficult at times, it was harder when I was younger when it was just me and dad. 'It's hard as a girl to talk to your dad about some things, so when dad met Nicky things got a bit easier for me.' Mr Calvesbert, a community fire volunteer, said: 'She is a teenager, and like all teenagers she's had her moments. 'Nicky came along at just the right time. They get on so well, it is very special,' he said. Before making the big move to college Terri is looking forward to her summer holidays and the burns camp she has been going to for the last 10 years. The camps, held in the UK and one this summer in South Africa, have given her vital support. 'We have all faced similar things,' said Terri. While she recalls 'some of what happened' during her nightmare ordeal, for her father, every moment is forever etched on his memory. 'I remember it like it was yesterday,' he said. Last year Terri's mother Julie spoke out about the fire and admitted she is crippled by terrible guilt. Despite a brief attempt at reconciliation, Terri and her mum no longer have any contact.'I tried,' said the teenager, who wears a blonde wig. 'But it didn't work out. I have moved on. 'I am looking forward.' And the future certainly looks bright, as Terri prepares to continue working with young burn victims through her role as ambassador of the charity The Healing Foundation. And as she approaches adulthood, her own healing process will continue. At the age of 18, doctors at the specialist Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford, Essex, have said they can begin the process of rebuilding Terri's face. Various operations will see medics reconstruct her nose, a procedure that requires they wait until her face has fully grown.'I don't want my head to get any bigger between now and then,' Terri jokes. 'I don't really know how I feel about it. 'At the moment I'm not really too bothered but I'm sure I'll think about it more nearer the time.'","Terri Calvesbert suffered devastating burns days before she turned two .

Army chiefs have made an extraordinary appeal to dozens of former paratroopers at the centre of the Bloody Sunday controversy to volunteer their names and addresses to a new investigation by police in Northern Ireland. The move has sparked a bitter backlash from some Parachute Regiment veterans who fear that the identities will become known of those involved on the streets of Londonderry in 1972 when 14 people died. The identities of the soldiers – some now in their 60s and 70s – have been protected by successive inquiries over four decades. Forty-year controversy: Soldiers arrest a man on Bloody Sunday. Army chiefs have appealed to paratroopers involved to volunteer their names and addresses to a new investigation . Police say the new and complex inquiry is expected to last four years and could lead to criminal prosecutions of veteran paratroopers. Last night one former paratrooper, who was on duty on Bloody Sunday, said: ‘This has caused considerable anger and the implications are huge. ‘Even 40 years on some of us are authorised to carry personal protection weapons because of the obvious threat to our lives and those of our families. ‘We see this as a clear warning that the identities of those soldiers doing their duty that day in appalling circumstances and under attack on the streets of Britain are in real danger of leaking out with obvious consequences. ‘The Ministry of Defence is clearly not in a position to guarantee our anonymity so many will be reluctant to co-operate, making the police inquiry something of a farce.’ The identities of the soldiers working on Bloody Sunday have been protected by successive inquiries over four decades . A letter from Caron Tassel, of the directorate of judicial engagement policy at the MoD, is being sent to regimental associations asking for those involved during Bloody Sunday to contact the ministry. It has been sanctioned by the Parachute Regiment’s Colonel Commandant, Lieutenant General Jacko Page. The letter contains the warning: ‘We feel it is only fair to let witnesses know that we may be required to disclose those details to the police at some stage.’ And to the concern of veteran Paras, there is no reassurance that identities will be protected. The letter only says: ‘We are aware that a number of witnesses to the Saville Inquiry were granted anonymity and may be concerned whether the police investigation will affect that. Fourteen people died after paratroopers opened fire on demonstrators in January 1972 . ‘We understand those concerns and will be raising this with the Police Service of Northern Ireland so they can take this into account when planning their inquiry.’ Last month police commanders briefed relatives of the 14 who died after paratroopers opened fire on demonstrators in January 1972 that a new investigation would be launched. It came after they and prosecutors reviewed the findings of the Saville public inquiry. Following a 12-year inquiry costing £195million, Lord Saville found that the killings were unjustified and that none of the dead posed a threat when they were shot. That contradicted the long-standing official version of events, outlined in the 1972 Widgery report, which had exonerated the soldiers. The Saville inquiry prompted David Cameron to apologise to the relatives. Following a 12 year inquiry, Lord Saville found that the killings were unjustified and that none of the dead posed a threat when they were shot . Crucially, statements given by witnesses, who were only identified by a letter, to the Saville inquiry cannot be used as evidence in criminal proceedings. The letter stresses: ‘The purpose of this letter is to reassure you of the MoD’s policy to support its people, whether serving or veterans, in circumstances when their actions, conducted in good faith whilst on operations, come under judicial scrutiny.’ But another former paratrooper, who served in the regiment in 1972, added: ‘We now have known terrorists in our Parliament and we don’t know who to trust. The authorities will not be getting my address and that is for sure.’ Last night the MoD said: ‘We may be obliged to provide the PSNI with details of former soldiers. We will take great care to identify the names that are subject to an anonymity order clearly so that they continue to be protected.’","Move sparked a backlash from those who fear identities will be revealed .

Action: Foreign Secretary William Hague said Britain and France want to be able to ¿take urgent action¿ in the event of future atrocities . Britain will try to tear up the EU arms embargo against Syria next month so weapons can be supplied to rebels in the country, William Hague announced yesterday. The Foreign Secretary claimed chemical weapons have been used in Syria and said Britain and France want to be able to ‘take urgent action’ in the event of future atrocities. He announced that Britain will supply 34 vehicles, including five armoured 4x4s, and 20 sets of body armour to those seeking to overthrow dictator Bashar al-Assad. Mr Hague revealed that he will press the case for an end to the EU arms embargo in talks with foreign counterparts in Istanbul on Saturday. He said no final decision to arm the rebels has been taken, but stressed that Syrian moderates lack weapons that are easily obtainable by the regime and Al Qaeda extremists. The Foreign Secretary told MPs: ‘The use of chemical weapons in Syria would demand a serious international response. 'The UK is increasingly concerned that there is evidence of the use of chemical weapons in Syria. Our policy on Syria cannot be static in the face of this growing calamity.’ He added: ‘We have taken no decision that we would like to send arms to the Syrian opposition but the UK and France argue that we will need further amendments to the EU arms embargo or even to lift it. ‘We need greater flexibility if we decide that urgent action is necessary, for example in response to a specific incident or continued grave deterioration on the ground.’ Desolate: A man walks along a damaged street filled with debris in Deir al-Zor yesterday, which has seen heavy fighting in recent months . Government sources say the UK and France want the embargo lifted to help persuade Russia to stop arming the Assad regime. Under EU law, the embargo has to be adopted by all 27 member nations at the end of May or it will lapse. A senior source said: ‘We want it rewritten or scrapped. The French are with us. The hope  is that that will focus minds  in Moscow.’ Jordan is already spearheading efforts to arm the rebels using weapons paid for by Saudi Arabia. Mr Hague’s words will fuel concerns that Britain risks being sucked into a civil war which has left more than 70,000 dead and which shows little sign of abating. Ruthless campaign: Syrian policemen performing during a live-fire military exercise. A Syrian human rights group today said a key military unit loyal to President Bashar Assad is running secret prisons holding hundreds of suspected regime opponents . Under attack: A member of the Free Syrian Army runs along with two men to take cover from snipers loyal to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad, in Deir al-Zor yesterday . Critics have warned that arming the rebels will be especially problematic because many opposition groups have been hijacked by Al Qaeda supporters. Mr Hague said: ‘There are legitimate arguments against [arming Syrian rebels]. If we were to take that step we would have to assure ourselves to the maximum degree, not only of the legal position but that they could not be misused by other people for whom they were not intended.’ But he added: ‘It must also be a major consideration that a regime that is not bringing the conflict to an end can get weapons, that extremists can get weapons, but that people that are in favour of a free and democratic Syria find it very difficult to do so.’ In addition to the armoured vehicles, Britain will also deliver eight trucks, six SUVs, five pick-ups, a recovery vehicle and four forklifts to the rebels. The equipment is part of a non-lethal package worth less than £3million that also includes 107 generators, 130 solar-powered batteries and civil resilience kits. Mr Hague faced criticism from his own side. Tory MP Dr Julian Lewis said that if the Assad regime fell, the Government could not guarantee that chemical weapons would not fall into the hands of extremist fighters in Syria. ‘It just took a couple of dozen people to organise 9/11,’ he warned.",Foreign Secretary announced support to rebels fighting Bashar al-Assad .

Injured: Tottenham Hotspur's Gareth Bale is trying a controversial treatment to help his ankle recover called Platelet-Rich Plasma Therapy . When Tottenham Hotspur’s star Gareth Bale suffered an ankle injury earlier this month, he turned to a controversial blood-spinning treatment to get himself back on his feet. The technique involves taking a small amount of blood (10-40ml, roughly one or two tablespoons) from a patient’s arm and then spinning it at high speed in a machine called a centrifuge for ten minutes. This high-speed spin causes the blood to separate into its various components. Specifically, it allows platelets (the parts of blood that promote clotting and assist the healing process) and plasma (the liquid part of blood in which red and white blood cells are suspended) to separate from other components in the blood. By removing the other components, it means the concentration of platelets in the plasma is up to five times higher than normal. Known as Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP), it contains large amounts of natural growth factors — substances the body uses to heal tissue. The patient’s PRP is then immediately injected back into the injured area of the body — in Bale’s case, his right ankle. The idea is that it jump-starts recovery, reducing pain and making the injury heal up to five times faster. This quick and easy treatment has been shown to work for a range of ailments, from arthritic joints to foot pain, and it is increasingly being used within the NHS. So should you try blood spinning for your creaky knees and old sporting injuries? Dr Ralph Rogers, a private doctor specialising in sports and orthopaedic medicine at London’s Lister Hospital, believes the treatment holds genuine benefits. ‘Within our blood, we have cells that begin the healing process,’ says Dr Rogers, who has been using the PRP technique for four years. ‘When you injure yourself, the body’s first response is inflammation. This sends platelets to the site of injury, which kick-starts the body to repair itself.’ Drama: Gareth Bale during the Europa League match, when he injured his ankle. He is hoping that it will heal five times faster than normal with the treatment . The ‘super-shot’ of platelets boosts this healing mechanism, he explains, so recovery is faster. Furthermore, this high concentration of platelets seems to enhance healing so that the body produces less scar tissue. Blood spinning — or, as it is technically known, Platelet-Rich Plasma Therapy — has been around since the Eighties, when it was first used following open heart surgery to avoid giving excessive amounts of donated blood products, which could contain disease or trigger an immune reaction. Since then, it has been used in orthopaedics to ease arthritic joints and painful knees, in neurosurgery, wound healing, ear, nose and throat surgery, and face and head surgery. It has even been used in cosmetic treatments, in a procedure called the Vampire FaceLift, which involves injecting a form of PRP into areas of the face to rejuvenate the skin. Treatment: Blood spinning, as in the case of Gareth Bale, has been used to ease painful joints since the Eighties . Earlier this year, the government body NICE (the National Institute for health and Care Excellence) issued new guidelines acknowledging PRP as a treatment for tendon injuries, common in the elbow, knee and ankle, and plantar fasciitis — inflammation of the band of tissue that stretches from the heel to the middle of the foot. This common condition affects around one in ten people at some point in their lives and can be triggered by long periods walking or standing, walking in flat shoes, over-exercising or obesity. Dr Rogers explains that the treatment seems particularly effective at treating tendons, which are notoriously difficult to heal due to their poor blood supply. Effective: The treatment means that there is a five times higher concentration of platelets in the blood, which help the body to heal tissue . Over recent years, the PRP treatment has started to grow in popularity, especially for sports injuries, and is now available on the NHS for orthopaedic problems such as tennis and golfer’s elbow, shoulder injuries and Achilles problems, and privately at around £2,000 for three treatments. Two or more injections may be needed, between four and six weeks apart, depending on the injury. For best results, Dr Rogers says that physiotherapy should be performed alongside the treatment. As yet, it is available in only around a dozen places on the NHS, and there are no figures on how frequently it is used. The slow uptake may be due to the fact that the technique has been mired in controversy, with some experts arguing there is still little proof that it works. Indeed, while NICE says the treatment raises ‘no major safety concerns’, it adds: ‘The evidence on efficacy is inadequate in quantity and quality. Therefore, this procedure should only be used with special arrangements for clinical governance, consent and audit or research.’ Mark Batt, professor of sport and exercise medicine at Nottingham University Hospitals, agrees that more evidence is needed before we can start routinely offering blood spinning to patients. ‘There may be some benefit in the use of these types of injections in the healing process,’ he says. ‘However, it is very difficult to find strong, coherent evidence that it works.’ A study of people with injured Achilles tendons — the fibrous tissue that connects the calf to the heel bone — published in The Journal of the American Medical Association in 2010 found that PRP injections were no more effective than saltwater. Yet some of the world’s top sports stars, including footballer Jermain Defoe and golfer Tiger Woods, have used the PRP treatment for their injuries, and small studies show promising results. Blood supply: The technique, available on the NHS, is particularly effective for healing tendons which have limited blood reaching them . One study of 15 patients with elbow pain published in the American Journal of Sports Medicine found that 60 per cent had improved symptoms after eight weeks, and 81 per cent at six months. There were no adverse effects or complications. Dr Rogers says the UK has been slow to adopt the procedure compared with the U.S. and Europe.‘The English sports medicine community has frowned upon this technique, with many doctors thinking it doesn’t work. As a result, the British have been latecomers to the technique. While it is true there is still much to learn about this treatment,  in general PRP theoretically makes sense: it is the body healing itself.’ In Gareth Bale’s case, Spurs doctors hope PRP will do the trick. With treatment, it is hoped he will miss only a handful of games, and that the forward will soon be back to his top goal-scoring form.","Blood-spinning, in use since the 1980s, increasingly available on the NHS .

Curtis Fortenberry and Terrance Crumley, both 21, face felony murder charges over the fatal incident and their indictment has shed light on the strange circumstances that lead to Hidic's death. They claim she persuaded them to visit the home of her sister's friend and pretend she was a hostage before demanding money from the owner. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Mystery: 17-year-old Claudia Hidic was found shot dead in the backyard of a stranger's home . According to the indictment of Crumleyu and Fortenberry, both men claim that Hidic was the mastermind behind the burglary that lead to her death. Hidic was found dead on the back step's of a friend's home on Overton Park West after a gun battle. Police believe Hidic recruited the two men to rob a friend of hers with promises of quick money. The plan was, according to Fortenberry's statements, to pretend that Hidic was a hostage and they were looking for a man named 'Ghost' who owed them $900. The three knocked on the door of the home and were invited inside, police claim. The resident they were looking for was not home, but six other people were. One of the men inside the home got a gun from the bathroom and a gunfire battle erupted. Fortenberry allegedly told police that he may have accidentally killed Hidic, but his attorney refutes those claims. 'Fortenberry had no intention of shooting Hidic,' Mr Goza said to the Star-Telegram. 'I don't think it's clear from the evidence I've seen that he's the one who shot her.' Crumley's attorney, Warren St. John, also said his client was not involved in the shooting. 'My client maintains his innocence,' he said. 'He didn't participate in any shooting.'

Fortenberry's recent arrest was for burglary, theft, and assault with . bodily injury involving a family member. At the time of Hidic's death, Crumley was on probation because of a theft charge dating back to April. A drug . charge was dismissed at the same sentencing. Hidic, a German national from Bosnia, lived in the area of Fort Worth, Texas with her sister. She studied at Trinity High School in Euless and worked at the Los Jimadores Tex-Mex Tequila Factory in Bedford, Fox 4 reported. She dropped out of Euless after leaving a foster family and moved in with one of her sisters. She had reportedly told people, including the man who lived at the address she died in, that she needed money. Just a few days before her death, the man, who was a friend of her older sister's, had given Hidic a $100 loan, according to the Star-Telegram. 'We had frequently discussed that Claudia needed some direction and counseling,' the 43-year-old, who has not been identified, said. A few days later, she returned to the man's home and asked for $600 more, but he refused. That's when investigators believe she devised her plan to rob him. But police spokeswoman Sharron Neal told the newspaper that he is not a 'person of interest' or a suspect. Investigators combed through the man's residence for two days but did not reveal what they had collected as evidence. Tragedy: Hidic's family said they have no idea what happened.

A little girl at the centre of a 'bizarre' tug of love baby scam will finally today be returned to the London couple who believed she was their miracle baby. High Court Family Division judge Mr Justice Coleridge said the 21-month-old little girl should live with the couple who were the victims of greedy international child traffickers who charged them £6,000 for fertility treatment. The 'God-fearing couple' identified only as Mr.S, 51 and Mr. S, a 50-year-old teacher, had been duped by Nigerian conmen into believing the child - 'O' - was the result of a miraculous conception. After a long legal battle the decision was made to hand the little girl back to the couple who had been duped into thinking she was theirs . They were a couple of the highest calibre and complete integrity who unwittingly had become 'victims of the most appalling scam,' said the judge. After a long legal battle, the judge has given his approval . to O going back to the couple as special guardians and they may be . allowed to adopt her later. He said the couple had conducted . themselves with complete dignity and although victims of a scam it had . achieved what they wanted most of all 'to have a child to look . after.' He went on: 'It is perfectly plain the mother now fully appreciates what was going on and what she has been involved in.' 'On the face of it, the mother from what I know seems a good and experienced mother.' The judge said the 'unfortunate' childless parents were 'happy' to be appointed special guardian for the . moment and to be able to raise the little girl as their own . It was . also important for her to be in a settled home. The couple's ordeal began in 2010 when Mrs S travelled to Nigeria to the God's Gift Maternity Clinic in Port Harcourt, to undergo fertility treatment after failing to conceive in the UK. The woman went to a maternity clinic in Port Harcourt, Nigeria, for fertility treatment as she was so desperate to have another child . The Nigerian couple came to live in England in 1987, and after spending nine years as a couple married in 2002. After fertility treatment had a severely disabled daughter in 1994 who died in 2009. So desperate, 'to the point of obsession', to have another baby it is claimed Mrs S was drugged and led to believe the new born baby she was handed was hers. Mr Justice Coleridge said the honest pair had been tricked by the scam . But after returning to the UK and following a visit to her GP the doctor alerted the authorities of his suspicions that things were not all they seemed. The local authority became involved and following DNA tests it was clear that Mr and Mrs. S were not O's biological parents. 'The mother was apparently stunned when she was told the results,' said the judge. It was confirmed that the 'birth' had been 'staged' in Nigeria and that the child had been stolen or bought from unknown parents in Nigeria. The local social services then took O into care. In a statement Mrs S told the court: 'In January 2011 during what I perceived to be the birth of O, I recall a doctor inducing labour through intravenous drip and I experienced what was labour, a very traumatic delivery and a baby was presented to me covered in blood as would have been normal in a delivery room. 'I felt all the natural manifestations of labour and delivery and my baby, O, was presented to me in the manner described.' She added that after fully cooperating with the DNA test and learning the results and when O was taken from her 'my whole life has been shattered.' She felt as if she had suffered the bereavement of her first daughter all over again. 'In short, I have been depressed and traumatised. 'We have struggled to maintain any level of sanity as I am now convinced that I have been a victim of a very serious fraud by those who have exploited my vulnerability and infertility for their own financial gain.' The judge said the question for him to decide had been whether Mrs S took part in the charade or if she was an innocent victim. The judge said Mrs S 'also described to me how she had been given tablets by the clinic to help with the production of milk for breast feeding and that she had in fact breastfed within hours of the child's birth. 'She ended by emphasising that she had been duped and that at no point did she believe at the time she was involved in a massive con.' Mr S had also given evidence that he thought his wife was pregnant as she had put on weight, and was suffering from fatigue and other symptoms associated with pregnancy. The couple had a strong faith and believed in the power of prayer. The local authority's approach has always been that the mother was a knowing participant. But it was argued that they ignored the fact that Mrs S was a parent who had suffered a tragic loss of one child and had been desperate for a second child for a number of years. The judge said Mr and Mrs S were honest witness: 'Both she and her husband were hoodwinked and are innocent victims so far as their involvement in these matters is concerned. 'They neither knowingly participated in the wrongful removal of the child from her natural mother nor in the wrongful importation of her into this country. 'The highest it can be put, as I find it, is that the mother unwittingly took part in an unorthodox adoption process surrounded by an elaborate piece of play acting.' O is currently a stateless child but it was hoped her immigration status would be resolved shortly.","Woman was 'drugged and made to believe she had given birth' in Nigeria .

Rice imported from some countries, including China (above), contains high levels of lead that could pose a health risk to children, researchers have claimed . Rice imported from some countries contains high levels of lead that could pose a health risk to children, researchers have claimed. US experts detected concentrations of lead ranging from six to 12 milligrams per kilogram in rice from several sources. The highest amounts were seen in rice originating from China and Taiwan. Significantly high levels were also found in samples from the Czech Republic, Bhutan, Italy, India and Thailand. All these countries export rice to the UK. Infants and children consuming the rice would be exposed to lead levels 30 to 60 times higher than the tolerable safety limits set by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), said the study authors. For Asian children, who consume more rice, exposures could be up to 120 times higher. For adults, daily exposure levels were 20 to 40 times higher than the FDA guidelines. 'Such findings present a situation that is particularly worrisome given that infants and children are especially vulnerable to the effects of lead poisoning,' said study leader Dr Tsanangurayi Tongesayi, from Monmouth University in New Jersey. The findings were presented yesterday at the annual meeting of the American Chemical Society in New Orleans. The researchers are still in the process of analysing rice samples from Pakistan, Brazil and other countries. Lead accumulates slowly in the body, and can lead to nerve and kidney damage, as well as anaemia. One study has shown brain shrinkage in workers exposed to lead through their occupations. Long-term lead exposure has been linked to reduced IQ and disruptive behaviour in children. Rice is the staple food of around three billion people worldwide. Because rice is grown in heavily irrigated conditions, it is more susceptible than other staple crops to environmental pollutants in irrigation water. Health fears: Asian children, who eat twice as much rice on average, are most at risk . In the UK, the average person consumes around 5.6 kilograms of rice per year. Consumption in the UK is expected to increase as the ethnic population expands and food tastes diversify. Rice imports account for only about 7% of the rice consumed in the US, which is a major producer and exporter of the grain. Lead contamination results from the take-up of metals and other pollutants found in the soil. It is one of several toxins which is known to have been found in rice in the past. A spokesman for the FSA said: ‘We are not aware of any evidence or research which suggests that the levels of lead generally in rice are a concern.’ She said the European Food Safety Authority recently published a report which found that rice played only a small part in the average person’s exposure to lead through food. She added: ‘We would welcome the opportunity to review the American research. 'However, the levels quoted are much higher than those we have detected here in the EU.’","Czech Republic, Bhutan, Italy, India and Thailand rice also caused alarm .

The girl, who has not been identified, said she was raped in an extra cabin that Dickerson had keys to on board. He had been given access to a second room by crew after his wife had earlier complained about noise. The . 15-year-old girl told authorities that she went to the cabin with a . 15-year-old friend where Dickerson was partying with four teenage boys. The girl said they were given alcohol before her friend was held in the bathroom by one of the teenagers while she was raped. She said that the accused and other attackers took turns holding her down and encouraged each other to 'switch' positions, according to the Orlando Sentinel. At one point during the prolonged attack, someone came to the door of the cabin. She was held on the floor while one of the teenage boys sent the person away, according to reports. The girl was dressed and finally allowed to leave the room. She was treated for her injuries at the on board medical center where a rape kit was done. Carnival alerted the FBI to the incident.

Scientists at Edinburgh University claim sunlight could lower blood pressure and help stop heart attacks and strokes (file picture) Sunlight could lower blood pressure and help stop heart attacks and strokes, scientists claim. They argue the health benefits of the sun’s rays outweigh the risks from skin cancer. Edinburgh University researchers found when skin is exposed to sunlight for just 20 minutes, blood vessels release an important chemical called nitric oxide. This acts to lower blood pressure, reducing the risk of heart attacks, strokes or blood clots. Dr Richard Weller, a senior lecturer in dermatology, pointed out that strokes and heart attacks cause many times more deaths than skin cancer. Around 159,000 Britons a year die from the circulatory illnesses, while skin cancer kills 2,750. His team monitored the blood pressure of 24 volunteers who sat under tanning lamps for two sessions of 20 minutes each. In the first session volunteers were exposed to both UV rays and heat. But for the second session researchers blocked the UV rays, exposing them to heat alone. The volunteers’ blood pressure dropped significantly after the first session, but not the second. This implies it is UV radiation, not heat, which is responsible for the beneficial effects. The researchers believe sunlight unlocks nitric oxide stored in skin and widens arteries. Both effects lower blood pressure. Dr Weller will present his findings on Friday at the International Investigative Dermatology  conference in Edinburgh. He said: ‘We suspect the benefits to heart health of sunlight will outweigh the risk of skin cancer.’ He said scientists have known for years peoples’ blood pressure is lower in summer than winter. Additionally, research shows populations of countries far  from the equator, with less sunlight, have higher blood pressure. Dr Weller said it was not a ‘cure’ and it was ‘too early to say’ if people should go in the sun more. While the preliminary research involved only a few people, it will fuel the debate over whether sun exposure is good or bad. The scientists argue the health benefits of the sun's rays outweigh the risks from skin cancer .","Scientists argue health benefits of sun outweigh risks from skin cancer .

Suicide: Richard Balentine, pictured, director of campus ministry at Notre Dame College Prep in Niles, was found hanged at around 9 a.m. yesterday in his home, which is on the school's property . An Illinois high school teacher has been found dead of an apparent suicide on his school's campus, just days before he was slated to receive a prestigious 'Teacher of the Year' award. Richard Balentine, director of campus ministry at Notre Dame College Prep in Niles, was found hanged at around 9 a.m. yesterday in his home, which is on the school's property. The popular 38-year-old teacher had last been seen at around 6 p.m. on Monday night, police said. School spokeswoman Teresa Connelly confirmed that a teacher passed away, but would not provide any more details. She said students were notified yesterday of Balentine's death. Notre Dame staff found Balentine's body in a 'lifeless state in his room' after they entered his residence near the school's sanctuary as classes were commencing, according to Niles police. The teacher is listed on the school's website as the director of campus ministry. Because of his position, he lived on campus. However, police said the area was not somewhere students passed through at any point during the school day. 'The victim appeared to have taken his own life,' police said. Niles police are currently investigating the incident with the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office. According to Bugle Newspapers, Balentine was slated to receive the Teacher of the Year Award from the Niles Chamber of Commerce during the organization's Niles Night of Roses banquet on April 27. School: The teacher was a popular member of faculty at Notre Dame College Prep, pictured in Niles, Illinois . Parent Christine Majewski Wilson said the teacher would be sorely missed by the community. 'Mr. Balentine was a great influence on both my sons, and will be missed terribly. Rest in peace and know that you will be remembered fondly and are loved and thought of by many.' Balentine is listed on website Rate My Teachers for the Niles High School, receiving an overall quality rating of three out of five stars. Most comments were positive with one unnamed person calling him 'a saint' in a 2012 review. Lifeless: Notre Dame staff found Balentine's body in a 'lifeless state in his room' after they entered his residence near the school's sanctuary on Tuesday . 'Mr. Balentine is a saint.

He can make any class fun, you learn more with him than any other teacher. If you take his class seriously he will treat you with respect. I wonder if it hurt when he fell from heaven.' The teacher had been at the school since at least 2010. Balentine had 'liked' a page called 'Suicide Prevention' on Facebook, which may have indicated he was struggling with depression. Under the profile picture, friends wrote condolences after hearing the tragic news.

West Coast beachcombers are likely to stumble across some gruesome discoveries over the next few months, as experts warn that human remains are set to reach the shore. Dozens of bones are expected to wash up as part of the jetsam from last year's Japanese tsunami. In total, an estimated 1.5million tons of debris is believed to be on the 3,500-mile journey from Japan to Alaska and other parts of North America. Cluttered: Tsunami debris washed up on Montague Island, Alaska ahead of a 12-day clean-up mission . Oceanographer Curt Ebbesmeyer warned this week that the findings would include human remains, which will need to handled sensitively by those who find them. 'We're expecting 100 sneakers with bones in them,' he said on Monday at a tsunami symposium in Port Angeles, Washington. Anyone who discovers such remains should call 911 and wait for police. DNA may identify people missing since the tsunami hit Japan in March 2011. 'That may be the only remains that a Japanese family is ever going to have of their people that were lost,' Mr Ebbesmeyer said. 'We're dealing with things that are of extreme sensitivity. Emotional content is just enormous. So be respectful.' Mr Ebbesmeyer is the co-creator of the Ocean Surface Current Simulator computer model, which predicts the movement of ocean flotsam worldwide using known ocean current patterns along with wind speed and direction information provided by the U.S. Navy. Dumped: A fuel canister and a beer crate among the debris on Montague Island, Alaska . One area which is already the focus of an unprecedented clean-up operation after being swamped by rubbish is Montague Island in Alaska. Workers plan to spend 12 days clearing the beach there, which is covered in items including balls, buoys, beer crates, Styrofoam and lunch boxes. Montague, which is the largest uninhabited U.S. island and lies 120 miles southeast of state capital Anchorage, is likely to receive another equally large quantity by the time the year has ended. 'The debris found on initial surveys of the island showed an absolutely unprecedented amount of buoys, Styrofoam and other high floating debris, Patrick Chandler of the Center for Alaskan Coastal Studies told Fox News. So far the wreckage floating away from Asia has included only the odd item - including the bizarre find of a Harley-Davidson and a football that was later reunited with its owner back in Japan. Mess: A barrel and Styrofoam among the flotsam and jetsam on the island 120 miles from Anchorage . Washed up: A sign, left, and a buoy and fuel can found by the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation . Found: A gas bottle that washed up along with other tsunami debris on Montague Island, Alaska . From the air: A view of the island taken from a helicopter . But much bigger quantities are set to arrive thick and fast in the coming months as scientists are now saying the debris will cross the Pacific Ocean far sooner than previously thought. The latest computer models estimate that a vast collection of debris - measuring 4,000 miles across at its longest - will start washing up this October and continue to do so into late 2013. A recent satellite image from NASA's Earth observatory shows the marauding mass sprawled across the ocean's surface. Around 4.8million tonnes - including parts of houses, factories, cars and ships - were pulled into the ocean when the earthquake and subsequent tsunami struck Japan in March last year. While heavy items sank, at least 1.5million tonnes of lighter material such as buoys, oil drums and furniture were carried off by tides and the wind on a 4,500-mile journey to North America. Projections made earlier this year by the International Pacific Research Centre (IPRC), in Honolulu, Hawaii, suggested most of the detritus would begin arriving between March 2013 and March 2014. On fast tides: The latest computer models predict that thousands of tonnes of debris, shown here in a graphic interpretation of a NASA satellite image, from the Japanese tsunami will hit North American shores far sooner than expected . Devastation: The earthquake and subsequent tsunami that struck Japan in March last year washed nearly five million tonnes of debris, including boats, cars and part of houses and factories into the Pacific . Bizarre find: This Harley-Davidson was found on a remote beach on the west coast of British Columbia last week after being swept away by the tsunami last year . Stunned: The owner of the Harley, Ikuo Yokoyama (left), said the discovery by Peter Mark (right) was a miracle . Must have been a wild ride: This motorbike was also found by Peter Mark on Graham Island, western Canada . Journey: The container holding the items travelled 5,000km from Miyagi prefecture in Japan where the Tsunami struck all the way to the coasts of B.C. But predictions from the Japanese government and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has now pushed that date forward to October this year, according to a report in The Guardian. Indeed, many lighter objects began reaching land as early as last November. Last month, a Japanese teenager who lost his home in last year's devastating tsunami spoke of his delight after his football washed up on a remote Alaskan beach 3,500 miles from Japan. Misaki Murakami, 16, came forward to reveal that he was the owner of the ball discovered by American radar technician David Baxter on Middleton Island. Mr Baxter, who also found a volleyball while out beachcombing, now plans to travel with his wife Yumi across the Pacific to return the ball. Can I have my ball back, please?! Japanese teenager Misaki Murakami (left) told of his delight after his football was found by David Baxter (right) on an Alaskan beach. Mr Baxter's wife (pictured) also found a volleyball . Drift: The sports balls were found on Middleton Island, about 70 miles from mainland Alaska . And yesterday, the Japanese owner of a Harley-Davidson motorcycle said its discovery on a remote beach on the West Coast of British Columbia last week was a miracle. The owner, Ikuo Yokoyama, a 29-year-old resident of the town of Yamamoto, in Miyagi Prefecture, was tracked down by a Harley-Davidson representative in Japan who saw the story, first reported by CBC News, the broadcaster reported today. Peter Mark, was combing the beach on Haida Gwaii islands when he made the discovery. A clearer picture of the debris is not expected to emerge before June or July when two privately-funded expeditions are due to travel into the north Pacific. Poignant: Items from the disaster have also been recovered in Alaska, like this sandal . Debris: Toothbrushes are among thousands of items making their way to shore after crossing the Pacific . Washington state officials, which last week released posters advising residents what may arrive on their beaches, say it is highly unlikely any human remains will be found. Washington, Oregon, British Columbia and Alaska will get much of it, while most of California will be protected by currents pushing objects back out to sea, according to The Guardian. Hawaii, however, is in line for several deposits. The US navy and coastguard will be monitoring the debris over fears it could pose a danger to shipping. But for anyone worried that they may wake one day to a tsunami of trash heading towards them, Jan Hafner, of the IPRC, has these words of reassurances. 'Most people probably think there is a huge pile of debris moving across the ocean like a carpet. But it is very sparse, very patchy.'","Workers to spend 12 days removing debris up beach on Alaskan island .

Russia, which Havel criticised for . human rights abuses and democratic shortfalls as recently as this month, . was represented by rights ombudsman Vladimir Lukin. He stepped down as Czech president in . 2003 but remained a symbol of the struggle for freedom and human rights, . although his proclamation that 'truth and love must win over lies and . hatred' turned bitter to some Czechs amid economic hardship and . corruption in the years after the end of totalitarian rule.

Before departing from London this morning David Cameron said: 'Europe owes Vaclav Havel a profound . debt. 'Havel led the Czech . people out of tyranny ... and he helped bring freedom and democracy to . our entire continent.' Bill Clinton's presence was testimony . to his close relationship with Havel, who took him to drink beer in a . Prague pub and play saxophone in a club when he visited in . 1994. Procession: Police stand guard as a line of Catholic priests walk arrive at the funeral ceremony . Holy men: Bishops from the Czech Catholic Church arrive at the cathedral . Sadness: Mourners grieve as they watch the funeral service on a giant screen set up outside the cathedral .

The urn with Havel's ashes will be . buried at his family's plot at the city's Vinohrady cemetery alongside . his first wife, Olga, who died in 1996. Since his death, Czechs have gathered . spontaneously to lay flowers and light candles at key historic sites . such as the monument to the 1989 Velvet Revolution in downtown Prague, . and at Wenceslas Square, where Havel once spoke before hundreds of . thousands of people to express outrage at the repressive communist . regime.

'He was our star, he gave us . democracy,' said Iva Buckova, 51, who had traveled from the western city . of Plzen. 'He led us through revolution. We came to see him for the . last time.' Prague Archbishop Dominik Duka, who spent time in jail with Havel under Communism, was leading the funeral mass. He was joined by Vatican envoy . Giovanni Coppa and bishop Vaclav Maly, Havel's friend and fellow . dissident. Poland's former President Lech Walesa - who led the . anti-communist Solidarity movement - also attended.

Wednesday, over 10,000 mourners had marched through Prague's . cobblestoned medieval streets, led by Havel's actress wife Dagmar, to . pay their respects. Havel, whose dramas of the absurd . were popular in the 1960s before he was banned from public life after . the Soviet invasion in 1968, had felt most at home among artists, . including the Rolling Stones who played in Prague in 1990 just a few . months after the revolution.

Apple has handed a judge a list of eight Samsung products it wants yanked from shelves and banned from the U.S. market after a huge win in a federal copyright infringement case. U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh asked . for the list after a San Jose jury slammed Samsung with a . $1.05billion verdict last week, finding that the South Korean technology giant had . 'willfully' copied Apple's iPhone and iPad in creating and marketing . the products. Samsung plans an appeal of the ruling. Scroll down for video . Just like the other? Apple won a major victory in court after arguing that Samsung devices like the Galaxy S III, right was copied from the Apple iPhone 4s, left . The court victory fueled a surge in Apple's stock, with shares rising 1.88 per cent to $675.68 on Monday. In contrast, Samsung’s humiliating defeat prompted its shares to dive 7.5 per cent, wiping $12million from its value. This represented its largest one-day fall in about four years. The products Apple wants banished from the United States are all smartphones: Galaxy S 4G, Galaxy S2 AT&T, Galaxy S2, Galaxy S2 T-Mobile, Galaxy S2 Epic 4G, Galaxy S Showcase, Droid Charge and Galaxy Prevail. Koh on June 26 banned the Galaxy Tab 10.1 from the U.S. market after finding it likely violated a 'design patent.' Jump in sales: The court victory fueled a surge in Apple's stock, with shares rising 1.88 per cent to $675.68 on Monday . Samsung is now asking for that ban to be lifted after the jury found the computer tablet didn't infringe that particular patent, but it did find it infringed three Apple's software patents that cover the popular 'bounce-back' and pinch-to-zoom features. The judge has scheduled a September 20 hearing to discuss Apple's demands for the sales bans. She asked Apple on Friday to submit the list of products its wants removed from U.S. stores after Samsung complained it doesn't have enough time to prepare for the scheduled hearing. The judge is deciding whether to reschedule the hearing to give Samsung more time to prepare. The South Korean company plans to ask the judge to toss out the jury's verdict as unsupported by the evidence. On the way out? The Droid Charge, left, and the Galaxy Prevail, right, are two of the eight phones Apple has asked to have pulled from stores . Demands: Apple also wants a ban on Samsung's various Galaxy models . Failing that, the company says it will appeal the verdict to higher courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court. In . addition to the sales bans, Apple also plans to ask the judge to triple . the damages to $3.15 billion because of the jury's finding that Samsung . 'willfully' copied Apple. Galaxy S 4G .

Apple filed its lawsuit in April of last year alleging that 28 Samsung smartphones and computer tablets had 'slavishly copied' the iPhones and iPads. Samsung countered with its own claims that Apple used its wireless technology without proper compensation. A nine-person jury in its verdict Friday unanimously agreed with Apple. Most of the damages were tied to Samsung's smartphones. It rejected Samsung's counterclaims. Most of the Samsung products found to have 'infringed' Apple's patent were older devices no longer being sold. The list Apple presented to the court on Monday represent devices it believes are still being sold in U.S. stores, including several versions of the company's popular S2 phones introduced last year. Claims: Apple filed its lawsuit in April of last year alleging that 28 Samsung smartphones and computer tablets had 'slavishly copied' the iPhones and iPads . Samsung's newest and hottest selling smartphone, the Galaxy S3, was not part of the lawsuit and is unaffected by the jury's verdict. The award represents about 1.5 per cent of Samsung's annual revenue. Analysts said the embarrassment of the verdict is a bigger blow for Samsung than the financial setback. Still, the question remains whether Samsung and other Apple competitors will have to redesign their smartphones to avoid infringing Apple's patents. Most analysts agree the verdict sends a threatening message to device makers like Samsung who use Google's Android operating system. Watch video here .

Laughing all the way to the bank: IMF managing director Christine Lagarde criticised beleagured Greeks for not paying taxes, while she earns a tax-free salary herself . The head of the International Monetary Fund enjoys a tax-free income of £350,000, it emerged yesterday – days after she attacked Greeks for failing to pay their taxes. Christine Lagarde provoked a furious backlash after blaming Greece’s economic plight on citizens ‘who are trying to escape tax all the time’. Now it has been revealed that the divorced Frenchwoman, 56, earns a salary of £298,926 which her contract states ‘shall be net of income taxes’. Part of this is paid for by British taxpayers, as the UK contributes 4.5 per cent of the IMF’s resources. This equates to about £13,500 of Mrs Lagarde’s basic wages. The IMF also pays Mrs Lagarde a top-up tax-free sum of £53,490, designed ‘to enable the Fund’s leader to maintain, in the interests of the Fund, a scale of living appropriate to your position as managing director and to the Fund’s need for representation’. In addition, she is entitled to expenses for ‘entertainment’ and travel and hotel costs for her and her partner when the IMF meets in Washington DC. Her five-year contract also entitles her to a pay increase every July. Greek-born economist Vicky Pryce said many people in her home country were astonished by Mrs Lagarde’s hypocrisy. ‘There has been a lot of comment about the irony of the situation,’ she said. Imposing: The headquarters of the IMF in Washington is where representatives of 184 countries aim to work together to foster global monetary cooperation and secure financial stability . She added that Mrs Lagarde had not grasped the true nature of the problems facing the eurozone. ‘If people paid the tax they were due to pay it would make hardly any difference,’ she said. Tax expert Richard Murphy said Mrs Lagarde’s comments were ‘so insensitive’. ‘How can someone who is living tax-free, way beyond the means of the Greek parent who can’t feed their children, say “tough, you’re living in austerity, you’ve got to keep us happy”?’ he asked. He said many Greeks are now withholding their taxes as they believe the country is being run by the IMF instead of an elected government. A spokesman for the IMF said Mrs Lagarde ‘pays all taxes levied on her, including local and property taxes in the US and France’, adding: ‘Fund salaries, like those in most international organizations, are paid on a lower, net-of-tax basis to ensure equal pay for equal work regardless of nationality.’ Contributors: Christine Lagarde earns more than both Barack Obama, left, and David Cameron, right . At the weekend Mrs Lagarde suggested Greece only had itself to blame for its financial situation. She said Greeks could ‘help themselves collectively’ by paying their taxes. ‘I think more of the little kids from a school in a little village in Niger who get teaching two hours a day, sharing one chair for three of them, and who are very keen to get an education . . . because I think they need even more help than the people in Athens,’ she added. Asked if Greeks were experiencing payback for years of bad practices, she said: ‘That’s right.’ She later sought to clarify her remarks, insisting she had been largely referring to the wealthy. The hurried explanation came after a furious response in Greece, criticism from French politicians and a stream of abuse on her Facebook page. Addressing critics on the social network, she said she was ‘very sympathetic to the Greek people and the challenges they are facing’. ‘That’s why the IMF is supporting Greece in its endeavour to overcome the current crisis,’ she added. ‘An important part of this effort is that everyone should carry their fair share of the burden, especially the most privileged and especially in terms of paying their taxes.’","Questioned about Greek crisis head of IMF said country can help itself collectively 'by paying all their tax'

It is the brutal murder of two innocents which has outraged Guatemala - a country where thousands of women have been killed in the past decade, but where 90 per cent of cases are not investigated. Two little girls - one six years old, one 11 -  their tiny dead bodies still wearing pyjamas and clutching rosary beads - dumped in a Guatemalan city street, apparently strangled. Elsewhere in Zona 11, a southern district of Guatemala City,  two women also lay murdered, both shot, one reportedly in the face. Today, as their bodies are laid to rest six days after they were found - they are revealed as family. Scroll down for video . In a brutal murder which has shocked Guatemala - the bodies of a woman, her two children, aged 6 and 11 years old, and her niece, were found on January 16, 2013 in streets south of Guatemala City . Local media named the victims as Carmen Virginia Tuez Franco, 35, her daughters Marbella del Rosario Raymundo Tuez, 6, and Andy Briseida Guadalupe Raymundo Tuez, 11, along with Carmen's niece Silvia Matilde Gaitan Franco, 22 . The little girls Marbella del Rosario Raymundo Tuez, 6, and Andy Briseida Guadalupe Raymundo Tuez, 11, were the children of Carmen Virginia Tuez Franco, 35, who was found murdered nearby alongside her niece Silvia Matilde Gaitan Franco, 22  on January 16. Emotional scenes filled a cemetery in Barberena, 50 km (31 miles) from Guatemala City, as the coffins were carried aloft by crying women before being brought before a mass as family and locals paid their last respects. And although it is not yet known why the girls met their violent end, the pictures of today's emotional funeral serve as a poignant reminder of Guatemala's so called 'war on women'. The deaths of the girls come as Guatemala experiences a surge in the number of murdered women. Some 707 women were killed in Guatemala in 2012, a significant increase from 431 in 2011, according to the human rights group Mutual Support, which tracks violence in that nation, CNN reports. At the time of their killing, the murders of 32 women had already been reported so far this year in just 15 days, while 216 men have been killed in the same period, the human rights group said. People carry the coffins with the bodies of the two women and two girls killed.

Women place candles outside the Public Ministry building as they demand justice for the deaths of the two girls . According to Amnesty International most cases are not effectively investigated and less than four per cent of all homicides in Guatemala result in perpetrators being convicted. Sebastian Elgueta, Guatemala researcher at Amnesty International, said: 'There is no let-up in the cases of killings of women and girls recorded every month, despite the national scandal this has become for Guatemala. The little girls - one six years old, one 11 - were still wearing pyjamas and clutching rosary beads when dumped in a Guatemalan city street, apparently strangled . 'Thousands of cases of killings of women and girls dating from the last decade are still unresolved or end up being archived due to inefficiencies.' Jorge Cabrera, director of Guatemala's National Institute of Forensic Sciences confirmed the children had died from asphyxiation. He said he suspects that organised crime is behind the killing of the two girls, specifically drug trafficking groups who do not care about age or gender, he said. In recent years, Guatemala has had one of the highest per capita murder rates in the world, according to the United Nations: 40 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010. The country is believed to have struggled to cope with an increase of violence generated by drug gangs operating throughout Central America, such as the Zetas from neighbouring Mexico. From 1960 to 1996, Guatemala was engulfed in civil war between left-wing guerrillas and the government. Rape was widely used as a weapon of war to intimidate opponents. More than 200,000 people were killed, most of them by the army. In 2008,  Guatemala passed a law aimed at violent crimes against women, but Amnesty has said the authorities are not making full use of powers. Since 2008 a UN-backed International Commission Against Impunity (CICIG) has been supporting Guatemala's justice system and trying to end a deeply-entrenched culture of impunity. But Amnesty says more needs to be done. Elgueta  said: 'By failing to prevent violence, mount effective investigations and ensure those responsible face justice, authorities in Guatemala are sending the message that abusing and murdering women is allowed. 'Amnesty International calls on the authorities to fully investigate the latest killings of the two girls and two women, and to bring those responsible to justice.","The bodies of two girls were found dumped on a street in Guatemala, dressed in pyjamas .

Lord of the Wind: Italian anti-Mafia police have seized a huge number of assets from energy developer Vito Nicastri, 57, . Italian police have seized more than £1billion in assets from a Sicilian wind farm magnate because of his alleged links to the Mafia. The carabinieri confiscated 1.3 billion Euros from Vito Nicastri, 57, through 43 of his energy companies, 98 properties and several bank accounts. The anti-mafia agency said it was the biggest-ever seizure of mafia-linked assets. As well as warehouses, and villas, Nicastri’s vast portfolio includes luxury cars and a catamaran. Attracted by generous EU and state subsidies and lax controls, the Mafia have increasingly used clean energy as a way to launder dirty money. In the south, where most of the development has taken place, clans have been able to wield its influence to strong arm landowners into accepting the farms, destroying swathes of countryside. Other windfarms, built with public money, have never functioned. Nicastri, dubbed ‘Lord of the Wind’ in Sicily, because of his massive renewables investments, is known to have links to Italy’s most-wanted godfather, Matteo Messina Denaro, who has been on the run since 1993. The Italian anti mafia agency DIA said it was the largest seizure of mafia-linked assets in the country’s history. Agency head Arturo de Felice said: ‘This is a sector in which money can easily be laundered. ‘Operating in a grey area helped Nicastri to build up his business over the years.’ Since 2010 Nicastri has effectively been under house arrest, forbidden from leaving his home town of Alcamo in western Sicily. Italy has the third-largest number of wind turbines in Europe after Germany and Spain . Vito Nicastri has been under virtual house arrest at his home in Alcamo Sicily since the Mafia investigation first began in 2010 . Investigators said the businessman had 'maintained constant relations with . members of Cosa Nostra' in Sicily, as well as having contacts with the . 'Ndrangheta mafia in Calabria, on the Italian mainland. This relationship allegedly 'facilitated his transformation from an . electrician into a businessman specialising in the production of . electricity from renewable sources, giving him a prominent position in . the south', Italy's Ansa news agency reports. The seizure 'impacts in a significant way on the economic power of . Matteo Messina Denaro, who is considered the lord of that land . [Sicily]', the anti-mafia agency said. Ivan Lo Bello, vice-chairman of business lobby Confindustria, wrote on . Twitter: 'Matteo Messina Denaro is behind many businessmen considered . above suspicion who manage and take care of the assets of the real boss . of Cosa Nostra. 'To defeat the Mafia, the fight against money-laundering is fundamental.' Italy banned nuclear power after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster of 1986 and has to buy in much of its energy from Switzerland and France. The country has invested heavily in renewables and has the third most wind farms in Europe, after Germany and Spain.

Jordan White, 17, fell 30ft through a warehouse roof while 'free running' - a thrill seekers sport . A teenage 'free-runner' has been left with severe head injuries after falling 30ft through the roof of a derelict warehouse. Jordan White, 17, from Colchester, Essex, is understood to have been using the abandoned site to take part in free-running -  a thrill seekers' sport in which participants run and jump over buildings and obstacles. Jordan is being treated at Addenbrooke's Hospital, in Cambridge, after suffering severe head injuries and several broken bones. His parents are now keeping a bedside vigil by the critically injured teenager. It is believed the company trying to develop the buildings where Jordan fell were waiting for permission to demolish them after a fire broke out on site just the day before Jordan fell. Father Kevin Grant, speaking from his bedside, said: 'I live near where it happened and his friend came running to get me. 'When I got there I found him lying on the ground. 'All the ambulance and air ambulance staff were terrific. They were there within ten minutes and you couldn't ask for more or fault their level of commitment. 'It is a terrible thing to have happened and I am just trying to be here for everybody until I get the chance to express my feelings.' Jordan, a student at Colchester Sixth Form College, fell 30ft from the warehouse at Rowhedge Wharf, close to his home. Mr Grant, who is at the hospital with Jordan's mother Mary, thanked people who have expressed their love for Jordan by phone, text and social media sites. He said: 'I have been onto his sites thanking everyone for all their kind messages. It is a comfort to know he has so many friends.' It is believed the company trying to develop the buildings where Jordan fell were waiting for permission to demolish them after a fire broke out on site just the day before Jordan fell . Essex Police said they were urging children and teenagers to stay away from the disused warehouses because of the dangers on the site . Isaac Herbert, 16, from Rowhedge, was one of the first people on the scene when Jordan plunged through the roof on Friday. He said: 'I got a call from a friend who said he had fallen through and I raced down to get his dad and we drove to the site. 'His dad was comforting him but he was unconscious and couldn't do anything. 'The paramedics were great.' Isaac described Jordan as funny and charming, and said nobody has a bad word to say about him. He said: 'We are all keeping our fingers crossed. 'I am putting together a book with everyone saying what he means to them so I can give it to him when I see him. 'I don't think the friends who saw him fall will ever get over it.  All my thoughts are with his family. He is like a big brother and my mum says he is one of the family.' A spokesman for Essex Police said they were urging children and teenagers to stay away from the disused warehouses because of the dangers on the site. Firefighters were called to a blaze at the derelict warehouses on Rowhedge Wharf on Thursday night. The next day, Jordan fell through the roof of one of the buildings. Mr Grant and Mike Lilley, borough councillor for Rowhedge, have asked why the site was not more secure. Jordan was free-running, a thrill seekers' sport in which participants run and jump over buildings and obstacles . Friends have described Jordan as funny and charming, and said nobody has a bad word to say about him . Jonathan Hills, managing director of Hills Building Group, which wants to develop the site, said: 'It is very difficult to stop people getting access to the site because there is a footpath running through it and all around the side. 'We are in the process of trying to get the buildings demolished but there is an ecology study that has to be completed before we can get planning permission to tear it down.' He warned people not to enter the building, and added: 'Tresspassing on land and running across roofs is a risk they are taking. 'It is absolutely an tragedy and we will get the buildings down as quickly as we can, but it could be two to three months.' Mr Lilley has contacted Colchester Council's planning enforcement team to see if they can do anything. Jim Howes, who runs the Flight Freerunning Association in Essex and Hertfordshire, has offered advice on how to take up the sport safely. He said: 'I have been doing it about eight years and when I first started it was on the streets and wherever you could find. 'But now there are classes set up all over and Parkour parks all over the place. 'My advice is now there are more places to practise and learn how to control your body before jumping or running across roofs if that is what you want to do.'","Jordan White, 17, from Essex was free-running at abandoned warehouses .

The 50,000-volt volley was fired after he threatened to kill himself while holding a canister of fuel in one hand and a naked flame in the other. Jack Fry, who saw the incident, said: ‘There were three screams. Then we saw a man, fully on fire, from top to bottom, like you see on a film, with his arms swaying around. ‘We saw two police officers appear from the side of the house. One of them jumped on the burning man and put him on the floor. 'The officers were shouting to each other and the one who had put him to the ground got an old duvet or cover and started smacking the man with it.’ The incident – the latest to raise serious questions about the increasing use of Taser weapons – is being investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission. Sophie Khan, a lawyer who specialises in representing Taser victims, said the death was deeply saddening. ‘Police Taser policy clearly states that using one where there is flammable liquid is prohibited,’ she added. ‘We do not know the facts but it is possible this tragedy could have been avoided if the officers had followed standard procedure. ‘It is another incident which . highlights potentially inappropriate use of Taser which is growing as a . weapon of choice among British police forces.’ Family: The father was killed outside his home in Plymouth despite officers attempts to save him . Officers have been warned not to use Taser weapons on people who have been sprayed with CS gas, because some brands catch fire. The confrontation took place outside Mr Pimlott’s home in the Plymouth suburb of Honicknowle on April 18. Responding . to an emergency call about a domestic incident, two officers found Mr . Pimlott in the back garden with the canister. He had poured some fuel . over his body. Warning: Tasers have labels indicating that they should not be used near flammable substances such as petrol . Within moments of the Taser being fired he burst into flames, suffering serious injuries, including the loss of an ear. He was taken to Derriford Hospital in Plymouth and transferred to a specialist unit at the Frenchay Hospital in Bristol where he died four days ago. It is not known whether the two officers involved remain on duty. Mr Fry, a 20-year-old shop worker, said the pair were ‘heroes’ for jumping on Mr Pimlott with blankets in a bid to put out the flames. ‘There was steam coming off him and he was groaning. The sight was sickening,’ he added. ‘The officers then got a hosepipe and poured on water. We heard more sirens and as the paramedics and fire crews arrived I went back inside. I want to say how amazing the officer was. I think this officer is, well, I would use the word hero.’ Another neighbour said: ‘I thought a bomb had gone off. It was a sound like a shot or a bomb. Then I heard a howling noise.’ Mr . Pimlott, who lived with his parents, Kelvin, 61, and Jean, 63, was . known to police after being jailed last December for attacking an . officer. The incident followed Mr Pimlott’s father calling police . because his son was drunk and aggressive. Mr Pimlott, who was jailed for eight weeks, referred to himself as being ‘like Jekyll and Hyde’ when drunk. Devon and Cornwall is one of the . country’s most controversial Taser forces. It used the stun gun 65 times . in 2011 compared with 34 times in 2010. Last year it paid out up to £5,000 in compensation to a man who was Tasered at close range in a packed Plymouth pub. In . a statement last night, Mr Pimlott’s parents said: ‘Dear darling son . Andrew, you were a fantastic son to us, you will always be in our hearts . and thoughts. We will never forget you.’","Andrew Pimlott, 32, suffered horrific injuries and died five days later .

In a document seen by the Mail, officials warn: ‘Dedicated lanes and the time taken to collect the biometrics of GFM (Games family members) may result in delays to non-Olympic passenger journeys.’ British Airways, bmi, easyJet and Virgin Atlantic have also warned that ‘urgent action’ is needed to prevent chaos at airports during the Games. They said security measures, staff shortages and the sheer volume of unscheduled flights and business jets could cause severe delays for passengers during the summer. A Border Force spokesman said: ‘We are well prepared for the Olympics, with additional staff available for busy periods. ‘But we will not compromise on border security and are working with BAA to ensure we are ready to deal with extra passengers.’","MPs claim cuts to UK Border Agency staff and poor contingency plans could be a recipe for disaster .

Barack Obama last night hit out at his Republican rivals for staying silent when a GOP debate crowd booed a homosexual soldier who asked a question. During a highly combative speech to an audience of 3,000 gay rights activists, the president said: 'You want to be commander in chief? 'You can start by standing up for the men and women who wear the uniform of the United States, even when it's not politically convenient,' Recalling the boos soldiers Steven Hill received on September 22 during his videotaped question, which was filmed in Iraq, Mr Obama said: 'We don't believe in standing silent when that happens.'

To loud cheers and a standing ovation at the annual dinner of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay rights organization, he went on to say: 'We don't believe in a small America. 'We believe . in a big America - a tolerant America, a just America, an equal America . - that values the service of every patriot.' The president heralded his administration's work on gay issues, including repealing the military's ban on openly homosexual service members. But he says there is more work to be done in ensuring gay Americans are not discriminated against. He said: 'We've got more work ahead of us. But we . can also be proud of the progress we've made these past two and a half . years. Think about it. 'I need your help to fight for equality, . to pass a repeal of DOMA, to pass an inclusive employment . non-discrimination bill, so that being gay is never again a fire-able offence in America. 'And I don't have to tell you, there are . those who don't want to just stand in our way, but want to turn the . clock back, who want to return to the days when gay people couldn't . serve their country openly.

Nobody should have to produce a legal contract to hold the hand of the person that they love.' Wedding: Two U.S. military men recite their vows after the formal repeal of the military's 'don't ask, don't tell' policy . Obama also compared the fight for gay rights to the fight for civil rights and the equality of African Americans in the country. 'Two years ago, I stood at this podium, in this room, before many of you, and I made a pledge. I said I would never counsel patience; that it wasn’t right to tell you to be patient any more than it was right for others to tell African Americans to be patient in the fight for equal rights a half century ago. 'But what I also said, that while it might take time –- more time than anyone would like -– we are going to make progress, we are going to succeed, we are going to build a more perfect union.' He also referred to the recent White House summit he held to fight youth bullying and promised his administration would continue to work on it. He said: 'Together, we also have to keep sending a . message to every young person in this country who might feel alone or . afraid because they're transgender. They may be getting . picked on or pushed around because they're different. 'We've got to make . sure they know there are adults they can talk to, that they are never . alone, that there is a whole world waiting for them, filled with . possibility. 'And I want all those kids to know the president and the . first lady is standing right by them every inch of the way. I want them . to know we love them and care about them, and they're not by . themselves. That's what I want them to know.' But, as expected, Mr Obama stopped short of endorsing gay marriage, saying only that ""every single American deserves to be treated equally in the eyes of the law."" He has said his views on gay marriage are 'evolving', but for now he only supports civil union. His position on gay marriage has become a sore point for some gay activists who say they're otherwise pleased with the president's handling of issues important to them. Some of the president's backers say he could be wasting a chance to energize key segments of his base, including young people, if he doesn't publicly advocate for gay marriage. He recently announced his support of . the Respect for Marriage Act, a bill that would repeal the Defence of . Marriage Act, a 1996 law that defines marriage as between a man and a . woman. With the President increasingly focused on his 2012 campaign, some gay advocates believe Obama will wait until after the election to make any significant announcement about gay marriage. Support: Though Obama's stance on same-sex marriage is a sore point with some gay supporters who say they're otherwise pleased with the president's handling of gay issues, he received a warm welcome at the dinner . Fred Sainz, vice president of communications at the Human Rights Campaign, said he expects Obama to eventually declare his support for gay marriage. He said the President's position on this issue shouldn't diminish his work on other causes important to the gay community. They include the repeal of the military's 'don't ask, don't tell' policy and his order that the Justice Department stop defending in court a law defining marriage as between a man and a woman. 'He really has been an incredible champion for the issues that are important to us,' Mr Sainz said. 'It's fair to say we've made more progress in the past two years than we have in the past 40 years combined.' Even without Obama's backing, a few states have passed legislation legalizing gay marriage - New York was the most recent. Public sentiment is moving in the direction of supporting gay marriage, with most polls showing people are now about evenly split or narrowly in favour. Obama has recognized that reality, saying during a meeting with liberal bloggers last October that 'it's pretty clear where the trend lines are going'. Joe Sudbay of AmericaBlog.com was among the bloggers Obama spoke with last year. He said that while most gay advocates won't stop supporting the president if he doesn't speak out in favour of gay marriage before the election, doing so could give Obama's base much-needed energy. 'He might not lose votes, but he won't gain enthusiasm,' Mr Sudbay said. Editor of Americablog John Aravosis told CNN they have heard enough speeches but are now ready for action towards real change, especially in relation to gay marriage.","Obama says GOP would 'turn the clock back' in speech to gay activists .

Now Helena Bonham Carter and Dominic West are to recreate the magic between Hollywood golden couple Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton in a new BBC film. The award-winning actress and the charismatic Mr West, 43, will play the tempestuous pair when they were reunited in 1983 to star in a production of Noel Coward’s Private Lives in the US. The BBC4 film will capture the highly explosive nature of the Burton and Taylor relationship through the prism of playing star-crossed lovers on stage. Tempestuous: Elizabeth Taylor's relationship with Richard Burton is to be recreated for a BBC film . At the time everyone wanted to know whether the reunion would become a reconciliation. It was a circus that saw the pair in the centre ring and it sold tickets. Miss Bonham Carter, 46, said: ‘ Elizabeth was fifty-one , still every inch a star , still beautiful  and they still needed each other but this was professional . They were doing Noel Coward’s Private Lives on stage  playing a couple who used to be married. People wondered if they were still in love  and whether they’d be playing themselves or their characters in the play.’ At the time Burton and Taylor  were paid  $1 million each for the limited run playing  Coward’s Elyot and Amanda , a maddening  and  magnetic  couple who divorce  after enduring  a turbulent short-lived marriage. Spotlight: Helena Bonham-Carter, left, will star as Elizabeth Taylor in a one-off 90-minute drama about her tempestuous love affair with Richard Burton, who will be played by Dominic West, right . They rediscover each other years later  when each  has  a new spouse .They chuck their new partners  and run off with each other. ‘It sounds familiar  and has echoes of their own marriages and relationship’ Helena observed. Burton and Taylor fell in love on the set of  the movie Cleopatra. Both had partners  but they were eventually married in 1964  and after ten tempestuous years  of living it up they exhausted each other  and divorced  in 1974. Falling for each other: Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor on the set of 'Cleopatra' in 1963, where they began their on-off relationship . But they were soul mates and within a year they were hitched again only to break again fifteen months later in 1974. Taylor went on to marry Senator John Warner and Burton made Suzy Hunt his wife but they split  and BBC assistant producer Sally Hay subsequently became his girlfriend, and later his wife. ‘But Elizabeth and Richard  still cared for each other’, said Miss Bonham Carter. Miss Taylor unshackled herself from Warner and soon after she and Burton were together again but this time on stage in Boston trying out Private Lives before its run on Broadway. Centre stage again: Richard Burton appears to strangle Elizabeth Taylor during a scene from the Broadway revival of Noel Coward's 'Private Lives' ‘’It’s about this sliver of their lives together. They were huge stars  and  they’d never been on stage together before’, Miss Bonham Carter added. The actress won a Bafta award  for her portrait of the Queen Mother in The King’s Speech and can currently be seen in the film version of Les Miserables. She said the idea of the BBC film isn’t for her  and Mr West, who has starred in The Wire and The Hour on TV, to impersonate  Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. ‘I look nothing like her for a start but it’s about capturing the essence of them at a particular time. She was and continues to be a fascinating  woman and she was a huge star. There’s  no one comparable around now’, she said.","Helena Bonham Carter and Dominic West cast in starring roles .

On its first day in full operation, ASKAP will collect more data than is currently contained in all current radio astronomy archives or the U.S. Library of Congress. 'Radio waves tell us unique things about the cosmos, about the gas from which stars were formed, and about exotic objects, pulsars and quasars, that really push the boundaries of our knowledge of the physical laws in the universe,' Brian Boyle, the director of the project at Australia's national scientific research organization, told reporters this week.

Dead lottery winner Urooj Khan's brother now fears that the victim's teenage daughter from a previous marriage isn't going to get 'her fair share' of his $1million jackpot because Mr Khan's widow may end up with the money. Shabana Ansari is the 32-year-old widow of Mr Khan who would likely be entitled to his property because  he reportedly had no will at the time of his death. Mr Khan’s brother Imtiaz fears, however, that Mr Khan’s 17-year-old daughter Jasmeen from a prior relationship will be robbed of ‘her fair share’. Foul play: A family member called police to say Khan had not suffered a 'natural death' after he had been buried. His body will now be exhumed to inspect the contents of his last meal . Ms Ansari's attorney said Wednesday that she was subjected to a long session of questioning at a police station in November and detectives searched the family's two-story home in the West Rogers Park neighborhood on the city's North Side. Attorney Steven Kozicki said Ansari maintains she had nothing to do with the July death of her 46-year-old husband and he has no indication that detectives might be looking at her as a potential suspect. Ms Ansari’s other attorney Al-Haroon Husain, who is representing her in the probate case dealing with the lottery winnings, told The Chicago Tribune that the funds are in the process of being equitably divided between Mr Khan’s family members in keeping with Illinois law which dictates the money be split evenly between the teenage daughter and Ms Ansari. Police have not spoken publicly of any suspects or put forward a possible motive for what they now believe was an intentional poisoning. The day after receiving a check for his winnings, Khan awoke screaming in pain in his bed at his Chicago home (pictured). An expert said this is caused when muscle contract suddenly as the poison kills you 'cell by cell' Authorities initially ruled the death a result of natural causes, but when an unidentified relative came forward with suspicions they conducted a comprehensive toxicology screening that showed MR Khan was poisoned with a lethal dose of cyanide. They then reclassified the manner of death as a homicide after the mysterious phone call. Ms Ansari’s lawyers have maintained that she had absolutely no role in his death and they dismiss the financial gains as a possible motive. ‘Now in addition to grieving her husband, she's struggling to run the business that he essentially ran while he was alive,’ Mr Kozicki told The Tribune. ‘Once people analyze it, they (would) realize she's in a much worse financial position after his death than she was before.’ Fateful purchase: Khan spent $60 in June on two Illinois state lottery tickets. The second one of which proved to be a winning ticket . Habit: Khan was revealed to have spent up to $600 a day on scratchcards . Ms Ansari wouldn't talk about the mysterious circumstances of her husband's death, saying it was too painful. But she says she hopes the truth will come out in the homicide investigation. 'I was shattered. I can't believe he's no longer with me,' she said, from one of the couple's three dry cleaners. 'I don't think anyone would have a bad eye for him or that he had any enemy,' Ms Ansari said, adding that she continues to work at the dry cleaner out of a desire to honor her husband and the businesses he built. 'Work was his passion. I'm just taking care of his hard work.' According to a police report cited by the Chicago Tribune, that fateful day Mr Khan arrived at his Chicago home with his wife, Ms Ansari, and daughter, Jasmeen, and ate some dinner. Entrepreneur: Khan emigrated to the U.S. during the 1980s, and had saved enough to open three dry cleaning shops (pictured) on Chicago's Far North side . She has since recanted this story and said that she did not cook him ground beef curry that night. He then went to bed before waking up screaming as his body was 'suffocated cell by cell,' as explained by the Cook County Medical Examiner who considers this case one of the most shocking of his career. Chicago police Superintendent Garry McCarthy told reporters that he had never seen anything like Mr Khan's case in his 32 years of policing in New York, New Jersey and now Chicago.

Atlantic. He writes: . ‘It is clear that the Atlantic Star Medal that was extended to those who . served in the Arctic specified the convoys in its qualifying criteria. Those who took part in the Arctic Convoys have therefore been recognised . and received this medal as a mark of the nation’s gratitude.’ Ministry of Defence bureaucrats have repeatedly used this excuse to deny Arctic veterans their own award. But . campaigners argue that 95 per cent of the 66,500 men who served in the . Arctic Convoys had already earned the Atlantic Star before being . conscripted on to the dreaded ‘Russian Run’. Commander . Grenfell said: ‘This myth about us getting the Atlantic Star for the . Arctic is completely wrong. Most of us had been drafted to the Arctic . from service in the Home Fleet so we would have got the Atlantic Star . anyway. ‘How can they say the Atlantic and . Arctic were the same campaign? They were 800 miles apart and had . completely different aims. We’ve come up against this nonsense time and . time again. ‘I feel like we’ve been knifed in the back once again.’ Harrowing conditions: Sailors chipping away the ice and snow from the deck of H.M.S. Vansittart while on convoy duty in February 1943. Thick snow and ice covered the decks and upper works of all ships . Appalling cold: Snow and ice covered the upper works of all ships . Cdr . Grenfell, from Portsea, Hampshire, added: ‘The convoy campaign, which . helped keep Russia in the war, was the only major sea campaign of the . Second World War not to be honoured by a medal. ‘The Africa Star was awarded to all those who spent one day in the sunny Mediterranean, whether in action or not. ‘Cameron . said in the summer, “When you make a promise to the leaders of the . Third World [about aid] there is a moral case for honouring it”. Are . Arctic war veterans not just as important?’ The Ministry of Defence has claimed a . new Arctic medal would cost the taxpayer £14million. But medal experts . believe the actual cost would be £600,000. Hero: In perilous conditions a sailor frees chains, wires and bollards from the ice . There are now just 200 Arctic convoy veterans alive. Many want a medal as their ‘dying wish’.Prince . Michael of Kent, a Honorary Rear Admiral of the Royal Naval Reserve, . said: ‘The suffering they had to go through was absolutely indescribable . but they have kept their heads and kept themselves together.’ He said this year – the 70th anniversary of the first convoy – was the ‘right moment’ to award a medal. In 2006, the Labour government said Arctic Convoy veterans could wear a small lapel badge – but refused to strike a medal. But . it was deeply unpopular with veterans who claimed it belittled their . sacrifice. Only 10,000 out of a potential 66,000 badges were applied . for. The campaign for . an Arctic medal has been backed by 47 MPs from all parties who have . signed a Parliamentary petition to put pressure on Downing Street. Unsung: One of 78 convoys that braved frozen seas to help win the war . Angus Robertson, the Scottish National Party leader at Westminster who tabled the motion, said: ‘Promises have been made to the Arctic Convoy veterans for a specific medal to recognise their heroism. ‘It is totally unacceptable to treat these brave veterans so shabbily by going back on those promises. The UK government must deliver. ‘The surviving veterans are now in their 80s and 90s. The question of whether an Arctic medal should be created should be dealt with quickly so that as many of them as possible can receive the medal they deserve.’ Tory MP Caroline Dinenage, who represents the coastal  town of Gosport in Hampshire, has said: ‘The selfless acts of bravery seen during the Arctic Campaign were nothing short  of inspirational. ‘Surely these acts of great heroism warrant the award of a medal in its own right.’The Coalition Government ordered the Ministry of Defence to review the medals system in July 2010. Downing Street attempted yesterday to play down Mr Cameron’s apparent U-turn. A spokesman said: ‘The Prime Minister has been clear that all World War Two veterans deserve the recognition they rightly deserve. In the letter, the Prime Minister was recognising, as a matter of fact, what had already been awarded. The Prime Minister is very clear on not pre-judging the review’s outcome.’ Bravery: Eric Alley made 15 convoy journeys between August 1941 and March 1943 . By IAN DRURY . Battered by waves as high as houses, the ships sailed on through the darkness, fog and appalling cold of the Arctic winter. But the weather was as nothing compared with the fear of being attacked by German warplanes, battleships and U-boats. A total of 78 convoys delivered four million tons of vital cargo and munitions to the Soviet Union – allowing the Red Army to repel the Nazi invasion. The cost in lives was horrific. More than 3,000 UK seamen were killed in the treacherous waters of the Arctic Ocean as they undertook the terrifying trips to keep Russia supplied and fighting on the Eastern Front. In total, 85 merchant and 16 Royal Navy vessels perished between 1941 and 1945. But the cost had the Arctic convoys not succeeded would have been worse: Nazi Germany would very probably have won the Second World War. Churchill proposed the convoys following Operation Barbarossa, Germany’s invasion of Russia. Cabinet documents reveal that Britain’s greatest prime minister promised to supply Stalin ‘at all costs’. He knew that if Russia fell, the full weight of the Nazi military machine would be targeted at the West. Over four years, the convoys delivered 7,000 warplanes, 5,000 tanks and other battlefield vehicles, ammunition, fuel, food, medicine and further emergency supplies. Because Norway and the Baltic states had been captured by Germany, the only way to get the goods to Russia was through the northern ports of Murmansk and Archangel, both inside the Arctic Circle. The first convoys set off from Iceland and Loch Ewe in the Scottish Highlands. Two or three reached their destination unscathed. But then the Germans ‘got wise’ to the missions, said Eric Alley, 88, who served as a radar operator on HMS Inglefield. ‘After they woke up, all hell broke loose. They shifted all their most able Luftwaffe squadrons and U-boats to Norway and we’d be under constant attack from the air and sea,’ said Mr Alley, from Weymouth, Dorset. ‘You’d hear a horrible bang and one of the ships would disappear. Once I was moving across the deck and there was a huge explosion. I saw a column of smoke and fire and one of the ships start to sink. The poor blighters on board didn’t stand a chance. We heard ships call for help but couldn’t do anything about it.’ Mr Alley, who made 15 convoy journeys between August 1941 and March 1943, said conditions on board were ‘pretty terrible’. He learned the hard way about the freezing temperatures when the skin on his hand was ripped off as he accidentally grabbed a ladder. The final convoy departed from the Clyde on May 12, 1945, and arrived at Kola Inlet, near Murmansk, on May 20. It sailed back into Glasgow ten days later. Victory in Europe had been declared on May 8 – not least thanks to the sacrifice of the heroes of the Arctic convoys.","David Cameron 'reneges' on pledge to introduce a specific Arctic Medal .

"By . Harriet Arkell . PUBLISHED: . 14:31 EST, 21 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:18 EST, 21 January 2013 . Control pad demon: Prince Harry unwinds at Camp Bastion . Sitting exams at school was 'a nightmare' for Prince Harry, but like many of his age the third in line to the throne is a whiz at computer games on the PlayStation and Xbox. Harry, who was educated at Ludgrove Prep School and Eton College, said he was 'absolutely useless' at written tests at school, but is making up for it now by beating his army colleagues at computer games. He said: 'You can ask the guys: I thrash them at Fifa the whole time.' In an interview conducted before he flew home to the UK from his deployment as an Apache helicopter co-pilot gunner (CPG), the 28-year-old revealed how he and his friends in 662 Squadron based in Camp Bastion played computer games and ate pizza when they had time off. He also talked about his living conditions at the dusty army base, and revealed he was sent a jar of Clarence House honey made by bees at the Prince of Wales' official residence. The young royal also said his father had sent him a box of Cuban cigars, some of which he traded with American soldiers in exchange for their treats from home. Showing appealing modesty about his obvious skills as a pilot, the Prince said his skills at sports and games helped pave the way for him to become a top pilot. He said: 'Exams were always a nightmare, but anything like kicking a ball around or playing PlayStation - or flying - I do generally find a little bit easier than walking, sometimes. 'It's a joy for me because I'm one of those people who loves playing PlayStation and Xbox, so with my thumbs I like to think that I'm probably quite useful.' The Prince said taking the controls in the helicopter came naturally to him, and he qualified top of his class as a CPG despite finding the academic side tricky. 'Thrashing the guys at Fifa': Prince Harry plays computer games with his fellow Apache crew members . Downtime in Helmand Province: The young royal enjoys films and computer games with his friends . He said: 'I'm one of those people that, during my flying course especially, I would be fine at flying. 'And . then every now and then a written test would come up and I'd be . absolutely useless, and I've been like that from stage one of my youth.' Harry . had to repeat his last year at Ludgrove to get into Eton in 1998 and . his GCSE results were never made public, but it was while he was at Eton . that he began to show his military potential in the cadets. After a gap year, the young Prince went to Sandhurst, despite not going to university, and was then picked for Apache co-pilot gunner course. He said: 'Being a junior captain, or a lieutenant then that I was and a non-grad [non-graduate], obviously not going to university, therefore the army presume you to be less intelligent, which is nice of them - probably true. 'But there were a couple of us that got pushed forward to the front seat instead of the back seat.' After his 18 months of helicopter training in both the UK and US, the Prince won a prize as the best CPG out of his class of more than 20. Playing it down, he said: 'The only reason I won the award is because I was the only one who didn't slip up at some point. 'Weird reality': Prince Harry complained about being 'stuck' in Camp Bastion, but enjoyed flying the Apaches . Long way from St James's Palace: The Prince made good friends with his crew members and was treated like any other soldier . 'They had to give the award to someone. I was one of the few left standing, so that's the only reason I got that award.' But his commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Tom de le Rue, said he won the prize on merit. 'That was absolutely the right decision that was made, and he has been performing superbly out here. 'He really is on top of his game. He's an excellent co-pilot gunner and I think he's very much enjoying being able to deliver support'. Captain Simon Beattie, the other CPG on Harry's flight of two Apaches, said the Prince was reliable and sharp in the cockpit. He said: 'It's nice to have someone who you know you can rely on as well in the other aircraft. 'He's quick. He keeps me on my toes to make sure I stay ahead of the game as well.' Prince Harry out of his uniform at Camp Bastion and, right, in festive spirit for an Afghan Christmas Day . Harry won the respect of his military colleagues at Camp Bastion for his ability to muck in with them without any special treatment. As one of thousands of troops stationed in the isolated base in the Afghan desert, the Prince slept in a converted shipping container, sharing a room and eating and washing with everyone else. The soldiers can get a fresh coffee or an alcohol-free beer at the Heroes Bar, pick up Afghan souvenirs at one of the local shops, and even get a takeaway at the Pizza Hut restaurant, also based in a former shipping container. They go to the canteen for cooked breakfast, lunch and dinner, take their laundry or 'dhobi' to the laundrette, and can work out at a number of indoor or outdoor gyms. The Prince said: 'Obviously lots of guys like the luxury and comforts of Bastion, but what's weird is we're stuck in Bastion and what's going on out there is completely separate.' His closest friends in his unit - nicknamed 662 'Royal' Squadron by the other 3 Regiment Army Air Corps (AAC) soldiers - were the other crew members on his flight of two aircraft. As part of a four-man Apache crew, Prince Harry had to be ready to sprint to his helicopter . 'Luxury at its best': Prince Harry joked about his sleeping area, where an old ammunition box was a table . Harry's four-man flight would usually work three consecutive overnight duties before moving on to other shifts on the aircrew rota. While waiting for call-out, they would be in the VHR (very high readiness) tent, where they would play the military board game Uckers, watch films, play computer games and chat. Off-duty, he would sleep in temporary sleeping quarters that he jokingly described as 'Luxury at is best, I guess'. The third in line to the throne slept under a coverless duvet, with pillows and a black sleeping bag on a burgundy sprung mattress. He said: 'It's flat, it's got springs, but it's better than a cot-bed, which is what all the other guys are sleeping in, when you can't really roll left to right and you're stuck in a V.' He had an empty ammunition box as a beside table, home to his alarm clock and earplugs, and plain walls with a couple of rugs on the ground. The Apache helicopter co-piloted by HRH Prince Harry just before lift-off on a night mission from Camp Bastion in Afghanistan . Night-time mission: Once the call comes, Harry and his crew members have to race to their Apache and scramble out over Helmand . In the VHR tent, the soldiers had a well-stocked kitchen with fridge, toaster, microwave, and snacks including chocolate bars and jars of Marmite. 'A free minibar would be great', Harry joked. The soldiers played computer games such as Fifa 13 with a fierce competitiveness, and agreed that their royal colleague was second in the rankings. They also watched endless films on their 32-inch colour television, with piles of DVDs ranging from Apocalypse Now and Gladiator to the Hangover and Borat. The Prince said: 'We've probably got every DVD, every film known to mankind, and we've probably watched all of them.' In the run-up to Christmas, Harry put on a Father Christmas hat complete with pigtails. Prince Harry walks towards the VHR (very high readiness) tent to start his 12-hour shift at the British-controlled flight-line in Camp Bastion in southern Afghanistan . He said: 'We watched a repeat of the Royal Variety Performance, which was quite entertaining.' 'When we started we'd be called out once, maybe twice at the most, but now it's cold it's fairly quiet.  Less stuff happens at night.' The Prince would get up early when it was his turn to make a cafetiere of coffee for his crew members, and joked he was so tired that he was still asleep. Capt Beattie said: 'It's easy to put aside the fact that he's third-in-line to the throne.  He's a normal guy.' He said he didn't think twice before teasing the Prince, because 'He's pretty forward on the banter as well - it's just part of us all being together.' The Prince's squadron commander, Major Ali Mack, said: 'I think he enjoys the relative anonymity of being in theatre where he is allowed to get on with his daily business relatively unmolested and as a squadron we are very much one big family.' Prince Harry, who previously served on the ground coordinating air strikes on the Taliban during his 2007-2008 tour in Afghanistan, says he missed being on the ground. Standing in front of his £45m Apache helicopter, he said: 'It's a pain in the a*** being stuck in Bastion; going to the cookhouse with hundreds of people - it's frustrating. 'But then again, I get to fly this thing, so it comes with pros and cons.'","Old Etonian soldier says he was 'useless at exams' but wins on the Xbox .

"By . Paul Revoir . PUBLISHED: . 18:01 EST, 21 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 01:41 EST, 22 October 2012 . The BBC’s director-general was under intense pressure last night as he prepared to face MPs with the revelations from tonight’s devastating Panorama documentary into the Savile scandal ringing in his ears. Recently-appointed chief George Entwistle is understood to have taken legal advice ahead of answering questions from the Culture Select Committee tomorrow. Mr Entwistle, who was director of BBC Vision in 2011, will be asked why he did nothing last December when he was informed by director of news Helen Boaden that an impending Newsnight investigation into Savile might mean he would have to change his Christmas broadcast schedule, which contained a tribute to the late television personality. Probe: The new Director General George Entwistle is facing a grilling over the BBC handling of the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal . Mr Entwistle was appointed director-general earlier this year, succeeding Mark Thompson. A popular figure and former editor of Newsnight, he vowed to put ‘quality’ back at  the heart of the BBC. But his critics argue that he has simply failed to grasp the enormity of the unfolding Savile scandal on three separate occasions. The first was when he was briefed by Miss Boaden in December 2011; the second was when the decision to shelve the Savile film was publicised in January this year; and the third and final occasion was when the full horror of Savile’s crimes became clear at the start of this month. Silent: Helen Boaden was aware of the outline of the shelved Newsnight investigation but has made no comment since the scandal erupted . MPs will grill him about how he responded . to the scandal after it emerged that ITV planned to run its own . programme dealing with the Savile claims. Panorama claims that Mr Entwistle was . misleading in his accounts of exactly why the Savile film  was pulled . from the Newsnight schedules last year. Mr . Entwistle has  said publicly that the reason it was shelved was because . the original programme was not an investigation purely into Savile’s . abuse, but into a failed previous inquiry into Savile by Surrey police. In an email to staff on October 5, Mr Entwistle suggested as much by saying: ‘The BBC Newsnight programme investigated Surrey police’s inquiry into Jimmy Savile towards the end of 2011.’ Similarly, the line consistently given . by the BBC has been that the reason the programme was dropped was . because of a ‘lack of evidence’ to  confirm the specific allegation that Surrey police and the Crown Prosecution Service had scrapped the . investigation because of Savile’s age and health. Contradiction: Newsnight producer Meirion Jones gave a different account about the Savile report was spiked . But . two Newsnight staff members who worked on the investigation have now . told Panorama that this  suggested the programme was about the police . inquiry and not about Savile’s misdeeds. Indeed, within hours of Mr Entwistle’s October 5 email, producer Meirion Jones had responded to contradict his account. He . wrote: ‘George – one note – the investigation was into whether Jimmy . Savile was a paedophile – I know because it was my investigation. ‘We . didn’t know that Surrey police had investigated Jimmy Savile –  no one . did – that was what we found when we investigated and interviewed his . victims.’ And the reporter who worked with Mr Jones, Liz MacKean, tells Panorama: ‘The story we were investigating was very clear cut. ‘It . was about Jimmy Savile being a paedophile and using his status as a . charity fundraiser and television presenter to get access to places . where there were vulnerable teenage girls he could abuse.’ Tonight’s . film will also increase the pressure on Miss Boaden, who was aware of . the outline of the Newsnight investigation but has made no comment since . the scandal erupted. More than 200 people have come forward to say they were abused by the TV star . Panorama reveals that she had a ‘conversation of less than ten seconds’ with Mr Entwistle about the film at an awards ceremony at a Hilton Hotel . in London on December 2 last year, telling him about the risk to a . Christmas television schedule which contained a tribute to Savile. In addition, Newsnight editor Peter Rippon, who dramatically quit last night over the affair, has always maintained that he was not put under any pressure to shelve the story. But the documentary will hear bombshell . claims from Miss  MacKean that Mr Rippon was feeling under pressure from . his bosses to drop the investigation in November last year. Questions: Director general George Entwistle, left, faces a panel of MPs over the corporation's handling of the scandal which caused Newsnight editor Peter Rippon, right, to step down from his role . Panorama reveals that on November 30, 2011 – after a string of rows with Mr Rippon – Miss MacKean wrote to a friend: ‘PR [Peter Rippon] says if the bosses aren’t happy...[he] can’t go to the wall on this one.’ The Newsnight journalists also take issue with another public statement made by their editor. In defending his decision to drop the story, on October 2, 2012, Mr Rippon wrote in his BBC blog: ‘We are confident that all the women we spoke to had contacted the police already.’ But Mr Jones tells Panorama: ‘The key witness Karin Ward categorically told us she had not gone to the police and Peter was reminded many times that this was the case both verbally and in writing.’","Explosive Panorama report claims Director-general George Entwistle gave misleading accounts about why Savile expose was pulled .

The world’s largest telescope is due to be completed in March and can already capture far more than one of the first ones invented by Galileo Galilei that saw sunspots and valleys on the surface of the moon. The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile’s Atacama desert reaches farther . beyond Earth's skies than any other radio telescope and has already . captured incredible images different from anything seen before by . visible-light and infrared telescopes. Remote: The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile's Atacama desert is one of the world's largest astronomy projects . When finished, it will be up to ten times sharper than NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope. Even now, ALMA can already show the detailed . structures of clouds of cold gases and debris that only look like ink . stains with other telescopes. David Rabanus, ALMA’s instrument group manager, said: ‘What surprises me is what is being observed. Until now, we haven't had such a capable observatory. ‘We've never been able to observe with such resolution, such accuracy.’ Many parts make up a whole: When completed, 66 radio antennae will combine as a single giant telescope pointing skyward. So far, 43 have been set up . Cosmic: The telescope captured this incredible image of a pair of distorted colliding spiral galaxies about 70 million light-years away, in the constellation of Corvus (The Crow) ALMA has even been able to detect sugar molecules in the gas surrounding a star about 400 light years away. It is the telescope’s location in one of the harshest places on earth that makes this possible. The 16,400-foot (5,000-metre) altitude, thin air and mercurial climate in the Atacama desert can be unbearable. Visitors must breathe oxygen from a tank just to keep from fainting while winds reach 62 mph (100 km) and temperatures drop to 10 below zero (minus 25 degrees Celsius). The telescope has also revealed a never before seen unexpected spiral structure in the material around an old star . Close up: The radio antennas pick up wavelengths of light longer than anything visible to the human eye . For astronomers, however, the lack of humidity, low interference from other radio signals and closeness to the upper atmosphere combine to make this the perfect spot for the telescope. Jointly funded and managed by the United States, Canada, the European Union, Japan and Taiwan, the $1.5 billion project is an engineering triumph that launches Chile, already home to some of the world's largest optical telescopes, to the forefront of ground-based space exploration. Jose Maza, a University of Chile astronomy professor said: ‘We're talking about the United Nations of astronomy joined for a billion dollar adventure. ‘Scientists are like kids playing with very expensive toys and these ones are technological developments that could change the world.’ The telescope will consist of 66 radio antennae, 43 of which have already been set up as a single giant telescope pointing skyward. Inhospitable: The telescope is being built in Chile's Atacama desert at an altitude of 16,400-feet. Temperatures plummet at night and winds reach 62mph . When finished, the telescope will be up to ten times sharper than NASA's Hubble Space Telescope . Test run: A transporter truck lifts a box that weighs as much as an antenna, as part of a transport test. The trucks travel 22 miles over five hours to reach the plateau . ALMA's parts are shipped from all over the world and assembled at a warehouse 9,514 feet (2,900 meters) above sea level. The dishes are hauled up to their final destination by two custom-made 28-wheel transporters that travel 22 miles over five hours to reach the plateau. Each antenna is perched on a rotating steel pedestal with precisely installed copper lining to protect from lightning. The structures, 40 feet (12-meter) tall, lean closer together or farther apart as astronomers zoom in or get wider views.

A second man has been arrested in north London on suspicion of raping an 11-year-old girl who was attacked in a park on her way home from school. The man, aged 18, was arrested in Edmonton and is being held in custody at a nearby police station following the two hour assault in nearby Enfield, which left the girl needing surgery. His arrest follows that of a 26-year-old man who was detained yesterday but later released on bail pending further investigation. Scene of the attack: A police car patrols outside Jubilee Park in Enfield, where an 11-year-old girl was subjected to a 'brutal' sexual assault on Friday evening . Police are continuing to appeal for witnesses to the attack. The girl was raped as she walked home along a busy shortcut after getting off a bus on Friday afternoon. She realised she was being followed and tried to zig-zag across the . road, but the attacker grabbed her and pulled her into Jubilee Park, . where the assault took place. The victim finally got home around 8pm and told her distressed parents what had happened and they took her to hospital. The park lies opposite a row of smart houses in the affluent north London suburb. Police are still appealing for witnesses, with up to 60 officers working on the investigation. Detective Inspector Simon Ellershaw, who is leading the investigation for the Sapphire Command, said: 'It’s a brutal attack on a defenceless 11-year-old girl. It doesn’t need me to say how serious an attack this is. 'This was a horrific and unusual attack of a defenceless school girl making her way home via her usual route, along one of Enfield’s busiest shortcuts, at the beginning of Friday afternoon rush-hour. 'She says the attack happened for some considerable time - possibly in the region of two to three hours. Violence: This section of the park was closed off as police searched for clues following the attack shortly after 4.15pm on Friday . 'I am appealing to motorists, pedestrians and any one who may have been using the park between 16.45hrs-20.00hrs, who may have seen a man following a girl in school uniform, to contact us. 'An extensive search of the park is underway and local officers are conducting house-to-house enquiries, and we have already been receiving helpful information from members of the public. 'Given the significant and unaccounted amount of time between the incident and the victim’s arrival home, we are particularly keen to speak to anyone who may have seen her possibly appearing confused or dishevelled following her ordeal. 'All calls will be treated in the utmost confidence.' He said the girl was being supported by her family and they are hoping she will make a full recovery.

'The investigation is being run by a specialised unit from Edmonton Police Station. 'They are working hard identify the suspect and offer dedicated support to the victim and her family.' A spokesman for Enfield council said that the park gates were locked at 4.50pm on Friday, meaning the pair may have been locked in the park together. He said: 'While the thoughts of the entire council are with the victim of this horrific crime and her family, it is worth bearing in mind that parks by their very nature are designed to be accessible and it is extremely difficult to prevent access to people determined to break into them. 'We take all crime extremely seriously and our parks police work closely with friends of parks groups and park users to deal with any concerns raised in relation to safety in our parks. 'We will be co-operating fully with the police in an effort to bring the perpetrator of this horrific crime to justice and would urge anyone with information to ring the police.'

"At least 200 elephants in Bouba N'Djida reserve killed since January . 20 fresh carcasses found last week . Demand from China driving ivory black market . By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 08:49 EST, 16 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:51 EST, 16 March 2012 . These heartbreaking photos show the extent of an elephant slaughter in the troubled nation of Cameroon. At least half the elephant population in Bouba N'Djida reserve have been slaughtered because the west African nation sent too few security forces to tackle poachers, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) said on Thursday. In what was described as one of the worst poaching massacres in decades, and at least 200 elephants have been killed for their tusks since January by poachers on horseback from Chad and Sudan. According to The International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), poachers slaughtered 300-400 elephants for their tusks in Cameroon since 2012, up to 200 in a single park. Here is just one of the dead . 'WWF is disturbed by reports that the poaching continues unabated,' Natasha Kofoworola Quist, WWF's representative in the region, said in a statement. About 20 fresh elephant carcasses were discovered last week, a spokesperson for the organisation said from Cameroon. The government of the Central African state has sent special forces to track the poachers and end the killing spree in the north of the country, but the WWF said this may be too little, too late. 'The forces arrived too late to save most of the park's elephants and were too few to deter the poachers,' Quist said. She said the organisation regretted that a soldier was killed during a clash with the poachers. Security has been unable to prevent the massacre carried out by poachers on horseback from Sudan and Chad . WWF said at least half the population of Bouba N'Djida's elephants have been killed. The International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) said cross-border poaching was common during the dry season but the scale of the killings this year was unprecedented. 'They move 1,000 kilometers (more than 600 miles) on horseback to get to northern Cameroon because they have already wiped out the elephants of Chad and Central African Republic,' said Richard Carroll, vice president of the U.S. chapter of WWF. According to IFAW, poachers slaughtered as many as 400 elephants for their tusks in Cameroon since the killing spree began. IFAW said it was not clear how many elephants remained in Cameroon but a 2007 estimate put the figure at between 1,000 and 5,000. Growing demand for ivory in China is 'the leading driver behind the illegal trade in ivory today' according to an expert, and most of the ivory is smuggled to Thailand and China . The government had sent up to 150 soldiers into the national park on March 1 - taking action after weeks of pressure from the fund and from the European Union. Wildlife activists blame China's growing footprint in Africa for an unprecedented surge in poaching elephants for their tusks. Most are believed to be smuggled to China and Thailand to make ivory ornaments. Growing demand for ivory in China is 'the leading driver behind the illegal trade in ivory today,' said Tom Milliken, an elephant and rhino expert for the wildlife trade monitoring network TRAFFIC. China has a legal ivory market that is supposed to be highly controlled but tons and tons of illegal ivory has made its way there in recent years, said the Zimbabwe-based Milliken, who spoke in a conference call with several World Wildlife Fund officers.","At least 200 elephants in Bouba N'Djida reserve killed since January .

One of the world's most famous department stores today won a legal fight with fur trade protesters after complaining that families were 'harassed' when pop star Lady Gaga visited to advertise perfume. A High Court judge tightened restrictions on protests outside Harrods in Knightsbridge, London, after being told that demonstrators had caused a 'nuisance' during Lady Gaga's appearance in October 2012. Mr Justice Globe concluded that existing restrictions on protests did not provide 'sufficient protection'. The judge issued a written ruling after a High Court hearing in London in May. Protest: Lady Gaga arriving for a signing session of her fragrance 'Fame' at Harrods in Knightsbridge, central London, in October last year . Harrods' bosses had complained about . the behaviour of protesters during Lady Gaga's visit on October 7. Mr . Justice Globe said the star had visited the store to 'advertise some . perfumery'. 'It is Harrods' case that the .

'From statements, photographs and CCTV . evidence, I have a very clear understanding of the nature of the event . and what happened on this occasion.' He said Harrods had also complained about protesters' behaviour on Boxing Day 2012 - the first day of the store's winter sale. The judge said anti-fur trade . campaigners began demonstrations outside Harrods in 2005.

'Harrods have started to utilise to greater advantage the fully completed development of Hans Crescent,' said the judge. 'The existing order did not take into account its fully-completed state and its potential.' He added: 'It has become a tourist hotspot likened to the area around Covent Garden. In conjunction with the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, the store is now organising more substantial events in the Hans Crescent area, which are drawing larger crowds to see what effectively is a show.' Mr Justice Globe, who said Lady Gaga arrived in Hans Crescent before going into Harrods, concluded that there had been a 'change of circumstances'. 'I am not satisfied that the existing order provides sufficient protection for the rights of the claimants, customers and the public to enjoy the facilities and events in the crescent,' said the judge.

"By . Leon Watson . UPDATED: . 09:21 EST, 25 October 2011 . The audience will be expectant, and so will the performer. These are the first pictures of the brightly-coloured Brooklyn art gallery that's been converted into a bedroom - so an artist can give birth. Marni Kotak has created a cosy environment for the birth of her first child. It is brightly decorated with ocean blue walls, family pictures and photo-imprinted pillows and blankets of the mother-to-be. Everyday: Brooklyn-based performance artist Marni Kotak, who plans to give birth to her first child in front of a public audience . In the centre is an inflatable birthing . pool and air mattress for the midwife and doula lie near the bed. A . soundtrack of the ocean plays nonstop. Marni, 36, is a performance artist who has created a home-birth centre at the Microscope Gallery where she plans to deliver her baby as a work of art sometime in the next few weeks. The gallery has extended the days it is open to all seven days a week so Marni — as part of the project — can develop a rapport with members of the public who come to see 'The Birth of Baby X.' She and her painter-husband, Jason Bell, don't know the baby's gender and have not picked out a name. About 20 people a day stop by to talk to Marni or see the free exhibit, which opened on October 8. Visitors can leave contact information if they want to return for the birth. Marni said her audience 'won't be total strangers.' She said those who spend time talking to her about motherhood, birth and art and learning about the project will be notified when she goes into labor. If she's home at the time, she will go to the gallery. 'I'm developing an authentic relationship with these people,' she said. 'For me, it's like building a community of people who are really interested in this.' All set: Marni with her painter-artist husband Jason Robert Bell . About 15 people, mostly those on the list plus the birthing team, are expected to witness the birth — the most the room can comfortably hold. She doesn't plan to talk to her audience. 'However, I never know how a performance will progress and sometimes unexpected things happen,' she said. Marni's husband will document everything. No other cameras or video will be allowed. Should there be an emergency, a hospital is less than half a mile away. Marni, whose childhood was spent in Norwood, Massachusetts, said all her performances focus on everyday life experiences. She has been re-enacting events from her life for more than 10 years, including her own birth, losing her virginity in 'a sunny blue Plymouth' and her grandfather's funeral. Jill McDermid, a curator and co-director of the performance art Grace Exhibition Space in Brooklyn, called Marni's work 'daring, challenging and honest.' She said people shouldn't be shocked. 'The audience is very limited. Marni views them as people she can trust, who are interested in her work and in her,' Ms McDermid said. Expectant: Marni's performance will be at the Microscope Gallery in Bushwick, Brooklyn . Marni laughs as her artist-painter husband Jason Bell, plays with a rubber ball that is part of the birthing room . In combining the birth of her child with artistic expression, Marni said she wants to show 'this amazing life performance that... is essentially hidden from public view' and that addresses social taboos regarding the human body. Besides giving birth before an audience, she expects she will shower behind a clear plastic curtain during her labor and she plans to breastfeed her baby. 'She's in the tradition of using your life as your authentic material and shaping and forming it' — a tradition that goes back to 1959 when filmmaker Stan Brakhage recorded the birth of his first child as a work of art, said feminist artist Carolee Schneemann, whose own works deal with taboo themes of sexuality. 'She's vulnerable, she's exposed,' she said of Marni. 'It's the most basic visceral experience that also has the most taboos.' The entire gallery is given over to the installation, and Marni spends as much time there as she can. She carved out space for a tiny kitchenette and the portable shower with curtain pockets filled with photos from her three baby showers. And when she's not there, sitting on the bed or rocker, visitors have plenty of things to see in the small studio-sized space: A photo wallpaper border of Marni pregnant in a bikini on the beach; videos featuring some of her other performance art; a video projection over the bed of Marni and her husband on a beach; and a video from their Caribbean honeymoon shot through camera-equipped spyglasses. Ready: The gallery has been converted into a birthing room for Marni . The intimate space holds a double bed, originally Marni's grandmother's, then hers and later used to conceive Baby X. A wall display holds her pregnancy test and silver baby spoon and an altar displays the framed image of her ultrasound. Two 10ft high trophies tower near the bed — one for Marni for giving birth, the other for Baby X for being born. Amy-Clare McCarthy, 23, hopes to attend the birth. She missed the artist on a recent visit to the gallery but was impressed by the exhibit. All the components 'build up to that final event,' she said. 'I think it's really interesting to frame the birth as a performance piece,' said McCarthy, of Brisbane, Australia, who is doing a museum internship at MoMA PS. 1 in Queens. 'I'm interested in the blurring of art, of what makes art and what's life and how they're converging in the gallery space.' Henry Glucroft, co-owner of Little Skips Café next door to the gallery in Bushwick, said he found the exhibit 'interesting, crazy and intriguing.' 'I think the art project pushes people to question society's approach of giving birth, what our preconceptions are,' said Mr Glucroft. He declined to say whether he planned to attend the birth. Marni said she and her husband will share the details of the birth to their child 'over time as an organic process.' 'The overall message that we will communicate to the child is that he or she was born in an art gallery because, as artists, that is our sacred space, and in doing this we are telling the world and our child that his or her life is a precious work of art.' The exhibition runs until November 7.","Family pictures and personal decorations adorn Brooklyn gallery .

The nostalgic snaps are a world away from today's 'cotton wool' generation who are cosseted by parents and coddled by safety concerns . It’s enough to give the average health and safety officer a seizure. But this is the sort of fun that scouts used to get up to in the days when a spirit of adventure was unfettered by red tape. The photographs, taken between the 1930s and 1950s, were unearthed to mark the  centenary celebrations of a scout group in Altrincham, Cheshire, and are a world  away from today’s ‘cotton wool’ generation who are cosseted by parents and coddled by safety concerns. There was nothing to hold back the 3rd Altrincham Scouts group, based at Altrincham Grammar School for Boys, when it was founded 100 years ago today. A young scout dangles from an improvised rope bridge, which looks a lot like a plank attached to some lengths of rope . A young man with a pretend leg injury is hauled up a school building in a makeshift splint. While it certainly looks fun, it probably would not pass current health and safety legislation . Assistant district commissioner George Sharp, 73, who has been involved with the group for 60 years, admitted times had changed but insisted Scouting today remained just as fun as in 1913. ‘The leaders of old had fewer restrictions imposed on them with health and safety,’ he said. ‘We’ve learned to manage the risks, but it’s fair to say we are more safety-conscious than we used to be. However, that doesn’t stop us offering adventurous activities.’ He said today’s children often needed encouragement to enjoy the delights of outdoor life and camping. Geoffrey William Sutcliffe who documented the scout troop in photographs. Known as Little Squirrel, he died in 2004 . ‘Youngsters these days tend to have less patience than we did and it is a bit of a culture shock for some to be introduced to a tea towel when they have never known life without a dishwasher, but they soon get into the swing of things.’ A Scout Association spokesman said the shot of the boy being rescued was not necessarily relegated to the past. He added: ‘These casualty rescue skills are still practised today, if not necessarily from the side of a building.’","Snaps taken between 1930s and 1950s, show how much fun scouts had .

Mauro Lagiard, 72, was attacked from behind as he entered the enclosure at a closed-down zoo, near Turin, in northern Italy. In a horrific scene he was dragged 100ft while his wife watched helplessly from outside the cage. Dismembered: An Italian policeman (right) inspects the scene next to the body of Mauro Lagiard (bottom left) His dismembered body was later found by the tigers' water trough, police said. Mr Lagiard and his wife had cared for the tigers since the small animal sanctuary was closed down in 2010 at the peak of the economic crisis. The couple lived on site near the tigers’ enclosure in a camper van. The retired zoo keeper was ‘utterly fearless’ and devoted to the animals according to reports in the Italian media. On Tuesday night, he went in to the cage to feed them chicken meatballs. But this time the alpha-male, named Samir, went in for the kill quickly followed by two others in the pack. Five recently born cubs watched hungrily from the sidelines. The elderly keeper was dragged through the dirt to a clearing and torn to pieces. After hearing desperate screams his wife Carla called for medics. Tigers rest in their enclosure at the private park in Pinerolo, Turin, where Mauro Lagiard was attacked . But the 73-year-old, who walked with the help of two sticks, was powerless to come to her husband's aid and could only watch in agony from outside the cage. Even after the ambulance arrived it was half an hour before the medics could get close to him. The tiger that attacked first was the one he loved the most, according to reports, even though the same animal had attacked him before two years ago causing him to spend eight months in hospital. At the time the faithful owner blamed himself, saying he was wearing aftershave which had confused the animal. It was a miracle’ that he had survived, he said. Even yesterday Mrs Lagiard still refused to blame the tigers, telling reporters: ‘My husband and Samir did not get on. If I had gone it would never have happened.’ But neighbours said the animals were malnourished and aggressive. They were fed just twice a week. The couple had always been big cat lovers and originally kept both tigers and leopards at a villa outside Turin where they had a big garden. After problems with neighbours they were evicted and the cats were almost put down. But at the last minute the owner of an animal sanctuary called the Martinat Oasis came to their rescue offering them space at his park. The tourists would be able to see the tigers but the couple had to take care of their maintenance themselves, he said. George Martinat said that he had taken them in because he had sympathised with their plight. He told Italian newspaper la Stampa: ’They said that the animals were their lives. ‘Even though they were elderly and physically debilitated, I did not want to be responsible for separating them from their animals.’ A keeper who had worked at the animal sanctuary said Mr Lagiard was ‘very sure of himself.’ He told the newspaper la Repubblica: ‘He never took any precautions. He went in, he gave them their food and he left. He had no fear, even though in the past he had been attacked by the same tigers.’ Then in 2010 mounting bills and dwindling numbers of visitors forced the closure of the zoo. New homes were found for the animals. The only ones to stay were the tigers, as well as one old leopard, now 24 years old. Mauro Lagiard was attacked as he entered the enclosure at a closed-down zoo, near Turin, in northern Italy . The couple had continued to care for them with love and a few families continued to trickle up the hill to see the big cats. But local residents and animal activists were concerned by the keepers’ advancing age and the aggressive nature of the tigers, who appeared skinny and malnourished. After the first attack on Mr Lagiard two years ago many believed the animals were dangerous. A few months ago five tiger cubs were born bringing the total number of tigers to feed to ten. Finally, last week Mr Lagiard was asked to meet the mayor but the council was struggling to find a suitable home for the animals. They are currently in the care of vets while their fate is decided. Samir is likely to be put down, according to reports.","Mauro Lagiard was attacked in his closed-down zoo near Turin in Italy .

David Cameron today demanded assurances from China over the investigation into the death of Neil Heywood as pictures emerged of the hotel where the British businessman met his murky end. Mr Heywood, 41, was found dead in mysterious circumstances at the Nanshan Lijing Holiday Hotel in Chongqing last November. It is one of the city's most secluded areas, but one which has now attracted the unwanted attention of the world as speculation over the ex-Harrovian's demise intensifies. Suspicious: The reception area of the Nanshan Lijing Holiday Hotel in Chongqing, China, where British businessman Neil Heywood was found dead, apparently poisoned after threatening to expose the corrupt dealings of the wife of Communist Party chief Bo Xilai . Private: The three-star resort, also known as the Lucky Holiday Hotel, is one of the most secluded areas of the city and was well-known to Mr Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, the prime suspect in Mr Heywood's alleged murder . Questions remain: It is thought that Mr Heywood was killed in one of the mountain-top hotel's £600-a-night villas, but details of his demise are sketchy . Today, the British Prime Minister told China's propaganda chief that the investigation must observe due process and address concerns raised about his suspicious death. Mr Cameron was meeting Politburo member Li Changchun at No 10 to discuss efforts to deepen the UK’s trade and cultural relationship with China, as well as bilateral co-operation on global issues like Iran and Syria. But the PM was also planning to raise the death of Mr Heywood. Mr Heywood was a friend of the family of Bo Xilai, a former rising star in Chinese politics who served as local party chief in Chongqing, but was suspended from the Politburo in April amid allegations of 'serious discipline violations'. Keeping up the pressure: David Cameron meets China's propaganda chief Li Changchun at Downing Street today where he sought reassurances that the probe into Mr Heywood's death would follow due process . Strengthening ties: Mr Cameron was meeting Politburo member Li Changchun at No 10 to discuss efforts to deepen the UK¿s trade and cultural relationship with China . State media reports in China have . suggested that investigations by authorities there indicate Mr Heywood . was a victim of homicide. Unconfirmed . media reports suggest that police suspect he may have been poisoned . after threatening to expose a plan by Bo’s wife Gu Kailai to move money . abroad. Speaking ahead of . today’s meeting, a Downing Street spokeswoman said: 'The Prime Minister . will take the opportunity to raise the case of Neil Heywood, welcoming . the launch of the Chinese investigation and emphasising that we are keen . to address concerns about the suspicious circumstances of his tragic . death. Mystery deepens: It is also alleged that ex-Harrovian Mr Heywood (above) had an affair with Mrs Kailai . 'We want to see the conclusion of an investigation that observes due process.' The three-star resort, also known as the Lucky Holiday Hotel, lies eight miles outside the metropolis atop a forest-covered mountain. The hotel has a six-floor main building, ten villas in three rows and crucially several CCTV cameras which would have captured Mr Heywood's final moments. According to the first Chinese report of his death, Mr Heywood was found in one of the hotel's 'apartments' or villas, which cost up to £600 a night. Chinese police blamed his death on excess alcohol and his body was promptly cremated without a post-mortem examination. But reports yesterday claimed the father-of-two was poisoned because he was threatening to expose a web of money and corruption surrounding Mrs Kailai. It was the first time a specific motive has been revealed for his murder, a death which ended Chinese leader Bo Xilai's hopes of emerging as a possible head of the Communist Party. Mrs Kailai, knew the hotel well and hosted at least one dinner party there, it was reported in the Daily Telegraph. She has been named as a prime suspect over claims she arranged for Mr Heywood to be poisoned with potassium cyanide. Mr Bo, 62, has not been named as a suspect in the case, but is under virtual house arrest while he faces a Communist Party investigation. Foreign Secretary William Hague also said today that Britain wants to see 'the conclusion of a full investigation that observes due process, is free from political interference, exposes the truth behind this tragic case, and ensures that justice is done'. Torn apart: Gu Kailai with her husband and former Chongqinq leader bo Xilai with their son Bo Guagua . He told MPs that the Chinese investigation into Mr Heywood’s death was launched after repeated requests from the UK. In a written statement to the Commons, Mr Hague said Chinese officials initially informed the British consulate-general in Chongqing that Mr Heywood’s death on November 15 last year was due to 'over-consumption of alcohol'. But he said the Foreign Office was made aware on January 18 of rumours within the British expatriate community calling into question the Chinese police findings. A British official was present at the cremation and friends and  colleagues of Mr Heywood have questioned why UK diplomats seemingly allowed it to go ahead without pushing for crucial forensic checks first. Mr Heywood, who had known the Bo family for more than a decade, was said to have confided in a friend about the alleged affair with Mrs Gu, saying it had ‘left his life under threat’. Mr Bo was Communist Party leader in Chongqing at the time. Internet reports claimed Mrs Gu, who was godmother to the Heywoods’ two young children, met Mr Heywood’s widow Wang Lulu in a cafe two days after his death, accompanied by two armed policemen. The politician’s wife was said to have begged Mrs Heywood to agree to a swift cremation without a post-mortem examination.","Images emerge as British PM seeks assurances at No.10 .

A £30 million art gift which includes Tracey Emin's controversial unmade bed, has been snubbed by the nation. The Tate Modern said no thanks to the offer from advertising guru Charles Saatchi who donated the best of his private collection for free two years ago. And although the Government welcomed the move, the Arts Council turned the collection down because they wanted to 'pick and choose' pieces. Unmade bed: Tracey Emin's controversial work of art which is owned by Charles Saatchi . Saatchi's bequest in which he promised to cover future costs of storage, insurance, maintenance and restoration, has more than 200 works by several of the world’s leading contemporary artists. Valuable: A ceramic urn by Grayson Perry . These include ceramic urns by Grayson Perry, Zhang Dali's Chinese Offspring featuring life-size naked figures strung up by their feet and Ghost by the Algerian artist Kader Attia, consisting of hundreds of praying figures made from aluminium foil. Emin's bed - nominated for a Turner prize and exhibited at The Tate - consisted of items from the artist's room (such as condoms and a pair of knickers with stains), while other detritus, included a pair of slippers. Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt thanked Saatchi for his 'incredible generosity' describing the collection as being of huge international importance. Mr Hunt said: ' This is an outstanding example of how . Britain can benefit from individual acts of social responsibility.' But the offer unravelled when the Government-funded Arts Council, which looks after 7,000 . modern and contemporary works for the nation, asked to select some pieces and not others. Saatchi then withdraw the offer. His spokesman told the Sunday Telegraph: 'Things didn’t work out with the Arts . Council because they wanted to pick and choose from the gift, which we . felt was a bit rude. 'Charles is still keen to make this gift to the . nation.' An Arts Council . spokesman said: 'We discussed all . aspects of the proposals with the [Saatchi] gallery’s management to find . a way of realising his ambitions, however no firm decision on the issue . was reached.' Art work: Kader Attia's Ghost consisting of figures made from aluminium which are part of Saatchi's collection . Hanging in the gallery: The famous Zhang Dali Chinese Offspring featuring life-size naked figures . Donation: Charles Saatchi . Saatchi, 69, married to the cookery writer and broadcaster Nigella Lawson, has had several offers from abroad to exhibit the collection, but wants to keep it in this country. He has suggested it could be lent to museums, ministerial offices and galleries around the country, and as a bonus, the gift would include other pieces that could be sold to buy new acquisitions. The offer was rejected by the Tate Modern's director Sir Nicholas Serota. Saatchi once describing the museum's Turner Prize as 'pseudo-controversial rehashed claptrap'. A spokesman for the Tate was quoted in the Telegraph as saying: 'Charles sent Nick the list [of works] but as Charles was in discussions with others, we didn’t intervene.' Much of the collection, described by artist Perry as the 'cream of the crop', has been displayed in  Saatchi galleries, including its current base in the former Duke of York’s barracks in Chelsea. He is understood to be 'extremely disappointed' that the collection’s future remains in doubt.","Charles Saatchi offered his collection for free two years ago .

"By . Tony Bassett . UPDATED: . 09:31 EST, 7 September 2011 . A mother-of-two had a 'first date from hell' after she was duped into becoming the getaway driver for a thief she met on Facebook. Leah Gibbs, 23, had planned to spend an evening watching a DVD and getting to know 21-year-old Adam Minton. But instead, when she arrived at his home, he asked her to give him a lift - claiming he briefly had to visit a friend. Romantic: Adam Minton, left, took Leah Gibbs, right, out on a first date after meeting on Facebook, and used her as a getaway driver without her knowing . She drove him to a shopping area, where he left her for five minutes. When he returned in a panic he ordered her to: ""Go, go, go!"" She drove back to his house, but as his personality had changed and he had become rude towards her, she decided the date was over. Just as he was trying to coax her into the house, the police arrived and they were both arrested. Miss Gibbs was astonished to find police accusing him of robbing a betting shop at knife point, and her of being his accomplice. She was forced to spend a night in a cell before police accepted her story and she was freed. Minton has now been jailed for four and a half years. Mugshot: Minton has now been jailed for four and a half years for robbery . Miss Gibbs, from Tylorstown, South Wales, said: 'I thought I would be ending the night in Adam's arms. Instead, he had landed in the long arms of the law and I was facing jail. 'I'm not a bad person. I was duped. It could have happened to anyone.' She was only freed when Minton convinced police she had not been involved and knew nothing about the robbery. She added: 'I'm grateful he told the police I knew nothing of the robbery, but still bitter he involved me.' Minton had worn a black bandana and threatened a cashier with a large kitchen knife. He got away with £250. But the cashier was able to give police the car's registration number which led to the prompt arrests. Merthyr Crown Court heard last month that Minton first told police he carried out the robbery because of a drug debt. He later claimed he had a gambling problem. The court also heard he had a record for violent offending. The incident is the latest ‘date from hell’ to emerge and follows Twitter users taking to the social media site to speak of their own experiences. The tales were posted online this week after columnist Rhodri Marsden shared his own disastrous experience at a pub in Clapham. He wrote on Twitter: 'I've just walked past the Firefly, where I went on a date in 2002 that was so bad I heard myself say ""So, what's Wigan like, then?""' He later explained: 'We had nothing in common, and nothing to say. 'The silences became excruciating. She was from Wigan, and I actually heard myself saying: ""So, what's Wigan like, then?""' The post led to hundreds of his 17,000 followers telling snippets in up to 140 characters.

The widow of alleged Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev has started to reject the strict Muslim rules her husband forced upon her, it has been claimed. Katherine Russell, 24, is living at her parents' home in Rhode Island with her daughter by Tsarnaev, and her family is encouraging her to convert back to Christianity, according to reports. She has also changed her name back to Katherine Russell from Karima Tsarnaeva, the name she adopted after marrying Tsarnaev, who was killed earlier this year following a police shootout. Moving on: Katherine Russell (left), the widow of suspected Boston bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev (right), is reportedly rejecting the Muslim faith she adopted when she married him . 'Katherine is slowly starting to change,' a source told the National Enquirer, adding that she is already wearing fingernail polish and eating at fast food restaurants. It had previously been reported that she drastically changed after meeting Tsarnaev while at a club during her college years. She is cooperating with officials in the investigation, but claims she had no idea her husband was plotting to bomb the Boston marathon as she was working 80 hours a week as a health care aide. 'Katherine was completely sub­servient to him,' a source told the Enquirer. 'She cowered around him.' She has not been accused of any . wrongdoing, but the FBI have questioned her to find out if . she had any clue as to her husband's plans. Widow: Katherine Russell is pictured three days after her husband was killed following a police shootout. Sources say she has now backed away from their Muslim beliefs and uses her maiden name . Innocence: Katherine's family are trying to get her to convert back to Christianity, as in her school days . The bombing at the marathon's finish line on April 15 killed three people and injured more than 260. Tsarnaev . and his brother Dzhokhar, originally from Chechnya, are believed to . have carried out the attacks due to their radical jihadist beliefs. Her lawyer Joshue Dratel, from New York, said that he joined Russell's legal team . to help her navigate the criminal justice system and to protect her . interests. He said she had spoken with investigators and planned to keep co-operating. 'I . don't see that changing in the foreseeable future,' he said. 'There's . no inconsistency between that and her interests at this point.' She was widowed when Tamer­lan was killed in a police shootout on April 19 – four days after he and his younger brother Dzhokhar allegedly set off bombs during the Boston Marathon. Three people were killed in the cowardly attack and 264 more were wounded, sev­eral of whom lost limbs.

Dzhokhar, 19, is in a prison hospital . facing charges that could bring the death penalty. Tamerlan, 26, died . on April 19 after a shootout with police. Russell, . 24, had been living in Cambridge, Massachusetts with her husband and . two-year-old daughter, but has been staying with her parents in North . Kingstown, Rhode Island, since the day her husband was killed. Among the questions about Russell is what she knew or saw in the weeks leading up to the bombing, and in the days after it. Two U.S. officials have said that Dzhokhar told investigators the bombs were assembled in the small apartment Russell shared with her husband. One of her lawyers has previously said she was working long hours and was frequently away from the apartment.","Katherine Russell is living with her family in Rhode Island and they are encouraging her to convert back to Christianity, according to reports .

A 33-year age-gap is nothing when you find the one – and when she is 106 years old there is not a second to lose. That is what Gavin Crawford, 73, thought when he met his ‘princess’ Marjorie Hemmerde in a nursing home three years ago. The elderly couple from Melbourne, Australia are proof that you can never be too old to fall in love. Just a number: 106-year-old Marjorie Hemmerde met her 73-year-old boyfriend Gavin Crawford at a Melbourne care home three years ago . Neither Mr Crawford nor Miss Hemmerde ever married and agree that they did not expect to ever find true love. ‘We just sort of melted into each other,’ Ms Hemmerde, a former librarian, told Herald Sun. 'We get along like old friends, the age gap doesn't seem to matter.’ Mr Crawford, describing his girlfriend as ‘cheerful and appreciative’, said: ‘Marjorie is very outgoing and has good outlook in life.' ‘I think we both have learned that life is far too short not to enjoy it.’ Never too late: Gavin and Marjorie are rarely apart, even for a moment, saying life is 'too short not to enjoy it' But despite time running against them, Miss Hemmerde, a sprightly 106-year-old who holds the record of the oldest person to ever kiss Ireland’s Blarney Stone, has declared that marriage is not on the cards. ‘I'm too irresponsible,’ Ms Hemmerde said. ‘I quite like living in sin.’ Staff at Kew Gardens Aged Care Facility called the relationship ‘beautiful and genuine’. ‘It proves it's never too late,’ social life manager Vicki Fraser said.","Gavin Crawford, 73, is head over heels for his girlfriend Marjorie, 106 .

Presidents Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua and Nicolas Maduro of Venezuela said Friday they were willing to grant asylum to National Security Agency intelligence leaker Edward Snowden. Snowden has asked for asylum in several countries, including Nicaragua and Venezuela. Whereas Ortega cautiously stated his offer, Maduro spoke out against the United States and championed Snowden for telling the truth about the government's global spying programs. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro (center) and Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega have offered former NSA contractor Edward Snowden asylum in their countries . 'As head of state, the government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela decided to offer humanitarian asylum to the young American Edward Snowden so that he can live (without) ... persecution from the empire,' Maduro said, referring to the United States. He made the offer during a speech marking the anniversary of Venezuela's independence. It was not immediately clear if there were any conditions to Venezuela's offer. 'In the name of America's dignity ... I have decided to offer humanitarian asylum to Edward Snowden,' Maduro proclaimed during a military parade marking the country's Independence Day, Reuters reported. Venezuela and Nicaragua are the first two countries to approve NSA whistle blower Edward Snowden's application for asylum out of the 20 countries he applied to . 'He is a young man who has told the truth, in the spirit of rebellion, about the United States spying on the whole world,' Maduro said. In Nicaragua, Ortega said he was willing to make the same offer 'if circumstances allow it.' Ortega didn't say what the right circumstances would be when he spoke during a speech in Managua. He said the Nicaraguan embassy in Moscow received Snowden's application for asylum and that it is studying the request. Nicaragua's President Daniel Ortega has said he will grant Snowden asylum 'if circumstances allow it' 'We have the sovereign right to help a person who felt remorse after finding out how the United States was using technology to spy on the whole world, and especially its European allies,' Ortega said. Snowden is currently believed to be holed up in the transit area of Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport, according to the news agency. Russian officials have neither confirmed nor denied his presence there, though they have announced that the transit area is neutral territory. Snowden will only have crossed over on to Russian soil if he passes through the airports customs. Snowden is currently believed to be in the transit area of Moscow's Sheremetyevo International Airport (pictured here). The Russian government has declared this area neutral territory . Even if Snowden was to accept the Latin or South American government's offers it remains unclear how he will get into the countries. As Reuters noted, the are no direct commercial flights between Moscow and Venezuela. The most common route involves transferring in Havana and there is no word yet if the Cuban government will let Snowden pass. Snowden's journey could prove challenging as the United States has made it clear they are monitoring the skies for his presence. Snowden is quickly running out of options for asylum as Iceland recently denied his request and Russian authorities have made it clear he cannot stay in the country much longer . Yesterday, Bolivan President Evo Morales's plane was grounded in Austria after it was suspected that Snowden was abroad. Though Snowden has yet to choose a country for asylum his window to do so may be closing rapidly. According to Reuters, the Moscow authorities have made clear they are eager to expel him from their country. The deputy foreign minister said that Snowden will not be allowed to stay in Russia much longer as they have not granted him asylum, the news agency reports. Venezuelaís President Nicolas Maduro condemned the United States for their spying tactics while praising Snowden for speaking out . The 30 year-old whistle blower was also recently denied asylm in Iceland. WikiLeaks now reports that Snowden has asked an additional six countries to take him in, though they will not reveal which countries due to 'attempted US interference,' Reuters reports. This new report brings the total number to 20 countries where Snowden has applied for asylum.","Venezulan President Nicolas Maduro and Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega have granted Edward Snowden's request for asylum in their respective countries .

In separate tweets, WBC thanked God for the fire and also said they would picket the funerals of the 19 heroic firefighters who lost their lives fighting the blaze.

Taking it a step further, WBC then tweeted a press release praising God for the fire. ‘God sent the Arizona wildfire! Revere and honour him… not those vile human creatures!’ As if that wasn’t bad enough, the realse also said that they dead firefighters are in hell and pleading for God to send WBC to picket their funerals. Even more outrageously, a WBC spokesperson took to Twitter to call the fire a ‘marvelous work of God’ that makes WBC ‘bow in humble thanks and praise to God!’ Reaction on Twitter to these proclamations was annoyed, to say the least. Some people warned WBC not to set foot inside Arizona, while others called them trash. The spokesperson’s tweets were made with degrading comments about a child she allegedly had out of wedlock.

The basement of the Austrian house where Josef Fritzl kept his daughter as his sex slave for 24 years has been sealed with concrete. Elisabeth Fritzl was imprisoned from the age of 18 in the cramped and . windowless 18 square metres cellar by her father who repeatedly raped her. She gave birth to seven children while held captive in the cellar - with three of them ending up trapped inside with her. But the cellar has now been closed up with 200 tons of concrete after the house became a bizarre tourist attraction. Josef Fritzl, pictured left, imprisoned his daughter in a tiny cellar, pictured right, underneath their family home in Amstetten, Austria, for 24 years and had seven children with her. It has now been filled with cement . Closed off: Building materials can be seen in the garden of the house of Josef Fritzl in the village of Amstetten last month as builders filled the basement up with concrete . Walter Anzboeck, the liquidator of Fritzl's estate, has previously said the move is to ensure the dungeon - where Fritzl repeatedly raped his terrified daughter and refused to let his trapped children see daylight - can never be entered again. The 76-year-old Fritzl was sentenced to life in prison in 2009 after being convicted of holding his daughter captive in a windowless cellar, fathering her seven children and for responsibility in the death of one of them. He kept three of them with him and his wife Rosemarie, who was oblivious to what lay beneath her home. She thought the three children had been abandoned by Elisabeth after Fritzl convinced her that their daughter had ran away and the evil rapist masqueraded as the children's grandfather. It was the critical illness of Elisabeth's 19-year-old incest daughter Kerstin in April 2008 which finally heralded the end of the secret cellar and its inhabitants. Destroyed: The garden of the house of Josef Fritzl, who kept his daughter captive for 24 years and fathered seven children, pictured being sealed off with concrete last month . In captivity: Elisabeth and her children lived in claustrophobic and cramped conditions . Investigation: Forensic police officers investigate the house of Joseph Fritzl in Amstetten, Austria . Under pressure from a terrified Elisabeth, who warned that Kerstin would die unless she received medical attention, Fritzl took her to hospital. The house on Ybbsstrasse in Amstetten, Austria, became a world-wide symbol of evil after the revelation and planning officials at Amstetten City Hall approved an application to pull down the house in a secret closed session. The task involved putting up special barriers designed to stop the demolition, which took two weeks, from being filmed by the media. The 43-year-old and her children are now living in a remote town in the Austrian countryside. Of the seven children she bore, one died shortly after birth, three were allowed upstairs to live with her father and mother Rosemarie, and the other three remained underground, never seeing daylight.

A frantic search is being carried out today after a boy was seen yelling for help as he was dragged into a van on Independence Day. A police helicopter and door-to-door search is being carried out in Virginia after witnesses saw what they believed to be an abduction. The child, who was wearing a red and white shirt and blue pants, was last seen riding his bicycle in Spotsylvania when a witness says he was dragged into a light blue van. Search: FBI agents and Virginia police are trying to find a 12-year-old boy after reports of a kidnapping . Although no missing children have been reported police say they have credible evidence to believe it was a kidnapping. 'We have a 24-hour emergency operation command center set up to deal strictly with this case,' Captain Jeff Pearce, of Spotsylvania County Sheriff's Office, told ABC News. The bicycle the child, who appeared to be about 12, was allegedly riding has been found by police, but they have not yet found the blue work van he was dragged into. 'A witness called 911 after . they saw a boy kicking and screaming for help and resisting a man who . was trying to put him in a blue construction van,' Captain Pearce said. 'We . have several similar descriptions of that van as well as credible . information to make us believe this is an abduction.' The van had been seen in the neighborhood several times in the past week, according to NBC 12. The alleged kidnapper is described as a white or Hispanic man who was wearing a white tank top and dirty pants. Discovery: This bicycle was found abandoned near to where witnesses saw a child being dragged into a van . Extensive: Officers are carrying out a door-to-door search for the boy . Because no one has come forward to report a missing child, police have not yet launched an amber alert. 'Even if this is only a parental or . custodial situation, whoever knows the boy needs to give us a call. Until . they do, we are erring on the side of caution and treating it as an . abduction,' Captain Pearce said. The FBI is helping state police with the search by sending agents and helicopters.","FBI joins hunt after passerby calls up about possible kidnapping .

Showcasing a bare midriff may be one of this year's hottest trends, but apparently crop tops come with an age limit. Women should ditch belly-baring tops by the age of 34 and avoid showing off midriffs in bikinis as soon as they reach 40, a new study has suggested. Researchers found two thirds of women believe certain clothes should come with a 'wear by' age  - regardless of the condition of your body - with most trend-led items deemed unsuitable by the big 4-0. Ditch the crop: A new survey found that women should ditch belly-bearing crop-tops by the age of 34 (like Pink) and avoid showing off midriffs in bikinis as soon as they reach 40, like Heidi Klum . Miniskirts, hot pants and belly button piercings should also be avoided after your mid-thirties. The belly bashing didn't stop there as women are also being told to avoid baring their tummy or showing too much skin if they have stretch marks and scars, if they're pregnant, married or have children. The study of 2,000 women found that it's not just crop tops and bikinis that the over 30s need to avoid with the miniskirt being labelled as 'too old' for those aged 37 or above, while hot pants should be ditched at 35. Leggings should also hit the bin by 37 and stilettos are a no-no if you are in the 41plus age group. Belly button piercings should be removed by the time you turn 35 while long hair should be given the chop at 42 to a shorter more 'mature' look. And 27 per cent believed ladies should stop shopping in 'younger' clothes stores like Topshop and Miss Selfridge once they reach their early forties. Chop chop! Long hair should be given the chop at 42, Denise Richards (L) and Christine Applegate's (R) age, to a shorter more 'mature' look . Over a fifth of those polled said they would put age aside and show off their body if they had a flatter or less bloated looking tummy like celebs but admitted they found it incredibly hard to achieve. Another 16 per cent believe in the mantra 'if you've got it, flaunt it'. It also emerged that it's not just women who should put limits on their wardrobe, as the results also showed that men should give their beloved football shirts the boot at the age of 25. Researchers also found that women are taking the lead from celebrities with 67 per cent of those surveyed saying famous females are making it more acceptable for women to wear belly-bearing clothes after a certain age. Top tum: 43-year-old Gwen Stefani beat off stiff twenty-something competition to be crowned best celebrity tummy, followed by Cheryl Cole . And Gwen Stefani came out as the biggest 'flat tum' inspiration after being crowned the most inspirational celebrity midriff. The 43-year-old No Doubt singer beat off stiff twenty-something competition from the likes of Corrie heartthrob Michelle Keegan and Rihanna to prove she is no top of the flops in the tummy department. Jennifer Aniston, Halle Berry and Kate Hudson, who are also in their forties, were listed amongst the top 10. A spokesman for . All-Bran, who carried out the research, said: 'People may say ""if you've got it, . flaunt it"", but it seems that this isn't always the case for some of our . wardrobe staples.

'It's . alarming that the crop top or bikini is causing such widespread 'midriff . mayhem' and women actually believe it should come with some kind of a . wear by date. 'Ultimately, it . should come down to how confident you feel about your stomach and body - . if you have worked hard to maintain a flat tum, you should be able to . show it off. 'But for some . women, a flat, less bloated tummy can prove elusive no matter how many . stomach crunches they do and mean they aren't comfortable in revealing . clothes as they get older. 'However, . the secret can be as simple as making a few small dietary changes like . eating a fibre rich breakfast cereal every day, which is proven to ease . bloating and that swollen tum look. 'Thankfully it seems like the celebs have got it sussed when it comes to understanding the relationship between feeling good on the inside and looking great and are not afraid to show off their midriffs- whatever their age.' Contenders: Rihanna and Kelly Brook were also voted as having some of the best tummies in the business .
