"(CNN) -- Investigators pleaded for help from the public Wednesday in their search for two kidnapped Tennessee girls and the man accused of abducting them and killing their mother and sister. The FBI added the suspect, Adam Mayes, to its list of 10 most wanted fugitives and added $100,000 to the reward fund offered for a break in the case. Mayes has been charged with killing Jo Ann Bain and her eldest daughter, Adrienne, in late April, but authorities believe he is still holding Bain's younger daughters, 12-year-old Alexandria and 8-year-old Kyliyah. ""From an investigative standpoint, we keenly and firmly believe that Adam Mayes is out here somewhere with these two young children,"" said Mark Gwyn, director of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. ""And it's going to be up to the public to help us if we're to bring these children back home and place him in custody where he needs to be."" The search is now concentrated around Guntown, Mississippi, where the bodies of the mother and daughter were found over the weekend. ""We are moving forward with our investigation to hunt down Adam Mayes and rescue those two little girls,"" Aaron Ford, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Memphis office, told reporters Wednesday. He urged Mayes to leave the girls in a ""safe location,"" such as a police station, church or hospital, ""and then peacefully and safely turn yourself in."" The federal reward brings the total amount of money offered for information leading to Mayes' arrest to $175,000, Ford said. Mayes' wife, Teresa Mayes, and his mother, Mary Frances Mayes, are in custody, but Mayes himself continues to evade a small army of 17 law enforcement agencies and hundreds of searchers. The two young sisters were the targets of a kidnapping plot that involved the killing of their mother and older sister, a Tennessee court document states. Adam and Teresa Mayes each have been charged with two counts of first-degree murder and two counts of especially aggravated kidnapping. Adam Mayes faces an additional count of making a false report, according to arrest affidavits filed in Tennessee. In an interview with police, Teresa Mayes said her husband intended to take Alexandria and Kyliyah from their home in Hardeman County, near Memphis. Read the affidavits (PDF) Police said she told them she was in the Bains' garage where Adam Mayes killed Jo Ann and Adrienne Bain. Details about time or cause of death haven't been released. But in the affidavits, investigators said Adam and Teresa Mayes drove the bodies to Union County in northern Mississippi, where they were discovered Saturday in a shallow grave behind Adam Mayes' mother's house in Guntown. The mother, Mary Frances Mayes, has been charged with four counts of conspiracy to commit especially aggravated kidnapping. Authorities describe Mayes as a white man with blue eyes and brown hair, 175 pounds and 6-foot-3. He recently cut his hair and may have done the same to the missing girls. In security camera video shot April 30 at a convenience store near his home, Mayes is seen with short hair and a goatee. Nick Bargouthi, the clerk seen in the video, told HLN's ""Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell"" that Mayes was a frequent customer. ""He walked in, went in and bought a Coke,"" Bargouthi said. ""I noticed he cut his hair, got rid of his pony(tail). When I asked him, he said, 'Yeah, it was too hot.' But he kept all his facials on. And then he walked out."" He was last seen May 1 in Guntown. While the search is centered around his hometown, he also has connections to Arizona, Texas, Florida and the Carolinas, the FBI says. Teresa Mayes' lawyer, Shana Johnson, said her client is cooperating with police but would not say whether she knows the whereabouts of Adam Mayes or the girls. The Mayes family and the Bain family are connected through Adam Mayes' sister Pamela, who used to be married to Jo Ann's husband, Gary Bain, the lawyer said. Adam and Teresa Mayes have been married for 11 years and lived in Guntown, she said. Johnson said she has asked for a mental health evaluation of her client. Bobbi Booth, Teresa Mayes' sister, spoke to CNN's Anderson Cooper on Tuesday about Adam Mayes and his relationship with her sister, who she said has mental health problems. ""I've known Adam for at least 25 years, and he's always been weird and unusual ... but I never dreamed he would do something like this,"" she said. She described him as aggressive and not trustworthy. He beat and threatened to kill her sister, said Booth, who pleaded with him to ""do the right thing."" ""Just let the children go. This has gone on way too far, and we need to figure out what's going on, and it's not fair to the children,"" she said. Authorities tried to interview Mayes soon after Gary Bain reported his wife and the girls missing April 27 in Whiteville, a western Tennessee town of 4,600 people. However, Mayes fled, officials said. Mayes may be using the alias of Christopher Zachery Wylde or Paco Rodrigass, his Facebook profile name, according to the bureau. Ellen Fulghum, a guidance counselor at the high school Adrienne Bain attended, told HLN there was ""a dark cloud"" over the school and community."" ""It's just a heaviness. Our hearts are heavy,"" she said. ""It's one of those situations where, as adults there's no way we can wrap or minds around something like this,"" Fulghum added. ""It's very hard to help children through a grieving process when it is something of this nature."" CNN's Rich Phillips and Natisha Lance contributed to this report.","NEW: The case leaves a ""dark cloud"" over a Tennessee town, counselor says .

"(CNN) -- Halle Berry married French actor Olivier Martinez in a private ceremony in France on Saturday, her representative confirmed Sunday. It's the third marriage for the Oscar-winning actress, who announced in April that she is expecting a baby with Martinez. Berry, 46, and Martinez, 47, have been close companions since meeting on the set of ""Dark Tide"" last year. He was by her side through the last months of her bitter custody battle with ex-boyfriend Gabriel Aubry, the Canadian model who fathered her 5-year-old daughter Nahla. They reached ""an amicable agreement"" over custody last November, a week after a fistfight in Berry's Hollywood driveway between Martinez and Aubry. Berry was previously married to former pro baseball player David Justice -- from 1993 until 1996 -- and singer Eric Benet -- from 2001 to 2004. ""I feel fantastic,"" Berry told CNN when discussing her pregnancy in April. ""This has been the biggest surprise of my life, to tell you the truth.

"(CNN) -- Deputies in Arizona's Maricopa County will leave white wooden crosses at desert locations to mark the spots where immigrants die as they try to enter the country from Mexico. Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who made the announcement, said 14 people have died since June in the area known as Gild Bend. More than 30 people have been rescued in the same area, he said at a Thursday news conference in the desert south of Phoenix. ""Desert crossers are dying in unknown numbers due to the desert's brutal conditions and excessively high temperatures,"" the sheriff said. He said the crosses, made by inmates, also will serve as landmarks so people in distress in the desert can give their location when they call for help. The sheriff criticized the federal government for failing to seal the border and said it should reimburse his county for ""the time and resources spent on these mercy missions."" Arpaio is known for his strict approach to immigration enforcement in Maricopa County and has been at odds with the federal government over immigration policy. In May, a federal judge agreed with the Justice Department that his deputies were illegally detaining Hispanics on pretexts to try to find undocumented people. Arpaio has said he will appeal the judge's ruling, which stopped a program of traffic sweeps.","Sheriff cites 14 recent deaths of border crossers in desert heat .

"(CNN) -- When is a kiss not just a kiss? It's not always clear. Russian athletes Kseniya Ryzhova and Yulia Guschina kissed each other over the weekend on the winners podium after taking gold in the women's 4x400 meter relay at the World Athletics Championships in Moscow. A photographer captured the moment, which was broadcast by media outlets around the world. Was it just a celebratory kiss? Or was it a political statement? The athletes have not said. But their kiss came at a highly charged moment for gay rights in Russia, which recently implemented an anti-gay propaganda law. The law, which bars the public discussion of gay rights and relationships anywhere children might hear, has led to calls to boycott the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. U.S. runner Nick Symmonds blasts Russia on gay rights . Gay rights campaigners have drawn parallels between Moscow's actions and Nazi Germany's persecution of Jews or apartheid in South Africa. Russia, meanwhile, insists that its law barring ""propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations to minors"" is not discriminatory but is intended to protect children. Almost three-quarters of Russians said homosexuality should not be accepted by society, while just 16% said it should be accepted, a recent Pew Research Center survey of global attitudes revealed. By comparison, 33% of people surveyed in the United States said homosexuality should not be accepted by society, while 60% said it should. In Britain, only 18% opposed accepting homosexuality, with 76% saying it should be accepted. Russian athlete defends Russia's anti-gay propaganda .

"(CNN) -- A Miami imam convicted of funneling tens of thousands of dollars to the Pakistani Taliban was sentenced Friday to 25 years in prison. U.S. District Judge Robert Scola levied the sentence against Hafiz Khan, a U.S. citizen and Pakistani native who ran the Miami Masjid, also known as the Flager Mosque. A jury in March found Khan, 78, guilty of four charges that accused him of supporting and conspiring to support terrorists and a terrorist organization. The charges alleged Khan, who prosecutors said ran the Miami mosque since at least 1999, sent money and other support from the United States to the Pakistani Taliban and its supporters from at least 2008 to 2010. The charges also accused Khan of using a madrassa, or Muslim religious school, that he founded in Pakistan to shelter and support Pakistani Taliban militants.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- There's both poetry and promise in the humble balloon. It delivered escape and adventure in Pixar's ""Up,"" friendship to a small boy in the classic short film ""The Red Balloon,"" and -- delving into real-world history now -- military messages for Chinese strategist Zhuge Liang back in 220 AD. Now Google plans to use a network of high-flying balloons to deliver low-cost Internet access to remote and under-served places around the world. It's called Project Loon, the latest initiative from the tech giant's innovation lab, Google[x]. Project Loon uses a fleet of super-pressure balloons made out of very thin polyethylene plastic. Measuring 15 meters across when fully inflated, each balloon carries a payload of electronics including a flight computer, altitude control system, communications antenna and a solar power station -- turning the craft into a self-powering cell tower in the sky. ""We want to keep them up there, floating around for eventually up to 100 days,"" Nigel Snoad, Google.org Crisis Response Product Manager and Google Project Loon team member said on CNN's News Stream. ""That way we can have a ring of balloons we hope can provide Internet access to a whole range of places that are really difficult to get to with normal technology."" The Loon balloons are strategically positioned on stratospheric winds and controlled by complex algorithms and computing power on the ground. Google said a team of six people is required to launch a Loon balloon, including a launch commander and a coordination team at Mission Control. The need for the connectivity that Project Loon promises is immense. Believe it or not, in this networked age, some five billion people are not connected to the Internet, according to Google. To put it in another way, two-thirds of humanity are being denied online connectivity and the economic promise that comes with it. Project Loon can also play a critical role during a natural disaster or humanitarian crisis. ""During a crisis, connectivity is really important because information in itself is really lifesaving,"" said Snoad. ""Anything that can (provide connectivity) for remote areas at a low cost much cheaper than satellites is something we're really going to celebrate and we're hopeful can make a real difference."" Last month, the team conducted a successful pilot test in New Zealand, launching 30 balloons over two weeks to test basic launch procedures, Internet connection to the ground, and descent and recovery of the balloons. A group of 50 pilot testers in Christchurch and parts of Canterbury on New Zealand's South Island were equipped with special Internet antennas to connect to the Loon balloons, including Charles Nimmo -- the first person in the world to connect to Google's balloon-powered Internet. ""The way I became involved in the trial was by a third-party research organization,"" Nimmo told me via email. ""They phoned one night and sounded completely suspect to the point where I was about to hang up."" Eventually Nimmo signed a nondisclosure agreement and a group of technicians arrived at his door to attach what looked like a red ball to the side of his house. ""I thought, 'Finally, some people who can tell me what is going on.' Their reply was, 'We don't actually know either.' The whole process was cryptic and was making a dull week rather exciting to be honest."" In a rural area with historically unreliable Internet access, Nimmo said he now enjoys the benefits of constant connectivity like a social media presence, an ability to better market his products online, and a stable platform for his children to complete their homework online. Nimmo is happy with his balloon-powered Net connection. And, as the world's first person to make a connection in such a way, he also recognizes the heights Google must scale to make Project Loon a viable solution. ""It is a system that will need to reach a critical scale in order to be effective world-wide and will need some degree of cooperation between governments,"" he said. ""The scale and complexity of the idea is mind-boggling but it seems plausible, and Google is probably the only company with the resources to pull it off."" Onward... and upward.","Google plans to use a network of high-flying balloons to deliver low-cost Internet .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Video posted to YouTube shows the dramatic moment a food stall exploded at a fireworks festival in Japan on Thursday evening. More than 100,000 people had gathered for the annual pyrotechnic display in Fukuchiyama city, said the local chamber of commerce and industry, which organized the event. The video shows flames leaping from the stall's awning, then screams after a second explosion less than two minutes later. People are seen lying on the ground receiving treatment, before firefighters race to the scene. Sixty people were taken to a number of hospitals, suffering from varying degrees of burns, authorities said. At one hospital alone, 16 people ages 8 to 85 years were treated for serious burns. Others were taken to more than 10 hospitals, some outside Kyoto prefecture.

"(CNN) -- The remains of a man who confessed to being the Boston Strangler were exhumed Friday by authorities working to connect him to the January 1964 killing of Mary Sullivan, the last of 11 women believed killed by the serial killer. New DNA tests on a secret sample collected from a relative of suspect Albert DeSalvo triggered the exhumation after authorities said there was a ""a familial match"" with genetic material preserved in the killing of 19-year-old Sullivan, Suffolk County District Attorney Dan Conley said Thursday. Authorities made the match through DNA taken from a water bottle thrown away by DeSalvo's nephew, he said. DeSalvo's remains were removed from Puritan Lawn Memorial Park in Peabody, north of Boston, to the state medical examiner's office, where DNA tests will be performed. Authorities said they believe the results will come back quickly, perhaps in a few days. The Strangler killings terrorized Boston from mid-1962 to early 1964. Conley said 11 killings have been attributed to DeSalvo -- who confessed to the deaths -- including Sullivan's. DeSalvo also confessed to two additional killings, which were not suspected Strangler victims. City of Fear: Photos from the Boston strangler era, 1963 . DeSalvo was never charged with the killings. He was stabbed to death in 1973 while serving a life prison term for unrelated rapes. The news has convinced Sullivan's nephew, Casey Sherman, who wrote a 2001 book in which he argued that another man may have been behind the Strangler killings. He said Thursday that he was surprised his aunt's slaying was still being investigated. ""It's taken 49 years for police to legitimately say they got their man, and they'll probably be able to say that very soon,"" Sherman said. But a lawyer for the DeSalvos told CNN the family was ""outraged, disgusted and offended"" by the decision to secretly take a DNA sample of one of its members, a move she called ""unnecessary and creepy."" ""They feel victimized by this process,"" said the attorney, Elaine Whitfield Sharp. ""This was an unwarranted invasion of privacy by a government agency. We have offered them DNA as recently as last year. There was no reason to sneak around to get it."" Scientists tried several times in the late 1990s and early 2000s to isolate DNA evidence from semen found in Sullivan's body and on a blanket, authorities said. They resumed their efforts last year, after a laboratory successfully salvaged DNA from decades-old material, and found what they believe is the unique genetic profile of Sullivan's killer. Serial Killers: Fast Facts . Despite an exhaustive search, investigators found no usable samples of DeSalvo's DNA to compare with the material from the crime scene. So Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis said he had a detective from the police department's fugitive squad shadow DeSalvo relatives until he spotted one of the suspect's nephews throwing away a water bottle. The nephew was working at an outdoor construction site when he threw away the plastic bottle, which was retrieved by plainclothes investigators, according to a law enforcement source who spoke on condition of anonymity. Conley said authorities didn't ask the DeSalvo family for their cooperation, but he defended the secret collection of their DNA as ""a fair and legal and ethical method."" DeSalvo's brother, Richard DeSalvo, offered blood and saliva samples in hopes of proving his brother's innocence in 2001. Those tests had been unable to find a match between DeSalvo family DNA and the killings, but Conley discounted them Thursday because they weren't conducted by law enforcement. CNN's Matt Smith and Bob Crowley contributed to this report.","Albert DeSalvo confessed to being the Boston Strangler .

"(CNN) -- The first former head of state to be convicted of war crimes since World War II was sentenced to 50 years in prison Wednesday by an international court in The Hague, Netherlands. The Special Court for Sierra Leone convicted former Liberian president Charles Taylor last month of supplying and encouraging rebels in neighboring Sierra Leone in a campaign of terror, involving murder, rape, sexual slavery and the conscription children younger than 15. Who is Taylor, exactly? He was also found guilty of using Sierra Leone's diamond deposits to help fuel its civil war with arms and guns while enriching himself with what have commonly come to be known as ""blood diamonds."" For victims in Sierra Leone, Taylor's verdict brings relief . Taylor directed his gaze downward while Presiding Judge Richard Lussick read the sentencing statement, which began with a horror cabinet of carnage committed in Sierra Leone by rebels from the Revolutionary United Front, which the former president backed. ""The accused has been found responsible for aiding and abetting as well as planning some of the most heinous and brutal crimes recorded in human history,"" said Lussick, who described one RUF military operation as the ""indiscriminate killing of anything that moved."" He spoke of amputations with machetes -- some carried out by child soldiers forced to do so -- and read accounts by witnesses who suffered under the violence. Opinion: Do war crimes trials really help victims? ""Witness TF1064 was forced to carry a bag containing human heads,"" Lussick said. ""On the way, the rebels ordered her to laugh as she carried the bags dripping with blood."" Upon arrival, ""the bag was emptied, and she saw the heads of her children."" A former child soldier, conscripted at age 12, in his testimony told of ""having the letters RUF carved into his chest,"" Lussick said. ""When ordered on a food-finding mission to rape an old woman they found at a farmhouse, the boy cried and refused, for which he was punished."" The prosecution had asked the Special Court for Sierra Leone to sentence Taylor, who was president of Liberia from 1997 to 2003, to 80 years behind bars, but the judges found the recommendation ""excessive,"" citing the ""limited scope"" of the conviction in key attacks. The prosecutors had failed to prove that Taylor assumed direct command over rebels who committed atrocities. There is no death penalty in international criminal law, and Taylor, 64, will serve out his sentence in a British prison. The former Liberian president is appealing his conviction and will receive credit for time already served since his apprehension in March 2006. The atrocities he was convicted of supporting occurred over the course of five years -- almost his entire presidency -- and reached a peak in 1998 and 1999. Sierra Leone's civil war lasted from 1991 to 2002, ultimately leaving 50,000 dead or missing. Although Taylor was not on the battlefield in Sierra Leone, the court saw his position of power as president of the neighboring country and the use of his own military's capabilities to stoke up RUF rebels as making him directly responsible for the bloodshed he encouraged. Taylor does not see himself as a war criminal but as a victim -- a leader wronged by corruption and a hypocritical hand of justice with a political agenda. ""I never stood a chance,"" he said last week during his final courtroom stand. ""Only time will tell how many other African heads of state will be destroyed."" Taylor accused the United States government of throwing the trial by paying prosecutors millions of dollars and claimed that witnesses had been bought. He has expressed no remorse and insisted his intent was far from what had been portrayed by prosecutors. He has described himself as a peacemaker, saying he should be spared a harsh sentence. His defense attorneys pointed to the former Liberian president's role in the peace process that ended the civil war as a mitigating factor in his sentencing. But after lengthy consideration, the panel of judges -- which in addition to Lassick included Judge Teresa Doherty and Judge Julia Sebutinde -- did not buy it. ""While Mr. Taylor publicly played a substantial role in this process ... secretly, he was fuelling hostilities,"" Lassick said, supplying rebels with arms and ammunition. Last month's landmark ruling by the Special Court for Sierra Leone against Taylor was the first war crimes conviction of a former head of state by an international court since the Nuremberg trials after World War II that convicted Adm. Karl Doenitz, who became president of Germany briefly after Adolf Hitler's suicide. Former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was tried by an international tribunal, but he died before a judgment was issued. Taylor, 64, was found guilty of all 11 counts of aiding and abetting the deadly rebel campaign in Sierra Leone. He was a pivotal figure in Liberian politics for decades and was forced out of office under international pressure in 2003. He fled to Nigeria, where border guards arrested him three years later as he was attempting to cross into Chad. The United Nations and the Sierra Leone government jointly set up the special tribunal to try those who played the biggest role in the atrocities. The court was moved to the Netherlands from Sierra Leone, where emotions about the civil war still run high.","NEW: Charles Taylor aided ""the most heinous and brutal crimes recorded in human history""

"(CNN) -- Friday. For many people, it is a word that signals the end of the week. But in Moore, Oklahoma, Friday, August 16, will mark a new beginning. It will be the first day of school since an EF5 tornado ravaged the town this spring, killing 24 people -- including seven students at Plaza Towers Elementary school. Plaza Towers and other schools in Moore have a special place in the heart of Robert Romines. He is a native of the city and, in July, became the superintendent of the public schools system. For Romines and others, the approaching school year is generating a mixture of feelings. ""There's not any one emotion: excited, happy and there's also some grief still there. We are about rebuilding, moving forward -- not just for the school district, but also for the community,"" says Romines, who is himself a product of the Moore school system. A total of 26 schools were impacted by the combination of the May 20 tornado and another storm several days later. As a result, Romines estimates those properties suffered at least $55 million in damages. Plaza Towers and another school, Briarwood Elementary, were considered total losses after taking direct hits. Both schools will have temporary locations this year, with groundbreakings set to take place soon on new foundations. It's a plan Romines says will put the two buildings on track to re-open in August of 2014. And as Moore students prepare to hit the books this week, their teachers are stocking up on supplies and readying their classrooms, thanks to donations from corporations, charities and the public. To date, Romines says much of that assistance has come in the form of products. But he adds that, as rebuilding nears completion, the school district's cash reserves will be stretched. And he stresses that money will be critical to the system's daily operations going forward. ""We want to rebuild bigger and better and for student safety. Monetary donations in the form of cash for tornado relief to our general fund would be very helpful. We do ask donors to be specific about where they want the money to go. A lot of checks and money orders have said 'tornado relief to Moore public schools.' We've worked hard to keep that separate so we can track where that goes."" One way you can assist is through the Rising from the Storm fund, which can be accessed through Moore Public Schools or directly at Fundly.com. For those who prefer to donate via phone, Romines encourages them to call (405)735-4223. And the superintendent has a message for those who continue to keep the residents of Moore in their thoughts: ""We are strong, we are resilient. We are moving forward, rebuilding and doing what's best for the community with the understanding that we won't forget that day or the families and lives affected by the storm. We're here for the long haul."" For additional ways to help the students in Moore, Oklahoma, please visit the following: . Red Cross of Oklahoma .

"(EW.com) -- Lee Daniels' ""The Butler"" is an ambitious, sweeping period drama that manages to be incredibly affecting and feel as if the words ''For Your Consideration'' are stamped across every frame. Inspired by the true story of an African-American steward who worked under eight presidents (Truman through Reagan), the film stars Forest Whitaker as Cecil Gaines â€” an unassuming man who witnesses history close-up at a time when a new chapter seems to be written daily. As proof of how radically the world will change during his lifetime, the story begins with Cecil as a boy working on a cotton plantation, where his employer (a fragile, haughty Vanessa Redgrave) teaches him how to serve white folks: ''The room should feel empty when you're in it.'' Years pass, and Cecil lands a job at a ritzy D.C. hotel, where his white-gloved obsequiousness grabs the attention of a White House aide, who hires him. As the film skims Forrest Gump-style through turbulent decades and various inhabitants of the Oval Office (a fun but distracting parade of famous faces, including Robin Williams as Eisenhower, John Cusack as Nixon, and Alan Rickman and Jane Fonda as the Reagans), Cecil struggles with his messier home life. It's the only place where his gift for orderliness fails him. His wife (a beautifully nuanced Oprah Winfrey) is an alcoholic, and his older son (David Oyelowo) is a rebellious civil rights activist. Neither can draw this Invisible Man out of his shell. As Cecil, Whitaker is mesmerizing. The actor seems to shrink into his imposing frame, summoning a performance of quiet, bottled-up force. There's no question that Daniels, the director of 2009's ""Precious,"" deserves some of the credit for that. But as undeniably moving and powerful as his film is, it could have used more of that subtlety. The fact that he even comes close makes ""The Butler"" worth seeing. Grade: B+ .

"(TIME.com) -- Buildings can earn LEEDS certification for being energy efficient, so why shouldn't they qualify for being good for our health? Sustainable homes and ""green"" living have been popular trends in real estate for years now, but the latest buzzwords for buildings focus on their occupants. While hotels and spas have increasingly marketed wellness environments to attract health-minded consumers, real estate company Delos, which focuses on so-called wellness properties, is pushing the idea into residences. The company recently partnered with Columbia University Medical Center to conduct a four-year review of 4,000 scientific studies relating to health and the environment, including building technologies. Their findings are now part of a database that helps builders create spaces that are more health- and wellness-friendly. TIME.com: From 'World of Warcraft' to weight loss . Here's how it works. The data that the team of medical experts, policymakers and designers developed comprise a new certification standard that Delos calls WELL. To meet the WELL Building Standard, spaces must contribute to a person's well being by providing, among other amenities, filtered or purified air and water, as well as adequate opportunities for fitness, and even psychological comfort and nourishment in the form of proper lighting to balance mood and reduce stress. Some properties even contain behind-the-walls features such as UV sanitizers and air filters that get rid of bacteria and toxins. ""Why stop at building homes or offices or hotels that are good for just the environment? Why not also build these structures so that they are good for the people who live in them and work in them and stay in them? [We're] pushing that sustainability intention beyond just environmental and into human or biological considerations,"" says Delos founder Paul Scialla. For now, spaces designed by other developers require a partnership with Delos in order to earn the WELL designation. During this pilot phase, the standards are not public as they are with LEED certification, and the specific criteria — levels of acceptable allergens or other air particles, for example — are only available to developers who agree to meet the specifications in building their space.

The inspiration is in line with hotels that are turning more to wellness principles when designing its rooms and public spaces — a smart decision since health and wellness-related services contribute to an estimated $2 trillion industry annually. Corporate offices are slower to the trend, but are also starting to incorporate more health-focused design and environments, from filtered air to fitness facilities. Hilton and Hyatt hotels, for example, go to great lengths to accommodate guests with allergies. Both use the PURE certification, which provides allergy-free hotel rooms that boast surfaces — both hard and soft — that are treated to minimize bacterial growth, and in-room filtration systems that remove potential allergens or pollutants. The hypoallergenic rooms claim to be 99% allergen free and are re-certified every six months. On the fitness side, in 2011, Westin rolled out WestinWORKOUT rooms, which transformed hotel rooms into mini-gyms complete with a treadmill or stationary bike, dumbbells, fitness DVDs, resistance bands and stability balls. Similarly, the TRYP by Wyndham New York City keeps its fitness rooms stocked with an exercise bike and complementary exercise clothes. ""We know that 53% of travelers say that they always or often try to exercise when they're on the road,"" says Brian Povinelli, Westin's Global Brand Leader. ""Our brand mission is to enable our guests to pursue their well-being when on the road. With the brand's dedicated WestinWORKOUT Rooms, hotel guests are able to fit their regular cardio, strength training, or exercise routines into their hectic travel schedules with the added luxury of a private workout at any time."" While some of these programs are undoubtedly marketing efforts to compete for consumers, there is a body of research suggesting that design can make a difference in health. For instance, the University of Tulsa's Indoor Air Program studies ways to improve indoor air quality in homes, schools and workplace environments. Currently, its scientists looking at the differences in various types of flooring to see how each impacts dust collection, cleaning methods and recirculation of settled particles. This particular project is focused on finding healthier breathing environments for students in schools. As for the allergy-free claims made by hotels? The researchers warn guests to be skeptical and keep in mind that while the room may be relatively sanitized, people may bring with them allergens that can't always be whisked away. ""It really depends on what is being used; some air sanitizers can actually trigger allergy symptoms,"" says Dr. Richard Shaughnessy, director of research and manager of the university's Indoor Air Program. ""Can you make a better hotel room? Sure, but I don't know how they get to the 99% allergen-free. I don't know what they're basing it on. There are things you can do to make an environment more allergy-friendly, but you have to know the details."" TIME.com: Is the 'Food of the Future' really a nutrition solution? Fitness claims are a bit easier to swallow. For its fitness-inspired designs, Delos studied ways to take advantage of living spaces to encourage beneficial physical activities. Some bathrooms in Delos properites, for example, include heated floor stones instead of tile to mimic the therapeutic effects of hot stone reflexology. ""[We thought about how design could] encourage people to walk on surfaces that are more conducive to joint health, [so we considered] things like posture and supportive flooring,"" says Scialla. Indoor lighting is another important element of the WELL Building certification. Scialla says the challenges real estate has with lighting are pretty extreme. Now that we spend that majority of our time indoors, we lose our natural connections to light, and circadian rhythms are thrown off. ""We took a lot of time studying the effects of indoor light on a person's natural circadian rhythms, on their activity level during the day, and on their sleeping patterns at night. We are very pleased with the program we have come up with that make use of different types of light and intelligent placement of these different types of light to make sure the body's circadian rhythm is not disrupted,"" says Scialla. The company has developed several Stay Well Rooms at the MGM Grand Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas, which have built-in amenities that range from dawn simulator alarm clocks to naturally awaken the body to an air purification system. Delos is finishing up its first residential homes in New York's Greenwich Village neighborhood that will bring these same concepts to people's every day dwellings. And by early 2014, the company plans to start construction of the Bloc, the first WELL Certified block of residences and commercial spots in downtown Los Angeles. So far, hotels and residential living developers have expressed an interest in the WELL certification, and the company says corporations are also eager to learn about how to both design and certify wellness-friendly work environments. By this fall, more Delos-designed spots will be open for consumers and home-owners to figure out for themselves whether their homes can really make them healthier.

"(CNN) -- On the outside, kidnapping survivor Hannah Anderson seems to be, in the words of a friend, ""doing great."" She seems her usual bubbly self, friends say, the Hannah who puts others before herself. But there are hints, they say, of the trauma the 16-year-old California girl suffered when, according to authorities, family friend James DiMaggio killed her mother and 8-year-old brother and kidnapped her. ""She's, like, acting strong for everyone and I think that's more of just, like, for her appearance, friend Alyssa Haugum said on CNN's ""New Day"" on Friday. ""But I can tell that there's something inside of her that's upset,"" Haugum said. ""Like when we're all, like, having a good time and once everyone stops laughing she gets kind of this serious look on her face."" Hannah endured what would seem for most people an unspeakable horror -- being kidnapped by a family friend who killed her mother and brother, and then spirited her away to the woods. A chance encounter with horseback riders who reported the pair to authorities led to her rescue after a brief gunfight between DiMaggio and Hannah's rescuers. DiMaggio was killed. Hannah Anderson letters found at kidnap suspect's home . While she has not spoken publicly since her release, she has seemed unusually outspoken on social media, where she has shared details of her ordeal and her feelings in response to questions from friends and strangers alike. Her postings on the social media site ask.fm -- since taken down -- have generated some controversy among some who question why she seemed so upbeat despite all that she had been through. They note she answered questions about what would in any other context be typical teen fodder -- boys, nails, hair and music -- among revelations about her capture and whether she is happy that DiMaggio is dead. ""Absolutely,"" she posted. Opinion: Are we sharing too much online? But Robi Ludwig, a psychotherapist and co-author of ""Till Death Do Us Part,"" said the posts actually could be a sign she's coping well with the trauma -- so far at least. ""I actually think it's healthy and a sign of ego strength that here's a 16-year-old girl and she wants to do what normal 16-year-olds do,"" Ludwig said on ""New Day."" ""And I think it's really smart of her to talk, to try to put what happened to her in perspective and the way 16-year-olds do. That is, they turn to social media,"" she said. ""She wants a support system. She's getting that when she's talking and interacting with people, so that's healthy."" Hannah addressed the issue herself on the ask.fm site. ""I'm trying to stay strong. And get out the truth,"" she wrote. ""You don't know I could be crying answering these questions at the moment."" It's in Hannah's personality to try to be strong for everyone else, said friend Kylah Hayes. ""She's really like an outstanding person,"" Hayes said on ""New Day."" ""Like, she's always like putting others before her."" But, Ludwig said, Hannah is almost certainly in ""denial and shock."" ""What has happened to her probably doesn't even feel real yet,"" Ludwig said. Affidavits: mother, brother 'tortured and killed' And that she would seem to look good from the outside, even able to talk about mundane teen interests despite losing two family members and enduring a harrowing ordeal at the hands of someone who had been a family friend shouldn't be altogether surprising. ""This is not the most difficult time for someone who is grieving because you have a lot of support of people around you, a lot of attention,"" she said. Darker times are almost certainly ahead for the girl, Ludwig suggested. ""The difficulty comes when everybody forgets and you're left in your life, one year, two years, three years down the road, and the people and the crowds are not there."" That's in part why Hannah's rural community came together Thursday to host a fundraiser for her. The money raised will go toward Hannah's needs in the future. Any extra will be donated to support exploited children, said her father, Brett Anderson. He added his own take on how she's doing: ""Hannah sends her love. She's doing good day by day, and we'll keep moving forward from here."" CNN's Casey Wian, Greg Botelho, Ed Payne, Matt Smith and Paul Vercammen contributed to this report.","Kidnapping survivor Hannah Anderson is ""acting strong for everyone"" a friend says .

"(CNN) -- Another actor was injured Thursday night while playing the role of Spider-man in ""Spider-Man Turn Off the Dark"" on Broadway, according to a statement released by the show's spokesman Rick Miramontez. Actor Daniel Curry is in stable condition at Bellevue Hospital after sustaining an injury to his foot during last night's performance, the statement said. Despite the injury, Miramontez claims that the technical aspects of the Broadway show are in working order and that equipment malfunction played no role in the injury. The show is scheduled to continue on as planned. ""Our thoughts are with Daniel and his family,"" the statement concluded. Curry's injury on Thursday occurred almost two-and-a-half years after a series of other maladies and safety concerns caused the show's opening to be postponed several months. In March 2011, the show's lead actress T.V. Carpio was hurt performing in an onstage battle scene, according to a spokesman. In December 2010, actor Christopher Tierney also suffered an injury while wearing the red mask of the Marvel Comics superhero. He suffered four broken ribs, a hairline skull fracture, a broken scapula, a bruised lung, three cracked vertebrae and broken bones below his elbow as a result of his fall, his father said. The accident was serious enough to prompt producers to announce new safety measures. Additionally, in December 2010, an actress suffered a concussion offstage during the first preview night. After the series of headline-catching injuries and accidents, the musical's debut was put off for the sixth time after the producers replaced their director. The producers said the delay would give the show's creators time to work on various revisions, including improving the musical arrangements and sound quality. The revised version of the show opened in June 2012.","An actor was injured onstage during a Broadway performance .

"Mount Fuji, Japan (CNN) -- At the start of a three-month reporting stint in Tokyo, I'd thought vaguely to myself how I wouldn't mind climbing Mount Fuji when my assignment was done -- in the way that I've always vaguely wondered about running a marathon, but never got round to it. Fuji, after all, is a mountain close to the hearts of all Japanese, an icon of this beautiful country ... and front cover of the Lonely Planet, which I had furnished myself with prior to departing Berlin, my regular reporting base. Then when my producer, Yoko, told me that she'd found coming down Fuji worse than running a marathon, I thought to myself, ""It'll never happen."" One day on an early morning flight to Nagasaki, Yoko and I flew over Fuji -- the most breathtaking view of the mountain I've had, and the photo that's got the most likes I've ever had on Facebook. Then a month ago I was sent to Seoul and told I wouldn't be returning to Japan -- my dream of climbing Fuji was relegated to wistful ""it was never meant to be"" status. But no. This Saturday I have to be back home in the UK. It was always a hard ""out date"" from Asia. And now the chance has arisen. We'll be accompanying a team from Google as they chart a route to the summit of the 3,776-meter (12,388-feet). My colleague, Anna Coren, was meant to do this last week but the weather was too bad so the trip was postponed. Cultural gem . The Google Street View Trekker team plans to map out a path up to the peak for the first time. Mount Fuji was recently granted UNESCO World Heritage status -- though the U.N. panel classified it as a ""cultural"" rather than ""natural"" heritage site because it had ""inspired artists and poets and been the object of pilgrimage for centuries."" The plan was to leave the mountain at 6 p.m. local time on Friday and depart on my flight to Europe the following morning. I banked on my frantic last-minute HIIT (high intensity interval training) sessions -- courtesy of my Seoul producer KJ -- to help me deal with my fitness so I could better cope with issues such as altitude sickness. But if 300,000 other people manage to climb Fuji each year, then so could we. Follow Diana on Twitter too . Rather than a dose of nature, I readied myself for human traffic jams up towards the peak. It's a heat-wave in Tokyo, the perfect time to escape. Fuji-San, we're ready for you! Perfect conditions . The weather was perfect when the party set off. We were treated to some fantastic views as we traversed to 3,000 meters. At this point we had around 700 to go by the afternoon, so everyone prepared to climb into the evening. The only slightly troubling thing was that our companions from Google -- our reason for being here -- seemed to be having a few ""technical problems."" The last thing we heard was that they'd had to ""reboot"" the camera -- which is technically 15 cameras set on top of a green contraption on the back of some poor fellow who has to carry all 18kg up the mountain. Poor Google -- they had to turn back last week because of bad weather. But this would not stop us from finishing the climb. Remarkably our cell phones still worked and I was not feeling the effects of the altitude. We were overtaken by a few Fuji marathon runners who can take the mountain in around 3 hours flat; that's at the end of July. It was also nice to have CNN's long-time friend Hiro Sasso with us. He helped out with our coverage during the devastating earthquake and tsunami that struck eastern Japan in 2011. Sasso is a member of the Japan alpine club and the person to speak to about all things Fuji. He's climbed it ten times -- he even showed me the route he skied down in May. Not recommended though. If you fall on that ice, he says you'll need an ice-axe to stop, otherwise you'll slide to your death. So only for extreme skiers -- his words. I also discovered that Pot Noodles are a Japanese invention. Can this be true? At any rate if I could remember how they tasted the last (and possibly only) time I ate them, I'd say they'd never tasted so good. But as it is, up here at altitude, that salty and shrimpy mixture was nothing short of perfection. Plus in Japan you're allowed to slurp them, making the experience all the more fun. As we neared the summit, everyone seemed 100% fit. However, CNN producer Junko started to feel nervous about what was still ahead. She was part of last week's aborted venture and said her muscle ache only went away yesterday.

"(CNN) -- From the first moment I spoke with Ted Cruz, it was obvious that the former solicitor general for Texas had a bright future in politics. My first interview with Cruz, at the Southern Republican Leadership Conference in 2010, came less than a month after Congress passed the Affordable Care Act. Cruz, who was not quite 40 at the time and still contemplating his political future, already had the ACA firmly in his sights. ""We are facing from Washington the greatest threat to our liberty we have ever seen,"" he said, ""I think we have to fight on every front to repeal Obamacare."" Cruz didn't want to shy away from a court fight, but predicted that conservatives would have to win with voters more than judges to succeed. Less than a year later, Cruz would throw his hat in the ring to succeed Kay Bailey Hutchison in the Senate and continue his fight from Washington rather than Texas. After only seven months in town, Cruz's political talents are obvious. His drive to push the Republican Party into a budget showdown over Obamacare reflects his passionate opposition to the ACA and a shrewd assessment of the temperature of the grassroots base. He's also a staunch opponent of the Gang of Eight immigration reform bill, a position based first on his principles but clearly consonant with many rank-and-file Republicans. The immigration bill pitted him against another talented Republican newcomer, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, one of its authors and vocal proponents, although both are allied on the strategy to overturn Obamacare. Cruz's rapid ascent has rallied conservative activists and has many speculating over his potential impact on the 2016 presidential race. In fact, enough people are speculating on it that Donald Trump and Ann Coulter have been moved to cast doubts on his eligibility to run. (Cruz was born in Canada, but his mother is a native of Delaware and a U.S. citizen, which would qualify Cruz as native-born under the broadly accepted definition of the term.) Opinion: Ted Cruz can be president, probably . Cruz has recently begun to tour Iowa, usually a good signal of presidential ambition, while Slate reported this week that social conservatives in the state are pushing to get Cruz into the 2016 race. No one doubts that Cruz has a bright future in the Republican Party, but that doesn't mean the future is now. Cruz, like Rubio and Rand Paul, have only barely arrived on the national stage and are many years younger than their sell-by date. None of the three has held executive office yet. Both Paul and Cruz have only won one election in their career. All three have made an extraordinary impact as freshmen senators, but they are still mainly untested outside of a single electoral cycle. Additionally, Republicans have more options: By the time 2015 rolls around and candidates have to commit to a run, a number of GOP governors will be staking out their ground as well. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie will almost certainly use his considerable media presence and blunt style to launch the next phase of his career. Scott Walker has to win a re-election bid in Wisconsin in 2014; a win will re-establish his fighting credentials on budgets and reform. Mike Pence got some attention early in the 2012 cycle as a potential presidential contender, but decided to go home to Indiana to add executive office to his already-impressive conservative credentials. Susana Martinez, who like Cruz was given a featured-speaker slot at the national GOP convention last year, should sail to a 2014 re-election in New Mexico, with approval ratings that have never dropped below 60%. This wealth of proven executive talent, most from governors who have courted the conservative grassroots, makes the Beltway bids from freshmen senators look even more like long shots. That's not to say that we may not see a President Ted Cruz in the future. With his talent and political savvy and his potential for staying power, no one should count him out in the long run. Like Paul and Rubio, though, his potential presidential future may be 2020 or 2024. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Edward Morrissey.","Edward Morrissey: Ted Cruz has bright future with GOP, some say he's mulling presidential run .
He says that would be great -- in perhaps 2020; same with young comers Rand Paul, Rubio .

"(CNN) -- Miriam Brown has always wanted to visit Cape Cod, but when she recently began to plan a trip and found out she would have to pay $200 or more a night for lodging, her dream vacation seemed out of reach. Miriam Brown and her husband bartered their services for room and board on Cape Cod. Brown, who lives in New Orleans, Louisiana, is an accountant. Her husband is a home renovations contractor. Like many people dealing with a soft real estate market and high food and gas prices, they just don't have that kind of extra cash for a trip. ""I have traveled a lot in prior years, but after [Hurricane] Katrina, there's just no money for traveling,"" Brown said. So she still plans to go, but she won't spend any cash at all on lodging. Brown has joined the growing ranks of Americans who are bartering -- trading goods and services without exchanging money -- as a way to cope with tough economic times. Brown posted an ad in the barter section of the online community Craigslist last month, offering to trade her accounting skills and her husband's knack for home repairs in exchange for room and board on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. She has lots of company. There were some 142,000 listings in the barter section of Craigslist in July, or almost double the number posted during the same month last year, according to Craigslist spokeswoman Susan MacTavish Best. ""When the economy turns unfriendly, Craigslist users become far more creative to get their everyday tasks done,"" Best said. Swapping 'to get by' Other Web sites that put Americans in touch with like-minded people who are willing to trade everything under the sun have also seen a boost in traffic. SwapThing, which lists almost 3.5 million ""things"" available for trade, reports its customers are bartering for different reasons than before. ""I think a few years ago it was more for fun,"" said Jessica Hardwick, SwapThing founder and CEO. ""But we've seen a real shift in the last year, and especially an increase in the last few months, where I think people are really doing it to get by."" Some of the most popular items to trade for late this summer were school uniforms, which some parents found they could not afford to buy for their children, Hardwick said. Experts aren't surprised Americans are becoming more financially creative during an economic downturn. ""Historically, when times get tough, you see a 50 percent-plus increase in bartering as a way for people to be able to buy things or get things and do it economically,"" said C. Britt Beemer, chairman of America's Research Group. The company talks with thousands of consumers every week to gauge their spending habits and attitudes. A couple of years ago, many Americans had $500 to spend at the end of the month, but that money has evaporated because of rising prices, Beemer said. ""We've never had a time, at least in my lifetime, where you have food and fuel going up at the same time. So it isn't a question of buying things, it's a question of buying nothing,"" Beemer said. Breast implants and a horse . Businesses have long recognized the benefits of bartering, and there are hundreds of barter networks set up across the country to fill their needs. They use barter credits as currency, so a plumber in need of a filling doesn't need to search for a dentist's office with plumbing problems to make a deal. He can fix a leaky pipe for one member of a network and use the credits he earned for that job at any other. Since all kinds of companies are members, the trades can be all over the map, said Michael Krane, president of Green Apple Barter Services in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His company has brokered everything from breast implants to college tuition to a horse. ""Really, there are no limits to it. We trade for just about anything you can think of,"" Krane said. Bartering on this scale is also robust in tough economic times. Krane said his exchange has seen a 20 percent rise in barter transaction volume in the first six months of this year. A longtime client is Thomas Forrest, an orthodontist in suburban Pittsburgh who barters his services for everything from office improvements to stationery. His practice hasn't been affected by the economic downturn, Forrest said, but some of his patients seem glad to be able to visit him under the barter arrangement. ""I think if you have a business owner who has children in need of braces, I sense a gratitude that that's available,"" Forrest said. Barter exchanges must carefully document all trades, since the Internal Revenue Service considers income from bartering as taxable. However, a barter exchange ""does not include arrangements that provide solely for the informal exchange of similar services on a noncommercial basis,"" according to the IRS. In New Orleans, Brown and her husband are getting ready to go to Cape Cod after finding a taker for her bartering offer on Craigslist. The couple will work five hours a day in exchange for staying in ""a beautiful three-bedroom house right in the center of it all,"" Brown said. ""We can do a lot more if we don't have to pay for room and board,"" she added.","Many Americans are bartering as a way to cope with tough economic times .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- An AEG Live lawyer made an embarrassing mistake in the Michael Jackson wrongful death trial -- confusing HLN host Nancy Grace with the Jacksons' former nanny. It happened Thursday as attorney Kathryn Cahan cross examined Taj Jackson -- Michael Jackson's oldest nephew -- who had just described a close and lovely relationship between the late pop icon and his three children. Did Taj Jackson think Grace Rwaramba -- who served for years as the nanny for Prince, Paris and Blanket Jackson -- was ""dishonest at times,"" Cahan asked. The judge ordered him to answer, overruling a Jackson lawyer's objections that the question was irrelevant to the case. ""I have not experienced her dishonesty,"" Jackson answered. Cahan then presented something she apparently thought would discredit Jackson's testimony, showing he was not being honest. It was a ""TwitLonger"" message posted online by him on December 11, 2011. TwitLonger is a service that allows users to post longer messages on Twitter. Taj Jackson was discussing his dislike of journalist Roger Friedman, who he called ""anti-Jackson"" and a ""sneaky snake."" ""Sorry... but there are a couple of people who truly disgust me. And to me, he belongs in the same category as Grace, Dimond, and Bashir,"" he wrote. Does that document refresh his recollection of your opinion of Grace Rwaramba, Cahan asked. ""That's not the same,"" he responded. ""That's Nancy Grace!"" It took several seconds for the loud laughter in the courtroom to subside. Dimond is Diane Dimond, a journalist unpopular with many Jackson fans for writing a book about Jackson's child molestation trial, and Bashir is the journalist who conducted a series of interviews with Jackson that fans blame for triggering the molestation charges. Grace Rwaramba -- not the TV host -- is expected to testify in the next week about her observations of Michael Jackson's relationship with his children. If jurors decide that AEG Live is liable for damages in Jackson's death, they will have to place a monetary value on the emotional loss his children suffered. Two handwritten notes found in Jackson's bedroom by the family were read to jurors Thursday in an effort to demonstrate the love. Taj Jackson identified one as the handwriting of Paris, who was 11 when her father died: ""Dear Daddy, I love you so much & I'm so glad I got a goodnight hug. Sleep well. I love you and good night. I'll see you tomorrow. XOX Goodnight. Lots of love Paris Jackson"" The other note was Michael Jackson's handwriting: ""Words of Blanket my son, 6 years young. 'What's your favorite letter Daddy? Mine is 'G' for God and D for Daddy' age 6, Blanket."" Jackson lawyer Deborah Chang suggested the father's note showed how dedicated he was to his children since he took time to write down what his young son said. An expert in entertainment economics will be on the stand when the trial enters its12th week Monday in a Los Angeles court. Certified Public Accountant Arthur Erk, who audits the earnings of some of the world's biggest entertainers, will give his opinion on how much income Jackson would have earned had he not died of a propofol overdose while preparing for a comeback tour four years ago. Jackson's mother and three children contend that AEG Live, the promoter and producer of the ""This Is It"" concerts, was liable for the the negligent hiring, retention or supervision of Dr. Conrad Murray, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter. AEG Live lawyers argue it was Jackson, not their executives, who chose and controlled Dr. Murray and that they had no way of knowing about the dangerous propofol infusions he was giving Jackson to treat his insomnia.","AEG lawyer thought online posting would discredit Taj Jackson's testimony .

"(CNN) -- A Pennsylvania baseball team awarded a 64-year-old man free funeral services after he wrote a winning essay as part of a promotion. The Lehigh Valley IronPigs, a minor league baseball team from Allentown, promoted the essay contest. It asked fans to describe their perfect funeral in 200 words or less. After judges from the team's staff and a participating funeral home reviewed the entries, Steve Paul, from Freemansburg, emerged as the winner. Paul will receive a funeral package valued at nearly $10,000, courtesy of Reichel Funeral Home in Northampton. It includes a free casket, body removal and preparation, use of the funeral home for any viewings and ceremonies, a vehicle to transfer the remains, as well as the professional services of the funeral director and staff. It is the most valuable prize ever awarded to a fan in the team's history. The idea for the promotion was thought up at an annual fall retreat that team general manager Kurt Landes and his staff take every year. They received about 50 entries, Landes said. ""Some were very jovial and lighthearted, some were very serious, and many were in-between,"" he said. "" A lot of people spoke about their love of baseball."" Among the entries, one man offered to wear an IronPigs T-shirt at his funeral. Another wanted his ashes sprinkled over the field by a hang-glider. Another essay detailed how he wanted his ashes placed behind home plate so that he could always second-guess the umpire, Landes said. Though many of the essays were humorous, Paul's heartfelt essay won the judges over. It described his unexpected diagnosis with ALS, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease. Sharing the burden of ALS . ""The disease is racing, as my family must watch the strength, energy and life quickly drain from my body,"" Paul wrote. ""No one was prepared, emotionally or financially, for the loss or to prepare a final memorial."" Paul's perfect funeral will be an intimate affair with just his family and friends present to ""laugh, cry and tell anecdotal stories."" He hoped to win the funeral not for himself, but to help his relatives who ""must now deal with a very rapidly approaching time of loss."" ""My memorial should not be morbid or sad, but a gathering to enjoy and celebrate life and family I dearly loved,"" Paul wrote. The contest ran throughout July. After the winning essay was read at Tuesday night's game, and Paul arrived in his wheelchair to accept his award, the entire crowd roared in support. ""It really turned into a very heartwarming and really tear-jerking moment,"" Landes said. The funeral contest was meant as a celebration of life, not a glamorization of death, Landes said. It's one of many contests and fun promotions that the team sponsors every season. The IronPigs made headlines this year with the installation of a urinal gaming system. It was a promotion sponsored with the Lehigh Valley Health Network to remind men to get checked for prostate cancer. ""You actually play the game by directing your stream,"" Landes said. ""We have about four or five games on rotation, but our most popular is one where you control a snowmobile with your stream and you try to hit penguins. The more penguins you hit, the higher your score."" When you walk by the men's bathroom, you often see people high-fiving each other or joking about their high scores, he said. Before, during and after the game, videos remind men about the importance of checking for prostate cancer. The point of all of these promotions, Landes said, is to bring the community together and create an atmosphere of excitement around the team and the games. ""What's most important for us is to promote that atmosphere of creativity and community. We always want our fans to be excited about what's next,"" Landes said.","Steve Paul to receive a funeral package valued at nearly $10,000 .

"(CNN) -- Now on the waiting list for a heart transplant, Anthony Stokes had a procedure Friday to insert a device to support the failing heart he has, a family spokesman said. The 15-year-old had a ventricular assist device, or VAD, implanted on Friday at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston, family friend Mark Bell told CNN. A VAD is a mechanical pump that's used to support heart function and blood flow in people who have weakened hearts, according to the National Institutes of Health. It includes a small tube that carries blood out of the heart into a pump, and another tube carries blood from the pump to blood vessels. The vessels deliver the blood to the body. VADs can be used in people waiting for a heart transplant or those ineligible for a heart transplant, as a long-term solution to help with heart function. They can also be used during or after surgery while the heart recovers. Bell says Anthony is doing ""extremely well."" Citing patient privacy, a hospital spokeswoman declined to confirm Anthony's VAD procedure, and referred CNN to the family for related inquiries. The teen has been in the hospital since July 14, according to CNN affiliate WSB-TV. Anthony's health has come into the national spotlight because the hospital first told his family he was ineligible for a spot on the heart transplant list, according to his family. But Tuesday, according to Bell, doctors reversed that decision and gave him top priority. An August 7 letter, which Bell provided to CNN, said that ""Anthony is currently not a transplant candidate due to having a history of noncompliance, which is one of our center's contraindications to listing for heart transplant."" Noncompliance generally means that doctors doubt that a patient will take his medicine or go to follow-up appointments. In a statement Tuesday, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta said, ""While there has been misinformation circulating, Children's cannot discuss the specifics of this case or any other case due to privacy rules."" The hospital earlier had said it was working ""closely with the family"" to find solutions. Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston is in good standing, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing, the nonprofit organization in charge of transplant coordination in the United States. A matter of compliance . Assessing compliance for potential transplant recipients is important because if a patient doesn't strictly take all required medicines as directed, he or she could die within weeks of leaving the hospital, said Dr. Ryan Davies, a cardiothoracic surgeon at the Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children in Wilmington, Delaware, who is not involved with this case. But Bell said a doctor told the family that Anthony's low grades and time spent in juvenile detention factored into that assessment. ""The doctor made the decision that he wasn't a good candidate because of that,"" Bell said. ""I guess he didn't think Anthony was going to be a productive citizen."" Anthony's mother, Melencia Hamilton, told CNN affiliate WGCL-TV that doctors said Anthony would live only three to six months if he didn't get the heart transplant. In the meantime, the story became public in local media. The Southern Christian Leadership Conference's Georgia chapter got involved because Anthony's family called, and the organization has ""a longtime relationship with the child,"" said the Rev. Samuel Mosteller, the chapter's president, . Mosteller said Anthony was judged based on ""tattoos and an ankle bracelet"" from a ""juvenile agency."" Bell said the detention was because Anthony got into ""an altercation to protect his younger brother."" On Tuesday, Bell said, a doctor delivered the groundbreaking news to the family: ""He said that Anthony has been approved to receive a heart. He put him on the transplant list."" Bell said doctors told Anthony he'll likely receive a new heart in about three to four months, but that this timetable could change. Anthony had no health problems before this summer, Bell said; the heart problem is not congenital. But he started to have trouble sleeping and then complained about his chest hurting. His mother took him to the hospital because of the chest pains. Bell said Anthony is excited and his mother overjoyed after the hospital's reversal. The teen is now considered top priority for a heart transplant; he just has to wait for one to become available. The complexity of transplants . Federal records show that 3,400 people were on waiting lists for heart transplants in 2012, but only 2,000 of these procedures were performed. While waiting for a heart transplant, 331 people died. Dr. David Weill, medical director of Stanford University's Lung and Heart-Lung Transplant Program, said it's not unusual for patients to be rejected from organ transplant lists because of noncompliance -- in other words, if they are seen as people who won't follow instructions about taking medications and seeing doctors. At Stanford, Weill's group evaluates about 300 patients per year for lung transplants and turns down about 1% to 2% because of noncompliance. It's about the same for heart transplants as well, he said. As part of the evaluation process, organ transplant patients undergo a complete psychosocial evaluation so doctors can get a sense of whether they and their families will follow through with a complicated medical regimen, Weill said. ""A few times a year, we run into people who can't,"" he said. A patient would not be turned down solely for having served prison time or having bad grades, Weill said, but ""we would want to look at the entire picture."" Some patients have been denied because they don't have anyone in their lives who can take care of them and accompany them to appointments. After a heart transplant, patients are too sick to do these things alone, Weill said. ""When we fear that someone's not going to do well, it's because the patient couldn't comply with the regimen or they don't have any support in their life,"" he said. Psychosocial factors don't change a person's priority on the waiting list, but they could lead a person to be denied a spot on that list, he said. The trouble with teens . Arthur Caplan, head of the division of medical ethics at NYU Langone Medical Center, noted that patients have to adhere to a lifelong regimen after receiving an organ transplant -- showing up at medical appointments, taking medications, monitoring changes in health -- and teenagers in general don't have a good track record of following orders. Teenagers aren't automatically ruled out for heart transplants, but ""the consequence that 'you are going to die if you don't take these medicines' is far from the mind of a 17-year-old,"" said Davies, the cardiothoracic surgeon. Instead of denying Anthony a spot on the transplant list, Caplan suggested that the boy should be counseled and worked with intensively so he understands what's expected post-transplant -- that is, if the teenager can get a heart. Bell said the family didn't press the doctor on what led to overturning the decision regarding the transplant list. Personally, Bell attributes it to ""the handiwork of God and the media pressure."" In a video released by a family friend to CNN affiliate WSB before the reversal, Anthony plays chess and looks longingly outside his hospital window. The hospital did not comment on what led to doctors' change of heart.","A 15-year-old in Georgia initially told he couldn't be on heart transplant list .
His family learned this week he's being put on the transplant list .

"(CNN) -- New York City is appealing a federal judge's finding that the police department's stop-and-frisk searches violate the constitutional rights of minorities, according to documents filed Friday in a Manhattan court. The city filed its notice of appeal after U.S. District Judge Shira A. Scheindlin ruled that changes must be made to the policy because it unlawfully targets blacks and Hispanics. NYPD report: Most of those 'stopped and frisked' are minorities . The city intends to follow up its notice of appeal by asking for a stay of the judge's order that was issued Monday, said Kate O'Brien Ahlers, a spokeswoman for the city's Law Department. Scheindlin, ruling on a class-action lawsuit, found that the police department's policy violated plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment rights barring unreasonable searches, based on statistics showing police made at least 200,000 stops from 2004 to June 2012 without reasonable suspicion. She also found evidence of racial profiling, violating plaintiffs' 14th Amendment rights guaranteeing equal protection. ""We think the judge could not be more wrong,"" Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in his weekly radio address Friday on the ""John Gambling Show"" on WABC. The police department had said that the policy -- in which police stop, question and frisk people they consider suspicious -- is used to deter crime. NYPD officers say they had stop-and-frisk quotas . The lawsuit, filed in 2008, went to trial for nine weeks this spring. The lead plaintiff in the case was David Floyd, a medical student who was stopped twice -- once in the middle of the afternoon when he was in front of his home in the Bronx, according to the suit. N.Y. judge halts 'stop-and-frisk' tactic outside Bronx building . Coupling this week's ruling with a similar decision in January, Scheindlin ordered that the policy be altered so that stops are based on reasonable suspicion and in a racially neutral manner. She appointed Peter Zimroth, a former chief assistant district attorney in Manhattan, to develop and oversee near-term reforms, including changes to the NYPD's policies and training. She also called for the creation of a pilot project where NYPD patrol officers in five precincts -- one per borough -- must wear video cameras. The chosen precincts would be those with the most stops in 2012. ""The recordings should ... alleviate some of the mistrust that has developed between the police and the black and Hispanic communities,"" and ""will be equally helpful to members of NYPD who are wrongly accused of inappropriate behavior,"" Scheindlin wrote. New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly called Scheindlin's finding of racial profiling ""disturbing and offensive."" ""We do not engage in racial profiling. It is prohibited by law,"" Kelly said earlier this week. ""We train our officers that they need reasonable suspicion to make a stop, and I can assure you that race is never a reason to conduct a stop."" Bloomberg said the policy was one of a number of programs that helped the city's murder rate drop -- it's 50% below the rate when he took office nearly 12 years ago, he said.

"(CNN) -- At every congressional recess, the question remains: What has Congress accomplished to advance medical innovation, or for that matter any of our national priorities? A ritual of leaving town with no meaningful action on pressing issues seems to have taken hold as lawmakers once again meet with voters in their districts. Indeed, much will happen during this break, but as elected officials hold yet another town hall meeting, Facebook or Twitter chat or public event, thousands will be diagnosed with cancer or get the dreaded confirmation from a physician that they or a loved one has Alzheimer's disease. Thousands will suffer a heart attack or stroke, and thousands of parents will learn that their child has a rare disease. Researchers are racing against the clock to identify a new gene or molecule that could lead to the next medical breakthrough and bring us closer to cures and new therapies to halt disease. Time is of the essence in the scientific community, but unfortunately, our elected leaders continue to squander precious time in political, ideological battles that yield little or no results. Is this the Congress you elected? This is not the first elected body to tackle formidable challenges, but it may be the first that has failed miserably in addressing critical issues that will have short- and long-term implications for the health and well-being of Americans. Spending bills to fund the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and other agencies in the next fiscal year remain in limbo as sequestration, across-the-board spending cuts enacted in March, tightens its grip on medical innovation. As a result of these mindless budget cuts, researchers are delaying or scrubbing promising studies. Institutions across the country have closed labs, reduced their work forces and implemented hiring freezes. Young scientists are rethinking their career paths or moving abroad to countries that have accelerated investments in research. Many commentators have noted that the 113th Congress is on track to be the least productive in recent history. Fewer than three dozen bills have been passed by this Congress and signed into law. This new style of legislating, when there is any, seems to be brinksmanship at the last possible moment: Hail Mary passes to avert a government shutdown and the like. If the head of a Fortune 500 company performed in this manner, he would be given the boot. Perhaps voters should think the same of those obstructionists on Capitol Hill who block action on measures to advance science and innovation the next time they head to the polls. In the meantime, it's important for all of us who care about the future of biomedical and health research to get engaged. It's a myth that members of Congress don't pay attention in the month of August. On the contrary, during this recess, they are meeting with their constituents to at least shore up support for their next campaigns. This is the time to tell them that voters are expecting action, not more heated rhetoric. It's time to tell them that tax and entitlement reform is essential -- rational proposals that will reduce health care costs and sustain investments in research and development. Research and development is now classified as an investment rather than an expense by the Bureau of Economic Analysis in calculating the gross domestic product, a sensible approach in recognizing the value of R&D in generating future income and bolstering our economy. Now, if only our esteemed leaders in Washington will do likewise. They must abandon the notion that research isn't highly valued by most Americans compared with bread-and-butter issues. In fact, more than half of Americans are willing to spend more in taxes if they were certain that all of the money would be spent on additional medical research, according to polling (PDF) commissioned by Research!America, a nonprofit advocacy alliance. Americans understand the importance of a long-term investment in medical and health research to spur private-sector innovation and produce the therapies, medical devices and treatments that will save lives. The importance of long-term priorities is, by the way, one of the ways a nation stands apart from a corporation beholden to shareholder demands for immediate return. A nation's leadership must view research through the prism of future generations: our children and grandchildren, who will benefit from both a health and economic standpoint as a result of today's scientific discoveries. Imagine a world free of cancer, free of AIDS, free of Alzheimer's, free of heart disease. It's certainly possible if elected officials get beyond the rhetoric and take decisive action to strengthen our nation's investments in research. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John E. Porter.","Former congressman John Porter says Congress has done little up to August recess .
Among the issues he says Congress hasn't tackled is more funding for health research .
He says people support more spending, and most would pay more taxes for research .
Porter: Health research is an investment that will benefit our childen and grandchildren ."
"Washington (CNN) -- First the Obama administration and the intelligence community said there was no program gathering Americans' data. Then they said the government was only gathering focused bits of data and only on foreign targets. Then they admitted intelligence operatives were gathering large amounts of data but not accessing it unless a court first gave the OK. Now it appears there are thousands of times each year when the data of Americans not suspected of having anything to do with terrorism are gathered. ""Can you understand, though, why some people might not trust what you're saying right now about wanting ..., "" a reporter asked President Barack Obama last week at a White House news conference. ""No, I can't,"" Obama said. Americans would be comfortable with the programs, he argued, if they knew everything about them. Fact-checking Obama on Snowden . ""I am comfortable that the program currently is not being abused,"" the president said. ""I'm comfortable that if the American people examined exactly what was taking place, how it was being used, what the safeguards were, that they would say, 'You know what? These folks are following the law and doing what they say they're doing.' "" But the public has learned about the National Security Agency programs in such a way that every time a new revelation is served up, it undercuts what the president or the major players in the intelligence committee just said. Here are the most glaring examples: . 1. Obama: Programs not being abused . The president tried to assuage concerns about the programs during his August 9 news conference. He said he had ordered a new review of the programs, even as he suggested Americans would be better off if NSA leaker Edward Snowden had never let the world know about them. The important thing, he argued, is for Americans to be able to trust their government isn't abusing the information it is collecting. ""What you're not reading about is the government actually abusing these programs and listening in on people's phone calls or inappropriately reading people's e-mails. What you're hearing about is the prospect that these could be abused,"" he said, adding that the special Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court was guarding against those abuses. Less than a week later, The Washington Post published a blockbuster report based on more documents provided by Snowden under the headline, ""NSA often breaks privacy rules."" The documents given by Snowden to the Post suggest thousands of accidental and some intentional infractions. The head of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court took the unprecedented step of issuing a public statement that his barebones staff can only oversee what NSA provides to it. And the Senate Intelligence Committee, one of the main overseers of the NSA in Congress, was not made aware of the internal review by the NSA -- staffers learned of the review of privacy infractions when the Post contacted them, according to the newspaper. Lawmakers pledge hearings oversight after NSA broke privacy rules . The NSA argued in a response that the infractions represent only a small fraction of the calls and data it is sifting through and they are incidental to the overall mission of preventing terrorism. Obama also noted at his news conference that a review of the programs was already under way and that Americans learning about the NSA's gathering of their data shouldn't have come through leaks. Obama takes questions from press . 2. Obama: The programs are transparent . During a combative June 16 interview with Charlie Rose, Obama dodged a question about how often the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court denies NSA requests to subpoena and analyze the data that it collects. Rose asked if the program should be in some way transparent. ""It is transparent,"" Obama said. ""That's why we set up the FISA court."" According to Thursday's Washington Post report, the court is not given all the information about every request for surveillance. And Obama has admitted that the programs needs review to assure Americans they are not violating civil liberties. Obama says NSA programs are transparent . 3. Clapper: U.S. not gathering Americans' info . The most obvious misstatement came from Director of National Intelligence James Clapper when he told Sen. Ron Wyden at a March congressional hearing that the government isn't gathering information on Americans. Wyden, who has been a critic of the programs behind closed doors, was trying to get Clapper on the record. Wyden asked Clapper whether the NSA collected ""any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?"" Clapper answered, ""No, sir."" Wyden: ""It does not?"" Clapper: ""Not wittingly. There are cases where they could inadvertently perhaps collect but not wittingly."" The nation's top spy later had to apologize in a letter to the Intelligence Committee. He admitted what he said was ""erroneous."" He told NBC that what he said was the ""least untruthful"" answer. Clapper admits error in testimony, apologizes . 4. Alexander: NSA doesn't have capability to 'flip the switch' In testimony to a House committee on June 18, Gen. Keith Alexander, the head of the NSA, had the following exchange with Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a supporter of the data mining programs: . Rep. Mike Rogers: ""Does the NSA have the ability to listen to Americans' phone calls or read their e-mails under these two programs?"" Gen. Keith Alexander: ""No, we do not have that authority,"" Rogers: ""Does the technology exist at the NSA to flip a switch by some analyst to listen to Americans' phone calls or read their e-mails?"" Alexander: ""No."" Rogers: ""So the technology does not exist for any individual or group of individuals at the NSA to flip a switch to listen to Americans' phone calls or read their e-mails?"" he repeated. Alexander: ""That is correct."" It has since become clear through subsequent leaks that the government does have temporary access to large amounts of the phone calls and e-mails sent in the United States. But the distinction that allowed Alexander to answer ""no"" is that analysts are supposed to obtain the OK from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court before doing so. That's perhaps why he said they lacked the ""authority."" Subsequent leaks in July about a program called XKeyscore printed in the UK's Guardian newspaper and in The New York Times suggested that the NSA collects nearly every phone call and e-mail. The idea is that the intelligence community is collecting the entire ""haystack"" of information that it can sift through later when it has some idea what needle it needs to find. Even if the analysts need court approval, the newer disclosures suggest the NSA has access to the content of communications, at least for a time. Documents shed light on U.S. surveillance programs . New Snowden leak: NSA program taps all you do online . 5. Alexander: 50 plots thwarted . Alexander also argued several times before Congress that information ""gathered from these programs provided government with critical leads to prevent over 50 potential terrorist events in more than 20 countries around the world."" But details of these plots have not been shared publicly. Lawmakers who have been briefed on the plots have expressed skepticism. At a July 31 hearing, Sen. Patrick Leahy said by his estimation the NSA's data showed the data collection had not foiled ""dozens or even several terrorist plots."" Officials cite thwarted terror plots, oversight in defending surveillance .","New report raises more concerns over NSA surveillance programs .

"(CNN) -- The case revolving around an alleged rape inside a Vanderbilt University dorm ballooned Friday, when police announced indictments against three more young men, one of them a standout on the Commodores' football team. None of the three faces charges of rape or another sex crime tied to the June 23 incident. They are accused over their actions after the alleged crime. Chris Boyd, a rising junior wide receiver at Vanderbilt, faces one felony count of being an accessory after the fact, according to the Nashville, Tennessee, police department. His school's athletic department, on its website, late Friday still hailed the suburban Atlanta native's on-field accomplishments and noted he is on the official ""watch list"" for the Biletnikoff Award, which is given annually to college football's top receiver. Boyd, 21, is accused of being part of an effort to cover up the alleged sexual assault ""through his advice to certain defendants who were indicted last week,"" police said. Authorities don't spell out who Boyd allegedly talked to, or what he told them. Judge Steve Dozier set bond at $25,000 for Boyd, who police said ""is expected to surrender."" Vanderbilt spokeswoman Beth Fortune said Friday that in light of the charge, Boyd has been suspended from the school's football team ""pursuant to the athletic department conduct policy."" ""All of these allegations, including those brought today, are deeply troubling, and we take them very seriously,"" Fortune said in a statement. Four Vanderbilt football players -- Brandon Vandenburg, Corey Batey, Brandon Banks and Jaborian McKenzie -- were indicted earlier this month in direct connection to the alleged rape. All four were subsequently dismissed from their team and suspended from school. Police: Ex-Vanderbilt football players in custody facing rape charges . Police said each of the four men was charged with five counts of aggravated rape and two counts of aggravated sexual battery. Vandenburg is also charged with one count of tampering with evidence and one count of unlawful photography. Two alleged acquaintances of Vandenburg were also indicted Friday. Miles Joseph Finley, a 19-year-old from Bermuda Dunes, California, and Joseph Dominick Quinzio, a 20-year-old from neighboring Palm Desert, are charged with one felony count apiece of tampering with evidence. ""They are alleged to have tampered with certain electronic evidence in the case,"" police said, without giving specifics. Finley was ""quickly apprehended"" by Riverside County, California, sheriff's deputies after initially trying to flee, according to Nashville police. As of late Friday afternoon, authorities in California were still trying to locate Quinzio. Bond for Finley and Quinzio is $150,000 each. Nashville Police Chief Steve Anderson suggested authorities aren't finished, describing the investigation as ""open and active.""

"Sydney (CNN) -- Backpacking across India in 1981 as a young man fresh out of Sydney University, Tony Abbott found what he called ""a country of contrasts, where bullock carts would take supplies into nuclear power stations."" Now the man who opinion polls predict will be Australia's next prime minister after the September 7 national election is prepared to see those power stations run on Australian uranium -- a position that goes down well in New Delhi. Abbott, a religious man whose time in India included six weeks at the Australian Jesuit mission in Bihar, leads the conservative Liberal-National opposition that is locked in a struggle for power with Labor, led by Abbott's political rival and incumbent Australian prime minister, Kevin Rudd. Australian PM announces new elections for September 7 . Uranium is the key energy commodity that differentiates how Rudd and Abbott approach relations with India. On paper, a bipartisan position . Australia, which has about a third of the world's recoverable low-cost uranium resources, sells the nuclear fuel to China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, the United States, Canada and the European Union, but not so far to India. How Australian political rivals view China . Both the Labor and Liberal parties have a policy that they will sell Australian uranium to energy-starved India. So on paper, it looks like a bipartisan position. But Rudd is a reluctant helmsman for his party's policy, believing India must accept stringent conditions before it gets Australian uranium for its power plants. In his first stint as prime minister in 2007-2010, he was adamant that because India was not a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, uranium sales to it were precluded. He said this was not a policy directed against India, but one that applied globally. When Julia Gillard, the deputy prime minister who overthrew Rudd for the leadership in June 2010 (before herself being ousted in June this year by Rudd), decided to push through a Labor Party policy change on the uranium issue in late 2011, Rudd was not consulted. Rudd has said that India does not need to source uranium from Australia. It gets most of its supply now from Russia, France and Kazakhstan. Abbott's Indian ambitions . In contrast, Abbott is happy to see Australian uranium shipped to Indian nuclear power plants. At the India Australia Friendship Fair in Sydney last year, he said: ""Yes, we will sell uranium to India because we know that India is one of the world's great democracies."" In reality, any uranium sales are years away, so the Australia-India nuclear trade is more symbolic than substantial. New Delhi views it as a touchstone for the state of the bilateral relationship. In March this year, the first official-level talks were held on a civil nuclear cooperation agreement that is the first step towards uranium sales. A prerequisite is an undertaking by India that it will not use Australian uranium in any weapons-related capacity. When Rudd addressed the Indian Council of World Affairs in Delhi in November 2009, he harked back to his days at Canberra's Australian National University, where he studied Indian civilization and its impact on China. But Rudd's primary focus has always been China. He is a Chinese speaker, a former diplomat in Beijing and a lifelong student of all things Chinese. For his part, Abbott, a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University, maintains that if he becomes prime minister he will take India seriously, ""as I have always done."" China 'not the only superpower' In an address to the Australia India Business Council in Sydney last December, Abbott said that as prime minister he would treat India as one of the key countries helping to shape the future of Australia and the wider world. ""It's important to note that China is not the only emerging superpower of Asia,"" Abbott said, pointing to the quadrupling of India's gross domestic product (GDP) in two decades and high economic growth rates. ""What's more, India is the emerging democratic superpower of Asia, and also the emerging English-speaking super power. As far as I am concerned, this means it should never be the emerging superpower that's taken for granted or neglected."" Abbott said India fell into all three categories of countries that were particularly important to Australia: ""Our neighbors, our major trading partners and our key strategic allies."" He said that by 2050, India was forecast to be the world's most populous nation. ""Unlike China, which is tipped to grow old before its citizens grow rich, India is tipped to grow rich before it goes gray."" Australia-India relations . In general, relations between Australia and India are good, up from a low point in 2009-10 when the uranium issue and a series of attacks on South Asian students in Melbourne sparked heated discussion. India in some years is the largest source of new immigrants to Australia, and Indian student numbers continue to be strong. Trade and investment flows are increasing -- India is now Australia's fourth biggest export market, taking mainly coal, gold and copper, and it has made substantial investments in Australia's mining sector. A ""strategic partnership"" launched in November 2009 by Rudd during his meeting with the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was given a further push by Gillard during her visit to India in October 2012. Negotiations for a free trade agreement began in 2011 and reached a fifth round of talks in Canberra in May. No Indian prime minister has visited Australia since Rajiv Gandhi in 1986. Since then, six Australian prime ministerial visits to India have taken place. Singh was invited to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) held in Perth in October 2011, but sent vice president Hamid Ansari instead. In the view of some political observers, Singh's no-show reflected annoyance over the uranium issue. There is also a sense that Australia strategically is not really all that important to India, which must contend with a neighborhood made up of China, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Burma and Sri Lanka. In contrast, India ranks as a top-five priority for Australia in Asia, along with China, Indonesia, Japan and South Korea. If Abbott wins office on September 7, expect Australia to give even more priority to India. If Rudd retains office, it will be a case of ""steady as she goes."" Ahead of his last visit to India in 2009, Rudd noted that like most of Australia's relationships, the one with India ""has some bumps in the road"" occasionally. ""But we can work our way through them,"" he said. Uranium likely will continue to be one of those bumps.","Hiscock: If elected, Abbott and Rudd will likely adopt different positions towards India .
Sales of uranium, which India seeks, is a touchstone issue in the Australia-India relationship .
Abbott has stated that India is the emerging superpower Australia will never take ""for granted""
Rudd, a former diplomat to Beijing, is seen as more reluctant to sell uranium to India ."
"(CNN) -- In just 12 years leading up to 2010, Vietnam cut the country's malnutrition rate in half by investing in small scale farming. Poverty in the country has plummeted from 58 percent in 1993 to 18 percent by 2006, says development charity Oxfam, who cites the Asian country as a exceptional model for others around the world. Vietnam went from being a rice importer to the second biggest exporter of rice in the world. ""The magic formula is political will and vision,"" says Hannah Stoddart, head of economic justice policy at Oxfam GB. ""Planning a government strategy and making sure the investment gets to those who need it most is the key,"" she says. Smallholder farming, a term used for small scale or family farming, is in fact the best way to describe 500 million farms globally where two billion people live and work. The term includes a wide range of producers from the most marginal and impoverished to those working in markets at a local, national or international level. Very often these farmers are women who must work to provide the food for their families. Oxfam is a staunch believer that smallholder farming is the way forward. ""All evidence in small scale farming, family farming on small plots of land, show it is one of the surest ways to relieve poverty,"" says Stoddart. Fair trade success . In Malawi, one of Africa's poorest countries, thousands of farmers are now part of the Fairtrade International (FLO) group, farming mainly tea, coffee, sugar and ground nuts. ""Malawi is the first of its kind in Africa to have a fair trade network, and there is a lot of interest in how we are doing it,"" says Frank Olok, network coordinator for the Malawi Fairtrade Network. In the last 18 months, many have seen their hardships turn into success, says Olok, who serves as the liaison between many farmers and the FLO. Watch: Planting a million trees a year to tackle deforestation . Malawi already has 30,000 farmers involved in fair trade farming methods, plus another 20,000 working on these farms. ""When we talk about smallholder farmers, we are talking about the farmer who owns one to five acres of land, using rudimentary means of farming, who is not able to easily access finance,"" says Olok. ""The majority of the farmers in Malawi today are smallholder farmers."" Indeed, says one Malawi farmer, Gladys Kayanja, whose small tea farm now has a bridge to help her get between her home and the tea field during the rainy season. ""The fair trade premium bought an ambulance which serves my family and relatives when we are sick. Before that we used to carry a very sick patient many kilometers before reaching the hospital,"" says Kayanja. Schools, electricity, irrigation, and much more has been put in place in Malawi due to the success of the cooperative-style network. A further bonus is many of the farmers then find themselves able to diversify into businesses. In southern Sudan, Rabha Elis Bandas, director and founder of the Women's Development Group, decided to take matters in her own hands after she was tired of watching local farmers suffer waiting for food aid during Sudan's civil war. She has set up her group to help farmers with supplies and the skills needed. ""There is enough land in South Sudan and it is really fertile, it just needs work. What we need and want is for people to grow their own food, not to depend on Uganda and Kenya,"" she says. As Bandas has proved, the importance of smallholder farmers is even more important in times of political strife. Hope for Haiti . In Haiti, the Smallholder Farmers Alliance (SFA), a cooperative of 2,000 farmers started in 2010, has established tree nurseries planting one million trees a year in a country which has lost 98 percent of its trees to deforestation. The SFA provides high quality seeds, tools and training, and has already helped the farmers increase their yields by 40-50 percent. One Haitian farmer said the SFA has helped her turn her life around, especially since recent hurricanes ruined her crops. ""My life situation is better,"" said Romeus Mercilie. ""I have enough food to feed my kids and the sell the remaining food at the market. I now have a dream and I know how to protect my dreams,"" she said. Mercilie says thanks to a flat interest rate loan from the SFA, she was able to restart her business, purchase new livestock and save money. Smallholder farming spells big business . From the economic side, opportunities for smallholder farmers are exponential. ""There's a huge opportunity for smallholders to sell to big businesses,"" says TIm Aldred, head of policy and research at Fairtrade Foundation. ""The risks are that you can get locked into a big supplier who holds the power and pushes your prices down,"" said Aldred, who added that recent controversy at the G8 meetings in June addressed how to empower the smallholders so they don't end up stuck in unhelpful relationships with multinational corporations. The United Nations has declared 2014 the International Year of Family Farming with the aim to support and recognize the importance of smallholder farming. By doing so, the U.N. says it will help eradicate hunger, reduce rural poverty and reach food security through sustainable production. While the scale of investment of what's needed hasn't yet happened, Oxfam says there are glimmers of hope out there with farmers learning about the market system, how to improve their yields, form cooperatives, and access credit safely. ""There's all kinds of brilliant stuff that's going on but it needs to be scaled up,"" says Oxfam's Stoddart. Once that happens, she says ""the poorest people will start benefiting from their labor.""","Vietnam cut malnutrition by half with small scale farming .

"(CNN) -- Four Americans were killed during a rocket attack at Bagram Air Base, outside of Kabul, a Pentagon official said Tuesday on the condition of anonymity. The U.S.-led International Security Assistance Force confirmed that four NATO coalition service members had been killed in an attack but did not disclose the nationality of the casualties or the exact location of the attack. ISAF said the four were killed in an ""attack in eastern Afghanistan."" The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, the group said in a statement. News of the casualties came as NATO-led troops transferred security responsibility to Afghan forces. Afghan President Hamid Karzai has said he welcomes the U.S. troop withdrawal and insists his army can defend the country against the Taliban. ""It is exactly our job to deal with it, and we are capable of dealing with it,"" Karzai told CNN's Christiane Amanpour earlier this year. Even so, there are concerns about the abilities of Afghan security forces to deal with the Taliban and other militant groups. The Taliban continue to carry out high-profile attacks in the capital, Kabul, even targeting the Afghan Supreme Court during a suicide attack in June. Another strike targeted a building near Kabul International Airport. On Tuesday, a suicide bomber attacked the convoy of Haji Mohammad Mohaqiq, a member of parliament, killing three people and wounding 21 others. Three bodyguards were among the injured. Mohaqiq -- a Shiite and an ethnic Hazara -- is a member of Afghanistan's political opposition. American forces, now at about 66,000, are expected to drop to 32,000 by the end of the year. The plan is to withdraw all combat troops but keep a residual force in the country to help train Afghan forces and carry out counterterrorism operations when needed. The size of that force is still being discussed.","NEW: The Taliban claim responsibility for the attack .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- A series of small bombs went off in and around a world-famous Buddhist temple in eastern India Sunday, injuring two people, authorities said. Four of the eight explosions occurred at the Mahabodhi temple complex, a UNESCO World Heritage site in Bihar state that houses a tree where Buddha is believed to have attained enlightenment. The temple itself was not damaged. The other four blasts hit other sacred locations around Mahabodhi, said Bihar police official S.K. Bhardwaj. A 50-year-old Tibetan and a 30-year-old Myanmar national were injured in the attack, Bhardwaj said. While no one took responsibility for the attack, suspicion fell on the home-grown Islamist group Indian Mujahideen, Bhardwaj said. The group, designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department, is blamed for dozens of deadly bomb explosions throughout India since 2005.","Four of the eight explosions take place at the Mahabodi complex .

"New York (CNN) -- It was dog, gone. That's what happened to an English springer spaniel named Hendrix that was scheduled to fly from Newark to Phoenix this week and was put on the wrong flight -- to Ireland. Six-year-old Hendrix was traveling in cargo on United Airlines on Thursday when he was put on the wrong flight, United spokeswoman Megan McCarthy said Friday. When the airline realized the dog had been put on the wrong flight, immediate steps were taken to return Hendrix to his owner, she said. The first word owner Edith Albach got about the mix-up was in a phone call from the airline 10 minutes before the flight Hendrix was supposed to be on landed in Phoenix. ""I felt like somebody punched me in the stomach. I mean, that's my dog. That's like my child,"" Albach said. While on the unexpected detour, Hendrix was walked and fed by United staff, and he was able to spend time with his owner when he returned to Newark before departing for his original destination of Phoenix, McCarthy said. Hendrix landed safely in Phoenix Friday night, affiliate KNXV reported. Albach's daughter Meredith Grant was there to let the very excited spaniel out of the kennel upon landing. ""When my mom called me I was like 'my dog got sent to frickin Ireland? How Ireland? Not even like he went to Florida...he's in Ireland,'"" she told KNXV. United apologized and offered a full refund, Albach said. But she says she isn't so sure Hendrix will be flying again anytime soon. ""I wasn't even looking for a refund. I just wanted somebody to say we screwed up,"" she said. ""That's not what they said."" Grant is happy to have her dog back, but wants United to punish the person responsible. ""They should not have their job anymore, I mean, he's been on a plane for 24 hours."" Meredith's father Joe felt helpless for his family during the ordeal. ""What do you say, except, 'I hope he gets some Guinness and corned beef and cabbage,'"" he told KNXV. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter, Jake Carpenter, and Greg Morrison contributed to this report.","Hendrix, a 6-year-old dog, was put on the wrong flight in Newark, United Airlines says .

"(CNN) -- In my life, I've often heard that ""comparison is the thief of joy."" I never really thought much about it until taking on CNN's Fit Nation challenge. If I were to compare myself to my Fit Nation teammates, I would believe I'm falling short. Will Cleveland runs something crazy like a six-minute mile; I'm steady at a 15- to 16-minute mile. Tabitha McMahon makes swimming look effortless, while I need an additional swim coach outside of Fit Nation. It would be easy to look at that and think I'm failing. Some people think comparison is a good thing. ""Why wouldn't you want to swim as well as Tabitha or run as fast as Will?"" It's not that I don't want to. It's just that I'm not there yet. When we compare ourselves to others, we can't be objective. When we look at those who seem to have it all, we beat ourselves up. But we don't have all the details of their situation. Get fit and others will follow . During my runs, I've noticed three sets of people: Those I'm faster than, those I'm slower than and those who run at a similar pace. Running allows me to stop all the noise of day-to-day life and focus on me. It's a time to cleanse my mind. If I started comparing myself to the other runners, I wouldn't be able to enjoy ""my time."" Inevitably when we compare ourselves to others, negative thoughts enter our consciousness. The negative thoughts might be directed toward ourselves or at the people to whom we are comparing ourselves. It's my experience that negativity only breeds more negativity, and that's where comparison leads. I've decided my motto for the rest of this triathlon journey, and my life, is going to be ""no comparison."" When I say ""no comparison,"" it reminds me to be present in the moment and not be defined by another's opinion because I'm the only one who knows me. It's more than a race to me . I'm getting ready to attend my 15-year high school reunion in a week, and I'm truly looking forward to it. I know some former classmates will be comparing themselves to the rest of the class, and some will even compare themselves to me. It's already happening. Daily I hear, ""I wish I had your dedication"" or ""your willpower"" and so on. Stop it people! Don't compare yourselves to me because you only see what I let you see. Every day is not smooth sailing. Even though I've lost more than 185 pounds, I still see glimpses of the old me. When I get stressed, I still want to go to food for comfort. I admit that I have broken down a couple times recently and had a piece of cake or an order of French fries. At first I beat myself up and felt guilty. Then I told myself what's done is done; get back to obtaining the life you've been dreaming of. This 198-pound me has more confidence, strength, happiness and love in her life than the 385-pound me did, and I know the 150-pound me will have even more of that than the 198-pound me. You may lose friends when you lose weight . There is a fine line between inspiration and comparison. I have many people I admire, but I don't want to be them or be like them. I've have a couple of special personal trainers in my life. Seeing them help people, including myself, become the individuals they've only ever dreamed of being has made me realize I have something to offer other than my story. Those people have inspired me to study for my personal trainer certification. I'm not setting out for Jillian Michaels status; I genuinely want to help others the way my trainers and friends have helped me. Each of us are unique and have something different to offer the world. The only person we have to be better than is the person we were yesterday. I challenge you, dear reader, to starting living a life of ""no comparison.""

"Baghdad (CNN) -- A dramatic and bloody outbreak of violence in northern Iraq Tuesday stoked even more agitation in a country simmering with Sunni-Shiite tensions. In northern Iraq, at least 28 people were killed and more than 70 wounded in clashes between security forces and gunmen in Hawija, in Kirkuk province, according to a senior Iraqi army officer who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the media. A senior Interior Ministry official provided similar information on the same condition. Police said the fighting began when security forces looking for wanted people raided al-Atisam Square, the site of ongoing demonstrations by Sunni Muslims. But Sunni politicians claim peaceful Sunni protesters were assaulted during the raid and blame Nuri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister. Iraqi House Speaker Osama al-Najafi issued a strong condemnation, saying the army fired on peaceful protesters and calling the military ""a tool to suppress the people and not to defend them."" ""We condemn in the strongest words of condemnation and denunciation the unfortunate crime committed by the army against the demonstrators in Hawija,"" he said. Al-Maliki ordered an investigation, aid to the wounded, and compensation to their families. Two Sunni Cabinet members -- Minister of Education Mohammed Tameem and Minister of Science and Technology Abdul Karim al-Samarrai -- have submitted their resignations in protest over the actions by security forces, their offices said. Martin Kobler, the U.N. special representative for Iraq, was in Kirkuk to meet with local officials and discuss the Hawija violence, state TV reported. The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad said it is working to ""help defuse political and sectarian tensions"" and it regrets that civilian and security force casualties ""took place before ongoing efforts to reach a peaceful resolution of this situation were given sufficient time to succeed."" ""All sides should immediately refrain from further violence or provocative actions,"" it said. ""We call for a transparent investigation with the broadest possible participation."" The situation is now very tense in provinces with large Sunni populations -- such as Anbar, Salaheddin, Nineveh and Diyala, according to the senior Interior Ministry official in Baghdad who also spoke under condition of anonymity. Near the Anbar province city of Falluja, police said, citizens who were angered by the Hawija events set two army vehicles on fire in an attack on an army convoy. One person was killed and another was kidnapped, police said. In a separate attack, a police officer was wounded when a bomb was hurled at a police checkpoint in Falluja, police said. In Tuz Khurmato, in Kirkuk province, at least four Iraqi soldiers were killed and four others wounded when gunmen attacked a security checkpoint. It is not clear if this attack related to the Hawija clashes or sectarian strife. And at least nine people were killed and more than 25 were wounded when three mortar rounds landed on a Sunni mosque in Muqdadiya, a city in Diyala province. Al-Najafi urged security forces and Sunni tribes battling across the country to restrain themselves, warning of a civil war if such fighting continues. Sunni-Shiite tensions . Sunnis, who comprise a minority of Iraqis, had clout during the Saddam Hussein era, but have been politically marginalized since his overthrow. Shiites, who make up a majority of Iraqis, dominate the government. Since December, tens of thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets of predominately Sunni provinces -- including Anbar, Nineveh, Salaheddin and Diyala -- demanding that the Shiite-led government stop what they call second-class treatment of Iraq's Sunni community. Such turnouts include protests at al-Atisam Square in Hawija. Over the past few months, al Qaeda in Iraq has claimed responsibility for several attacks across the country that targeted Shiite areas and Iraqi security forces. A number of attacks have targeted the Sunni community in different locations over the past week. The deadliest one was at a popular coffee shop in western Baghdad, which left at least 27 people dead and 51 others wounded. Earlier Tuesday, another attack occurred. At least four people were killed and 13 others were wounded when two roadside bombs exploded, one after another, outside a Sunni mosque in southern Baghdad, police said. The incident occurred in the neighborhood of Dora while Sunni worshipers were leaving the mosque, police said. There was some violence during Saturday's Iraqi provincial elections, but there weren't major incidents and the polling was considered a success by Iraq, the United States, and the United Nations.

"(CNN) -- It was the day before my 58th birthday. I had decided to end my 57th year doing something that was unthinkable when I turned 57. You see, eight months ago I got the unexpected news that I had been selected as a member of the 2013 CNN Fit Nation Challenge team. At that time, the main event, the Nautica Malibu Triathlon, seemed a lifetime away. I couldn't run a mile, swim a single lap or even sit clipped in on a road bike without falling. One of my most enthusiastic supporters over the past year has been a co-worker who has challenged me to do things physically that I never would have done without his support and encouragement. He challenged me to do a local 5K race one month into training when I was sure I wasn't ready. Thanks to him, I accomplished my goal of finishing the race without walking. He challenged me to hike the Manitou Incline -- a 2,000-foot vertical climb that is not for sissies! He also challenged me to ride my bike to work. Which gets me back to that fateful pre-birthday morning. Triathlete-to-be conquers first time in ocean . My daily commute is 29 miles one way, with a few serious hills. In the days before the ride, I studied the course and knew it would be a challenge. The night before, I started wondering if I had bitten off more than I could chew. The morning of the ride, I was still uneasy, at one point even regretting that I had accepted the challenge. Everything changed at 5:15 a.m., when I opened my garage door to wait for two of my friends who had generously volunteered to ride along with me. There was an immediate excitement in the air as we made our final preparations and took off, right on schedule at 5:30. It is hard to put the next 2Â½ hours into words. Just as I reached the top of the first big hill, I saw a blue car pulled off to the side of the road. I assumed it was someone with car trouble. As I got closer, I recognized the familiar face of one of my co-workers. He was smiling and clapping, cheering us on! I soon realized that he was there intentionally, something totally unexpected, giving me a mental boost and surge of energy I cannot describe. Training dedicated to slain colleague . It only got better. Every few miles, much to my surprise, dozens of my friends were staged, holding big signs and cheering me on along the highway. Once we reached our destination, my co-workers were waiting for us, cheering us into the finish line like it was the Tour de France. I have to admit that all the attention was actually a bit uncomfortable for me. I am certainly not the first person who has made this particular ride. In fact, I cannot think of a day that I drive to work that I don't see at least several fellow bikers along the way. I am still overwhelmed at the thought of so many people getting up early and going out of their way to show their support for what I was doing. It was the best birthday present ever. Throughout the day, I was repeatedly asked how the ride went, and if I was sore. My answer was that it went great, and I actually felt wonderful. Most of the credit for that belongs to my friends who rode with me, changed my flat tire, and made me feel like a superstar. Each one of them has been there for me along my fabulous journey this past year. They know where I started and have celebrated my progress. They are just as excited for the upcoming triathlon as I am. Most of all, they validate what I have known all along: I am the luckiest person in the world. At the beginning of 2013, I was feeling heavy, sluggish and tired. I had convinced myself that, at 57, that was my fate, and that I just needed to accept that feeling energetic and healthy was a thing of the past. The key to fitness? Schedule it in . From the very beginning, I have viewed my selection as a member of this year's Fit Nation team as a once in a lifetime opportunity. But being 20 to 30 years older than my five teammates, I thought that I would not be able to accomplish as much as they did. Despite this, I remained dedicated, and focused every day on the advice to ""Keep moving forward!"" That powerful mantra, along with the love and support of my friends, family and co-workers, has given me a strength and confidence going into my 59th year that I never had before. I no longer use my age as an excuse, because it is anything but that. In fact, I have 11 months to set a new goal -- something I'll do on the day before my 59th birthday that seems impossible today!

"(CNN) -- Gene Barfield and his partner, Tim LaCroix, celebrated their 30th anniversary by getting married. The two met when they were both serving in the Navy, and last week, the military veterans became the first same-sex couple to be legally married by a tribe in Michigan. The pair exchanged vows on a cold but sunny morning at the government headquarters of the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians. LaCroix is a citizen of the LTBB, a federally recognized Native American tribe. Earlier this month, the LTBB tribal council voted to recognize same-sex unions as long as at least one member of the couple was a citizen of the tribe. LaCroix and Barfield were married the same morning that the tribal chairman signed the legislation into law. ""Gene had a heart attack last year, so we're aware that we need to do this now. We have less years in front of us than we do behind us,"" said LaCroix. ""Plus I just want to marry him. I love him,"" he added. The couple lives in Boyne City, Michigan, on a 30-acre farm that has been in LaCroix's family for generations. ""We didn't want to go to another state to get married. We always wanted to have the wedding here in the state of Michigan. It's our home,"" LaCroix said. The state of Michigan, however, says it will not recognize their marriage. ""The Michigan Constitution defines marriage as a union between one man and one woman. Same-sex marriages performed in other states, countries, or in sovereign tribal nations are not valid in the state of Michigan,"" said Joy Yearout, spokeswoman for Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette. Under U.S. policy, Native American tribes like the LTBB are self-governing and therefore able to make and enforce their own laws -- including ones governing marriage of tribal citizens. In 2004, Michigan approved a constitutional amendment legally defining marriage as being between a man and a woman. Thirty-seven other states have laws or amendments similarly defining marriage, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Barfield and LaCroix say they are optimistic the tide is shifting in favor of same-sex marriage. ""Marriage was inconceivable for me for such a long time, but now that has changed,"" Barfield said. Last year, for the first time, voters in several states approved same-sex marriage statewide at the ballot box. Similar measures had been rejected for years. Same-sex couples became free to marry in Maryland, Maine and Washington. Gay rights supporters also scored a smaller victory in Minnesota, where voters rejected a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. Before 2012, six states had already legalized gay marriage -- but via courts and legislatures, not voters. More Americans favor same-sex marriage than oppose it, according to a recent Pew Research Center poll. The LTBB is the third tribe to recognize same-sex marriages, after the Coquille Tribe of Oregon and the Suquamish Tribe of Washington. Getting married is not the end of the journey for LaCroix and Barfield. They would like their marriage and those of other gays and lesbians to be legally accepted in every state. The biggest hurdle the couple faces is the federal Defense of Marriage Act, known as DOMA. The 1996 law allows states to ignore the marriage laws of other states and it specifically exempts states from being forced to accept tribal same-sex marriages. The Supreme Court is expected to rule on a legal challenge to DOMA this term. Photos: The art of same-sex weddings . Barfield and LaCroix hope their union will be part of the ongoing legal and personal discussions about marriage rights for gays and lesbians. Barfield asks people to keep an open mind. ""We served our country to uphold those people's rights to protest our right to get married,"" he said. ""If you're good enough to bear arms for your country or to die in some lonely valley in Afghanistan, you're good enough to come home and get married."" Barfield and LaCroix said they are thrilled to finally be able to express their love in marriage, and they are mindful that their simple ceremony could hold meaning for other gays and lesbians. ""After waiting 30 years, we had patience and it finally happened. And you want to help people who are also in that struggle,"" LaCroix said. Watch CNN Newsroom weekdays 9am to 3pm ET and weekends.

"(CNN) -- Michael Boatwright got off the flight from Los Angeles to Sweden and tightly embraced an unfamiliar woman as if they were old friends. They were. The two had dated briefly in the 1980s. But Boatwright doesn't remember any of that. The 61-year-old Florida-born U.S. Navy vet woke up in a California hospital earlier this year speaking only Swedish. He had lived in Sweden off and on for about 20 years. Now, here he was at Goteborg Landvetter Airport, where that old friend, Ewa Espling, plans to help him get himself together in her country. ""I just want to be able to live a normal life and hopefully get my memory back,"" Boatwright said Tuesday. Boatwright has been diagnosed with dissociative amnesia, a rare psychiatric condition typically associated with a traumatic event. He says he has no memory of his past. Police found him unconscious in a Southern California Motel 6 in February. Navy vet wakes up, speaks only Swedish . Tuesday, Boatwright recalled that, waking up in the hospital this year, he looked at himself in the mirror and started crying. He didn't recognize the face looking back. When doctors tried to talk to him, he thought that his name was Johan Ek and that he was from Sweden. He didn't know why he had five tennis rackets in his hotel room. He was treated at Desert Regional Medical Center in Palm Springs. The hospital discharged him to Roy's Desert Resource Center, where he has spent the past two weeks. The Riverside County Department of Mental Health bought him a one-way ticket to Gothenburg after Boatwright made it clear that he wants to live in Sweden. Boatwright said Tuesday that he is grateful for all of the help he has received. In the United States, Boatwright said, he felt like a stranger in his own country because he didn't speak the language: English. In Sweden, he feels safe and more calm and believes he'll be able to start rebuilding his life. ""I think it's the best solution for Michael, because he can't speak English,"" Espling said. ""To recover fully, I think he needs to come where he's safe and understands what's happening around him."" Before Tuesday, Espling and Boatwright hadn't seen each other since 1984. Espling has arranged for a place for Boatwright to live in Sweden. She said she will try to assist as much as she can while he works through rebuilding his life. ""He's going to have a home as long as he needs it,"" she said. She identified Boatwright in a Swedish newspaper article this year. ""Michael asked me, 'Why are you doing this for me?' Because I know Michael would have done the same thing for me. If he had found me in the papers. This is a very nice man with a very big heart,"" Espling said. In an exclusive CNN interview this month, Boatwright said he suffers from recurring nightmares too disturbing to describe. Boatwright said he is pleased to be in Sweden and wants to start working once he gets his memory back. He hopes to become a tennis instructor because, in his view, it's the one thing he's good at. Boatwright compared his life to an empty chalkboard. ""After death, this is probably the worst thing you could ever go through,"" he said. Small pieces are starting to come back, however. Recently, a Swedish song called ""Sol, vind och vatten"" (""Sun, Wind and Water"") popped into his head as if it were on repeat all day long. He had no idea where it came from. He doesn't recall any experiences that he and Espling shared in the 1980s, but some emotional remnants of the past remain. Asked how he feels about Espling, he said, ""I feel warm on the inside.""

"(CNN) -- It's been a summer where you could not escape the matter of race if you tried. From the verdict in the shooting death of unarmed teen Trayvon Martin, to lifestyle maven Paula Deen being accused of using the ""N word"" and the Supreme Court's overturning a portion of the Voting Rights Act, conversations about race have dominated the headlines. At the same time, Hollywood has had the fortuitous timing of releasing two films that appear to reach into America's psyche right now and wring out all of the unease, anger and pain that can accompany conversations about race. ""Fruitvale Station"" and ""Lee Daniels' The Butler"" contain similar themes about the historical treatment of African-American men in the United States. ""Fruitvale Station"" is based on the real life case of Oscar Grant III, a 22-year-old Oakland resident who was detained by members of the Bay Area Rapid Transit Police Department and ultimately shot to death on New Year's Day 2009. Likewise, ""The Butler"" is based on the true story of a black man who served as a butler in the White House through several presidential administrations including during the civil rights era. Not only do both films tackle issues of civil rights, but they also share a Hollywood connection: Forest Whitaker stars as the main character, Cecil Gaines, in ""The Butler"" and is an executive producer of ""Fruitvale Station."" Whitaker spoke to the Wall Street Journal about the two movies' similarities. ""We have to recognize, in 'The Butler,' in 'Fruitvale,' people (are) standing up and trying to say things,"" Whitaker said. ""We're in a living history. ... I believe we're at that moment of a tipping point, where we're saying, we are in this together and any injustice done to you, as Mother Teresa would say, is one done to me. If I can't see my face inside of you, then I truly don't see the whole of who I am."" The success of ""The Butler"" -- which was No. 1 at the box office, taking in $25 million for its opening weekend -- could be viewed as surprising given outcries over films like 2011's ""The Help,"" which also featured black characters in roles of servitude. Oprah Winfrey, who stars as Whitaker's wife in ""The Butler,"" acknowledged possible backlash. ""My mother was a maid. My grandmother was a maid. Her mother was a maid,"" Winfrey told Parade Magazine. ""To look down upon that part of my history would be ridiculous. I am the seed of that,"" she said. ""So for me, ('The Butler') is a story about family and connection, living through those times. I hope people come away from it with a sense of pride and gratitude for that generation, because none of us would be here without the butlers and maids. None of us."" In a CNN story titled ""Is 'The Help' heroic or stereotyping?"" published in 2011, ""The Help"" star Octavia Spencer -- who also stars in ""Fruitvale Station"" -- defended the film that eventually won her an Academy Award for best supporting actress. ""This is one of the first times that I've seen domestics or people of lower means from that era have a voice and the story has been told from their perspective,"" Spencer said. ""I've never read something where we weren't just plot points and our characters had lives outside of the kitchen."" Prior to the opening of ""The Butler,"" CNN asked director Lee Daniels if he had concerns about black moviegoers not supporting his film. Daniels said he looked very close to home to gauge what the response might be. ""My family's rough on me,"" he said. ""I have a 91-year-old uncle. He was the first pediatric surgeon of color in America and when he saw this movie, I can't explain to you what it was like. He cried from the beginning to the end, and he laughed from beginning to end."" Daniels believed his 16-year-old son might have issues with the film, but instead he gave it a thumbs up. ""He told me that this was the greatest achievement that I had done."" Scenes from 'The Butler' premiere . In a conversation with AOL, Winfrey also acknowledged the challenge of getting movie goers to turn out for such heavy fare. ""I know it's hard to get audiences of all races and backgrounds out to see a movie, particularly what it takes to just go out to a film ... because race makes people uncomfortable,"" Winfrey said. ""For me (the film is) a drama, it's history and it's also a great love story about family."" Since ""The Butler"" opened, the film has stirred high emotions for reasons beyond its on-screen themes. CNN affiliate WJLA reported that there was concern after a couple took to Twitter to announce that a showing of ""The Butler"" in Washington had a large amount of security. Alan Hanson and Tiffany Flowers questioned whether the audience was being racially profiled. ""They must have thought this was going to be a particularly rowdy crowd,"" Flowers told WJLA. ""I've traveled the world; been to a lot of movie theaters. This is the first time I've ever seen anything like this."" Regal Entertainment Group, which owns the theater, issued a statement denying that ""The Butler"" had been targeted for any special treatment. ""Regal Entertainment Group routinely employs security personnel to ensure the safety of all of our guests and staff,"" the statement said. ""When a theatre experiences sold-out showings of any feature, security will assist with crowd control and guest assistance throughout the facility, including auditoriums.""","Like this summer's ""Fruitvale Station,"" ""The Butler"" reflects current conversation .

"(CNN) -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai has called a high-level judiciary meeting to discuss the case of a rape victim who was jailed because of the attack and has agreed to marry the rapist to get out of prison and legitimize her daughter, the president's spokesman said Monday. The meeting, scheduled for Thursday in Kabul, was called in reaction to a petition with nearly 5,000 signatures and media inquiries about the case, said Karzai spokesman Aimal Faizi. The woman was sentenced to 12 years in prison after she approached authorities to report that her cousin's husband had raped her two years ago. CNN is identifying her only as Gulnaz to protect her identity. She did not immediately report the attack, fearing reprisals from elements of Afghanistan's conservative society and was sentenced to prison for adultery because her attacker was married at the time. Her sentence was later reduced to three years. A spokesman for the attorney general, Rahmatullah Naziri, told CNN last week that while the original sentence for adultery was reduced, she had failed to report her rape quickly enough and would have to serve further time in jail for that offense. She is now raising her daughter in jail and has agreed to marry her attacker in order to be released and legitimize her daughter. She also fears attack from her rapist's relatives, something he denies is a risk. Kim Motley, a lawyer for 21-year-old Gulnaz, said the petition gathered 4,751 names in about 48 hours. The palace received the petition on Sunday, she said. It comes with an official plea for clemency addressed to the president, who has the power to immediately pardon Gulnaz. Her plight gained international attention when the European Union blocked the broadcast of a documentary made about her ordeal saying that it would further jeopardize her safety. The U.S. State Department, while not explicitly calling for Gulnaz's release, said Thursday that ""Gulnaz's situation is one no woman should have to face"" and called on prosecutors to uphold the law and Gulnaz's rights.","Afghanistan's president calls high-level judiciary meeting to discuss rape victim's case .

"(CNN) -- Police arrested a former Creighton University medical resident Monday for two double homicides over five years, both sets of victims were connected to the pathology department at the Nebraska school. Anthony Joseph Garcia, 40, was arrested during a traffic stop in Illinois, Omaha Police Chief Todd Schmaderer said. Officers were making preparations to arrest him Tuesday, but the Indiana resident ""became mobile"" and police felt they needed to arrest him right away, he said. Garcia was arrested on four counts of first-degree murder in the May deaths of Roger and Mary Brumback, both 65, and the March 2008 deaths of 11-year-old Thomas Hunter and his family's housekeeper, Shirlee Sherman. All lived in Omaha. Roger Brumback was a professor in the pathology and neurology departments at Creighton and announced his retirement shortly before he was killed. Thomas Hunter's father, Dr. William Hunter, is a faculty member in Creighton's 12-person pathology department. The boy's mother, Dr. Claire Hunter, is an associate professor in Creighton's cardiology division. Garcia was a resident who worked in the pathology lab from July 2000 until June 2001, when the Brumbacks and William Hunter fired him, the university said. Neither police nor the university said why Garcia was terminated, but CNN affiliate KETV said it was because of ""erratic behavior."" An Omaha task force had been monitoring Garcia ""for some time,"" Schmaderer said. He was pulled over for suspected alcohol impairment and was found with a .45 handgun. Authorities believe Garcia acted alone, Schmaderer said. It's not clear where Garcia was working at the time of his arrest. ""Creighton University and particularly the School of Medicine and Department of Pathology are grateful for the work of the Omaha Police Department and the special task force in these investigations,"" the school said in a statement late Monday. CNN's Dave Stewart contributed to this report.","Anthony Joseph Garcia worked at the Creighton University pathology lab .

"(CNN)  -- What was the best moment of Willow Brugh's weekend? ""Someone stood up on a chair (and) asked if anyone had Arduino skills,"" she said, in reference to the programming platform. ""And someone jogged over to them with a huge grin on their face. The joy of sharing."" It wasn't a traditional weekend, of course. Brugh was one of the planners of the Seattle Random Hacks of Kindness event, one of about a dozen such ""hackathons"" held last weekend around the world. About 1,500 self-proclaimed hackers and technology enthusiasts attended. It was a weekend of synthesis brought about by what Toronto organizer Heather Leson called ""brains colliding."" The RHoK events bring together disaster relief and climate change organizations and a variety of programmers and developers to see if they can generate new solutions to old problems -- in the space of a single weekend. The Random Hacks of Kindness umbrella organization was founded in 2009 by Google, Yahoo!, the World Bank, NASA, and Microsoft. This weekend was its third international event, and saw teams competing locally in places as far-flung as Bangalore, India and Buenos Aires, Argentina. World Bank Digital Strategist and RHoK Nairobi organizer Will Pate was proud to point out that almost every single person at RHoK Nairobi stayed the whole 36 hours, eating and sleeping at the hackathon, to get their projects done. ""What was really exciting was seeing a group of young people who are very talented just dive right in and be so dedicated that they stayed overnight."" You might not think even the smartest computer wizards could build much in just a day or two. But you'd be wrong. RHoK events often end with fully functional products. And the products they create are as diverse as the teams that made them. In Sao Paolo, Brazil, the main focus was on tools relating to flooding and landslides. Organizer and World Bank Disaster Risk Consultant Aires Zulian Nunes da Conceicao said the top prize-winning hacks there both dealt with new, inexpensive ways to track and understand rainfall and to educate Brazilians about disaster risk. At the end of the conference, a new kind of synthesis was already occurring. ""We had nine problems with solutions in Sao Paolo, and after the event, the groups were coordinating a collaboration, putting all those solutions together into one package of software,"" he said. ""Hacks to identify risks, in the event to find survivors and use social media to connect them, and then to fix things and manage costs post-event."" In Nairobi, the RHoK weekend started out with a presentation about challenges faced by the Kenya Red Cross. One new solution would help the Red Cross manage volunteers, from their names and skills to keeping track of the hours they've worked so they don't overexert themselves. Another focused on HIV/AIDS and people taking anti-retroviral drugs. These people are of particular concern in disaster situations because they have to take their medication at precise intervals. A new RHoK application could help coordinate efforts to prevent an interruption of that schedule. Interestingly, two versions of the same hack won the Atlanta, Georgia, and Toronto, Canada, RHoK events. MessageCarrier will take messages from people isolated in a disaster and keep them until it finds a data connection. Atlanta participant Blake Byrnes explains how this works: . ""A relief worker goes into a devastated area where cell towers are wiped out and allows people to input messages into their phone. Once they return to an area that has connectivity, it will send all the messages for those people. Kind of like collecting letter mail for people."" One Seattle team designed a ""Tethered Tower,"" a fire- and weather-monitoring sensor that can be mounted on buildings in urban areas or float on weather balloons for emergencies. Willow Brugh says Tethered Tower hack was her favorite ""because it was hardware hacking at a type of event which is usually software only."" The Tethered Tower could also be used as an emergency Wi-Fi hotspot in case of the general loss of Internet connectivity. Although the stated mission of RHoK#3 addressed disaster and climate issues, not all of the solutions presented followed this guideline. Four different hacks attempted to connect food providers (like caterers with leftover lasagna) with local food banks to avoid waste. A Philadelphia team developed an already-functional application to allow local shoppers to find retailers participating in the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. One Seattle team created an application to educate individuals about environmental hazards. It would combine a variety of data sources and tell its user about the water and air quality, among other factors, in their specific current location, and also identify the specific legislator who should be contacted with complaints. In a true nod to geekdom, its current name is ""Eco-Tricorder."" Some of the solutions at RHoK herald a new direction for the organization. This weekend, RHoK announced that it will broaden its mission statement to include all challenges of global development, including water issues. Elizabeth Sabet of Second Muse, RHoK's global operational lead, explained by e-mail: ""The first will be the WaterHackathon in October, where hackers are going to take on the world's single largest cause of illness: lack of safe water and inadequate sanitation."" So hackers, fire up your engines. But those who might not label themselves hackers are welcome too. Everybody has a useful skill, according to Will Pate: . ""Anyone who's got any skill, RHoK is not closed to you. It's a way to figure out how you can use what you've got to serve development.""","One dozen Random Hacks of Kindness events held around the world .

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- As much of the country deals with heat waves, the temperature in this coastal city rarely exceeds 75 degrees. Don't you want to be in San Diego? Really? You might want to re-think that. It's not a good time. The circus came to town several weeks ago, and now it refuses to leave. One of America's finest cities is being held hostage. What are we supposed to do? Call the mayor? That won't do any good. He's the one holding us hostage. Bob Filner, national punchline and catnip for late-night talk show hosts, has been accused of sexual harassment, inappropriate touching, lewd comments and other boorish behavior by -- at last count -- 17 women. One woman who accused him of making inappropriate comments -- apparently about his sexual stamina -- was a 67-year-old great-grandmother. I had snarkily predicted that we'd get to 20 women by Labor Day. Now, the way it's been going, we could hit that figure by the end of business today. Opinion: No room for lecherous mayors . The 70-year-old is no longer just a weirdo with what he admits is a problem (he recently underwent what we are assured was intensive behavioral therapy). In recent days, it's been revealed that he's a first-class narcissist who wants to lead this city so badly that it is of little concern to him that very few people still want to follow. Forget that, like most politicians, he rode into office on assurances that he was doing it all to help the less fortunate. Now we know the truth: It's all about Bob. Most of his supporters have deserted him. A new poll shows about 80% of San Diegans want him to resign. A recall effort has begun with volunteers hoping to collect more than 100,000 signatures by September 26. And all the while, Mayor Naughty fiddles. Filner isn't exactly cleaning out his office. He doesn't seem to care what anyone thinks about him. He won't leave, and it might just be that -- even with all the pressure being applied -- we can't make him leave. Even if Filner is recalled, he's likely to challenge the legality of the action. After all, he could argue, he's innocent until proven guilty. Where is his due process? Don't be surprised if some Republicans start saying the same thing. They'd like to drag this sordid affair out as long as possible. Since the beginning of this soap opera by the sea, the loudest voices clamoring for Filner to leave have belonged to his fellow Democrats. They know what's at stake. San Diego County is a red county that is turning purple as the number of Democrats grows, thanks to changing demographics. Filner could drag his party down with him, and send the county back into the Republican column for another generation. Mayor Filner's accusers . Even the Democratic National Committee is ratcheting up pressure on the mayor with a vote on a resolution planned this week calling on him to resign. How embarrassing are the Filner follies? Try this on for size: Hooters restaurants in San Diego have banned the mayor because, according to the management, Filner doesn't respect women. What do you do when you're deemed morally deficient by a restaurant chain that made a fortune off the concept of waitresses serving up hot wings in tight shorts and cleavage-baring T-shirts? In Filner's case, you go on with business as usual. You ignore calls to step down, from the entire San Diego City Council and a host of elected officials, including Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer of California. This week, the mayor ducked into a downtown office building for settlement talks with Irene McCormack Jackson, his former communications director, and her lawyer Gloria Allred. McCormack Jackson, who was the first woman to publicly accuse Filner of wrongdoing, has filed a lawsuit claiming the mayor told her to work without panties, tried to kiss her, told her he wanted to see her naked and put her in a headlock. One of the issues still unresolved is just who would pay a settlement if one were reached -- Filner or the city? City officials have made it clear they aren't eager to foot the bill for Filner's alleged misbehavior, but they seem to be keeping that door open if it will help get the embattled mayor into an early retirement. Filner does still have a few supporters. This week, several dozen of them staged a protest to try to dissuade people from signing the recall petitions. One activist took to the microphone to denounce the ""witchcraft, uh, witchhunt"" going after Filner, who she insisted was a good man and a champion for the downtrodden. ""He was a Freedom Rider,"" she said. ""He fought for immigration. He is far more than sloppy kisses."" Out of rehab, but locked out of office . And that's a defender? Have mercy on the hostages. Great weather notwithstanding, at the moment, it's hard to imagine that any city in America is more uncomfortable than this one.

"(CNN) -- Country singer Billy Currington is a wanted man, indicted on charges of making terroristic threats and the abuse of an elderly person by a Georgia grand jury. The indictment accused Currington, 39, of threatening bodily harm against Charles Harvey Ferrelle in Tybee Island, Georgia, on April 15. The elder abuse charge was included because Farrell is older than 65, the indictment said. A Savannah judge issued a bench warrant for Currington's arrest after the indictment was handed up by a Chatham County grand jury that ""found sufficient evidence"" against him, District Attorney Meg Heap said Wednesday. The prosecutor did not give any other details about the allegations. Currington and his representatives did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment, although the singer did post a message to fans through his Twitter account: ""hey guys, I wanted to thank everyone for the huge amount of support that I have received already. Unfortunately, I can't comment on this situation as this is an ongoing legal matter. It means a lot to me to have your support during this time."" While it is unclear if there is a connection, Currington tweeted this two days after the alleged incident: ""harrassing artists often at their home by boat should be illegal. thas all i know."" Although Currington mostly lives in Nashville, he is a native of Rincon, Georgia, which is about 35 miles inland from Tybee Island. Currington's hit country songs include ""Must Be Doin' Somethin' Right,"" ""Good Directions,"" ""People Are Crazy,"" ""That's How Country Boys Roll,"" ""Pretty Good at Drinkin' Beer,"" and ""Let Me Down Easy.""

"New York (CNN) -- A New Jersey teenager was killed when his head hit a highway overpass after he apparently stuck it out of a party bus near the George Washington Bridge, which connects Manhattan with New Jersey over the Hudson River. Daniel Fernandez, a 16-year-old resident of Sayreville, died Friday evening on his way to a sweet 16 party, according to Port Authority spokesman Steve Coleman. He was on the top level of a double-decker bus when he apparently stuck his head out of an emergency hatch in the roof, Coleman said. His head then struck the underside of an overpass, he said. The incident occurred after the New Jersey-bound bus departed Queens, New York -- loaded with 65 teenagers -- and had just crossed the George Washington Bridge. Off-duty emergency medical technician Leon Tyrone McKivor, 52, said he approached the scene to offer his assistance and escorted worried parents to a nearby police station where their children were waiting. ""One individual had on a blood soaked shirt that he refused to take off until police insisted that he change,"" McKivor told CNN. ""A number of other individuals had blood all over them, as well."" McKivor said he tried to console the mother of one of the girls who was on the bus. ""She was just crying and crying and hugging me and thanking me,"" he said. The horrific scene left several party-goers stunned, according to multiple posts on social media. ""Sitting here with your blood on my foot wishing this was all a bad dream,"" tweeted teenage party-goer Vicky Budz. ""Can't sleep with you on my mind cause the more time goes on the more its settling in."" News of the incident spread quickly via the microblogging site Twitter, with over 500 tweets to the #staystrongdan hashtag within a few hours of the accident. Fernandez was brought to Hackensack Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead, said hospital spokeswoman Nancy Radwin. Coleman said the teen had suffered severe head trauma, but would not comment further. The bus is touted online as ""the largest custom made party bus in the country,"" according to Designer Transportation, which released a statement expressing sympathy for the teen's family. ""Our company cares about the well being of our patrons,"" the statement said. Company spokesman Todd Shapiro said there was no alcohol aboard and that security had checked passengers beforehand. CNN's Dominique Debucquoy-Dodley and Andrea Morocoima contributed to this report.","NEW: Bus company spokesman says there was no alcohol aboard .

"(CNN) -- He may be the King of Miami, but should LeBron James be treated like a head of state? That's the question some are asking after the basketball superstar was given a police escort Sunday night to the Jay Z and Justin Timberlake concert at Miami's Sun Life Stadium.

""The stadium got a phone call that LeBron James was stuck in traffic, so the stadium personnel got hold of one of our police supervisors working the event,"" Zabaleta said. ""He (asked) if there is any way we can get him out of traffic and get him to the concert."" Zabaleta said an officer agreed to ""take care of it."" ""It wasn't hard to spot LeBron,"" Zabaleta said, ""and what the officer did was he told the officers working the traffic detail to stop traffic, hold the traffic and then he chose to go northbound on the southbound lanes. It took him less than a mile. He turned right and went onto the stadium property. ""That's all the officer did, but LeBron went ahead and recorded it and said he was getting a police escort and going against traffic."" The entire escort covered just eight blocks, Zabaleta told CNN. ""From one intersection to another,"" was how he put it. But he also said department policy was violated. ""We don't have our units ever go against traffic,"" he said. ""The officer shouldn't have done that. But he didn't flagrantly say, 'I'm not going to worry about it'. He did stop traffic for eight blocks. And that was the end of it."" Zabaleta said department supervisors ""are looking into the incident, and they are assessing the whole situation. But he wasn't playing Frogger the whole way,"" referring to a video game in which a frog tries to make it across a road amid busy traffic. As for LeBron James, the detective only had praise.

The tourism sector is the number one export earner for Egypt, and made up 11% of GDP in 2012. One well-known hotel owner in Sharm el Sheikh, who spoke on background, said tourism receipts were down 25% at his resort in the first half as high end visitors avoided the Red Sea. Those who kept their plans intact are spending less, he said. If tourism is the big foreign exchange earner, then foreign investment has been a pillar of long term job creation by leading multi-national brands. Read more: Egypt explained .

"(CNN) -- I took care of AIDS patients from 1981 to 1998 in a county clinic in Atlanta. By the time they showed up at the door, many of them had advanced disease. Most died within two years. Before they died, they suffered from untold painful physical conditions in addition to the unique brand of pain caused by the the pervasive social stigma of AIDS. Without effective treatment of HIV, a physician couldn't offer much more than supportive care. Then, in 1995, a ""cocktail"" of three anti-retroviral drugs proved to be successful in fighting the virus -- not completely killing it, but reducing its numbers so its devastation of the immune system was minimized. The treatment worked like a miracle. Patients got better and very quickly. Seeing the transformation of patients from close to death's door to living healthy lives was one of the most rewarding experiences I've had as a physician. But the patients aren't cured. They must take drugs for their lifetime. Neither a cure for HIV nor a vaccine to prevent HIV has yet been developed. Now, an HIV-infected baby who was treated with a combination of drugs from birth to 18 months and then not treated for a year was found to be free of HIV infection at 30 months. The child is considered cured. This is the second reported HIV cure in history and the first in a child, and it is rightly making international news. We can all share the joy of a child cured and hope the treatment will bring a better life for infected babies in the future. Kudos to the clinician, Dr. Hannah B. Gay, whose expertise, instincts and treatment of the infant led to this remarkable outcome. But there was another great advance against the HIV virus that did not make big headlines. A simple treatment with anti-retroviral drugs can prevent babies from being infected by their HIV positive mothers in the first place. Of course, a patient cure is much more visible than an infection prevented. Maybe that is why we celebrate cure in a way that we do not celebrate prevention. Toddler's HIV cure offers global hope . Until the mid-1990s, pregnant women with HIV infection had a 30% chance of transmitting the infection to their newborn. A landmark study showed that treating HIV-positive pregnant women during their labor and delivery with intravenous zidovudine, or AZT, and then giving the infant AZT syrup orally for four to six weeks reduced the risk of HIV transmission to less than 2%. Successful prevention means the baby is free of HIV infection and will no longer need treatment. We should also celebrate those babies who were not infected with HIV by virtue of treatment of mother and newborn with this drug regimen. Kudos to the thousands of clinicians who have treated HIV-infected pregnant mothers and their offspring. How do we know the treatment was effective? We know only by the data meticulously collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Protection since AIDS was first recognized in 1981. HIV transmission from mother to child during pregnancy, labor and delivery or breastfeeding is known as perinatal transmission. In 2012, the CDC reported that the combined mother/infant HIV treatment regimen resulted in a decline of perinatal transmission by more than 90% since the beginning of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. AIDS in the '90s: 'I wasn't going to die miserably' This incredible reduction was accomplished despite the fact that more women with HIV infection were giving birth. How far we have come. Women with health care do not have a problem being tested for HIV. The problem lies with women who don't have health care and have not been tested. In 2005, the CDC recommended that if a women arrives in labor in the emergency room and has not had prenatal care, a rapid, 20-minute test for HIV should be done so preventive treatment can be started immediately. Despite the existence of this treatment, babies are still born infected with HIV in the United States and worldwide. Prevention strategies are rarely perfect. That is why we need to have a Plan B for babies with HIV infection -- and the findings of Gay and her colleagues might be just that. The potential impact of this discovery will be far greater in developing countries -- especially in Africa, where thousands of HIV-infected babies are born each year. Of course, what we desperately need to control HIV is a safe and effective vaccine for both infants and adults. Until then, let us celebrate each success. Each one gives hope that we will eventually conquer one of the most formidable of viruses.

"(CNN) -- An attempted breakout by Muslim Brotherhood prisoners left at least 36 dead Sunday as Egypt's military chief urged supporters of ousted President Mohamed Morsy to quit resisting the new government. ""Egypt has room for everybody, and we are keen to save every drop of Egyptian blood,"" Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the country's defense minister, said after days of clashes between pro-Morsy demonstrators and security forces that left hundreds dead. But he added, ""Confrontation will not be in the interest of those who wish to confront us, because we are determined to protect Egypt and its people."" New protests against the military-installed interim government popped up around the country after Sunday evening prayers. And at least three dozen jailed members of the Muslim Brotherhood, the long-supressed Islamist movement that brought Morsy to power, were killed during what the Interior Ministry said was an attempted breakout. The inmates were among a group of more than 600 who were being taken to a prison north of Cairo, ministry spokesman Hani Abdel Latif told CNN. They seized a senior officer who was checking out ""a commotion"" in one of the trucks, he said. ""The other officers tried to free him, and in the process, they used tear gas, resulting in 36 detainees killed,"" Abdel Latif said. The captive officer was seriously injured but survived, the ministry said. The Freedom and Justice Party, the Brotherhood's political arm, put the number of dead at 52 and demanded an international investigation into the deaths. Al-Sisi and Interior Minister Mohammed Ibrahim Kamel bear ""full criminal responsibility"" for the deaths, the party said. An earlier report by the state-run news agency EGYNews said a group of armed men attempted to free the prisoners. Abdel Latif said that report was still being investigated, however. Morsy was toppled in July, triggering weeks of protests by the Muslim Brotherhood and his supporters. The ouster capped weeks of growing protests against Egypt's first democratically elected leader, who had taken office barely a year before. In a nationally televised speech, al-Sisi urged Morsy's supporters ""to review their national positions and realize very well that the legitimacy belongs to the people."" ""The Egyptian people are free to choose whoever to govern them, while the armed forces will remain the safeguard of the will of the people and of their choice,"" he said. Morsy's supporters say the military-backed interim government instigated the violence that killed more than 700 in the past week, starting with a dawn raid at two pro-Morsy protest camps last week that left more than 500 dead. Scores more were killed in the following days as Morsy's supporters tried to continue their protests. Among the dead were 70 police officers, with more than 600 police, soldiers and other members of the security forces wounded, the Interior Ministry reported Sunday. The government also announced a ban against ""popular committees,"" the neighborhood watch groups that have battled protesters in recent days. The Interior Ministry said Sunday evening that some of those groups were taking advantage of their positions to carry out ""criminal acts."" But Muslim Brotherhood spokesman Mahmoud Ghazlan said al-Sisi's comments ""are a clear proof that the end of the coup is near,"" Ghazlan said. Al-Sisi and other government leaders were ""trying to beautify the ugly face of this bloody coup,"" he said. ""Woe unto those who will be fooled by all of these lies."" The Brotherhood canceled a march planned for Roxy Square in Heliopolis, a suburb of Cairo, due to concerns about snipers on routes. But it said demonstrations took place around the country, including in Alexandria, on the Mediterranean coast, and in Giza, outside Cairo. In Qena, in southern Egypt, demonstrators chanted, ""We are all ready to be martyrs"" and ""Down, down with the killers."" In Atfih, south of Cairo, protesters called al-Sisi a ""butcher"" and called for his execution. The size of the protests could not be independently confirmed. On Saturday, Egyptian security forces arrested more than 350 people at a mosque where throngs of Morsy supporters were hiding, including a handful from outside Egypt -- three Irish citizens, one Turkish and one Syrian, the Egyptian Interior Ministry said. The ministry also said two automatic rifles and 24 Molotov cocktail bottles were confiscated. Among others in custody was Mohamed al-Zawahiri, the brother of al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, an Egyptian court confirmed Sunday. Mohamed al-Zawahiri and another Islamist leader, Mustafa Hamza, were ordered held for up to 15 days for investigation on charges of joining an organization that seeks to disrupt the social peace and national unity in the country, the state-run news service EGYNews reported. Both men are leaders of another Islamist organization, Jamaa Islamiya. Government says news biased toward Morsy, Islamists . Morsy's opponents argued the army needed to step in to protect Egypt's nascent democracy from a leader who was amassing power for himself. The new government urged the global community to listen to its side Sunday, accusing international media of being sympathetic to Morsy and the Muslim Brotherhood. In a statement also released Sunday, the interim government said it would set up a National Council for Human Rights and document ""all the events that took place during the crisis."" But it also said it would set up a National Committee for Media and questioned whether the Qatar-based satellite network Al Jazeera was operating legally inside Egypt. And members of the Foreign Ministry showed journalists a video-and-photo montage Sunday of recent carnage, blaming ""terrorists"" for the chaos. Foreign Minister Nabil Fahmy acknowledged the country is in a state of uncertainty. He said the interim government is ""trying to identify the political identity so we can move forward."" ""We are still open to any ideas or suggestions"" from the global community, Fahmy told reporters Sunday. But in the end, ""the decision is Egyptian."" Fahmy also said he greatly appreciated the foreign aid that Egypt gets. The United States, for example, gives Egypt more than $1 billion a year. ""We are very thankful for the aid. But it should not be targeted,"" Fahmy said. ""The threat of stopping aid in this period is not acceptable."" Opinion: Why U.S. hasn't cut off aid to Egypt . But the Obama administration is facing new calls from U.S. lawmakers to cut off that aid in the wake of last week's violence. U.S. law bars support of a government that has taken power by extraconstitutional means, but the administration has said it won't make a formal determination as to whether Morsy's ouster was a coup. Sen. Jack Reed, a leading Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that the the clampdown is ""completely unconscionable."" And Sen. John McCain, the committee's ranking Republican, said continued American assistance will add fuel to anti-American sentiments in the region. ""With Apache helicopters flying overhead, nothing is more symbolic of the United States of America siding with the generals,"" McCain told CNN's ""State of the Union."" Other allies in the region have stepped up to support the current government. Saudi Arabia has pledged $5 billion in grants and loans, while the United Arab Emirates has said it would give $1 billion to Egypt and lend it an additional $2 billion as an interest-free central bank deposit. ElBaradei takes off . Amid the turmoil, Cairo's stock market plunged nearly 4% on Sunday. And Mohamed ElBaradei, who stepped down last week as interim vice president, boarded a flight to Austria, after the interim president accepted his resignation, EGYNews service reported. The former International Atomic Energy Agency chief was one of Morsy's biggest critics. But ElBaradei said in his resignation Wednesday that he didn't agree with decisions carried out by the ruling government and ""cannot be responsible for a single (drop of) blood."" Egypt: Is it still safe to travel? Meanwhile, the turmoil in Egypt continues to cause ripples overseas. Members of the European Union announced Sunday that the body will ""urgently review in the coming days its relations with Egypt and adopt measures"" aimed at ending violence, resuming political dialogue and returning to a democratic process.

"(CNN) -- So used to being the only British man in the second round at grand slams -- especially outside Wimbledon -- Andy Murray will have company at the U.S. Open. Although Murray didn't play his first-round match against Michael Llodra on Monday, the defending champion is fully expected to defeat the French veteran. And if he indeed gets to the round of 64, he will find qualifier Dan Evans alongside him. Evans became the first men's player outside the top 150 in the world rankings to defeat a top-15 rival at the U.S. Open in six years when he dispatched Japan's Kei Nishikori. The 179th-ranked Evans didn't only beat Nishikori -- he won in straight sets 6-4 6-4 6-2. After Evans rallied from a break down in the first set, he cruised. ""When I saw the draw, it was a little bit daunting but I went out and I played a good game and he didn't react that well to how I was playing,"" Evans told Sky Sports. Once described as the bad boy of British tennis because he liked partying and didn't practice hard enough, Evans has seemingly turned his career around in recent months. The 23-year-old sent Britain into the Davis Cup world group playoffs when he crushed Russia's Evgeny Donskoy in April in the decisive fifth match. Murray decided to skip the series but is expected to feature when Britain faces Croatia in September with a spot in next year's world group at stake. With his performance in New York, Evans now has the edge over James Ward in being the No. 2 behind Murray in the tie. Ward failed to qualify for Flushing Meadows. Ahead of the U.S. Open, Evans reached challenger finals in Vancouver and California to see his ranking move from around 250 to his current 179. Qualifying and toppling Nishikori will see the diminutive shot-maker's ranking rise yet further. ""I've just been on the practice court a lot more and in the gym a lot more,"" Evans said. ""It's been a gradual process from January onwards and I'm reaping the rewards of it now."" Britain had another winner on day one of the season's last major, as Laura Robson overcame Lourdes Dominguez Lino 7-5 6-0. Robson was one of the young stars of the 2012 edition, sending crowd favorite Kim Clijsters into singles retirement and also upending Li Na. Her 2013, though, has been blighted by injuries and a coaching change. She has yet to register a quarterfinal showing at any event this campaign. Elsewhere, men's favorite Rafael Nadal eased past American Ryan Harrison in straight sets and Venus Williams maintained her record of never losing in the first round of the U.S. Open when she beat 12th-seeded Kirsten Flipkens 6-1 6-2. Nadal missed last year's U.S. Open due to knee troubles. ""For me, the chance to be back here playing -- I have a chance to compete this year -- is great,"" Nadal, unbeaten on hard courts this year, told reporters. Flipkens, the Wimbledon semifinalist, had gotten the better of Williams in Toronto this month in the 33-year-old American's comeback from a back injury. Blake to retire . Andy Roddick retired last year after the U.S. Open and Mardy Fish's days on the tennis tour might be numbered given his health issues. Now a third member of the U.S.'s older generation, James Blake -- like Williams 33 -- said Monday in an emotional news conference he would quit following the U.S. Open. ""Despite the tears, I'm actually really happy about this,"" Blake told reporters. Diagnosed with severe scoliosis as a teen and later breaking his neck in a practice accident, Blake persevered. He reached a career high of No. 4, has claimed 10 titles, won a Davis Cup and played at the prestigious year-end championships. His career, however, has been slowed by injuries in recent years and he became a father in 2012.","Daniel Evans pulls off a major upset on the opening day of tennis' U.S. Open .

"New York (CNN) -- The boyfriend of a swimsuit designer found dead in a bathtub at a chic New York hotel was convicted of her murder Thursday and faces up to 25 years in prison, the Manhattan District Attorney's office said. A jury convicted Nicholas Brooks, son of ""You Light Up My Life"" composer Joseph Brooks, in New York Supreme Court for strangling and drowning Sylvie Cachay in December 2010, the office said in a statement. ""Domestic violence victims all too frequently become homicide victims,"" District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said. ""Sylvie Cachay suffered a terrible death at the hands of a man who claimed to love her."" Cachay's bruised body was found submerged in water in an overflowing bathtub at the Soho House club and hotel on December 9, 2010, police said. A guest staying on a lower floor of the hotel reported to hotel management that water was leaking through the ceiling of that guest's room, according to court documents. A hotel employee investigating the source of the leak entered Cachay's room and discovered her body, the documents say. Her death was later ruled a homicide. Authorities said they relied on interviews with hotel employees and surveillance videos from the location to charge Brooks. Cachay's body had bruising on the neck and bite marks, police said. An autopsy indicated the designer suffered injuries consistent with neck compression, court records show. Cachay had internal hemorrhaging, injuries to her scalp and cuts to her lips and mouth, the documents say. Brooks is expected to be sentenced in court July 26 and could face up to 25 years to life in prison. Calls to his attorney, Jeffrey Hoffman, were not immediately returned Thursday. ""Sylvie Cachay was one of those rare individuals who truly sparkled when she spoke,"" said publicist Kate Godici. ""She will be deeply and painfully missed, yet celebrated, honored and never forgotten."" After heading the swimwear team at Victoria's Secret, Cachay debuted her own luxury line of swimwear in 2006 to rave reviews. The collection became a celebrity favorite. Brooks' father, Joseph Brooks, 73, committed suicide in May 2011, New York police said. The Oscar-winning songwriter was facing 11 rape and sexual assault charges, New York Police Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne told CNN.","Nicholas Brooks is convicted of killing Sylvie Cachay in December 2010 .

"(CNN) -- One suspect has been arrested in connection to a pair of car bombings that killed at least 45 people in northern Lebanon, the state-run National News Agency reported. Shiekh Ahmed al-Ghareeb was seen on surveillance camera in Al-Salam mosque in the site of the explosion. Security forces raided his home in Al-Minye and seized some military machine guns and some grenades, according to the news agency. The blasts Friday in Tripoli occurred near mosques run by Sunni imams with ties to Syrian rebels. While some Lebanese Sunnis have gone to neighboring Syria to fight alongside those trying to unseat President Bashar al-Assad's government, Shiites from Lebanon's Hezbollah group are fighting in support of the embattled leader. Even before authorities had given indications as to who was behind the bombing, members of the Lebanese parliament from Tripoli issued a statement Friday night blaming ""treacherous hands that strive to import the regional blaze into Lebanon,"" NNA reported. The legislators also called on Tripoli residents to show restraint and cooperate with security officials. In addition to the deaths, at least 500 people were reported injured in the blasts, which the National News Agency reported. The first one occurred near the Sunni al Taqwa mosque and the second was, minutes later, near al Salam mosque. This latter explosion was close to the residences of acting Prime Minister Najib Mikati and Ashraf Rifi, the former head of the country's Internal Security Forces. Rifi is widely despised by Hezbollah and Lebanese politicians friendly to al-Assad, the Syrian president. This bomb produced a crater 5 meters (16.4 feet) across, incinerated more than 60 cars and damaged six residential buildings, the news agency said. Mikati issued a statement via Twitter condemning the bombings. ""We urge our children and brothers in Tripoli to practice self-restraint, and we pledge to them that we will always stand by them, especially during these critical times,"" he said. Tammam Salam, the man designated to become Lebanon's next prime minister, cut short a private trip to Greece after the blasts. ""The crime of Tripoli is further evidence that the situation in Lebanon reached a very critical stage and requires us to be on high alert on the political, national and security levels in order to eradicate the internal strife,"" he said. Hezbollah said, in its own statement, that the explosions were part of a ""criminal scheme aimed at sowing seeds of strife among the Lebanese."" A car bombing in a southern suburb of Beirut earlier this month rocked a Hezbollah stronghold, killing at least 22 people and injuring hundreds. Fears of religious warfare are potent in Lebanon, where a civil war between Christian and pro-Palestinian Muslim militias killed an estimated 150,000 people from 1975 until 1990.

"(CNN) -- A Canadian firetruck responding with lights and sirens to a weekend fire in Rouses Point, New York, was stopped at the U.S. border for about eight minutes, U.S. border officials said Tuesday. The U.S.-Canadian border is more than 5,000 miles long. Fire officials battling the blaze called for help from fire departments in nearby Quebec, using a longstanding and often-used mutual aid agreement. But the first truck that arrived at the small Rouses Point border crossing was delayed as officials checked documentation of the firefighters and their truck, officials confirmed. Two other trucks that arrived at the crossing next were cleared in less than two minutes each, a time that one fire official said was still too long considering the situation. ""It's embarrassing,"" said Chris Trombley, chief of the Champlain [New York] Volunteer Fire Department and deputy fire coordinator for Clinton County Emergency Services. ""We're calling for help from another country and the first roadblock they hit is at our border."" The Canadian firefighters ""were asked for IDs,"" Trombley said. ""I believe they even ran the license plate on the truck to make sure it was legal."" In the past, firetrucks on emergency calls cleared border checkpoints in 30 seconds or less, Trombley said, although he said identification is sometimes checked upon their return. A U.S. Customs and Border Protection official said the eight-minute delay at the Rouses Point crossing was caused ""when one of the firefighters' admissibility was brought into question."" He declined to elaborate, citing immigration and privacy laws. A government source familiar with the case said one firefighter had a criminal record, raising questions about whether he could enter the United States. Kevin Corsaro of the border protection's Buffalo field office said the agency's primary responsibility is to protect the homeland. He called the event an ""isolated incident"" and said agency officials  were meeting with local fire officials to ""develop a plan to prevent the possibility of any delays."" No one was seriously injured in the fire, but The Anchorage Inn restaurant -- a landmark in the village of Rouses Point -- was destroyed. A firefighter who suffered minor smoke inhalation was treated at the scene, said Michael LeBlanc, chief of the Rouses Point Volunteer Fire Department. The cause of the blaze has not been determined, he said. Ten fire departments, including the Canadian departments, responded to the fire. ""Would it [quicker passage at the border] have changed the outcome of the fire?"" Trombley asked. ""Would the building have been burned? Of course it would."" But he said firefighters were getting fatigued fighting the fire and relief was delayed. ""Just the fact that it could happen and it could happen again is what has us worried,"" he said. Clinton County has mutual aid agreements with fire departments in Vermont and Quebec, Trombley said, and the county requests help from Quebec fire departments about 30 times a year. It sends help to Canada a similar number of times, he said. Trombley and LeBlanc said they planned to meet with authorities on Wednesday to discuss the incident. LeBlanc declined to comment. ""I don't have all the facts and I don't want to mistake what happened,"" he said. ""We've had a mutual aid system in place since the '50s and I can't remember anything like this happening,"" said Trombley.

"Amman, Jordan (CNN) -- Even as the world's military chiefs gathered in Jordan to debate their next move on Syria, the host nation is keen to keep the talks under wraps. Official statements have been scant, the precise date, time and location seem secret. Expect no post-meeting press conference either, we are told. The ""why"" is very simple: Jordan fears if it appears in any way to become a spring board for strikes on Syria, it will suffer. How it will suffer and why lies buried in layers of history as complex as the shifting desert sands here. This tiny kingdom has ducked and dived the worst of the regional roiling stirred by the 2011 Arab Spring. Yet the few protests here seem to highlight dissatisfaction with a monarchy the West has come to rely on. A U.S. defense official told CNN no agreements were signed at meetings Monday as ""this was not a planning meeting, where we come ready to discuss a specific way forward."" But he did say the meetings focused on ways the escalating conflict in Syria could spill over into neighboring countries and affect regional security as a whole. King Abdullah of Jordan rules over a population who have seen food and gas prices rise to the point of pain; they endured the arrival of 100,000's of refugees from both Iraq and Syria, pushing up property prices. When they want the hurt to stop they look up to Abdullah. Most still suffer. To say Jordan is not the most stable of Arab States right now might seem to fly in the face convention. Tourists are still safe here and although they don't flock in the droves they used to, the country's fabled historic sites like the Nabataean ruins in Petra are awash with all shades of international sightseers. But scratch the surface and the have-nots far outnumber the haves. Most agree that corruption is at the root of the growing divide. The Muslim Brotherhood, long a latent force for change here, exploits the inequalities. Their brothers in Egypt, now under the heel of the military, serve as both reminder and reason to wait their moment. And the often unspoken tension here between Palestinians and Jordanians finds greater voice today than in preceding decades. An Israeli-Palestinian peace deal, once again under serious debate, could turn once loyal subjects on their leaders if it upsets the careful balance here -- Jordanians in government, Palestinians in business. In short it would not take much for Bashar al Assad whose forces, an hour and a half drive to the north of Amman and well within missile range of the capital, to turn Jordan into turmoil. So no surprise that this meeting, that was, we are told, planned weeks before the alleged chemical attack in Damascus, has shrunk in profile to be almost invisible. Even U.S. officials appeared to play tag over who can say what. One directs us to the other for comment, and so on. One trusted source here told me of his surprise any details of the meeting had been leaked. For Jordan to host this meeting, at the very moment U.N. weapons inspectors in Damascus are being shot at as they try to figure out if chemical weapons were used, invites the Syrian regime to take the view their tiny neighbor is up to no good. The real fear is this. If military chiefs walk away from their secure chambers here leaving even the tiniest inkling that while on Jordanian soil they would precipitate a strike or intervention in Syria, then Jordan could face terrorist attack or worse from Syria. With chemical weapons now apparently freely in play, few would rule out the possibility those same gun barrels could be directed toward King Abdullah's people. All this said, there is no secret here that weapons are being smuggled across Jordan's border to Syrian rebels. Saudi Arabia is quite proud of its role in this, although Jordanian officials deny the help and say they work to block such smuggling. The real secrets are more intangible. For example, on how much of a hair trigger are the chemical weapons? And what about the U.S. and Jordanian special forces here, hidden away on army bases? How quickly could they be mobilized? It's a worry that many Jordanians have: how quickly could their own stability crumble.

"St. Petersburg, Florida (CNN) -- Crippled by the brutal wind and waves of Hurricane Sandy, the HMS Bounty was sinking. Capt. Robin Walbridge had ordered his crew of 15 to abandon ship in the early morning of October 29, 90 miles off North Carolina. Searching the ship a final time before escaping to a waiting lifeboat, a crew member peered through the captain's rarely opened door. There she noticed that Walbridge's treasured framed photograph of his wife, Claudia McCann, was missing from its place on his desk. During the escape from the 50-year-old wooden ship, the captain clearly had taken his prized picture with him. Now, four months later, that story about her husband's final moments still touches McCann. ""Of all the things he could have grabbed, I guess a picture wasn't going to weigh him down,"" she said last week from her 1930s historic home in St. Petersburg. ""But it was going to be with him."" Wearing a medallion carved with the image of the Bounty, McCann, who never took her husband's name, shared stories she's been hearing from survivors of the shipwreck. As the U.S. Coast Guard begins hearings Tuesday in Portsmouth, Virginia, to determine if negligence was involved, McCann is defending Walbridge against criticism that his decisions somehow put the ship at risk. On October 29, the three-masted replica of an 18th-century ship -- which starred in classic movies such as Marlon Brando's ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" and Johnny Depp's ""Pirates of the Carribean"" -- was threatened by a real-life drama as it took on water and lost power. At one point when Walbridge was below deck, enormous waves tossed the vessel, slamming the captain into a table, said McCann. Walbridge, 63, was so seriously injured that he needed help putting on his rescue suit and life jacket as he prepared to abandon ship. McCann said crew members' accounts conflict about whether or not the captain ever was able to escape the Bounty before it went down. Related: Sandy claims 50-year-old tourism attraction . Remembering that terrible time, McCann, sitting in her sunroom, stared out across her backyard. One of his last e-mails to her, she said, was saying he was going to abandon ship. It said ""not to worry"" because the Coast Guard knew where he was. Eventually, the Coast Guard rescued all but two crew members: Walbridge and Claudene Christian, 42. Related: Shipwreck victim inspired by mutineer . McCann always believed her husband was going to be all right. She said he always had a ""silver lining"" floating over his head, protecting him from harm. For 90 hours, the Coast Guard searched 12,000 square miles in hopes of finding the captain. Then, four days after the shipwreck, McCann received a call from the Coast Guard. ""It was just as hard for them to say it as it was for me to hear it -- that they were going to abandon the search,"" she said, pausing for a moment. ""But I knew they did their best."" Of all the terrifying moments and heartbreaking news surrounding the Bounty disaster, the hardest part for McCann is that her husband's body was never found. Her sadness comes in waves. ""Interesting -- yeah, yeah it comes in waves,"" she said with a grin. Walbridge was quite a sailor, his widow recalled -- a breath of fresh air filled with positive energy. He was highly respected in his industry, and everyone wanted to sail with him, McCann said. He had some qualities associated with sailors, friends and family said, like enjoying a drink or two now and then with other seafarers at ""scuzzy"" bars in various ports of call. He also had traits that clashed with the cliche of the rough-and-tumble sailing life. ""I never heard a curse word come out of his mouth -- he was so even-keeled,"" said McCann's daughter, Shelly McCann, Walbridge's stepdaughter. Criticism . Some sailors in the tall ship community have been critical of Walbridge's decision to leave safe harbor in New London, Connecticut, for St. Petersburg as Sandy was steaming up the East Coast. That frustrates McCann and her adult daughter, Shelly. People ""who were not there"" have no right to pass judgment, the McCanns said. The facts surrounding Walbridge's decisions may come out during the weeklong Coast Guard hearing. ""The point of the investigation is to determine the cause and to see if there are any changes that could be made, industry- or regulatorywise, to prevent incidents like this from occurring in the future,"" said Chief Petty Officer Nyx Cangemi, U.S. Coast Guard spokesman. WAVY-TV: Coast Guard begins hearings into shipwreck . McCann said she never questioned her husband's decision to leave port. ""I would never even think twice about telling him to do something against his decision. Who am I -- I know nothing about that."" The captain's close friend Ralph McCutcheon, sitting across from McCann at the table in the sunroom, quickly chimed in: ""We'd been through two other hurricanes -- ones with higher seas -- in '96."" ""The ship was in the best shape it ever been since it was built,"" McCutcheon said. It had just completed a mandatory inspection required by the Coast Guard every two years. While not questioning Walbridge's decision, Shelly McCann said she wishes her stepfather had never left port. At one of the two memorial services held for Walbridge, surviving crew members presented the McCanns with a handmade card, signed by all of them. The cards and e-mails from survivors have been a comfort -- evidence once again of that ""silver lining."" 'Robinisms' Wrote one past crew member: ""I think Robin has become a surrogate father for some of us ... to have a consistent and reliable man who encouraged us and gave us responsibility -- changed lives."" Claudia McCann said she ""didn't realize the magnitude or the enormity of people that he touched."" One of the memorial services took place in Fall River, Massachusetts, where Shelly McCann recalled little sayings Walbridge was known for. Crews called them ""Robinisms,"" including, ""Wakey wakey, little guppies"" and ""Wakey wakey, little snakies."" Claudia McCann remembers the couple working as extras in some of the films the Bounty appeared in. She scrolls through photos on her computer of herself and her husband dressed in costumes. It all brings back bittersweet memories. Thousands of other irreplaceable photos were on the captain's computer and hard drive which she said went down with the ship -- lost forever. But it's just stuff, she said. ""Missing Robin, I can't put that in perspective at all. There's just emptiness in my soul because he was my soul mate,"" Claudia McCann said, as tears filled her eyes. ""I hear it fills in. And I hope it does."" She believes her husband went down with his ship, likely trying to help his crew member Christian escape. Many sailors have told Claudia McCann that -- for lovers of the ocean -- there's no better final resting place. That's a thought that comforts her, although she would have preferred placing his remains in the sea herself. ""I guess silver linings ... come to an end,"" she said. ""But he had his share of silver linings.""

"Dallas (CNN) -- Federal, state and local authorities investigating the deaths of two Texas prosecutors executed a search warrant Friday afternoon at the home of a former Kaufman County justice of the peace, an FBI spokeswoman said. Katherine Chaumont told CNN that an FBI team was part of the Friday afternoon search at the home of Eric Williams. Williams last year was convicted of burglary and theft by a public servant, and was sentenced to two years' probation. Mark Hasse, chief felony prosecutor in the county, was gunned down January 31 outside the courthouse. Hasse prosecuted the Williams case. Hours after Kaufman County District Attornney Mike McLelland and his wife, Cynthia, were found dead March 30 at their Forney home, investigators met at a local Denny's restaurant with Williams, his attorney told CNN earlier this month. Investigators took swab samples from Williams' hand to test him for gun residue, Williams' attorney, David Sergi, said. Results were not made public by authorities but Sergi said the tests were negative. On Friday, Sergi released a statement saying that Williams ""has cooperated with law enforcement and vigorously denies any and all allegations. He wishes simply to get on with his life and hopes that the perpetrators are brought to justice."" Earlier this month, Williams told North Texas TV station KXAS he understood why authorities would want to meet with him after the McLellands' death. ""If I was in their shoes, I would want to talk to me,"" Williams said. ""In the investigators' minds, they want to check with me to do their process of elimination."" Williams said he has cooperated with law enforcement. ""I certainly wish them the best in bringing justice to this incredibly egregious act,"" he said. Williams told the station he has no ill will toward prosecutors, saying they were ""doing their jobs.""

The cards only work at four stores for now: Target, Jamba Juice, Sephora and The Olive Garden. So if you've been wondering how to give your little sister a birthday gift that combines fruit smoothies, lip gloss and unlimited breadsticks, this product is for you. When you buy a card on the social network for a friend, they get a message informing them of the gift right away (great for scrambling at the last minute). The cash amount is loaded on to a plastic card that is delivered in the mail, likely in some sort of paper envelope. The recipient can then take that physical card into a physical store and buy physical goods. For an Internet company, it's all delightfully old fashioned. The cards will be rolling out gradually for Facebook users in the United States. Facebook is entering a crowded field and offers a couple of features to differentiate itself from other gift cards. The gift giver can choose which of the available stores to give money to -- say $5 to cover a drink at Jamba Juice and $20 for home goods at Target. The recipient can monitor the balances on their card from the Facebook app (but they can't move the money between vendors, no matter how much they would rather have mascara than pasta). Any gift amounts they get in the future are automatically added to the same card. Facebook launched its Gifts feature in September for physical goods like chocolate, shirts, flowers and wine, as well as virtual items like donations to charity, Uber credit and Netflix subscriptions. It also offered gift cards for specific vendors such as Starbucks and iTunes. This new card is different because it will work at multiple retailers, is refillable and integrates with the Facebook app. Even though you can see your card's balance on a smartphone, there aren't mobile payment options at the moment. Facebook cards aren't compatible with existing mobile payment technology like NFC, QR codes or barcodes that allow people to pay for goods with their mobile phone. For now the company is sticking with the traditional plastic rectangle and magnetic-strip technology that is most widely accepted across the United States. The new product falls somewhere between store-specific cards and bank-issued open gift cards that can be used almost anywhere credit cards are accepted. It also may create some privacy issues. In order to receive the card, the recipient will have to share their mailing address with Facebook, which might make some people uncomfortable. Gift cards are an easy workaround for people who don't have enough time or personal knowledge to pick out a specific gift. Like cash, you know it will be useful and there's no danger of getting people something they will hate. Choosing cards from specific vendors like a favorite coffee spot or clothing store can be slightly more personal than a Visa card to be used anywhere. With this card you can mix and match stores. Facebook has been experimenting with all kinds of money-making schemes in the past year, like paying to send messages to strangers. Most of the company's revenue comes from advertising -- 84%, according to the latest earnings report -- but it also makes some money off games and programs like Facebook Gifts. The social network says it has more than a billion active users, and that's a largely untapped resource. A Facebook spokesperson said the company had nothing to share about how it will make money off the Card service. There are no fees for the gift giver or gift receiver, so Facebook is likely earning a percentage from the participating companies.","Facebook is adding gift cards to its Gifts service for users in the United States .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Douglas led a dozen Hollywood A-listers in a video aimed at reminding President Barack Obama that he told the world four years ago of the need to eliminate all nuclear weapons. ""I demand zero,"" said each star, including Oscar winners Douglas, Matt Damon, Morgan Freeman, Whoopi Goldberg, Christoph Waltz and Robert De Niro. The video script consists of lines straight from Obama's landmark speech in the Czech Republic capital of Prague on April 5, 2009. ""Today, I state clearly and with conviction America's commitment to seek the peace and security,"" Obama is heard saying -- with Douglas and Naomi Watts both completing his sentence -- ""of a world without nuclear weapons."" CNN Poll: Obama approval falls amid controversies . The celebrities -- also including Martin Sheen, Danny DeVito, Alec Baldwin, John Cusack and Zoe Kravitz -- tag-team to deliver Obama's words: . ""This matters to people everywhere... Some argue that the spread of these weapons cannot be stopped, cannot be checked... Such fatalism is a deadly adversary... For if we believe that the spread of nuclear weapons is inevitable, then in some way we are admitting to ourselves that the use of nuclear weapons is inevitable. To denounce a call for cooperation is an easy but also a cowardly thing to do. That's how wars begin. That's where human progress ends. Make no mistake, when we fail to pursue peace then it stays forever beyond our grasp. It will take patience and persistence. But now we must ignore the voices who tell us that the world cannot change. Human destiny will be what we make of it. Let us bridge our divisions, build upon our hopes, accept our responsibility to leave this world more prosperous and more peaceful than we found it."" North Korea proposes high-level talks with U.S. The video concludes with Obama speaking: ""The world must stand together to prevent the spread of these weapons."" Global Zero -- a Washington-based group whose founders include Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel -- produced and released the two-minute video online just before Obama's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the annual G8 summit in Northern Ireland that starts Monday. The United States and Russia hold 90% of the world's 17,000 nuclear weapons. There were 70,000 near the end of the Cold War in the mid-1980s. An open letter to Obama that accompanied the video calls for the president ""to negotiate further cuts to the massive U.S.-Russian Cold War stockpiles and pave the way to bringing world leaders into the first international negotiations in history for the elimination of all nuclear weapons.""

"Sydney (CNN) -- Tony Abbott is a throwback to older, safer times when a knockabout Aussie bloke could call a sheila ""a good sort"" and no one among those who understood the slang for a good-looking woman would blink. And it seems that much of Australia likes him that way -- the latest opinion polls have the 55-year-old Australian conservative opposition leader set to be the country's next prime minister after the federal election on September 7. Never mind the fact Australia's first female Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, went viral with her damning misogyny speech about Abbott in the Australian Parliament -- ""I will not be lectured about sexism and misogyny by this man. I will not."" Never mind that a suitably solemn Abbott sat across from the Labor PM as she listed statement after statement of his that cemented his sexist credentials. Never mind that women around the world cheered to hear a female leader name it and shame it. At home, Gillard's angry performance earlier this year proved to be nothing but a glancing blow. Those women who had long loathed him as a sexist felt vindicated. Some commentators tried to de-fang the attack by going to town on the fact Gillard had conflated sexism and misogyny. But it was all water off the backs of those Australians who thought then, and now, it's time for a change of government and Abbott's attitude to women is not a significant issue. As veteran feminist Eva Cox says: ""He's an 'old-fashioned' sexist, not a woman hater. It's just that he doesn't get that equality means treating women as normal human beings. He can't resist making the odd sexist ha-ha comment."" His deputy Julie Bishop disagrees Abbott is sexist. She told Channel 9's Today program: ""He's always been very respectful and supportive of me and my other female colleagues."" A few months after her famous speech, Gillard was ousted at the hands of her real rival, the former Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, whom she had helped to remove from office. As Gillard now sits on the sidelines, possibly enjoying a small twinge of relief that she is no longer subjected to almost daily attacks on her appearance, her body shape and voice, Australians find themselves in the middle of a testosterone-fueled election campaign. Yet strangely, as Rudd exhorts Abbott to ""man up"" and Abbott demands his opponent ""be man enough,"" the campaign has placed sexism front and center once again. This week Abbott was forced to dump a male candidate over a web forum which, according to media reports, included jokes about women making love on pool tables and ""tit banter."" Abbott, meanwhile, has suffered no harm electorally. He is an unreconstructed male who loves his sport, likes a beer and bravely tries to don the garb of man who cares about women -- in the right way. He now trots out one or several of his female family members, including his gay sister, to prove his credentials as a female-friendly politician. Trouble is, he just keeps having ""Dad moments."" On the campaign trail outside Sydney last week he listed ""sex appeal"" as one of the key attributes of his party's local candidate, Fiona Scott. There was no mention of her MBA or successful business career. He later described it as ""exuberance"" and a ""dad moment"" after his 20-year-old daughter Bridget told reporters: ""Dad is running for prime minister so he can't have any sort of daggy [uncool] moments. Everyone's Dad is daggy in their own sort of way at times."" His daughter's comments took the sting out of Abbott's gaffe and may have convinced a few female voters that he is trying hard to curb outbreaks of his old-school attitudes. Abbott and his team appear to have decided that his sexist gaffes add to his knockabout ""larrikin"" charm -- always an asset for a successful male Australian politician -- and that a few lame ""dad"" comments will appeal to voters who also pull their rough-hewn males up in this way. It would explain why, a few days after his ""sex appeal"" moment, Abbott was back in front of the cameras with Scott and, far from apologizing, he was on about her looks again. Commenting on her answer to a question about his economic plan, he quipped: ""Obviously from that answer she ain't just a pretty face."" Scott's response was on message. There was no need to apologize for an ""absolutely charming compliment between friends."" Now Abbott has upped the ante for female voters, throwing on the table what is the most expensive siren call to them Australia has ever seen. It's a policy which his minders no doubt hope will erase forever the lingering smear of sexism and misogyny. He is offering a generous -- extravagant even, according to economic commentators -- paid parental leave scheme that signals his deeply-held social policy ambitions and old-fashioned family values. The scheme has put him at odds with business groups and many in his own party who have failed to dissuade him from it. It has also led to claims from unions that the scheme is unfair to low-paid women. The A$5.5 billion (US$5 billion) scheme gives working mothers six months' leave on full pay, capped at a salary of A$150,000 (US$135,000). About half of the cost will be covered by a 1.5% levy on taxable incomes over A$5 million (US$4.5 million) of the 3,000 largest Australian companies. This will be offset by a cut in company tax, but what has not been detailed is where the rest will come from, apart from ''associated reductions in other outlays.'' The announcement has had a mixed response from female commentators, with Cox declaring that the ""shrill"" criticism of the scheme by some feminists was personal, not political. ""There are a lot feminist groups that are so anti-Abbott that they are objecting to this because it's come from him."" Melbourne University Press publisher Louise Adler, who published his book ""Battlelines,"" agrees that Abbott has been unpopular with women, but of his paid parental leave scheme she stated she was ""in favor of anything that assists families to be with their children."" It is another nail in the coffin of the national conversation about women and leadership and sexism that Gillard's show-stopping speech ignited but which died away with her departure from the political stage. A News poll this week confirmed that female Labor voters deserted Gillard and have returned to the fold since Rudd took over. Yallana Burgess, 29, told The Australian she had not backed Gillard, but would be supporting Rudd. Gillard, she said, had not been a role model for women ""and she wasn't charismatic... she could have used her position as a woman more effectively and I never got the sense that she was herself."" Cox believes Gillard's speech failed to ignite a national war on sexism because the former prime minister was not much of a feminist. ""She was not a feminist leader. She didn't play the gender card -- although that was a plus. She was also not a promoter of the anti-sexist thing. She didn't make a big appeal to the women of Australia -- she didn't pitch for it. ""A lot of women were passionate about supporting her, but they were in a minority,"" says Cox. It remains to be seen at the ballot box if Abbott's multi-billion dollar policy pitch to women trumps any ""embarrassing dad"" sexist tendencies or female Labor voters' preference for Rudd over Gillard. But surely it says something about the level of ""old fashioned"" political debate in Australia when one of the country's more colorful mining magnates, Clive Palmer, feels the need to stress his own candidacy with this tweet: ""My hair is not as silky as Rudd's and my body not as toned as Abbott's but I offer common sense and real business experience #ausvotes.""","Australian leadership candidate has been accused of sexism, misogyny .

"(CNN) -- Remember earlier this year when Wikipedia went black in protest of anti-piracy legislation moving through the U.S. Congress? Yeah, well, that may be nothing compared to this. A group called the Internet Defense League, borrowing a page from Batman, is trying to create a ""bat signal"" for mobilizing open-Internet activists against similar legislation. The group's tagline: ""Make sure the Internet never loses. Ever."" Technically, it's more of a ""cat signal,"" since the group's website, which launched a couple weeks ago, features a picture of a cat's face being broadcast into the sky. ""It's a cat signal because we see the cat as the symbol of the Internet,"" said Tiffiniy Cheng, co-director of the nonprofit Fight for the Future, which helped organize recent piracy legislation protests and is behind the new site. ""There's this academic theory ... that talks about if you ban the ability of people to share cat photos, they'll start protesting en masse."" She added: ""The idea is we're building the infrastructure to put up this cat signal or this bat signal all over the Internet at a moment's notice, with the click of a button."" The Internet went haywire in January when Congress was considering two pieces of legislation -- nicknamed SOPA and PIPA -- that aimed to help the government crack down on the online distribution of pirated content. The English-language version of Wikipedia shut down for 24 hours in protest of the proposed legislation, which died after the digitally based protests. Time Warner, the parent company of CNN, supported the legislation, along with several movie and music industry groups. The Internet Defense League says it is targeting two upcoming pieces of legislation, ACTA and CISPA, which take different approaches to regulating pirated content. The group also will seek promises from U.S. presidential candidates on the subject of Internet openness and legislation, according to Cheng. ""For the past 10 years at least, tech policy has not been based on what's good for the public interest,"" she said. The group says it has the support of some big names on the Web, including WordPress, craigslist founder Craig Newmark, Reddit, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Cheezburger Network, which owns several humor blogs. Cheng declined to comment on whether larger commercial websites like Google and Facebook would consider supporting the effort. Pundits have wondered whether this is the dawn of a new era for Internet activism, especially from tech and Web companies that, in the past, have been less political. ""This is the first real test of the political strength of the Web, and regardless of how things go, they are no longer a pushover,"" Tim Wu, from Columbia Law School, told the New York Times during the Web protests in January. ""The Web taking a stand against one of the most powerful lobbyers and seeming to get somewhere is definitely a first."" The Internet Defense League aims to expand on that energy, alerting supporters to new threats to ""Internet freedom"" when they arise. A co-founder of the group, Reddit's Alexis Ohanian, explained the idea to Forbes this way: . ""You can only cry 'Oh my gosh, they're going to shut down the Internet' so often. We've scared (Congress) from doing anything as egregious as SOPA and PIPA again. But the new challenge is this endless series of smaller bills that try to unravel Internet rights."" On its site, the group pitches its battle against anti-Internet legislation as a sort of duel between all-knowing geeks and uneducated or ""confused"" public officials: . ""Internet freedom and individual power are changing the course of history. But entrenched institutions and monopolies want this to stop. Elected leaders often don't understand the Internet, so they're easily confused or corrupted."" It adds: ""With the combined reach of our websites and social networks, we can be massively more effective than any one organization."" The Internet Defense League site lets people donate money to the cause and, perhaps more powerfully, rally people for or against certain pieces of legislation. When there's an Internet ""emergency,"" the group says it will send out snippets of code that will help websites participate in the protests. Cheng said participating companies or bloggers can choose to have messages displayed on their sites automatically or to field the messages on a case-by-case basis. By creating the code for Web developers to use, Cheng said it become much faster to mobilize people online. That's what made the anti-SOPA Web blackouts so effective, she said. ""The tool was easy to use. It was a low bar to being used,"" she said. ""That was a turning point because the form of protest was very stark and clear and was an example of what Internet censorship could look like. ""And these tools allowed us to reach millions of people very quickly.""","Internet Defense League aims to mobilize Web activists .

"(CNN) -- CNN ""Early Start"" co-anchor Zoraida Sambolin has been diagnosed with breast cancer and will have a double mastectomy, she told viewers Tuesday while discussing film star Angelina Jolie's decision to have the surgery as a preventative measure. ""I struggled for weeks trying to figure out how tell you that I had been diagnosed with breast cancer and was leaving to have surgery,"" Sambolin said in a posting to her Facebook page Tuesday. ""Then, Angelina Jolie shares her story of a double mastectomy and gives me strength and an opening."" Jolie announced in a New York Times op-ed published Tuesday that she had undergone double mastectomy surgery after learning she has an elevated risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer. During her ""Early Start"" appearance, Sambolin said the decision to opt for a mastectomy was a difficult one, but was made easier by reading Jolie's perspective. ""She said I feel empowered, that I'm in a strong choice that in no way diminishes my femininity,"" Sambolin said. ""You know, it's nice to hear somebody else talk about it and have that support of a lot of women around you."" ""At the end of the day, I need to have peace of mind,"" she added. ""I need to sleep at night. I have two kids that are my world, like any woman, and it's what you think about.

"(CNN) -- The man accused of hacking celebrities' online accounts -- from which private images were ultimately posted on the Internet -- says he became ""addicted"" to the intrusion and ""didn't know how to stop."" ""I deeply apologize. I know what I did was probably one of the worst invasions of privacy someone could experience,"" Christopher Chaney told CNN affiliate WAWS/WTEV in Jacksonville, Florida, Wednesday. ""And these people don't have privacy to begin with. And I was in that little sliver of privacy they do have."" Federal authorities accuse the 35-year-old of hacking into accounts on computers and other devices belonging to more than 50 people, including movie stars Scarlett Johansson and Mila Kunis and singer Christina Aguilera. Chaney was indicted on charges of accessing protected computers without authorization, damaging protected computers, wiretapping and aggravated identity theft, officials said. ""Unfortunately, Mr. Chaney was able to access nude photos of some of the celebrities and some of them were uploaded on the Internet,"" U.S. Attorney Andre Birotte Jr. said Wednesday. A recently circulated nude photo of Johannsson is part of the investigation, he said. Chaney allegedly ""also took financial information, movie scripts and conversations that the celebrities believed to be private,"" Birotte told reporters. The FBI's Los Angeles office said he was arrested as part of ""Operation Hackerazzi,"" which looked into computer intrusions targeting individuals associated with the entertainment industry. In the interview with WAWS/WTEV, Chaney said the hacking ""started as curiosity and it turned into just being, you know, addicted to seeing the behind-the-scenes of what's going on with these people you see on the big screen every day."" ""It just happened and snowballed,"" he said, adding that he wishes it had never begun. Chaney said he felt ""almost relieved months ago"" when authorities seized his computer because ""I didn't know how to stop doing it myself. I wasn't attempting to break into e-mails and get stuff to sell or purposely put it on the Internet. It just -- I don't know."" Authorities allege that Chaney distributed photos of the celebrities that he obtained illegally and offered them to various celebrity blog sites. Some of the illegally obtained files, including private photographs, were ultimately posted online ""as a result of Chaney's alleged activities,"" authorities said in a statement. ""I've had like six months to think about it,"" Chaney said, ""it eats at me... When you're doing it you're not thinking about what's going on with who you're doing it to."" Chaney allegedly was able to access passwords by monitoring social media and other online sites that the celebrities used, said Steven Martinez, assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles field office. ""You may have selected a password that's meaningful to you that you may disclose online with friends,"" Martinez said. ""Your pet's name or whatever. That's a clue to a hacker, to start there."" The suspect used several aliases such as ""trainreqsuckswhat,"" ""anonygrrl,"" and ""jaxjaguars911,"" authorities said in a news release. Chaney also allegedly used public sources to mine data about his victims, which included both males and females, all associated with the entertainment industry, authorities said. Authorities allege that once Chaney hacked into a celebrity's e-mail account, he would use the contact lists to find other celebrities' e-mail accounts. This allowed him to add new victims, authorities charge. Chaney made his initial appearance in U.S. District Court in Jacksonville, Florida, on Wednesday afternoon, and was released on a $10,000 unsecured bond with the conditions that he can't use any computer or other device with Internet access and he can't have any controlled substances or excessive use of alcohol, said Laura Eimiller, an FBI spokeswoman in Los Angeles. Chaney's next court appearance will be at 10:30 a.m. Friday for an identity hearing in the same courthouse, Eimiller said. Chaney has been indicted on nine counts of computer hacking for gain, eight counts of aggravated identify theft, and nine counts of illegal wiretapping, Birotte said. If convicted of the 26 counts, Chaney would face a maximum of 121 years in federal prison, Birotte said. The aggravated identity theft charge alone carries a mandatory two-year prison sentence, he added. Chaney allegedly set his victims' accounts to automatically forward their e-mails to his account, Birotte said. This allegedly allowed Chaney to continue to receive celebrities' e-mails even after a password was reset, authorities said. Martinez said authorities coined the term ""hackerazzi"" to describe this kind of intrusion. ""The paparazzi is always chasing them down, and now you have a virtual way of doing it by looking at posts they put on social media sites,"" Martinez said. In 2005, hackers logged into Paris Hilton's phone and stole photos of her, according to Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at the F-Secure computer security company. Those hackers reportedly were able to break into Hilton's phone by correctly guessing the not-so-secret answer to her security question, which was ""tinkerbell,"" the name of her pet Chihuahua. In August, rapper Kreayshawn wrote on her blog that her Twitter account was hacked when naked photos of her showed up there. In March, Vanessa Hudgens of ""High School Musical"" underwent a similar ordeal after photos were reportedly stolen from her Gmail account. And in December, police in Germany alleged two young men had used computer-hacking skills to gain access to the e-mail accounts and photos of more than 50 celebrities, according to Britain's The Telegraph, including the likes of Lady Gaga and Ke$ha. In the wake of the latest celebrity hacking allegations, some have started to assume celebrity photo leaks are the newest front in the so-called ""hacktivist"" wars, waged by big-name hacking rings such as Anonymous and LulzSec. Those groups have claimed responsibility for taking down bank and government websites. But security experts said connections between celebrity hackers and groups such as Anonymous are thin or nonexistent. ""It's obviously to gain media exposure, right?"" said Kevin Mitnick, a hacker turned security consultant and author of ""Ghost in the Wires."" ""It's like everyone is trying to one-up Anonymous and one-up LulzSec. So somehow celebrities are becoming a target."" CNN's Michael Martinez, Josh Levs, Carey Bodenheimer and John D.

"Washington (CNN) -- A showdown meeting Tuesday between U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and the House Oversight Committee chairman failed to resolve their dispute, which could result in a contempt vote against the nation's top prosecutor. Holder and Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, met for about 40 minutes to discuss Issa's demand for more documents relating to Operation Fast and Furious, a botched federal firearms sting operation that allowed weapons to reach Mexican drug gangs. After the meeting, Issa told reporters that Holder has yet to provide the documents sought by the panel. Unless at least some of the documents are handed over before the committee meets Wednesday morning, it will proceed in considering a contempt measure, Issa said. ""We are disappointed,"" Issa said. ""We never expected to get all the documents. Our hope was and still is that later this evening we'll get the documents."" Holder said he offered to provide the documents to Issa on the condition that Issa provided his assurance that doing so would satisfy two committee subpoenas and resolve the dispute. ""I think the ball's in their court,"" Holder told reporters. ""They rejected what I thought was an extraordinary offer on our part."" Asked about whether Issa was open to resolving the issue before the committee meets Wednesday, Holder said: ""I think we actually are involved more in political gamesmanship"" instead of a sincere effort to get the requested documents. A Justice Department spokesman reiterated Holder's position that the documents would show Holder had nothing to hide about his role in Fast and Furious. After the meeting, Deputy Attorney General James Cole sent a letter to Issa, expressing disappointment. ""Our offer would have provided the committee with unprecedented access to these documents, many of which are not covered by the committee's subpoenas in this matter,"" he wrote. ""We had hoped that you shared our interest in bringing this matter to an amicable resolution and we regret that you rejected our extraordinary proposal to do so."" The meeting in the Capitol building amounted to both sides reiterating positions already staked out through an exchange of letters over the past week. A committee statement issued before Tuesday's meeting said it was a chance for Holder to meet the panel's demands for additional documents, which would allow for a postponement. ""Currently, (the Department of Justice) has not delivered or shown the committee any of the documents it has said it is prepared to produce,"" the statement continued. ""It is not clear if they will actually produce these documents to the committee before the Wednesday vote to facilitate a postponement."" Holder, however, said he made an unprecedented offer of documents and a briefing to the committee, which so far has turned him down. Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the committee who also attended the meeting, said Holder was trying to end a protracted standoff with the Republican-led panel. ""He sees this as a never-ending process,"" Cummings said in describing Holder's concerns about the continuing requests for more documentation. Another person in the room, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Pat Leahy, D-Vermont, said afterward that he supported Holder and appreciated ""that he is going the extra mile to resolve this."" Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, ranking Republican member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, also participated in the meeting with Holder and Issa. ""The attorney general wants to trade a briefing and the promise of delivering some small, unspecified set of documents tomorrow for a free pass today,"" Grassley said after the meeting. ""He wants to turn over only what he wants to turn over and not give us any information about what he's not turning over. That's unacceptable. I'm not going to buy a pig in a poke."" Issa has accused the attorney general of stonewalling an investigation into Fast and Furious and how the Justice Department provided Congress with erroneous information about it. The department says it already has handed over more than 7,000 pages of records to House investigators, and that the remaining material Issa wants could jeopardize criminal prosecutions. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives launched Operation Fast and Furious out of Arizona to track weapon purchases by Mexican drug cartels. However, it lost track of more than 1,000 firearms that the agency had allowed straw buyers to carry across the border, and two of the lost weapons turned up at the scene of the killing of U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry. Asked by a reporter about why he was pushing so hard, Issa said it was because the nation and Terry's family deserved to know as much information as possible about the program linked to Terry's death. In particular, Issa's committee wants documents that show why the Department of Justice decided to withdraw as inaccurate a February 2011 letter sent to Congress that said top officials had only recently learned about Fast and Furious. The back-and-forth letters exchanged between Holder and Issa before Tuesday's meeting revealed an incremental negotiation over what the committee wanted and what the Department of Justice was offering to provide. In a late Monday letter, Issa made clear he wanted the documents ahead of time and also wanted Grassley, a leading Holder critic, to take part. Holder agreed to a meeting but told Issa he wanted to include Cummings and Leahy. His letter Monday said the purpose of the meeting would be to reach an agreement that would avoid a ""constitutional confrontation,"" a reference to the committee's planned vote on the contempt measure. Last week, Holder fended off a call for his resignation at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, where Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, accused him of misleading Congress over the Fast and Furious program and other misdeeds. Holder called Cornyn's complaint ""almost breathtaking in its inaccuracy,"" adding, ""I don't have any intention of resigning.""

"(CNN) -- A woman who allegedly scammed nearly half a million dollars from a nonprofit fund benefiting the victims of the Boston Marathon bombings was arrested Friday, according to Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley. Audrea Gause, 26, was arrested in Troy, N.Y., where she lives, on a Massachusetts fugitive warrant, a statement from Coakley's office said. She is charged with larceny in Massachusetts . The nonprofit -- The One Fund Boston -- began distributing nearly $61 million to 232 eligible claimants starting June 30, according to a release from the organization. Gause was awarded $480,000 from the fund after claiming she suffered a traumatic brain injury as a result of the Boston Marathon bombing. Following a tip received by both the office of the state attorney general and The One Fund Boston that Gause was not in Boston at the time of the bombing, an official investigation began on Gause's claims, Coakley said at a news conference Friday afternoon. That investigation determined that Gause was not a patient at Boston Medical Center or Albany Medical Center at the times allegedly entered on her notarized claim form, the statement says. ""She was stealing money from the real victims of the Marathon bombing, and from the people who gave so generously to help them,"" Coakley said on Friday. The One Fund Boston divided payments up between four classifications that were based on the severity of injuries or loss of life, according to the fund's statement. More than 260 people were wounded and 3 were killed in the double bombings, which took place near the Boston marathon finish line on April 15. There has been some indication that there may be others involved with Gause's fraudulent claims and the investigation is still ongoing, Coakley said. Gause appeared in Rensselaer County, New York, Court for a fugitive warrant hearing on Friday afternoon, Capt. John Cooney of the Troy Police Department told CNN. Gause was being held without bail in the Rensselaer County Jail. Her next hearing is scheduled for Tuesday, Cooney said. It could not immediately be determined whether Gause had retained an attorney. Coakley's statement said her office, in conjunction with The One Fund, is reviewing all claims submitted to and paid by the fund.","The nonprofit One Fund Boston is distributing $61 million to victims of the Marathon bombing .

"(CNN) -- The reaction to the death of 23-year-old baseball player Christopher Lane has been swift and far-reaching, stretching from America's heartland to his home in Australia. Lane was gunned down in Duncan, Oklahoma, while he was out jogging last week. Three teenagers have been charged as adults in his killing. In Ada, Oklahoma, Lane was remembered as a popular athlete, well-liked by classmates and considered a model student by professors. ""Chris exemplified what a student-athlete is all about,"" said East Central University President John R. Hargrave in a statement Wednesday. ""We will miss Chris, not only for his presence, but the impact he has made on fellow students and athletes."" 'Senseless' shooting sparks call for U.S. boycott . People who never met him have turned to social media and the Internet to share their feelings of the tragedy. The emotions range from shock and sadness to rage and disbelief. That range of emotion is palpable on a website created to raise money for Christopher's family to fly to the United States and take his body back to Australia. The goal of the ""Christopher Lane Fund"" was to collect $15,000. The total now exceeds $60,000. Some of the donations are accompanied by statements shared on the site. ""As a citizen of the United States, I am saddened, embarrassed, and appalled by the unconscionable act that took Christopher's life,"" wrote one contributor, Judy Harless. ""I pray for your family, and Christopher, in the hopes that you may find peace after this tragedy. I also pray for our leaders that they find the strength and morality to implement gun laws that prevent such senseless acts and, lastly, for our youth who do not value life, are devoid of compassion, and have no humanity."" Another contributor, Richard Kimpel, put the blame for the ""senseless tragedy"" on ""a society that allows so many young boys to grow up without being taught respect for life. I am so so sorry for your loss. Please find some comfort in knowing that he is in good company with the Lord now."" People have also turned to Twitter to express their feelings, including Los Angeles Dodgers player Peter Moylan. An Australian, Moylan tweeted: ""Tonight I continued my dream of playing pro baseball, a dream that was stolen from Chris Lane by 3 cowards."" Lane loved the game of baseball, but he was planning on earning a degree in finance and starting a real estate business with his family. ""Chris was talented enough to play baseball, but he used that as a pathway to a collegiate education,"" said ECU Director of Athletics Jeff Williams on Wednesday. Sam Malchar, who was Christopher's teammate at the university, remembered his charm. ""The first thing that you would notice about Chris was his strong Australian accent, which would just draw people toward him, especially in Oklahoma where most people have never heard it other than in the movies,"" he said in a statement. ""But there were a lot more reasons to talk to him than just an accent. You wanted to talk to him because he was the kind of guy who you could tell anything, one of those people you just loved to be around. He was a very witty and lighthearted guy, always able to lighten up the mood. ""Not a lot of people would move halfway around the world to get an education and build a better life, but he did. Chris was a charming guy, a genuinely good person, with great character and had a love for life,"" he said. ""Chris was the kind of guy you want your sons to grow up to be and that you want your daughters to marry. It just breaks my heart knowing how much more he could have brought to this world as a husband, father, son, brother and friend.""","Christopher Lane gunned down in Duncan, Oklahoma, while he was out jogging last week .

"(CNN) -- Investigators have found human remains at the site of a crash in northern Mexico believed to have killed Mexican-American singer Jenni Rivera, but the family continues to hold on to a sliver of hope for a miracle. Civil aviation officials say they believe no one survived the crash. Yet Rivera's family says hope is the last thing to go. Authorities would not describe the condition of the remains, but said they do not know how many people they belong to. The remains were found Tuesday at the site of the wreckage and were transported to Monterrey, the same city the private Learjet took off from, said Priscila Rivas, spokeswoman for the state's public ministry. It is too early to tell if Rivera's remains were among those found, Rivas said, but DNA tests are under way. Test results could take anywhere from a day to weeks, she said. Rivera's brother, Lupillo, arrived in Monterrey from the family's home in Lakewood, California. Before he left California, he described the situation as ""95% bad news,"" but added that the family is clinging to the small hope that Jenni Rivera somehow survived. A makeshift altar with flowers, balloons and candles appeared on the family's front lawn. ""I trust in God, and he gives me strength,"" said Rivera's mother, Rosa Rivera. ""I know that if indeed (she's dead), I would thank God for the time he shared her with me, for the precious time she called me Mother."" Six others, including two pilots, were thought to be on board the plane, which lost contact with air traffic controllers soon after takeoff. Born in Long Beach, California, to Mexican immigrant parents, Rivera, 43, released her debut album in 1999, according to her website. She sings traditional Mexican ballads, and was nominated for a Latin Grammy Award in 2002 in the category of ""Best Banda Album."" In October, People en Espanol named Rivera to its list of the 25 most powerful women. Famous for her music, she is also known for her tumultuous personal life. The singer was a single mom at the age of 15 and is the mother of five, her website said. Rivera's ""I Love Jenni"" reality show began airing on Telemundo's mun2 network last year. She is a judge on the popular TV show ""The Voice Mexico,"" which was scheduled to air Sunday night on Televisa. Noting its concern for Rivera, Televisa said it would air a special report on the singer instead. ""To all her fans who are suffering, I say thank you, and don't suffer. Soon we will have news of her,"" Rosa Rivera said. CNN's Jaqueline Hurtado and CNNMexico.com contributed to this report.","Remains have been found at the site where Jenni Rivera's plane is believed to have crashed .

"Newtown, Connecticut (CNN) -- The return to school after the summer break is an annual milestone in every child's life. But as the school buses pulled up to take more than 5,000 children back to class in Newtown, Connecticut, Tuesday, it was far from an ordinary day. The returning students were greeted not only by their teachers but also the presence of more armed guards -- and with them a solemn reminder of the tragedy that struck their town last year. Mark and Jackie Barden are among those for whom the back-to-school ritual will be hardest. While their children Natalie, 11, and James, 13, are returning to class as they have each year, their youngest child, 7-year-old Daniel, is not. He was one of 20 young children killed during the horrific shooting spree inside Newtown's Sandy Hook Elementary School last December. Six teachers were also killed by Adam Lanza, 20, who then took his own life. ""This will be our first time back to school without Daniel,"" said his father, Mark. The family's pain is still raw -- and it's hard not to imagine how it would have been to see their boy going off to second grade. ""It's still day to day, and we have better days than others,"" his mother said. Sandy Hook Elementary is being torn down and its students will head Tuesday to Chalk Hill Elementary instead, the site to which they moved when classes resumed in January. The heightened security they will find there will be replicated in schools across the district. Opinion: Does your child's school have a security plan? Armed security . The school board is doing everything it can to put families at ease in the wake of last year's shooting and the recent gun scare in Georgia. Steps taken include better locks on doors, real-time monitoring systems and more armed guards at every school. ""It's not a normal back-to-school but we're trying to put the resources in place to make it as normal as possible,"" said Debbie Leidlein, who chairs the education board. ""Parents will definitely see armed security at each school and there will be additional guards at multiple schools."" The number of guards present will depend on the size of the school and number of students, she added. More safety measures are expected to be put in place in Newtown schools over the course of the school year, but officials did not go into detail. It's not just Newtown where the security of children and their educators is at the forefront of people's minds. School districts across the country are adding more security guards, particularly to their elementary schools. At least three states have also passed laws recently allowing teachers to be able to carry handguns on campus. For the Bardens, the daily struggle to carry on family life without Daniel continues. What they'd like to see are positive changes in the way people act, such as showing more kindness to others, to try to prevent others suffering a similar loss. ""We have to try to do the good work that he was supposed to do here,"" said Mark. ""We're gonna try our best to do it for him.""

"(CNN) -- Just days after an 8-year-old boy shot and killed his grandmother after playing video games, a Louisiana judge said Monday the child can continue to live with his family. Under state law in Louisiana, where the shooting occurred, the child cannot be charged. ""He's distraught. It's really taken a toll on him. He looks visibly shaken,"" said East Feliciana Parish District Attorney Samuel D'Aquilla. ""It was determined that he did the shooting and it was an accident. He thought it was a toy gun, a play gun,"" D'Aquilla told CNN. ""It's not a crime if he's under 10 years old. We're still trying to figure out how to help this juvenile and his parents,"" the district attorney added. The child is not being publicly identified. In a closed proceeding Monday, the district attorney asked for a court hearing to begin the process to get whatever help is available to the family and to the child. The family told the court that the boy is getting counseling. The boy is expected to enter a state program called Families in Need of Services, or FINS, according to D'Aquilla. FINS is a Louisiana state program not associated with the criminal justice system. ""We presented evidence today and the judge said the child can live with his mother and father,"" said D'Aquilla. ""It's not a bad environment. They have two other children,"" he said. Last Thursday, Marie Smothers, 87, was caring for the boy at her residence in a mobile home park in Slaughter, Louisiana. Smothers was watching television in the living area and the boy was playing the video came Grand Theft Auto IV on another television set behind her just minutes before the incident, according to a news release from the East Feliciana Parish Sheriff's Department. The gun was a .38-caliber handgun, according to the sheriff's department. ""The gun was in a pouch or a purse. where he could obviously pick it up,"" said District Attorney D'Aquilla. ""He shot her from about three or four feet away, according to the autopsy,"" he said. The boy's grandmother was the mother of the child's father, according to a statement from the sheriff's department. 10 most controversial violent video games . ""By accounts of relatives of the victim, as well as friends of the family, the victim and the juvenile had a normal, loving relationship and even shared the same bedroom,"" D'Aquilla said. Because the child is only 8 years old, he does not even fall under Louisiana's juvenile justice system, which is meant for offenders starting at age 10. So, by entering the FINS program, officials say, it is generally hoped that the family and the boy can get any help they will need. ""The family can be put under a plan of counseling or other types of services and they can also get supervision at that time,"" said Martha Morgan, chief counsel for the Louisiana Office of Juvenile Justice. ""We try to get them the services they need to keep them from becoming juvenile delinquents,"" she told CNN. The next hearing in the case has been scheduled for September 10.","The 87-year-old woman was caring for her grandson, 8 .

"Washington (CNN) -- There's a new panda in Washington. Officials at the Smithsonian's National Zoo confirmed the arrival of a cub on Friday for Mei Xiang following a quick labor. DC's new celebrity resident was about the size of a butter stick and zoo officials said it appeared to be doing well, as was mom, who was cradling it in her den. ""This is a very delicate time for us. We're still on the lookout for a possible second cub,"" the zoo's director, Dennis Kelly, said at a news conference. There was a 50% chance of a twin being born later Friday or early on Saturday. A healthy little panda would be extra special because the female cub that Mei Xiang delivered nearly a year ago died within days. A lack of oxygen due to underdeveloped lungs was determined as the cause. Zoo officials said they were pleased and hopeful things would work out this time, and they even brought in an expert from China to help out. ""After our last experience, and this is such a small cub, I am not going to relax,"" Kelly said. ""We're gong to be tense for the next two or three months. We have high hopes."" It will take two to three weeks to know the sex of the cub and zoo officials won't name it for 100 days, following Chinese tradition. Zoo babies and other intriguing critters . Conceived through artificial insemination, it was the third pregnancy for Mei Xiang, 15. The National Zoo says the cub's father is either their own Tian Tian, 15, or the San Diego Zoo's Gao Gao, who is about 23. All three pandas are on loan from China. Mei Xiang and Tian Tian are already the parents of Tai Shan, who was born in 2005 and now is in China, the native region for the endangered animals. American zoo officials are consulting with their Chinese counterparts about panda reproduction and ways to encourage newborns to thrive in captivity. China launches 24/7 live panda broadcast . The giant panda is one of the world's most endangered species, with an estimated 1,900 in existence.

"(RS.com) -- Mitch Hurwitz has good news for ""Arrested Development"" fans. ""I'm working on the movie right now,"" the show's creator tells Rolling Stone. ""I can't get into much more detail because I don't want to scare anybody off. I don't want to be presumptuous about it. I don't own the property outright -- it's a 20th Century Fox property. But everybody seems really into it and really eager to make a movie."" Binge-watching 'Arrested Development' season four . The biggest challenge that Hurwitz faced when filming the fourth season last year was working around the busy schedules of the large cast. ""A TV season is a six-month commitment,"" he says. ""But I think it would be very doable to get them together for four or five weeks to make a movie."" Any sort of ""Arrested Development"" movie has yet to receive a green light, so Hurwitz is very reluctant to guess when it might see release. ""I'm hoping it happens as soon as possible,"" he says. ""But I want to be very careful about not putting out false information. I want to get a time and tell everybody when it's happening and not play with people. Right now, I'm trying to do something else for Netflix and a movie project and things. I'm always sort of superstitious about talking about this stuff before it happens. It's the best way to guarantee it doesn't happen."" ""Arrested Development"" returned as a Netflix-only show in May after being off the air for seven years. It got a ton of media attention, but some fans and critics were disappointed by the end result. ""I was really aware that we were trying to do something that not only had nobody done before, but we didn't really tell anybody what we were going to do,"" says Hurwitz. ""That is, we made an eight-and-a-half-hour show. So nobody had any framework to watch it from."" The 15 new episodes largely focused on one character at a time. The same scene was often shown from many different perspectives, and jokes sometimes didn't pay off for several episodes. Netflix eyes another season of 'Arrested Development' ""By now, many people have gone through the episodes again,"" says Hurwitz. ""They see the first episodes as the first chapters as opposed to the first episodes. People responding quickly to the first episodes was akin to reading a couple chapters of a book and saying, 'I don't like this.'"" Some of the online reaction to the new episodes was hostile, but Hurwitz steered clear of the countless reviews and recaps. ""When we originally did the show there was a website called Television Without Pity,"" he says. ""I would oftentimes go there and see reactions to the previous night's show. It was really interesting. They'd write things like, 'Now they're doing black puppets! They've ruined the show!' It doesn't matter what people like now. The first Monday after we aired on Sunday, they hated it. And then six months later, people would say, 'Why don't they do good shows like they did with [the black puppet] Franklin?' Realistically, if you're going to really try to do something different and confound expectations, you're going to lose some people and gain some people."" 'Arrested Development': The funniest running jokes . The reaction to the new episodes reminds Hurwitz of what Radiohead experienced in 2000. ""There was a long lapse of time after they released 'OK Computer,'"" he says. ""And then 'Kid A' came out and everybody was like, 'We don't like this. We don't like this.' And then later they came around to thinking it was even better than 'OK Computer.' Also, it's difficult to make this comparison because it sounds self-aggrandizing and I don't mean it that way, but I remember when 'The Godfather II' came out. People were like, 'What? What is this? I want to see 'The Godfather' where they shoot people, not this thing where they talk about Cuba.'"" Plans are obviously in flux at the moment, but Hurwitz's ultimate goal is to make an ""Arrested Development"" movie and then another season of the show. ""The whole thing is sort of unprecedented,"" he says. ""It's always been its own little thing. I kind of feel like the more it stays original, the better chance it has. As soon as it goes back to trying to do exactly what it was before, you run the risk of doing a reunion show or something."" See the original story on RollingStone.com.

"(CNN) -- The cast of the upcoming film ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" made a surprise appearance at Comic-Con this afternoon along with director Bryan Singer. The cast members who appeared include those from the original ""X-Men"" movie franchise and those from 2011's X-Men reboot ""X:Men: First Class."" Jennifer Lawrence, Michael Fassbender, James McEvoy, Patrick Stewart, Halle Berry, Ian McKellen, Ellen Page, Peter Dinklage, Nicholas Hoult, Hugh Jackman, Evan Peters, Shawn Ashmore and Omar Sy assembled in Hall H to debut footage from the film. Dinklage has been rumored to be playing the villain in the film since photos from the set leaked earlier this summer, but at first the ""Game of Thrones"" actor wouldn't confirm his role. ""I'm playing Mystique,"" he joked. He later officially confirmed his participation by saying, ""I get to play Bolivar Trask."" Singer directed 2000's ""X-Men"" and 2003's ""X2,"" and produced 2009's ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine."" The director set up this new film in the series, which will be released in theaters on May 23, 2014, explaining the character of Wolverine (Jackman) will be the central figure bringing the story together. The upcoming ""Wolverine"" film out next week will act as a bridge for the character, Jackman said. Another can of ""Kick-Ass"" ""The goal was to try and make a film that would bring this cast together by time travel or time displacement of some kind,"" Singer said. ""Basically, the notion is that consciousness of Wolverine of the future is sent into his past self. And it was nice because Hugh was able to play both parts because the character of Wolverine is ageless. And it was great to be able to place him as a character in both these worlds. For me, it was great to reunite the old cast and get to work as a director with the new cast."" Singer also addressed rumors that this new film will rewrite the movie universe he's set up in prior films, specifically changing some of the events from ""X2."" ""Whenever you're going back in time -- and this is every bit as much a time travel movie as it is an X-Men movie -- there is those risks,"" Singer said. ""I'm not the audience, I'm just the filmmaker, but I do believe in certain continuity that we'll maintain and some things we'll change. When you go back and mess about, things happen. So some of those rumors are probably somewhat true."" Superman vs. Batman, friends or foes? There will be some interaction between the older and younger versions of the characters, according to Singer. The director screened a reel of film footage that included a teaser of that. ""Wolverine is the journeyman,"" Singer said. ""His interaction with the younger cast is primary. There is a moment, which you'll see in this reel, where these characters come face to face, older self with younger self. And we tried to do it in a unique way. It's been done before, but with my first opportunity to make a time travel film I want to create this set of rules and stay with them."" One of the big surprises is that Professor Charles Xavier (Stewart) is still alive after the events of 2006's ""X-Men: The Last Stand."" In that film, the character of Jean Grey killed Xavier -- mostly. Metallica promotes new film . ""My assumption was that it was going to be Ian and Halle and Hugh and everybody back, but it won't be me,"" Stewart said. ""But something happened, which I'm not allowed to talk about -- am I?"" In my own mind I understand how Xavier is alive at the end of 'X-Men 3,'"" Singer responded. ""At the end of 'X-Men 3' after the credits when his consciousness is inside of this woman in a hospital and you take that and mix it with some powerful mutants -- mutants can do a lot of cool stuff -- you can imagine that anything is possible."" The film takes place during several time periods, including the 1970s, which allowed for some interesting costume choices beyond the X-Men suits. ""I personally love the moments when I get to wear the '70s clothes,"" said Lawrence, who (really) plays Mystique. ""I really enjoy them because I love that time and I like wearing clothes when I can. Some of the Mystique stuff, some of the look is a little bit different. We're still using the same paint. When we left the (last) movie, she was mutant and proud. She was kind of struggling with the problem that a lot of normal human people struggle with, which is how they look. So she was very covered up in the first movie, but this time she is mutant and proud."" ""It's a very collaborative thing,"" Fassbender added. ""That's a thing that I've found as a whole: The clothes we wear, the Magneto outfit, being on set."" ""The best thing about playing the older Magneto this time -- no helmet,"" McKellen said, telling Fassbender, ""We'll talk about helmets later."" The cast members also discussed their ongoing friendships. One of the benefits of the film was bringing the original cast members back together and for Berry, who plays Storm, this film was a chance to reunite with old friends. ""We all love the films, but what's nice for me is that in the first movie we all became such good friends,"" Berry said. ""And we really like each other and we like being around each other so to have a chance to do the work and hang out with the people we really respect, admire and like to be around is the joy of coming back to do these movies. The beauty is we pick up as if we just saw each other yesterday. I was really happy to see everybody and meet the new cast.""","The full cast of X-Men reunited at Comic-Con .

"Washington (CNN) -- A Pentagon official said he believes the shooting early Tuesday at the U.S. Defense Department headquarters was a ""random incident."" ""We are looking at all the possibilities,"" Steven E. Calvery, director of the Pentagon Force Protection Agency, said at a news conference late Tuesday morning. ""What we have is an isolated incident, so far."" Pentagon police officers, as well as several construction workers in the area, heard at least five shots fired around 4:50 a.m., Pentagon officials said. As of midday Tuesday, authorities had discovered two bullet fragments in third- and fourth-floor windows on the south side of the building, said Calvery. That part of the Pentagon was empty at the time of the shooting, as it is in the process of being renovated. The bullets shattered but did not go through the windows, which are bulletproof, according to Calvery. The incident prompted a 40-minute shutdown of the entire Pentagon, and authorities conducted an interior sweep of the building shortly after 6 a.m. Calvery said authorities were unsure who fired the shots and with what kind of gun, though he said he believes they came from a rifle. A portion of Interstate 395 -- which runs along the south side of the Pentagon -- was also shut down temporarily to conduct a search in the investigation. Maj. Chris Perrine, a public affairs officer for Defense Press Operations, said that other temporary road closures may be necessary as the probe continues. Several law enforcement agencies, including the FBI and Pentagon police, are looking at surveillance footage and doing ballistics tests of the bullets found thus far, among other measures. Tuesday's shooting follows a similar incident overnight Sunday at the National Museum of the Marine Corps in Triangle, Virginia, near the entrance of Marine Corps Base Quantico. Lin Ezell, the museum's director, told CNN Tuesday that investigators have determined that one or more assailants used rifles to fire 10 bullets at the building -- five hitting glass windows, the rest hitting metal panels. Authorities haven't pinned down exactly where the shots were fired from, though they believe they came from Interstate 95 or nearby. No one was hurt in that incident, which occurred between 12:15 a.m. and 5 a.m. when the building was unoccupied, Ezell said. No one has claimed responsibility and there were no known threats prior to the shooting, she added. Military police and the Prince William County Police Department are investigating that incident. Asked if there were any ties between that and the Pentagon shootings, a law enforcement official said that ""except for the similarity in the incidents -- windows shot out at military facilities -- there is nothing to connect these incidents at this point."" Both shots appeared to have been fired from high-velocity rifles, the official said. But the FBI, which is helping with ballistics tests related to the Pentagon shooting, has yet to see evidence from the Marine Museum shooting. Tuesday's shooting was the first such incident at the U.S. Defense Department headquarters since March, when John Patrick Bedell pulled a gun from his pocket and began shooting. Bedell, who had a history of mental health problems, was later shot and killed, while two Pentagon police officers received superficial injuries in the incident.

"(CNN) -- If you're sick of cheerful, happy people, it might be wise to avoid Hawaii or Napa, California. They were found to be the United States' happiest state and city, respectively, in a recent study of geotagged tweets. Researchers at the University of Vermont sifted through more than 10 million geotagged tweets from 2011 to map out the moods of Americans in urban areas. They ranked the locations based on frequency of positive and negative words using the Mechanical Turk Language Assessment word list. The list includes 10,000 words that have been rated on a scale 1 to 10 according to how ""happy"" they are. On the lower end of the scale are negative words such as mad, hate, no, boo, smoke and jail, as well as a colorful and thorough assortment of expletives. Happy words include the omnipresent LOL and haha, as well as good, nice, sleep and wine, and food or beach related words. According to the list, rainbow is one of the happiest words and earthquake is one of the saddest. Maine, Nevada, Utah and Vermont round-out the top five happiest states list, following rainbow and beach-filled Hawaii. Louisiana was found to be the saddest state, followed by Mississippi, Maryland, Michigan and Delaware. One reason for Louisiana's low cheeriness ranking (they must not have measured during Mardi Gras) is its inhabitants' fondness for profanity. The study, which was broken down by The Atlantic, also looked at the results for 373 urban areas to rank the happiest and least-happy cities. Vacation destination Napa, California, was determined to be one of the happiest cities along with Longmont, Colorado; San Clemente, California; Santa Fe, New Mexico; and Santa Cruz, California. The five most bummed-out cities according to average word choices were Beaumont, Texas; Albany, Georgia; Texas City, Texas; Shreveport, Louisiana; and Monroe, Louisiana. Again, researchers found liberal use of swear words to be a key factor in a city's overall happiness score. Coastal areas were more chipper than landlocked areas, and the cities with a higher density of tweets tended to be less happy. ""This suggests that cities with high technology adoption rates (as most geotagged tweets come from devices like smartphones) are in fact less happy than their less technological counterparts,"" says the study. The researchers took their results and compared them against census data and found that wealthy areas tended to have higher happiness levels and that areas with high rates of obesity has lower happiness levels. They looked at obesity rates and food words to create lists of low and high-obesity words. The terms McDonalds, wings, ham and heartburn were popular in high-obesity areas, while words such as cafe, sushi, brewery and banana were more common in low-obesity areas. The research shows that social networks have a lot of promise for these types of surveys, and also that there are still some major limitations. Researchers point out that only 15% of online adults are using Twitter, and those users don't accurately represent the demographics of the United States. The group will once again dig into tweets for even more research once the 2012 census data is released.","Twitter survey: Hawaii is the happiest state and Napa, California, is the happiest city .

"(CNN) -- A month after Major League Baseball suspended him for violating its drug policy, Ryan Braun says he's coming clean. The 29-year-old Milwaukee Brewers outfielder apologized in a statement released Thursday, saying he used a ""cream and a lozenge"" banned by the league. Braun did not specify which drug he used, but his suspension came after baseball's investigation into Biogenesis, the now-defunct Florida clinic accused of providing performance-enhancing drugs to baseball players. ""I have no one to blame but myself,"" Braun wrote. ""I know that over the last year and a half I made some serious mistakes, both in the information I failed to share during my arbitration hearing and the comments I made to the press afterwards. I have disappointed the people closest to me -- the ones who fought for me because they truly believed me all along. I kept the truth from everyone. For a long time, I was in denial and convinced myself that I had not done anything wrong."" This isn't the first time the 2011 National League MVP and five-time All-Star has said he's sorry and admitted wrongdoing. But his statement Thursday gave new details about what he did -- and why he did it. It all started when he was dealing with a ""nagging injury"" during the 2011 season, Braun said. ""I turned to products for a short period of time that I shouldn't have used. The products were a cream and a lozenge which I was told could help expedite my rehabilitation,"" he said. ""It was a huge mistake for which I am deeply ashamed and I compounded the situation by not admitting my mistakes immediately."" An ESPN report in June named Braun as one of more than a dozen players facing suspension due to a scandal involving performance-enhancing drugs. Last month, MLB Commission Bud Selig announced that Braun had been suspended without pay for the rest of the 2013 season. League and union officials praised him for taking responsibility for his actions. At the time, Braun apologized in a statement, saying ""I am not perfect."" Braun was the 2007 National League Rookie of the Year and by the 2011 season, he was considered the cornerstone of the Brewers franchise. He signed a five-year, $105 million contract extension and went on to help lead the Brewers to the playoffs for the only the fourth time in team history. His performance earned him that year's National League MVP award. Shortly after his amazing season, however, a urine sample taken during the playoffs tested positive for an elevated level of testosterone. Faced with a 50-game suspension, Braun appealed the decision, and an arbitrator overturned the suspension on what some, including the chief executive of the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, said was a technicality. Braun said Thursday that feelings of anger and self-righteousness fueled his public comments after the arbitrator's decision in February 2012. At the time, he criticized the process, described himself as a victim, claimed that he was innocent and stressed that truth was on his side. ""I felt wronged and attacked, but looking back now, I was the one who was wrong,"" Braun said Thursday. ""I am beyond embarrassed that I said what I thought I needed to say to defend my clouded vision of reality. I am just starting the process of trying to understand why I responded the way I did, which I continue to regret. There is no excuse for any of this."" CNN's David Close contributed to this report.","Ryan Braun gives details about what he did -- and why .

"(CNN) -- A New Jersey man tells authorities his idea to create a fictional woman online, and then to report she'd been ""kidnapped"" in Bulgaria was just a joke. But the feds aren't laughing. Andriy Mykhaylivskyy, 18, of Bergen County, New Jersey, was arrested Tuesday and charged with making false statements to a United States official, according to Matthew Reilly at the U.S. attorney's office in New Jersey. Mykhaylivskyy allegedly created a fake online persona named Kate Brianna Fulton and proceeded to initiate a year-long online relationship between ""Kate"" and one of his male high school classmates, according to the criminal complaint. In July, he contacted a U.S. Embassy in Eastern Europe to report that Kate had been kidnapped in Bulgaria and was being held for $50,000 ransom. The high school friend, who was not in on the ruse, called Bulgaria himself and had two tweets from Kate's Twitter account including one that said, ""Someone help me."" It was enough to launch a search of hotels and hostels in one Bulgarian town by authorities there. But there was no kidnapped Kate to be found in Bulgaria -- because there was no Kate. Through online investigations, authorities traced Kate back to Mykhaylivskyy, who admitted the ""joke"" in an interview with State Department investigators earlier this month, according to authorities.. Mykhaylivskyyy was in federal court in Newark Tuesday, where his bail was set at $5,000 with the condition that he only use the Internet for educational purposes and that he continue school.

"New York (CNN) -- The British tourist who was struck by a New York City taxi after it jumped a curb had her left leg amputated below the knee, hospital officials said Thursday. Sian Green, 23, was at 49th Street and Sixth Avenue -- home to Rockefeller Center and near Radio City Music Hall and Saks Fifth Avenue -- Tuesday morning when she and a bicyclist were both hit by the cab after the driver swerved onto the curb, authorities said. Given the condition of the lower leg, ""replantation was not an option,"" according to Dr. Spiros G. Frangos of Bellevue Hospital. Green's right leg sustained multiple injuries but will likely regain most functionality with time and physical therapy, the trauma surgeon said in a statement. Green's parents released a statement on Thursday, expressing their gratitude to all those that helped during this ""difficult time."" ""We hope Sian will soon be on her way to recovery and will be able to personally thank all the kind people of New York City,"" they said. TV's Dr. Mehmet Oz, host of ""The Dr. Oz Show,"" was nearby at the time of the accident and rushed over to assist, according to show rep Tim Sullivan. A good Samaritan walking by also aided Green. ""David Justino, a plumber from New York, took action, removing his belt and using it as a tourniquet,"" Oz said in a Facebook post.

"(CNN) -- Heavy rain, hilly terrain and inadequate equipment slowed efforts to recover hundreds of people feared killed by a massive landslide in eastern Uganda, officials said Thursday. About 300 people were missing and feared dead after Monday's landslide, including 100 students, said Catherine Ntabadde, a spokeswoman for the Ugandan Red Cross Society. At least 87 bodies had been recovered, she said. Officials have lowered the death toll, from 106, since Tuesday. ""We found some body parts, which we have decided not to count as a whole for now,"" said Musa Ecweru, the minister for disaster preparedness. Hundreds of rescuers, including the nation's military, used shovels and hoes to dig through the mud in a desperate search for survivors. Residents from nearby villages joined in, some armed with garden tools, while others used their bare hands. Have you been affected by the mudslides? Share your images, video . ""It's impossible to take bulldozers and any heavy equipment to the site. The earth is very delicate and heavy machinery may cause more landslides,"" Ntabadde said. The terrain also is inaccessible by road, Ecweru said. The area is so steep that evacuees are walking about 6 miles (10 kilometers) to nearby camps. The Red Cross, United Nations and World Food Program are helping provide food, water and other essentials, such as blankets, to the displaced, officials said. They've also set up mobile clinics to provide medical care. Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni flew to the site of the landslide Wednesday and attended a funeral for victims. A select few attended the service, because of the risk of more landslides, Ecweru said. Museveni ordered the nearly 4,000 people living nearby to be evacuated to permanent locations in less hilly terrain. The chances of finding survivors were fading as heavy rain pounded the area, leaving rescuers focusing on recovery efforts, the Red Cross spokeswoman said. ""We have not found anyone alive today,"" Ntabadde said. ""We don't expect to find any more people alive."" Most of the bodies were recovered from a hospital engulfed by the landslide after residents sought shelter, officials said. ""The villages of Nametsi, Namakansa and Kubewo in Nametsi parish have been wiped out,"" Ntabadde said. The neighboring village of Bamuyaka in Bubita Sub County also has been affected. Flooding also has destroyed roads and washed away bridges in at least seven districts. The landslide occurred near Mount Elgon, on the Kenya-Uganda border.","About 300 people were missing and feared dead after Monday's landslide .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Few political trials can boast the intoxicating mix of sex, murder and exotic meat. But that's exactly what the case of former political kingpin Bo Xilai offered observers in China, many of whom -- more than half a million -- followed proceedings on social media courtesy of court officials in the eastern city of Jinan. It's not clear how closely the transcripts -- posted on Weibo, China's version of Twitter -- matched what happened in the courtroom, but the dramatic and often surreal detail that did emerge made for fascinating reading. Here are five of the highlights: . 1. Bo feared a woman scorned . Bo told the court he is the target of bitter payback by his wife, Gu Kailai, who is angry over an affair he had and is trying to implicate him in her shady business deals so she can avoid the death penalty. ""I feel affectionate about Gu. She's a fragile woman, and she would be convicted to death if she's found involved in economic crimes. Blaming it on someone else could be an easy way out,"" he said. Ouch. Gu is currently serving a suspended death sentence for murdering British businessman Neil Heywood by drugging him and pouring rat poison down his throat in a hotel room in November 2011. 2. The younger Bo likes Segways . For people who consider walking over-rated, these two-wheeled electronic bikes are a popular way to zoom around. According to Gu, her son wanted one so she advised him to speak to wealthy businessman Xu Ming, the chairman of conglomerate the Dalian Shide Group at the time. ""Ask Xu to pay for it,"" Gu said, according to her own testimony. ""He hasn't given you a gift for a while. Just say this is a gift that your mum can enjoy as well."" She mentioned that her husband, who is accused of taking bribes, knew about the gift and even tried it himself -- a claim he refuted. ""I have never had any idea of who bought the scooter. No one ever spoke to me about it."" But when the prosecutor showed Bo the scooter's picture and asked if he'd ever seen it before, he replied: ""Yes, I've seen it. But I had many things to worry about. How could I care about such a toy?"" 3. Bo likes to fly ... The Segway was not the only mode of transport laid on by Xu, according to testimony from family aide Zhang Xiaojun. It got far more extravagant. Zhang -- who is also serving time for Heywood's murder -- said he booked numerous flights for the younger Bo to and from China, the United Kingdom and the United States, where Bo was studying. The younger Bo also went to Germany in 2006 to watch the World Cup, as well as Venice, Argentina, Cuba, Paris and Africa. Not content with solo trips, Zhang said he also booked flights to China and hotel rooms for 40 of Bo's friends from Harvard University around mid-March 2011. Zhang said he phoned Xu's secretary to ask him to cover the cost of hotels in Beijing and internal flights in China. The prosecution said the cost of the trip -- over 3.2 million renminbi ($524,000) -- was expensed to the company account. 4. Bo was not familiar with biltong . The South African snack might not be to everyone's taste but there are certain rules and one is that it shouldn't be cooked. During Friday's proceedings, Gu told the court via video that their son, Bo Guagua, bought his father some meat as a present from Africa. ""It was a large chunk of meat, of a rare species. I couldn't remember what animal it came from,"" Gu said. Gu revealed that her son got very upset when his father insisted on steaming it. The snapshot of mealtime at the Bo's house set off a flurry of online speculation as to what the mysterious meat could be. After many netizens settled on biltong -- a type of cured meat including beef and game -- enterprising vendors listed the meat for sale online as ""Guagua's choice."" By Sunday, the ads had been pulled. 5. Some Chinese policeman are tall . Before some of the more intriguing details of trial emerged, the stature of the policemen guarding Bo became a subject of fevered online speculation. Where on earth did Chinese officials find officers tall enough to tower over Bo, who himself stands over six foot? That mystery remains unsolved. CNN's David McKenzie and Dayu Zhang contributed to this report.","Bo Xilai awaiting verdict on charges of corruption, embezzlement, abuse of power .

"(CNN) -- Finally, we have a new arrival. No, not the royal baby. A corpse flower. The titan arum (Amorphophallus titanum) at the United States Botanic Garden Conservatory finally started blooming and stinking like rotting flesh on Sunday around 4 p.m. It may remain in bloom for 24 to 48 hours, and then it will collapse quickly. The plant, which has lived at the garden since 2007, doesn't have an annual blooming cycle. This is its first-ever cycle, and dedicated fans might wait years or decades between cycles. The garden is open from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Monday. If you can't make it to the nation's capital, watch it online on the garden's live flower cam. Once the garden confirmed on July 8 that the plant was going to bloom, staffers moved quickly to display it publicly on July 11. Summer in the park: Roam with the bison . The plant tends to heat up, starts smelling stinky and usually blooms overnight or in the early morning hours. The heat and smell are to attract pollinator insects such as dung beetles in its natural habitat, said Ari Novy, the garden's public programs manager. The garden doesn't have any such beetles, but resident flies may visit, he said. A native of Sumatra, Indonesia, this particular plant is part of the garden's collection of 14 corpse flowers. They are rarely put on display because they require a lot of heat and humidity, which is why they are grown at the garden's production greenhouses in Southeast Washington -- rarely open to the public. The U.S. Botanic Garden last displayed a blooming titan arum in 2007. At least seven U.S. institutions have at least one titan arum in their collections. The National Botanic Garden of Belgium saw its oldest corpse flower bloom earlier this month, attracting about 4,000 visitors over three days, said garden spokesman Franck Hidvegi. It previously bloomed in 2008 and 2011. The garden has another four plants in its greenhouses, but Hidvegi said they are still too young to bloom.","A corpse flower at the U.S. Botanic Garden has started blooming for the first time ever .

"(CNN) -- A broad coalition of groups supporting everything from religion, drugs, and digital rights to guns and the environment sued the National Security Agency today, demanding a federal judge immediately halt what they are calling an ""unconstitutional program of dragnet electronic surveillance"" stemming from the government's vast collection of Americans' phone-calling data. The lawsuit (.pdf), lodged in San Francisco federal court, is at least the fourth challenging the government's wholesale phone surveillance program first disclosed by the Guardian newspaper, which last month began publishing documents leaked to the media outlet by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. Lawmakers at first appeared outraged by the disclosure and held hearings. But that fervor had quickly dissipated, and Congress has seemingly turned a blind eye to the surveillance that all the lawsuits — from San Francisco to the District of Columbia — seek to halt. ""Defendants' collection of telephone communications information includes, but is not limited to, recordings indicating who each customer communicates with, at what time, for how long and with what frequency communications occur. This communications information discloses the expressive and private associational connections among individuals and groups, including Plaintiffs and their members and staff,"" according to the suit, which is being ligated by the Electronic Frontier Foundation and others. ""This lawsuit challenges an illegal and unconstitutional program of dragnet electronic surveillance, specifically the bulk acquisition, collection, storage, retention, and searching of telephone communications information,"" the suit said. The Guardian in June posted a leaked copy of a top secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court opinion requiring Verizon Business to provide the NSA the phone numbers of both parties involved in all calls, the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) number for mobile callers, calling card numbers used in the call, and the time and duration of the calls. The law that has been authorizing the surveillance is the Patriot Act — adopted six weeks after the 2001 terror attacks — and greatly expanded the government's power to intrude into the private lives of Americans. The suit names one of the most controversial provisions of the Patriot Act — Section 215 — that allows the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to authorize broad warrants for most any type of records, including those held by banks, doctors and phone companies. Lawmakers have repeatedly voted to prevent the act from expiring. The government only needs to show that the information is ""relevant"" to an authorized investigation. No connection to a terrorist or spy is required. The suit says the spying as outlined by the Guardian and confirmed by the government breaches the constitutional rights of the plaintiffs. Among other things, it chills their First Amendment speech rights and breaches the Fourth Amendment because the secret court is authorizing the surveillance against Americans without particularized suspicion that they have engaged in any criminal, terrorist activity. ""The Program collects information concerning all calls wholly within the United States, including local telephone calls, as well as all calls between the United States and abroad, regardless of a connection to international terrorism, reasonable suspicion of criminality, or any other form of wrongdoing,"" according to the suit, signed by Cindy Cohn, the EFF's legal director. The suit names the National Security Agency; NSA Director Keith Alexander, Attorney General Eric Holder; Federal Bureau of Investigation; FBI Director Robert Mueller; and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and others. The plaintiffs include: First Unitarian Church of Los Angeles; Bill of Rights Defense Committee; Calguns Foundation; California Association of Federal Firearms Licensees; Council on Islamic Relations; Franklin Armory; Free Press; Free Software Foundation; Greenpeace; Human Rights Watch; Media Alliance; National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws; Open Technology Institute; People for the American Way, Public Knowledge; Students for Sensible Drug Policy; TechFreedom; and Unitarian Universalist Service Committee. The government has repeatedly maintained that Americans have no constitutional privacy rights connected to their business records with the phone company. Meantime, the Electronic Privacy Information Center has taken a different legal path and has asked the Supreme Court to stop the program under virtually the same allegations. The American Civil Liberties Union has done the same in a New York federal court. Larry Klayman, the former chairman of Judicial Watch, has lodged a suit challenging the surveillance in a District of Columbia federal court. The government has yet to officially answer the allegations in court, but is expected to respond later this week in the ACLU challenge.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Taliban militants beheaded two children in southern Afghanistan, a provincial governor's office said. The beheadings occurred in Kandahar province, the provincial governor's office said Monday. One of those slain was a 10-year-old boy. The other was age 16. A press release issued by the office said the militants caught and beheaded the 10-year-old Sunday after he had collected food waste from a trash bin in the area of a security checkpoint. There were no immediate details about the 16-year-old. The Taliban denied any involvement in the beheadings, according to spokesman Qari Yousuf Ahmadi. He said Taliban fighters would never do such a thing, but said the group's civilian casualty commission would investigate. Insurgents have carried out frequent attacks on security forces across Afghanistan in recent months amid a spring offensive by the Taliban. Earlier today, Taliban fighters armed with guns and explosives clashed with security forces after taking over a building near the airport in the Afghan capital of Kabul. The fighting ended with all seven attackers dead, Afghan officials said. The Taliban said the attack was intended to target Americans in Kabul International Airport, one part of which is used by military forces and another by civilians, the officials said. In eastern Afghanistan, a service member with NATO's International Security Assistance Force died in a bombing on Monday, the latest in a string of coalition deaths.

"Rio de Janeiro (CNN) -- Security for Pope Francis' visit to Brazil has been raised after an incident involving his motorcade, a Brazilian federal official told CNN. The papal visit is now classified at the highest level of security -- it was raised to ""high risk"" from ""medium risk"" after his car got stuck in a crowd of enthusiastic followers Monday, the official said. The source says the problem in part stemmed from the pope instructing drivers not to avoid crowds. After Francis arrived in Brazil on Monday, he got into a silver hatchback Fiat for the drive from the airport to downtown Rio de Janeiro. Along the route, the vehicle became pinned between a bus and a crush of well-wishers who were reaching into the car to touch the pope. Federal authorities are now taking a larger role in Francis' security during his time in Brazil. Hundreds of thousands of pilgrims from around the globe have come to Rio for World Youth Day, a weeklong festival held every two years. The Vatican told reporters that 500,000 people came to Copacabana Beach for the opening ceremony and Mass. Crowds stretched down the beach for more than half a mile from the main stage. Brazil: Police found, destroyed bomb before pope's visit . A call for hope . The pope traveled Wednesday morning to the town of Aparecida, the site of a shrine to Our Lady of Aparecida, a clay statue of the Virgin Mary and one of the patron saints of Brazil. A large crowd -- braving rain -- cheered as the pope emerged from the helicopter that took him to the site, where he held Mass. In his homily, the pope called on the faithful to find hope in God. ""It is true that nowadays, to some extent, everyone, including our young people, feels attracted by the many idols which take the place of God and appear to offer hope: money, success, power, pleasure,"" Francis said. ""Often, a growing sense of loneliness and emptiness in the hearts of many people leads them to seek satisfaction in these ephemeral idols."" His was an upbeat message, encouraging ""openness to being surprised by God"" and proclaiming that ""Christians cannot be pessimists."" The pope also announced that he will return to Brazil in 2017, the 300th anniversary of the apparition of Our Lady of Aparecida to three fishermen. Singing priests revive Catholic Church in Brazil .

"San Diego (CNN) -- Here is an unlikely duel: It's Jeb Bush, former Florida governor and possible 2016 GOP presidential hopeful, vs. Matt Damon, actor and activist. The topic: School accountability measures that rely on high-stakes testing to determine which students are learning, which educators are teaching and which schools are working. Bush supports the tests, Damon opposes them. More on how their paths crossed in a minute. First, take it from someone who taught for four years as a substitute teacher in my old school district in Central California and who has written about education reform for more than two decades: Many educators don't want to advertise to the world how well their students are doing academically because, from there, it's a short walk to grading teacher performance. That is what accountability is all about. You probably have it in your job. I have it in mine. But a lot of public school teachers want nothing to do with it. Accountability includes the No Child Left Behind law, which set forth the radical proposition that all students should be at grade level in math and reading by 2014. The law also broke down testing data according to race and ethnicity, so minority communities could see how well the public schools in their neighborhoods are serving their students.Â . Enter Damon, whose mother, Nancy Carlsson-Paige, is a professor of early childhood education at Lesley University in Boston. Damon is himself a product of public schools, a fact that he eagerly shared with the crowd of teachers that he addressed in Washington in July 2011 as part of a protest called ""Save Our Schools."" The protesters had gathered because they were upset with the Obama administration, which has picked up the mantle of high-stakes testing from its predecessor through its own education reform initiative, ""Race to the Top."" In his remarks, Damon looked back fondly on his own educational experience while criticizing high-stakes testing and other school accountability measures. ""As I look at my life today,"" he told the crowd, ""the things I value most about myself -- my imagination, my love of acting, my passion for writing, my love of learning, my curiosity -- all come from how I was parented and taught. And none of these qualities that I've just mentioned -- none of these qualities that I prize so deeply, that have brought me so much joy, that have brought me so much professional success -- none of these qualities that make me who I am ... can be tested."" The crowd roared. More recently, Damon -- who grew up in the Boston area but now lives in the Los Angeles area -- has opened a can of worms by recently revealing to the Guardian newspaper that, his love for the public schools notwithstanding, he made other arrangements for his own kids. ""Sending our kids in my family to private school was a big, big, big deal,"" Damon said in the interview. ""And it was a giant family discussion. But it was a circular conversation, really, because ultimately we don't have a choice. I mean, I pay for a private education, and I'm trying to get the one that most matches the public education that I had, but that kind of progressive education no longer exists in the public system."" The public schools are not progressive enough? In Los Angeles? Really? So despite his fondness for public schools, the 42-year-old actor doesn't want his children anywhere near them. Oh, oh. This caught the attention of Jeb Bush, who last week took to Twitter to denounce Damon's hypocrisy. Jeb Bush (@JebBush) tweeted: . ""Matt Damon Refuses to Enroll Kids in Los Angeles Public Schools. Choice ok for Damon, why not everyone else?"" Fair? You bet. Damon has long been a cheerleader for the public schools, and so the actor deserved this spanking for his self-serving ""good enough for thee, but not for me"" defense of a public school system that he and his own family have abandoned. Others have said the same thing. Yet now it is Bush's turn to get spanked. The liberal media is already -- surprise -- attacking the Republican presidential contender in defense of the Hollywood celebrity. Some have even pointed out that Bush also sent his kids to private school and insisted that this makes the Republican the real hypocrite. I don't agree. Bush supports school choice and he practiced in his own family. Where's the inconsistency? The real issue in this story isn't the personalities. It's the policy. It was not smart of Damon to attack high-stakes testing -- especially since his own kids, because they attend private school, don't have to worry about how bad some of our public schools would be without the accountability measures that their daddy opposes so vehemently. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Ruben Navarrette: Testing is controversial but provides needed accountabiity in schools .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Newt Gingrich was the keynote speaker at Monday night's fundraising dinner for the Senate and House Republican campaign committees, but it was Sarah Palin who stole the show. Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin waves to the crowd at the Republican fundraising dinner Monday in Washington. The Alaska governor's last-minute appearance at the GOP's biggest fundraiser of the year ended 24 hours of speculation that the she might skip the event. A late attempt to have her speak at the dinner fell through when organizers feared she might upstage Gingrich, the onetime House speaker. Hours before the event was slated to begin, an aide to Palin would not confirm that she would be attending. But when Palin and her husband, Todd, sauntered across the stage with Gingrich and his wife, Callista, shortly before the program commenced, their appearance was met with cheers from the audience of 2,000 party loyalists. Sen. John McCain, who shared last year's Republican presidential ticket with Palin, greeted his former running mate as she made her way to her table. Soon after, the former GOP presidential nominee tweeted: ""Great to see Sarah and Todd at the dinner tonight -- nice reunion!"" Palin did not speak at the event, but during a break in the program for dinner, Republicans clustered around the former vice presidential nominee's table near the front of the ballroom, eager to meet the governor and pose for pictures.  Watch CNN's Candy Crowley report on the big evening » . It was the only table in the vast ballroom that had a crowd gathered around it -- and despite their distance from Palin's table, multiple television cameras kept their lenses trained on the governor for much of the night. The guest list included 33 Republican senators and Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele. Sen. John Cornyn, who as chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee helped organize the dinner, sat with Palin and her husband during the event. Cornyn briefly acknowledged Palin when he appeared on stage to thank his Republican colleagues for their work on behalf of the party. ""Thank you for being here with us tonight,"" Cornyn told her. ""Thank you for your leadership, we appreciate it every much."" Gingrich, the event headliner, also thanked Palin for attending. He said ""this country would be amazingly better off"" had McCain and Palin been elected. In a lengthy speech that touched on topics ranging from health care to border security, Gingrich railed against the Obama administration's ""disastrous"" approach to federal spending and national security policy. He acknowledged the intra-party squabbles that have roiled the Republican party since last year's election, but he said such debates are to be expected and will never really disappear. ""I am happy that Dick Cheney is a Republican,"" he said. ""I am also happy that Colin Powell is a Republican. A majority Republican Party will have lots of debates within the party. That is the nature of majorities."" Gingrich held up Cheney, the former vice president, as an expert voice on national security, and he called the White House's decision to engage Cheney on the national security issues ""the first big mistake"" of Obama's presidency. Pointing to last month's dueling national security speeches from Obama and Cheney, Gingrich said that Cheney laid out facts, while Obama resorted to little more than high-minded oratory. Gingrich said that like Reagan, Obama has brilliant rhetorical skills -- but unlike Reagan, he said, Obama ""uses his rhetorical skills to hide from fundamental facts.""  Watch Gingrich speak at dinner » . The dinner raised $14.45 million for congressional Republicans, money that will be split evenly between the Senate and House campaign committees as they seek to win back majorities in next year's midterm elections. In its most recent financial disclosure, the National Republican Congressional Committee reported $3.69 million in the bank and $5 million in debt. The NRSC, meanwhile, entered May debt-free and reported $2.69 million in its campaign war chest. Actor Jon Voight, an outspoken conservative who stars in the popular television series ""24,"" emceed the event.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A Bollywood star is facing a storm of controversy over the sex of his unborn child. India's Health Ministry has launched an investigation into media reports that the actor Shah Rukh Khan and his wife are expecting a boy through a surrogate mother. Sex determination tests are banned in India, and elsewhere in Asia, due to a traditional preference for sons. Dr Jignesh Thakkar of the Indian Radiological & Imaging Association told CNN that India's Health Ministry had investigated the case at the association's request. ""We wanted to know how this had been leaked out because it's confidential information that only a doctor and not even a patient knows,"" said Thakkar, who is the association's coordinator for the Pre-Conception Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques Act that bans sex selection. ""Action should be taken against the doctors and the patients who are not following this law. The celebrities or the rich and famous cannot get away with it."" Khan -- who has a 16-year-old son and 13-year-old daughter -- has not yet commented on the issue. Thakkar said that doctors proven to have divulged an unborn child's sex could face three years in jail and the suspension of their medical license for five years, while parents could face up to five years in jail. India banned sex detection in 1996 as it attempted to prevent the abortions of girls but, according to Rob Brooks at the University of New South Wales in Australia, this measure has had little impact on the country's skewed sex ratio. Sex detection tests are also illegal in China, another country where sex ratios are strongly biased toward males, but the ban has done little to correct the country's gender ratio, which in 2011 stood at 117 men for every 100 women. The global average is between 103 to 107 men per 100 women. ""It's not particularly effective because there are always unscrupulous doctors,"" he said. ""And ultrasound is a really important diagnostic technology so people go and get the ultrasound for other reasons and sometimes you can't help but notice the sex of the child."" Pakistan, Bangladesh, Iran, Afghanistan, Taiwan and South Korea also have unbalanced gender ratios, Brooks added. Brooks said that, in India, the preference for sons was historically confined to upper castes but as its economy has grown and the technology for sex selection made more widely available, the middle class had adopted the practice. In China, the preference is magnified by the country's one-child policy and campaigns to stress gender equality are undermined by provisions that allow families in rural areas to have a second child if the first is a girl. ""Rich people want to have a male heir to inherit the family fortune, while people in rural areas want strong manpower and farmers think boys can do more to the help the family,"" Zhang Zhongtang, an expert in family planning from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences told the Global Times in March. Brooks said that banning abortion for sex selection is just one small part of the measures needed to change attitudes, with improvements needed in women's rights to property ownership and better pension provision to reduce parents' reliance on their children along with reform to dowries and dowry like systems. But change is possible. Through legal reforms and a ""love your daughter"" public awareness campaign that highlighted the dangers of skewed sex ratios, South Korea managed to reduce its sex ratio at birth from 116 men per 100 women to 107 by 2007.","Health Ministry investigates reports Bollywood star and wife expecting a boy .

"(CNN) -- This summer's Superman blockbuster is getting a sequel -- and it's going to unite the Man of Steel with the Caped Crusader for the first time on the big screen. Warner Bros. Pictures announced Saturday at Comic-Con that Superman will pair with his fellow Justice League hero Batman in the upcoming yet-to-be-named film, expected to begin production in 2014. ""Man of Steel"" director Zack Snyder will direct the film, and current Superman Henry Cavill will star, Warner Bros. said. The new Batman has yet to be cast. Snyder's reimagining of Superman in ""Man of Steel"" broke the record for the biggest June opening, taking in $125.1 million in its first weekend. It has since raked in a total of $630 million worldwide, Warner Bros. said. ""Superman and Batman together on the big screen is a dream come true for DC (Comics) fans everywhere,"" said Diane Nelson, president of DC Entertainment. Snyder told Comic-Con fans he's excited to work with Cavill again and take the story to the next chapter. Metallica unveils film footage at Comic-Con . ""It's beyond mythological to have Superman and our new Batman facing off, since they are the greatest superheroes in the world,"" he said. Snyder strongly hinted that the heroes will be rivals in the movie. CNN partner Entertainment Weekly reported that ""Man of Steel"" actor Harry Lennix took the stage with Snyder and read a line from Frank Miller's 1986 book, ""The Dark Knight Returns,"" in which Batman wages battle with the man from Krypton. ""I want you to remember, Clark. In all the years to come. In all your most private moments. I want you to remember my hand at your throat. I want you to remember the one man who beat you,"" Lennix read from the book. Amy Adams, Laurence Fishburne and Diane Lane also return for the new film, Warner Bros. said. Another serving of ""Kick-Ass"" Christian Bale, who starred as Batman in three film installments of ""The Dark Knight,"" told Entertainment Weekly this month that he wouldn't be starring in a fourth. ""Dark Knight"" director Christopher Nolan also said he wasn't opting for a fourth movie in the franchise, the magazine said. Nolan will, however, have a hand in the upcoming Superman-Batman film -- he's serving as one of the executive producers, Warner Bros. said.

"(CNN) -- British actors David Bradley and Mark Gatiss arrived at the party of film ""The World's End"" together last night at Comic-Con to discuss their upcoming BBC film ""An Adventure In Space and Time."" But the pair also have another project in common now. Bradley, who plays Walder Frey on ""Game of Thrones,"" can now cite Gatiss as one of his fellow cast members on the show. Gatiss was recently announced to be joining the hit HBO series, but his role remains something of a surprise. ""I'm not allowed to tell you,"" Gatiss said. ""I've done my filming. I'm glad I didn't tell anyone before this since it's a big secret. The announcement of (my casting) was obviously timed for Comic-Con and I'm rather overwhelmed with the reaction, honestly.

""Once it's put together it looks like everybody must be there for weeks and weeks and weeks."" For Bradley, the past season of ""Game of Thrones"" was the most exciting for him.

"(CNN) -- Thanks to a wave of new mobile technology, I can store my calendar, car keys, credit cards, music and notes all on my smartphone. That kind of convergence is convenient, but my phone has an Achilles' heel. The battery doesn't last forever. Enter the Powerbag, a line of battery-equipped shoulder bags and backpacks made by RFA Brands. It's a smart backup for when gadgets inevitably need to take naps. I tested the Powerbag messenger bag for about a month, and I also spent a brief time using the backpack, which is very similar. On several instances during my tests, the bag proved useful on long trips or when traveling to conferences where I'm constantly making calls or doing e-mail. I had to overcome a couple of concerns before strapping on the Powerbag. For one, the idea of carrying a battery about the size of a deck of cards on my back in the rain is not comforting. And this line in the Powerbag manual's lengthy ""warnings"" section is not exactly reassuring: ""Improper use of this product may result in product damage, excess heat, toxic fumes, fire or explosion."" ""Powerbag sources the highest quality cells and parts for the batteries,"" a Ful spokesman wrote in a reply to my worried e-mail. ""Our batteries are all rigorously and thoroughly tested, enduring the most abusive of treatment, still upholding Powerbag's high standard of safety."" When I considered that I keep my phone in my pocket near vital organs, the fear seemed less rational. The battery is stored in a zippered pocket at the bottom of the bag. I wouldn't take the bag on a whitewater canoe trip or a daylong hike under the blistering Egyptian sun, but the rain didn't faze it. My other hangup involved the annoyance of having one more thing to keep charged. I already charge my smartphone, tablet, laptop, iPod, computer mouse and Bluetooth headset. Now I need to charge my shoulder bag, too? However, I was pleasantly surprised by how long the Powerbag's battery lasts. It went for more than a week at a time retaining most of its charge. On a single charge, it can completely fill about two small gadgets -- a phone and iPod, for example. The bag includes three standard-size cords, including one that works with iPhones and iPods, and another that charges BlackBerrys, Mi-Fis and many Android phones. An iPod can be tucked into one zippered pocket while a BlackBerry can go into another, each filling with juice simultaneously. The Powerbag is able to charge an iPad, which is nice because many alarm clocks tailored to iPods and iPhones cannot. But the tablet's big battery sucks power more quickly, and it can't be fit securely anywhere for charging on the go. I was disappointed to learn that the Powerbag doesn't provide an easy way to charge a laptop, which would have been useful for just a few more minutes of work on Wi-Fi at a coffee shop. A standard USB port is hidden in the battery pouch, so perhaps buying a USB-to-laptop charging cord would do the trick. An RFA Brands spokesman said that including a two- or three-prong outlet would require the bag to have a cooling system, which is something the company is not eager to do. There's a conspicuous button on the front of the bag for checking the battery's charge status: up to four small lights, which can be hard to see in daylight. I kept the bag's charger tucked in a pouch inside the bag. The cap and charging port located on the side of the bag snapped off a few days after I started testing it, and so from then on, I had to take the battery out and plug the cord in directly whenever I needed to refuel. The RFA spokesman said this was only an issue with pre-production models, like the one I tested, and that it's been fixed for the bags sold in stores. The Messenger Powerbag costs about $140, same as the backpack, and is sold at some big electronics and office supply stores, including Best Buy and Office Max. RFA also produces bags with bigger batteries for about $40 more. There are several other travel bags on the market that have batteries inside, including ones that can be charged by sunlight using solar panels on the exterior. But most solar-powered bags look like an accessory that would have gotten a kid beat up in school. The Powerbag, designed by Ful, is stylish as well as useful, making it a good companion for gadgetheads who don't want to advertise their geekiness.","We review Powerbag, a line of battery-equipped shoulder bags and backpacks .

"(CNN) -- I once met a mother who named her newborn daughter Kia Sophia. Yes, like the car. Apparently she had one and liked it so much that she wanted to be reminded of it each time she said her baby's name. As we stood there, I could tell this was something she was very proud of, and so I tried my best not to look embarrassed for her. Besides, who was I to judge? I'm named after a useless, deadbeat father. At least the car had resale value. One day, the new mom may regret her decision. One day, her daughter may stop talking to her, opting to let the therapy bills do the talking for her. Or maybe it's the beginning of a new family tradition that lasts generations. Who knows? It's different, but ultimately what we name our children is no one else's business. It certainly isn't something the government should ever be involved with, which of course means it recently became something the government got involved with. In an egregious abuse of power, Lu Ann Ballew, a child support magistrate serving the 4th Judicial District of Tennessee, recently took it upon herself to rename Jaleesa Martin's child because according to Ballew, the name Martin originally chose ""has only been earned by one person, and that one person is Jesus Christ."" Now admittedly if you're going to name your child ""Messiah,"" as Martin did, you should expect some raised brows. Maybe even from the father, though reportedly the case was brought to Ballew because of a dispute over the child's last name, not the first. ""I was shocked,"" Martin said. ""I never intended on naming my son Messiah because it means God, and I didn't think a judge could make me change my baby's name because of her religious beliefs."" She can -- and did -- but shouldn't have. In all likelihood, Ballew's ruling naming the child ""Martin DeShawn McCullough"" will be overturned in an appeal, and the fiasco will go down as a waste of taxpayer dollars. All of which serves as an uneasy reminder that separation of church and state is an ongoing process. And that names matter. While the judge overstepped her boundaries, she is right when she said the name Messiah ""could put him at odds with a lot of people."" A similar impulse might help explain why Heath Campbell, a New Jersey man who named one of his sons Adolf Hitler Campbell, does not have custody of his children. ""Blue Ivy"" is going to be alright because her parents -- Jay Z and Beyonce -- are rich and famous. But for us regular folks, when you name your son something peculiar such as ""Christ"" -- as 29 moms did in 2012 according to the Social Security Administration -- you're opening the kid up for unnecessary ridicule. And maybe even discrimination. I spoke with a handful of HR professionals who told me off the record they would be hesitant to bring in someone with a controversial name such as ""Messiah"" if they were hiring for a conservative company. It is very similar to the impact of having an address based in a poor neighborhood on the resume. And consider this: Researchers combing through U.S. Census Bureau records found that more than 100 years ago, the 20 most popular names were largely the same for blacks and whites, but after the 1970s, that number became much smaller. And a study conducted by the National Bureau of Economic Research did show that the ""whiter"" sounding names on a resume were 50% more likely to get a call back from an employer than a more ethnic sounding one. Another analysis by that group suggests the reason for this isn't directly because of the applicant's race but rather over the past 20 years, certain names have been linked to certain socio-economic status. And we know other minorities such as Asians and Indians have been known to ditch their more ethnic name to blend in and/or avoid having constantly to tell people how to pronounce their name. ""John"" may be a boring, but it is burdenless. Then again, you can't get more ethnic sounding than ""Barack Hussein Obama."" and he has a pretty good job. Maybe there's room for Messiahs and Kia Sophias at the top as well. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson: Parents are entitled to name their children as they choose .

"(CNN) -- Ballot measures approving same-sex marriage and the recreational use of marijuana were approved Tuesday by voters in a handful of states, signaling a historical social shift by popular vote. Voters in Maine approved for the first time in history a measure that gives the right to same-sex couples to marry, while in Maryland voters also made history by upholding a new law allowing same-sex couples to marry in the state, according to CNN projections. A couple of percentage points were all that separated similar measures in Minnesota and Washington, initial returns showed. Colorado and Washington, meanwhile, voted to approve state initiatives legalizing marijuana, while Oregon voters turned away a similar initiative, projections show. Share your reactions to the election outcome . ""The voters have spoken and we have to respect their will. This will be a complicated process, but we intend to follow through,"" Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper said in a statement released late Tuesday. ""That said, federal law still says marijuana is an illegal drug, so don't break out the Cheetos or Goldfish too quickly."" Even as voters returned President Barack Obama to office for a second term, according to CNN projections, a key component of his signature health care reform law was on the line in a number of states. In Alabama and Wyoming, voters approved measures to amend their state constitution to prohibit people from being compelled to participate in Obamacare, while early returns in Montana showed voters approving similar measures. Same-sex marriage wins first-ever ballot box approval . The one exception appears to be Florida, where voters turned back a measure that would have prohibited people and businesses from participating in Obamacare.

Planned Parenthood spent $3.2 million on ads to defeat the measure in Florida during the week heading into the election.

"(CNN) -- Colleges and universities of all types, from for-profits to two-year colleges and Ivy League schools, have been the focus of much debate recently as many students are struggling to meet the ever-growing costs of tuition and student loan debts. But one angle has been subject to less scrutiny: What are colleges and universities providing for the most talented and accomplished students? If something we call higher education isn't the best choice for our highest achieving students, then what is its purpose? In this regard, Peter Thiel, the billionaire co-founder of PayPal and one of the most vocal critics of higher education, believes that college classrooms are doing little to equip our future CEOs, innovators and industry leaders. Thiel has a point. Some of the brightest students might be better off not going to college at all, being forced to take classes in which they have no interest and leaving with burdensome student loan debt. Last year, Thiel took things into his own hands and started the ""20 Under 20 Thiel Fellowship,"" a program that brings together the most enterprising students younger than 20 and offers them a $100,000 grant to skip college and explore their own research and entrepreneurial ideas. Under the tutelage of investors, scientists and like-minded industry tycoons, students are able to develop connections, court investors and promote their businesses on a level that Thiel says colleges cannot provide. In May 2011, Thiel announced the first 24 Thiel Fellows (the applicants were so extraordinary Thiel had to add four more spots). So far, the results have been impressive. Eden Full, 19, who founded Roseicollis Technologies to improve solar energy technology in developing countries, recently won the Staples-Ashoka Youth Social Entrepreneurship award and $260,000 to continue her efforts. Andrew Hsu, 20, started a company called Airy Labs to develop mobile and tablet social learning games for children. Airy Labs reportedly launched with $1.5 million in venture capital funding. Dale Stephens, 20, founded UnCollege, a social movement based on the idea that college isn't the only path to success. Preigee/Penguin Press recently signed Stephens to publish his first book, ""Hacking Your Education,"" a how-to book on developing skills that schools don't teach. Dale Stephens: College is a waste of time . According to James O'Neill, head of the Thiel Foundation, more than 10 of the Fellows have started their own companies, and one of them released his own product on the market. The inaugural class has been so successful that Thiel has already accepted applications for 2012 Fellows, and the winners will be announced next month. Higher education has taken notice, and Thiel's experiment hasn't gone without criticism. Shamus Khan, a sociologist at Columbia University, dubbed Thiel's program ""an act of total self-indulgence."" Critics argue that Thiel's cherry-picked prodigies would thrive no matter what they spent the next fours years doing. For example, Andrew Hsu, mentioned above, dropped out of Stanford University at 19 as a fourth-year neuroscience doctorate candidate. Others say that Thiel's program serves only the interest of the smallest group of the most intellectually advanced students and would in no way aid the overwhelming majority of college-bound students. My view: How to create innovators . And yet, Thiel has already rattled the ivory towers. Facing the prospect of losing their best students to Thiel and other programs like his, universities have scrambled to add their own entrepreneurial programs. Stanford University created StartX, an accelerator for student entrepreneurs. Arizona State University's Venture Catalyst just announced the launch of Furnace, a new startup accelerator to provide funding, facilities and access to top mentors for new student startups. Other venture capitalists have noticed similar shortcomings in higher education and are competing to fill the void. Former Silicon Valley CEO Ben Nelson recently secured $25 million in funding to create an elite global online university targeting the best students around the world. His endeavor has already attracted the likes of Larry Summers, the former president of Harvard University, to his advisory board. It's still too early to tell how Thiel's experiment will turn out. Startups, after all, are always prone to failure. However, he is right about one thing -- higher education deserves more scrutiny and competition. If students like Hsu are so quick to leave the university setting for Thiel's program, then is it truly the best place for the brightest students to be? With bloated tuition costs and questionable academic standards, it's time we challenge the conventional wisdom that college is the only path to advanced education and economic success. Thiel starts at the very top of the higher education system, but the reverberations may be felt throughout. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William J. Bennett.","William Bennett: What does an expensive higher education offer gifted students?

"Washington (CNN) -- If President Barack Obama's relationship with House Speaker John Boehner was contentious in the past, he certainly wasn't showing it while the two sat at the head table of a congressional lunch following Monday's inauguration. The two appeared to have a lighthearted exchange that prompted an apparent eye roll from first lady Michelle Obama, who was seated between them. Was it something Boehner said that prompted the reaction? He tapped her shoulder while she ate her lunch. Or was it something the clearly amused president said? Or maybe it was something both of them said. Maybe it was her lunch. But because there's no audio from the exchange, it's hard to tell what prompted the reaction that caught fire on the Internet.

EW: Jay-Z shoots video at art gallery . That number exceeds the high-profile bows of Daft Punk's Random Access Memories (339,000 its first week out), and Kanye West's Yeezus (327,000). It's still, however, lower to the year's biggest debut, Justin Timberlake's The 20/20 Experience, which notched 968,000. Regardless, Jay himself (plus the RIAA) considers MCHG to be already platinum thanks to the downloads its Samsung app garnered, so there's that too. EW: Jay-Z's 'Magna Carta Holy Grail' - What do you think? And there's yet another front Hov has dominated: Spotify. MCHG snagged the record for the most first-week streams on the platform, with 14 million album streams tallied up in the United States alone. That performance outlaps the previous record-holders, Daft Punk's RAM (9.5 million) and Mumford & Sons' Babel (8 million). MCHG also broke Spotify's record for most single-day streams.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Zsa Zsa Gabor's daughter got her wish when a Los Angeles judge appointed a conservator to oversee the 95-year-old actress's finances and medical care Wednesday. Judge asked to intervene in Zsa Zsa Gabor's care . But the man named temporary conservator is Gabor's ninth husband, Prince Frederic von Anhalt, who has feuded with his stepdaughter Francesca Hilton for years. Hilton contended when she filed for the conservatorship in March that von Anhalt kept her ailing mother ""increasingly isolated"" and ""heavily sedated,"" and she questions his handling of Gabor's finances. Hilton is satisfied, though, because the court order requires her stepfather to provide monthly financial reports and medical records, Hilton lawyer Kenneth Kossoff said. The Hungarian-born actress was once one of Hollywood's most glamorous women, but a broken hip and leg amputation in the past two years have left her confined to a bed. Gabor's only child, the result of her marriage to Conrad Hilton, will also get weekly visits with her mother without von Anhalt present, the judge said. Billionaire's son arrested as wife found dead . The arrangement is an improvement for Hilton because it will ""make sure Zsa Zsa's money is used for Zsa Zsa's benefit and not for anybody's birthday party, billboards or mayoral campaign,"" Kossoff said. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Reva Goetz, who also oversees singer Britney Spears' conservatorship, ordered an end to any powers of attorney von Anhalt might claim that would have allowed him to sell Gabor's Bel Air mansion or other estate assets. As conservator, he must send canceled checks and other financial records to Hilton's lawyer each month. Von Anhalt can make spending decisions with some of the money, but he must get court approval to access one bank account, Kossoff said. Hilton and von Anhalt have battled publicly for several years over Gabor's finances and her access to her mother. ""He's basically taken my mother away from me,"" Hilton told CNN in an interview a year ago. Husband accused of 'slavery and torture' Von Anhalt, in an interview with CNN, said he limits his stepdaughter's access because she brings negativity into the room. ""I want smiling people in here. Happy, smiling people,"" he said. He defended his care of Gabor, saying, ""I'm going to make sure she has a good life, as long as I live, I will take care of her."" Von Anhalt, 68, maintains a high media profile, including a run for governor of California in 2010 that he halted after his wife's hip injury. He is currently an announced candidate for mayor of Los Angeles. He made news several years ago when he claimed to be the father of Anna Nicole Smith's daughter after the actress's death. Paternity tests later disproved that claim. Official: Mother abandons disabled daughter . Last year, von Anhalt announced that he wanted Gabor to become a mother again using an egg donor, artificial insemination and a surrogate mother. ""That's just weird,"" Hilton said at the time. ""I'm a retired guy,"" von Anhalt said then. ""I can take care of it."" The unusual motherhood plan was never hatched. Von Anhalt is 27 years younger than Gabor, whom he married more than 25 years ago. The conservatorship agreement, reached through mediation, expires in January when the judge will revisit the case, the lawyer said.","Francesca Hilton is happy with conservator arrangement for her mom, lawyer says .

"(CNN) -- Last weekend a Texas couple apparently discovered that the electronic ""baby monitor"" in their children's bedroom had been hacked.  According to a local TV station, the couple said they heard an unfamiliar voice coming from the room, went to investigate and found that someone had taken control of the camera monitor remotely and was shouting profanity-laden abuse. The child's father unplugged the monitor. What does this mean for the rest of us? How secure are consumer electronic systems, now that they're all attached to the Internet? The answer is not very, and it's been this bad for many years. Security vulnerabilities have been found in all types of webcams, cameras of all sorts, implanted medical devices, cars, and even smart toilets -- not to mention yachts, ATM machines, industrial control systems and military drones. All of these things have long been hackable. Those of us who work in security are often amazed that most people don't know about it. Why are they hackable? Because security is very hard to get right. It takes expertise, and it takes time. Most companies don't care because most customers buying security systems and smart appliances don't know enough to care. Why should a baby monitor manufacturer spend all sorts of money making sure its security is good when the average customer won't even notice? Five scary hacks . Even worse, that consumer will look at two competing baby monitors -- a more expensive one with better security, and a cheaper one with minimal security -- and buy the cheaper. Without the expertise to make an informed buying decision, cheaper wins. A lot of hacks happen because the users don't configure or install their devices properly, but that's really the fault of the manufacturer. These are supposed to be consumer devices, not specialized equipment for security experts only. This sort of thing is true in other aspects of society, and we have a variety of mechanisms to deal with it. Government regulation is one of them. For example, few of us can differentiate real pharmaceuticals from snake oil, so the FDA regulates what can be sold and what sorts of claims vendors can make. Independent product testing is another. You and I might not be able to tell a well-made car from a poorly-made one at a glance, but we can both read the reports from a variety of testing agencies. 'Smart homes' are vulnerable, say hackers . Computer security has resisted these mechanisms, both because the industry changes so quickly and because this sort of testing is hard and expensive. But the effect is that we're all being sold a lot of insecure consumer products with embedded computers. And as these computers get connected to the Internet, the problems will get worse. The moral here isn't that your baby monitor could be hacked. The moral is that pretty much every ""smart"" everything can be hacked, and because consumers don't care, the market won't fix the problem. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bruce Schneier.","Bruce Schneier: Texas couple's baby monitor hacked. Stranger was looking into child's room .
He says, surprise, many smart electronics attached to internet have long been insecure .

"Ercis, Turkey (CNN) -- In a dramatic rescue that gave hope to those praying for the survival of their loved ones, rescuers in eastern Turkey pulled a baby, her mother and her grandmother alive from the rubble Tuesday, two days after a devastating earthquake. Dramatic video showed tiny Azra Karaduman being carried by rescuers to a vehicle that would take her to the hospital. They were holding a mask over her mouth to help give her oxygen. Later, rescuers pulled the girl's mother and paternal grandmother alive from the rubble as well. Officials said the 2-week-old girl's father remained trapped somewhere under the debris of the multiple-story building. Over several hours, four corpses were pulled from the rubble of the same building, officials said. At least one of them was male. Officials did not say immediately whether one of the bodies was the baby's father. The official death toll jumped to 459 Tuesday, with another 1,352 people injured, the Turkish Disaster and Emergency Relief Agency said. Teams of rescuers throughout the poor region struck by Sunday's 7.2-magnitude quake are searching for survivors around the clock. Reaching Azra -- who, according to her maternal grandmother, was born three weeks prematurely -- was particularly difficult, rescuers told CNN. The baby's mother managed to make contact with rescuers and get the baby to them through a narrow passage, a rescuer said. Officials had to find a rescuer thin enough to fit into the crevice to get Azra. The rescuer told CNN it was the first time he had ever pulled someone alive from earthquake rubble in 12 years of doing such work. While rescuers worked to get to the mother and grandmother, they managed to supply the two women with oxygen, officials said. ""It was hard to rescue them"" because of the tight space, said rescue worker Tansu Bayram. ""It was so difficult."" Some 2,262 buildings in the region lie in ruins. The military is assisting rescue workers, who are using heavy machinery, shovels, and their bare hands. Numerous aftershocks -- the largest a magnitude 6.0 -- have rattled the area, which is one of the poorest in Turkey. One on Tuesday measured 5.7, and was 7 km (4.3 miles) deep. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said 55 buildings collapsed in Ercis on the north shore of Lake Van. The Turkish Red Crescent said about 25 apartment buildings and a student dormitory also collapsed in the town. A health services building also collapsed, along with part of a hospital, CNN sister network CNN Turk reported. The injured were being treated in the hospital's garden. ""People are really scared,"" CNN Turk reporter Nevsin Mengu said from Van on Monday. ""The survivors are now trying to survive the cold weather."" Rescuers and survivors contended with near-freezing temperatures. Some people collected wood from collapsed buildings to burn for warmth, Mengu said. She said many residents are not returning to their houses, opting instead to sleep on rooftops or in the streets. It was not clear whether their homes were uninhabitable or if they were just too frightened. Are you there? Submit your pictures or video . The Red Crescent called for rescue workers, machinery and drinking water. A crisis center was set up by the country's Health Ministry in the Turkish capital of Ankara. By Monday, more than 2,300 emergency personnel were in the region, Deputy Prime Minister Besir Atalay said. Tents and rescue teams have come from as far away as Iran and Azerbaijan. Israel's Ministry of Defense said that on Wednesday, a plane with several portable housing structures will fly to eastern Turkey, the first of a number of flights accommodating a Turkish request for assistance. It will be a civilian plane rented by the Israeli government, the ministry said. ""The United Nations is in contact with the relevant authorities and stands ready to offer any assistance if requested,"" Martin Nesirky, spokesman for U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, said Monday. Turkey is ""no stranger to having these seismic events,"" but Sunday's quake is considered major, CNN Meteorologist Reynolds Wolf said. A magnitude-7.6 earthquake in Izmit, Turkey, killed more than 17,000 people in 1999, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. A magnitude-7.2 tremor in Duzce the same year killed 894 people, the agency reported. Sunday's quake struck at 1:41 p.m. local time and was centered about 12 miles from Van, the agency said. CNN's Talia Kayali and Hande Atay contributed to this report.","NEW: The death toll jumps to 459 .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Genarlow Wilson, freed last week from a Georgia prison, said he's glad he rejected a plea deal from prosecutors, even if it would have sprung him from prison months earlier. Genarlow Wilson tells CNN on Sunday that he will be more conservative and alert in the future. The 21-year-old, who served two years of a 10-year sentence for aggravated child molestation, said the prospect of being labeled a sex offender drove him to turn down the deal. He had to think about his 9-year-old sister and having a family of his own one day, he said Sunday. ""It might've been lesser time, but then again, I would have nowhere to go because I would have no home,"" Wilson said during a CNN interview scheduled to air Monday at 8 p.m. ""I wouldn't be able to stay with my mother because I have a little sister. You know, when you're a sex offender you can't be around kids. Basically, I can't even have kids myself, you know, so what is the point of life?"" he asked. In 2005, a jury found Wilson guilty of aggravated child molestation for having oral sex with a 15-year-old girl at a 2003 New Year's Eve party. Wilson was 17 at the time of the party.  Watch Wilson say why he rejected the plea deal » . The conviction carried a 10-year mandatory prison sentence and a sex offender designation. According to Georgia Attorney General Thurbert Baker, prosecutors in Douglas County, Georgia, offered Wilson a plea deal that would have reduced his sentence, possibly to time served, and would have eventually removed the conviction and sex offender status from his record. Defense attorney B.J. Bernstein said in June that Wilson rejected the deal because he didn't want to plead guilty to a felony with a 15-year sentence. The state Legislature last year amended the law under which Wilson was convicted, making such sexual encounters misdemeanors. However, the Legislature did not make the law retroactive, so it had no effect on Wilson's sentence. Now 21, Wilson was released Friday after the state Supreme Court ruled 4-3 that the young man's sentence ""constitutes cruel and unusual punishment."" Wilson said Sunday he feels no ""negative energy"" toward District Attorney David McDade, who fought efforts to have Wilson's sentence reduced. Instead, Wilson said, he is focused on the future and hopes to soon immerse himself in his college studies. He wants to major in sociology, he said, ""because I feel like I've been living my major."" The new Genarlow Wilson will be more conservative, more alert and more appreciative of the blessings bestowed upon him, he said. ""When it seems like you have everything, you know, you feel like you have no worries until it's all gone, and I know what it feels like to be without and I don't want to ever feel like that again,"" said the former honor student, football star and homecoming king. ""I don't ever want to see the inside of a prison or a prison, period."" Though he called his sentence ""absurd,"" Wilson said he understands that prosecutors ""were doing their job and they felt they were carrying out the law."" Wilson also said he knows what he did was foolish. ""I was young then. I did some idiotic things in my teen years, but you know, every average teen does,"" he said. ""I don't think any of us made very wise decisions, but I don't think that any of us can go back then and change what happened.""

"(CNN) -- Rui Costa rode to his second stage win of this year's Tour de France Friday as Chris Froome moved ever closer to overall victory in the centenary edition of cycling's most famous race. Portugal's Costa backed up his triumph in Tuesday's 16th stage into Gap with a similar victory. The Movistar rider burst out of a chasing group to catch long time leader Pierre Rolland of France (Europcar) on the final big climb of the Col de la Croix Fry and finished clear in Le Grand-Bornand. German veteran Andreas Kloden (RadioShack) was 47 seconds adrift. It was also a familiar situation among the leading contenders, with Britain's Froome protecting his five minutes 11 second advantage over Alberto Contador of Spain. Contador's Saxo-Tinkoff team again launched numerous attacks, but Froome, who had shown signs of weakness on the previous day's finish up L'Alpe d'Huez, easily countered the moves. Froome, all set to succeed fellow Briton and Sky teammate Bradley Wiggins as Tour de France winner, was again grateful for the support of his loyal lieutenant, Richie Porte of Australia, in a dramatically whittled down main bunch. ""I felt pretty tired after yesterday to be honest but I'm really relieved to have today behind us,"" he told the official Tour de France website. ""This is an incredible position for me to be in. I mean, to be here one day away from Paris with a five minute advantage on the second place on GC is really a good position to be in but, having said that, I don't want to be too complacent at all."" Saturday will see the Kenyan-born Froome tackle his final challenge in the Alps over 125 km from Annecy to the summit of Annecy-Semnoz. Contador is likely to come under pressure from Colombian Nairo Quintana (Movistar), who is third overall at five minutes 32 seconds adrift, but has been showing fine late form in the mountains. Meanwhile the specter of drugs cast a shadow on proceedings as former Giro d'Italia winner Damiano Cunego was among 28 people connected to the Lampre team to be charged with doping-related offences, by prosecutors in Padua. Cunego, who is riding this year's Tour de France, but languishes in 56th position, one hour 42 minutes behind Froome, is the biggest name caught up in the potential scandal. Former world champion Alessandro Ballan is also implicated with a clutch of officials and team doctors. They are accused of a large scale doping operation, involving the blood-boosting EPO, anabolic steroids, human growth hormone and testosterone. Lampre mounted a stout defense of its riders and team on its official website, saying they would be able to mount a strong defense when the case is heard in December. In a statement, the team expressed its ""full confidence in team members involved in this affair.""","Rui Costa wins 19th stage of Tour de France .

"New York (CNN) -- City Council Speaker Christine Quinn -- one of the candidates leading New York City's hotly contested mayoral race -- won a major victory over outgoing Mayor Michael Bloomberg with the council's override on a mayoral veto of a Quinn bill establishing an inspector general for the NYPD. This decision Thursday comes near the end of a summer in which allegations of racial profiling and racial tensions have been an undercurrent in cases and controversies across the county including in New York, where stop-and-frisk policies by police triggered intense political debate and a court case. NYPD tactics and policies have pitted some big names against each other, mainly Bloomberg vs. Quinn, and have been a leading issue in the mayoral primary coming up on September 10. Originally introduced by the New York City Council in June, the bill that Quinn co-authored adds an inspector general who will have the power to investigate, review, and make recommendations regarding NYPD operations, policies and programs. A complaint bureau will also be added that allows the public to report any issues or deficiencies relating to the NYPD. Bloomberg vetoed that bill and another one dealing with racial profiling in July, claiming that current police practices -- including stop-and-frisk -- have contributed to a decreased crime rate in recent years. In a statement released after Thursday's vote overriding his veto, Bloomberg declared that the two measures will make it harder for police officers to do their job and could actually make crime worse in minority neighborhoods, where crime rates are already high. After the veto override, Quinn said, ""Today's vote is an historic step in the right direction to bring much needed reform to the city's stop-and-frisk program and begin building greater bridges between our police department and communities of color."" City Council members also knocked down Bloomberg's veto of the other bill, which would prohibit biased-based profiling, and provide a pathway for those who feel they have been wronged to seek legal redress. Quinn voted against the passage of that measure Thursday, reportedly because of concerns over one provision in the bill. The NYPD's stop-and-frisk policy was targeting in a federal class-action lawsuit, and earlier this month U.S. District Judge Shira A. Scheindlin ruled that changes must be made to the policy because it unlawfully targets blacks and Hispanics. Scheindlin found that the police department's policy violated plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment rights barring unreasonable searches, based on statistics showing police made at least 200,000 stops from 2004 to June 2012 without reasonable suspicion. She also found evidence of racial profiling, violating plaintiffs' 14th Amendment rights guaranteeing equal protection. New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly called Scheindlin's finding of racial profiling ""disturbing and offensive."" ""We do not engage in racial profiling. It is prohibited by law,"" Kelly said earlier this month. ""We train our officers that they need reasonable suspicion to make a stop, and I can assure you that race is never a reason to conduct a stop."" In his statement Thursday after his vetoes were trumped, Bloomberg said, ""Our Administration has zero tolerance for racial profiling. (The anti-profiling measure in the council) is not aimed at stopping racial profiling, which is already against the law. It's aimed at winning votes. It is a dangerous piece of legislation and we will ask the courts to step in before innocent people are harmed."" The changes in the two measures are set to take effect on January 1. CNN's Chris Kokenes, Chelsea J. Carter, and Jason Hanna contributed to this report.","Christine Quinn is speaker of the NYC City Council, also a mayoral candidate .

"(CNN) -- Martina Hingis is back -- but the five-time grand slam winner says she has no plans to take on the world's best any time soon. The 32-year-old ended her six-year absence from competitive WTA action by playing doubles alongside Slovakia's Daniela Hantuchova at the Southern California Open Wednesday. Hingis, who retired for the second time in 2007, spent 209 weeks as the world's top-ranked player after bursting onto the scene as a teenager. The Swiss ace has already confirmed that she will play alongside Hantuchova at the U.S. Open and enjoyed a winning start following a 6-1 6-1 victory over Germany's Julia Goerges and Croatian Darija Jurak. But Hingis ruled out any thoughts of a comeback on the singles tour -- insisting that it's doubles or nothing. ""Not singles, no,"" she told reporters after being asked if she wanted to return to the women's circuit. ""It's a completely different world. Even World Team Tennis (WTT) now, it's brutal, it's only one set but still the next day you wake up, and you have to put so much more effort into it."" Hingis has spent the past few months playing World Team Tennis on a regular basis and helped the Washington Kastles win the WTT league title in July. But her return to WTA action has given her a new lease of life and an extra buzz. ""It was awesome,"" Hingis told the WTA official website. ""It took Daniela a lot of courage and inspiration to kind of dig me out of the grave, but I'm really happy to have a partner like her, it makes it so much easier. I was nervous going into the match, but she was really solid out there, and that gave me so much more confidence. ""After the first set it was pure pleasure."" Hingis first emerged as a star in the making at the age of 15 when she partnered Helena Sukova to win a grand slam doubles crown. The following year she became the youngest ever singles winner at the age of 16 years and three months at the Australian Open before becoming the youngest woman to become the World No.1. Hingis, who also won nine grand slam doubles titles, was forced to retire at the age of 22 in 2003 following a struggle with injury problems. She returned to action in 2005 but her comeback was cut short in 2007 when it was divulged that she had tested positive for a metabolite of cocaine after her third round loss at Wimbledon six years ago. Hingis maintained her innocence, but was banned for two years by the International Tennis Federation. Fast forward to the present day and Hingis is more philosophical about her tennis having spent years in the wilderness. ""When you're 17 everything seems so easy, but now I'm almost twice the age,"" she added. ""I wouldn't want to come out and play one or two matches and then lose third round, that's not my type of personality. ""I feel pretty good. We'll see how it goes this summer. ""Obviously I wouldn't put myself in this position if I didn't feel like I could compete at this level.""","Martina Hingis has returned to competitive action for the first time since 2007 .

"(CNN) -- ""I was owned by Johnson Bell and born in New Orleans, in Louisiana."" Those words were spoken by a man named Frank Bell. He said that according ""to the bill of sale, I'm 86 years old."" His words, and those of thousands of other American citizens, were transcribed in the 1930s, at the depth of the Great Depression. As part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's efforts to restart the economy, the Works Progress Administration was founded, and one arm of the WPA was something called the Federal Writers' Project. Men and women were hired by the government to work on various assignments documenting American history and American life. One of those assignments, vast in scope, came to be known as the Slave Narratives. ""If a woman was a good breeder she brought a good price on the auction block,"" said Hattie Rogers, a North Carolina resident, when she was interviewed in 1937. ""The slave buyers would come around and jab them in the stomach and look them over and if they thought they would have children fast they brought a good price."" We are in the midst of Black History Month. The slave years in the United States were not only black history, they were American history -- the ugliest and most indefensible chapter. I had long heard of the Slave Narratives, but had never read them. The original interviews comprised 17 bound volumes in the Library of Congress, filled with the firsthand accounts of more than 2,000 former slaves, and hundreds of photographs. The interviewers were sent to 17 states, and that is how the printed conversations are bound and arranged. I have been reading two volumes -- covering interviews done in North Carolina and in Texas. What is so shattering is the matter-of-fact tone of what the former slaves said. The United States was well into the 20th century by the time the interviews were conducted; automobiles had come to the nation, as had radio and motion pictures and air travel. The country, in many ways, was beginning to resemble the nation we live in now. Yet residing in America's cities and towns were men and women who recalled being sold at auction, of seeing brothers and sisters led away in chains, of having -- in their words -- ""good owners"" or ""cruel masters."" Survivors of a time when, in many states, it was perfectly lawful for human beings to own other human beings, and to buy and sell them. Mary Armstrong, 91 and living in Houston when she was interviewed, said the person who owned her family was ""so mean he never would sell the man and woman and (children) to the same one. He'd sell the man here and the woman there and if (there were children) he'd sell them someplace else."" Charity Riddick, 80, interviewed in North Carolina, had a similar memory. ""I belonged to Madison Pace in slavery time,"" she said. She had a brother whose first name was Washington, she said, but he was ""sold away."" Their mother ""cried a lot about it."" The former slaves who were still alive in the 1930s were, of course, the youngest of those who were enslaved before emancipation. Many of them were relating childhood or adolescent memories, while others were passing on what their parents related to them. There were many, however, who were old enough to have vivid firsthand recollections of specific instances. Stearlin Arnwine, who was 94 and living near Jacksonville, Texas, when he was interviewed, said he would see slaves on the auction block, stripped to the waist for inspection by potential buyers. Women and their children, he said, would be crying and begging ""not to be separated,"" but it did no good: ""They had to go."" As anguishing as are the stories recounted by the former slaves, troubling in a different way was the methodology many of the interviewers chose in committing the stories to written form. Most of the writers were white; in the 1930s, apparently it was still considered acceptable to use crudely rendered dialect in recreating on paper the speech patterns of African-Americans. That is how some of the writers transcribed the interviews, and in many cases it comes off as something close to mockery, whether or not it was intended that way. The power of the stories overrides everything else. The quiet starkness of the telling: . ""My father was a slave, A.H. Stewart, belonging to James Arch Stewart, a slave owner, whose plantation was in Wake County,"" said Sam T. Stewart, 84, interviewed in North Carolina in June 1937. ""When I was two years old James Arch Stewart sold my father to speculators, and he was shipped to Mississippi. I was too young to know my father."" You can read from the volumes for hours at a time, and when you are finished for the evening you can look around you and try to comprehend that all of this was taking place in the same nation where we live today. Alex Woods, of Raleigh, North Carolina, born on May 15, 1858, said that as a boy he saw slaves being marched on their way to the auction block, each person chained to the one next to him, and, as he witnessed this, being ""afraid my mother and father would be sold away from me."" Story after story after story. Henry H. Buttler, 87, living in Fort Worth in the 1930s but born a slave in Virginia: . ""The plantation consisted of about 30 acres, with about 30 slaves, though this number varied and sometimes reached 50. Mr. Sullivan owned my mother and her children, but my father was owned by Mr. John Rector, whose place was adjacent to ours."" And, when Abraham Lincoln proclaimed that this must no longer be permitted to go on, millions of Americans said that he was dead wrong.

"(CNN) -- Like most Americans, I am stupefied that the Transportation Security Administration will soon permit passengers to carry some small knives on airplanes, especially since the process that turns checkpoints into maddening logjams -- removing shoes, liquids and computers -- remains unchanged. The only thing more surprising is the news that they will also allow items such as pool cues, lacrosse sticks and one or two golf clubs. Who travels with one golf club? I can just see ""Happy Gilmore"" twirling his nine-iron as he makes his way through airplane terminals around the country. The absurdity is just laughable - only this is serious. Former TSA chief backs 'knife' decision, suggests axes . There is a reason knives were banned in the first place -- they killed people and made the 9/11 attacks possible. The TSA argues that hijacking procedures have changed and cockpits aren't likely to be breached by knife-wielding terrorists again. ""Sharp objects can no longer bring down aircraft,"" former TSA chief Kip Hawley told CNN. Note the word ""aircraft"" -- not people. As someone who was a flight attendant for United Airlines on 9/11, I am intimately familiar with that logic. Only a few weeks after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, I sat through cockpit briefings that went something like this: ""If a terrorist takes you hostage, we will have to let you die,"" or ""If terrorists take over the cabin, we will drive the plane into the ground."" In other words, knives probably won't endanger pilots, skyscrapers or expensive airplanes, but passengers and flight attendants? You're on your own. I don't know about you, but I find that blatantly offensive. When terrorists use box cutters and pocketknives to slit your colleagues' throats, you don't move on so easily. And that is why I am so utterly slack-jawed at the decision to allow the same weapons that were used to kill so many people. In 2004, the 9/11 Commission found that terrorists used knives such as Leatherman tools to overtake the crew. Air marshals, flight attendants want TSA to reconsider . Even if I were to concede that small knives no longer pose as imminent a threat as say, bottled water or shampoo, allowing knives stirs up grief and fear for so many. And what is the upside? The TSA claims this policy will benefit passengers, citing the 850 pounds of banned goods that are surrendered at checkpoints each month. Who are these people who don't know about the 12-year-long ban on knives? The same ones who can't buckle a seat belt without watching a safety demo, I suppose. So the TSA, an already embattled agency, is annoying most of the country and pissing off hoards of flight attendants for the sole benefit of their own screeners and the apparently powerful knife-nut lobby. Could it unwittingly help terrorists, too? If the search for knives truly is the culprit that's clogging up screening lanes, maybe those who bring them should be fined. There is no question that our security system is a catastrophe and desperately needs to be overhauled. Do you ever notice just how drastically people's moods change after navigating a checkpoint at a major airport? It's shocking to watch travelers enter the line all smiley and jazzed about a vacation or career opportunity only to emerge exhausted, disheveled, angry and possibly late. I would even argue that, ironically, the current security system contributes to air rage, an increasing threat of its own. However, I don't believe for one minute that being forced to check one's sporting equipment is anywhere near the heart of the problem. We need faster and easier checkpoints, but instead of coming up with a novel approach, the TSA wants to go backward. Allowing such weapons just doesn't make sense. Unless, of course, you believe the only thing that will stop a bad guy with a billiards cue is a good guy with a Wiffle ball bat. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tiffany Hawk.","Tiffany Hawk shocked TSA soon will allow air passengers to carry some small knives .

"(CNN) -- Sandwiched between Hong Kong and Shenzhen -- two of the world's busiest metropolises -- lies a Cold War-era anomaly: a 26 square kilometer green zone that is home to isolated villages, fishponds and flocks of migratory birds. Little more than 50m to the north, beyond the mesh fence and barbed wire that mark the border between mainland China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the skyscrapers of Shenzhen loom incongruously over the wetlands and vegetable patches of the Frontier Closed Area. Established in 1951 after the Korean War placed colonial Hong Kong in the frontline of a U.N. embargo against the People's Republic of China, the buffer zone was created to stop illegal immigrants, smugglers and spies. Sixty years later and the Frontier Closed Area has long since passed its useful life, leaving behind a natural habitat largely untouched by humans and some of the most valuable undeveloped real estate in the world. Last month, the Hong Kong government launched the first stage of a large-scale reduction in the area of the zone, allowing public access to 740 hectares of the 2,800 hectare cordon. Previously, tourists and non-residents needed permits to enter the zone and the estimated 9,500 people living inside the area were required to flash special passes to take transport into the frontier area. While the move represents a further step in the integration of Hong Kong -- until 1997 a British colony -- with mainland China, at a local level a spat is brewing over the future use of the valuable stretch of land. Villagers from Lin Ma Hang, a hamlet of little more than 150 people which will remain within the closed area until 2015, claim the government's plan to turn the area into a ""green buffer"" will interfere with their right to develop property they have owned for generations. While the rest of Hong Kong is riding a boom, property prices in the Frontier Closed Area have been depressed for decades. As the temperature of the debate ramps up, Lin Ma Hang residents have told Hong Kong government meetings they will fight land use plans for the Frontier Closed Area in the same way they fought and resisted the Japanese during the war. Lin Ma Hang village chief Yip Wah-ching told local media the residents of the zone are not against plans for a green heritage zone, but he believed there should be plenty of room for tourism-related projects. ""After our section of the FCA is fully opened to the public, we hope the government will step forward and give us the necessary support for tourism and agricultural development,"" he told China Daily. Under a feasibility study undertaken by the Hong Kong Planning Department, with the help of global engineering giants ARUP, the government envisages a public-private partnership to create a combined conservation and eco-tourism zone involving low-density private residential and passive recreation development. While the study does not envisage large-scale development in the zone, it does not rule it out in the future depending on Hong Kong's population and economic pressures. Already conservationists have expressed concern over the fate of wetlands in the zone which make up part of the East Asian-Australasian flyway -- a corridor for migratory birds. As many as 10 species of globally endangered birds use this wetlands, according to conservation group Birdlife International. While half the wetlands fall within the protected area of the Mai Po and Inner Deep Bay nature reserve, the other half is in part of the Frontier Closed Area that could be earmarked for development. Ecologists fear that if the integrity of the continuous habitat is interrupted, the whole system could be under threat. Conservation manager at the World Wildlife Fund, Alan Leung, says the pressure from land-hungry Hong Kong -- which has some of the highest land and property prices in the world -- means any conservation programs for the area would need to be strongly policed. In the past, Hong Kong developers have used illegal tactics such as tree-felling, landfill and land excavation to degrade land, later lodging development applications that claim the area had little or no conservation value. ""Our biggest concern is unauthorized development,"" Leung told CNN. ""Much of this area is out of sight of the general public. It's very difficult for the government to monitor it.""","Hong Kong's border with China includes a 26sq km land zone, the Frontier Closed Area .

"New York (CNN) -- Mayor Michael Bloomberg, known in New York City for his tough regulations on everything from large sodas to smoking in Central Park, proposed a new target during his final State of the City speech Thursday: plastic foam containers. ""Styrofoam increases the cost of recycling by as much as $20 per ton because it has to be removed,"" the mayor said. ""Something we know is environmentally destructive, that is costing taxpayers money, and that is easily replaceable, I think, is something we can do without."" Specifically, the ban will target certain polystyrene foam products, not necessarily Styrofoam, a trademarked product of Dow Chemical Co. used in foam insulation and construction products. ""With Speaker (Christine) Quinn and the City Council, we'll work to adopt a law banning Styrofoam food packaging from our stores and restaurants,"" Bloomberg added. ""And don't worry, the doggy bag and the coffee cup will survive just fine."" It was not immediately clear how the majority of businesses that use polystyrene foam products would react to a ban. One early response from the Dunkin' Donuts chain was not positive. Instead of an outright ban, it said in a written statement, the company has ""reviewed or tested nearly every type of single-use hot cup on the market, but a viable alternative does not yet exist. This is a process, and we will continue to test and try new things until we find a cup that keeps drinks hot, hands cool and is better for the planet. ""A polystyrene ban will not eliminate waste or increase recycling; it will simply replace one type of trash with another,"" it said. Until a solution is found, Dunkin' Donuts has cut the weight of its foam and plastic cups and ""offered our franchisees a reusable mug program."" Plastic foam product limitations have already been ordered in several other cities, including Seattle, Washington, and Brookline, Massachusetts. Throughout his tenure, Bloomberg has garnered a reputation for bold and sometimes controversial initiatives. Despite public outcry, he pushed to regulate trans fat in food preparation in 2007, signed into law a ban on smoking in most public spaces in 2011, and last March prohibited sugary drinks in containers larger than 16 ounces in certain venues. The mayor has also advocated for, and sometimes financially supported, same-sex marriage, gun control, and several new public health proposals. ""Now we are working on obesity and hopefully the courts won't stop us,"" Bloomberg said of his health policy efforts during a January press conference. ""These small public health things that we do really make a difference in people's lives.""","Mayor Michael Bloomberg wants to ban the use of plastic foam containers .

"(CNN) -- Over the past two years the United Kingdom's press freedom ranking has declined. In the 2011/2012 Reporters Sans Frontieres (RSF) index, the UK ranked 28th out of 179 countries, and in the 2013 index the country went down a point ranking at 29 out of 179 countries. The UK prides itself on being a country with a long heritage of upholding the rights of individuals accompanied by a free and strong press. The UK government is a P5 member of the U.N. Security Council, a leading country in the G8, European Union, and the Commonwealth, and uses its influence to advocate for human rights to be respected globally. Two years ago, the News of the World phone hacking scandal shook the institutional confidence of the UK media to its core. The UK's innate belief of the right to a free and strong press betrayed the innate respect of the same national belief -- the rights of individuals. The conclusions found in the Lord Judge Leveson inquiry cemented this scandal as not only unprecedented but raised the question, for the first time ever, if legislation was needed to regulate the UK press? Greenwald: Lawsuit filed in UK over Miranda's detention . Much debate led to the draft Royal Charter for UK Press Self-Regulation. The draft document outlines how the UK should devise a self-regulatory body within its longstanding history of media freedom. The UK is now faced with yet another situation that has shocked the international community and shaken the country's press freedom identity for a second time -- the detention of David Miranda (assisting his partner, Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald). The Greenwald/ Miranda case, however, flies in the face of the argument of UK press self-regulation and raises great concern over terrorism laws, investigative journalism and the protection of journalists' sources. The question remains, however, does the UK's press freedom ranking reflect the debate now ensuing the country on UK press regulation and now the protection of journalists sources, or is there more to the methodology of the UK ranking than meets the eye? In other words, can the UK improve its ranking? The research is based on a two tiered system: In-house research and a questionnaire sent to press freedom experts and journalists. RSF's research for the UK's 2013 ranking focused on areas of concern such as, the [then] libel laws (which had been reformed after the publication of the 2013 index), the draft Communications Data Bill, which had been rejected but is now under reconsideration and, lastly, elements of the UK anti-terror laws. UK based NGO Article 19 published a report which outlines the three problematic ""themes"" found in UK anti-terror laws: ""The broad definition of terrorism, the use of anti-terror laws to stifle legitimate social and political protest and the new prohibitions on the encouragement, other inducement or glorification of terrorism."" RSF has found that a significant factor in index ranking methodology is that index rankings should not be taken as an indication of the quality of the media in the countries concerned. Such a concept brings the discussion to the heart of the matter within the UK. How can the UK, with the established fundamental freedoms of a democratic society, government, parliament, judiciary and media not rank in the top echelon of press freedom indexes? When examining countries that score within the top echelon in the RSF and Freedom House press freedom indexes, a number of the countries do have press self-regulatory bodies underpinned by statute. Miranda 'afraid' during questioning . Media regulation within historically and fundamentally democratic nations does not necessarily equate to a lack of press freedom in countries which rank in the top echelon on press freedom indexes and have self-regulatory bodies underpinned by statutes. Self-regulatory press systems, however, might not be applied as successfully in countries that do not have deeply rooted democratic traditions and systems in place, and do not meet all international standards of human rights. The issue is wider and more complex than the notion of one glove fits all. Is such a system right for the UK with a deeply rooted tradition of good governance and democratic values compared to other like-minded western countries that have press self-regulatory bodies, underpinned by statute, and rank higher than the UK in press freedom indexes? Professor Robert Picard, director of research at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at Oxford University states: ""Indexes are not a perfect science; many smaller Western countries are more open and transparent [Iceland and Sweden, for example] as opposed to larger Western countries, particularly those larger Western countries that lead in international intervention. Western countries that lead in international intervention will not be as transparent with official documents and operations, as Western countries which do not lead on international intervention, due to security reasons and because of confidential relationships with foreign governments. For example, in Iceland, almost all official and political documents can be viewed by the public on or off line -- even the Iceland president's telephone number can be found in the phone book."" Professor Picard concluded: ""With this in mind, countries like the UK will most likely never be number one in press freedom rankings, unless the county's entire political, economic and international stance changes drastically, making the UK a country that does not lead on international intervention."" Some research has found that a country having a press self-regulatory body underpinned by statute does not always mean that the quality of the media within the country suffers, if the country has strong standing democratic traditions of good governance, independent judiciary, and upholds international standards for all human rights. In the wake of the Greenwald/ Miranda case, the UK must examine that the legal frameworks in place to protect its citizens from terrorism, has intelligent checks and balances that allow for the free flow of investigative journalism and information that is published for the same national interest. Upon publication of the Leveson report, RSF pointed out, however, that non-regulation, especially for a country that sets the precedent with longstanding respect and tradition of press freedom, is always the most advantageous, and in some circumstances, the best choice. As pointed out in Lara Fielden's report, ""Regulating for Trust in Journalism,"" James Harding, editor of The Times observed: ""The phone-hacking scandal has put investigative journalism in the dock, and it was [UK] investigative journalism that put it there."" In regards to the Greenwald/Miranda case -- if you silence the media, you silence informed citizenry; without informed citizens freedom of information, freedom of any kind, can be greatly compromised.

"(CNN) -- When the doors opened onto WABC's New York studios after the televised Democratic mayoral debate Tuesday night, reporters rushed in to surround two people. The first was Public Advocate Bill de Blasio -- in first place, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released earlier in the day. But the larger crowd was surrounding Anthony Weiner, the former congressman who is polling in fourth place and who spent much of the night being ignored by his rivals. Weiner may have turned his once-promising campaign into a disaster with the recent fresh crop of sexting revelations, but he has not ceased being the star of the campaign, much to his rivals' chagrin. Weiner is now reaching for a silver lining from the scandal that has cost him dearly in the polls and sealed off whatever long-shot chances he had at victory. He's taking all the unflattering, pun-filled stories about him and saying ""that's what it's like to be mayor."" He's turning his unflattering press into evidence of his mettle. So, the more fights with the media, the more chances he has to say he's independent, he's fighting, he's ready for City Hall. Last week, he mocked a British reporter's accent during an impromptu interview outside a public housing building where he was campaigning. Their exchange ended with him giving an unsolicited weather report to viewers in Britain. (""It's gonna be raining, cloudy and gray. So do what you can, guys,"" he said.) While being mayor of New York is indeed akin to being in the eye of a media storm, what's happening to candidate Weiner is different. Opinion: Hey Weiner, New York doesn't like to look stupid . He omitted a key detail in the redemption story that he brought to the race: Weiner continued sexting after resigning from Congress and tearfully telling the public how much pain it had caused his wife and those close to him. That is what is at the heart of the criticism. It's not the newness of the details but rather the newness of the facts. But for a candidate who is less than a month away from the primary, there is little to do but continue. He has a reputation to salvage, issues to push and campaign money to spend. So, given the circumstances, the bad-news-is-proof-I'm-ready argument may be Weiner's only argument. And so, in a live interview with BuzzFeed Editor Ben Smith on Monday, Weiner fielded questions about his sexting scandal and the role his wife may play in an expected Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, and he accused the New York Times of ""never"" liking him, because of his independence. (In 2008, after an unflattering story about his frequent staff changes, Weiner told me the Times had become ""tabloidy."") Hours before Tuesday's debate, Weiner's campaign released a video showing the candidate happily announcing that he doesn't care what the New York Post or Daily News say about him, because he's so independent from them. When Weiner launched his campaign in late April, it was viewed largely as an effort to rehabilitate his image after his 2011 scandal and resignation from Congress. Nobody wants the last words on this career to be ""sex scandal,"" ""resignation"" or ""disgrace."" But Weiner has lost ground since his scandal resurfaced; just last month, polls had him leading the Democratic field. Opinion: Will 'sexters' give Weiner a pass? On Tuesday night, Weiner tried painting the rivals on stage with him as all coming from the same political establishment that has long governed New York. About halfway through the debate, Weiner said, ""My fellow New Yorkers, this is the problem,"" referring to his rivals, who had just been arguing with one another on stage. ""You know they all come from basically the same place; they've been part of municipal government for decades now. They've all been part of it: a comptroller, a former comptroller, a public advocate, a speaker. They're from the same place."" He told viewers that if they wanted someone to ""stop this noise,"" he was their candidate. ""Not for nothing,"" countered City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, ""you were in government your whole career until you had to resign from government, so I'm not sure why you're finger-pointing at people in government."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Azi Paybarah.","Azi Paybarah: Weiner falling in polls but still draws most attention; trying to leverage that .

"Jinan, China (CNN) -- Facing his former deputy whose attempted defection to the United States sealed both men's fate, fallen high-flying politician Bo Xilai continued his defiant stance Saturday as his increasingly dramatic trial stretched into a third day. The former Communist Party chief of the sprawling south-western metropolis of Chongqing denied abusing his power -- the third and final charge heard in court stemming from his actions after Wang Lijun, then the city's police chief, told Bo that local police were investigating his wife Gu Kailai for murder. Prosecutors accuse Bo of threatening and improperly firing Wang upon learning of the murder investigation, causing Wang to seek asylum in the U.S. consulate in a nearby city in early February 2012, and triggering the greatest political crisis for the Communist Party in decades. ""I have made mistakes. I feel regret and I'm willing to take responsibility,"" Bo, 64, was quoted as saying in a transcript released by the Jinan Intermediate People's court in eastern China, where he is also being tried for bribe-taking and embezzlement. ""But whether or not I've committed a crime is a different issue."" ""I didn't bend the law to protect Gu Kailai,"" he said. ""I didn't force Wang Lijun out or force him to defect to the United States."" Bo did acknowledge slapping Wang in the face -- a key moment long considered a turning point in the two men's relationship -- during a confrontation, claiming he was furious at his ""double-faced"" deputy who had faked his loyalty to the Bo family. Taking the witness stand, Wang described an even more disturbing sequence of events in Bo's office a day after he told his boss about the murder investigation in late January 2012. ""He started verbally assaulting me... and about three minutes later, he walked around the left side of his desk and stood in front me. He suddenly attacked me with his fist, hitting on my left ear -- it was not just a slap,"" Wang recalled, according to a court transcript. ""My body shook a little... and I found blood at the corner of my mouth and discharge in my ear,"" he continued. ""I wiped the blood off with a tissue, but when he heard me calmly tell him again that he had to face the reality, he threw a glass on the ground while saying 'I'll never accept it.'"" Wang told prosecutors that Bo's physical violence against him as well as the disappearance of his aides and investigators led to his decision to seek refuge in the U.S. diplomatic mission in Chengdu. When Bo was allowed to question the witness, Wang revealed in an exchange that Gu had told him about her intention to kill a day before the murder. And when Bo asked Wang: ""Did you think I was forcing you out in an attempt to cover up (my wife's murder) case?"" Wang replied: ""Yes."" Embezzlement and corruption charges . Earlier Saturday, Bo kept up his vigorous defence against embezzlement charges and, as he did Friday on corruption charges, dismissed testimony from his jailed wife as a desperate attempt to reduce her own sentencing, prompting observers to revel in the intimate details of the extravagant life of an estranged couple once called ""the Kennedys of China."" Gu is serving a suspended death sentence for killing British businessman and family friend Neil Heywood in a Chongqing hotel room in November 2011. She gave her testimony to the court via video and has said that Bo was well aware of multimillion-dollar dealings to fund their and their younger son's jet-setting lifestyle. ""I have feelings for Gu Kailai,"" Bo said Saturday morning, after admitting to an extramarital affair. ""She is a vulnerable woman... and who else could she turn in? That's why all accusations against me originated from her."" Prosecutors allege that Bo received five million renminbi ($820,000) of public funds from a local urban planning official in Dalian, Liaoning Province, in the early 2000s when he was mayor and later the provincial governor. Bo slammed the allegations as ""contradictory"" and denied that he needed to take the money as his wife earned millions of dollars from her five law firms. Under the bribery indictment, prosecutors accuse Bo of using his political posts to secure influence for others. They say that between 2000 and 2012, Bo, Gu and their son, Bo Guagua, received about 22 million renminbi ($3.6 million) in bribes from businessmen in Dalian. Timeline: Bo Xilai scandal . Bo's fall from grace . Bo is a princeling, a term that refers to the children of revolutionary veterans who boast of political connections and influence. His late father, Bo Yibo, was a revolutionary contemporary of Mao Zedong and former leader Deng Xiaoping. Over the past three decades, Bo rose to power as a city mayor, provincial governor, minister of commerce and member of the Politburo, the powerful policymaking body of the Communist Party. A charismatic and urbane politician, Bo was credited with a spectacular, albeit brutal, crackdown on organized crime during his time as the top party official of Chongqing. Bo's glittering career, in which he drew admirers and detractors for his populist policies, fell apart last year amid a scandal involving murder, corruption and betrayal. Ex-police chief Wang's attempted defection precipitated Bo's political demise. Soon after news of the events began to emerge, Bo was removed from his Party posts. After his wife's sentencing last August, Wang was convicted of bending the law for selfish ends, defection, abuse of power and bribe-taking. He received a 15-year prison sentence. Bo's trial is seen as a potentially concluding chapter in the scandal. His high profile and connections among the nation's ruling elite have made his case -- with its tales of greed and wrongdoing by a top official and his family -- an extremely delicate matter for Chinese authorities. It's taken more than a year, during which time the Communist Party underwent a major leadership change, to bring him to trial. Many observers had expected proceedings to stick closely to a pre-planned script, seeing the trial's outcome as the result of a political deal struck between Bo and China's top leaders. But as he often did in his political career, Bo has so far stolen the show, mounting a robust attack on the prosecution's case and ridiculing witness testimony. That has left China watchers trying to figure out how far he's veered off script. Journalists from the international news media haven't been allowed inside the courtroom. But the court's official microblog account has delivered updates on developments inside, attracting almost half a million followers on Weibo, China's Twitter-like service. CNN hasn't been able to verify how accurate and comprehensive the court's version of proceedings has been. But many observers have interpreted it as a reasonably close, albeit filtered, account. CNN's Jethro Mullen, David McKenzie, Jaime FlorCruz contributed to this report.","Bo trial wraps up third day Saturday in Jinan .

"(CNN) -- Some of the most important turning points in the struggle for justice have occurred when individuals in our three branches of government courageously did the right thing by standing up against injustice. In the 1960s, Attorney General Robert Kennedy marshaled the power of the federal government to protect protesters at pivotal moments in the civil rights movement. Rep. Charles ""Mac"" Mathias, a Maryland Republican, bucked his party and reached across the aisle to help draft the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Alabama Federal District Court Judge Frank Johnson and the judges of the old Fifth Circuit helped to end legal segregation and enforce voting rights in the South despite much resistance. Last week, in the midst of our preparations for the 50th anniversary commemoration of the 1963 March on Washington, the civil rights community was heartened to see two modern-day versions of this kind of courage and commitment to justice. Attorney General Eric Holder and Federal District Court Judge Shira Scheindlin landed a one-two blow against mandatory minimums and ""stop and frisk"" racial profiling. Holder announced that the Justice Department would no longer seek severe mandatory sentences for low-level nonviolent drug offenders with no ties to gangs or large-scale drug organizations. Citing a report that black male offenders have received sentences nearly 20% longer than those imposed on white males convicted of similar crimes, Holder said, ""This isn't just unacceptable -- it is shameful. It's unworthy of our great country, and our great legal tradition."" It was inspiring, gratifying and satisfying to hear the nation's top law enforcement officer publicly recognize that mandatory minimum sentencing is wrong, overburdens our federal prison system and wreaks havoc on our communities. Why some movements work and others wilt . In short, mandatory minimums have been a near disaster. On the same day that Holder made his announcement, another courageous public servant also did the right thing by striking down as unconstitutional New York City's notorious practice of ""stop and frisk."" Judge Shira Scheindlin found that between 2004 and 2012, the New York City Police Department made 4.4 million stops. Eighty-three percent of these stops were of blacks and Hispanics, even though they make up only 52% of the population. In 88% of these stops, the individual was found innocent of any wrongdoing and in 98.5% of the frisks, no weapon was found. Judge Scheindlin's decision followed the tradition of great judges who upheld civil rights. And, in conjunction with Holder's announcement, it offers the promise of a new approach to law enforcement in the United States -- smarter, saner more humane strategies that are tough on crime without targeting, tormenting and demeaning people and communities of color. We received a strong message from the executive and judicial branches. It is now time for the third branch of government -- Congress -- to adopt measures that address crime while protecting civil and human rights. Congress took an important step three years ago with the passage of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, which reduced the sentencing disparity between offenses for crack and powder cocaine from 100:1 to 18:1. However, that law applied only to future crimes, and does not affect anyone convicted prior to enactment, an unfortunate gap in an otherwise worthy measure. Rethinking drug sentences comes too late for some . Congress should close this gap and take steps toward correcting and preventing the corrosive impact of mandatory minimums by passing the bipartisan Smarter Sentencing Act of 2013. Among other things, this act would make the Fair Sentencing Act retroactive to persons currently serving time for nonviolent drug crimes by allowing them to petition the courts for a review of their case. The bill would also reduce mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses, and give judges more discretion to determine sentences in nonviolent drug cases, enabling them to tailor the sentence to fit the particular crime and individual offender rather than forcing them to impose a ""one size fits all"" penalty. ""Our current scheme of mandatory minimum sentences is irrational and wasteful,"" said Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, who has co-sponsored the act with Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Illinois. The bipartisan support for the act offers hope for meaningful change and we strongly urge Congress to pass this measure as soon as possible. Opinion: Why did justice on incarceration take so long? Fifty years ago this month, hundreds of thousands of Americans of all ages, races, economic conditions and political persuasions lined up on the right side of history, marched on Washington and stepped into posterity. Today, every member of Congress has the opportunity to follow in their footsteps. If they look into their hearts and forward into history and honestly consider on which side of posterity they'd like to be at the 100th anniversary commemoration, they should know the right thing to do.

"(CNN) -- Hannah Anderson mourned alongside family, friends and strangers on Saturday at a public service remembering the lives of her slain mother, Christina, and little brother, Ethan. A crowd of about 500 filled every pew of Guardian Angels Catholic Church in Santee, California. Mourners listened as Father Kevin Casey opened the service with a prayer for the lives lost during the tragic incidents of August 4. ""We are here to pray for Tina and remember her, and for Ethan. Ethan doesn't need prayers. He is already an angel in heaven. And that is our great belief,"" he said, ""all of us would like to take away the awful pain that was inflicted on Hannah and on the whole family. We ask God for resurrection and light in this darkness and death."" Christina Anderson, 42, and her son, Ethan, 8, were killed by family friend James Lee DiMaggio, who then set fire to his house and kidnapped Hannah, authorities said. In the days after the kidnapping, a multistate manhunt ensued, ending hundreds of miles away from his San Diego-area home. On August 10, horseback riders spotted DiMaggio in the Idaho wilderness. An FBI agent shot him dead and Hannah was rescued. A playful snapshot of Christina and Ethan adorned the church altar, along with a photo of the family dog, Cali, also killed by DiMaggio. Their remains were held in urns, encircled by family photos, flower wreaths, cards and a football meant for Ethan. ""As you know, Ethan was so handsome, full of spirit, loved football,"" Hannah's great uncle, David Braun, said during the eulogy. ""What a kid to have as a son, or a brother, or a member of our family. You just wanted to be his buddy."" Several of Ethan's football teammates listened from the back of the church as Braun reflected on the life of the boy they knew. They wore their black and yellow football jerseys in honor of Ethan. Braun also spoke kindly of on his niece, whom he lovingly called ""Tiny Tina."" ""She was a devoted mother and a wonderful person to have in our family. Very devoted to her children, full of life and always ready to help out if you needed a friend or a favor,"" he said. Hannah, 16, listened from the front row, where she sat surrounded by her maternal grandparents, Sarah and Ralph Britt. Her grandmother had her arm around her for most of the service. ""We will miss them forever. We will always remember them and ask, 'What could have been?'"" said Braun. ""It has been very painful. It has been unending pain and sorrow,"" he said. ""We have all felt your pain in an every minute since this attack on our family transpired."" Braun thanked family members for their support, the media, the FBI and the ranchers who are credited for Hannah's rescue. He told the congregation Christina and Ethan will never be forgotten. ""They say only time will mend a broken heart but who knows, only time... but those we will those we love will never be more than a thought away. For as long as there is a memory, will live on in our heart."" Hannah arrived at the service with her father, Brett Anderson, in a black SUV. Before the start of the service, she greeted and hugged churchgoers and thanked them for their support, including several of her classmates who sat towards the back of the church. Hannah then joined her family and the congregation as it sang ""Amazing Grace"" and a procession gave way to the Holy Eucharist. CNN spoke to Hannah's grandmother after the service ended. Sarah Britt described the service as ""uplifting."" ""It was a chance to finally celebrate my daughter and my grandson. With waiting to find Hannah, we had to put our grief aside to this day. It was very uplifting and my daughter would have loved it,"" she said. Britt said Hannah ""did really well."" ""She is very strong. She had a few moments, but she is very strong,"" she said. Britt said she plans to raise Hannah, who has plans of becoming a firefighter. The family handed out a memorial card that included a prayer verse and a message that read: ""We express our heartfelt gratitude to all of you in our time of need. Thank you, The Anderson and Britt family."" The card included a photo of Christina and Ethan. Christina's death date was listed as August 3, and Ethan's as August 4.","Hannah Anderson attends her mother and brother's public memorial .

"(CNN) -- Woroud Sawalha knows she won't win a medal at the London Olympics. She isn't likely to get beyond the first round of the 800 meters. But for the 20-year-old and her three teammates, just competing under the Palestinian flag is a source of pride. The appearance itself is controversial: the U.N. does not recognize a Palestinian state but athletes have been allowed to compete under a Palestinian flag by the International Olympic Committee and soccer's ruling body FIFA since 1996 and 1998 respectively. ""It means a lot for me that I am female and representing Palestine,"" she told CNN's Aiming For Gold. ""I will represent my hometown Asira ash-Shamaliya, Palestine and my university."" Asira ash-Shamaliya is a village of fewer than 10,000 inhabitants in the northern West Bank, where protests and tear gas form part of everyday life in a region still fighting for independence from Israel after two decades of struggle. Sawalha, who will be immediately recognizable by her black headscarf, long-sleeved top and long trousers, knows that when she steps up to the line in London, she won't just be representing herself. ""This will reflect on my female friends and on sports in Palestine,"" she said. ""Maybe the view of girls will change from practicing sports in a more professional way and more freely in front of people."" The International Olympic Committee is hopeful that the 2012 Games will be the first to feature female athletes on every team. Three teams have never sent women. Palestinians have competed in the Olympics under their flag since 1996, sending their first female athlete in 2000. However, Sawalha believes the fact that she was only told six months ago that she would be going to London is a sign of how lightly women's sport is taken in the Palestinian territories. She had her first taste of top-level international competition earlier this year at the world indoor championships in Istanbul. She clocked two minutes 51.87 seconds in her heat for a personal best that was still more than 53 seconds slower than the gold medal-winning time. Given her lack of preparation and the scant training resources available in her homeland, Sawalha knows a medal is beyond her, so her target is to further improve her personal best. ""Miracles do happen, and with God's help I will hopefully get a good result,"" she said. ""Since they selected me for the Olympics, my running time has gone from four minutes to just under three, so I've seen a big improvement."" Training on pot-holed roads in Gaza, dodging cars and horses and carts, Bahaa al-Farra knows that only so much improvement is possible. Like Sawalha, the 400-meter runner must rely on an invitation from the IOC to compete in London because neither has reached the required qualifying standard. When he isn't running, al-Farra works out in a dingy public gym with shabby white concrete walls. ""I need a proper track to train on,"" he said. ""At the moment I just run on the roads or on sand. Also, proper starting blocks are unavailable in Gaza."" So when he arrives in London, he'll not only have the daunting prospect of a first Olympic Games to consider but he'll also have to quickly get accustomed to unfamiliar conditions. ""Hopefully, the lack of training tools won't affect me, and I can prove to the world that we can compete even without them,"" he said. For al-Farra, competing in London won't leave him completely fulfilled. He hopes it is only the start of a long athletics career. ""My dream is to become a world-known runner and compete with world champions in overseas competitions and hopefully I can achieve my dream in the near future,"" he said. ""My dream is to do something for Palestine and show the world that Palestine deserves to live and stand on the podium.""","Four Palestinian athletes will compete at the 2012 Olympics in London .

"(CNN) -- Will there be a second act? Theo Kingma, president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, said he hopes Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, the popular co-hosts of this year's Golden Globes, will return. However, representatives for the association, which hosts the event, declined to comment on whether the women have been approached or asked. The 71st Golden Globe awards ceremony is scheduled for Sunday, January 14. A representative for Poehler had no comment. From their laugh-out-loud opening quips to their improvised comebacks, old friends and ""Saturday Night Live"" alums Fey and Poehler got rave reviews for this year's performance in January. Right at the onset, Poehler -- the star of ""Parks and Recreation"" -- assured the audience that there would only be good-natured jokes during the broadcast, because as the more biting Ricky Gervais has shown, ""when you run afoul of the Hollywood Foreign Press, they make you host the show two more times."" Among their greatest hits: . • ""When it comes to torture, I trust the lady who spent three years married to James Cameron."" -- Poehler, referring to Kathryn Bigelow, the director of the movie ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" which stirred controversy over its portrayal of the torture of terror detainees. • ""I have not seen someone so totally alone and abandoned like that since you were on stage with James Franco at the Oscars."" -- Fey to Anne Hathaway about the latter's performance in ""Les Miserables."" • Their heckling, with liquor tumblers in hand, of Lena Dunham, who beat them for the best TV comedy actress award. • Introducing George Clooney: ""This next presenter is so handsome, he makes young George Clooney look like garbage.

"(CNN) -- Occasionally, at odd hours, you may find that you have a Waffle House all to yourself. This allows for silent contemplation. There is one notation on the ubiquitous restaurants' familiar laminated, double-sided menus that has long intrigued me. This summer I finally decided to look into why that notation is there, and the answer led, in a roundabout way, to an unexpected and beguiling tale of American business, and of fathers and sons. You really do learn something new every day. The omelets on all those Waffle House menus are not described as mere omelets. They are designated as ""Toddle House omelets."" The Toddle Houses -- they have been out of business for decades -- were a cherished institution in the middle of the 20th century. I must have eaten hundreds of Toddle House meals as a boy and young man. They were open 24 hours a day, and were bare-bones. A counter and 10 stools. No booths. No tables. A place you could depend on. I never quite understood how those original Toddle Houses could make any money with only 10 customers at a time, but they were heartland perfection (if not perfect for one's heart). Cheeseburgers, grilled cheese sandwiches, hash browns made on the grill right in front of you, breakfast round the clock, and the most mouthwatering chocolate icebox pie and banana cream pie imaginable. I can taste those pies right now, and it's been more than 40 years. The chain was based in Memphis, and, as mid-South historian Vance Lauderdale has written, ""Everything was gleaming steel or white tile, and crammed into the tiny space were fryers and ovens and broilers and toasters and -- well, just about everything needed to prepare anything from a cup of coffee to a steak dinner."" I thought the Toddle Houses had vanished from everywhere but my dreams -- yet they live on, on every Waffle House menu. And, because there are more than 1,600 Waffle Houses in the United States, there are a whole lot of Waffle House menus. To find out the reason for all of this, I got in touch with Waffle House headquarters, in Norcross, Georgia. I was told that there is no financial connection between Waffle House and the old Toddle House. But one of Waffle House's co-founders, Joe Rogers Sr., got his start as a Toddle House employee, and it was he who insisted on the Toddle House label on the omelets, as a fond and wistful homage to those lost little diners. Now. . . here's where the saga gets cool. I delved into Toddle House history. It turns out that the guy who built the Toddle Houses from nothing into a mid-century middle-American treasure was a fellow named Fred Smith. He had owned a bus company, had sold it, and had devoted his business acumen to the Toddle Houses. He died in the 1940s, leaving a 4-year-old son fatherless. The boy, also named Fred, went to college, joined the Marines, served two tours of duty in Vietnam, then came home and, like his dad had done, decided to start a company. It was based on an idea he had dreamed up while in school. It had nothing to do with the restaurant business. It was a little firm called Federal Express. How's that for a father-and-son success story? Toddle House and FedEx, sharing a common bloodline. It's one thing for a dad to teach his son the ropes in a family business, and hand it to him. And history is full of dads and their sons who have succeeded in the same field. John and John Quincy Adams, and George H.W. and George W. Bush, became presidents of the United States. Archie Manning and his sons Peyton and Eli all became National Football League quarterbacks. Bobby Hull and his son Brett are both hockey hall-of-famers. Kirk Douglas was a Hollywood leading man, and so is his son, Michael. But those sons followed their fathers into the same job. The first Fred Smith, though, was long dead by the time the second Fred Smith determined that he wanted to go into business. There must be something genetic about the creative business urge (or something in the Memphis water); the first Fred wasn't around to teach the second Fred how to do it, yet the Smiths built two completely different kinds of companies that on a national scale successfully fulfilled completely different consumer needs. And I just realized something: . Nine years ago, when a lifelong friend was dying of cancer and we who grew up with him and loved him were gathering to bid him farewell, we tried to think up a gift that would mean something special to him. I found, online, an antique shop in the South that had on hand an old dinner plate from a Toddle House (the slogan of the restaurants, modest yet confident, was: ""Good as the Best."" The slogan was baked into every plate). We'd had so many Toddle House meals together, sitting shoulder-to-shoulder on those stools at the counter. We knew what the gift would represent to him. We were all going to sign the plate for our friend, so he could keep it on a shelf near his bed. But time was short. We didn't have the luxury of waiting. So I asked the antique shop owners if there was a way they could get it to us quickly. There was. They sent it FedEx. It arrived the next day, for us to sign and present to him. After he passed away, his wife did me the kindness of giving me the sturdy old Toddle House plate, complete with all of our signatures on it -- and his. I'm looking at it as I type these words. I realize only now that it was the first Fred Smith's prized product, brought safely to us by his son. What a country. Sometimes you have to just smile and shake your head. (Now, if there was only some way for FedEx to deliver a slice of that long-gone Toddle House banana cream pie. . . .)

"(CNN) -- San Diego Mayor Bob Filner is resigning in the face of a torrent of sexual harassment claims -- though he's not going out quietly. City Attorney Jan Goldsmith announced around 3:45 p.m. (6:45 p.m. ET) that the City Council, during a closed-door session, had accepted the terms of an agreement with Filner that was reached after three days of mediation talks. Filner submitted a ""signed resignation"" that ""the city has accepted"" in a 7-0 vote by council members, Goldsmith said. That resignation will take effect at 5 p.m. Friday, August 30. After that vote, Filner spoke at the City Council meeting -- his first extensive public comments in weeks -- and began by offering a ""deep apology ... to all the citizens."" ""The city should not have been put through this,"" the 70-year-old mayor said. ""And my own personal failures were responsible."" A short time later, though, Filner went on the defensive. While admitting that his behavior toward women was inappropriate at times, he insisted that he ""never sexually harassed anyone."" In the process of ""trying to establish personal relationships,"" the mayor explained, ""the combination of awkwardness and hubris, I think, led to behavior that many found offensive."" He added, ""Not one allegation ... has ever been independently verified or proven in court."" ""But the hysteria that has been created ... is the hysteria of a lynch mob,"" Filner said, criticizing an environment in which ""rumors become allegations, allegations become facts, facts become evidence of sexual harassment which have led to demands for my resignation and recall."" Blasting politicians and members of the media who ""unleashed a monster,"" the mayor said, ""The hysteria ended up playing into the hands of those who wanted a political coup -- the removal of a democratically elected mayor purely by rumor and innuendo."" ""They found the weapons they needed in my own failures as a human being,"" Filner said of ""well-organized interests"" opposed to him. ""But they found with those weapons and they used them, in a bloody and vicious way."" The outgoing mayor's remarks -- going from a contrite apology to a withering attack -- left many watching from inside City Hall stunned, according to a source who was there. The comment about his being the victim of a ""coup"" especially caught people off guard. ""We are shocked that he would go there,"" said the source inside City Hall. This defiant stance notwithstanding, it doesn't change the fact that Filner's term as mayor ends -- according to a deal he agreed to -- next week. And when it does, City Council President Todd Gloria will step in on an interim basis. Gloria said Friday afternoon, after the council session, that he'll soon begin work on setting up a special election. Speaking shortly after Filner, Gloria -- who, along with the other eight council members, had demanded Filner's resignation -- said that he believes the ""settlement represents an end to our civil nightmare, and it allows our city to begin to heal."" ""San Diego is back,"" the incoming interim mayor said later. ""We are America's greatest city, and we always will be."" The agreement signed off on Friday does not affect a lawsuit brought against Filner by Irene McCormack Jackson, the mayor's former communications chief, according to Goldsmith. Jackson left her job when she sued the mayor in July -- saying he had subjected women to ""crude and disgusting"" comments and inappropriate touching -- but remains a municipal employee, Goldsmith noted. He said Friday that the city will continue to engage in mediation talks with Jackson and her lawyer, Gloria Allred. Under the mediation agreement, San Diego will dismiss its cross-complaint against Filner in relation to that lawsuit, the city attorney said. Meet Filner's accusers . Goldsmith also said that, for any claims brought against San Diego and Filner for his alleged conduct while mayor, ""the city will provide a joint legal defense through the city attorney's office for the city and Mr. Filner."" Friday's announcement marks the latest milestone in a saga that has gripped San Diego for seven weeks, when the first in what would be 18 women came forward publicly to accuse Filner -- during his time as congressman and, since 2012, as mayor -- of inappropriate behavior. Numerous public officials, including all nine city council members and the state's two U.S. Senators, urged Filner to step down. So, too, did a majority of locals, according to polls. Some of them voiced that view to city council members Friday, before they convened in private session to make their decision on the agreement. Other speakers also rose to support Filner. Scott Andrews claimed ""everything but due process has occurred,"" while one woman called what's happening ""a circus to get a good man out of office."" A few offered sympathy for the council members, given what they and other municipal leaders have dealt with in recent weeks and the decision that lay ahead. ""It is really about the city that we all love,"" said Laurie Black, a longtime civic leader. ""And make your decision with the intentions of loving your city."" Even once Filner leaves office, the city could bear the repercussions of his alleged behavior. As Goldsmith noted, the city can be held liable for the actions of its employees -- including its past and present mayor. Filner, himself, is hardly out of the woods. While he now only faces one lawsuit, others could follow. Plus, there's the chance that the congressman-turned-mayor could be prosecuted by local, state or federal authorities. Speaking to that point after news of the resignation became official, California Attorney General's office spokesman Nick Pacilio said, ""We can confirm a criminal investigation is underway.""

"(CNN) -- Maria Sharapova took aim at arch-rival Serena Williams Saturday as she told the World No.1 to stick to tennis rather than courting controversy. Earlier this week, Williams had to apologize for comments she made to Rolling Stone magazine over the rape of a 16-year-old girl by two high school American football players in Ohio. Eyebrows were also raised in the same article over a passage which appeared to reference Sharapova. It accused an unnamed player of being ""boring"" and made unflattering remarks about her choice of boyfriend. Sharapova is dating Bulgarian tennis player Grigo Dimitrov. Sharapova, the third seed at Wimbledon and bidding for her first title at SW19 since 2004, used the pre-tournament media conference to hit back. ""We have a tremendous amount of respect for what we do on the court. I just think she should be talking about her accomplishments, her achievements, rather than everything else that's just getting attention and controversy,' the Russian was quoted by the UK's Press Association. ""If she wants to talk about something personal, maybe she should talk about her relationship and her boyfriend that was married and is getting a divorce and has kids. ""(She should) talk about other things, but not draw attention to other things. She has so much in her life, many positives, and I think that's what it should be about."" 16-time grand slam winner Williams is reportedly in a relationship with her French coach Patrick Mouratoglou, but neither has spoken publicly about it. She has won three of last four grand slams under his guidance, the latest at the French Open where she beat defending champion Sharapova in a hard-fought final in Paris. On Tuesday, Williams came under fire, particularly on Twitter and other social media, when her reported remarks to Rolling Stone about the rape were made public on its website. ""She's 16, why was she that drunk where she doesn't remember? It could have been much worse. She's lucky. Obviously, I don't know, maybe she wasn't a virgin, but she shouldn't have put herself in that position, unless they slipped her something, then that's different,"" she was quoted. The following day, Williams released a statement on her personal website, saying she was ""deeply sorry for what was written in the Rolling Stone article. What was written -- what I supposedly said -- is insensitive and hurtful, and I by no means would say or insinuate that she was at all to blame,"" it said. Sharapova said Williams would do well to steer clear of such issues. ""I obviously have many opinions about different things in life,"" she said. ""But what I do on the court and what I talk about in my press conference is strictly about my career. I'm sure people want to know more, but yet I try to keep my personal life private. ""If I speak to my friends, that's one thing. But I don't go out and try to create things that shouldn't be really talked about."" Meanwhile, in the pre-Wimbledon warm-up tournament at Eastbourne, Sharapova's compatriot Elena Vesnina took the title, beating Jamie Hampton of the United States in the final. Simona Halep of Romania also warmed up by taking the title in s-Hertogenbosch in the Netherlands with a straight sets win over Kirsten Flipkens of Belgium. Frenchman Nicolas Mahut, renowned for his world record marathon match with John Isner at Wimbledon in 2010, took his maiden ATP title at the same event. He beat favorite Stanislas Wawrinka of Switzerland, also in straight sets. .","Maria Sharapova hits out at World No.1 Serena Williams .

"(CNN) -- Five-time champion Roger Federer breezed through a potentially testing first round match at the U.S. Open Tuesday to lift some of the pessimism surrounding his latest title bid. The grand slam singles record holder, seeded as low as seventh after an indifferent 2013, had too much know how for Slovenian Grega Zemlja in winning 6-3 6-2 7-5. A shock second round exit at Wimbledon and injury concerns left many doubting 32-year-old Federer would be a major factor as he bids for this 18th slam. But in a match carried over from Monday due to bad weather, the Swiss maestro was always on top. His only hiccup came when he surrendered a break in the third set before eventually closing out the match on the Arthur Ashe Stadium Court. He will play Argentina's Carlos Berlocq in the second round, with a possible quarterfinals against No.2 seed Rafael Nadal on the horizon. ""I felt great,"" Federer said. ""Day sesion or night session it doesn't really matter when you play on Arthur Ashe Court,"" he told fans. Top seed and world No. 1 Novak Djokovic made short work of his first round opponent, defeating Lithuanian Ricardas Berankis 6-1 6-2 6-2 in 81 minutes. The 2011 champion hit 28 winners in the match and dropped his serve in the third set, but recovered to break back in the next game to serve out a routine victory. Djokovic only needs to reach the semi-finals to retain his top ranking. He faces Germany's Benjamin Becker in the second round. Wimbledon semifinalist and 14th seed Jerzy Janowicz was knocked out in the first round at Flushing Meadows for the second year in a row, losing in straight sets to Argentina's Maximo Gonzalez. In the women's draw 2011 champion Samantha Stosur was stunned by 17-year-old Victoria Duval, surrendering a one-set lead to lose 5-7 6-4 6-4 to the 296th-ranked American. Duval, who lost in the first round of last year's event to Kim Clijsters, was delighted with her own performance. ""I think I played amazing today -- it was incredible, the whole match was just really an incredible match and I'm happy I pulled it through,"" the Miami-born starlet told the WTA's official website. ""Obviously it's a great feeling to beat a past champion. And Sam is amazing. Although she didn't play nearly her best today, I played amazing, so I'll take it!"" Former Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova and former World No.1 Caroline Wozniacki both withstood testing challenges from Asian players in their first round matches. Seventh seed Czech Kvitova, the 2011 winner at Wimbledon, dropped the middle set against Japan's Misaki Doi before going through 6-2 3-6 6-1. Wozniacki, being supported at Flushing Meadows by golfing boyfriend Rory McIlroy, had a slightly easier task against Chinese qualifier Duan Ying-Ying. But having won the first set 6-2, the Danish sixth seed trailed by a break in the second before recovering to close out it out 7-5. Another former No.1, Serbia's Ana Ivanovic, also showed good early form with a straight sets win over Georgian Anna Tatishvili 6-2 6-0. Victoria Azarenka powered through her opening match in little more than one hour, handing her German opponent Dinah Pfizenmaier a double donut -- winning 6-0 6-0. The No. 2 seed will face Aleksandra Wozniak in the next round.","Roger Federer wins opener at U.S. Open .

"Fort Hood, Texas (CNN) -- The only question left for the jury considering the case of Army Maj. Nidal Hasan is whether he will live or die for targeting Afghanistan-bound soldiers in one of the largest mass killings of military personnel on a post on U.S. soil. Jurors deliberated less than seven hours over two days before finding Hasan guilty Friday on 13 counts of murder and 32 counts of all charges in connection with the November 5, 2009, shootings at a deployment process center. The Army psychiatrist admitted to targeting soldiers, saying previously he wanted to protect the Taliban and its leaders from the U.S. military. The court-martial moves on Monday to the penalty phase, where Hasan -- acting as his own attorney as he did during the trial -- will have the opportunity to address the jurors considering whether he should be executed for his actions. The big question is whether Hasan will take the stand in the penalty phase after declining to testify himself, cross-examine witnesses or give a closing statement. The American-born Muslim has indicated in documents leaked to the media that the death penalty would allow him to become a ""martyr."" For a family member of at least one of Hasan's victims, the death penalty ""would be too lenient."" Fort Hood victims feel betrayed . ""I would much rather see him sit in prison for the rest of his life. He shouldn't be allowed to dictate what happens. He wants to motivate other terrorists,"" Joshua Gadlin told CNN by telephone. ""...We need to stop him from being martyr"" to terrorists. Gadlin's wife, former Army Pvt. Amber Bahr Gadlin dragged a wounded soldier out of the deployment processing center as Hasan targeted people in uniform with his laser-mounted weapon. He shot her in the back. Today, the outer wounds have healed. It's the unseen ones -- the emotional scars of that day -- that haven't, Gadlin said. 'Remember the day' At this sprawling 350-square mile Army post in central Texas, the case has routinely dominated the headlines of the local newspaper and television stations. For many here, there was life before the rampage, one where there was the reality that loved ones could die or be wounded while fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq. Then there was life after -- after loved ones were gunned down by a fellow soldier. ""You don't hear people talking about it all the time, but you think about it,"" said Paula Wells, who said works on the Army post in a civilian capacity. ""I remember the day it happened, and it was shocking. Here the guys go to war and come back, and they get killed here. It isn't supposed to happen that way."" But it did, for those who survived and the families of those who did not. Soldier on soldier attacks . In Lacey, Washington, tears rolled down Autumn Manning's face when she learned that Hasan was found guilty of shooting her husband, Staff Sgt. Shawn Manning, six times. ""I've been crying all day, like most of the victims have, but it's a sense of relief. This is just the start for the victims because we have sentencing,"" she told CNN by telephone. Manning's husband was one of the nearly 90 witnesses who testified for the prosecution during 12 days of testimony, delivering a horrifying account of the massacre as Hasan stared at him. Manning, 37, was in the deployment processing center, texting his wife as he awaited his turn, when someone in front of him shouted ""Allahu akbar"" -- Arabic for ""God is the greatest"" -- and began firing. He described his bullet wounds, including one that pierced part of a lung. ""I figured the shooter would finish me off,"" Manning said. The two -- Hasan and Manning -- locked eyes as the staff sergeant identified the major as the man who shot him. Manning's wife, who watched the testimony from the gallery, said there was a relief when it was over. Much had been made about whether Hasan, who was acting as his own attorney, would cross-examine the witnesses, including her husband. ""I was pretty angry. I was anxious all week not knowing if he was going to cross-examine my husband or not, and not sure how my husband will deal with that,"" she said. ""I noticed he was making eye contact with my husband, and that just infuriated me."" Inside the courtroom, shortly before the verdict was delivered, the judge cautioned the spectators in the gallery against outbursts. Hasan stroked his beard as the jury -- a military panel of 13 senior officers -- filed into the courtroom. He then looked at the head of the jury -- a colonel -- who affirmed a verdict had been reached. Hasan showed no emotion as the verdict was read, a contrast to a handful of some of family members who cried or gave one another brief hugs. 'A first, small step down the path of justice' ""Today's guilty verdict, rendered almost four years after the attack, is only a first, small step down the path of justice for the victims,"" said attorney Neal M. Sher, who represents victims and families of those killed in a compensation claim against the government for failing to stop the attack. Almost immediately after the attacks, there were widespread questions about how Hasan was evaluated, promoted and transferred to Fort Hood with plans to deploy to Afghanistan despite questions about his actions, including giving an academic presentation on the value of suicide bombings. Sher renewed the call for the government to reclassify the shootings as a ""terror attack"" rather than workplace violence. ""Justice for the victims of Fort Hood will be done only when the government admits its mistakes, keeps its promises to 'make the victims whole' and comes clean about Fort Hood, "" Sher said. "" The victims, and the American people, are owed nothing less."" As has been done nearly every day in the three-week court-martial, the judge asked Hasan if he had reconsidered defending himself as the case enters the penalty phase. Jurors ""will decide whether you live or die,"" the judge, Col. Tara Osborn, told Hasan after reconvening the court Monday afternoon as part of the penalty phase preparation. ""...I think it is unwise for you to represent yourself."" Hasan told the judge he intended to continue representing himself in the case. 'Jihad duty to kill' On Thursday afternoon, the judge handed the case to the jury after Hasan declined to make a statement during closing arguments that followed 12 days of testimony. The prosecution urged the jury to convict, saying the evidence showed that Hasan believed he had a jihad duty to kill as many soldiers as possible. For more than 90 minutes, the prosecutor took the jury methodically through the evidence in the case, meticulously piecing together how he said Hasan prepared and planned for the attack. Prosecutors have maintained that the American-born Muslim underwent a progressive radicalization that led to the massacre at the sprawling central Texas base. ""He did not want to deploy, and he came to believe he had a jihad duty to kill as many soldiers as possible,"" Col. Steven Henricks told the jury. Hasan picked the day -- November 5, 2009 -- because it was when the units he was scheduled to deploy with to Afghanistan were scheduled to go through the processing center, he said. Hasan rested his case without calling a single witness or taking the stand to testify on his own behalf. His decision not to offer a defense was an anticlimactic end to the trial in which prosecution witnesses, primarily survivors, painted a horrific picture of what unfolded inside a processing center during the attack. During closing arguments, prosecutors showed a graphic FBI video of the crime scene hours after the rampage, where bodies, blood and bullets still covered the floor. As the video was shown to the jury, some of the family members of those killed fought back tears. One woman laid her head on her husband's shoulder, tears streaming down her cheeks, while another woman, a wife of a victim, left the courtroom. For his part, Hasan watched the video, appearing to pay close attention . Hasan's defense . Much has been made of Hasan's defense or, as his stand-by attorneys have said, the lack of it. The judge, Osborn, declined a request by Hasan's attorneys to drop out of the case. The attorneys argued that Hasan was helping the prosecution put him to death. There may be something to that claim. Hasan took credit for the shooting rampage at the outset of the trial, telling the jury during opening statements that the evidence will show ""I was the shooter."" Osborn barred Hasan from pleading guilty at the start of the court-martial. Under military law, defendants cannot enter guilty pleas in capital punishment cases. The judge refused to allow Hasan to argue ""defense of others,"" based on his claim that he carried out the shootings to protect the Afghan Taliban and its leaders from U.S. soldiers. Perhaps as a way around that ruling, Hasan in recent days has leaked documents through his civilian attorney to The New York Times and Fox News that offer a glimpse of his justification for carrying out the attack. Among the documents was a mental health evaluation conducted by a military panel to determine whether Hasan was fit to stand trial. ""I'm paraplegic and could be in jail for the rest of my life. However, if I died by lethal injection, I would still be a martyr,"" he told the panel, according to pages of the report published by The New York Times. The judge excluded much of the evidence that the prosecution contends goes to the heart of the motive for the attack, including e-mail communications between Hasan and Anwar al-Awlaki, the U.S.-born cleric who officials say became a key member of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. He was killed in a U.S. drone strike in 2011.","The jury that convicted Nidal Hasan in the Fort Hood shootings will decide his fate .
The penalty phase begins on Monday .
Death penalty ""would be too lenient,"" says the husband of one victim .
Hasan has indicated the death penalty would allow him to become a ""martyr"""
"(CNN)  -- Esra'a al Shafei, a recent university graduate in Bahrain, is young, Muslim and frustrated. Young Muslims, pictured here in Afghanistan, are increasingly using technology to engage the world. The 23-year-old says the complexity of who she is as a Muslim is being distorted by extremists and the media coverage of them. Channeling her frustration, she started Mideastyouth.com, a Web site she describes as a place for young people in the region to ""show a different side of our religion"" and discuss topics big and small, taboo and not. She represents a generation of Muslims who are using technology to express themselves, connect with others, challenge traditional power structures and create an identity in an era when Islamic extremists often grab the headlines. ""I think the word that clearly defines the younger generation and also separates them from their parents is 'globalized,'"" said Reza Aslan, the author of two books on Islam, including the recently published ""How to Win a Cosmic War: God, Globalization and the End of the War on Terror."" Access to technology lags in countries with large Muslim populations compared with Europe and the United States. Access also varies between those countries depending on a variety of factors such as governmental control and economic development. But the numbers of people using the Web and cell phones are growing -- and quickly. ""The percentage increases of Internet users in places like Iran, Pakistan and Egypt are astronomical during the past five years,"" Aslan said. A recent study by Forrester Research predicted growth rates for Web usage would continue to soar in the region during the next five years. A battle over interpretation . Al Shafei, who spoke to CNN by phone from Bahrain, said her Islamic identity was partly shaped by a childhood that included Christian classmates and American and British teachers. She also grew up in a country that was relatively progressive enough to appoint a female Jewish ambassador recently. ""Islam is much more relaxed here,"" she said. ""But it doesn't mean we're not good Muslims."" She discovered blogs, and the more she read, the more she grew frustrated with the nature of the dialogue. ""No one was talking to each other,"" she said. The conflict between Hezbollah and Israel in 2006 was the turning point for her. ""I was really annoyed by how the Western and Arab media were covering it,"" she said. ""Both sides were sticking to the extremes."" She said she started her Web site that year to provide the world -- and media -- a different perspective on Islam. ""We're not as simplistic as the media would often make of us,"" she said. Al Shafei said the Web site's discussion subjects range from the political to the taboo, including homosexuality, premarital sex and atheism. The anonymity provided by the Web helps foster such discussion, she said. She is, however, careful to avoid talking about some topics, which could get her in trouble. ""I always remind myself that I have my limitations,"" she said. ""There are various issues that I am unable to tackle for security reasons."" Al Shafei said she hopes that Web sites such as hers could help fight extremist Islamic groups by defeating their arguments through cultural and religious dialogue. But she concedes there's catching up to do. ""We have to move faster"" because extremist groups are more widespread in traditional media such as newspapers and radio stations, which are still consumed by more people than new media such as Web sites, she said. The extremists' lure . Some extremists are adept at using technology and new media as well. The killings of journalist Daniel Pearl, U.S. businessman Nicholas Berg and Eugene Armstrong, an American contractor working in Iraq, were all recorded and later broadcast on the Web. It's long been a concern that the Web is being used by extremist groups such as al Qaeda to recruit young Muslims to their cause. However, Bruce Etling, who co-authored recent studies of the Arabic and Persian blogospheres at Harvard University's Berkman Center for Internet & Society, said he found little evidence of such activity. ""In the Arabic blogosphere we found no specific clusters related to extremism, and when it was discussed, it tended to be in negative terms,"" he said. ""It was a counter-narrative we were surprised to find."" There are several possible reasons why, he explained. It's difficult for extremist groups to maintain a static presence on the Web -- they constantly have to move to avoid being found. Additionally, popular sites such as Facebook have strict terms of usage, which make it difficult for extremist groups -- and their sympathizers -- to build a following. Aslan, who is also the executive editor of the social-networking Web site Mecca.com, said that research has consistently shown that the Internet is not an effective recruiting tool for extremists. He said extremist groups use the Web more as a marketing and communication tool. ""Nobody, absolutely nobody, straps a bomb on their body because they were recruited from the Internet,"" he said. ""It takes an enormous amount of personal face-to-face contact and time in order to recruit a young person into the cause of jihad."" The Web and the streets . Observers say that like other young people around the world, Muslims mostly use technology such as cell phones and the Web for social and recreational reasons, not political. Jared Cohen traveled through the Middle East from 2004 through 2006 for his book, ""Children of Jihad: A Young American's Travels Among the Youth of the Middle East."" He joined the U.S. State Department in September, 2006. He said his travels showed him that the same tools young Muslims are using to socialize also are helping them organize. While at an underground party in Iran a few years ago, he asked the Iranians how they heard about the gathering. They told him that if he were to go to the marketplace during the day and turn on his Bluetooth, he could receive random messages with details on where to go and at what time. Western-style parties and music are prohibited in Iran, so young people hold them secretly to evade security. Cohen said the partygoers were dismissive when asked if they were afraid of the security forces finding out. ""No one over 30 knows what Bluetooth does,"" the young Iranians told him. That knowledge and tech savviness played a significant role in the recent protests after the disputed Iranian election. Protesters used Twitter, cell phones and other social-networking tools to organize and spread word of what was happening on the streets. The impact on Islam: A new identity? The post-election fallout in Iran is one example that portends a broader generational and hierarchical struggle in the Muslim community, some experts say. There are a lot of young Muslims. By some estimates, about 60 percent of Muslims in the Middle East are under the age of 30. ""What the printing press is to Christianity in the 16th century, that's what the Internet is doing to Islam now,"" Aslan said. ""It has opened up the monopoly over the interpretation of Islam that used to solely belong to the religious class."" Some clerical authorities, well aware of the challenges posed to their influence by the powers of the Web, are becoming more tech savvy and are building a digital presence, Aslan says. But their interpretations and authority increasingly have competition from sites created by young Muslims such as al Shafei and online communities found on Facebook and Twitter. However, emerging technology also could be a force that helps forge a new, more global Islamic identity. Syrian Muslims can now talk to Muslims in Pakistan, Indonesia, the U.S. or Europe. ""During the 20th century, the parents of this generation were struggling to define for themselves some conception of a pan-Arab or pan-Muslim unity,"" Aslan said. ""But that was elusive because there are so many things geopolitically that separate the Muslim world. ""With the Internet, those boundaries, those borders are irrelevant.""","The number of young Muslims using the Web is rising, experts say .
They're using it to express themselves and connect with others .
These tools also are providing a way to organize socially and politically ."
"(Mashable) -- Super Bowl XLVI host city Indianapolis has concocted a new way to deal with the madness that comes with managing the world's biggest annual sporting event. The solution? The Super Bowl's first-ever social media command center. A team of strategists, analysts and techies will monitor the digital fan conversation via Facebook, Twitter and other platforms from a 2,800-square-foot space downtown. The station was set to open on Monday and run through Super Bowl XLVI on February 5. The team will tweet directions to fans in search of parking, direct visitors to Indianapolis's best attractions, and stand by to provide information in case of a disaster. ""Social media is just how people interact now,"" said Taulbee Jackson, CEO of Raidious, the digital marketing agency that the Super Bowl's host committee tapped to manage the communications hub. ""We felt it was critical to have some horsepower behind that aspect of the Super Bowl here, versus what you might have seen from other Super Bowls."" Some 150,000 people are expected to flood into downtown Indianapolis -- where the game will be played at Lucas Oil Stadium -- over Super Bowl weekend. Advanced search tools and analytics will help Jackson and his team identify fans in need of help by indexing key words and phrases. For example, a fan won't need to tweet, ""where can I find parking?"" to get help; Raidious operatives will be able to pick up on a general phrase such as ""parking sucks"" to offer assistance. But it won't be a simple operation. The command center will utilize more than a mile of Ethernet cable and more than 150 square feet of networked screen space. More than 20 people will man the center for 15 hours per day. Researchers from nearby Ball State University's Center for Media Design will conduct a study of the command center, analyzing its strengths and weaknesses. Michael Holmes, director of the center's Insight & Research Unit, wrote in an email that the command center is an example of the ""the ubiquity of social media and the absolute necessity for companies, organizations and communities to use these tools to improve their relations with their customer, audiences and citizens."" Both Holmes and Jackson said they would not be surprised if the Super Bowl's first designated social-media warroom sets a precedent for other major events. ""We're kind of breaking new ground here so we don't know the exact numbers yet of what we'll be dealing with, but we should be able to provide that after the game to other cities that have to deal with these types of issues,"" Jackson said.

"(EW.com) -- Back in 2004, Edgar Wright's brilliantly subversive zombie comedy, ""Shaun of the Dead,"" introduced American audiences to Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. On screen the British Mutt-and-Jeff duo (who teamed up again with Wright for 2007's ""Hot Fuzz"") had the spark-spraying chemistry of two best mates who wasted their youth finishing each other's sentences at the local pub. Now they've all reunited for their third — and best — collaboration, ""The World's End."" As in their previous comedies, Pegg and Frost play men who refuse to stop acting like boys. But these pint-swilling Peter Pans also know how to work the heart and the brain for belly laughs. Pegg stars as Gary, a pathetic screwup still living in the past who cons his four closest childhood pals (Frost, Martin Freeman, Paddy Considine, and Eddie Marsan) into returning to their quaint hometown after 20-odd years to reenact what he calls the best night of his life: an Odyssean 12-pub crawl ending at a watering hole named the World's End. Pegg's Gary is a selfish cad, not to mention a raging alcoholic, but Wright's film throws in a jarringly apocalyptic sci-fi twist about the hamlet's nonhuman denizens that gives him — and his stuck-in-a-rut buddies — a hilarious opportunity for midlife redemption. Wright doesn't quite stick the landing: The finale is a little too shaggy and silly. But what do you expect after a dozen beers? Grade: B+ . See the original story at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- Google Maps are getting personal. The next version of the widely used maps tool, previewed on Wednesday at the Google I/O conference in San Francisco, will soon have a different look and some splashy new features including displays of real-time accidents and personalized recommendations. The new Maps is only in beta, but people interested in testing it can sign up for an invitation at google.com/maps/preview. Here's a closer look at the new upgrades: . Customized maps . Each click subtly alters the map so it displays more personalized information, highlighting things that are relevant specifically to the person searching and what they're looking for. Click on a sandwich shop and a box appears showing details such as reviews from Zagat and your friends. Related eateries nearby pop up on the map. Using your search history, reviews and network of friends, Google makes recommendations of places it thinks you will enjoy. The more you use the map, the more data it collects for these types of recommendations. Google is also adding offers for companies like Starbucks, so when you look up where the nearest coffee shop is you can stumble into a coupon for $2 off your next Frappuccino. Smarter navigation . Navigation has always been one of Google Maps' strong points, particularly when it comes to alternative forms of transportation like public transit and biking. A collection of navigation improvements focus on finding the best, speediest route to a destination in real time. Not sure if you should bike, drive or take a train? Maps has a new schedule viewer that lines up all the options to help you decide. It will no longer be necessary to do a search for a start or end address -- you can click on the map and instantly see the driving routes. Car accidents will appear on the map in real time. Live updates on road conditions have been popular with drivers, as we've seen with Waze, a popular navigation app that crowd sources road information. Google will also add dynamic rerouting, automatically finding an alternate route that avoids traffic-slowing incidents. Graphic redesign . The redesigned Maps will let Google's sleek-looking maps and vast library of photos shine. Text takes a back seat in this version. Images from Google Street View, user-submitted photos and fun Google projects like underwater view and interior 3-D tours are all highlighted, while the map itself fills the page. The final, neatest new feature is also the least practical. Zoom all the way out on Google Maps and you'll see the Earth floating in space against a backdrop of stars. The cloud cover moving over the planet, as well as the position of the sun and stars, are all shown as they are in real time. Google Maps has clients that pay to use the maps data in their own products, like mobile apps and websites, often designing and creating their own unique offerings. The updates, along with other under-the-hood improvements, will be available to these more than 1 million products that use Google Maps data over the next few months.","Google Maps to roll out redesign with better navigation tools and a view from space .

"(CNN) -- When convicted intelligence leaker Bradley Manning asked Thursday for hormone treatment at a military prison so he can become Chelsea Manning, the response was immediate: No. So would the former Army private have a better shot at becoming a woman if he were transferred to a civilian prison, a move his lawyer has suggested he might attempt? Maybe. But he should get ready for a fight. Recently, federal courts in some states, including Virginia, Maryland and Massachusetts, have authorized hormone treatment for inmates at government expense, ruling that it's part of an inmate's right to adequate medical care guaranteed by the 8th Amendment. But no prisoner has undergone state-sponsored gender reassignment surgery, according to Dr. Ron Shansky, the former Illinois Department of Corrections medical director. He consults nationally on prison health-care issues, particularly concerning transgender inmates. He evaluated his first transgender inmate in 1989. ""These kind of requests are so rare -- few compared to the thousands in the system -- so corrections employees don't have a lot of experience or training,"" he said. ""And the prison system in this country has a history of being old-fashioned, puritanical,"" he said. A correctional staffer is more likely to think that a male inmate acting like a woman is doing that out of defiance or acting out. ""Only lately, I think, has there been some understanding that medical science says that this treatment is, in some cases, as critical as giving an inmate his heart medication or dialysis."" Robert wants to be Michelle . The only inmate close to getting a state-covered sex change is Michelle Kosilek. She was Robert Kosilek, a laborer who was convicted of murdering his wife in 1990 and given a life sentence without parole. Kosilek began asking for hormone therapy in 1992, arguing that he felt debilitating depression and wanted to kill himself. ""She couldn't look in the mirror,"" said his lawyer, Joseph Sulman. ""She felt trapped in her own body. She was not a man, despite having the genitals of a man."" Doctors diagnosed Kosilek with gender identity disorder, a condition listed in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, a book of classifications of mental disorders widely used by American mental health professionals. The newest edition, the DSM-5, now calls the condition gender dysphoria, but it's essentially the same symptoms: intense confusion and strain over one's gender. 5 things to know about gender identity . Kosilek was eventually given estrogen and other drugs, Sulman said, but when she asked for surgery, many Massachusetts officials fiercely opposed funding the operation, which the Boston Globe has reported could cost $50,000. In 2008, Republican state Sen. Scott Brown filed legislation to ban the use of taxpayer money to pay for the surgery. ""We have many big challenges facing us as a nation, but nowhere among those issues would I include providing sex change surgery to convicted murderers,"" Brown said, according to the Boston Globe. ""I look forward to common sense prevailing and the ruling being overturned."" More than 20 state lawmakers sent a letter to the state's prisons chief saying they did not support providing Kosilek a state-funded operation. The legislation failed. In September 2012, two decades after Kosilek first requested treatment, U.S. District Judge Mark Wolf ruled that the state must pay for the surgery, citing the 8th Amendment. Wolf made history. While other judges across the country had ordered corrections departments to provide drugs and psychotherapy to gender-confused inmates, he was the first to order that the state pay for surgery. The government is in the process of appealing the ruling, and Michelle Kosilek remains, anatomically, a man. ""Michelle understands that to get this far is a very big deal. It's precedent-setting,"" Sulman said. ""To go from not being able to look in the mirror to feeling trapped in her own body to knowing that there is chance to fully transition, I think her mental state has improved."" Read more about the Kosilek case . Michael wants to be De'lonta . A Virginia inmate is close to getting a similar ruling. In 2004, inmate Michael Stokes, serving 73 years for bank robbery, was able to reach a settlement with the state's corrections department that allowed her to receive hormones behind bars. Stokes was going by Ophelia De'lonta and, with permission from correctional officials, styling herself like a woman, wearing makeup and tweezing her eyebrows. According to a court document (PDF), she was seeing a prison therapist about her incessant urges to rid herself of the genitalia she was born with. She kept telling prison officials that she felt overwhelmed. Eventually, De'lonta couldn't take it anymore. She bought disposable razor blades at the prison commissary and tried to cut her penis off. After her hospitalization, she filed a federal lawsuit in 2011, claiming that the state failed to provide adequate medical care because it refused to give her a sex change operation. In January, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found that De'lonta can argue that denying her the surgery violates the 8th Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. As De'lonta's case makes its way through the courts, there could be more to come across the nation. In 2012, the Federal Bureau of Prisons updated its health care policy to include transgender inmates. Bureau spokesman Chris Burke said officials would not be giving interviews on the topic, but he forwarded its patient policy (PDF), which says an inmate has the right to an evaluation to determine whether treatment is necessary. A unstudied population . Correctional professionals know little about how many inmates like De'lonta or Kosilek are inside U.S. prisons. That could be a big problem, some experts say, because transgender people are more likely to wind up in the criminal justice system than others in the general population, and they are at higher risk for security problems behind bars. The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force and the National Center for Transgender Equality published a 2011 report based on a survey of 6,450 people who identified as transgender or gender-nonconforming. Sixteen percent said that they had been compelled to make a living illegally, such as prostitution or selling drugs, due to discrimination that led to bad work environments, loss of a job, poverty and other tough situations. Once in jail or prison, those people reported that they had been physically or sexually assaulted because of their gender issue. A 2007 University of California, Irvine study found that people who identify as transgender are 13 times more likely to be sexually assaulted in prison. There were 1.6 million inmates in state and federal prisons in 2011, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Yet only a few studies appear to have been done on identifying prisoners who are transgender. A 2009 study of California's men's prisons identified more than 330 transgender inmates -- people born as men but identifying as women -- out of a population of approximately 160,000. More than 80% of the inmates said they live as women before being prisoners, and nearly half had lived on the streets. These figures are partly why, in 2011, authorities in the Chicago area began housing transgender detainees based on the gender they identify with rather than the one they were born with, according to The New York Times. Transgender detainees at the Cook County Jail are allowed to meet with a panel of doctors and therapists to determine where they should be housed, and correctional employees are instructed to let transgender inmates wear clothing or use hygiene products that they feel suit their gender. Corrections employees are also trained in how to interact with transgender people. A similar program was implemented in Denver last year. When an arrested person is booked, they are evaluated to determine where they should be placed: a female or male housing unit, taking into consideration which gender the person lives as. ""It seemed like a no-brainer to us to have this both from a security standpoint and to make the people who come through the justice system feel like they are being treated equally,"" Denver Undersheriff Gary Wilson said. ""And it's saved us a lot of money,"" he explained. ""Before this, we had to have 23-hour lockdowns to protect someone vulnerable. This made more sense, and with training, it was fairly simple to get off the ground."" California law lets transgender students pick bathrooms . Former Navy SEAL comes out as transgender .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- In a congratulatory letter to president-elect Barack Obama, French President Nicholas Sarkozy writes, ""Your election raises in France, in Europe, and beyond throughout the world, immense hope."" President-elect Barack Obama faces a litany of foreign policy problems when he takes office January 20. Similar statements from dozens of world leaders and images of people around the world celebrating his election make clear Barack Obama will enjoy a good deal of international goodwill when he takes office on January 20. Obama's election offers a monumental transformation of America's face to the world. Many see him as the epitome of the American dream. But his appeal is not solely based on the fact that he is black or that his middle name is Hussein or that his father was Kenyan or that he spent part of his childhood in Indonesia. The global excitement over Obama's election is as much about the fact that he isn't President Bush. In his victory speech Tuesday night, Obama said, ""To all those watching from beyond our shores, our stories are singular, but our destiny is shared, and a new dawn of American leadership is at hand.''  Watch CNN's Zain Verjee report on the world's reaction to Obama's election » . Those were welcome words to those who resented what they viewed as eight years of ""unilateralist"" Bush policies. His words spark hope that an Obama administration will repair America's relations with the rest of the world. But as high as those hopes are, so too are the sky-high expectations. The world has been seduced by Obama's vision of change. But will ""Obamamania"" survive the realities of governing? It is difficult to think of a U.S. president who has come to power with a more complex and pressing web of domestic and international burdens. He inherits a global financial meltdown, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, a global struggle against terrorism, and a military already stretched to its limits. Add to that, a simmering crisis with Iran, renewed tensions with Russia, and the rise of China as a global economic powerhouse, and Obama's plate starts to get pretty full. Obama also takes the reins at a time of enormous anti-American sentiment after the stains of Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo and, closer to home, Hurricane Katrina. U.S. power is declining, and not entirely by fault of its own. The concept of a single-superpower world no longer fits. Developing countries like China, Brazil and India, coupled with a stronger European Union belong to a new world where many players call the shots. Globalization requires more cooperation with a wider range of countries and organizations. Obama's speech in Europe this summer about the need for reconciliation, signaled he wants to strengthen ties with Europe damaged during the Bush administration, especially over Iraq. His pledge to withdraw from Iraq and his promise for strong action on climate change is bound to make European allies happy. But issues like trade and increased troops for Afghanistan could spark new differences with Europe. Obama has pledged to make Middle East peace a priority from Day One. Arabs are already calling for a more even-handed approach, while Israel is expecting Obama to stay true to the pro-Israel posture he showed during the campaign. And there are other complications -- like politics on the ground. Israeli elections early next year could bring hawkish former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu back to power. And if moderate Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is unable to win support from Hamas next year to extend his term, his re-election is far from certain. Obama has promised to engage Iran's leaders on a multitude of issues, but it remains to be seen if Iran would accept any deal to give up its pursuit of nuclear weapons. Obama could be forced into a devil's choice between military action (or supporting an Israeli strike) and living with a nuclear Iran. There is a long list of other pressing issues. Obama is likely to continue the Bush administration's policy of going after extremists in Pakistan. And in Africa, conflicts in Sudan, Somalia and the Democratic Republic of Congo continue to churn. This is by no means an exhaustive list. Countries around the world will compete for Obama's attention.

"(Health.com) -- Study after study has linked long work hours, demanding bosses, and other on-the-job stressors to health problems ranging from insomnia to heart attacks. But the jobs themselves may not be entirely to blame. According to a new study of Swedish twins, the relationship between job stress and health problems is influenced in part by differences in personality and temperament, such as how optimistic, confident or self-critical a person is. And these traits are in turn closely related to genetic makeup. The researchers analyzed data from about 300 pairs of fraternal and (genetically) identical twins, many of whom did not grow up together. The various combinations of shared genes and upbringings allowed the researchers to parse the connections between genes and environment, job satisfaction and stress, and physical health. Health.com: Job killing you? 8 types of work-related stress . After crunching the numbers, they made two initial conclusions: personality type is associated with job stress and health, and a large portion of the differences in personality type -- nearly 45% -- can be attributed to genes. Taking the analysis one step further, the researchers estimate that genetic effects are responsible for 32% of the person-to-person variance in job stress, 35% of the variance in job satisfaction and 47% of the variance in health problems. The upshot? The path between job stress and poor health runs at least partly through our genes and personality. ""We're not saying job stress makes no difference, or there aren't things that cause stress,"" says lead author Timothy Judge, a professor of management at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana. ""But we can't have a concept ... that life would be better if we just changed jobs."" Health.com: 10 careers with high rates of depression . The findings, which were published in the journal Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, seem to suggest a new twist on the old nature-versus-nurture question: What's more important for stress, the day-to-day work environment (the ""nurture"" side, in this case) or the inborn personality of the employee? The question may not be so clear-cut, says Carol A. Prescott, a professor of psychology at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. In twin studies, Prescott says, it can be difficult to separate the shared environment -- whether that's a childhood home or the workplace -- from non-shared environmental factors, such as ""random events,"" luck, and personal choices. ""Non-shared environment is by far the largest component for most behavioral outcomes,"" Prescott says. Judge and his colleagues did try to distinguish between shared and non-shared factors. In addition to noting whether the twins grew up together, they also controlled for education and job characteristics (such as a hazardous workplace). Still, they acknowledge that ""idiosyncratic"" differences in non-shared environment are hard to pin down. Health.com: How your job can hurt your heart . Although much gray area remains, the new study raises the possibility that previous research on the link between job stress and health woes may be providing an incomplete picture. Epidemiological studies, which look for broad trends in large populations of people, often don't account for genes or temperament -- factors that can affect a person's experience of job stress, as well as how they describe it in questionnaires, Judge says. ""What if the very people who report they're really stressed are the very people who also report -- or actually have -- health problems?"" Judge says. ""We showed that a big part of the relationship between the two is genetic."" Health.com: Stressed? 7 steps to instant calm . Simon Rego, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, says it's important to remember that genes, though influential, don't control us. Someone who's genetically more vulnerable to workplace stress won't necessarily get stressed out. In fact, Rego says, stress often arises when our temperament and our environment clash. ""We look at the interaction between predisposition and some sort of stressor to really activate someone's vulnerability,"" he says. If you are predisposed to stress -- due to your genes, life experiences, or some combination of the two -- the good news is there are steps you can take to fight back. Talk therapy, for instance, can help people recognize the situations that cause them stress and learn coping strategies, Rego says. The vicious physiology of stress .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court has denied an appeal by Chevron to block an $18 billion judgment against it in an Ecuadorian court. The high court gave no explanation behind its decision not to consider the appeal from the oil giant. The case, Chevron Corp v. Naranjo et al, stems from a 2011 injunction against enforcement of any judgments against the company related to lawsuits in Ecuador. A judge initially granted the injunction, but in January of this year an appeals court reversed the lower court's finding, removing the injunction. What the Supreme Court announced on Tuesday was that it would not consider Chevron's appeal to reinstate the injunction. An Ecuadorian court had ruled that Chevron must pay $8.6 billion in damages relating to a pollution lawsuit, an amount that increased to $18 billion because Chevron did not apologize. In Ecuador, Chevron has appealed to the country's National Court, and in the United States it sought to reinstate the injunction against enforcement of the Ecuadorian ruling. Chevron noted the Supreme Court ruling was not based on the merits of the case, and does not undo findings by another court that ""fraud and bias have tainted the Ecuadorian proceedings and judgment."" ""While Chevron is disappointed that the court denied the petition, Chevron will continue to defend against the plaintiffs' lawyers' attempts to enforce the fraudulent Ecuadorian judgment,"" the company said on a blog it devotes to the case. Chevron's legal fight in Ecuador involves litigation that goes back 19 years between residents of Ecuador's Amazon region and Texaco, which was later purchased by Chevron. The pollution case stems from claims that the company had a detrimental impact on Amazonian communities where it operated. The company alleges that reports and evidence against it were fraudulent, and that bribes and corruption led to the original decision against it. That case, Aguinda v. ChevronTexaco, was originally filed in New York in 1993 on behalf of 30,000 inhabitants of Ecuador's Amazon region. The suit was eventually transferred to the Ecuadorian court and Ecuadorian jurisdiction. The lawsuit alleges that Texaco used a variety of substandard production practices in Ecuador that resulted in pollution that decimated several indigenous groups in the area, according to a fact sheet provided by the Amazon Defense Coalition. According to the group, Texaco dumped more than 18 billion gallons of toxic waste into Amazon waterways, abandoned more than 900 waste pits, burned millions of cubic meters of gases with no controls and spilled more than 17 million gallons of oil due to pipeline ruptures. Cancer and other health problems were reported at higher rates in the area, the group says. Chevron says Texaco was partnered with an Ecuadorian oil company when it operated in Ecuador, and that it spent $40 million on remediation efforts to clean up roughly one-third of the sites in which it worked -- an amount reflective of its 37% share of the oil-producing consortium with Petroecuador. It says its cleanup efforts were certified and approved by the Ecuadorian government and blames Petroecuador for any ongoing pollution at sites where it was the sole operator, according to documents on the Chevron website regarding the lawsuit and its history of operations in the South American country.","Chevron appealed to the Supreme Court to block an $18 billion judgment against it .

"(CNN) -- A graphic image of what was reported to be Osama bin Laden's bloodied face, which went viral on the Internet and was plastered on the front page of newspapers around the world, is a fake. The lower part of the photograph, which shows his partially opened mouth and graying beard, is almost identical to another image of bin Laden published years ago. The upper half shows his wounds in detail greater than that of the rest of the photo and there are unusual and abrupt shifts in the coloration of his skin. A photographer consulted by CNN said the gruesome photograph is most definitely not real. ""I have seen a great number of poorly Photoshopped images in my time as a photographer and I can tell by the pixels that it is a fake,"" said Kenna Lindsay, a New York-based photographer who works with composite images. The Guardian newspaper in Britain reported the picture is actually a combination of two photographs: a bloodied corpse and a real image of bin Laden that was taken in 1998 and used by the Reuters news agency. The doctored image blanketed the Internet in the hours after bin Laden's death and was picked up by news groups far and wide, in places like Pakistan, Afghanistan, Senegal and Iraq. Meanwhile, U.S. officials are weighing whether to release an actual image of bin Laden's corpse. A photograph could help to convince doubters about his death, but it also could inflame passions against the United States. ""I'll be candid that there are sensitivities here in terms of the appropriateness of releasing photographs of Osama bin Laden in the aftermath of this firefight,"" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters Tuesday. ""We're making an evaluation about the need to do that."" A senior government official involved in the discussions said a photo release could come as early as Tuesday. A second government official familiar with intelligence matters said deliberations are leaning toward a release, but emphasized that the decision ""isn't unanimous and everyone has understandable hesitation.""","A fake image of bin Laden's bloodied face went viral on the Internet .

"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- A drummer for the Swedish pop group ABBA has died after an apparent accident at his home in Spain, a Civil Guard spokeswoman said Monday. Ola Brunkert was found dead late Sunday at his home in the town of Arta on Spain's Mediterranean island of Mallorca, the spokeswoman said. Police believe Brunkert may have fallen against a glass partition separating his home's kitchen from the garden, and the glass broke and fatally cut his throat, she said. He was found in the garden and is believed to have bled to death, she added. An official cause of death is pending until after an autopsy. Brunkert, born in 1946 in Sweden, played drums on ABBA's first single, ""People Need Love,"" according to Abba's official Web site. He was not among the four best-known members of ABBA whose faces adorned the album covers -- Anni-Frid Lyngstad, Bjorn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson and Agnetha Faltskog -- but he was a key supporting musician for the group as it achieved stardom. The group's hits included ""Dancing Queen,"" ""Waterloo,"" ""Take a Chance on Me"" and ""Knowing Me, Knowing You."" ""Ola toured with ABBA in 1977, 1979 and 1980,"" the official Web site said.

"(CNN) -- Patients whose fungal tests are negative may still be at risk in a meningitis outbreak, as the fungus involved can be difficult to detect, federal health officials said Thursday. Cases of the non-contagious fungal meningitis rose to 170 in 11 states as of Thursday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Fourteen people have died. The cases have been linked to injections of contaminated steroid injection made by the Massachusetts-based New England Compounding Center. Meningitis outbreak: What is a compounding pharmacy? Some 14,000 people may have received the injections, the CDC said Thursday, an increase from its previous estimate of 13,000. Health officials have been able to contact more than 90% of the patients to warn them, officials said. But ""we aren't out of the woods yet,"" said Dr. J. Todd Weber, incident manager of the multistate outbreak for the CDC. While the investigation is ongoing, 50 vials of the injection have tested positive for fungus. Those vials were found in the NECC facility, as well as in clinics that received the medication. CDC's fungal disease laboratory has found the fungus Exserohilum in 10 meningitis patients, and the fungus Aspergillus in one patient. Exserohilum is new territory for health officials, as it's not typically seen, Weber told reporters Thursday. However, it can be difficult to find, meaning a patient whose fungal test is negative is not in the clear. Doctors are encouraged to be diligent in following up with patients, he said. Meningitis outbreak: Your questions answered . In addition, symptoms from Exserohilum can take a long time to develop. Patients who received the injections should remain vigilant for ""at least several months after injection,"" Weber said. The average period in which infections are seen is about two weeks, with the longest being 42 days, officials said. However, the longest period a patient may go before developing the disease is not known. Curing the infection requires a long course of treatment. The CDC is recommending two anti-fungal drugs, which are very strong and can be difficult for patients to tolerate, Weber said.","14 people have died from fungal meningitis linked to contaminated injections .

"(CNN) -- The videos and photographs are numbered in the dozens, every one of them telling a fragment of a terrible story: toddlers breathing their last gasp, the bodies of children laid out in rows and covered in blocks of ice, their faces pale and expressionless. Elsewhere, dozens of white shrouds appear to hold the corpses of adults, the names of the victims written hurriedly on the cloth. There was some sort of ghastly event in the suburbs of Damascus early on Wednesday: the sheer volume of material uploaded within a short time span and the consistent testimony of medical staff attest to that. But there are as many questions as answers. The victims showed no sign of injury; there was none of the bloodshed associated with artillery attacks, no wounded, dust-covered people being dug from buildings reduced to ruins. It was impossible to know how many had died and exactly where or why. By the end of the day, the Local Coordination Committees were reporting that more than 1,300 people had been killed in areas around Damascus, some 400 in the neighborhood of Zamalka alone. Even by the standards of Syria's remorseless conflict, that would represent a catastrophic day. But there was no way to verify such figures: mass burials began within hours, and of course, there was no access to the area for independent observers. Mistrust between U.S., Syrian rebels hinders military aid . Accusations fly . Opposition activists almost immediately alleged President Bashar al-Assad's regime had used chemical weapons against districts long controlled by rebel groups. It is not the first such allegation; some activists were soon claiming the regime had used sarin, a nerve agent that it is widely thought to possess. Residents spoke of dizziness and choking, convulsions and difficulty breathing, which would be consistent with the symptoms of sarin poisoning. But some victims appeared to have died in their sleep, undisturbed, according to local reports. The Syrian government dismissed the claims of chemical weapons being used as ""disillusioned and fabricated."" Some opposition activists say the toxin used may have been ""Agent 15,"" also known as BZ. Its full name is 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate, and it affects both the peripheral and central nervous systems. The opposition claimed that BZ was used in tank shells fired in the city of Homs last December. A doctor in the city told the online publication ""The Cable"" soon after that the victims ""all had miosis -- pinpoint pupils. They also had generalized muscle pain. There were also bad symptoms as far as their central nervous system. There were generalized seizures, and some patients had partial seizures."" Physicians for Human Rights, a non-governmental organization, says that BZ induces a ""severely altered mental status (hallucinations, giddiness, confusion); lack of secretions -- dry mucous membranes, dry mouth, eyes, skin; dilated pupils, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting."" But the reports from Homs, like so many of the allegations to emerge from Syria, were never confirmed. The next month, the U.S. State Department said it had ""found no credible evidence to corroborate or to confirm that chemical weapons were used"" in Homs. Some experts doubt the Assad regime possesses BZ. Perhaps more significant is an account from the spring of this year, when Jean-Philippe Remy from the French newspaper Le Monde spent weeks in and around Jobar, the opposition-held district on the edge of Damascus that saw many of the casualties early Wednesday. ""No odor, no smoke, not even a whistle to indicate the release of a toxic gas,"" he reported ""And then the symptoms appear. The men cough violently. Their eyes burn, their pupils shrink, their vision blurs. Soon they experience difficulty breathing, sometimes in the extreme; they begin to vomit or lose consciousness."" ""The people who arrive have trouble breathing,"" a doctor told Le Monde. ""They've lost their hearing, they cannot speak, their respiratory muscles have been inert. If we don't give them immediate emergency treatment, death ensues."" ""In Jobar, the fighters did not desert their positions, but those who stayed on the front lines -- with constricted pupils and wheezing breath,"" Remy reported. Syrian refugees stream into Iraq . Outsiders unsure of the cause . Independent experts who studied Wednesday's videos were unsure of the cause. Gwyn Winfield, editorial director at the magazine CBRNe World -- which reports on chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear or explosives use -- analyzed the videos and wrote on the magazine's site: ""Clearly respiratory distress, some nerve spasms and a half-hearted washdown (involving water and bare hands?), but it could equally be a riot control agent as a (chemical warfare agent)."" The allegations that some sort of chemical weapons were used came amid an ongoing government assault on rebel-held areas around Damascus - such as Douma and Mouadamiya - with artillery and air strikes further complicating the picture. The Syrian military's goal is to push the rebels back, thereby reducing mortar attacks on the heart of the capital. That offensive continued Wednesday, according to opposition activists in Jobar and Ghouta. Some analysts speculated that a stockpile of chemical agents may have been hit by shelling, whether controlled by the rebels or the regime. But that would not explain the number of neighborhoods -- some several miles apart -- where the same symptoms were reported among victims. U.N. chemical weapons inspectors in Damascus . There is also the question of motive and timing, if regime forces were responsible. Just a few miles from those terrible scenes, a team of United Nations chemical weapons inspectors -- led by a well-qualified Swede -- were asleep at their hotel. Russia -- an ally of the Assad regime -- made that point immediately. A Foreign Ministry statement from Moscow noted that ""the criminal act was committed near Damascus at the very moment when a mission of U.N. experts had successfully started their work of investigating allegations of the possible use of chemical weapons there."" But the terms of the inspectors' visit are tightly prescribed; they are only permitted to visit three sites where chemical weapons are alleged to have been used in the past. Government forces did not appear to be in imminent danger of being overrun by rebel factions in the areas concerned; in fact, many observers believe a bloody stalemate has set in around Damascus. And regime forces have also made gains recently against rebels around Homs and elsewhere. Why would it risk an action that would likely kill hundreds in a heavily-populated area and risk stirring up an international appetite for intervention? Would it also have risked using an agent as lethal as sarin just a few kilometers from the heart of Damascus -- to both the southwest and northeast of the city -- on what appears to have been a quite windy night? The European Union believes the Syrian government was the most likely culprit. ""We have seen with grave concern the reports of the possible use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime, said the EU's Foreign Policy chief, Catherine Ashton.""Such accusations should be immediately and thoroughly investigated."" The White House made a very similar statement. In a familiar ritual, Russia quickly pointed the finger at rebel forces, alleging that ""a homemade rocket, analogous to that which was used by terrorists on the 19th of March in Khan al-Asal, containing a so-far-undefined poisonous substance, was launched from positions held by the fighters"" early on Wednesday morning. The incident in Khan al-Asal, near Aleppo, was reported to have left 19 people dead. Some observers also point to claims on jihadist websites that rebels have seized chemical weapons equipment after overrunning government bases such as one outside Aleppo in July 2012. Supporters of the Assad government claim that Wednesday's reports are very convenient for the opposition as it tries to spur the international community to action just as events in Egypt have claimed the front pages. Little hope for change . George Sabra, president of the Syrian National Council, an umbrella group of Assad opponents, said in Istanbul: ""It's not the first time in which the regime used chemical weapons ... but it presents a move by the regime, because they are doing it with impunity....The United Nations will be puzzled, and the U.S. will announce more red lines, and will leave it in the air."" Given the stated positions of the great powers, an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council seems unlikely to prompt decisive international action. Perhaps the world will never know whether the events of August 21, 2013, around Damascus amounted to the most widespread use of chemical agents since Saddam Hussein's bombardment of the Kurdish town of Halabja 25 years before. CNN's Yousuf Basil contributed to this report.","Videos of suffering and dying Syrians suggest a chemical attack, but verification is difficult .

"(CNN) -- Mumbai is extreme India. In this booming metropolis all the wealth, inequalities, colors, flavors and passions of India are magnified to an almost unbearable degree. For many Indians, Mumbai is the place where dreams can come true. Somewhere between 13 and 20 million people are squeezed into the city that is India's leading financial and industrial center and the home of the Bollywood movie. For countless migrants from all over the country, be they business school graduates, aspiring actors or destitute laborers, Mumbai is the place where dreams can come true. Those who like to think of India as a land of tradition and mystery would be shocked by the way modern Mumbai has embraced western consumerism. In Mumbai the rigidities of India's traditional caste system are being replaced by a kind of brutal meritocracy in which the winners become extraordinarily rich and the losers struggle for survival. While Mumbai is fearlessly embracing modernity, minting millionaires and erecting skyscrapers, its infrastructure is hopelessly outdated and creaking under the weight of the city's ever-expanding population. Mumbai's road traffic is legendary -- a chaotic melange of cars, mopeds, motorized rickshaws and red double-decker buses, seemingly fused together in a writhing, gridlocked mass. All big cities have deprived areas, but in Mumbai the deprivation is impossible to avoid. Up to half of Mumbai's residents live in slums, about a million in the shacks of Dharavi, the biggest slum in Asia. In these cities within a city children play next to the sewers that run through the streets, whole families often live in a single room and clean water is scarce. Yet while the slums can be grindingly poor, they are also buzzing with activity. Many residents of Dharavi work in cottage industries and in the thriving recycling trade, and their biggest threats are the annual monsoon floods and the developers eager to clear the slum in order to exploit the prime real estate it occupies. For outsiders, the contrast between rich and poor can be jarring, but Mumbaikars have learned to live with adversity. While the Mumbai terror attacks of November 2008 horrified the world, the killings were tragically familiar to those living in a city where hundreds have been killed by terrorists over the last 15 years and religious and social tensions simmer beneath the surface. Yet, despite its very visible problems, Mumbai simply will not be denied. Constantly growing in population and wealth, Mumbai is a world-class city when it comes to culture, commerce and consumption. Mumbaikars are incredibly enterprising and their ability to bounce back from tragedy is testimony to their resourcefulness and resilience. Danny Boyle, director of award-winning movie ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" set and filmed in Mumbai, said of the city, ""Despite all that has happened there recently it is a city moving towards happiness. ""You have these incredible extremes but it feels like there's a destiny that binds it all together.""","Mumbai is fearlessly embracing modernity and western consumerism .

"(CNN) -- With fans still reeling from last Sunday's Red Wedding episode, ""The Rains of Castamere,"" the third season of ""Game of Thrones"" comes to a close this weekend, and no one is waiting with more bated breath for that than Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who plays Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer on the HBO program. ""Even though I've read all the scripts, I wasn't around when they shot all of it,"" he reminded CNN. ""So one of the things that's great about this show is that I can actually watch it and enjoy it, despite knowing what's going to happen."" Coster-Waldau, who recently appeared in the Tom Cruise film ""Oblivion"" and is shooting ""The Other Woman,"" a romantic comedy with Cameron Diaz and Leslie Mann, finds the most interesting aspect of watching ""Game of Thrones"" is being able to reassess the constantly shifting scales of morality in a world where no one character is completely a hero or a villain (save for perhaps Joffrey?). Daenerys Targaryen, for instance, might be the Mother of Dragons and liberating slaves, ""but she's burning down cities! She's killing all these other people!"" he laughed. ""I'm sure a lot of those guards are just guys with families."" The Starks and their men, he pointed out, committed their own share of atrocities, even if they were portrayed as a more honorable family than the Lannisters. ""One of my favorite scenes with Brienne (played by Gwendoline Christie) was last season, when we come across three girls hanging,"" Coster-Waldau recalled. ""Brienne kills the Stark guards, because they had just raped these women for no reason, because they thought it was within their rights."" If Ned Stark's beheading in season one and the Red Wedding in season three taught us anything, Coster-Waldau said, it should be to look at the chain of consequences of each character's actions. For instance, Catelyn didn't fully investigate a claim of attempted murder and arrested the wrong man, starting a war. And Robb broke a treaty of arranged marriage that was meant to broker an ally. ""In our world, for our morals, he did the right thing -- he married for love,"" Coster-Waldau said. ""But it was a selfish thing to do, because when he did that, they lost the support of part of the army and prolonged the war and thousands more were killed."" The Red Wedding, as brutal as it was to see certain characters get slaughtered, had an unseen consequence: ""It stopped the war. The war is over. A lot more people were saved."" Of course, a Lannister would be in support of the Red Wedding -- the Lannisters had a little something to do with it, hence Roose Bolton's statement before killing someone, ""The Lannisters send their regards."" Still, Coster-Waldau finds it interesting to gauge fan response and see which actions on the show provoke the more extreme reactions. He was surprised to see more people were disgusted in season one that Jaime Lannister ""was having sex with his own sister than that he pushed a kid out a window."" ""I thought, 'Well, he's in love with her, and I wouldn't want that in my own life, but they're two consenting adults,'"" he said. ""I would think you'd be more upset about him trying to kill a kid."" In a subsequent episode, fans were in an uproar about Ned Stark killing a direwolf (Sansa's direwolf Lady was punished in place of Arya's Nymeria, since she had been forced to run off after attacking Joffrey). ""In the scene right before that, you saw (Joffrey's guard) the Hound riding in with the butcher's boy (Micah) on his horse. He had just killed this little innocent kid, and no one was upset at that,"" Coster-Waldau said. ""But then this mystical creature was killed, and that was crossing a line. That was shocking for people: 'How could they kill an innocent animal?'"" (Were fans more upset that Robb's direwolf Grey Wind was killed in his kennel than his men at their table?) At this point in the show, the perception of Coster-Waldau's own character -- formerly considered a villain -- is shifting to the point where fans are rooting for him. Since losing his hand, Jaime Lannister has also become more sympathetic, ""because it's such an obstacle and forces such a change in him."" His speech to Brienne, about how he killed the Mad King to save the city, also changes the meaning of his moniker, the Kingslayer, which had been used as a pejorative. ""I think he sees that as his finest moment,"" Coster-Waldau said. ""He did break his vow to protect the king, but there was no way he could not break it. He had to. And he's had to live with that choice ever since."" As Brienne and Jaime make their way to King's Landing in the finale, the Lannisters are in a state of flux. Does Jaime even still love Cersei, who he dedicated his life to, now that he's developed a new relationship based on mutual respect? ""His relationship with Cersei is not a very healthy relationship, because it's all on her terms,"" Coster-Waldau noted. ""And for the first time in his life, he's been together with another adult who is so unlike the world of King's Landing, who says what she means, who does what she says, who walks the walk. He sees something in Brienne that he might have feared or lost in himself."" A sense of honor, perhaps. A sense of dedication. ""Losing his hand, he's been forced to reconsider everything."" But don't expect that relationship to be resolved in the final hour of this season, because as any good season finale will do, Coster-Waldau said, ""it will provide closure, and it will set up next year. But it will make for a tricky homecoming, that's for sure!""","After last week's shocking episode of ""Game of Thrones,"" stakes are high for Sunday finale .
The Kingslayer, played by Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, says there are no clear-cut heroes or villains .
The finale will provide closure, as well as raise new questions."
"(CNN) -- The U.S. relationship with President Hosni Mubarak's Egypt is full of contradictions and tensions, according to recently published U.S. diplomatic cables, but is also underpinned by similar basic interests in a rough and unpredictable part of the world. A CNN analysis of secret and confidential cables published by WikiLeaks and its media partners reveals U.S. frustration with Mubarak's lack of succession planning, concerns over stuttering economic reform and private criticism of the Mubarak government's hard line toward domestic opponents. But the cables also show that Washington sees Egypt as an important and -- until now -- stable ally on issues, including Iran's nuclear program, promoting negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority and making life difficult for Hamas in Gaza. And above all, Egypt is regarded as a moderate bulwark against Iranian-sponsored Islamist fundamentalism. The cables show that Mubarak has taken a persistently hard line toward Iran, telling U.S. diplomats in 2008 that he had warned Tehran ""not to provoke the Americans"" on the nuclear issue and insisting Egypt could never accept a nuclear-armed Iran. Mubarak has also repeatedly warned of Iran's influence with Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, and in a cable from February last year, was quoted as describing ""Tehran's hand moving with ease throughout the region, from the Gulf to Morocco."" A 2009 cable noted that with ""the discovery of a Hezbollah cell in Egypt, the Egyptians appear more willing to confront the Iranian surrogates and to work closely with Israel."" To that end, the cables describe the Mubarak government as a helpful partner in stopping smuggling into Gaza from Egypt. A cable from 2008 quoted a senior Egyptian military figure as stating that Egypt had spent approximately $40 million to purchase the steel for an underground wall on the Gaza border, ""and Egypt was paying the cost of this wall in terms of public opinion both within Egypt and the region."" There is no guarantee that any ""successor"" to the Mubarak government would take such a hard line with Hamas. For the U.S., the alliance between Egypt and Saudi Arabia has also been an important counterweight to growing Iranian influence on the ""Arab street"" and among states such as Syria and Qatar. Egyptian officials, from Mubarak down, have also repeatedly impressed upon visiting Americans -- military, diplomatic and Congressional -- that it alone among Arab states can play a mediating role between Israel and the Palestinians. [Egypt signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979, and Mubarak has resisted popular opposition to it.] . Ahead of Mubarak's visit to Washington in May 2009, Ambassador Margaret Scobey wrote from Cairo that ""the Egyptians want the visit to demonstrate that Egypt remains America's indispensable ""Arab ally."" Scobey continued that Mubarak was ""a tried and true realist, innately cautious and conservative, and has little time for idealistic goals."" He viewed himself as ""someone who is tough but fair, who ensures the basic needs of his people."" At the same time, the Mubarak government has been very sensitive to any perceived slight from Washington. It has complained about cuts in U.S. economic aid and a stagnant level of military aid ""because it shows our diminished view of the value of our relationship"" according to one cable. On pressure to improve human rights, according to one cable from Scobey in 2009, ""Mubarak takes this issue personally, and it makes him seethe when we raise it, particularly in public."" In a later cable, she said that Mubarak ""harkens back to the Shah of Iran: the U.S. encouraged him to accept reforms, only to watch the country fall into the hands of revolutionary religious extremists."" The Egyptian president relied on his interior minister and intelligence service to ""keep the domestic beasts at bay, and Mubarak is not one to lose sleep over their tactics."" The U.S. cables display frustration with Mubarak's reluctance to address human rights issues, with one in 2008 saying: ""While Egypt has made some limited gains over the last several years, such as on freedom of the press, progress overall has been slow."" In a later cable, Scobey suggested the new U.S. Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton ""may wish to lay down a marker for a future discussion on democratization and human rights concerns."" But given Mubarak's sensitivities, the U.S. has trodden carefully in pressing the Egyptian government on human rights. A cable from 2009 said the United States now avoided ""the public confrontations that had become routine over the past several years"" over human rights. Over the past five years, the cables reveal a growing unease with the lack of a succession plan, and apprehension about the prospect of Mubarak's younger son, Gamal, taking over from his father. As far back as April 2006, one cable observed that Mubarak's wife, Suzanne, was their son's ""most ardent booster"" but added: ""The possibility that Gamal might succeed his father remains deeply unpopular on the street."" It adds that ""unlike his father, (Gamal) cannot take the military's support for granted,"" having never served as an officer. But the same cable laments the lack of obvious contenders to succeed the aging Mubarak -- a situation that appears to hold today. Scobey wrote in apparent frustration two years ago that Mubarak ""seems to be trusting to God and the ubiquitous military and civilian security services to ensure an orderly transition."" Recent events may have eroded that confidence, but one cable in 2007 pointed out that Egypt's internal security apparatus, ""an estimated 1.4 million strong, is at least twice the size it was under Sadat ... and makes any kind of violent change of leader unlikely."" That perspective is now being challenged -- and the role of the military may be critical in deciding the outcome. A cable from 2008 cites Egyptian experts as describing a ""disgruntled mid-level officer corps"" with military salaries falling far behind the civilian sector and the top brass averse to Gamal succeeding his father. Egyptian commentators also noted that many officers were frustrated that loyalty to the regime trumped competence, and that the best military talent was sidelined in case it should pose a threat to the government. Even so, one cable concludes: ""The military still remains a potent political and economic force."" After discussing whether the military might step in to prevent Mubarak from passing the baton to his son, the cable concludes: ""In a messier succession scenario, however, it becomes more difficult to predict the military's actions.""","A CNN analysis of secret cables published by WikiLeaks reveals U.S. frustration .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- The official limousine awaiting President Barack Obama's arrival in Israel malfunctioned after its driver refueled it using gasoline rather than diesel fuel, an official said Wednesday. The limo failed to start, and required towing in Jerusalem at 10 a.m. local time. Obama, who landed in Tel Aviv around noon, was not in the country at the time the limo was towed. A second presidential limo was brought to transport Obama. ""We experienced mechanical trouble with one of the cars,"" Edwin Donovan, a spokesman for the Secret Service, told a pool reporter traveling with Obama. ""We don't know the cause."" Donovan couldn't confirm reports the limo was refueled using gasoline rather than diesel. ""That's why we bring different multiple vehicles,"" Donovan said. The tow truck company owner who picked up the limo said the U.S. consulate called him to tow the vehicle in Jerusalem because it wouldn't start. Multiple official vehicles are typically flown ahead of time to destinations where Obama is visiting. On his trip to the Mideast, Obama will stop in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem in Israel, Ramallah in the West Bank, and will visit with Jordan's King Abdullah in that nation. The presidential limousine, known as the ""Beast,"" is a specially built Cadillac that's estimated to weigh 8 tons. There are multiple, identical copies that are used to transport Obama around Washington and on his trips out of town. The Secret Service is tight-lipped about the specifics of the vehicle, but the car reportedly features inches of armor and bulletproof glass, doors and windows that seal shut in the event of a gas attack, and special shocks to absorb blasts. It's said to be built on a medium-grade truck chassis, the Chevrolet Kodiak, which runs on diesel fuel. Diesel engines differ from gas engines in the way the internal combustions are created to drive the pistons. Diesel engines utilize compressed air to generate heat that causes the fuel to ignite. Gas engines ignite fuel using spark plugs. Using gas instead of diesel could cause major damage to the pistons, wrist pins and connecting rods, which would be destroyed if the fuel is ignited at the wrong time. Gasoline is also less viscous than diesel, which acts as a lubricant for the fuel pump and fuel delivery systems. Those parts could also be destroyed if gasoline is pumped into a diesel engine. CNN's Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.","Barack Obama's official limousine in Israel failed to start .

"Brunswick, Georgia (CNN) -- Two teenage boys accused of shooting a baby in Brunswick, Georgia, made their first appearance in court on Monday, but they offered nothing in the way of explaining the strange and tragic case. A 15-year-old, who is not being identified because of his age, and 17-year-old De'Marquise Elkins were charged with murder last week. Wearing an orange jumpsuit, his hands and feet shackled, the 15-year-old listened as Glynn County Judge Timothy Barton read his Miranda rights. Previously, the boy's age was reported as 14. Authorities have not yet said whether the teen will be considered as a juvenile or adult, and the teen did not enter a plea. Asked if he had any questions, the teen told the judge, ""no sir."" Earlier, his mother, Brenda Moses, said her son was ""just a witness,"" and that ""he didn't do anything wrong."" ""My feelings go out to the mother, and the baby and my baby,"" Moses said. ""They've handled this investigation wrong, and the truth is going to come out."" Baby shot dead in stroller; 2 Georgia teens charged . Elkins, the second teenager accused in the killing, also did not enter a plea when he appeared in court Monday. He was dressed in regular clothes, but his hands and feet were handcuffed and he wore a belt shackle. Elkins' attorney, Jonathan Lockwood, spoke for him during the appearance. When he arrived in the courtroom, the teen turned to his mother, Karimah Elkins, and nodded. At the end of the appearance, she said, ""I love you, Marquise."" ""I'll never hear his first word' The slain infant's mother, Sherry West, said she was on her way home from the post office last week, pushing her son in a stroller when two males approached. One of them yelled at her to give him money. She said she didn't have any. He then proceeded to pull out a gun and shot at the ground. But because West didn't see any shells, she thought the gun was fake. ""I thought he was just using a toy gun to scare me. And then he shot at my head, and the bullet grazed my ear and the side of my head, and then he shot me in the leg, and I still thought that it was a fake gun,"" she told CNN's ""Piers Morgan Live."" ""He kept asking me (for money), and I kept telling him I don't have any,"" she said. ""He shot my baby in the face, and then I knew it was a real gun."" West, 42, said she started screaming. She took her son out of his harness and started CPR. She saw his lungs inflate but couldn't get a pulse, West said. Police and medical personnel took over when they arrived, West said, but it was too late. Her son died. ""I'll never hear his first word,"" West said. Baby's death marks 2nd time Georgia mom loses a son to violence . 'A life for a life' As of Monday, authorities had still not found the murder weapon. But they were able to track down the two suspects and take them into custody, aided by a description from West and others, as well as a check of school attendance records to determine who was not in class Thursday, the day of the shooting. West said she has no doubt that authorities have her baby's killer in custody: ""It's definitely him."" ""I just hope, you know, that the shooter dies. I mean, I had to watch my baby die and I want him to die. A life for a life,"" she said. Immediately after the shooting, detectives searched her home for a gun and conducted gun residue tests on both her and the baby's father, West said, adding that the tests were negative and the search did not turn up a gun. Citing the ongoing investigation, police spokesman Todd Rhodes declined to comment when asked about the search and those tests. West also said she relinquished a jacket she was wearing at the time of the shooting to a detective. She told police she was grabbed or shoved briefly by the suspected shooter, and they hope to lift a fingerprint off the jacket, she said. This isn't the first time West has lost a son to violence. Her 18-year-old son was stabbed to death in 2008 in New Jersey, she said. ""This is the second child that people have taken from me in a tragic way,"" West said. ""I'm so afraid to have any more babies now. I tried to raise really good kids in a wicked world."" 911 calls reveal witnesses' horror . Police in the coastal city of Brunswick released to CNN three recordings of 911 calls about Thursday's shooting. ""A baby has been shot!"" one woman said in a 911 call. The exchange with the emergency operator was emotionally charged. ""Listen to me, ma'am! Is the baby breathing?"" the operator replied. ""I don't know,"" the woman said. She began to cry. ""Listen to me!"" the operator said to the weeping woman. ""We have people en route. Did you hear shots in the area?"" Yes, she heard shots, she said. ""Be calm,"" the operator said. ""How many shots did you hear?"" ""I heard like three shots. And the baby has been shot in the head,"" the woman said. The woman was so distraught that she passed her cell phone to a man walking his dog. ""No, the baby is not breathing,"" the man told the operator. ""The baby was shot in the head?"" the operator continued. ""Yes, right between the eyes,"" the man said, adding that he earlier heard a ""small-caliber clap."" As he spoke, sirens wailed as police arrived on the scene, and the man broke off the phone call. Nick Valencia reported from Brunswick, Georgia. Dana Ford and Ashley Fantz reported and wrote from Atlanta.

"(CNN) -- A team of U.N. chemical weapons inspectors are in Syria where they will begin an investigation Monday into whether chemical weapons have been used during the bloody civil war there. The team won't be speaking to reporters during the visit, it said in a written statement, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's office said. Syria has been embroiled in a war for more than two years, during which more than 100,000 people have been killed and millions have been displaced or become refugees in other countries, according to the United Nations. Amid the fighting, there have been numerous allegations that chemical weapons have been used. Syria strikes refugee camp in northern Lebanon . In June, the White House said Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces had crossed a ""red line"" by using chemical weapons, including the nerve agent sarin gas, against rebel forces. This prompted the U.S. government to begin providing military support to opposition fighters, despite its earlier reluctance to do so. Bashar al-Assad is all smiles on his new Instagram account . Syria's government, meanwhile, has claimed rebel fighters have used chemical weapons as well. That includes a March incident in Khan al-Asal in the northern province of Aleppo, according to state media. Opposition officials have said rebels don't have access to chemical weapons or the missiles needed to use them in an attack, while other rebel leaders said Syrian troops fired ""chemical rockets"" at civilians and opposition forces. Chemical weapons frightful, relatively inexpensive .

"(CNN) -- As many as 20,000 Syrian refugees have flooded Jordan in just the last few days, the nation's foreign minister and refugee officials said Wednesday, straining resources amid warnings from international aid organizations to prepare for a prolonged humanitarian crisis. A day before, two children died in the Zaatari refugee camp, the largest in Jordan. The deaths sparked a small protest among refugees, whose patience has been tested in recent weeks by heavy rains, flooding and extreme cold in the desert camp about 15 kilometers (9.3 miles) from the Syrian border. Read more: Envoy: 2013 could bring 100,000 deaths in Syria . The refugees are fleeing the ongoing violence in Syria, where the United Nations estimates at least 60,000 people have died in 22 months of fighting between government forces and rebels seeking to depose President Bashar al-Assad. As many as 20,000 refugees have arrived in Jordan in just the last three days, the state-run Petra news agency said. Read more: Crisis in Syria: The Refugees . Jordanian Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh described the numbers -- 350,000 Syrian refugees since the conflict began -- as ""staggering."" ""This is obviously a reflection of the level of violence in southern Syria, and there will probably be more in the next few days,"" he said. ""We are getting aid -- we are getting aid from Arab countries, from Western countries, from international organizations. It is still not enough, given the numbers that are coming in."" Last week, the International Rescue Committee warned of a ""protracted humanitarian emergency"" in Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Iraq, which have absorbed about 600,000 Syrian refugees since the conflict began. Read more: Syrian children struggle in refugee camps as winter tightens its grip . While caring for refugees living in camps is an enormous task on its own, the group noted that in Jordan and other countries, a majority of Syrian refugees are living outside of camps -- in cities and towns where social services, schools and even trash and waste systems are ill-equipped to meet the needs of a suddenly inflated population. In Jordan, about 80% of refugees are trying to make their way in cities and towns, Judeh and the International Rescue Committee said. Read more: Syria's 'urban refugees' struggle for survival . In many places, the IRC said, the influx of refugees has pushed up rents while pushing down the going rate for day labor and other jobs available to refugees. Education for children is also an issue, the agency said. ""Even if the conflict comes to a swift end, Syria will emerge in ruins -- its social and civic fabric in shreds, its economy and infrastructure devastated and its population scattered throughout the country and region, potentially unable for months if not years to return to their shattered communities and resume normal life,"" the ICR warned in its report on Syrian refugees last week. The group called for a ""massive increase in humanitarian assistance"" to avoid a catastrophe. U.N. Emergency Relief Coordinator Valerie Amos also called on donors to help, saying she hoped a January 30 conference in Kuwait would yield some of the $1.5 billion in aid requested by humanitarian groups. That money would help Syrians displaced within their own country and those who have fled to neighboring nations for six months, she said. ""If we do not receive these funds, we will not be able to reach the poorest and most vulnerable families who so desperately need our help,"" she said. Read more: Syrian refugees in Turkey: Police are forcing us from homes . ""Donors need to step up, recognize the severity of the humanitarian crisis in and around Syria and face the virtual inevitability that this is going to get much worse and last much longer than initially anticipated,"" John Holmes, the co-chairman of the IRC's UK board of directors, said last week. In Zaatari, in Jordan's northern desert, about 60,000 people have sought refuge from the violence raging in their country. Nearly 3,000 people arrived Wednesday, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said. That brings the total number of refugees arriving in Jordan so far this month to 26,500 -- up 60% from December. And there's still another week's worth of refugees to come, said Aoife McDonnell, a Jordan-based spokeswoman for the UNHCR. Many of the refugees had to abandon their belongings on the trip across the border, in some cases to be able to carry their children through muddy, freezing conditions. ""They're often arriving freezing, their clothes are wet,"" she said. Enterprising Syrian refugees, many of whom arrived with nothing, have set up their own retail avenue amid dusty tents and prefabricated metal shelters, providing a small source of income and -- perhaps more importantly -- something to do to stave off the boredom and discomfort of camp life. Refugees are selling everything from food to clothing and household items donated by Jordanians, she said. Read more: Syrian refugees on run: 'I want people to feel our pain' Many are living in tents, but Arab nations recently donated 3,000 prefabricated metal shelters called caravans for use by residents. The camp has nine health facilities with 42 doctors treating everything from internal ailments to eye disorders, McDonnell said. And on average, five babies are born each day there, she said. Still, the camp has been the focus of what the International Rescue Committee called ""unending criticism from its occupants."" Refugees have endured harsh cold and flooding that not only made life miserable by swamping tents, but also made it difficult to deliver water and supplies, UNICEF said. McDonnell acknowledged that tensions have sometimes run high in the camp, especially during bad weather. But she said most families are just glad to be out of Syria. ""By the time the refugees arrive to Jordan, I think they're extremely grateful for the safety,"" she said. 146 killed in fighting in Syria; Patriot system started in Turkey . Back in Syria, the opposition group Local Coordination Committees reported that 146 people, including 15 children, were killed Wednesday in fighting.

"(CNN) -- Jeff Romig kept putting it off. He knew the doctor would give him bad news. He'd known it for years; he needed to lose weight. But as he sat in the doctor's office a few weeks ago and listened to his numbers -- cholesterol and blood pressure, both too high -- he resolved to change. This time, he decided to do something different, something drastic. After 10 years of talking about losing weight without much success, Romig decided to put his health and family first by leaving his high-pressure politics job. ""I knew I was doing the right thing, but I felt terrible,"" said Romig, 34, who lives in Georgia. While the tactic might be unusual, Romig is hardly alone in his struggle with weight gain or his reluctance to try to lose it. More than 30% of men older than 20 are overweight, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Men face the issue at the same rate as women, but until recently, ads for weight loss products mostly featured female faces and voices. According to ad industry watchers, the female-centric advertising had the inadvertent effect of scaring men away. Enter a slew of new ads from the biggest names in dieting: Weight Watchers, Nutrisystem and Jenny Craig. Weight Watchers took a direct approach, with television spots that explicitly tell men it's OK to diet. One commercial proclaims ""Weight Watchers online is for men, too,"" and, as a nod to the brand's more feminine advertising of yore: ""It's not all rainbows and lollipops."" ""Women really appreciate the fact that we are recognizing it as a widespread societal problem,"" said David Burwick, president of Weight Watchers North America. Beyond the multimillion-dollar campaign lies the hope for company expansion. Burwick estimated that only one-quarter of men who have weight problems actively seek to lose weight. That means plenty aren't spending money on weight loss products and programs, at least not yet. Aside from the attention paid by Madison Avenue, some men said they're learning they need more than just a plan; they need people to hold them accountable and to relate to their struggles. Lloyd Dinwiddie, an entertainment correspondent who goes by the name Gyant, said men don't often talk about their diets with other men, something he said he wishes would change. Though his nickname comes from his 6-foot-8-inch frame, Dinwiddie said not everyone appreciates his desire to slim down, and after years of diets, he's trying new techniques. ""Women look at me like I'm crazy. They say, 'You're just big, Gyant,'"" he said. ""At 310 pounds, every book in the world is telling me I need to lose weight."" Revealing journey as woman reduces weight by half . Dinwiddie said he applauds Weight Watchers and other companies that focus on men's health, but an ""average Joe""-style spokesman would work better than a Charles Barkley or Mariah Carey, who have trainers and chefs to keep them focused. Dinwiddie's current dieting effort includes a lot more chicken salads and outdoor activities, with a goal of losing 80 pounds. He has turned to an online community, hoping the discussion will serve as communal motivation. ""It's actually been a collective support system in a roundabout way 'cause in six months, if I'm not following it, they are going to be like, 'Yo, what's going on?'"" Romig, the man who quit his politics job, said he started using Weight Watchers in 2003, after his weight grew to 225 pounds. He lost 30 pounds then, but the positive momentum slowed after a big move and a new, stressful job. Through a few more jobs and one more move, Romig kept his Weight Watchers account, although he wasn't using it much. ""Every month, there goes that $16.95,"" he joked. CNN anchor: Dangers of labels and my bulimia . Work and volunteer commitments soaked up his time. To make decisions about lifestyle changes, he sat with his wife of nine years and ran through scenarios, including how to handle fatigue and soreness during weight loss, and questions about whether he could keep up the momentum. It all added up to one thing: Making time to get healthy, even if it meant reducing his work hours and relying more heavily on the income of his wife, an attorney. Social media has already proven to be helpful on the journey, he said. When he shared news of his resignation and intention to run in a 5K on Facebook, he got all positive comments, he said. Romig keeps himself honest with his phone and other technology that allows him to keep tabs on his progress; his goal is to go from 241 to 180 pounds. But those hyper-masculine ads? Romig said they didn't have much effect on him. The real motivation came from his wife, who told him, ""I worry that you're not going to be here."" Since last week, Romig has lost 9 pounds. He said everything else, even his job, is now secondary.","Weight Watchers, Nutrisystem, featuring men in ad campaigns .

"(CNN) -- Is the future of computers a hybrid gadget that will combine the battery life and computing heft of a laptop with the portability and ease-of-use of a tablet? Some in the industry are leaning toward ""yes."" But Apple CEO Tim Cook pointedly says ""no."" ""Anything can be forced to converge, but the problem is that products are about tradeoffs, and you begin to make tradeoffs to the point where what you have left at the end of the day doesn't please anyone,"" Cook said Tuesday in response to a question during Apple's quarterly earnings report. ""You can converge a toaster and refrigerator, but those things are probably not going to be pleasing to the user."" Cook's comments were at least in part a not-so-veiled jab at Microsoft, which, with its upcoming Windows 8 operating system, will be combining its PC and tablet operating systems. The system is available in a beta format now and is expected to be released as a finished product this fall. A Microsoft spokesperson declined to comment for this article. But on Twitter, lead Microsoft spokesman Frank Shaw made his own playful, appliance-oriented swipe. ""Must be a typo. It's not a toaster/fridge. It's a toaster/oven,"" Shaw wrote Tuesday. ""Those seem pretty popular. Just saying."" A late entrant, Windows has recently seen some relative success in the smartphone market, most notably with the Nokia Lumia phones, which have sold more than 2 million units since they started rolling out in October. Windows 8 is considered the computing giant's most serious push to become a player in the tablet market as well. The system is a ground-up overhaul of its industry-leading operating system that has garnered positive reviews since it was released in beta form about a month and a half ago. Currently, there's no new product announced that would qualify as a Windows 8-powered, tablet-PC hybrid. But it's definitely on folks' minds. Intel has shown off a prototype of a computer that flips from ""consumption mode"" (i.e. a tablet) to ""work mode"" (a laptop similar to the emerging line of sleek Ultrabooks). Apple, of course, has dominated the tablet market since unveiling the iPad in 2010. On Tuesday, Apple announced it sold 11.8 million iPads in the first quarter of this year, bringing the total sold to 67 million in roughly two years.

As such, the company has little obvious reason to tout the need, or desire, for a new kind of device when it's pounding the competition with the current one. ""The tablet market is going to be huge,"" Cook said. ""As the ecosystem gets better and better and we continue to double down on making great products, I think the limit here is nowhere in sight."" But some observers said Wednesday that Cook's reluctance to embrace a possible tablet-laptop convergence seems a bit ironic. ""That sounds familiar.

Which has sold 70 million units in the last six months."" He provided links to multiple articles, including his own, from 2007 that questioned whether a pricey phone that sends e-mail, surfs the Web, plays video games and lets you listen to iTunes would catch on. Or to put it differently, it was a product that combined a toaster, a refrigerator and a few other appliances to boot. ""The point is: sometimes convergence works,"" Rosoff wrote. ""If you combine features that people want in a smart way, and sell it at the right price, it can work. Tim Cook of all people should know that.""","Apple CEO: Tablet-PC hybrids are like combining toasters and refrigerators .

"Washington (CNN) -- Former federal judge and conservative legal scholar Robert Bork died early Wednesday at his Virginia home, his family confirmed to CNN. He was 85. Perhaps best known for his nomination to the Supreme Court by President Ronald Reagan in 1987, Bork was rejected for the post after a contentious confirmation battle led by left-leaning groups that opposed his conservative judicial philosophies. Bork had recently served as a senior legal adviser to Republican Mitt Romney's presidential campaign. He was a solicitor general during the Nixon administration and first gained notoriety for carrying out the president's order to fire the special prosecutor investigating the Watergate scandal in 1973, an episode known as the Saturday Night Massacre. But it was the Senate's rejection of his high court nomination that earned the conservative Bork a political legacy -- symbolic of the contentious, partisan nature of congressional confirmations. Bork was also known as a staunch advocate for ""originalism,"" a principle that defends the original intent of the Constitution. In recent years, Bork became a well-regarded conservative voice on legal and constitutional matters, as well as the author of several books including ""Slouching Toward Gomorrah: Modern Liberalism and American Decline."" He was also a frequent commentator. He told CNN in 2005 that he had to endure his failed nomination as a metaphor. To ""Bork"" someone has entered the popular lexicon as attacking a public figure in the media for partisan gain. ""My name became a verb,"" he said. ""And I regard that as one form of immortality."" Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, a longtime friend, described Bork as ""one of the most influential legal scholars of the past 50 years."" ""His impact on legal thinking in the fields of Antitrust and Constitutional Law was profound and lasting,"" said Scalia. ""More important for the final accounting, he was a good man and a loyal citizen. May he rest in peace."" Photos: 15 Supreme Court cases that changed America . Scalia and fellow conservative Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas followed Bork's example of a strict interpretation of the Constitution. That position made Bork ""one of the intellectual godfathers of the conservative movement in this country,"" according to CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. Robert Heron Bork was born in Pittsburgh in 1927 and attended the University of Chicago Law School, where his conservative leanings were forged. He was a Marine Corps veteran. After private practice and a teaching stint at Yale Law School, he was named to the Justice Department in 1973 at the height of the Watergate crisis. When Attorney General Elliot Richardson and his deputy William Ruckelshaus abruptly resigned rather than carry out orders to dismiss special prosecutor Archibald Cox, Bork stepped in and carried out Nixon's demands. He was criticized for bowing to political pressure but remained on the job. Nixon resigned a year later. Reagan named Bork in 1981 to the high-profile U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, where he served with future justices Scalia and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Bork was seriously considered for the 1986 high court vacancy that eventually went to Scalia, who still serves as the senior associate justice. The retirement a year later of Justice Lewis Powell promised an ideological sea change on the divided high court. Powell was a centrist and the court's key swing vote. The Reagan White House quickly focused on Bork, hoping it would move the court to the right. One major roadblock: Unlike the Scalia confirmation a year earlier, Democrats now controlled the Senate and were prepared for a fight. Bork's confirmation was the most bitter Washington had seen in years, and he was ultimately rejected by the Senate 58-42, the largest margin of defeat ever for a court nominee. From Robert Bork to Instagram in 7 steps . The concern for many senators was not one of qualification but of temperament. Bork's paper trail was extensive. He was an outspoken and prolific jurist with a clear, unapologetic conservative record. Civil rights groups and liberal lawmakers attacked his writings and rulings on voting, free speech and, especially, on reproductive rights. ""Robert Bork's America is a land in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, rogue police could break down citizens' doors in midnight raids, schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution,"" Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Massachusetts, said at the time. ""The doors of the federal courts would be shut on the fingers of millions of citizens."" During the nationally televised hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Bork sparred with lawmakers, strongly defending his ""originalist"" judicial philosophy and rejecting suggestions the Constitution was a ""flexible"" document that offered new rights in changing political and social times. Bork believed in ""strict constructionalism,"" that judges should rule based only on the text of the Constitution as it was originally enacted, and should not be seen as righting all social ills. In 2005, Bork told CNN's ""Larry King Live"" what made a good justice: ""A willingness to apply the Constitution according to the principles that are actually in it rather than what they call the 'evolving' or the 'living' Constitution,"" he said, ""which simply means the judges begin to make it up."" Friends and colleagues offered tributes to the conservative legal icon. ""Robert Bork was one of America's greatest jurists and a brilliant legal mind,"" said Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, a onetime constitutional lawyer and friend of the judge. ""He was an expert on issues ranging from antitrust to privacy laws and was deeply influential in promoting constitutional originalism. Despite the unfortunate and unnecessary controversy surrounding his Supreme Court nomination, Judge Bork remained an inspirational figure for those seeking to enforce constitutional limits on the federal government. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Bork family."" That political fight raised the stakes for future Supreme Court nominations, bringing a new level of intensity and partisanship to the process. Groups on both sides of the ideological debate saw advantages in pointing out the impact the high court and its nine justices have on the rule of law and the hot-button issues decided. The Supreme Court in June made a landmark opinion, upholding the sweeping health care reform law championed by President Obama. Rulings on affirmative action, voting rights and same-sex marriage can be expected by next June. Justices order another look at key health care provision . Years after the political fight, Bork admitted that the partisan rejection of his nomination was personally trying. He had stepped down from the bench a year after it. Bork suffered in past years with heart disease. Before his death, he was a distinguished fellow at the Hudson Institute, which researches and analyzes issues involving defense policy, international relations, health care, technology culture and law. The foundation's president and CEO, Kenneth Weinstein, said Bork will be missed. ""Robert Bork was a giant, a brilliant and fearless legal scholar, and a gentleman whose incredible wit and erudition made him a wonderful Hudson colleague,"" Weinstein said in a statement on the organization's website.

Maj. Steven Hutchison died in a roadside bomb attack last Sunday near Basra, Iraq. Maj. Steven Hutchison -- a 60-year-old soldier from Scottsdale, Arizona -- died Sunday in the southern Iraqi city of Basra after a bomb went off near his vehicle in the region. Hutchison spanned two war eras. He enlisted in the Army at 19 and served in Vietnam, according to a news report on CNN affiliate KNXV-TV. Hutchison wanted to serve again after the September 11 attacks, but his wife opposed that. His wife died of breast cancer in 2006, and Hutchison was ""devastated,"" his brother Richard Hutchison told KNXV. Steve Hutchison jogged, got into great physical shape and returned to Army active duty at age 57 in Afghanistan and then Iraq.

"(CNN) -- All three presidential debates are now in the books and the race to the White House is taking its final shape. Looking back, the first debate was undoubtedly the watershed moment of this campaign and the most powerful inflection point in the race to date. President Obama regained some lost ground in the next two debates, including Monday night's event, but the damage had already been done. Mitt Romney now carries the momentum into the home stretch. Like in the second debate, Obama came out Monday night more aggressive and more provocative. He threw more punches and landed more punches, centering his attacks on trying to characterize Romney's foreign policy as amateur and reckless. But there was an air of desperation in his delivery. It was as if he knew he needed to not just defeat Romney, but to destroy him. He fell far short of that bar. Opinion: Obama in command; Romney plays it safe . Obama was helped, however, by Romney's peculiar pass on contesting Libya and the Benghazi catastrophe while also not taking Obama to task for the timetable and withdrawal from Afghanistan. Romney's repeated agreement with Obama on issues like drone strikes and keeping U.S. forces out of Iran and Syria in any way may upset some conservatives. But we are at a different time and place in the foreign policy psyche of most Americans. The country is war-weary, wants the troops to come home and doesn't want any form of intervention in another country. Romney had to reassure voters that he was not interested in nation-building and provoking or initiating foreign conflicts. He accomplished that very well. It was a different test for a different time for a Republican candidate. He distanced himself from President George W. Bush and offered his own vision for the Middle East. Or as he put it, the United States should ""help the - the world of Islam and other parts of the world, reject this radical violent extremism."" Perhaps foreshadowing the last two weeks of the presidential race, Romney used the debate to move to the center. He emphasized peace and diplomacy and avoided at all costs any hint of sending U.S. forces to future wars. Romney also looked and acted presidential. He had a steady, levelheaded confidence and avoided any snarky, patronizing ""horses and bayonets"" moments. Obama used the final debate to go to the left and energize his base, attacking Romney at any opportunity while throwing in comments about teachers and classroom size -- a clear signal to his strong base with the teacher's union. Obama offered little on his plans for a second term and spent much of the debate hammering Romney. Opinion: Was Obama too relentless with Romney? That may be why some commentators think Romney acted and appeared more like the president and Obama the challenger. One of the central facets of the Obama campaign was to define Romney as an unacceptable candidate, which they did relentlessly in states like Ohio. Yet, Romney's first debate performance shattered that image. And through the rest of the debates, he proved that he is not the man they said he was; he is not a warmonger or greedy vulture capitalist. Now, Obama is racing to put the genie back in the bottle. The electoral map is shrinking for him while expanding for Romney. Paul Begala recently admitted the Obama campaign has given up on North Carolina. Meanwhile, GOP vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan recently campaigned in Pennsylvania, a state once thought to be totally out of the reach of Romney and Ryan. According to RealClearPolitics.com's electoral map, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania are now toss-up states and North Carolina is leaning Romney. With the wind at this back, Romney can now consolidate his resources in the most crucial states -- Ohio, Virginia, Colorado and perhaps even Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. And with the foreign policy debate in the rear view mirror, he can get back to the economy -- his strongest issue and advantage over the president. Opinion: So, who's going to win? In the latest WSJ/NBC poll Romney has a six point advantage on which candidate is better at dealing with the economy, a seven point lead on jobs and unemployment and a whopping 13 point lead on fixing the deficit. Romney has the momentum. Barring any October surprise, he will likely keep the momentum. With less than two weeks to go, it may matter less what Romney and Obama say but where they say it. That will tell us all we need to know about how the campaigns feel heading into the home stretch. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of William J. Bennett.","William Bennett: President Obama was aggressive in final debate, but it may be too late .

"(CNN) -- Britain's Prince Charles and his wife, Camilla, visited a camp for Syrian refugees in Jordan on Wednesday. The camp, run by the United Nations, UNICEF and Save the Children, is home to about 1,000 people who have fled the two-year Syrian civil war. Jordan has been receiving about 7,000 new refugees a day, according to UNICEF. While at the camp, children sang to the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall. The cost of war: 2 million Syrian children afflicted by trauma, disease, malnutrition . Their visit comes on the same day Save the Children issued a report saying that more than 2 million children have been afflicted by trauma, malnutrition or disease during the Syrian civil war. The war has interfered with vaccination efforts across the country, the group said. About two-thirds of Syrian children lack vaccinations for preventable diseases, according to the group's report. In addition, one in three children have been injured in the warfare, the report said. Meanwhile, in Syria, the European Union said Wednesday that an employee of its delegation in Syria died in a rocket attack in Derava, a Damascus suburb.

"London (CNN) -- Any day now, the Duchess of Cambridge is due to give birth to her and Prince William's first baby -- a new heir to the British throne. It is an event that has been eagerly awaited since Catherine's pregnancy was announced last December, but what will happen once the baby arrives? CNN runs through the expected schedule, although as with all births, be warned that anything can happen. Where will the baby be born? Catherine is expected to give birth in the private Lindo Wing at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, central London -- the same place where both Prince William and Prince Harry were born. The world's media -- CNN included -- are already staking out their positions in view of the hospital's front door, to try and ensure a front-row seat when the baby makes its debut in front of the cameras. If Catherine goes into labor while visiting her parents at Bucklebury in Berkshire, she may instead opt to give birth at the nearby Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading, where she herself was born. Will Prince William be there for the birth? Prince William serves as a search and rescue helicopter pilot in the Royal Air Force, and is based at RAF Valley on Anglesey in North Wales, about four and a half hours' drive from London. Like many other fathers-to-be in the military, he will not be taking time off before the baby's arrival, but when Catherine goes in to labor, it is expected that he will be flown by helicopter to Kensington Palace in order to be at his wife's side as soon as possible. Catherine's mother, Carole Middleton is also likely to be on hand at the hospital, in case William is unable to make it to London on time for any reason. Who will be the first to know about the birth? Once the royal baby is born, Queen Elizabeth II, British Prime Minister David Cameron, and the Governors General of each of the Commonwealth nations will be informed, along with the rest of the royal and Middleton families. If the baby arrives in the middle of the night, it seems unlikely that the 87-year-old monarch will be woken up, so there is a chance that in the event of an overnight delivery, an announcement would not be made until the following morning. When will the rest of the world know? After the baby is born, an official notice confirming the newborn's gender, weight and the time of its birth will be signed by Catherine's doctors. A palace official will bring this document out of the hospital -- this is the first indication the world will get that the royal baby has arrived -- and hand it to a messenger, who will take it to Buckingham Palace, under police guard. At the palace the notice will be put into a gilt frame, which will be positioned on an easel -- the same one that was used to announce the birth of Prince William -- and placed in the palace forecourt. This is the first time the world will know the gender of the baby. However, it could take anything up to 10 days before the new arrival's name is announced. After the birth is announced, Prince William is expected to make a statement outside the hospital, as are Kate's mother and father, Carole and Michael Middleton. Celebratory gun salutes will be sounded by the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery in Green Park (41 rounds) and the Honorable Artillery Company at the Tower of London (62 rounds). What will happen after the birth? In keeping with tradition, as she leaves St Mary's Hospital, Catherine is expected to appear on the steps of the building with her newborn, as Princess Diana did with Princes William and Harry. The next stop for the new family may be the Queen's estate at Sandringham in Norfolk, Balmoral in Scotland, or even the Middletons' home village of Bucklebury, in Berkshire, but exactly where the baby will spend its first weeks is being kept a closely-guarded secret. In the longer term, the royal couple plan to set up home at Kensington Palace, but they are not expected to move in there immediately. Catherine and William are said to be set on giving their baby as normal an upbringing as possible, and are reportedly not planning to employ a nanny -- though of course they have plenty of other staff to lend a hand. Considering the duchess came from a relatively ordinary background, it is not surprising they would want the same for their child -- as much as is feasible for a future British monarch, of course. CNN's Max Foster and David Wilkinson contributed to this report.","Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are eagerly awaiting the birth of their first baby .

"(CNN) -- Barely more than a week into the new school year and a gunman armed with an assault rifle has attacked an elementary school in Decatur, Georgia. Fortunately, the gunman was apprehended before anyone was injured or killed. Although the outcome of this most recent attack was significantly better than the carnage witnessed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, last December, parents need to be proactive when it comes to their children's school security plans. Before sending their precious little ones back to school, every parent should ask their school administrators the following questions: . 1. Does the school have a crisis response plan customized for its campus? Over the last decade, many states have mandated that schools have crisis response plans. This sounds like a good idea in theory. But because they were mandated, many schools have simply copied generic plans provided by the state or another school district in order to meet their legal requirements. Make sure that your school has a crisis response plan that has been specifically designed for its unique characteristics, demographics and personnel. 2. Does your campus regularly practice school safety drills? If your campus does not regularly practice basic school safety drills such as lockdowns, shelter-in-place and evacuations, ask the administrators why not? There is no good reason they can give you for not being prepared. The old adage ""practice makes perfect"" not only applies to reading, writing and arithmetic. Most school safety experts advise campuses to practice such drills at least once per semester with teachers and school staff also drilling during in-service training days. 3. What should parents do if there is an emergency at the school? Your school should be providing you with information regarding your role as a parent during a school crisis. Whom do you call? Where do you go? What do you when you get there? What documents do you need to bring, if any? Many school districts require all parents to show proper identification to pick up their child after a ""nontraditional release"" such as an evacuation. Make sure you know the school and districts policies for such an incident. 4. Have both staff and students received training on what to do during an active shooter incident? It is imperative that administrators and teachers know what to do during a school crisis but it is equally as important for students to know what to do to survive an incident. Demand to know exactly what training is provided to staff and students. Does the school provide materials so you can discuss the training with your child and provide additional practice if necessary? 5. Has the school partnered with its local law enforcement agency to practice emergency response procedures? Although many schools have crisis response plans, most have not taken time to personally work with their local law enforcement agencies to co-develop plans and practice drills. Real-time practice scenarios are essential to a comprehensive school safety plan. When school and law enforcement plans are not in sync with each other, important procedures that could save lives may be missing. We can never predict when something terrible will happen. But the least that you can do as a parent is to make sure your child's school has taken the necessary measures to act in the safest and best possible way should an unanticipated disaster -- such as a shooting -- occur. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Matthews.","A gunman armed with an assault rifle attacked an elementary school in Decatur, Georgia .

"Amman, Jordan (CNN) -- Sahab and her family were not willing refugees. Like many in Syria, they were forced to leave their family home and move several times to different locations to avoid the worsening security situation all around them. The final straw came when they hid for more than three hours, taking shelter under some stairs, as F16 planes attacked the town Al Quaryatayn, in Homs province. When it was safe to move, Sahab joined around 50 other people heading towards the border in a van that normally transports animals. From there, it was another five hour journey by foot, at night, in the freezing cold. The small bags of belongings they'd brought with them were mostly thrown away along the route as the going got harder; children lost their shoes as they stumbled in the dark and made the last part of their journey walking in just their socks or barefoot. ""We were just seeking a safe place to stay where no-one would attack us"", said 42 year-old Sahab, who I met with her family at the main reception centre in Jordan's Zaatari camp. More than 130,000 people are officially registered at Zaatari, which is struggling to cope with the flood of refugees. Read more: Syrian exodus reaches one million . ""We were terrified. Now we are here, we feel safer. But we'd like to be able to return to Syria as quickly as possible and for the fighting to end,"" Sahab told me. ""I want a decent, secure life, to have a life with dignity."" But aid agencies like mine are struggling to respond to the needs of people like Sahab and to provide them with basic services. Zaatari is a sprawling camp made up of canvas tents and prefab shelters in the Jordanian desert, close to the Syrian border, which has tripled in size in the last three months, in order to accommodate the thousands of refugees arriving every day. The Jordanian government wants to open at least two new camps to ease the congestion, but there's no funding. Hundreds of thousands of other refugees in Jordan, Lebanon and other countries bordering Syria, such as Turkey, Iraq and Egypt, are living in host communities, often in unheated, unfurnished buildings or makeshift shelters, where it is even harder for them to get the help they need. Read more: The faces of Syria's refugee crisis . In January, donors generously pledged to fund the U.N.'s largest-ever short-term emergency appeal to help those affected by the conflict in Syria, promising a massive $1.5 billion. But so far, most of the funds have failed to materialize. The U.N. says it has received just 20% of the money promised so far. That means some very difficult decisions will soon have to be made on the ground. The U.N. children's agency, UNICEF, which funds Oxfam's emergency work in Zaatari, where the agency is installing latrines, showers and washing areas, says it has only received 9% of the funds it needs for its work in Jordan. UNICEF has warned that without more money, it will have to scale back, even on life-saving interventions, including water, sanitation, hygiene work and child protection. Read more: Syrian war 'everybody's problem' The crisis is spiralling out of control. There are now one million registered refugees, though the true number is far higher, since many fleeing Syria choose not to register. An end to the conflict is nowhere in sight, meaning that the flood of refugees leaving the country is likely to continue. Host countries, including Lebanon and Jordan, must be commended for keeping their borders open and providing help. But the refugee numbers -- which currently account for 8% of Lebanon's total population and around 5% of the Jordanian population, are now straining limited resources. Tensions are starting to appear between local host populations, who until now have been extremely generous, and the new refugees, as there's greater competition for affordable housing, health and school facilities. Even if peace could be secured, that doesn't address the longer-term issue: Funding will be needed to help families rebuild their shattered lives, for months and years to come. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Caroline Gluck.","The number of refugees fleeing Syria's civil war has reached one million .

"Paris (CNN) -- A French writer filed a criminal complaint Tuesday against embattled former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn, alleging attempted rape, according to her attorney David Koubbi. Tristane Banon, 32, filed the new claim just as a separate New York case against the French financier appeared to be on shaky ground. A Strauss-Kahn lawyer in France said he had filed a counterclaim against Banon for ""false declarations."" French prosecutors are expected to review the complaint and determine whether there is enough evidence to press charges. Though the alleged attack occurred in 2003, the statute of limitations on attempted rape is 10 years. In an interview with the French news-magazine L'Express, Banon said she decided to act because she was fed up with being labelled a liar, having not previously filed a criminal complaint. Banon said Strauss-Kahn's alleged assault had been widely discussed in light of the charges he faces in New York and she now had a chance to tell her own story and be listened to. ""If I want one day to put an end to this hell of the past eight years, it has to go to court,"" she told the magazine. Asked about the delay in coming forward to report the attempted rape, Banon said it was difficult for all women in this situation. She added that she had been reluctant to go over and over the details, when all she wanted to do was forget about it. It was even harder to face that prospect when the she knew that the attempt would likely fail, she told L'Express, because no-one would believe the word of a young writer over a powerful figure like Strauss-Kahn. Asked if she had concerns about repercussions for bringing the complaint now, Banon told L'Express she feared reprisals because she was a thorn in the side of the former IMF chief . On Tuesday, her attorney told CNN that the alleged attack had taken place with ""extreme violence."" The new legal fireworks came after questions arose about the truthfulness of a housekeeper who alleged that Strauss-Kahn, 62, attacked her in his New York hotel suite in May. Banon said the decision to file the complaint had been taken with her lawyer in mid-June and had not been affected by the sudden crumbling of the case against Strauss-Kahn in New York, according to her interview with L'Express. One of Strauss-Kahn's lawyers in New York, Benjamin Brafman, on Monday declined to comment on the allegations in France. Banon's mother, Socialist politician Anne Mansouret, said shortly after the housekeeper's accusations were splashed across front pages around the world that her daughter had been attacked by Strauss-Kahn in 2003 but that she had discouraged her at the time from filing charges against him. Mansouret, a member of parliament, said she cautioned Banon not to file a police report at the time for fear it would hurt her journalism career. On Tuesday, she said she had not realized before how much her daughter was affected by the alleged incident. ""At the time, I never thought that it had traumatized her to such a point,"" she told CNN affiliate network BFM. Banon ""expects to be destroyed"" after filing the complaint against Strauss-Kahn, her mother added. But she must ""find the combative instinct that is needed to withstand the shock and say to herself, 'OK, I must do this and I will carry it out,'"" Mansouret said. Strauss-Kahn was never charged in connection with the alleged attack on Banon. But in light of the charges against Strauss-Kahn after the alleged incident at a Sofitel hotel in New York, Koubbi said a few weeks ago that he and Banon had considered filing a complaint. Koubbi said the cases were not connected. ""I don't see any reason why these two cases should be joined, because either the prosecutor has enough elements to condemn Dominique Strauss-Kahn in the United States -- and if he does, he should do it -- or he needs to bring two cases together to get a conviction,"" he said in June. ""In that case, we do not want to participate,"" he added. Strauss-Kahn's attorney in France, Leon Lef Forster, did not respond to requests for comment on the allegations in May. Mansouret recently pulled out of the Socialist Party presidential primaries. Strauss-Kahn had been a front-runner for the party nomination until the New York arrest, and suggestions that the case was floundering have revived talk of his chances in next year's presidential elections. Mansouret described herself last week as ""the woman who embarrasses the Socialist Party."" ""I am ... a sort of collateral damage in the DSK affair. I knew for a long time that my political career was sealed with this bomb, but I didn't imagine that this bitter past could be revived so violently,"" she wrote Friday on the Rue89 website, referring to the alleged attack in New York. In May, Mansouret said that in 2003, her journalist daughter had interviewed Strauss-Kahn in his office in the National Assembly. However, after the interview, Banon received a text message from Strauss-Kahn, saying he was not happy with the interview and asking if he could speak with her again, Mansouret said. After Banon arrived at the address Strauss-Kahn had sent her, he locked the door to the room they were in, took her hand and grabbed her arm, according to Mansouret. Banon told him to let her go, and the incident ended with the two struggling on the floor, Mansouret said. Banon managed to escape the apartment and locked herself in her car, where she called her mother. Mansouret said she arrived about an hour and a half later to find her daughter still locked in the car and looking ""roughed up."" The heel of one shoe was broken, Mansouret recalled. But Mansouret told her daughter not to file a complaint out of concern that she would become known as Strauss-Kahn's victim. CNN does not typically identify sexual assault victims, but Mansouret said her daughter gave permission for her name to be disclosed. In New York, the prosecution's case against Strauss-Kahn has been shaken in recent days after sources revealed that the housekeeper at the Sofitel hotel had been less than truthful with investigators. Within two days after the alleged attack occurred, she spoke by phone with a boyfriend in an Arizona jail in a recorded conversation. A source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN that the housekeeper said ""she's fine and this person is rich and there's money to be made,"" as originally reported by The New York Times. The 32-year-old immigrant has admitted to prosecutors that she lied about her whereabouts following the alleged attack, the details of an asylum application and information she put on tax forms, according to documents filed in court Friday by prosecutors. Prosecutors said Friday that the woman also admitted to lying about being a victim of a gang rape. In angry remarks delivered outside the courthouse, the woman's attorney, Kenneth Thompson, acknowledged problems with his client's credibility. But the bottom line, he said, is that she was attacked. ""That was true the day it happened, and it is true today,"" Thompson said. ""She has described that sexual assault many times to the prosecutors and to me. And she has never once changed a single thing about that account."" On Tuesday, the attorney for the alleged victim's announced that she had filed a libel lawsuit against the New York Post and five of its reporters, after the newspaper reported that the woman was a prostitute. The woman has accused the newspaper of publishing articles with false and defamatory information in the effort to bolster sales. A spokeswoman for the New York Post, Suzi Halpin, responded to the lawsuit Tuesday, saying ""we stand by our reporting."" Meanwhile, the indictment and charges against Strauss-Kahn -- including criminal sexual acts and sexual abuse -- still stand. And though he is now free to travel in the United States, a judge said authorities have continued to withhold the French financier's passport. After the charges were filed against him in New York, Strauss-Kahn resigned as director of the International Monetary Fund.

"(CNN) -- Imagine you're about to travel to a foreign land. You've heard it can be a mighty dangerous place, but you have to go there -- you have no choice. You don't know exactly where the threats lurk, and you don't speak the language. Wouldn't it be nice to have a guide? Nurse Susan Gonzalez stopped a hospital nurse from giving her father a drug to which he is allergic. In many ways, a hospital is like that foreign land, and the guides that know the terrain are the nurses. As many as 98,000 people die in U.S. hospitals each year as a result of medical errors, according to an Institute of Medicine report. Some 99,000 people die each year from infections acquired in the hospital, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Vigilance is key, says Cindy Sellers O'Brien, president of the mid-Maryland chapter of the Emergency Nurses Association. ""The patients that do better are the ones that take an active role in their health care. They have the better outcomes [because] they take more ownership."" The American Hospital Association agrees that patients play a crucial role. ""While we are striving for perfection in the way we deliver care, we know we fall short of that mark -- but patients can help us get better,"" says Nancy Foster, AHA's vice president for quality and patient safety policy. ""They can -- and should -- ask questions when something does not seem quite right."" The consequences of medical errors are especially devastating for children, according to the Joint Commission, which accredits hospitals nationwide. This week the commission released tips for keeping your child safe in the hospital, noting that according to its figures, one in 15 hospitalized children is harmed by medication errors. A study out last week from the University of Michigan found that nearly two-thirds of parents reported they felt the need to watch over their child's hospital care to make sure no one made any mistakes. Given the dangers lurking in hospitals, we asked several nurses to give us their suggestions about what steps to take to protect yourself and your family.  Watch more on avoiding hospital mistakes » . 1. Bring in a list of the medications you're taking . This is one of the most important things you can do to ensure your safety, according to a survey of 731 nurses by Consumer Reports. It's best to have the list in your wallet in case you're taken to the emergency room. Rita Kobert, a nurse in Fredericksburg, Virginia, who has a seizure disorder, told Consumer Reports she learned this lesson long ago. ""If I fall from a seizure ... and have to go to the hospital, I already have a printout of medications,"" she said. 2. Make sure the hospital gets your name right . Last year, Michelle Waddy, a freelance pediatric nurse practitioner in Roanoke, Virginia, suffered a drop in hemoglobin and needed four units of blood immediately. ""The emergency room nurse entered my name on the computer wrong. I was given blood under another patient's name,"" she wrote to us. Waddy says she caught the error, but the hospital continued to use the wrong name. ""Luckily they had to get my blood type before I was given blood, or I wouldn't be telling this story."" 3. Ask about every medication they give you . Nurses say to double-check the name, dosage, and timing of every medicine you receive in the hospital. Susan Gonzalez, a nurse in Austell, Georgia, caught a medication error just in time. She was visiting her father in the hospital when a nurse came to give him an intravenous medicine. ""I asked them, 'What are you hanging?' "" she said. The nurse answered it was ampicillin, an antibiotic. ""I was like, 'My dad is allergic,' and they said, 'Oh, you're right.' That could have been a fatal outcome."" 4. Make sure everyone washes hands . In the Consumer Reports survey, 26 percent of the nurses reported observing hand-washing lapses. ""It seems like a simple little thing, but doctors and nurses pick up a lot of nasty germs and then transmit them to other patients,"" Dr. Howard Blumstein told Consumer Reports. Blumstein is a vice president of the American Academy of Emergency Medicine and practices in North Carolina. Since it can be an uncomfortable conversation, Consumer Reports has a list of ways to ask a doctor or nurse to wash up. Here's advice on preventing hospital infections from the American Hospital Association, the American Medical Association, and the National Patient Safety Board. 5. If you think something's wrong, don't back down . O'Brien, the nurse from Maryland, said she had to fight to stop her mother from receiving a dangerous medication during an emergency visit to the hospital. She says her mother, who had breast cancer, was supposed to receive a dose of a steroid called Decadron before her chemotherapy sessions. She said someone in the hospital made a mistake and wrote in her mother's chart that she was supposed to receive Decadron every twelve hours. O'Brien begged the nurses to take her mother off the 12-hour schedule of Decadron, explaining that she was a diabetic and it could hurt her heart. Within 10 minutes of talking to the nurse, her mother experienced chest pain and had a heart attack, O'Brien recalls, adding that her mother survived. O'Brien says don't give up if you think something's wrong. ""You don't need to be aggressive, nasty, and mean. Be convincing and confident,"" she said. CNN's Sabriya Rice and Jennifer Pifer Bixler contributed to this report.","Medical errors kill up to 98,000 U.S. hospital patients a year .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Nine bodies -- eight of them burned -- have been pulled from vehicles crushed in a tunnel collapse about 80 kilometers (50 miles) west of Tokyo, a highway police spokesperson said early Monday. Five of those were recovered in one charred station wagon, and three others were in another burned vehicle, according to the police spokesperson. The other fatality was in a truck. The Sasago tunnel on the Chuo Expressway remained closed Monday morning, one day after the cave-in occurred on the highway's Tokyo-bound lanes, Otsuki police said. Officials from the East Yamanashi Fire Department said the section of concrete that fell was about 50 to 60 meters long and about 20 centimeters (8 inches) thick. Soon after the collapse, Japanese public broadcaster NHK aired images showing smoke rising, a blue car with its side smashed in, and emergency vehicles on the scene. Crews worked through the night trying to get to victims, all the while wary that the tunnel might collapse further. Those efforts continue, and authorities have not said if they believe more bodies will be found. The privately held Central Nippon Expressway Company operates the 4.7-kilometer-long Sasago tunnel, among others, as well as expressways and toll roads around Japan. Central Nippon Expressway conducts annual inspections of the tunnel, with one particularly thorough inspection held every five years, a company spokesperson said. A more intensive inspection of the Sasago tunnel was held sometime in the past two to three months, the spokesperson added. The Chuo Expressway is a particularly busy stretch of highway that runs between Tokyo and, among other places, Mount Fuji. While it is a ways from the Japanese capital, the partial tunnel collapse and its subsequent closure is expected to cause major traffic and other headaches, especially for those who rely on it for business. Authorities have not given any indication as to when they expect the tunnel to reopen, nor is it clear why the collapse occurred. Are you there? Share you stories, videos and images.","NEW: 5 of the bodies are found in a burned station wagon, police say .

"(WIRED) -- You should care about Apple's collection of geodata on iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices, because the method is flawed. To be clear, ""care"" doesn't mean you should smash your iPhone with a hammer, rip out the GPS chip and gulp it down your throat. This isn't an issue of ""Big Brother is watching."" It's just a matter of a security flaw that puts your location data at risk if it gets in the wrong hands -- not an immediate concern, but a concern nonetheless. Two data scientists broke the news Wednesday that an unencrypted file stored on iOS devices contains a detailed log of the device's geographical data dating back 10 months. The scientists also wrote a program, allowing you to plug in your iOS device and automatically output the geodata into an interactive map, just so you could see for yourself. As this story developed, some tech observers have attempted to defuse the issue. ""So what?"" David Pogue wrote in his New York Times column. ""I have nothing to hide. Who cares if anyone knows where I've been?"" Here's why we care. Permanent data storage is unnecessary . As WIRED.com pointed out yesterday, Apple already admitted and explained that it deliberately stores geodata on its mobile devices so the company can collect it to improve location services. The general process, summarized: Whenever you use an app with a location service -- the Yelp app, for instance, to find nearby restaurants -- the iPhone gets information about nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points, and stores the info. Every 12 hours, an iOS device's stored geodata gets anonymized with a random string of numbers, and it gets transmitted to Apple in a batch. Apple says it keeps all this data in its own database, so it can provide you quicker and more precise location services. So when you use a location-based app, such as your Maps app to get your location, you're first pulling data from Apple's geo database to get your general location, and then your GPS chip homes in on a more precise latitude and longitude. Apple's location database speeds up the location process. Location gathering techniques like this aren't anything new. For instance, when using an app like Google Maps app on your Android phone, some of your location data is cached -- or stored -- so that if your network connection is interrupted, following directions on the map won't be. Data caching also improves the speed of an app's performance. ""It makes such a huge difference when you can cache this data,"" Andreas Schobel, CTO of Android-app--developing studio Catch.com. ""Cellphone connections are incredibly high in latency. Imagine having to wait half-a-second longer when sending a tweet with your location included. From a user experience point of view, these caches make sense."" But the problem remains that there is no reason for that geo data to remain on your device after it's transmitted to Apple. In contrast to Apple, Google's stance on the position is clear: It has been upfront about location data collection from the start. In a statement provided to WIRED.com, Google says as much: . All location sharing on Android is opt-in by the user. We provide users with notice and control over the collection, sharing and use of location in order to provide a better mobile experience on Android devices. Any location data that is sent back to Google location servers is anonymized and is not tied or traceable to a specific user. This is true for both Android and iPhones, but it's no longer the point. Having a data file with over a year's worth of your location information stored on your iPhone is a security risk. So if a thief got his hands on your iPhone, he can figure out where you live and loot you there, too. Same goes for a hacker who gains remote access to the consolidated.db file. But if a thief or hacker dug into an Android device, there isn't going to be much geodata saved on the smartphone to digitally stalk you. (There's plenty of other data on smartphones such as text messages, address books and so forth, but at least we have control over what data we store in this regard.) Bottom line, this data shouldn't stick around on your iOS device, because it does nothing but put you at risk. And you should care about that, because this problem can be and should be fixed by Apple, and you should demand that. The database makes a tempting target for law enforcement . If police wanted to, they could subpoena the iPhone's location database file when investigating a suspect. That file contains too much information for this to even be justified. Imagine if you were suspected of a crime and police wanted to know where you were at 5 p.m. Thursday. They could subpoena your iPhone, dig into this file and, looking at the various data points, get a good idea of where you were at that time. Sure, that sounds like it could be a useful practice for busting bad criminals, but what about all that other data? With that file police can not only find out where you were at 5 p.m. Thursday, but also that you see a therapist every Monday morning, or simply that you were somewhere that you'd want to keep to yourself -- private matters. As tempting as it may be to say, ""They're suspected for a crime, they deserve it,"" even suspects deserve privacy. They're suspects, after all, not criminals (yet). The fact that law enforcement can easily get more information than necessary is not a positive thing. But it's not a huge immediate danger . With that said, the chances are small that your iPhone is going to get hacked or stolen, or that you're going to be suspected of a crime (we would hope). So there's no reason to freak out. But we should care about the implications of a rich file of geographic data living on our iOS devices offering no customer benefit, creating digital footprints that we can't erase. Fortunately, Apple is a media giant, and customer trust is too valuable for the company to lose. It's likely we'll see Apple issue a software update soon tweaking the geodata-storage method, hopefully with a full explanation.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Authorities are looking for art thieves who made off with a collection of Andy Warhol paintings from a private residence last week, police in Los Angeles, California, said Friday. Three of the Andy Warhol works stolen from a private collection: Chris Evert, Muhammad Ali and Pele. The stolen pieces included large pop-art portraits of several famous athletes, including tennis pro Chris Evert, basketball great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, soccer legend Pelé and Major League Baseball pitcher Tom Seaver, police said. The multimillion-dollar collection had been displayed in the dining room of Richard Weisman, a Los Angeles businessman whose portait is among the missing items, police said. The theft was discovered by one of Weisman's employees and occurred between September 2 and 3, police said. A $1 million reward has been offered for information leading to the recovery of the art.","Thieves made off with 11 Andy Warhol pieces from a private residence last week .

"(CNN) -- Iran's foreign minister Tuesday called on Yemen's neighbors to stay out of the conflict between Yemeni forces and Shiite Muslim rebels, while Yemen said it had seized an Iranian ship near its territorial waters. Manouchehr Mottaki told reporters in Tehran that Shiite-dominated Iran has expressed its concern for Yemen's ""national unity and territorial integrity,"" the state-run Press TV network reported. ""We strongly advise regional and neighboring states not to interfere in Yemen's internal affairs and try to restore peace and stability to the state,"" Mottaki said, adding, ""Those who choose to fuel the flames of conflict must know that the fire will reach them."" Battles between Yemeni government forces and the Shiite Houthi rebel movement have raged intermittently for five years in northern Yemen, where government troops launched a new offensive in late summer. The conflict is considered to be separatist and sectarian, pitting the Houthi against the country's Sunni majority. Saudi Arabia, Yemen's northern neighbor, turned its air force against suspected Houthi rebels last week. The Saudi government said an armed group had infiltrated into its territory and fired on border guards, leaving three members of the Saudi security forces dead and 15 wounded before the airstrikes pushed them back. The Houthi claimed the airstrikes occurred within Yemeni territory, a claim both the Saudi and Yemeni governments denied. Meanwhile, Yemen has accused Iran of supporting the rebels. A Yemeni government official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the issue, told CNN that Yemen's navy was ""on the highest state of alert"" and watching for any possible smuggling of weapons to the Houthi. The official said an Iranian boat was captured near Yemeni and Saudi territorial waters last week and was being towed to the Yemeni navy's headquarters at Hudeidah, on the Red Sea. The persistent fighting has raised concerns that Yemen -- where U.S. officials say al Qaeda is attempting to establish a new foothold in the region -- could be the stage for a proxy struggle between Iran and the Sunni-led Saudi monarchy. But the Yemeni official said the conflict in his country ""is not a sectarian war."" ""The main reason for fighting this group is that it's up in arms in rebellion against Yemen's government and it is challenging the legitimacy of Yemen's central government in Sanaa,"" he said. ""The constitution of Yemen gives the government the right to defend the sovereignty and unity of Yemen. The leadership of the insurgency has a sectarian ideology, but that doesn't mean Yemen is involved in a sectarian battle."" CNN's Mohammed Jamjoom contributed to this report.","Yemen's Sunni government, Shiite Houthi rebels have fought intermittently for years .

"BOGOTA, Colombia (CNN) -- All that glitters may not be gold, but for Colombia's narco-molls the most important thing is that it glitters. Yovanna Guzman was 19 when she met drug  boss Wilber Varela, and she says he showered her with luxuries. Beauty queens, fashion models, actresses or regular girls made good are lovers of drug capos and above all lovers of the finest luxuries that cocaine money can buy. Few are prepared to speak publicly and even less to appear on camera. Those who date mob bosses don't want to blow their cover. It could expose their boyfriends to arrest and themselves to retaliation. In addition, it could bring anti-drug police sniffing, ready to seize ill-gotten gains. One exception is Yovanna Guzman, a former beauty queen and model, with a mane of blond hair and a pneumatic figure -- a sure passport into the narco underworld where cup size is more important than IQ. For eight years, she was the lover of one of Colombia's most ruthless cocaine traffickers, Wilber Varela. He was head of the North Valle Cartel. ""He had two faces. I saw him so tender with the ones he loved, then you see the cartel killings. He always said he was the best of friends and the worst of enemies,"" Guzman said during an interview in Bogota.  Watch Guzman describe Varela and how she met him » . The Colombian government accused Varela of running tons of cocaine to the United States via Central America in go-fast speedboats and to Europe in small jets. Should drugs be legalized? Sound off below . Authorities put a $5 million bounty on his head. He gained a reputation for brutality during a yearslong dispute with a splinter faction of the same cartel, led by Diego Montoya, who until his capture in 2007 was listed alongside Osama bin Laden on the FBI's list of the 10 most-wanted fugitives. Guzman was 19 when she met Varela. He told her he was a cattle rancher. She didn't ask questions and said she only found out the truth when she saw a Wanted poster with her boyfriend's mug shot. He wooed her with expensive gifts and sponsored her through Chica Med, a second-rate beauty pageant organizers concede was viewed as a cattle market by gangsters looking for new girls. Some mob bosses bought the beauty title as a gift for their molls, though it's not clear whether Varela paid for Guzman's title. ""There were the vacations, the cars and the luxury SUVs and, of course, jewelry. There was always jewelry. But there were small details too like flowers,"" she said. ""Of course, the luxuries don't make you fall in love, but they do dazzle you. When you get dazzled, you get carried away, but then you ask yourself where is the love and my principles?"" Guzman said Varela's first gift to her was a Rolex watch, followed by a Cartier watch, diamonds, jewelry, top-of-the-range sport utility vehicles and luxury apartments. She said she now realizes she was being bought and admits she sold herself. ""I feel all of us have a price up to a point. Sometimes you feel luxuries like the designer clothes, shoes and handbags are important. But afterward you realize you're empty inside,"" she said. Very quickly her drug lord boyfriend locked Guzman in a golden cage. He forbade her to do photo shoots or party with male friends, even though he had a stable of other top model girlfriends. ""He was very jealous, and what's his is his and belongs to nobody else and nobody can touch it, look at it or mess with it,"" she said. As Colombia's law enforcers stepped up the hunt for Varela, Guzman's time with him became less frequent. But she said he always seemed to know where she was or to whom she had talked. At one point, she said, a jealous Varela sent one of his lieutenants to shoot her in the leg. ""When I got shot, I was supposedly never going to walk properly again. The bullet could easily have hit me somewhere else and killed me. But I pulled myself together and I said I'm not going to be crippled,"" she said. What Guzman wouldn't explain was the reason for the punishment shooting. She giggled and promised to reveal the full details in a book she's writing. She said she hopes her experiences will serve as a cautionary tale for other young women on the trail of easy money. Whether or not they will take a leaf out of that book is another matter. Ordinary Colombians seem to have an unshakable attraction to glamorous narco-lifestyles judging by the sky-high ratings of two TV soap operas. The ""Cartel"" tells the story of the rise of the North Valle mob that Varela headed. The sequel, called ""Mafia Dolls,"" portrays women such as Guzman. One of the silicone-enhanced actresses who played a supporting role in both soaps said that since her TV appearances she has received offers from real-life drug dealers, both in Medellin and Cali. ""Those narcos watch TV and are always on the lookout for fresh meat. So I began getting the calls when I appeared in 'The Cartel,' "" she said. ""I got a phone call from a guy who is a showbiz publicist, and he told me a guy from Medellin was offering $7,500 for me to spend the evening with him."" She said she refused that overture. Days later, a new BMW X5 SUV, with a bow on top, was left outside her home by the same drug trafficker who was trying to woo her. She said she returned the gift but gave no explanation how she found out the return address, given how secretive Colombian mob bosses are. ""All those narcos care about is how big your breasts are. If they want you, the first thing they do is send you to their plastic surgeons to have silicone implants. But it's them who decide how big you should be, not you,"" she went on. Guzman dares tell her story now for a simple reason -- Varela is dead. He was slain last year by one of his power-hungry lieutenants eager to take over the business. It marked the end of a nightmare she walked into with her eyes wide open. ""[When I heard the news], I didn't know whether to be happy or sad. Varela had his good side, but my freedom doesn't have a price,"" she said. ""I felt the golden cage had been flung open, and I could fly again.""","Former girlfriend of Colombian drug lord admits being bought by luxuries .

"(CNN) -- You knew Tony Soprano from the small things. The way he chewed his cigar in the opening credits of ""The Sopranos."" The way he shuffled to get his newspaper, sloppily clad in a white bathrobe. The way his voice changed, from a schmooze to a bark, when he talked to his psychiatrist. The way he killed. James Gandolfini was a master of the small things. ""I remember telling him many times: 'You don't get it. You're like Mozart,' "" David Chase, who created ""The Sopranos,"" said in a statement. Gandolfini died Wednesday night while on vacation in Italy. He was 51. The cause of death was not announced but was believed to be a heart attack. Before ""The Sopranos,"" Gandolfini -- a one-time truck driver and bartender who didn't turn to acting until he was in his mid-20s -- was a well-regarded character actor on stage and screen. He had a small role in the 1992 Broadway revival of ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" with Alec Baldwin and Jessica Lange, and appeared in such films as the Quentin Tarantino-written ""True Romance"" (1993), ""Get Shorty"" (1995) and ""A Civil Action"" (1998). Though his roles were limited, he invested them with beauty and invention. But he appeared destined for a career as the supporting actor until ""The Sopranos"" came along. ""The Sopranos"" was TV on a knife's edge. The HBO show, which put the cable network on the map for original material, could have been farce, could have been tragedy, could have been slasher film or kitchen-sink drama or gangster-movie parody. And, in fact, it was all these things, held together on screen by Gandolfini as woebegone Mafia chief (or was that ""waste management professional""?) Tony Soprano. Tony Soprano was an unusual protagonist, especially for a television show: a violent, brutal mob boss, a beleaguered patriarch, a calculating businessman. It was as if ""The Godfather's"" Sonny, Vito and Michael Corleone had been combined into one hulking bear of a figure. It could have been otherwise. Opinion: Gandolfini's gift to television -- and America . Gandolfini was one of three finalists for the role, Alan Sepinwall observed in his terrific TV history, ""The Revolution Was Televised."" He was chosen because, Chase said, ""the show I envisioned is the show that's got Jimmy in it. It's a much darker show with Jimmy in it."" ""At one time, I had said that this thing could be like a live-action 'Simpsons,' "" Chase told Sepinwall. ""Once I saw him do it, I thought, 'No, that's not right. It can be absurdist, it can have a lot of stupid s*** in it, but it should not be a live-action 'Simpsons.' "" In fact, what it became was the best-written show in TV history, according to a recent survey by the Writers Guild of America. Many episodes were as rich as novels, or as finely wrought as a good short story. Writing, however, will only take you so far; you need actors to inhabit those characters. And with Gandolfini, Edie Falco, Michael Imperioli, Lorraine Bracco and so many more, ""The Sopranos"" gave life to the scripts. Fans can pick their favorites, but two episodes stand out for Gandolfini's performances. One, ""Whitecaps,"" includes a scene between him and Falco (as Tony's wife, Carmela) that was as raw and painful as watching an argument between your parents. (If the pair had ever starred in ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"", ticket-sellers could have made a fortune.) The other, ""Join the Club,"" features an out-of-body experience in which Tony -- in a coma -- imagines he's an optics salesman named Kevin Finnerty. Here, Gandolfini drops Tony's New Jersey accent and with it, his tough-guy veneer. He's suddenly reasonable, open, somehow brighter. Special effects foreman: ""So long, paisan"" It's easy to confuse actors with their most famous roles; with this one episode, Gandolfini showed that he was no more Tony Soprano than he was Kevin Finnerty, but that he was playing them. Brilliantly. ""If anything, Gandolfini often took things further than Chase had planned,"" Sepinwall wrote. In the pilot, a scene ""called for Tony to slap Christopher (Imperioli) lightly across the face; instead, Gandolfini picked up the smaller Imperioli to make his displeasure clear."" (He worked to get himself into Tony's frame of mind, Gandolfini told ""Inside the Actors Studio,"" as noted in The New York Times' obituary. He'd stay up all night, put a rock in his shoe. ""It's silly, but it works,"" he said.) ""The Sopranos"" gave Gandolfini fame and wealth; he got in a contract dispute before the fifth season, eventually winning a contract worth around $13 million, according to a Variety report at the time. But instead of pursuing Hollywood leading roles, he immersed himself in his craft and his interests. He played a general in ""In the Loop"" and the CIA director in ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" neither role showy or outsized. He starred in the Broadway production of ""God of Carnage"" and was nominated for a Tony. He produced documentaries about wounded soldiers. Galdolfini left his mark on New Jersey . Among his last roles was in Chase's little-seen ""Not Fade Away,"" which came out last year. In it, Gandolfini plays another New Jersey sad sack, this one a 1960s grocer failing to connect with his rock 'n' roll-besotted son. He could have played the part as a ""Great Santini""-like martinet, or a befuddled softie, or an ignorant suburban climber. Instead, he manages to fill it with grace notes, amused one minute, frustrated the next, finally a loving father quietly handing his son some money as the boy prepares to drive away. He was a complicated, three-dimensional figure, and he gave the movie unexpected depth. Gandolfini will almost certainly be best remembered for Tony Soprano, his role of a lifetime. It's a shame that lifetime was so brief. The master of the small things left a legacy that looms large.

"(CNN) -- North Carolina lawmakers passed a measure that requires residents to present photo identification to vote, joining a handful of other states that have approved the controversial proposal. The Republican-dominated House approved the measure late Thursday night , saying it will help prevent voter fraud. It passed the state's Senate a day earlier. ""A measure that restores confidence in our election process and ensures voters are who they say they are is a no-brainer -- and nearly three-quarters of North Carolinians agree,"" said Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Berger. ""This bill will bring North Carolina in line with the majority of other states that already require voter ID."" In the past two years, at least 11 states have approved laws requiring voters to show identification at voting booths. 'Attacks democracy at its core' But critics slammed it as an effort to disenfranchise poor, minority and disabled voters . It ""attacks democracy at its core"" by making it harder for eligible voters, the American Civil Liberties Union of North Carolina said. ""Many of these restrictions, such as eliminating pre-registration for 16 and 17-year-olds, and disallowing use of college IDs at the polls, will severely discourage young people from participating in elections,"" the group said in a statement. N.C. abortion bill passes Senate, heads to governor . ""Others, such as shortening early voting and making it more difficult to set up satellite polling stations will be extremely burdensome for elderly and disabled voters who rely on such methods to cast their votes."" It listed what it described as ""harsh provisions"" in the measure, including eliminating same-day voter registration, shortening early voting and eliminating state-mandated voter registration drives. Proponents of the bill say it will stop voter fraud, asserting that having a valid, government-issued photo identification is a reasonable, modern-day necessity. 'Common-sense provision' A poll this year showed that more than 72% of North Carolina residents support requiring voters to show photo ID before being casting their ballot, according to Berger. He described it as a ""hugely popular, common-sense"" provision. Last month, the Supreme Court voted to halt the enforcement requirements of the Voting Rights Act. Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act required some states with a history of voter discrimination to get ""precleared"" by the federal government before making any changes to voting laws. North Carolina was among those states. The high court's ruling essentially allows states to make adjustments to voting laws without ""preclearance"" from the federal government. Requests by Texas and Mississippi for clearance in their voter ID laws were pending with the federal government when the high court struck down Section 5. Federal government steps in . Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday expressed displeasure with last month's change in the Voting Rights Act. ""For nearly five decades, ... preclearance served as a potent tool for addressing inequities in our election systems. Although preclearance originated during the Civil Rights Movement -- and was informed by a history of discrimination -- the conduct that it was intended to address continues to this day,"" he said. Holder said he has directed the Justice Department to ask a Texas federal court to subject the state to a condition similar to preclearance rights. He said there is evidence of racial discrimination in the state, and thus it should be forced to go through a federal preapproval before implementing voting changes. He said this will not be the Justice Department's last action to protect voting tights. It will continue monitoring jurisdictions nationwide for changes that may hamper these voting rights, Holder said. States that may wish to implement their voter ID laws may still face another hurdle, as civil rights groups and even the federal government could seek legal action to block the laws under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, another part of the law that works to prevent discrimination.","The Republican-dominated House approves the measure Thursday night .
In two years,11 states have approved laws requiring voters to show ID at voting booths .
Critics slam it as an effort to disenfranchise the poor, minority and disabled voters ."
"Tokyo (CNN) -- A powerful earthquake struck off the northeast coast of Japan on Friday evening, rattling buildings in Tokyo and setting off a small tsunami. It also jarred nerves in a nation still recovering from the devastating earthquake and tsunami in March 2011 that killed thousands of people and triggered the world's worst nuclear crisis in a quarter century. Some roads were closed and rail services suspended in the northeastern prefecture of Miyagi, where a one-meter (3-foot) tsunami rolled ashore. It was followed by four other waves ranging from eight to 16 inches. Only minor injuries were reported immediately, including five in Miyagi and five on the outskirts of Tokyo. Miyagi was one of the areas that suffered the worst of the destruction from the 9.0-magnitude quake and resulting tsunami in 2011. The weaker, 7.3-magnitude quake on Friday took place further out at sea -- 462 kilometers (287 miles) east-northeast of Tokyo at a depth of 36 kilometers (22 miles) -- the U.S. Geological Survey said, slightly revising the initial location it gave. It didn't create a widespread threat of a tsunami in the Pacific, according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center. The massive earthquake and tsunami in 2011 killed more than 15,000 people in Japan. It caused the formation of 30-foot walls of water that swept away rice fields, engulfed entire towns, and tossed houses and cars onto highways. The combined natural disasters did severe damage to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, setting off meltdowns at reactors at the facility that contaminated a large area. No damage was reported at the country's nuclear power facilities after Friday's quake. Radiation levels in fish caught near the area remain high long after the 2011 meltdowns, suggesting contamination from the site might still be seeping into Pacific waters, a U.S. researcher said in October.

"MINNEAPOLIS, Minnesota (CNN)  -- The first caller to reach 911 reported -- in a calm voice that gave no hint to the calamity that awaited -- ""a bridge down over the river."" Hours after Wednesday's collapse, rescuers searched for victims in crumpled cars. Four minutes later, just before 7 p.m. Wednesday, Sgt. Ed Nelson, 55, and two fellow police officers were among the first to arrive at the south side of the Interstate 35W bridge that rose 60 feet above the Mississippi River. ""I don't think anybody quite expected the scene we encountered,"" he said at a news conference featuring first responders. ""It was utter chaos at that time -- bridge smoking, dust in the air. ... We knew it was a bad, very bad situation."" The trio wasted no time. They split up, leaving one officer on the road to direct arriving first responders while Nelson and a fellow officer ditched their gunbelts and their radios and clambered aboard a span of the bridge that had tumbled to the river, carrying a still-undetermined number of vehicles and people with it. With some people still in their cars, some on the fallen bridge span and some in the water, the men sprang into action. ""You forget about everything else,"" said Nelson, a former soldier who has been a police officer for 25 years, 20 of them with the Minneapolis Police Department. ""You understand that you have a job to do and it's time to get down to business and do that job."" The first vehicle they came across was submerged and crushed, he said. ""We asked a man if he saw anybody get out of that vehicle, and he said, 'That was me,' "" Nelson said. As the officers crawled on a beam, the span ""seemed to shift,"" and they could hear rivets popping amid victims' cries for help, Nelson said. ""We were forced to make a decision: Do we stand back and watch, or do we take action?"" he said. ""It's not a place that I would care to go again, but you take a calculated risk and you do your job."" Within a few minutes, fire and rescue officers were helping the men. Three victims with possible back injuries were placed on boards and carried to safety. ""Basically, we just told them to be calm,"" Nelson said. ""A couple of girls were somewhat hysterical. They couldn't understand how they got to that point. I just explained to them that they fell. They seemed somewhat amazed by that fact."" Nelson said he told them, ""It's not the fall that hurts you -- it's the sudden stop at the end. They found that amusing, and it calmed them down."" Only after the police officers had made sure everyone was off the span did the impact of the work hit home. ""When you're doing it, emotion doesn't enter into it,"" Nelson said. ""You understand fully that these people are depending on you, and you have a job to do. And that's what you do."" But, he added, ""12 hours later, you look at the bridge and you go: 'I haven't a clue why I was under that.' "" Much of the rescue work was achieved only after overcoming logistical barriers. About 10 minutes after the collapse, John Hick of the Hennepin County Medical Center was one of the first doctors to arrive at the south side of the wreckage site. But, unable to reach victims from there, he crossed to the north side of the site, where he helped other first responders carry people from the water. The tough terrain on the riverbank made getting ambulances to the victims tough, so the first responders commandeered pickup trucks to ferry 55 victims from the water's edge, Hick said. As Nelson and Hick were toiling, firefighter and diver Shanna Hanson arrived on the north side, where, with just a rope tied around her waist, she dove repeatedly into the water, searching vehicles for possible survivors. Though such work -- swift-water rescue -- can be extremely dangerous, ""you don't think about it much until afterward,"" she said, noting that she focused Wednesday on staying away from live wires and ""widow makers"" -- overhangs that could collapse at any time, killing anyone below. But the work went smoothly, aided by years of having participated in disaster drills, said the diver, who has been a member of the Minneapolis Fire Department since 1991. ""It was not frantic; it was pretty organized."" One of the most difficult parts of the entire operation had nothing to do with rescue work. Instead, it involved breaking the time-honored tradition shared by many firefighters of shunning the public spotlight. ""The media part of it is very difficult for us,"" Hanson told reporters, before ending the news conference abruptly. E-mail to a friend .","Sgt.

"(CNN) -- Matthew Murray, the man who police say shot and killed four people at two separate locations in Colorado on Sunday, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the coroner's office said Tuesday. A former roommate took this photo of Matthew Murray performing in a 2002 Christmas program. ""The death of Matthew Murray has been ruled a suicide,"" the El Paso County Coroner's Office said in a statement. ""It should be noted that he was struck multiple times by the security officer, which put him down. He then fired a single round killing himself,"" the statement said. Police Sgt. Skip Arms told The Associated Press that Murray shot himself in the head. Police say before Murray, 24, went down, he shot and killed sisters Stephanie and Rachael Works, ages 18 and 16, and wounded their father, who was in or near their car in the parking lot of New Life Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Murray also wounded two other people with his assault rifle as he re-entered the church. One of them, Larry Bourbonnais, said he tried to distract the shooter before security guard Jeanne Assam made her move.  Watch Bourbonnais describe the scene at New Life » . ""I'm telling you right now, she's the hero, not me. It was the bravest thing I have ever seen,"" Bourbonnais said. ""She had no cover. He fired -- I heard him fire three. I heard her fire three. And she just began -- she kept yelling 'Surrender!' the whole time. And she just walked forward, like she's walking to her car in the parking lot, firing the whole time."" Bourbonnais said when he and Assam reached Murray, ""he had slumped backwards, slid down on the floor, and expired."" The assault at New Life Church came about 12 hours after Murray shot and killed two people and wounded two others at the Youth With a Mission center in Arvada, Colorado, 80 miles away, police said.  Learn more about the shooting victims » . A memorial service was scheduled for Wednesday for the two staff members there who were killed, Tiffany Johnson, 26, and Philip Crouse, 24, according to the group's co-founder, Peter Warren. Brady Boyd, senior pastor of New Life Church, told reporters Tuesday he and his church had already forgiven Murray, even though he is still angry about what happened. ""But being angry and being unforgiving are two different things,"" Boyd said. On Tuesday a source close to New Life Church, citing financial records, told CNN that Murray's family has contributed various amounts to it over the years. The Rev. Phil Abeyta,  Murray's uncle, joined a prayer session Tuesday night at his church, His Love Fellowship, AP reported. About 70 people prayed for the victims, the Murray family and Matthew Murray. According to AP, Abeyta said the family spent the day ""in reflection and prayer for the families of the victims and those who were injured."" Boyd said his congregation would hold its regular services as scheduled next weekend. Boyd said members will hold a family meeting Wednesday. ""We will gather to worship, pray, mourn and begin our healing process,"" a statement said. ""If we could find some motive, some written motive or some recorded motive that he gave, it would be helpful for the healing process, sure, because that is the question: Why? Why, why, why is going to be the number one question that we answer,"" Boyd said. Some answers may be gleaned from a warning Murray posted online just 90 minutes before he went to New Life Church. The message attributed to Matthew Murray -- using the screen name ""nghtmrchld26"" -- mirrored the wording of a warning posted in 1999 by Eric Harris before he and Dylan Klebold went on a shooting rampage at Columbine High School. ""I'm coming for EVERYONE soon and I WILL be armed to the @.%$ teeth and I WILL shoot to kill,"" the posting obtained by CNN affiliate KUSA-TV read. This was the same wording used by Harris, with the exception of symbols used to replace an expletive. Murray, who lived in Englewood, Colorado, just 13 miles from the Columbine campus, titled his entry ""You Christians brought this on yourselves."" It was published on a Web site for people who had left Pentecostal and fundamentalist religious groups. The message, first reported Monday by KUSA-TV, was taken offline by the site's administrator after he talked to the FBI, but has since been put back online. Joe Istre, president of the Association of Former Pentecostals, said the posts were restored so people could ""try and make sense of all this chaos."" The posting on the online forum, maintained by the group, indicated it was published at 11:03 a.m. on Sunday -- two hours before the shooting at New Life Church and about 11 hours after the shooting at Youth With A Mission. In earlier postings, ""nghtmrchld26"" railed against the Rev. Ted Haggard, founder of New Life Church. Haggard was fired last year after a former male prostitute alleged he had a three-year cash-for-sex relationship with him. Haggard admitted buying methamphetamine from the man but said he didn't use it. In a post from March, Murray complained that because of his mother's concerns about video games and popular music, ""I remember having to listen to everything in secret, at very low volume levels or with headphones, whether it was video games, TV, DVDs, or music/radio."" ""My mother would search EVERYWHERE on a regular basis. You'd have thought I was hiding methamphetamines (which her favorite pastor, Ted Haggard was found guilty of) or something serious, but it was all over DVDs, CDs, and video games,"" Murray wrote.

"(CNN) -- The FBI has launched an investigation into apparent leaks of classified information involving a cyberwarfare program against Iran, a U.S. official said Wednesday. FBI spokesman Paul Bresson had no comment on the reported investigation. Sen. Saxby Chambliss, ranking Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he was informed that an FBI inquiry was under way. The senator from Georgia and other leaders of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees issued a joint statement Tuesday deploring the apparent leaks. ""In recent weeks, we have become increasingly concerned at the continued leaks regarding sensitive intelligence programs and activities, including specific details of sources and methods,"" said Chambliss; Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein, D-California; Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Michigan; and Ranking Member C.A. ""Dutch"" Ruppersberger, D-Maryland, in the statement. ""These disclosures have seriously interfered with ongoing intelligence programs and have put at jeopardy our intelligence capability to act in the future. Each disclosure puts American lives at risk, makes it more difficult to recruit assets, strains the trust of our partners and threatens imminent and irreparable damage to our national security in the face of urgent and rapidly adapting threats worldwide."" The House and Senate Intelligence Committee leaders said they intended ""to review potential legislation to strengthen authorities and procedures with respect to access to classified information and disclosure of it, as well as to ensure that criminal and administrative measures are taken each time sensitive information is improperly disclosed."" ""We also intend to press for the executive branch to take tangible and demonstrable steps to detect and deter intelligence leaks, and to fully, fairly, and impartially investigate the disclosures that have already taken place."" The committee is expected to add leak provisions later this month, when it takes up the FY13 intelligence authorization bill. The plan is for the Senate to vote on the measure before the summer recess. Although the House has already passed a version of the bill without the leak provisions, they would likely be added during a conference with the Senate. Spyware infiltrating Iranian computers . The White House pushed back against suggestions it could be leaking classified information for political purposes. ""This administration takes all appropriate and necessary steps to prevent leaks of classified information or sensitive information that could risk ongoing counterterrorism or intelligence operations,"" spokesman Jay Carney said Wednesday aboard Air Force One as the president traveled to campaign events on the West Coast. ""Any suggestion that this administration has authorized intentional leaks of classified information for political gain is grossly irresponsible."" Asked about the White House's response, Sen. John McCain told CNN International's ""Amanpour,"" ""I would expect nothing else from the White House. But the fact is that the portrayal of the president in these stories is nothing short of heroic."" The ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee added, ""Clearly, administration officials were involved."" McCain, R-Arizona, said he has ""great faith"" in the FBI but that a matter as weighty as national security ""probably deserves a special counsel."" He continued, ""It's clear that the Iranians will profit from having this information. In fact, they might even feel they are justified in cybercounterattacks."" Feinstein told CNN's ""The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer"" that she didn't believe any of the information came from the top ranks of the White House. ""I think one of the problems is, information is not closely held sufficiently,"" she said. She described policies regarding responding to leaks as ""archaic"" and said they need to be revamped. The government's failure to keep its secrets has dissuaded some people from giving information to the United States and has endangered lives, she said, but she is unaware of anyone having been killed as a result. She would not go into specifics. ""People just talk too much,"" she said. ""This didn't used to be the case. But suddenly it's like it's a spreadable disease."" John Kerry, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, expressed confidence Wednesday that the White House played no role in the apparent leaks. ""I know that people at the White House were not involved,"" he said. He disputed McCain's assertion to the contrary. ""McCain needs to know, before people make that kind of accusation, the reporters themselves have said it did not come from anybody on the Obama team or on the Democratic side or anything like that,"" Kerry said. ""I take that at face value."" But he said such a leak ""endangers our long-term security."" A report in The New York Times on Friday provided classified details of what it described as a U.S cyberattack targeting Iran's nuclear centrifuge program. Since shortly after he became president, Barack Obama has ordered cyberattacks targeting computers that run Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities, the report said, attributing the information to participants in the program. The White House has said it did not authorize any leak of such information. McCain said Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin has agreed to hold a hearing on the matter. Some Republicans, including McCain, have called for a special prosecutor to investigate. But Deputy Attorney General James Cole, in response to a question from Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said Wednesday that he does not believe a special prosecutor is needed in this case. Chambliss said he expects the FBI to conduct a ""full and fair investigation, including a review of administration officials who have been quoted anonymously or directly."" Feinstein said she had discussed the possibility of a joint hearing with Levin. On Tuesday, White House deputy press secretary Josh Earnest said the administration believes that classified information should remain secret for a reason, and ""publicizing it would pose a threat to our national security."" McCain and Chambliss cited other recent leaks as well, including information on the administration's efforts to expand its drone program and the president's involvement in ""kill lists"" against militants in Yemen and Pakistan. Also, the public airing of details surrounding a recently disrupted bomb plot in Yemen by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula angered intelligence and national security officials.

"Mafraq, Jordan (CNN) -- There are so many refugees living in one neighborhood here that locals have started calling it Syria Town. In Syria Town's dusty streets, children peer out from storefronts and shop windows partially covered by blankets, sheets and cardboard. Refugees are renting out shops that once sold sweets and converting them into makeshift homes. Some of these converted residences don't have doors. A blanket hung over the entryway of Um Khaled's one-room home. The widow from the Syrian city of Homs spent her last savings renting what used to be an office. ""The regime soldiers and Shabiha militia took my husband and son from our house. They also took my brother and his son. They lined them up on the street and shot them,"" she said. Um Khaled's surviving sons, Abdul Kareem and Abdul Rahman, sat beside her on the floor. The eyes of the boys, ages 11 and 12, looked glazed and empty. Before the war, both boys went to school in Syria. Rahman wanted to become a lawyer. Now refugees in a foreign country, both boys have been looking for jobs to help pay the rent. ""There is no work, the children can't work, so life is hard,"" Um Khaled said. Competing for scarce resources . The trouble is, there weren't enough jobs to go around even before Syrian refugees start flooding into Jordan. Jordan had an unofficial unemployment rate of 30% in 2012, according to the CIA World Fact Book. But today, this small kingdom of roughly 6.5 million inhabitants hosts more than 450,000 registered Syrian refugees. Hundreds of thousands of additional Syrians are believed to be living in Jordan outside the formal refugee system. Increasingly, Jordanians are competing with Syrians for jobs, real estate and even dwindling supplies of water. ""In a time where you have a very high rate of unemployment, where Jordanians are feeling economical hardship, this is making people angry,"" said Randa Habib, a political analyst and the author of the book ""Hussein and Abdullah: Inside the Jordanian Royal Family."" The mounting frustration was palpable on the streets of Mafraq, a scruffy Jordanian border town, where Jordanians and Syrians approached visiting foreigners begging for money. ""The situation was already tough, and it's gotten harder since the Syrians came here,"" said Khalid Mohamed el Wali, a car mechanic dressed in grease-spattered clothes. ""Despite hardships in the past, we never had to line up for bread before, but since the Syrians came here, we have started lining up and waiting in bread lines."" Anger has boiled over . ""Of course people are angry,"" restaurant owner Awwad Zudi said as he sliced chunks of beef with a knife for the sizzling grill behind him. ""There have been water cuts, an increase in property prices and rent. Jordanian property owners have started finding legal ways to evict Jordanian tenants so they can rent their property to Syrians for double the price or to make Jordanians pay higher prices,"" Zudi added. Frequently, Jordanians also have complained about the enormous government-run Zaatari refugee camp outside Mafraq. As the population there has swelled to more than 100,000 residents, Jordanian security forces have struggled to maintain order. Last week, rioting residents torched dozens of tents after clashes reportedly erupted with protesting residents of a neighboring Jordanian town. The refugee population will be one of the top items on the agenda Friday when U.S. President Barack Obama sits down with Jordan's King Abdullah in Amman. According to the United Nations, international donors have pledged only about a fifth of the funds needed to help Syrian refugees in Jordan. Wealthy expatriate donors . This month, a group of wealthy Syrian expatriate businessmen who oppose the government in Damascus opened a new aid program in Jordan aimed at helping Syrian refugees. At a warehouse where workers from the Syrian Business Council for Relief and Development loaded sacks of rice into trucks for distribution to refugees, council members handed out rice to Jordanians gathered around the vehicles. ""We know well about the Jordanian economic situation. So we need to help them and to help us,"" said Dr. Khaled al Mahameed, the council's vice president. Last week, artillery rumbled in the distance as Mahameed and his colleagues prepared to distribute clothes and shoes to refugees in the Jordanian border town of Ramtha. Mahameed's hometown of Daraa was just across the border. ""You can walk to my house from here,"" Mahameed said, pointing to the nearby customs terminal leading to Syria. ""But you know the situation. The regime tanks block the border, and you cannot pass."" Later, the Syrian businessmen posed for cameras as they handed out coats to smiling children. But the new clothes did nothing to stop a 2-year-old Syrian girl named Dareen from crying hysterically. Her legs were bound in casts after a bomb broke them two and a half months ago. Dareen is another innocent victim of the brutal conflict next door in Syria. The little girl also was a reminder that until the fighting stops, the future looks bleak for residents of the growing refugee community in Syria Town.

"(CNN) -- Americans set a record for number of votes cast in this presidential election but failed to make history with the percentage of voter turnout, experts said. A record 2.9 million voters cast ballots Tuesday in Missouri. Curtis Gans, director of American University's Center for the Study of the American Electorate, said Thursday that percentage turnout was lower because Republicans stayed away from the polls. Disappointment over Sen. John McCain's choice of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate, combined with a perception that the ticket would lose, prompted many would-be Republican voters to ditch the polls on Election Day, Gans said. ""There was real hostility ... amongst moderate Republicans"" that McCain would choose the conservative governor, Gans said. ""And then there was a gradual perception that the party was going to get whomped."" Nevertheless, between 126.5 million and 128.5 million Americans cast ballots this year, according to a report by the electorate study center. Successful Democratic get-out-the-vote initiatives contributed to that number, which shattered 2004's mark of 122.2 million. The report surveyed 47 states and the nation's capital. Twenty-two of those states and the District of Columbia reported an increase in voter turnout this year, the center said. GOP turnout increased in only eight of the surveyed states, according to the report. The percentage of registered voters casting ballots this year is projected at 60.7 to 61.7 percent, according to the center -- a figure much lower than the modern-day record set in 1960 -- 67 percent. Democrat Barack Obama's campaign is credited with building a sophisticated organization at local levels in key states that energized voters to register and to stand for hours in line to cast early ballots. Nationwide, early votes totaled at least 31.7 million in at least 30 early voting states, said Michael McDonald, a professor at George Mason University. McDonald, who also produced projections of voter turnout, estimated Friday that 130.9 million ballots were cast by 61.5 percent of Americans who were eligible to vote. The final tally is expected to be counted by early December, he said. Gans said many people believed this election's turnout would shatter the 2004 mark because of the high amount of early voters, including African-Americans and younger voters, who historically vote in lower numbers. ""We failed to realize that the registration increase was driven by Democratic and independent registration and that the long lines at the polls were mostly populated by Democrats,"" he said. Voter registration increased this year by more than 10 million people, Gans said.  See percentage of voting-age population that voted on Election Day 2004, 2008 » . Absentee ballots tend to flow in at the last minute, McDonald said. But this year, with so many people participating in early and absentee voting ahead of the election, there may not be a large flood of absentee ballots, he said. He said Friday that turnout rates rose in states that became battlegrounds in this election. On the other hand, he said, voter turnout in states that lost battleground status was lower or held steady, compared with 2004. Battleground state North Carolina's turnout rate had the largest increase from 2004, according to the center. The state reported a 69 percent turnout rate -- up from 56.8 percent in 2004, according to center data. Missouri, another battleground, reported a record number of voters on Tuesday: 2.9 million. But its turnout percentage -- 69.4 percent -- failed to make history. In Maine, the secretary of state's office projected a record-setting 80 percent turnout among registered voters, which would break Maine's previous record of 74 percent in 2004. Georgia, which saw a 61.3 percent turnout, up from 54.7 percent in 2004, also had a record high turnout, according to data from the center. In 1908 -- when the voter pool was much smaller because African-Americans and women were denied the vote -- 65.7 percent cast ballots in the race between William Howard Taft and William Jennings Bryan. Towering above this year's turnout was the historic race of 1860, when Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas faced off, attracting 81.3 percent. CNN's Debra Alban contributed to this report.","Report: About 127 million votes cast, shattering 2004 record .

"(CNN) -- Sharifa lost her foot when the Syrian jets swooped down and fired missiles at the house. Now the hijab-clad girl sits jaded in a dirty, hardscrabble displaced persons camp near Turkey, growing up fast, confused and far from home. CNN special coverage: Syria's refugees . She needs crutches to move around and weeps for her lost limb. ""I can't get it back,"" she said. But like many youth, Sharifa is resilient. She teaches the younger kids at the camp mosque and, inshallah, wants to go back to her home village and do it there. Her life has been hijacked. She's consumed by hope and grief, determination and despair. ""I just want to walk again,"" she says. ""I just want to walk."" Watch more of Sharifa's story . Sharifa is one of a lost generation uprooted by Syria's civil war. She's one of the casualties of what the International Rescue Committee is calling a ""regional humanitarian disaster,"" the widespread displacement caused by nearly two years of civil strife and war in Syria. The IRC, one of the world's major refugee agencies, issued a chilling report Monday about the plight of refugees and internally displaced people. More than 2.5 million Syrians have been uprooted, the IRC says. Of those who have had to leave their homes, about 600,000 have fled, mostly to Jordan, Turkey, Lebanon and Iraq, which border Syria. It's a replay of the population flight out of war-torn Iraq last decade. It conjures the wrenching flight in the 1940s during the birth of Israel, also next door to Syria. ""The Middle East is once again facing a human displacement tragedy,"" the IRC's commission on Syrian refugees said. The IRC interviewed refugees in the border nations and got a grim view of life in the country. Killings, attacks, arbitrary arrests, torture, abductions, rape, bombings and sexual violence. Loss of infrastructure and health care. Dwindling supplies of food, water and electricity. No school. More: Children scavenge for food . More than 60,000 people have died since the regime of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad cracked down on peaceful protesters, a stance that set in motion what has become a nightmare, a civil war between the unyielding government and tenacious rebels. The fighting has taken a sectarian overtone. The government is dominated by Alawites. The opposition, largely by Sunni Muslims. People from other groups and religions in the diverse country have been caught in the crossfire. Some have joined the rebels. Others support the government. Many sit tight and hope it ends. Others have fled to higher ground in Syria. Some to other countries. People have embarked on treacherous journeys to safety outside Syria, scurrying from Homs and Hama to Lebanon, Daraa to Jordan, Aleppo and Idlib to Turkey, and Syrian Kurdish neighborhoods to Iraq. Many live in camps, but most are ""urban refugees,"" scattered through villages, towns and cities seeking shelter anywhere it is available. Some live with host families but others are packed into small, dingy and poorly maintained apartments. Some are squatters, staying put in schools, public buildings and unused spaces. ""Every time it rains, we live in a pool of mud,"" said a 60-year-old woman from Daraa, interviewed by the IRC. She and seven others in Jordan share a room with a dirt floor and leaky roof. Women and girls have gone from the frying pan to the fire. Rape is a main reason why many refugees fled, but there is ""an alarming lack of medical and counseling services"" in their new homes, the report said. ""They face unsafe conditions in camps and elevated levels of domestic violence, while reports of early and /or forced marriage of women and girls are increasing,"" the report said. Children are traumatized. ""Abuse, neglect and exploitation"" are risks that are right around the corner. In Turkey, 8-year-old refugee children make drawings, just like kids everywhere. The images? Scenes from home of bombs and terror. ""Many teachers in host schools are ill-equipped to assist traumatized children -- as are their parents. Many children exhibit violent aggressive behavior,"" the report said, citing an IRC counselor in Jordan. ""Others have stopped eating, talking and sleeping."" More: Life in the camps . The IRC is telling the world it urgently needs solutions. Humanitarian aid must be increased. Borders must remain open. More assistance is needed for internally displaced Syrians. Urban refugees need more attention, and women and girls need better protection. The world also must prepare for fallout and instability, even if the al-Assad government is toppled. ""The international community must quickly plan for a displacement crisis that could last well beyond the end of the Assad government and persist regardless of the political outcome of the conflict,"" the report said. Now winter is here. Aid agencies are bracing for more misery. One refugee in Lebanon said his family has spent the year living in a sheep shed. Now they face the punishment of winter: winds, cold, rain and snow. Even flooding. ""I cry in my heart. I feel depressed. It's unjust,"" he said. ""Is there a worse way to live than this?"" In a camp near Turkey, Abdul Qadr al-Hasan's daughter, Siham, succumbed amid the frigid air. More: What's next for Syria? ""She was not sick. She didn't have any problems at all. We were up late that night and we were playing with her,"" al-Hasan said, speaking in a tent. ""We woke up the next morning, her mother checked on her. She was curled into a ball from the cold."" Also near Turkey, Sharifa struggles on. More: How it all started . She says it is ""God's will this happened."" ""The situation is hard here, nobody can bear this."" Sharifa may be a limping casualty of war, but she and other young traumatized Syrians -- living in tents, crammed in apartments and hiding in villages and towns -- are now the country's future. They will limp home after the war ends to rebuild their land. ""I don't want to play again,"" she said. ""I just want to walk.""

"Washington (CNN) -- They've become a linchpin of projecting U.S. military power into war zones around the world. But now those same unmanned aerial vehicles have been infected by a computer virus, according to a U.S defense official. The drones are still flying missions in places like Afghanistan and Iraq, where as many as 150 of them can be in involved in various surveillance missions each day. The official says the virus infected the classified military computer systems that control the drones, but it has not ""stopped the drones from flying worldwide."" ""Military officials are more concerned than panicked by this virus,"" said Danger Room Editor Noah Schactman, who first reported the story last week for Wired magazine. ""They're just really not sure what's going on. They're not sure if it's a deliberate attack. They're not sure if it's something accidental."" The drones fly all over the world, but they are remote-piloted from American soil by pilots at Creech Air Force Base in Nevada. That's where the virus was first detected. The virus is logging each keystroke that the remote pilots input, and officials are trying to determine whether any classified information is actually being lost or sent outside the network. Schactman says the military has had a hard time wiping out the virus. ""They've tried over and over again to get rid of this thing using some fairly conventional methods, and they haven't worked. And so it seems the only thing to get rid of this virus is to basically wipe the hard drives of these computers entirely and sort of rebuild the computers from scratch,"" Schactman said. But that can be an exhausting process: In 2008 removable hard drives introduced a virus into thousands of Defense Department computers, and to this day the Pentagon is still purging some machines. In the case of the computers that help coordinate the drones, care also has to be taken to back up all the information, so it isn't lost during rebuilding. The UAVs have become indispensable for military planners who depend on constant combat air patrols. But current and former Pentagon officials admit that technology cuts both ways. At the confirmation hearing for Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, former Deputy Defense Secretary William Lynn said bluntly, ""In the 21st century, bits and bytes can be as threatening as bullets and bombs."" Lynn says even the National Defense University has been breached, and in a single intrusion this year 24,000 files were taken from a defense company. He says these are just some examples of a number of cyber intrusions over the past several years. In June Lynn testified that ""Some of the stolen data is mundane, like the specifications for small parts of tanks, airplanes and submarines. But a great deal of it concerns our most sensitive systems, including avionics, surveillance technologies, satellite communications systems and network security protocols. The cyber exploitation being perpetrated against the defense industry cuts across a wide swath of crucial military hardware, extending from missile tracking systems and satellite navigation devices to UAVs and the Joint Strike Fighter."" Perhaps most alarming, Lynn admitted that up till now, the US military had not been able to secure its systems. ""Current countermeasures have not stopped this outflow of sensitive information,"" Lynn said. ""We need to do more to guard our digital storehouses of design innovation."" Officials have not determined whether the virus introduced into the drone program is benign, or doing actual harm. An investigation is ongoing. Despite the fact the controls are not linked into any outside network, and therefore seemingly impervious to intrusion, the drone systems do have security issues. Noah Schactman says they still use external hard drives, and when they're attached to the top-secret computers it can open them up to infection. He says the true danger of this virus comes not from an ability to ""bring down a drone,"" which is unlikely. Schactman says it comes down to trust. And he surmises that if officials come to think that the data they're receiving from the unmanned vehicles has been compromised, they're much less likely to view the information as safe and valuable. Perhaps most alarming: the worst is yet to come. Even top Pentagon officials admit that more destructive tools are being developed, cyber weapons that have not yet been used. Former Deputy Secretary Lynn says, ""And the most malicious actors have not yet obtained the most harmful capabilities. But this situation will not hold forever. There will eventually be a marriage of capability and intent, where those who mean us harm will gain the ability to launch damaging cyber attacks. We need to develop stronger defenses before this occurs."" In August, a drone attack killed al Qaeda No. 2 Atiya Abdul Rahman in Pakistan. The most recent high-profile drone strike resulted in the death of U.S.-born militant cleric Anwar al-Awlaki in Yemen last month.","The virus has not ""stopped flights worldwide,"" defense official says .
The infection was first reported by Wired.com .

"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- Spain will send up to 395 troops to combat piracy off the coast of Somalia as part of a European Union task force, the Spanish Parliament agreed on Wednesday. A soldier looks at a Yemeni fishing boat from a French frigate. Spanish troops are due to join the EU task force. The near-unanimous parliamentary vote authorizing the troop deployment came after a Spanish tuna fishing boat was seized last spring by Somali pirates and later released, after a reported payment of ransom. Last November, a Spanish press photographer was kidnapped in Somalia, while working on a story about piracy. He was released two weeks ago. Spanish Defense Minister Carme Chacon told parliament before the vote that the fight against piracy ""is of vital importance for the defense of the geostrategic and economic interests of Spain, and will provide security to our fishing fleet,"" according to a defense ministry statement. Spain already has a P-3 maritime surveillance plane with 70 troops at a French air base in Djibouti, just north of Somalia, and those assets will now go toward the EU task force against piracy, involving various EU nations. In addition, Spain will send a frigate with a helicopter and 196 troops, and later a supply ship with a helicopter and 118 more troops. Spain is due to take the rotating command of the EU task force next April, when Spanish fishing boats work off of Somalia, the ministry statement said. The cost to Spain's treasury will be €3.7 million to €5.1 million ($4.7 million to $6.5 million) per month, depending on the assets deployed.","Spain to send 395 troops to join EU task force fighting piracy off Somali coast .

"Washington (CNN) -- So just why is 1999 suddenly such a flashpoint in Campaign 2012? Team Obama says 1999 is the birth year of ""The Big Bain Lie"" and goes on to suggest that Mitt Romney might have committed a felony. That provoked a rare statement from Romney campaign manager Matt Rhoades, who called on President Barack Obama to apologize for ""the out of control behavior of his staff, which demeans the office that he holds."" Pointed rhetoric aside, just what is the 1999 debate about and why is it potentially significant in the Obama versus Romney race? Fortune: Documents -- Romney didn't manage Bain funds . At issue is whether Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, is telling the truth when he says he had no role in investment and operations decisions at Bain Capital once he left in February 1999 to take over the Salt Lake City Olympic Games. Talking Points Memo this week questioned Romney's claim by citing Securities and Exchange Commission filings listing Romney as Bain's top officer after 1999. The Boston Globe on Thursday carried a similar account -- and that was seized upon by Team Obama. ""Either Mitt Romney, through his own words and his own signature, was misrepresenting his position at Bain to the SEC, which is a felony, or he was misrepresenting his position at Bain to the American people to avoid responsibility for some of the consequences of his investments,"" Stephanie Cutter, deputy Obama campaign manager, said on a campaign conference call. Remember that last part of Cutter's statement -- about responsibility for ""his"" investments. But first, is there anything other than the SEC filings to suggest a hands-on Romney role at Bain post-February 1999? No is the word from four sources who communicated with CNN on Thursday -- all of whom have firsthand knowledge of Bain's operations at the time in question. Three of the four are Democrats, and two of the four are active Obama supporters in Campaign 2012. All four told me Romney is telling the truth. Only one, Bain Managing Director Steve Pagliuca, would talk on the record. The others spoke only on condition of anonymity, citing either Bain's low-key culture or the desire not to anger friends in the Obama campaign. Pagliuca, a Democrat who unsuccessfully ran for Senate in 2010, told CNN: ""Mitt Romney left Bain Capital in February 1999 to run the Olympics and has had absolutely no involvement with the management or investment activities of the firm or with any of its portfolio companies since the day of his departure."" In explaining the SEC documents filed in 2000 and 2001, Pagliuca said, ""Due to the sudden nature of Mr. Romney's departure, he remained the sole stockholder for a time while formal ownership was being documented and transferred to the group of partners who took over management of the firm in 1999. Accordingly, Mr. Romney was reported in various capacities on SEC filings during this period."" Another Bain Democrat who did not want to be identified by name said Romney had no role after taking the Olympics post . ""Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. He was just gone. And it happened very suddenly. ... After that, he was not on calls or writing memos. He was gone."" To be clear, all four of the sources voiced professional loyalty and personal respect for Romney. And all four have a vested interest in defending the work of Bain. But they were consistent in describing Romney's departure as abrupt and in saying they could not recall him around the office in the months that followed. Two highly reputable arbiters of political debate -- The Washington Post's fact-checking arm and FactCheck.org -- also on Thursday stood by their earlier findings that Romney stepped away from any active role at Bain when he accepted the Olympics post. And Fortune reported that it obtained private Bain documents that support the Romney account. But the Obama campaign and its liberal allies continue to hang their claim on the SEC filings. Why so important for them to try to stretch the calendar of Romney's Bain tenure? For starters, just suggesting Romney isn't telling the truth fits the arc of recent Obama character attacks on the Republican hopeful, including questions about why he won't release more of his tax records. More significant, though, is that Cutter statement about responsibility for ""his"" investments. Liberal blogs were quick to list Bain-tied companies that lost jobs in late 1999 and beyond -- and just as quick to suggest it is now fair game to blame Romney. And inside both Bain and the Romney campaign, there is a strong belief that either the Obama campaign or a Democratic ally wants to use another Bain investment against Romney late in the campaign but cannot do so with any credibility under the February 1999 departure scenario. The investment in question: Stericycle, a medical waste company that, among other things, disposed of aborted fetuses. How could the Stericycle investment be used against Romney? Bain's involvement in a company that disposed of aborted fetuses could make a powerful final week direct mail piece or attack ad on Christian radio. And in a close election, turnout of the religious right is one of the keys to a Romney victory in November. Bain negotiated the Stericyle investment deal in November 1999, nine months after Romney said he left. Bain's investors pour money into numbered investment pools. Several sources said that Fund VII was the main investment vehicle at that time. ""You don't see his name anywhere -- in the meetings list, the investor documents, the manager paperwork -- it would have to be there if he was involved in any way,"" one current Bain officer said of Romney and Fund VII. ""He was long gone then.""","Obama campaign says Romney lying about involvement with Bain after he left .

"(CNN) -- Nearly a quarter of all students who try to join the U.S. Army can't pass the entrance exam, a new study says. The study, ""Shut Out of the Military: Today's High School Education Doesn't Mean You're Ready for Today's Army,"" puts the blame on America's educational system. ""This is true for men and women of all races and ethnicities, but especially for young people of color,"" according to the study released Tuesday by the Education Trust. ""That's because they don't have the reading, mathematics, science and problem-solving abilities that it takes to pass the enlistment exam, which is designed specifically to identify the skills and knowledge needed to be a good soldier."" The study's results show disparities between ethnic groups. ""Among white test-takers, 16% scored below the minimum score required by the Army. For Hispanic candidates, the rate of ineligibility was 29%. And for African-American youth, it was 39%,"" the study says. Recruits must score at least a 31 on the test to meet minimum eligibility requirements. Higher scores can qualify recruits for enlistment bonuses and advanced training. ""In every state in America, the military turns away remarkably high percentages of applicants who, despite their high school diplomas, lack the reading, math, science and problem-solving skills needed to serve in the armed forces,"" the study says. The United States regularly scores in the middle of the pack in educational achievement. The results of a global education survey this month showed U.S. high school students come in 26th out of 65 in combined scores for math, science and reading tests, according to the Organization for European Economic Cooperation's Program for International Assessment. Eight out of the top 10 entries are from the Asia-Pacific region, including the Chinese cities of Shanghai and Hong Kong as well as Singapore, South Korea and Japan. The Education Trust said the results of the Army's Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery test are indicative how America's education system prepares students for the civilian workplace as well. ""Because the (Army test) specifically assesses readiness in a wide range of vocational pathways, it's equally likely that the men and women who don't pass the test are unprepared for the civilian workforce.""","Study: Army test results are indicative of how U.S. education system prepares students .

"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN)  -- President Robert Mugabe was sworn in Sunday after the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission declared he overwhelmingly won the country's disputed runoff election. ""I, Robert Gabriel Mugabe, do swear that I will well and truly serve Zimbabwe in the office of president, so help me God,"" Mugabe said at the State House complex in Harare, standing  before a red-robed judge wearing a white wig. His words were met with loud applause. The international community has roundly called the election -- allegedly marred by violence and vote rigging -- a ""sham."" Many voters expressed fear of government retaliation if they did not take part in the vote to extend Mugabe's rule. Some said they were required to report the serial numbers on their ballots to Mugabe's Zimbabwe African National Union -- Patriotic Front.  Watch as Mugabe gets sworn in » . Zimbabwe's Electoral Commission released the final results of Friday's runoff vote, showing that Mugabe won by an almost 9-to-1 margin, with voter turnout about 42 percent. The final tally, according to the electoral commission, showed Mugabe snaring 2.2 million votes, or about 86 percent of the ballots, to opposition candidate Morgan Tsvangirai's 233,000. The commission's quick turnaround was a contrast to the five weeks it took the ZEC to release results from the March 29 election. Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change quickly denounced the results, calling the election ""a one-man race, a one-man circus."" ""We have nothing to do with the so-called Mugabe win,"" MDC spokesman Nelson Chamisa ""In effect we believe that whatever ZANU-PF and Mugabe are doing is just but a continuation of the sham."" He added, ""We do not in any way associate ourselves with the so-called win."" A government official confirmed earlier Sunday that invitations had been sent out for Mugabe's inauguration, but said the ceremony would not be held until official results were announced and a winner declared. A Zimbabwean journalist said there was activity at the presidential residence Saturday night. Tents were erected and trucks drove in and out of the property, leading reporters to speculate that a swearing-in ceremony was in the works. Tsvangirai was among those invited to the ceremony, but he would not attend, Chamisa said before the ceremony. ""How do you invite a man to a false wedding?"" he asked. Mugabe was the sole candidate in the runoff. Tsvangirai pulled out last week, citing violence and intimidation, but the government said it was too late to remove his name from the ballots. Before the results were official, Mugabe said he won in all parts of the capital city of Harare and many parts elsewhere. Though there were reports Friday of low voter turnout, the state-run newspaper lauded record turnout, and Mugabe said he did not know what prompted people to vote in such overwhelming numbers. Mugabe made the claims Sunday at a funeral for his wife's relative. It was broadcast on state television. ""Turnout was very low,"" Irene Petras, executive director of Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights, said Sunday. ""A lot of people [were] dragged to the polling station to fill out a ballot paper."" The MDC reported that ZANU-PF supporters herded rural voters to the polls and forced them to vote. The party said about 90 of its supporters have been killed in the weeks preceding the election. Zimbabwean Deputy Minister of Information Bright Matonga said he would not ""dignify the charges with comment"" and declared the voting process peaceful. He also said MDC supporters burned down some polling stations. Members of the Pan-African Parliament observer mission, however, said the election was not ""free, fair and credible."" ""The environment was tense, hostile and volatile,"" said Marwick Khumalo, a lawmaker from Swaziland. ""And there was a high level of intimidation, violence, displacement of people, abduction and loss of lives."" The mission said opposition parties were not allowed to hold rallies and were shut out from broadcasting their campaign messages on state-run media. ""There was hate speech, incitement of violence and war rhetoric that instilled fear and trepidation amongst voters,"" Khumalo said. Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga called on the African Union to send troops to Zimbabwe, saying the ongoing crisis in the country is a ""shame and embarrassment."" Odinga, a former opposition leader who became Kenya's prime minister after a power-sharing deal following a disputed election in that country, made the comments during a visit to his home province. He made a similar appeal earlier this month. ""The information that we have right now is that Mugabe is proceeding with impunity, completely disregarding the world opinion,"" he said. ""And I have suggested that the United Nations should support the African Union and come up with a peacekeeping force that will be deployed in Zimbabwe so that some calmer decisions can be facilitated."" Opposition leaders and international observers have called the election a ""sham"" -- a word that President Bush also used to denounce the voting. Tsvangirai supporters say he defeated Zimbabwe's longtime leader in the March elections. But when the results were reported, the Mugabe-appointed commission said Tsvangirai had not won by enough to avoid a runoff. Mugabe has been the country's only leader since it gained its independence from Britain in 1980. Tsvangirai remained holed up for a sixth day Saturday at the Dutch Embassy in Harare, Chamisa said. Tsvangirai fled to the embassy last week, saying he feared for his safety. Matonga on Saturday said that the government would be willing to sit down with Tsvangirai and MDC members ""as long as they are not pushing the British agenda or an American agenda."" Mugabe has called the MDC a creation of the West. However, Tendai Biti, MDC secretary-general, said Saturday that the runoff had closed some doors in the eyes of the MDC. ""A government of national unity, as far as we're concerned, is history,"" he said, saying that some sort of transitional arrangement might be possible.","NEW: Mugabe swears to ""truly serve Zimbabwe ... so help me God""

"(CNN) -- A former U.S. Senate candidate from Tennessee was arrested after allegedly trying to hire a hit man to kill his uncle, CNN affiliate WJHL reports. Thomas Ken Owens offered a man $500 as a down payment to kill the relative, who is a pastor and bailiff the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said. WJHL identified Owens as a one-time Senate candidate. A message left by CNN at Owens' residence was not immediately returned. It was not immediately clear whether he has an attorney. According to court documents, posted online by the Johnson City Press, Owens met up Friday evening with someone who he thought was a hit man in the parking lot of a sports bar, and provided the photo and address of his uncle, Ernest ""Ernie"" Widby. He didn't realize that the purported hit man was an informant. Owens was arrested after the meeting, which was audio recorded. Owens, 38, has been charged with solicitation to commit first degree murder. There was a spiritual dispute within the family, WJHL reported. Widby is the founder and pastor of the local church, New Zion Faith Center, and a bailiff with the Carter County Sheriff's Office. At a press conference, Carter County Sheriff Chris Mathes called Owens a ""disturbed individual."" ""I'll be very public about this. You're not going to threaten one of my officers,"" Mathes said. Widby didn't take time off work. He attended the press conference but did not comment, WJHL-TV reported. ""I will tell you that Mr. Widby is one of the finest men I've met in my life,"" Mathes said. Government records show that a Thomas Ken Owens threw his name into the ring for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate in 2012. WJHL said he also worked as a reporter for the station between 2001 and 2004. He is being held at the Washington County Jail on a $100,000 bond, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said.

"(CNN) -- The renewed bloodshed and defiant protests in Egypt prompts a provocative question: Could Egypt really collapse? Just two years into a revolution that ignited during the Arab Spring, Egypt's defense minister warned this week the raging conflict ""may lead to the collapse of the state and threaten the future of our coming generations."" On Wednesday, analysts described that statement as overreaching, but none dismissed the severity of the country's problems. ""His comments were a bit over the top,"" said Joshua Stacher, a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center of Scholars. ""It depends on what your definition of what 'collapse' is,"" added Steven A. Cook, senior fellow for Middle Eastern studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""The economy is certainly in terrible shape."" James Coyle, director of global education at Chapman University in California, said the comment by Defense Minister Gen. Abdul Fattah al-Sisi was ""a bit of an overreaction."" ""But five days of riots and tens of deaths and thousands of demonstrators still in Tahrir Square two years after the fall of (Hosni) Mubarak, I can understand why he would say it."" Analysts agreed that the remarks should serve as an alarm. ""It was a warning to everybody -- the opposition, the Brotherhood -- that they've got to get their act together,"" said CNN correspondent Ben Wedeman in Cairo. He was referring to the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist party to which President Mohamed Morsy belongs. The military -- the powerful bulwark for Egyptian secularism that temporarily governed the country after the revolution ousted longtime ruler Mubarak -- is worried about civil war. ""This is a telegraphed message to everybody that this is getting out of control,"" Wedeman said. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also addressed the defense minister's warning of a collapse. ""I hope not,"" she told CNN Tuesday. ""That would lead to incredible chaos and violence on a scale that would be devastating for Egypt and the region."" Morsy's government needs to understand that the revolution's aspirations ""have to be taken seriously"" and that ""the rule of law applied to everyone,"" she said. ""It's very difficult going from a closed regime -- essentially one-man rule -- to a democracy that is trying to be born and learn to walk,"" Clinton explained. ""I think the messages and the actions coming from the leadership have to be changed in order to give people confidence that they are on the right path to the kind of future they seek."" Exacerbating the political crisis is Egypt's woeful economy, where the lifeblood of tourism is all but dead and the currency is devalued, analysts said. Recent demonstrations in Port Said and nearby cities along the Suez Canal are symbolic because that region was among the first where the Mubarak regime lost control during the 2011 unrest leading to revolution, analysts said. The region has long felt distant from Cairo. Demonstrators this week ignored the curfew Morsy imposed on the region following bloodshed on the second anniversary of the revolution last Friday. Protesters fed up with slow change clashed with authorities, leaving seven people dead. Rage exploded again when a judge sentenced to death 21 residents of Port Said for their roles in a deadly soccer riot last year. At least 38 people were killed in the two days of violence after the verdict. The defense minister denied reports that the army used live ammunition on the protesters, state-run media said. ""What struck me this time was the call for emergency law and emergency measures, and it was just ignored,"" Cook said. ""The people in Port Said were demonstrating and just thumbed their nose at the government."" Protesters behind the Egyptian revolution now feel betrayed, particularly as the state security agency was changed in name only to homeland security, Stacher said. No one from Mubarak's coercive security apparatus was sentenced for any violence during the revolutionary rallies, he said. Protesters now just throw rocks at police during most encounters, he added. ""This all boils down to something very basic,"" Stacher said. ""The people demanded real change in Egypt but were lied to and their wishes were postponed and they were told they weren't important. ""And the generals went around and created this exclusivist coalition (with Morsy's government), which is what people were protesting against in the first place,"" Stacher said. In fact, protesters began calling Morsy ""Morsilini,"" a reference to the late Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini who was Adolf Hitler's ally. That nickname arose after Morsy gave himself sweeping powers in November. Morsy later canceled most of those powers following demonstrations. That turn of events hurt Morsy's image because he was enjoying international attention for playing a constructive role in the recent, bloody conflict in Gaza between Hamas and Israeli forces, analysts said. The stakes are high for a country strategically positioned in Middle Eastern politics and in world trade through the Suez Canal. ""I don't think the international community can afford for (Egypt) to collapse economically ... or politically,"" Cook said. The defense minister's warning is ""very important"" because ""it shows the military has been in consultation about this. That's why I take it more seriously,"" Cook added. In the coming month, Egyptians will go to the polls to elect a lower house in Parliament. The election will be a bellwether on how Morsy's Muslim Brotherhood now stands against the opposition coalition National Salvation Front, analysts said. ""They are smart people,"" Stacher said of opposition leaders, ""but the problem is that they don't seem like they want to have a real democracy either."" For now, the Egyptian military doesn't appear to want to intervene and run the Egyptian government again as another president is selected. ""If the situation deteriorates further, the military might not have a choice and it might find a warm reception,"" Cook wrote on his blog for the Council on Foreign Relations. In a revolution, the first government typically doesn't stay in power, as seen in the Russian and French revolutions, Coyle explained. ""Usually it gets replaced by more radical elements of society,"" he said. CNN's Adam Makary contributed to this report from Port Said, Egypt .","Egypt's raging conflict ""may lead to the collapse of the state,"" defense minister says .

"(CNN) -- Terrilynn Monette had no problem uprooting her life to help children. When the California native learned of the ""teachNOLA"" program, which sends educators to New Orleans to teach in impoverished areas, she packed her bags and headed to Louisiana. ""I always wanted to be a teacher, and what better place to teach than New Orleans, where passionate teachers are needed most?"" she said in a 2011 video. Her dedication and excellence in the classroom earned her a ""Teacher of the Year"" nomination in her district. But after a night celebrating the accolade with friends, the 26-year-old vanished. That was almost two weeks ago. With each passing day, her family's anxiety compounds. ""There's total emptiness in my life right now. I miss my daughter so, so much, no one can hardly believe the impact that she has had on our family,"" said Monette's mother, Toni Enclade. ""She's a beautiful person. She walks in the room, she lights up with her beautiful smile. I can't imagine anyone that would take her away from us."" Hundreds of volunteers and police have scoured New Orleans, but are no closer to finding Monette. She left no clues behind. A night of celebration . New Orleans police said she was last seen on March 2 at Parlay's, a bar in the Lakeview area of the city. One of the bartenders working that night had to ""cut off"" Monette, indicating the bartender felt she had had too much to drink and should no longer be served, bar manager Anna Boudousque said. Monette told her friends she was going to sleep in her car before driving home because she had been drinking, police said. She was seen about 4 a.m. talking to an unidentified man in the parking lot, police said. Authorities said that man has been interviewed and is not considered a suspect in the disappearance. Jefferson Parish sheriff's deputies even used magnets and grappling hooks to search a local bayou between the bar and Monette's home, but found no sign of her missing 2012 black Honda Accord. On Wednesday, search workers found a vehicle in the waters of Bayou St. John, but it was determined not to be Monette's car, police said. The vehicle was discovered by Equusearch, an independent search and rescue team out of Texas that has volunteered to help police comb the lagoons and waterways of New Orleans City Park. It discovered the car using a small sonar device attached to a boat that swept the waterway. Police then sent divers down to examine the vehicle, and confirmed it did not belong to Monette. Equusearch found additional vehicles, the group said Thursday, but none fit the description of Monette's car. Enclade said she believes someone has taken her daughter -- a new aunt -- against her will.

"(CNN) -- Crews bolstered by out-of-state help worked in Texas on Monday to contain large wildfires responsible for destroying close to 100 homes and other structures, officials said. ""We are all doing the best we can,"" said Lisa Nugent, director of the Chamber of Commerce in Fort Davis, where the Texas Forest Service said fire has already destroyed 40 to 50 homes. ""We have firefighters from all over the country."" She said it is too early for people to come to look at the damage. ""We don't want people coming back or visiting,"" Nugent said. The town is still in an ""imminent danger of fire,"" with several fires still burning nearby. ""I can see black smoke behind the courthouse,"" she said. The fire in Presidio County has grown to 80,000 acres with only 10% containment, the Forest Service said early Monday. That growth, according to fire operations chief Mark Sanford, came after the fire ""made a 12-mile run on Saturday.""   Officials still don't know what caused the fast-moving fire, he said. Despite the damage, Nugent said things could be much worse.  ""Tourism is huge"" in Fort Davis, she said, but none of the tourist structures have been burned. The downtown and the historic fort buildings are unscathed, she said. The blaze, known as the Rock House fire, is currently the largest fire burning in the United States and is just one of 10 fires burning more than 312,000 acres in Texas. Another 34 homes have burned in a fire in Midland County that has consumed over 16,500 acres and that the state agency on Sunday described as ""very active"" and not at all contained, officials said. A Red Cross shelter has been set up at Midland College for those displaced or otherwise affected by this wildfire. ""(Firefighters) can't outrun it,"" said Alan Craft, a spokesman for the state's Lone Star Incident Management Team. Another large fire near Swenson has scorched some 103,000 acres in three counties, according to the state Forest Service. Spokeswoman April Saginor said officials believe the Swenson fire has been that large for a couple of days, but were not able to remap it until Monday. As of Sunday night, the blaze across parts of Stonewall, Knox and King counties was totally uncontained despite the use of air resources, bulldozers, fire engines and other tools and personnel, a statement from the Forest Service said. Official say this fire was caused by a man cutting a pipe. There have been no evacuations yet related to another 60,000-acre blaze, this one in Potter and Moore counties near the city of Masterson. That fire is 50% contained but is still considered a threat to the towns of Dumas and Sunray, the Forest Service said. Gov. Rick Perry renewed a disaster proclamation in effect for all of Texas' 249 counties -- even though major fires are occurring in only 13 of them -- to expedite assistance in case of new fires, his office said Sunday in a statement. In addition to more than 750 personnel working with the Texas Forest Service, the governor's statement noted that two Blackhawk helicopters from the Texas Military Forces, bulldozers from the state transportation department and resources from 60 fire departments statewide were part of the effort. Improved wind conditions over the past couple of days have helped firefighters in their battle, but dry conditions remain and still pose a problem, CNN Meteorologist Monica O'Connor said Monday. Six new wildfires reported on Sunday were quickly brought under control, a Texas Forest Service statement said. Authorities in the Lone Star State have responded to 6,831 fires over 643,000 acres since wildfire season began. Texas is not alone, as wildfires are burning in large swaths of the Southwest and Midwest, fanned in part by dry, warm and windy conditions. In the past few days, the National Weather Service has issued ""red flag warnings"" for New Mexico, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas. Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin on Sunday extended a state of emergency for seven counties. The designation authorizes state agencies to make emergency purchases needed to quickly deliver resources to local jurisdictions, the state's emergency operations center said. Parts of Oklahoma remain under a  ""fire weather watch,"" which means that critical fire weather conditions are forecast to occur. Many southern counties in Texas are under a ""red flag warning,"" meaning conditions have created the potential for explosive fire growth. The National Weather Service's website urges residents to exercise extreme care with respect to all outdoor activities that could inadvertently cause wildfires.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Resourceful African filmmakers are using cell phones to tell their stories in spite of political censorship. Art school student Kiripi Katembo Siku listens during a mobile phone filmmaking workshop at the Académie des Beaux Arts in Kinshasa. Kiripi Katembo Siku, an art school student from the Democratic Republic of Congo is one such director who shot his first film using only a mobile phone. The ingeniously devised ""Voiture en Carton"" (""Cardboard Car"") provides a rare glimpse of street-life in Kinshasa, the country's capital, while highlighting the lengths filmmakers must go to in circumventing the eye of the law. While the country's name implies freedom of speech, filmmakers in the country's capital are restricted by government censorship. To get around these problems, Siku came up with a novel plan. He attached his mobile phone to a toy car, set it to film, and gave it to a young girl to pull behind her on a piece of string as she walked through the streets of Kinshasa. The film runs for seven minutes, during which time the toy car stops and starts (it also upends a number of times and has to be righted by Siku's young camerawoman) giving viewers a clandestine look at life in the capital -- the dancing feet of children, some teenagers gambling, and at one point a United Nations jeep passing by. Siku is one of a number of filmmakers in DR Congo who say using a mobile phone allows them to film in ways that were previously impossible. ""Camera phones are affordable, small and easy to maneuver,"" Siku told CNN. ""They allowed me to work more discreetly and get closer to my subjects."" Government officials try to keep reports of poverty and corruption quiet, which means filming permits have become virtually impossible for Congolese working in Kinshasa to obtain, according to filmmakers working there. Salim Amin, Chairman of Kenya-based African news organization, Africa 24 Media, which has operated in DRC, agrees that it can be very difficult for filmmakers to work in the country. ""[They] try and stop stories of corruption from coming out by refusing accreditation to locals from the Ministry of Information. That's the way they weed out people who will be critical to government,"" Amin told CNN. Those brave enough to defy the authorities and shoot without permission, whether or not they have an anti-government agenda, risk hefty fines, arrest, or worse. A spokesperson from the DRC government was not available for comment. Siku only started making films last year, when he participated in a mobile phone filmmaking workshop held by French filmmaker, Marie-Dominique Dhelsing in February 2008. The young Congolese says it gave him the inspiration he needed to carry on making films. ""After her course here in Kinshasa I fell in love with directing, editing and working in a team,"" Siku told CNN. Watch Siku's ""Voiture en Carton"" here. Dhelsing organizes mobile filmmaking master classes in deprived regions of the world to give young people in developing countries an opportunity to tell their stories. Although her Congolese workshop was officially organized for students at the Académie des Beaux Arts, Kinshasa's only arts school, Dhelsing also encouraged less privileged youths from nearby slums to attend her tutorials. ""The pupils who were most interested were coming from the roughest townships in Kinshasa,"" the 49-year-old told CNN. ""They would spend two and a half hours traveling to the school by foot because they didn't have money for a bus. ""For me it was very important that they could participate,"" she said. During the two weeks she spent in Kinshasa in 2008, Dhelsing and her trainees produced a total of eight short films -- an impressive tally given the logistical problems they faced. ""I wanted them to edit what they had shot, but there was little access to computers,"" she told CNN. ""We also had a lot of electricity problems,"" she continued. ""In Kinshasa, you have a period of at least two or three hours a day where you have no electricity."" Siku's film has been entered into the international section of mobile phone film festival, 5th Pocket Films Festival, which is being held in Paris in June. The festival organizers supported Dhelsing's mobile workshops by equipping her with camera phones. Laurence Herszberg, founder of Pocket Films, says the relative cheapness of mobile movies can serve as a stepping stone for emerging cineastes in poorer regions. ""Young filmmakers, knowing that it's very cheap, often decide to make their first feature film by shooting it on mobile, using it as an advertisement to show what they're capable of,"" Herszberg told CNN. Siku's mobile film allowed the young Congolese to successfully showcase his talents and opened the vital first door to a future in filmmaking. He is now working as an assistant director on a documentary about the economy of DR Congo's mining region, Katanga. Siku also continues to shoot on mobile phones and has, with a number of his workshop colleagues, founded YEBELA, a collective of video artists who show their films in the streets of Kinshasa. Dhelsing is pleased that her classes have taken on a momentum of their own. ""For the artists in the collective, it's a very important way to express themselves,"" she said. ""We've been in touch all year by e-mail and I support them, but they're doing their own thing now."" Now, she's seeking a new challenge. Having just returned from her second workshop in Johannesburg, Dhelsing is currently planning a third in the slums of São Paulo this September. ""Sometimes I think I must be crazy doing what I do,"" she told CNN. ""But if it wasn't for the workshops I would never get to see these places and meet these interesting people.""

"(CNN) -- The transition of science-fiction gadgets into scientific reality is seldom a simple process. More than 20 years on from the Back to the Future trilogy and a breakthrough in hoverboard technology is still eagerly anticipated -- not to mention anything close to ""Doc"" Brown's time-traveling DeLorean car. But a new research body at Arizona State University is aiming to bridge the gap between the lab and the most evocative inventions of the sci-fi genre. The Center for Science and the Imagination (CSI), which opened last month, will bring sci-fi writers into collaboration with inventors, engineers and technologists. See also: How search for aliens can sustain life on earth . The goal is to create a network hub for so-called ""moon shot"" ideas, where scientists and artists can meet, converse and potentially put their ideas into practice. Corporations, including computer-tech behemoth, Intel, and publisher, HarperCollins are already involved with the group's early endeavors. ""It's an unusual thing for a university to do because it brings together a variety of different people who wouldn't usually work together,"" says CSI director, Ed Finn. ""We want to create conversations that cut across all these different boundaries and get people thinking in a more expansive way about their own work."" One of the center's first projects has pitched acclaimed sci-fi writer, Neal Stephenson, with ASU professor and structural engineer, Keith Hjelmstad. Stephenson is a chief proponent of the dark sci-fi genre, Cyberpunk, and has spoken publicly and passionately about arresting the malaise he believes has stunted the imagination of American science and science fiction. The pair have so far probed the viability of a 20-kilometer tall steel tower that could launch vehicles into space more efficiently. While this may not be a project that can instantly deliver practical results, the hope is it will encourage scientists and sci-fi writers to think big and pose each other challenging questions. ""This is really what the whole Center for Science and the Imagination is all about,"" says Hjelmstad. ""The writers of science fiction or any writers for that matter are very different from the usual crowd that I hang with."" See also: Scientists to stimulate human brain inside supercomputer . ""People from outside engineering will toss in very basic questions that specialists will often forget to ask, in this case 'how high is the tallest structure you can build?'"" ""It was incredibly interesting for me to consider the open question: 'what can you do with structures?' which I hadn't really done before."" As it turns out, Hjelmstad's concludes that a 20-kilometer tall tower is possible but would likely never be built due to the resources required (some 55 million tons of steel, he says) and financial costs involved. For companies such as Intel however, solutions that can be immediately put into practice are not as important as the dialogues and ideas these inter-disciplinary interactions encourage -- for now at least. The technology giant is working with the CSI to create the Tomorrow Project USA, a new website designed to engender expert conversation on the future of subjects such as sustainability, energy and education. ""In science fiction writing and the conversations, you can explore how the technology can impact in both positive and negatives ... showing us the kinds of future we want and [just] as importantly the kind we don't want,"" says Steve Brown, Intel's mystically titled technology evangelist. ""It also allows [us to play] with the moral and ethical consequences for the technologies as well,"" Brown adds. Other projects in the pipeline at the center include a plan to design the ideal city of the future, drawing contributions from writers, engineers and urban designers. In the coming years meanwhile, the talents of other artists including musicians, painters, actors, dancers and those in the performance arts will be harnessed, predicts Finn. See also: $1 billion project to reach Earth's mantle . But as scientists, engineers and tech corporations benefit from opening their disciplines to exciting new ways of thinking, what's in it for the writers and artists? According to Kathryn Cramer, a sci-fi author and editor of Hieroglyph -- an anthology project that will compile conversations of scientists and authors at ASU for publication by HarperCollins -- the center will help inform a more realistic and artistically rich genre of sci-fi. ""For authors, having the contact with [scientists] allows for further refinement of their ideas into something that is potentially more workable,"" says Cramer. Some writers may already undertake such processes by themselves but by formalizing this relationship, Cramer believes a more fluent and rewarding conversation between science and sci-fi will arise. Like Hjelmstad, Brown and Finn before her however, Cramer tempers expectations by stating that the practical implementation of these ideas will likely have to wait. ""I don't think you can guarantee that the project will come up with ideas that can be put towards venture capitalists and off we go tomorrow. But science fiction has a proven ability to inspire scientists and start technological innovation,"" Cramer explains. ""It's worth doing but one should bear in mind that, in the past, where there have been ideas that have worked there has also been a sea of ideas that didn't work.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A third former Fullerton, California, police officer was charged in the beating death of a mentally ill homeless man, the Orange County district attorney said. Joseph Wolfe, 37, pleaded innocent Thursday to one count of involuntary manslaughter and one count of use of excessive force in connection with the death of 37-year-old Kelly James Thomas on July 7, 2011. The charges against Wolfe came as a result of a grand jury indictment handed down on Monday, District Attorney Tony Rackauckas said in a statement. Since Thomas' death, the district attorney's office ""has actively continued its investigation and legal review and decided to seek indictment against Wolfe following extensive legal and factual analysis and development of evidence,"" the statement said. California cop pleads not guilty in homeless man's death . Wolfe was released on $25,000 bail, according to authorities at the Orange County jail. He faces up to a maximum four years in prison, if convicted. Wolfe's defense attorney, Vicki Podberesky, did not immediately respond early Friday to a CNN request for comment. The indictment against Wolfe comes nearly a year after two other former Fullerton police officers were charged in the case. They were ordered to stand trial in May. The grand jury heard testimony from 10 witnesses and reviewed 113 exhibits of evidence over three days before handing down the indictment against Wolfe, the statement said. State law requires grand jury transcripts to be sealed for 10 days after the defense has received the documents. Thomas, a lifelong resident of Fullerton, was shirtless and carrying a backpack, and was wearing long pants and slippers, when Fullerton police were called to investigate a ""homeless"" man looking in car windows and pulling door handles of parked cars at the city's bus depot last July, according to a lawsuit filed by Thomas' father. Father sues California police . A security camera at the downtown bus depot provided 16 minutes of video of the officers questioning and then beating Thomas, who was schizophrenic. Former Officer Manuel Ramos is charged with second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter, and former Cpl. Jay Patrick Cicinelli is charged with involuntary manslaughter and felony use of excessive force. Both have pleaded not guilty. A pre-trial hearing is scheduled for November 30. Ramos, 37, a 10-year veteran of the police department, faces a maximum sentence of 15 years to life, if convicted, authorities have said. Cicinelli, 39, a 12-year Fullerton police veteran, faces a maximum of four years in prison, if convicted. Recently, Thomas' mother, Cathy, received $1 million from Fullerton's insurance reserves in an agreement to settle her claim against the city in her son's death, according to a city statement. Cathy Thomas, who's divorced from Frederick ""Ron"" Thomas, released the city and its police officers from all potential claims, the city's statement said. Thomas' father, Frederick Thomas Jr., filed a lawsuit in July against the city, its police chief and the six officers allegedly involved in the fatal incident. The lawsuit seeks more than $25,000 in damages. Homeless man cries 'help me' as cops fatally beat him in videotaped incident . CNN's Chelsea J.

"(CNN) -- A federal court jury in Detroit has awarded a $4.5 million judgment to the University of Michigan's first openly gay student body president in his suit against a former Michigan assistant attorney general who had written disparagingly about him on the Internet, the student's lawyer said. The jury came back with the award late Thursday against Andrew Shirvell, said Deborah Gordon, a lawyer representing the plaintiff, Chris Armstrong, 22, who graduated last year. A U.S. District Court jury found in Armstrong's favor on four counts -- defamation, stalking, intentional infliction of emotional distress and invasion of privacy, Gordon told CNN in a telephone interview. Shirvell was fired from his job in the attorney general's office in 2010 after targeting the student leader online and in person -- then lying about his actions to investigators, state Attorney General Mike Cox said at the time. Targeted student: 'It's hard not to say something' Shirvell ""repeatedly violated office policies, engaged in borderline stalking behavior and inappropriately used state resources,"" Cox said, referring to Shirvell's activities during his work day. Asked for specifics about Shirvell's conduct, Armstrong lawyer Gordon said, ""He said (Armstrong) had an orgy in a dorm room and sex in a park and that he had liquored up underage freshmen to recruit them to the 'homosexual lifestyle.'"" Shirvell also referred to Armstrong as ""Satan's representative"" on the Michigan Student Assembly, she said. ""He's a little out there,"" Gordon continued. Shirvell, himself a University of Michigan alumnus, told CNN that he is ""100% confident that the verdict will be overturned on appeal."" ""I think the jury award is grossly excessive,"" he said. ""It's absolutely outrageous. The jury's verdict was a complete trampling of my First Amendment rights."" He told CNN in 2010 that Armstrong ""is a radical homosexual activist who got elected ... to promote a very deep, radical agenda at the University of Michigan."" From the archives: Assistant attorney general blogs against gay student body president . Shirvell cited Armstrong's push for gender-neutral campus housing as something he opposed. ""What we're talking about is any man or woman wanting to choose to live together,"" he said at the time. ""That's a radical redefinition of gender norms."" Gordon said that Shirvell's claim is without merit. ""It's really simple,"" she said. ""Defamation refers to statements that are false that you say about another person. If you say my neighbor is having sex in a park with children, which is literally kind of what he said here, that is defamation. That is not First Amendment-protected. It's not opinion. It's provable as false. You can be held responsible financially. ""He wants to put all his crap -- which is nothing but a bunch of fabricated lies -- under the umbrella of the First Amendment. Shame on him."" Gordon said the multimillion-dollar judgment ""is probably not collectable"" at this time, since Shirvell has no job. But she said that had never been the point of the lawsuit. ""We've only always wanted Chris' name cleared,"" she said. ""All he (Shirvell) had to do was retract his lies"" and Armstrong would have dropped the case. She said Armstrong has graduated and is currently employed, but did not want to divulge for whom he is working.","NEW: Shirvell calls jury award ""grossly excessive""

James hit a long jumper with 27.9 seconds remaining in the game to give the Heat a four-point lead then locked up the win with two free throws after stealing a pass from the Spurs' Manu Ginobili. Dwyane Wade chipped in 23 points for the Heat, who won their third title overall. ""This was the hardest series we ever had to play, but we're a resilient team and we did what it took,"" he said. Reserve Shane Battier made six 3-pointers and had 18 points for Miami. James also had a team-high 12 rebounds in winning his second crown. Tim Duncan scored 24 points for the four-time champion Spurs. ""LeBron was unbelievable; Dwyane was great. I just think they found a way to get it done,"" he said. Duncan said he'll be haunted by two missed shots in the last minute, either of which would have tied the score. Spurs guard Tony Parker, who went 3-for-12 in Game 7 and scored just 10 points, had no excuses, saying he just couldn't get a good shooting rhythm. ""Tonight we did a great fight,"" he said. ""We just couldn't get over the hump. ... It's tough to come so close."" The Spurs' Danny Green, who in the first five games set a NBA Finals record for 3-pointers, went 1-for-12 from the field in Game 7.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- AirTran Airways apologized Friday to members of a Muslim family for kicking them off a plane and refusing to rebook them despite requests from FBI agents who had cleared them of wrongdoing. Kashif Irfan, left, and his brother Atif Irfan were among family members removed from the flight Thursday. The families of Atif Irfan, a tax attorney, and his brother Kashif Irfan, an anesthesiologist, were removed from a flight in Washington before takeoff Thursday after a passenger reported hearing Atif Irfan's wife say something suspicious. The FBI interviewed the family and cleared them of wrongdoing. ""We regret that the issue escalated to the heightened security level it did,"" AirTran said in a statement Friday afternoon. ""But we trust everyone understands that the security and the safety of our passengers is paramount."" Read the full statement . The airline said it had refunded the family's money and offered to fly the family home to Washington free. One family member, Kashif Irfan, said Friday he was ""very appreciative and surprised"" by AirTran's apology. ""It's a very generous gesture,"" he said. The statement was an abrupt about-face for the airline, which three hours earlier had issued a press release with an unapologetic description of the incident. In that statement, the airline said it did not re-book the family only because the security concern had not been resolved, and because one member of the group ""became irate and made inappropriate comments."" That account differed from accounts from the family and the FBI. The FBI said agents interviewed the family, resolved the security concerns and then tried to help re-schedule the flight with the airline. The FBI ultimately helped the family book a flight on US Airways.  Watch how Muslims find climate of fear at airport » . The dispute occurred about 1 p.m. Thursday as Atif Irfan and his brother Kashif Irfan boarded AirTran flight 175 at Reagan National Airport near Washington for a trip to Orlando, Florida. They were accompanied by their wives, a sister and three children. Federal officials say a passenger on the plane notified a flight attendant about a suspicious conversation, and the flight attendant notified the pilot and Federal air marshals who were aboard. The pilot asked the air marshals to remove the passengers, said Transportation Security Administration spokesman Christopher White. ""The conversation, as we were walking through the plane trying to find our seats, was just about where the safest place in an airplane is,"" said Inayet Sahin, Kashif Irfan's wife. ""We were [discussing whether it was safest to sit near] the wing, or the engine or the back or the front. But that's it. We didn't say anything else that would raise any suspicion."" The conversation did not contain the words ""bomb,"" ""explosion,"" ""terror"" or other words that might have aroused suspicion, Atif Irfan said. ""When we were talking, when we turned around, I noticed a couple of girls kind of snapped their heads,"" said Sobia Ijaz, Atif Irfan's wife. ""I kind of thought to myself, 'Oh, you know, maybe they're going to say something.' It didn't occur to me that they were going to make it such a big issue."" Authorities first removed Atif Irfan and Sobia Ijaz, then returned for the rest of the family, including three small children. They also removed a family friend, Abdul Aziz, a Library of Congress attorney who was coincidentally taking the same flight and had been seen talking with the family. After the FBI interviewed family members, the agency released them, Irfan said. ""The FBI agents actually cleared our names,"" said Sahin. ""They went on our behalf and spoke to the airlines and said, 'There is no suspicious activity here. They are clear. Please let them get on a flight so they can go on their vacation,' and they still refused.""  Watch Muslims recount how they were kicked off plane » . In statements Thursday night and Friday morning, AirTran said it ""complied with all TSA, law enforcement and Homeland Security directives and had no discretion in the matter."" But TSA spokesman White said it was the pilot's decision to remove the family and the airline and pilot had the ultimate authority to decide whether to allow the family back on AirTran flights. An FBI spokesman confirmed Friday that agents intervened on behalf of the family with AirTran. When AirTran declined to book the family, agents helped them get tickets with US Airways, FBI spokesman Richard Kolko said. ""Our agents went way out of their way to make sure this family went on their trip,"" Kolko said. iReport.com: Share your story . After the family and friend were taken for questioning, the remaining 95 passengers, the crew and baggage were removed from the plane and rescreened, AirTran said. Family members said Friday they had not decided whether to accept AirTran's apology, saying there were a variety of opinions. Meanwhile, an Islamic group -- the Council on Islamic American Relations, or CAIR -- filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Transportation, which oversees airlines.

"(CNN) -- War-torn Somalia moved a step closer to stability this September after picking its first president elected on home soil in decades. Political newcomer Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, an academic and activist who has also worked for the United Nations and other organizations, was sworn in the capital Mogadishu after defeating incumbent president Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed. The milestone vote was hailed by the international community as a sign of improving security in a nation plunged into chaos after years of vicious civil hostilities. Despite the move toward a more permanent government, the new president faces an uphill battle to rebuild the country and restore its shattered economy and crumbling infrastructure. Even though insurgents have fled Mogadishu and guns have fallen silent, portions of Somalia still remain lawless as large parts of the country are under the control of militants, such as the al Qaeda-linked group Al Shabaab. Distinguished Somali professor Ahmed Ismail Samatar, who also ran for president in the recent elections and is now a member of the new parliament, says the country's new leader is facing ""heavy challenges that need to be lifted."" ""He [Mohamud] cares about the country,"" says Samatar, leader of the HiilQaran political party. ""And [there is] the possibility that his leadership will then bring a shift in gear and therefore moving towards that future that needs to be born."" Read related: Somali women defy danger to write history . Somalia may have been brought to its knees by decades of war but in the 1960s, after it threw off the chains of colonialism to gain its independence, it was a model of democracy, says Samatar. ""It's the first place in the continent, in sub-Saharan Africa, in which the head of the state will be defeated in parliamentary transparent elections and he will hand the keys ... to the victor and tell the nation that democracy is a precious thing. This is in 1967 -- the first sub-Saharan African head of state to be defeated in an election and then hand peacefully the order of the state and the institutions to the new president."" Somalia was formed through the union of newly independent territories British Somaliland and Italian Somaliland in 1960. Aden Abdullah Osman Daar was Somalia's president until the 1967 election when Abdirashid Ali Shermarke became the country's second leader. But in 1969 he was assassinated; a military coup immediately followed and that regime ruled for more than 20 years. In January 1991, dictator Maxamed Siyaad Barre was overthrown in a civil war waged by clan-based guerrillas and warfare continues to this day.

""There are blades of hope growing among these cobblestones of difficult history,"" he explains, noting that Somalis are now exhausted by the ongoing war and civil strife. ""They are absolutely tired of a particular kind of religious Islamist militancy that wants to destroy the culture; they are tired of warlords who hijack particular opportunities for their own self interests ... and destroy what it's in place. ""So that exhaustion brings a certain kind of yearning for a new time and that's hope.

"(EW.com) -- When HBO airs ""Behind the Candelabra"" on May 26, the world will get to see Matt Damon play Liberace's drug-addled, surgically enhanced lover -- a role about as far from Jason Bourne as it gets. But Damon, who sat down with costar Michael Douglas to talk with EW for this week's cover story, says he isn't ruling out a return to his blockbuster spy franchise despite the fact that he handed the reins over to Jeremy Renner in last year's ""The Bourne Legacy."" That movie rebooted the series by introducing the idea of a world with multiple Bourne-style secret agents â€” which means the original Jason Bourne could still be out there somewhere. ""Tony Gilroy, who wrote the first one and the second one, came up with an idea: I think they look at it as kind of the reverse of 'X-Men,'"" says Damon, who opted not to sign on for a fourth film because he and director Paul Greengrass ""couldn't figure out"" a script. ""Whereas with 'X-Men,' you get a giant bunch of superheroes and then do the 'Wolverine' spinoff, I think Tony pitched it as, 'OK, we started with the 'Wolverine' spinoff. Now let's try to make the 'X-Men.' So I'll create all these other programs, and you can have your evergreen that way. There'll be other agents.'"" Kevin Smith posts title page of 'Clerks III' So does this mean Damon and Renner might share the screen in a Bourne movie someday? ""That would be their dream,"" says Damon. ""Tony's whole thing was, 'Look, my story won't preclude Matt from doing another one. This one can live on a parallel track.'"" Elisabeth Hasselbeck to exit 'The View'? In the meantime, Damon is taking on outside-the-box projects like ""Behind the Candelabra,"" though the actor says he was surprised at how much he could relate to the bizarre love story between Liberace (Douglas) and Scott Thorson (Damon). ""My way in was my own marriage and understanding how these long-term relationships work,"" he says. ""Their relationship is absurd and funny and tragic and heartbreaking. And I realized: That's all of our lives. I found the relationship was highly relatable."" See the original article at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- At least five of the bodies found this week in a shallow grave near Mexico City are those of teens who were kidnapped from a bar three months ago, Mexico's attorney general said Friday. The announcement appears to shed light on a crime that jolted the capital city: The kidnapping of 12 youths from an after-hours club during daylight on the morning of May 26. Authorities on Thursday said they found a clandestine mass grave east of Mexico City. On Friday, the federal attorney general said the grave -- a shallow grave covered by concrete at an eco park in a state neighboring Mexico City -- contained 13 bodies. Five of them were those of youths who'd been taken from the Mexico City club, the attorney general said. Earlier, authorities said the grave was at a ranch. The site is in the town of Tlalmanalco, in the state of Mexico, about 30 miles east of Mexico City, the state-run Notimex news agency reported. Authorities haven't said what led them to the grave. The May 26 incident at the after-hours bar shocked residents of Mexico City, who for the most part have been spared from the violence seen in other areas. The owner of the bar, a co-owner and two bar employees have been arrested in the case. Mexico: As dangerous, and safe, as ever .

"(CNN) -- J.J. Abrams cast a meaty hook into the Web waters on Aug. 19, a teaser for a new entertainment project that we may or may not know anything about. The mystery box angler loves using this kind of bait: ""Stranger"" is reminiscent of his puzzling promo stuff for Super-8 or the crypto-content that the ""Lost"" brain trust used to feed fans during hiatus. (Remember ""The Last Supper"" ads prior to season 6?) Decoding this kind of stuff isn't for everyone. And for some, it annoys as much as it amuses. Regardless: We're biting. Because we are easily amused, and because we ran out of"" Breaking Bad"" analysis to read, and because no one knows how to bait a hook quite like J.J. Abrams. We love how he turns marketing hype into storytelling fun. What's ""Stranger"" about? Five theories — none of which involve ""Star Wars Episode VII"" (we assume it's still wayyy too early for that). Star Wars Galaxy: See Full Coverage . 1. It's a tease for NBC's ""Believe,"" a new show from J.J. Abrams and director Alfonso Cuaron coming early next year. A sci-fi/fantasy series with elements reminiscent of ""Firestarter,"" ""Harry Potter"" and Kung Fu, ""Believe"" concerns a girl named Bo (the spectacularly named Johnny Sequoyah) with emerging supernatural abilities, raised and protected by a group known as ""True Believers"" for a righteous purpose. Evil forces threaten to exploit, corrupt or destroy her, so the Believers bust a death row inmate out of the clink to serve as her bodyguard. The ""Stranger"" teaser shows a man with stringy hair crawling out of the ocean in the dead of night. This could be Bo's protector, Tate (Jack McLaughlin), who also has stringy hair, and we could be witnessing the dénouement of his prison escape. The seemingly sinister watcher with the stitched lips could be an evil agent. Or maybe the righteous, shadowy Believers prefer fearsome visages. Does this video presage a viral video series that will flesh out character backstory or mythology for ""Believe""? Because that would be a cool idea. 2. It's a tease for a new novel written by Doug Dorst in collaboration with J.J. Abrams, scheduled for publication on October 29. The book is entitled ""S."" and Mulholland Books summarizes the opus hazily and thusly: ""At the core of this multilayered literary puzzle of love and adventure is a book of mysterious provenance. In the margins, another tale unfolds—through the hand-scribbled notes, questions, and confrontations of two readers. Between the pages, online, and in the real world, you'll find evidence of their interaction, ephemera that bring this tale vividly to life."" In other words: ""S."" is more than a novel. It's a transmedia entertainment experience, with viral elements that apparently include this postcard from a seaside town in Brazil. Sounds like ""House of Leaves"" meets ""Griffin and Sabine: An Extraordinary Correspondence"" meets ""The 39 Clues"" meets the cult classic UPN TV series ""Nowhere Man."" Is the (amnesiac?) ""Stranger"" who washes up on the beach in the video the ""S"" of the book's title? A telling clue? Dorst's previous novels include ""Alive In Necropolis"" (sewn lips guy in video = living dead guy) and ""The Surf Guru"" (guy crawling out of surf = well, surf). 3. It's a tease for a new TV series produced by J.J. Abrams for Warner Bros. Television based on the DC Comics superhero the Phantom Stranger. I really, really, really want this to be true. 4. It's a tease for a ""Lost"" spin-off series, to be told through viral videos and other alt media. All new mysterious castaways! All new mysterious Others! All new mysterious mysteries to mystify and mystery mystery yadda yadda yadda mystery OH LIKE YOU DON'T WANT THIS. 5. It's a tease for a ""Star Wars"" movie about a runaway Boba Fett clone who escapes the hatchery on Kamino and teams up with a rogue Jedi with sewn lips to open a fish taco stand on Tatooine.

It wasn't immediately clear where the two rockets landed. They caused property damage, but no one was hurt, the IDF said. One rocket was intercepted by Israel's missile defense system between the northern Israeli cities of Nahariya and Acre, the IDF said. Information on what happened to the fourth wasn't immediately available. Earlier, the IDF said all the rockets besides the intercepted one fell outside Israeli territory.

"(CNN) -- Deposed Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, appeared in court Sunday as his retrial resumed on charges involving the killing of hundreds of protesters during the popular 2011 uprising that led to his ouster. Mubarak was convicted on the charges last year and sentenced to life in prison, but appealed the ruling and was granted a retrial. A court ordered Mubarak released last week and placed under house arrest while he awaits a retrial. The 85-year-old Mubarak had been held since shortly after he was removed from power. The ousted autocratic leader's health has been a bone of contention during his trial and incarceration. He suffered a heart attack after relinquishing power and had said that he was physically unfit to stand trial. Opinion: What Mubarak's release means . Muslim Brotherhood trial . The spiritual leader of the Muslim Brotherhood was also to appear in a Cairo courtroom Sunday to face charges of inciting violence that took the lives of eight protesters in the wake of former President Mohamed Morsy's ouster from power. Morsy was elected after Mubarak was toppled. But Mohamed Badie did not appear in court. Last week, the military arrested Badie, the group's supreme guide, and Safwat Hegazy, a preacher and hardline supporter of the movement. They were among about 100 members of the Muslim Brotherhood taken into custody on Tuesday. Morsy, who was deposed by the military amid widespread protest over his rule, has been held since early July. Egypt has been in turmoil since Morsy's removal from office, with the military battling Muslim Brotherhood members and other Morsy supporters. This month, about 900 people -- citizens as well as members of security forces -- were killed. The deaths occurred when the military used force to clear two pro-Morsy sit-in sites in Cairo.

"(CNN) -- BP said Wednesday it is heading to the Louisiana coast to test whether tar balls and oil found on shore after Hurricane Isaac are from the company's 2010 Gulf oil spill. State officials reported tar balls and a large oil mat along the Gulf shore south of New Orleans, and the U.S. Coast Guard reported finding three oiled birds in the area on Monday. BP spokesman Ray Melick said the area is one where BP teams were already helping with cleanup from the 2010 spill before Isaac arrived. As soon as they're given the all-clear, they will return to do more cleanup and test whether the new oil is from their spill or another source. At least 13,000 Louisiana homes damaged by Hurricane Isaac . ""There's a lot of oil out there that may not be ours,"" Melick said. One sample is already being tested and more are heading to the lab, according to the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority of Louisiana, which is coordinating with other state agencies to test the contents. The area is near Fourchon Beach and Grand Isle. The same area was heavily affected by the spill, which happened in April 2010 after an explosion aboard the Transocean Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico. BP had contracted the rig, which had 126 workers on it, 11 of whom are presumed dead. It's not clear whether the hurricane swept the tar balls ashore or exposed them under the sand, U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer Bill Colclough said. In any case, he said, pollution after a hurricane is expected because the force of the storms can bring oil and other debris to the surface. Certain areas are still closed to recreational and commercial fishing because of the BP spill, state officials said.. People on Grand Isle said they were hopeful Isaac would stir up the waters and move leftover oil out of the area so it could help revive the fishing waters off the coast.

"(CNN) -- Oh, the stories we storytellers tell. Like the story of brave Manti Te'o and his doomed girlfriend. We love a good story. We love spinning a good yarn. And we repeat and repeat and repeat them. Babe Ruth was a big boy from an orphanage. Seabiscuit was a little horse that lost its first 17 races. Jim Thorpe was a Native American born in 1887 or '88 (as far as we know) with the name Wa-Tho-Huck. It is their legend, their lore. The same way that George Washington cut down that tree or Abe Lincoln split those logs. The same way that Lana Turner was discovered at a drugstore called Schwab's or that Sylvester Stallone wrote the part of Rocky but wouldn't sell the script unless he could play it. Documented achievement is what turns a man or woman into a public figure. But the story behind the story, well, that is also a telltale aspect of any human's fame. Yes, he did win this, she did win that, but come on, tell me a little more. How did they get this far? Where did they come from? Who influenced them? What else should we know? Muhammad Ali wasn't a mere boxer; he was a man who changed his name and faith, a man who would fight anybody in a ring but refused to go to a war, a perfect physical specimen and a loudmouth who fell frail and all but mute from an affliction he couldn't beat. Lots of fighters won fights. The stories are what have made Ali Ali. It separates names from the norm. He or she is not just a success but a remarkable story, an inspiration, a believe-it-or-not. He was a left-handed pitcher with no right hand who threw a no-hitter for the New York Yankees. (Jim Abbott.) He ran in the Olympic Games on prosthetic legs. (Oscar Pistorius.) She sprinted to an Olympic gold even though they once nearly amputated her feet. (Gail Devers.) You can't make up stories like those. Joe DiMaggio was a ballplayer. We know that Joe played ball better than most. But we also know Joe was married to Marilyn Monroe. We cannot tell you a lot about Willie Mays or Stan Musial except how they played ball. Both played it as well as Joe did ... hey, maybe better. But in some cases, the stories of certain greats are as unforgettable as their deeds. So, we tell their tales. The subjects often furnish the details. We rely on honesty for accuracy. A story that has been reported is a story that ends up repeated because it must be true. We lazily assume facts not in evidence. Or we lean on: ""Who would make up such a thing?"" Which brings us to Manti Te'o. The grim fairy tale of The Linebacker Of Notre Dame is one we likely will tell for a while. We woke up Thursday morning and began reading a story that got curiouser and curiouser with every sentence. His girlfriend wasn't real? She wasn't in a car crash? She didn't die of leukemia? He never met her? She didn't even exist??? Irish blarney is a myth, is it not? Pots o' gold and St. Patrick and the snakes and how are things in Glocca Morra and all that? Aye, we aren't so gullible that we will swallow anything, would we, now? So, OK. We tell and retell the true and false legends of Knute Rockne and winning one for the Gipper and all that, but we don't really mind. And maybe that October sky wasn't really as blue-grey as Grantland Rice told us it was when those Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse rode to a great Notre Dame victory on the ol' gridiron. ""South Bend, it sounds almost like dancing!"" gushed Katharine Hepburn in ""The Philadelphia Story,"" and what a funny story that was. Manti Te'o's story, however .... not so funny. He is a Notre Dame football star. Trust me, this alone is not a news event. Notre Dame turns out football stars the way Hostess turned out Twinkies. One after another after another. He is also a Hawaiian kid with an apostrophe in his surname. Now that, that is not something you see on a Notre Dame football field every Saturday. A nice, noteworthy thing, something that separated Te'o from the pack, somewhat. He is also a natural born leader. One who helped take Notre Dame to an undefeated season -- rare, in this day and age -- and to the national championship game. In the vote for the Heisman Trophy, given to college football's top player of any given season, Te'o was the runner-up. That in itself is an honor, but for a linebacker to do such a thing, a defensive player, it is truly cool. Ahhh, but there was more to the Manti Te'o story, as we watched that story unfold. He had this girlfriend, see. Lennay Kekua was her lovely name. And she died. A few months ago, she was in a car crash, we were told. And then doctors found she also had leukemia, we were told. Her death, as well as that of his grandmother, broke Te'o's heart. But on he played, gallantly, valiantly, fighting on for the Fighting Irish, remaining undefeated against adversity. Until at some point it turned out to be a hoax. Which at some point Notre Dame's administrators discovered. Which at some point Te'o confirmed, although not publicly, not before that January 7 championship game against Alabama. Brent Musburger made the Alabama quarterback's girlfriend an overnight sensation that night, gushing about her looks. Musburger did not make the Notre Dame linebacker's girlfriend a star that night. She wasn't there. Turns out, she was never anywhere. We love a good story and will continue to tell them. I, myself, once wrote of a Notre Dame football star, Chris Zorich, who played in the Orange Bowl one night, flew home to Chicago the next morning and found his mother dead inside their home. I made people cry with that story. I damn near cried myself while typing it. Manti Te'o's story makes me want to laugh as much as cry. Mainly because I can barely comprehend it. All those stories being told out there on TV and in print about his ""girlfriend"" -- uh, he might have mentioned to someone that he'd never even met her. How do the movies put it? ""Based on a true story?"" Well, based on a story, anyhow. Everybody's is. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mike Downey.","Mike Downey: We love spinning a good yarn, like Manti Te'o and his doomed girlfriend .

"Mumbai, India (CNN) -- Indian police arrested a fifth suspect Sunday in the alleged gang rape of a female photographer, authorities said, in a case that has renewed outrage over safety of women in the nation. Soon after the sexual assault Thursday, police chief Satyapal Singh said they were searching for five suspects. The alleged rape of the 23-year-old woman in the financial hub of Mumbai is the latest shocking sexual assault to make headlines in the South Asian nation. The photographer and a male colleague were on assignment in the area for a print publication when some men approached them, according to Mumbai police commissioner Satypal Singh. The two had walked from a train station to a nearby mill, the woman said in a statement released by police. One of the men claimed to be a railway employee and said, ""Our boss has seen you taking photos; you will have to come with us."" According to the woman, he refused to let her talk to his boss, instead leading them away. Then, somewhere near the exit, one of the accused pointed at the photojournalist's colleague, saying he was responsible for a killing a few days ago. ""I pleaded with them to let us go, but they shouted at me and threatened me,"" the woman said. She and her colleague were taken further inside the mill complex. There, they offered their camera and phone, begging to be let go. Instead, ""they tied my friend's hands with (a) belt"" as two others joined the group, the woman said. ""Three people stayed with my friend, and the two took me behind a wall,"" she added. That's where the attack allegedly occurred. The victim said her mother called her phone multiple times, before one of the men switched it off. The woman said she was threatened with, among other things, sharp pieces of a broken beer bottle. Police have since released sketches of all five suspects. The victim was in stable condition at a local hospital. The attack shocked Mumbai residents, who consider their city safer than the capital, New Delhi. According to the National Crime Records Bureau, 221 rape cases were reported in Mumbai in 2012. Sexual harassment in India: 'The story you never wanted to hear' But figures provided by the government show that there has been a rape reported to police every day in Mumbai between January and March. The average number of reported rapes in a month in 2013 in the city rose to 30.33, from 19.25 in 2012. Delhi Police said the number of reported rapes in the capital had jumped from 179 for the first 3Â½ months of last year to 463 for the same period this year. A rise in the number of rapes reported does not necessarily mean that more are being committed. It may be that recent high-profile cases have encouraged women to come forward with complaints. The case mirrors the December gang rape and death of a 23-year-old university student in the Indian capital. The victim later died at a hospital in Singapore, sparking an outcry that quickly grew to include widespread concerns about women's safety and inequalities, triggering demonstrations in various cities. In response, the nation's lawmakers have introduced tougher laws and punishments for sexual crimes and harassment. Despite such action, frequent episodes of sexual violence are reported in India. Across India, 24,923 cases of rape were reported last year, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. India grapples with rape and sexual violence . Journalist Dharmesh Thakkar contributed to this report from Mumbai, and CNN's Greg Botelho contributed from Atlanta.","Victim says she and her colleague were approached in a mill compound .

"(CNN) -- It's been sort of a rough week for Google+. Fresh on the heels of reports that activity on Google's social network -- the tech giant's effort to cut into Facebook's empire -- has dropped sharply since its public rollout, a Google engineer accidentally shared a memo calling the site ""a knee-jerk reaction"" and a ""study in short-term thinking."" Google+, which launched by invitation only in June, has been a hit among so-called ""tech elite"" journalists, bloggers and others heavily immersed in the technology and social-networking world. But adoption by the general public, namely the people behind Facebook's roughly 800 million accounts, has been slower. Engineer Steve Yegge blames, in part, blames Google's failure to share the site's programming platform with developers who could have built games and other apps to make it a more robust online hangout. How do we know? He accidentally shared what was supposed to be an internal memo with the world. On Google+. ""Google+ is a knee-jerk reaction, a study in short-term thinking, predicated on the incorrect notion that Facebook is successful because they built a great product,"" Yegge wrote in what was supposed to be an internal memo. ""But that's not why they are successful. Facebook is successful because they built an entire constellation of products by allowing other people to do the work. So Facebook is different for everyone."" The post, which Yegge deleted but is still being shared on other people's Google+ pages, says Facebook's rich set of apps helps attract and keep users. ""Some people spend all their time on Mafia Wars,"" he wrote. ""Some spend all their time on Farmville. There are hundreds or maybe thousands of different high-quality time sinks available, so there's something there for everyone."" What's worse is that, in a follow-up post, he mistakenly made the memo public because he's ""not what you might call an experienced Google+ user."" The post said he'd talked to Google's public-relations department and it was understanding about his mistake. ""(T)hey went out of their way to help me understand that we're an opinionated company, and not one of the kinds of companies that censors their employees,"" he wrote. The memo comes on the heels of a report from Chitika Insights, a Web analytics firm, saying traffic on Google+ has plummeted 60% since it opened to the public on September 20. On that day, Chitika reported, traffic spiked 1,200% from before, when an invitation was required to join the network. But, just a week later, it had fallen back to roughly the same level it was before the public rollout. ""It would appear that although high levels of publicity were able to draw new traffic to Google+, few of them saw reason to stay,"" Chitika said in its report, released Friday. The firm puts forward two theories: 1) that the supply of social-media users is limited (and, presumably, mostly already on Facebook) and 2) that while it has a ""striking new interface, rapid release of new features, and focus on user interaction,"" Google+ doesn't offer much that's truly unique. While Web analytics can be an imprecise science (companies use different programs and, as such, often end up with different figures), the report spoke to the general perception of how the network has fared. To throw one more jab, tech blogs were noting with some degree of snark that Google CEO Eric Schmidt appears to have finally joined Google+ -- more than three months after it was launched. Mashable's Ben Parr noted in an October 4 post that the low level of public usage by Google's top brass (he counted a total of 22 posts from co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin) sends the wrong message. ""It doesn't matter how you slice it,"" he wrote. ""If Google's management truly believed in Google+ as the future of the company, they would be more engaged.""","Google Plus, struggling to catch on as a Facebook competitor, is having a rough week .

""If I had to do it over again, would we have announced it when we did it? Yeah, we would have. And I'll take responsibility for that,"" DeWine said at a news conference. Although DeWine said he should have gone public with the program sooner, he gave no indication that the state would change or stop using the program. He did announce that an advisory board will be created to review the system's usage and to suggest policy changes to avoid misuse of the program. The program allows police to quickly compare a photograph of a suspect or crime victim to an electronic pool of mug shots and driver's license photos in the Ohio database. Comparisons are made of facial measurements from one image to the next in search of a match. Similar programs are already being used in dozens of other states, according to a statement from DeWine. Ohio law enforcement agencies began using the facial recognition technology in June, the attorney general's statement said. DeWine's concession that he should have let the public know about the program sooner was immediately met with criticism. ""The time for press conferences and advisory boards was months ago,"" Gary Daniels, associate director of the ACLU of Ohio, said in a statement. ""This system needs to be shut down until there are meaningful, documented rules in place to keep this information secure, protect the privacy of innocent people, and prevent government abuse of this new tool."" The facial recognition technology was developed in 2010 and has been used 2,677 times by Ohio law enforcement since its unofficial release in June, according to DeWine's statement. There was no indication how many of those uses had solved cases. ""When a wanted offender is identified quickly, it can prevent additional crimes and even save lives, and that is what this new technology aims to do,"" DeWine said. In addition to easily identifying suspects, the technology assists law enforcement officials in identifying homicide victims, missing persons who suffer from Alzheimer's, dementia or amnesia, and human trafficking victims, he added. But the ACLU's Daniels argued, ""Without specific limits on what government can do with this technology, its use will inevitably and eventually spread to Ohioans who are not criminal suspects."" Misuse of the facial recognition technology is a felony offense, according to the Attorney General's statement.","The program uses a database of photos from drivers' licenses and mug shots .

"(CNN) -- It wasn't easy for 59-year-old Margie White to ask her husband, Dick, for a divorce after 37 years of marriage. ""It really was the most courageous thing that I had to do,"" she said. The couple met in college and married young. They settled down in a rambling, split-level house in the leafy suburbs of northern Virginia and raised two sons, now grown. But they struggled over the years to communicate and connect, they say, and they slowly grew apart. When one son and his wife had a child, Margie spent more than eight months living in Pennsylvania helping out with the baby. It was during her time there that she realized how much she preferred living on her own. ""We really did struggle,"" she said. ""We gave it our best shot. We really tried. We were no strangers to marriage counseling, when it came to that, and individual counseling, but there just wasn't the glue to hold it together anymore, for me."" Dick agreed. ""It was always sort of lurking in the background there,"" he said. ""When Margie put it on the table it just seemed like, OK, yeah, we really should do this, and let's try to do it right."" Baby boomers looking for love online . The Whites' story is part of a larger trend. Even as divorce rates for the general population have stabilized over the past several decades, they are on the rise among baby boomers. Divorce rates among couples over 50 have doubled in the last 20 years, according to a study by Bowling Green State University. In 1990, fewer than one in 10 people who divorced were 50 or older. In 2009, that figure was one in four. Using data from the federal government's 2009 American Community Survey, the study also looked at the demographics of divorce and found that rates for those over 50 were highest among black couples and lowest among white couples. Hispanics fell in the middle. Older adults who divorced also tended to be less educated than those who remained married. The authors identified several factors that could explain the rising rates, from longer life spans to the changing marital biographies of many baby boomers. They found the divorce rate for those who were in their second or third marriage was 2.5 times higher than for those in first marriages. ""Increasingly, these are baby boomers. They were the first generation to come of age when we saw the rapid acceleration in premarital cohabitation and divorce rates in the 1970s and the early 1980s,"" said co-author Susan L. Brown. She also pointed to boomers' changing ideas about marriage. ""We have high expectations for what constitutes a good marriage today and we're looking for self-fulfillment and individual happiness in our relationships,"" Brown said. ""When you are 60, 65 you retire, (and say) 'Well, I can live another 20, 25 years. Do I want to spend my life with that person? Is she or he making me happy?' And if not, well, divorce is a viable alternative."" Dick White, now 62, said members of his generation are used to getting what they want and that what many boomers want is changing now that they are entering a new phase of life. ""There was a joke that one of the retirement counselors made at a seminar that I went through as part of my retirement planning,"" he said. ""The counselor said that couples will look at each other and say, 'Well, I married you for life, but not for lunch.' That, OK, now you have all day looking at each other, trying to deal with each other. What do we do for lunch? Previously, you kind of went through your business day in your own world and you got together in the evening for family time, children time, relationship time. Now you have deal with each other for all day long, and that's different. And can you do it for another 20 years? Maybe not."" New Beginnings: A divorced and separated persons support group . Doing it ""right"" While the Whites decided their marriage was over, that didn't mean their relationship was. Dick lives just a few miles away from Margie and still helps out with maintenance at the home they once shared. When Margie was in a minor car accident recently, Dick was the first person she called. ""I feel like it's worked out the best for both of us, because living together didn't work for us at all well,"" Margie said. ""We used to joke about how maybe if we had a duplex maybe we'd get along better. But this is actually better."" Both said part of the reason they have been able to maintain a positive relationship in the six months since their divorce was the way they went about the process. The Whites had a so-called ""collaborative divorce."" Each had his or her own lawyer, but they used a neutral financial planner and mental health professional to help them get through the process smoothly. Collaborative divorces aim to avoid the traditional adversarial route of most divorces. And while a judge has to sign off on the agreement to make it official, the process is meant to avoid courtroom fights. ""We worked it out. We wrote it down,"" Dick explained. ""The lawyers put the proper language on it, and we sent it to the court. It says, 'We've already decided what we want to do with the rest of our lives. Now please, your honor, sign.'"" Divorce over 50 raises important issues . The rise in newly single boomers like the Whites raises important issues, from loneliness and financial concerns to dealing with failing health in their later years. ""When these folks face health challenges, they are not going to have a spouse at the ready to provide for them,"" Brown said. ""Traditionally in America, that is what we've relied on. The No. 1 caregiver has been the spouse."" Caregiving for loved ones the 'new normal' for boomers . The Whites both take precautions now that they are living alone. Margie has a friend she e-mails each morning to let her know she's OK, while Dick religiously carries his cell phone while working around the house in case he falls and gets hurt. Those concerns aside, both Margie and Dick have taken advantage of their new lives. Margie, who is retired but works part-time as a nanny, is learning about Buddhist meditation, while Dick joined a boat club and now rows several times a week on a nearby reservoir. He also teaches pottery classes near his home. They have begun to wade into the dating world, but aren't necessarily looking to get married again. ""Hope springs eternal, doesn't it?"" Margie said. ""I would like to have a life partner. I don't know about marriage. I think the statistics for a second marriage are grimmer than they are for the first. I certainly would like to have a special someone in my life."" Dick said he does not define himself by whether he is married or not. ""That's a particular legal statement that doesn't necessarily in itself matter. It's the relationships that matter.""","Margie and Dick White got divorced after 37 years of marriage .

"(CNN) -- Serena Williams has lost only four matches this year -- and the world No. 1 is hoping her most recent setback can help her become the oldest winner of a U.S. Open women's singles title. The American is favored for a fifth triumph at Flushing Meadows, but this month's defeat by second-ranked Victoria Azarenka has given the Belorussian hope of avenging last year's final heartbreak. Azarenka served for the title just under 12 months ago in New York, but Williams fought back to claim her 15th grand slam title. She has since added another, at the French Open in June, but suffered a shock reverse against Sabine Lisicki in the last 16 at Wimbledon. Williams added two more WTA Tour titles at Bastad and Toronto, but was upset by Azarenka in a third-set tie-breaker in the Cincinnati final. ""Every time I lose, I get so pumped afterwards,"" said Williams at a pre-tournament press conference Saturday. ""I just feel like now I'm ready, now I'm prepared. I almost needed that to take my game to a new level."" Williams will be 32 on September 26, and if she can retain her title in the final 18 days before that then she will surpass Margaret Court's 1973 effort of being the tournament's oldest woman winner. ""I have been able to keep up with the times,"" Williams said. ""I'm actually serving harder than I ever have in my career. The racquets are stronger and I'm more fit. ""I feel so good, so healthy, so vivacious every time I step on the court."" With world No. 3 Maria Sharapova missing the tournament due to injury, and Wimbledon champion Marion Bartoli having retired earlier this month, Azarenka is Williams' biggest threat along with Polish third seed Agnieszka Radwanska. Williams will face former French Open winner Francesca Schiavone in her opening match Monday, while older sister Venus plays Belgium's Wimbledon semifinalist Kirsten Flipkens. Azarenka will begin the two-week event against Germany's grand slam debutant Dinah Pfizenmaier. ""You can always take the best out of what happened last week, so I will definitely take that into consideration,"" the 24-year-old told reporters Saturday. ""But the new week, U.S. Open, Serena, number one player in the world, defending champion, we all start kind of from zero here."" In the men's draw, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer will both be in action on Monday. Second-ranked Nadal will face American Ryan Harrison as he bids to win the hard-court event for the second time. The Spaniard was champion in 2011, then runner-up the following year, but missed the 2012 event due to injury. Federer, the champion five years in a row from 2004, will play Slovenia's Grega Zemlja as the seventh seed following a difficult year in which the 17-time grand slam winner has struggled with both injuries and an experiment with a new racquet. Meanwhile, world No. 9 Petra Kvitova's U.S. Open preparations stumbled Saturday as the Czech lost 6-2 6-2 to Romania's Simona Halep in the final of the WTA event in New Haven. Halep, a quarterfinalist in Cincinnati, followed up Friday's win over former No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki to claim her fourth title this year. France's Gael Monfils may miss New York after suffering an abdominal injury in the final of the ATP's Winston-Salem tournament. The former world No. 7, now ranked 49th after a series of physical setbacks, retired at 6-3 2-1 down against Austria's Jurgen Melzer.","Serena Williams will begin defense of her U.S. Open title on Monday .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Attempts by the operator of Japan's stricken nuclear power plant to deal with alarming leaks of toxic water are like a game of ""whack-a-mole,"" the country's industry minister said this week. The time has come for the government to step in, Toshimitsu Motegi believes. Report: Fukushima's radiation damaged more souls than bodies . A litany of problems has beset the Fukushima Daiichi power plant since it was crippled by the devastating earthquake and tsunami that struck northeast Japan in 2011. The most troubling at the moment is how to contain the swelling volume of radioactive water flowing from the damaged reactor buildings. Last week another calamity added itself to the catalog of worrying incidents. Read more: Street view shows Fukushima nuclear ghost town . Hundreds of tons of contaminated water leaked from a huge storage tank, one of close to a thousand hulking containers at the plant. Japan's Nuclear Regulation Authority declared the leak a ""serious incident,"" its gravest warning since the 2011 natural disaster triggered a meltdown in three reactors. Weeks ago, plant operator, Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco), admitted that radioactive groundwater was leaking into the Pacific Ocean from the site, bypassing an underground barrier built to seal in the water. 'Whack-a-mole' Tepco said this week that it is taking measures to tackle the problems at the site, including stepping up inspections of the water tanks and other possible sources of leaks. It has transferred the remaining contaminated water from the leaky tank to another container. The company's president, Natomi Hirose, said Monday that it may bring in experts from outside of Japan to help advise the task force that is dealing with the toxic water crisis. Opinion: What Japanese leaders can learn from Fukushima . But the government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, which had already expressed dissatisfaction with Tepco's response, appears to have lost patience. ""Countermeasures led by Tepco to stop the contaminated water leaks have been like a ""whack-a-mole"" arcade game,"" Motegi said Monday after a visit to the plant. ""From now on, the government is going to step forward."" His comments reinforce the words of Abe, who said earlier this month that the contaminated water crisis at the site ""is not an issue where we can let Tepco take complete responsibility."" Abe said the problem had to be dealt with at ""a national level"" and ordered Motegi's ministry to come up with ""multiple, speedy and sure solutions to this issue."" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said Monday that the ministry's measures could draw on the government's reserve funds. But experts say that any potential solutions, such as freezing the ground around the plant or releasing radioactive water into the ocean, are likely to present significant technological and political challenges for the government. Chernobyl visit . Against the backdrop of the toxic water crisis at Fukushima, Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida on Sunday visited Chernobyl in the Ukraine, the site of the worst nuclear accident in history. Kishida and his Ukrainian counterpart pledged cooperation between the two countries on dealing with the aftermath of nuclear disasters, the foreign minister said. Read more: Man who battled Japan's nuclear meltdown dies . The scale of the calamity that unfolded at Fukushima, after the tsunami knocked out cooling systems for the three reactors that were operating at the time, is second only to Chernobyl. Meltdowns and hydrogen explosions spewed radioactive particles across many of the surrounding towns, complicating an already historic disaster. Though no deaths have been directly attributed to the accident, tens of thousands of people from towns as far as 25 miles away have been displaced by the disaster. It crippled Tepco financially, and the government had to bail it out. Meanwhile, problems have continued to arise at the plant. Vast volumes of water . In March, the company said that a rat was believed to have caused a temporary power outage at the facility. In July, Tepco disclosed that water in a test well at the reactor showed concentrations of radioactive tritium in one well as high as 500,000 becquerels -- a unit of radioactive intensity -- per liter of water. By comparison, Japan's maximum safe level of radioactivity in drinking water for adults is 300 becquerels per liter. Vast stands of storage tanks have grown up around the plant as the company struggles to deal with the high volume of tainted water. About 400 tons of groundwater flow through the site each day, and Tepco also pumps large amounts water through the buildings to keep the crippled reactors cool. The tank where the leak was discovered last week was one of about 350 tanks built as temporary storage units in the aftermath of the reactor meltdowns. They are among a total of about 1,000 tanks, 93% of which are already full of radioactive water. Tepco, its regulators and the Japanese government now face the challenge of what to do in the short term with the hundreds of thousands of tons of toxic water stored in tanks similar to the one that leaked. In the longer term, they have to figure out how to deal with all the contaminated water being kept at the plant. And they have to find a way to stop the groundwater from flowing through the site and into the ocean. CNN's Junko Ogura reported from Tokyo, and Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong.","Japan's industry minister says ""the government is going to step forward""
The crippled nuclear plant has been beset by a range of problems .
The most pressing one is dealing with huge volumes of radioactive water .
The Fukushima plant was the site of the worst nuclear accident since 1986 ."
"(CNN) -- Edward Snowden, the former technical assistant for the CIA who has leaked details of a top-secret American program, has checked out of a Hong Kong hotel where he was holed up for three weeks. Where he is now is the subject of intense speculation, as is the question of what happens next. Read more: Called a defector, NSA leaker defends his decision . Analysts say the United States is likely to seek his extradition. But Hong Kong could refuse if the government in Beijing decides it might be useful to keep him, and countries such as Iceland could step in to grant him asylum (although there is no suggestion Snowden has yet applied for asylum there.) By Snowden's own admission, however, all his ""options are bad."" Read more: Concerns about surveillance 'fanciful,' British official says . ""Yes, I could be rendered by the CIA. I could have people come after me. Or any of the third party partners. They work closely with a number of other nations. Or they could pay off the Triads. Any of their agents or assets,"" he told The Guardian newspaper. ""We have got a CIA station just up the road -- the consulate here in Hong Kong -- and I am sure they are going to be busy for the next week. And that is a concern I will live with for the rest of my life, however long that happens to be."" The U.S. signed an extradition treaty with Hong Kong in 1996 just seven months before the then British colony was handed back to Beijing. Hong Kong's extradition laws had previously been governed by the United States-United Kingdom extradition treaty. This new treaty established an agreement under Hong Kong's ""one country, two systems"" that allows Hong Kong autonomy from Beijing in all matters apart from defense and foreign policy. Analysts say Snowden's leaks puts him squarely in the grey area that straddles Hong Kong's autonomy and Beijing's foreign policy. ""This is a huge political statement,"" former CIA operative Robert Baer told CNN. ""He has put himself in serious legal jeopardy. He leaked signals intelligence and the (U.S.) government is almost mandated to go prosecute him. They will not let this go at all."" Obama: No one listening to your calls . He said the U.S. would likely seek an extradition warrant so that Snowden, whom he said was in clear violation of laws governing disclosure of U.S. state secrets, could face felony charges. Baer also surmised that Snowden's timing may have played to Beijing's anger over charges by the U.S. that China's military had hacked into U.S. government and corporate networks. ""Frankly ... I think they're very angry over the hacking charges that have been brought up over the past couple of months,"" he said. ""I think it's no coincidence that this interview was aired just as the Chinese premier was leaving the United States."" A two-day summit between President Obama and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, wrapped up Saturday in California - and the thorny issue of cyber-security was on the agenda. ""If you're going to make a political statement like this so strongly with such evidence, you either do it in Washington DC on Capitol Hill or at worst you go to some place like Sweden or Iceland that isn't in the game on this deal. ""I think we're going to hear a lot more about this as the weeks go on and there's a lot more to it,"" Baer said. Under the Hong Kong-U.S. treaty, both sides have the right of refusal in the case of political offenses. However, under Hong Kong's Fugitives Offenders Ordinance, Beijing has the right of veto over extraditions that could significantly affect defense or foreign affairs. Read more: Who is Edward Snowden? Patricia Ho, a lawyer with Daly & Associates in Hong Kong whose firm has handled asylum and refugee claims, said that given Hong Kong's lackluster track record on granting asylum, she was surprised Snowden had lauded the region for its commitment to civil liberties. Libyan dissident Sami al-Saadi still plans to sue the Hong Kong government for its role in his illegal rendition to and imprisonment in Libya in 2004. ""Within China itself, Hong Kong has better civil liberties but I couldn't see the Hong Kong government granting him asylum given their present practices,"" she said. She said if Snowden pursued an asylum claim within Hong Kong, he would have to establish one of three categories of threat: torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or persecution. The last category is designed to cover ordinary refugees fleeing persecution at home. The case of WikiLeaks source Bradley Manning -- currently in detention in the U.S. - could help Snowden, Ho said. In 2012, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture found that his detention in solitary confinement for 11 months ""constitutes at a minimum cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment in violation of article 16 of the convention against torture."" In this case, Hong Kong could resist extradition unless the US made diplomatic guarantees that Snowden would not meet the same fate as Manning. Whether China, which exerts considerable behind-the-scenes influence in Hong Kong, would put at risk its relationship with the U.S. over Snowden remains to be seen, she said. ""If he does come forward and decides to resist extradition from within Hong Kong then this would become a very fascinating case because it would challenge 'one country, two systems,'"" Ho said. Opinion: Snowden is a hero .","Analysts: U.S. is likely to seek Snowden's extradition, but Beijing has the right of veto .

"(CNN) -- Triathlon has a reputation for being expensive. In fact, the perceived costs are enough to stop some prospective participants from taking up the challenge. There's no doubt that triathlons are harder on the bank balance than other sports, such as running, soccer, baseball or swimming. But believe me when I say that you don't need to max out your credit card to do triathlon, to enjoy triathlon and even to succeed in triathlon. In 2007, I raced my first Ironman on a road bike (not the normal TT bike used for Ironman racing) with regular wheels. I borrowed my friend's race kit, and wore a $20 pair of sunglasses I bought from a gas station in New Zealand three years prior to the race. The most important investment you can make is in the form of hard work, drive and determination. The most important piece of equipment you can have is a huge heart. The most important weapon in triathlon is your mind. 10 ways to act like a champion . Having said that, it's hard to compete in a bike ride without a bike. And race directors are not overly keen on your swimming, biking or running in your birthday suit. So here are a few items that every triathlete, budding or otherwise, needs to be able to train and race in this amazing sport: . Goggles: Leaky, ill-fitting goggles can cause panic and discomfort. If possible, try goggles on before you buy them. They should stay on your face, even without the strap. Your eyelashes shouldn't touch the lenses, and the nose piece shouldn't cut you like a knife. Slightly tinted goggles are best, as they are suitable for both cloudy and sunny conditions. Wetsuit: Wetsuits are mandatory in some races. They help keep you warm and also provide buoyancy. Ideally, your wetsuit should be swim/triathlon specific, rather than a surf wetsuit. You don't need to spend a fortune -- some companies offer one-off, monthly or even season rentals. Just make sure you swim in the wetsuit before race day and learn how to get it on and off properly. It needs to be snug, but not too tight or restrictive. Swimcap: These are usually provided by race organizers, but a spare is useful for training and for doubling up if the water is cold. Bike: You need one, but what kind? Bikes can be few hundred dollars or as much as the price of a car. If you're just starting triathlon and only planning on doing one or two local events, you can use a beach cruiser, shopper or mountain bike. But if you are thinking of doing more, it's probably best to buy a road bike -- which you can train, race and even commute on. Secondhand bikes can be a great value, but it's your responsibility to make sure your bike is roadworthy. Getting a personal ""bike-fit"" from a bike shop is worthwhile. Race day tips from an Ironman champ . Shoes: Whether you use regular or so-called clipless pedals (a bit of a misnomer, as you actually clip into them) will depend on your cycling experience and confidence. Your choice of pedal determines what shoes you wear. Cleated shoes (these lock onto the pedals) are definitely not essential for those new to cycling. With flat pedals you can use the same shoes for cycling and running. Buy a sturdy running shoe that you can trust that suits your form/biomechanics (a good running shop can help with this). Helmet: Of course, helmets are a must, but it doesn't have to be the all-song-and-dance ""aero"" kind. A regular brain bucket will protect your head fine; just make sure it has passed the necessary safety tests. Race suit: You could wear a pair of shorts and a T-shirt under your wetsuit and keep them on until the finish line. But while not essential, opting for a tri suit in a race enables you to wear the same outfit from start to finish. There are basically two options, a single-piece tri suit, or a two-piece shorts and singlet. Tri training: Taking to open water . There are lots of other items that are useful, but not essential, and it's easy to spend far more than you need to succeed. Start with the gear listed here, and then make sure you can use it. Once you fall in love with the sport, and if your wallet can handle the pressure, you may want to add some optional extras or upgrade what you have. But remember, it's not all about the gear. It's about the idea, the plan, the ambition .... the dream.","Champion Chrissie Wellington did her first Ironman using a friend's race kit .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The recovery of a 14-year-old Pakistani girl who was shot in the neck and now breathes on a ventilator hinges on what happens over the next two days. Malala Yousufzai remains in a Rawalpindi hospital after being attacked for simply defending the right of girls to go to school. And police are questioning men with alleged links to the attack. On Friday, an international team of neurological specialists said her condition was stable, but they were watching her closely. Her family waits, and hopes, yet they are afraid to give away where they are exactly. They're terrified that Taliban who would gun down a teenager wouldn't hesitate to come after them. Around the country, supporters gathered for small vigils to pray for her recovery. Government officials in Peshawar, the main city in the northwestern region where Malala is from, were silent for one minute in her honor. Tests on Malala went well, doctors said, and her care at a hospital where she was initially treated was good. She remains in critical condition, but specialists are satisfied with the situation. ""The next 36 to 48 hours are important,"" Major Gen. Asim Bajwa told reporters in Rawalpindi. A Karachi rally is planned for Sunday, and thousands of people are expected to attend. Malala was riding home in a school van Tuesday in the tense and Taliban-heavy Swat Valley when gunmen jumped into the vehicle and demanded to know which girl she was. Her horrified classmates pointed to her, and the men fired. Two other girls were wounded, but not seriously. Brave blogger . Malala gained fame for blogging about how girls should have rights in Pakistan, including the right to learn. She spoke out in a region of the country where support for Islamic fundamentalism runs high. ""I have the right of education,"" she said in a CNN interview last year. ""I have the right to play. I have the right to sing. I have the right to talk. I have the right to go to market. I have the right to speak up."" Malala, whose writing earned her Pakistan's first National Peace Prize, also encouraged young people to take a stand against the Taliban -- and to not hide in their bedrooms. ""God will ask you on the day of judgment where were you when your people were asking you ... when your school fellows were asking you, and when your school was asking you,"" she said in her CNN interview, ""['Why] I am being blown up?'"" The Taliban believes no girl should be educated, and they've threatened that if Malala survives, they will murder her. Despite the threat, some Pakistani schoolgirls are saying Malala's shooting won't stop them from continuing their education. ""In our society, girls don't have rights and they don't get to study, but I think that's completely wrong,"" one of the girls told a CNN reporter. ""I think we have the same rights as men and we will stand up for our rights. And we will go out and encourage all girls to study."" Police make arrests, close in on attackers . Police had earlier detained 200 suspects, but released all but three. Those three gave statements pointing to one suspect. Also Friday, police officer Gul Afzal Afridi said that suspect has not been arrested, but investigators said they strongly believe he played a role in the attack. Though many Pakistanis are appalled by the attack, the Taliban have kept up their vicious comments, saying that they figured shooting the teenager would have an impact in the West. ""We do not tolerate people like Malala speaking against us,"" Taliban spokesman Ihsanullah Ihsan said. 'Malala is Pakistan's daughter' Indeed, the attack did stir global debate. Leaders across the world spoke out, including those in Pakistan. The teenager has come to symbolize a battle between freedom and oppression, violence and peace, a young generation and a group that is hell-bent on keeping Pakistan under the grip of Islamic extremism. ""Malala is Pakistan's daughter, Pakistan's real face, Pakistan's messenger of love and peace,"" Pakistani Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf said. The country is fighting terrorism because it's a ""menace."" On her blog, Malala often wrote about her life in Swat Valley, a hotbed of militant activity. The valley near the Afghanistan border once attracted tourists to Pakistan's only ski resort, as well as visitors to the ancient Buddhist ruins in the area. But that was before militants -- their faces covered -- unleashed a wave of violence. They demanded veils for women, beards for men and a ban on music and television. They allowed boys' schools to operate but closed those for girls. ""We have sacrificed, both man and material and our valiant armed forces, innocent children, citizens, workers and leaders,"" Ashraf said Friday. ""But now the nation is united and we have to unite and stand together to uproot this menace from our motherland and our children."" Speaking in Rawalpindi, Ashraf thanked political leaders and others who have stood up in support of Malala. ""We would together like to give this message to fight against the mindset that attacked her,"" he said. 'Education is the best thing' At Islamabad's Khaldunia High School, students hung banners and wrote letters demanding that the government do everything possible to save Malala. Girls look up to Malala, said one female student whose identity CNN isn't revealing to protect her safety. ""I was really shocked because she was so ambitious ..."" she said. ""I pray for her health."" ""To have the courage to actually go against all that,"" another girl said. ""I think that was quite respectable."" A reporter asked if the attack has inspired them and if they planned to speak up even louder. ""I want these people who attacked her to learn that women are not all bad,"" one girl answered. ""They are basically afraid of giving women equal rights because they're afraid of what women can do because they know they can do a lot. ""I want to speak up so they can learn some lessons from that message."" A boy student said he wanted to study more because of Malala. He won't take going to school for granted anymore, he said. ""What I learned from her is that education is the best thing, and if I get an education, I will be a better person,"" said another boy, 14. A 'barbaric act' President Asif Ali Zardari told Malala's father Friday that he was grieving and in shock over her shooting, and he condemned ""the barbaric act of the militants,"" according to a release from Zardari's office. Pakistani Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar on Thursday called the attempted assassination of Malala ""a wake-up call"" for the nation. Pakistani media reports suggested that the government is considering sending her overseas for treatment, but Bajwa, the military spokesman, said Friday that there is no plan yet to do that. Media inside Pakistan continue to debate how to respond to Malala's shooting. ""Just as the Taliban scare us with terror, we must scare them by making them unable to operate,"" Madiha Afzal, an assistant professor at the University of Maryland who grew up in Pakistan, wrote in an opinion piece published in The Express Tribune. ""We must terrorize them by investing more than ever before in educating girls,"" she said. Former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, now the U.N. special envoy for global education, has traveled to Pakistan and advocated for girls' education there. He said in an editorial published Friday that Zardari has invited him to return in November to lead a delegation of education leaders to come up with ways to improve opportunities for children. ""I have asked Pakistan's President Zardari to pledge that Malala's suffering will not be in vain,"" he wrote. Education a focus on International Day of the Girl .
