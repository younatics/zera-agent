Danica Weeks, the wife of a MH370 passenger, is disgusted by the release of the fictional book about the missing plane just three months after the mysterious disappearance . Furious families of MH370 passengers have slammed a controversial new novel that uses the doomed airliner as a plot line - just three months after the plane vanished on March 8. Danica Weeks, the wife of missing New Zealander Paul Weeks, told the Sydney Morning Herald she was angered and disgusted by Scott Maka's release of the fictional novella, MH370, so soon after the tragedy before knowing all of the facts. ‘I'd rather they'd put their efforts to helping them find the truth, to be honest,"" she said. 'We're going to be spending the rest of our lives doing that.' Maka, who is based in Malaysia, said he never intended for the book's audience to be the relatives of the missing passengers or for them to even find out about it. He said he wasn't writing the piece for the families and wanted to apologise to Ms Weeks. ‘I'm saddened to hear that she's reacted like that, I'm upset that she's upset,' he said. Meanwhile, the relatives of the MH370 passengers won't rest until they have answers about what happened to the plane, even announcing a plan to crowd-fund $5M to 'encourage a whistleblower' to come forward to shed some light on what they believe has become a cover up. Despite Malaysia's plans to send a team to Australia to finalise the next search phase of the missing plane on Tuesday, relatives of passengers have decided to take investigations into their own hands. The Reward MH370 campaign is being spearheaded by an Australian businessman, Ethan Hunt, who lives in Hong Kong but has no connection with any of the passengers. Despite intensive aviation and police investigations, authorities have been unable to explain why the plane carrying 239 passengers made a sudden turn westward and vanished. Danica Weeks, right, with her husband Paul Weeks who was aboard the MH370 that vanished on March 8 . MH370 a novella, released by Scott Maka, has hit a nerve with relatives of the passengers . Sarah Bajc, whose partner Philip Wood was on board, said families wanted to look at the tragedy with ‘a fresh set of eyes’. ‘Governments and agencies have given it their best shot but have failed to turn up a single shred of evidence, either because of a faulty approach or due to intentional misdirection by one or more individuals.’ Ms Bajc said. Ms Weeks agreed that they had been left with no choice. ‘We’ve been cut off so many times at the gate that we’re just now having to take things into our own hands, think outside the box and just try and do something to find this plane,’ she said. Meanwhile, a New Zealand oil rig worker, who claimed to have seen 'MH370 on fire' over the South China Sea, revealed today that he had lost his job for reporting the incident. Speaking for the first time about the sighting of a 'burning aircraft' and the loss of his job, Mike McKay remained positive about the contents of an email he had sent, in which he said: 'I believe I saw the Malaysian Airlines plane come down. The timing is right.' And he said that the ongoing search for the missing airliner raised many unanswered questions, adding: 'The investigators do not inspire trust.' Mr McKay was working on the Songa Mercur oil rig off the southern coast of Vietnam on the night of March 8 when he saw what he believed was a burning plane. Mr McKay sent an email to his employers, which in turn was leaked to the media who gained access to his name, place of work, the rig operator, Idemitsu, as well as McKay's contractor and rig owner Songa Offshore. A New Zealand oil rig worker lost his job for reporting that he claimed to have seen Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 on fire . Mike McKay claimed to have seen the aircraft 'burning' while it was flying over the South China Sea . The email address was inundated with so many inquiries that the operators' communications became blocked. 'This became intolerable for them and I was removed from the rig and not invited back,' he told New Zealand's Sunday Star Times. He said that although he was paid up until the end of his work period, he was released from the rig five days earlier. Mr McKay, a drilling fluids consultant who has worked mostly in South East Asia for the past 35 years - the last six almost continuously in Vietnam waters - is now looking for more work. In his email, Mr McKay gave what appeared to be credible details of a burning plane. He described his exact location on the oil rig, the compass bearing of where the aircraft was in relation to the rig, the approximate distance of the plane from the rig, the current on the water surface and the wind direction. The plane, he said in the email, was not on the normal flight path scheduled jets flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing took - a fact he knew because 'we see the contrails every day.' Mr McKay signed off his email with a 'good luck', followed by his full name and New Zealand passport number. After reading the email, Vietnamese authorities interviewed the New Zealander and started an initial search - but two days after speaking to him the search in the South China Sea was called off when the hunt for MH370 switched to the Andaman Sea and then to the southern part of the Indian Ocean . Since then, he said, neither the Malaysian nor Australian search teams had contacted him. Malaysia will send a team of experts to Australia on Tuesday to prepare to the next effort of the search phase . The latest information and analysis confirms that MH370 will be found in close proximity to the arc set out in this map and labelled as the 7th arc. At the time MH370 reached this arc, the aircraft is considered to have exhausted its fuel and to have been descending. As a result, the aircraft is unlikely to be more than 20 NM (38 km) to the west or 30 NM (55 km) to the east of the arc. The 7th arc: The seventh arc on this globe is the area where MH370 is thought to be. The arc was determined by measuring the time difference between communication messages sent between MH370 and an Inmarsat satellite . Just last week, British yachtswoman Katherine Tee, 41, reported seeing an airliner on fire on the same night as Mr McKay's 'burning plane' - but she was in a totally different area, sailing east from southern India to Phuket in southern Thailand. She told of seeing a plane surrounded by bright orange lights, leaving a trail of smoke as it pased above her.Mr McKay told the New Zealand paper that his sighting placed the aircraft around 2000kms (1200 miles) from the location of Ms Tee. He said he was unsure if MH370 could have even flown that far while suffering such an obvious and devastating fire, asking: 'How far can a burning aeroplane fly?' A new and potentially deeper underwater search taking up to 12 months will begin in August, with a formal request for tender to undertake the search to soon be released, according to The Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre. Meanwhile, a Chinese vessel is currently conducting a bathymetric survey - or mapping of the ocean floor - to help experts determine how to carry out the next stage of the search on the previously unmapped ocean seabed. Recently, there have been many claims of knowledge about the whereabouts of the missing Malaysia Airlines flight. Curtin University in Western Australia released information that an underwater sound recorded just 10 minutes after the plane lost contact with air traffic control could have been the plane crashing into the water. However, Dr Alec Duncan from the University said there is only a 10 percent chance the 'dull oomph' was actually MH370. And a British sailor reported she spotted what she believed to be a plane on fire with black smoke trailing behind it while on a 13 month expedition with her husband. Katherine Tee said she didn't say anything at the time as she was the only one who spotted it and didn't realise it's potential relevance. Relatives of the 239 passengers and crew were recently successful in demanding Inmarsat publicly release its data, after losing faith that searchers were looking in the right area. Meanwhile, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau sparked renewed hope in the search for MH370, saying  a study completed after the 2009 Air France crash concluded that the majority of aircraft in loss-of-control accidents were found within 32km of their last known position. This provides a reasonable limitation for the size of the search area across the arc. The satellite data indicates the Boeing 777 flew for six hours after falling off radar screens.","Danica Weeks, the wife a passenger aboard the MH370, is 'disgusted' by the release of a fictional book on the mysterious jet .

"By . Martin Robinson . Upset: Nail technician Carissa Grice used a mobile to check Facebook while abroad and was handed a bill for £3,000 . A teenager who wanted to stay in touch with friends on Facebook while on holiday was left 'devastated' after she was sent a shock bill for almost £3,000. Carissa Grice, 18, used the Orange mobile, which is in her mother Ellen's name, while they were on a fortnight's break together in Antalya, Turkey. The teenager, from Greater Manchester, was using Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp to chat to friends, downloading 630MB of data, and managed to rack up a bill for £2,907 last month. She believed she was on the hotel's WiFi, but was also charged by Orange at £8 per MB because her data roaming was also on, she said. Miss Grice said: 'When I got the bill I was in complete shock - I couldn't speak. I just kept saying I'm in debt, I can't afford to pay it. 'They need to warn people and be open about the costs of roaming. When I spoke to them I said ""I haven't called anyone, I haven't sent any texts, it can't be right"". 'I work in a salon and you hear so many stories like mine where people have had a shock bill. It's ridiculous'. Her father Rob, 43, said Carissa was in tears when she got home to discover the bill. 'She was devastated. She is a trainee nail technician and on the minimum wage but I told her she was going to have to pay because we couldn't afford to. 'The thing is that if she had sent the same amount of data in texts, rather than using the internet, the bill would have been more like £350. It's unfair'. Cry for help: The 18-year-old tweeted in the days after returning that she was going to have to pay the debt . Holiday: Carissa with with her mum Ellen in Antalya where surfing the internet costs £8 per MB with Orange . Mr Grice said he bought a data bundle before they went abroad 'but it clearly wasn't enough'. In shock: Miss Grice said Orange and other companies should do better at warning about roaming costs . He added that Orange shut off the phone and contacted her daughter when the bill hit £1,000, part-way through the holiday, only to tell her that there was a mix-up and it was reactivated again. They then contacted her again on the day she came back, when the bill was now at £2,907, he said. Mr Grice added: 'I think there should be a cap, there are with other networks. She has a £30 a month contract, when anyone's bill hits double that they should be contacted in my view, not when it reaches £1,000.' Orange said today it had sent texts to the phone to point out the data use, and had demanded the bill to be paid. But it has since decided to slash it to around £250. A spokesman told the Daily Telegraph: 'In this instance, Mrs Grice purchased a bundle which was not big enough for her usage. As a gesture of goodwill, we’ve recalculated her bill with the most appropriate bundles applied'. It is not the first case of this kind for Orange. A teacher has told of how she ended up with a £2,600 bill after downloading a Neil Diamond album while on holiday in South Africa. Katie Bryan, a maths teacher from Lighthorne, Warwickshire, was visiting her South African-born boyfriend’s family when she downloaded the music to her iPhone via iTunes. Katie Bryan, 43, from Lighthorne, Warwickshire, downloaded a £8.99 'best of' Neil Diamond album while on holiday in South Africa which ended up costing her of £2,609.31 . Contact . your network operator before you leave: Often they have cheaper bundles . or tariffs available if you know you're going abroad . Ask if your network can put a cap on the amount of internet you use, to stop your bill spiraling. Turn off auto-updating of apps or email retrieval: Again this means you won't use any data allowance . Use mobile websites instead of full desktop view: This will save data per page . Turn off data roaming all together: If you don't want to use the internet when you're away . When the 43-year-old returned to the UK, she discovered that her bank account was more than £2,000 overdrawn as a result of a direct debit to phone company Orange of £2,609.31. The multiple-track ‘best of’ CD of the . legendary American singer-songwriter's greatest hits for £8.99, ended up . costing her £2,609.31 . Ms Bryan said: ‘I'd had a bit of wine but not too much. I'm really not that big a Neil Diamond fan. 'I think Orange is preying on people who make a mistake while abroad. 'There is no way this huge bill relates to the actual cost to Orange. ‘You hear of people doing this and you think ""stupid person - why did you do that?"" I do feel foolish. ‘But I also feel it is morally wrong to be expected to pay this sort of money for a Neil Diamond album’ Orange agreed to cut her bill to £400 and apologised.

Signed in 2006 as a 17-year-old, Vela was tipped for big things by Arsene Wenger but never reached his potential at the club. Relegated to playing on the left wing, and sent out on loan to four different clubs, Vela scored just 11 times for the first team in six years at Arsenal. However, with the Gunners boss looking to buy strikers as back-up to front man Olivier Giroud, Vela has become a target for Wenger.","Mexican striker Vela joined Arsenal in 2006 but failed to break through .

"By . Jill Reilly . A video has captured the horrific moment dozens of African migrants on the verge of being rescued capsized in their dingy leaving three of them dead. Italian authorities say three migrants have died at sea and at least two are still missing after they attempted to board a Maltese tanker from a dinghy crammed with people. A police video shows the dinghy capsizing as migrants begin climbing up the steps to the tanker and the remaining migrants tumbling into the sea. Scroll down for video . A video has captured the horrific moment African migrants on the verge of being rescued capsized in their dingy killing three . The migrants, all wearing life jackets, try to scramble towards the tanker. The merchant tanker Norient Star recovered three bodies and took onboard a total of 700 migrants from various vessels, a navy statement said. The tanker then docked at the Sicilian port of Pozzallo on Monday, where police were waiting with coffins for the deceased. Italy has rescued about 5,200 men, women and children and recovered three dead bodies from overcrowded boats in the Mediterranean Sea since early Thursday. Calm seas have led to this latest wave of migrants who have left North African shores for Italy over just three days, a navy spokesman told Reuters, with merchant ships and a Maltese vessel also aiding in the rescue efforts. The surge in arrivals is straining the ability of the Italian naval mission - called Mare Nostrum or 'Our Sea' - to patrol the waters between Africa and Italy on its own. It has prompted local officials in Sicily, where most of the migrants are taken, to call for more European support. 'Europe can't just turn its back on us,' Lillo Firetto, mayor of the Sicilian port city of Porto Empedocle, said in a television interview on Sunday. 'This isn't just Sicily's border, but it's Europe's border, too.' Italian authorities say three migrants have died at sea and at least two are still missing after they attempted to board a Maltese tanker from a dinghy crammed with people . The migrants, all wearing life jackets, try to scramble towards the tanker, but it starts to tip . The merchant tanker Norient Star recovered three bodies and took onboard a total of 700 migrants from various vessels, a navy statement said . Italy has rescued around 5,200 men, women and children from overcrowded boats in the Mediterranean Sea since early Thursday . Italy has repeatedly asked for more European Union countries to join Mare Nostrum, which is Europe's biggest ever search-and-rescue mission, but so far only Slovenia has chipped in, offering one ship for two months late last year. Mare Nostrum began last October after 366 migrants fleeing African countries drowned when their boat capsized a mile from Sicily. After the tragedy, the EU pledged 30 million euros ($40.85 million) in emergency funding, mainly targeted to fund immigration facilities on land. The number of boat migrants who have reached Italy this year has already topped the total of more than 40,000 for the whole of 2013. The pace of arrivals is on track to exceed the record of 62,000 set in 2011 during the Arab Spring uprisings. Two-thirds of the migrants, who come from dozens of countries and include Syrians fleeing civil war and Eritreans evading military conscription, leave Italy for other EU countries, the Interior Ministry said. 'The ones who arrived yesterday left immediately. We saw them walking down state-road 115,' Firetto said in the televisions interview. Given the thousands who have arrived in just the past few days, Firetto said he was very worried that the situation would get worse in coming weeks. Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has urged the United Nations to intervene in Libya, where criminal gangs charge migrants more than $1,000 each for a spot on unsafe vessels, to try to limit the departures. The recent flood of boat migrants has helped revive Italy's anti-immigrant Northern League party, which had lost much of its support over the last two years due to corruption scandals and leadership changes.","Dinghy capsizies as migrants begin climbing up the steps to the tanker .

"By . Amanda Williams . The boyfriend of a woman who died after a two year battle with cancer stole more than £3,000 she left for her five-year-old daughter. Mark Hibberd also took over £1,200 raised through charity events for the daughter of his 'soulmate' Suzanne Clarkson, who died aged just 30. Hibberd, 46, started a relationship with Suzanne in 2008 but she was diagnosed with breast cancer soon after and died in July 2010, Leeds Crown Court heard. Thief: Mark Hibberd who stole more than £3,000 from the estate of his late girlfriend Suzanne Clarkson. He also took over £1,200 raised through charity events for her daughter, five . He claimed he regarded her as his ‘soulmate’. But the court heard he took money she inherited and transferred it to his own bank account. His partner's family also asked Hibberd to safeguard money raised for her daughter through a series of community fundraisers but he also took some of that. Hibberd, of Hemsworth, West Yorkshire, admitted two counts of theft and was jailed for eight months, suspended for a year, at Leeds Crown Court. Mitigating, Dan Smith said: 'He is deeply ashamed and wants to put things right. He is genuinely sorry.' Hibberd was also ordered to complete 200 hours community work. Victim: Hibberd, 46, started a relationship with Suzanne Clarkson (pictured) in 2008 but she was diagnosed with breast cancer soon after and died in July 2010, Leeds Crown Court heard . Judge Tom Bayliss QC told him: 'You suffered a bereavement in 2010 of someone described as your soulmate. 'And what you did for your soulmate was to steal the money she had destined for her five-year-old daughter. 'To compound matters, you stole money people in the community had put a lot of time in to raising for that same daughter.' After the case Suzanne’s mother Lorraine Clarkson, 60, of Hemsworth, said: 'We don’t care what happens to him. Hibberd claimed he regarded her as his 'soulmate'. But the court heard he took money she inherited and transferred it to his own bank account . 'It was never about prison it was just about getting the money back that is owed to our granddaughter.' She added that her daughter had suffered from cancer previously and was in remission when it returned. She said: 'When she first had cancer doctors said she would make a full recovery. She finished treatment and had reconstruction surgery but then she got poorly again. 'She kept it from us for a couple of months because her dad was ill in hospital. She was worried about him and I don’t think she wanted to tell us that she was getting ill again. 'Suzanne was a popular, well-liked young woman. She was always bubbly and she really cared about the people around her.'","Mark Hibberd, 46, started a relationship with Suzanne Clarkson in 2008 .

A Missouri family is speaking out about being forced to spend all their savings to fix a new home that partiers broke into and trashed just hours after they closed on the place. The Kaiser family was horrified when they got to their new home to find it covered in urine, vomit, and cigarette burns. And their discoveries only got worse. The Kaisers would soon find damages to the house they'd bought move-in ready that amounted to $30,000. Trashed: A Missouri couple's new home was completely trashed by partiers who broke in just hours after they closed on the place . Filthy: The four bedroom home was ready for Curtis Kaiser and his family to move in when they bought it but the next time the showed up, there were cigarette burns in every floor, holes in the wall and filth everywhere . Ruined: Floors were ruined throughout the home and the Kaisers, who'd only just bought the place, started draining their savings and putting materials on credit cards to fix the place back up . That's without labor costs. Curtis Kaiser, a home contractor, told KTVI that he's done all the work himself. 'They urinated in cabinets,' revealed Kaiser. 'There’s cigarette burns all over all the floors, the carpets, the laminates, I mean there was alcohol spilled everywhere, there was vomit all over the place, and they broke the handrails up the stairs.' The Kaisers hauled three Dumpsters worth of cast off booze bottles and other filth from the home. Because the Affton home was outfitted with custom windows and kitchen cabinets, the Kaisers had to replace every cabinet and window--even the non-damaged ones. But the costly damage didn't end there. The partiers did damage to the actual structure of the home, as well. Pricey: Homeowner Curtis Kaiser happens to be a contractor and the family spent around $30,000 on materials alone as he did all the construction work himself . Custom job: Because the windows were custom made for the home, Kaiser had to replace all of them, not just the damaged ones . 'I guess a whole bunch of people got out there, and it caved in, and so we had to replace the flat part of the roof, too,' 'It’s been close to $30,000, probably, and that’s just materials and buying stuff, and that’s just with me doing all the work,' he told KTVI. Adding insult to injury, one girl from the party even returned to the home to get something she'd left. 'Some girl showed up in our driveway wanting to get her beer pong table back from the party,' recalled a very annoyed Kaiser. The St. Louis County police say they're actively investigating the incident and that they have several persons of interest. Insult to injury: One partygoer even returned to the home and asked Kaiser for her beer pong table back . The Kaisers hauled three Dumpsters full of trash out of the home that was left by partygoers . While authorities have released no names of suspects, the Kaisers--who say they've seen photos of and conversations about the party on Facebook--believe a former occupant of the home has something to do with it. The timing of the break-in, right after the Kaisers closed, appears to support that hunch. If found, police could charge suspects with trespassing and burglary, though that won't help the Kaisers get back their savings or pay down credit cards. To receive any financial restitution, the family will have to file a civil lawsuit.","Partiers wrecked the Affton, Missouri home just hours after Curtis Kaiser and family closed on the home .

"By . Julian Robinson . A call girl and her boyfriend murdered a former history teacher for money then proudly took 'selfies' as he lay dead, a court heard. Kirsty Edmondson, 23, and 35-year old Christopher Sawyers used mobiles phones to take 'trophy photos' and had sex in Kenneth Chapman’s bed while they lived with his body for up to a week at his flat in Eccles, Greater Manchester, it was said. The pair also stole his television and computer and raided his bank account in a string of online frauds - and even texted the victim’s unwitting sister pretending to be 47-year old Mr Chapman asking if she could lend him £75, the court heard. Kirsty Edmondson, pictured left, and Christopher Sawyers, right, are accused of murdering former history teacher Kenneth Chapman and then taking 'twisted selfies' Police were called in and found Mr Chapman, pictured, dead at his flat in Eccles, Greater Manchester with tests showing he had been injected with a lethal dose of heroin . Later Sawyers allegedly showed one of the photos to his friends saying: 'Look at this. I will show you a photo of a corpse.' Police were called in and found Mr Chapman dead at his flat with tests showing he had been injected with a lethal dose of heroin. The pair deny murder. Manchester Crown Court was told Sawyers had realised there was 'money to be made out of murder' after he got away with killing a former accountant with the same drug - 17 months before Mr Chapman’s death. Tony Cross QC prosecuting said: 'They treated Kenneth Chapman’s home and property as their exclusive preserve. 'In the 15 days between the death of Mr Chapman and the discovery of his body these two defendants began to steal what they could from him - his TV, computer and from his bank account to purchase goods using a variety of different fraudulent methods. 'They even texted his sister pretending to be him to borrow money. These were callous and despicable actions. 'They began within hours of Kenneth Chapman’s death and continued for days as the two defendants lived in the flat carrying on their lives whilst Mr Chapman lay dead. 'So twisted were their actions that they even took selfies of them enjoying themselves in the very same room as the cadaver. 'These photos are trophy photos - two people proud of their work. Kirsty Edmondson, pictured left and right, and co-accused Christopher Sawyers stole Mr Chapman's television and computer and raided his bank account in a string of online frauds, the court was told . 'They had sex in his bed and filmed it. They stole and committed fraud. Attempts were made to order goods via Amazon, top up mobile phones and pay forged cheques into Sawyers’ bank account. 'This was how they lived their lives - using his home, car and property as their own. They did so because as Christopher Sawyers was later to tell witnesses - he wanted to ""off"" him. To kill him. To end his life.' Earlier, the jury was told how Mr Chapman - who was also a former soldier - had been a keen runner who kept a diary of his daily fitness activities. But he went to prison, lost his teaching job and after his release met Edmondson when he became embroiled in the drugs scene and began associating with call girls for company. He made £18,000 from the sale of his house and moved into rented accommodation and was believed to be contemplating a permanent move back to Scotland after visiting his family over Christmas last year. But tragedy struck on December 28 2013 after he met up with Edmondson and Sawyers and they went back to his flat whey they took drugs and when the victim fell unconscious he was administered with a lethal dose. Mr Cross said: 'Christopher Sawyers and Kirsty Edmondson were acting together. They were clearly in a relationship. It might not have been a relationship of a conventional type. It may not have been born of love or even affection, but of necessity. 'They were . in a relationship and they were acting together both before and after . the murder. What is clear is that Sawyers and Edmondson injected Chapman . with a large dose of heroin, despite his comatose and intoxicated . state, and they did so without his consent. 'They did so because as Christopher Sawyers was later to tell witnesses - he wanted to ""off"" him. To kill him. To end his life.' Less than an hour after Mr Chapman is believed to have been killed, the pair were caught on CCTV driving around Salford in his car where they also attempted to withdraw £100 from his bank account. Later on New Year’s Eve the lovers went to the house of a friend who noticed that Edmondson had a ‘terrible cut’ on her arm, the court heard. A woman took photos of the cut but it prompted Sawyers to say, 'if you think that is unattractive, look at this. I will show you a photo of a corpse.' The couple moved out of the property on January 3 and Mr Chapman’s body was found on January 12. Police later spoke to a witness who said she had overheard overheard Sawyers talking to Edmondson about Mr Chapman saying: 'We can’t keep taking him for bits, we need to see him off. This is taking too long, we need to OD him.' A Home Office pathologist later revealed that the morphine concentration in Mr Chapman’s body was the highest he had ever encountered in deaths from misuse of heroin. The court heard Sawyer was also responsible for the death of former accountant Peter Clark, 60, who also drifted in the Manchester drugs scene. Kirsty Edmondson, pictured left and right, and Christopher Sawyers used mobiles phones to take 'trophy photos' and had sex with each other in Kenneth Chapman's bed whilst they lived with his body, jurors were told . He suffered a fatal collapse whilst he and Sawyers were taking heroin at a house in Ancoats, Manchester on July 5 2012. He was pronounced dead on arrival at Manchester Royal Infirmary. After Mr Clark’s death Sawyers ‘took ownership’ of his phone, topping it up £20 using the dead man’s debit card the following day to call his friends. In the weeks after the death, he is alleged to have told friends that he diluted the heroin with water and ‘dug’ Mr Clark in the hand - referring to an injection, jurors were told. Police at the time went to Mr Clark’s home in Withington to find Sawyers and another woman inside the property. Sawyers was using a computer which had been placed on the coffee table and officers also noticed Mr Clark’s wallet was open with no money in it. He was arrested by police at the time and questioned, but no action further action was taken against him. Sawyers denies murdering Mr Chapman and pleads not guilty to the manslaughter of Mr Clark. Edmondson denies murdering Mr Chapman. The trial continues.

"By . Tara Brady . A bride has been left 'heartbroken' after her handmade engagement ring was stolen on her wedding day - as she said her vows. The thief swiped a black handbag containing the sapphire and diamond-encrusted platinum band from a secluded village church in Sussex as Caroline Marshall, 32, and James Granshaw, 29, tied the knot. Distraught family members said the bride was left in floods of tears when she realised her beloved ring was missing following the service on Saturday afternoon. Stolen ring: Newlyweds Caroline Marshall, 32, and James Granshaw, 29, on their wedding day during which the bride's hand-made £6,000 engagement ring was stolen . They are desperately trying to track down the £6,000 ring, which they say has 'priceless' sentimental value as it was lovingly hand-designed by her husband at an ethical London jewellers. James’ father Mervyn, a retired airline pilot from Guildford, said: 'It is just appalling to do this to a bride on her wedding day. 'This was not a drive-by or a walk-by theft, someone has walked up to the church and targeted it. I just despair. To steal a bride’s engagement ring from a church - how low can you go? 'It put a cloud over the whole day. They are totally heartbroken at what has happened. We are trying to reassure them, but Caroline has been in floods of tears on her honeymoon because she is so upset.' Theft: The couple are desperately trying to track down the £6,000 ring which they say has 'priceless' sentimental . value . James, a qualified barrister and legal adviser at Waverley Borough Council, spent months painstakingly researching ethical jewellers to design an engagement ring that did not contain so-called ‘blood diamonds’ - which are mined in conflict zones - and only used ethical materials. He even helped to design the 'irreplaceable' ring himself. After getting engaged on the snowy ski slopes in Switzerland in 2012, the couple and their family and friends gathered at the parish church of St Peter and Vincula in Wisborough Green, West Sussex last Saturday for the nuptials. However, moments before the ceremony was due to start, Caroline, who works in compliance for an investment firm in the City of London, realised she still had her engagement ring on. She slipped it off her finger and gave it to her best friend and bridesmaid, who put it in her black LK Bennett handbag for safekeeping. After the service they realised the ring was missing and called the police. The stolen handbag also had an iphone in it. The frantic couple were able to track the device for a couple of hours and saw it was making off towards Haywards Heath before the signal went dead that evening. Caroline and James have jetted off for a two week honeymoon in the borders of Tuscany, Italy, but their family say the theft 'blighted' what should have been the happiest day of their lives. Mervyn, 60, said: 'The bridesmaid feels so guilty - it is her best friend. My son and Caroline have gone on their honeymoon, but it has cast a huge shadow over the day. 'The engagement ring is unique. It is not worth £10million, but it has huge sentimental value. 'James put in a lot of effort to create that ring because he knew she would appreciate it. They go to great lengths to make sure it is ethical. It is not some off the shelf ring, it took months of organisation and she loved it. Now it is gone.' Crime scene: After getting engaged in Switzerland in 2012 the couple married at St Peter and Vincula in Wisborough Green in West Sussex on Saturday. But a thief swiped the ring during the service . The couple fear the thief intends to sell their prize possession to one of the dozens of famous jewellery shops in the Lanes in Brighton, and they are urging anyone who has any information about the ring to get in touch. A Facebook page called ‘Help us find the ring’ has been set up to help the search and has received almost 200 likes, and friends and family are using the Twitter hashtag carolinesring. A spokesman for Sussex police said: 'We have searched the grounds of the church but have found no trace of the bag or any of its contents. 'We have been able to trace the movement of the iPhone's signal to the centre of Brighton but do not know where it or the ring have ended up. 'The ring is very distinctive so we hope that if someone is offered the chance to buy it in particular they will recognise it as stolen. 'The memory of the theft will scar the bride's wedding day so we want to at least partially rectify this by reuniting her with her engagement ring.' Anyone with information is asked to contact Mervyn Granshaw on mervyng@mac.com. To contact the police call 101 quoting serial 1265 of 7/6, email 101@sussex.pnn.police.uk or call the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.","Caroline Marshall, 32, and James Granshaw, 29, were married on Saturday .

"By . Julian Robinson . The father of England star Rickie Lambert has been sacked from his job after breaking a glass panel on a drinks machine. Ray Lambert, 54, was sacked after he says he accidentally broke the panel while trying to retrieve a £1 cup of coffee. The father-of-three was escorted out of clothing giant Matalan’s distribution warehouse in Knowsley, Merseyside by security guards last week. Ray Lambert, father of England and Liverpool star Rickie Lambert, at his home in Kirkby, Merseyside. He has been sacked from his job after breaking a glass panel on a drinks machine . The father of Rickie Lambert, pictured arriving in Brazil ahead of the World Cup, has been fired from his warehouse job, it has been revealed . A former workmate said Ray is due to fly out to Brazil next week with wife Maureen, 57, to watch his son in action at the World Cup. He was said to be ‘fuming’ over his dismissal from his £20,000-a-year job and is considering an appeal. The former colleague, who asked not to be named, said: 'It's a joke. Loads of people give that machine a nudge when it doesn’t work properly. 'But to sack him for something as trivial as that was pathetic. 'Ray’s worked at that warehouse ever since it opened. He had put his money into the vending machine to buy the coffee but the cup got lodged in the machine. 'He gave it a little shove to try and dislodge it but accidentally broke the glass panel.'It wasn’t done with any malice. It had got stuck and he was trying to get it out.' But Matalan said there had been 'substantial damage to company property'. Matalan, where Mr Lambert worked, say 'substantial damage' was caused to company property (file picture) A Matalan spokeswoman said: 'Matalan confirms that an employee was recently dismissed from the company following an act of gross misconduct involving substantial damage to company property. 'Matalan takes its responsibility as an employer very seriously and has conducted this dismissal in accordance with the company’s disciplinary policy.' Mr Lambert is understood to have worked for Matalan for ten years, first at the company’s headquarters at Skelmersdale and then at the Knowsley warehouse. The couple live in a modest terraced home less than half a mile from the warehouse.The colleague added: 'He didn’t deliberately smash the glass. 'He’s got lots of friends at the warehouse and is popular among his colleagues. Ray Lambert and his wife Maureen are due to fly out to Brazil to watch their son Rickie Lambert, pictured with the ball against England's recent clash with Ecuador . 'He likes to work even though his son his a millionaire and he doesn’t have to. 'Rickie may have just signed to Liverpool for £4m but Ray has always been keen to stand on his own two feet. 'He and Maureen are desperately proud of what Rickie has achieved and I am sure that this will not destroy their trip to the World Cup.' Lambert signed a two-year-deal with Liverpool FC earlier this month. His parents plan to fly out to Brazil to watch him play in England’s last two group games against Uruguay and Costa Rica. Mr Lambert refused to comment about his sacking.","Ray Lambert accidentally broke panel trying to retrieve a £1 cup of coffee .

"By . Rob Davies, City Correspondent . and Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Energy suppliers were accused of ‘naked greed’ last night and told they must explain why falling gas and electricity prices are not being passed on to consumers. In a public rebuke to the ‘Big Six’ power suppliers, industry regulator Ofgem said they needed to win back the trust of the public. It said customers should be told why bills have not come down when the price suppliers pay has fallen  ‘significantly’ after one of the mildest winters on record. Failure to come up with an answer would be seen as a sign that the energy market is not competitive, it suggested. The price energy companies pay for gas on the wholesale market has fallen from around 70p per therm in December to just 37.55p yesterday . Ofgem’s intervention triggered fresh allegations that power firms are profiteering by raising bills as soon as costs go up, but taking their time to cut them when costs go down. Labour, whose leader Ed Miliband has promised to freeze energy bills if he wins the General Election, leapt on Ofgem’s comments, saying power firms were ‘up to their old tricks’. The TUC also accused the six – British Gas, nPower, E.On, Scottish Power, SSE and EDF – of ‘naked greed’ and ‘taking their customers for a ride’. Figures from Ofgem show that the price of buying gas for delivery the next day is 38 per cent lower than this time last year. Even the longer-term gas contracts typically used by large energy suppliers are 16 per cent below last year. For electricity, short-term prices are 23 per cent lower than last year, while longer-term contracts are 9 per cent lower. Labour leader Ed Miliband has promised to freeze bills for 20 months if he wins the next election . Factories and major users of energy will be paid to cut their power use under a plan to keep the lights on. National Grid has announced measures to deal with the potential energy crunch over the next two winters. Payments will be made to large energy users which can reduce their power use - for example by switching to back-up generation - during peak evening hours in winter. The scheme will be voluntary, and will ultimately help to save consumers' money by preventing the need to build additional power plants to meet peak demand, National Grid said. The operator also announced measures to secure reserves from power stations which would otherwise be closed or mothballed. Peter Bingham, leading this initiative on behalf of National Grid, said: 'It's our job as electricity system operator to make sure we've got all the right tools at our disposal to balance supply and demand on the electricity network, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.' But the average dual fuel bill has risen by £53 since last year to reach £1,265, according to energy comparison website uSwitch.com. Fellow comparison site energyhelpline.com said its research showed that power firms could slash £77 off the average bill if they wanted to, thanks to wholesale price falls. But power firms said allegations that they were squeezing consumers for the sake of profit were wide of the mark. ‘We buy our gas well in advance, so movements in wholesale prices, up or down, do not feed through immediately to retail prices,’ said Ian Peters, residential energy boss at British Gas. ‘We are certainly not increasing profits on the back of lower wholesale gas prices – our trading statement last month downgraded profit expectations.’ Industry body Energy UK said: ‘All energy suppliers aim to hold costs as low as possible for as long as possible.’ Ofgem chief executive Dermot Nolan said: ‘In a competitive market the threat of losing market share would encourage suppliers to reduce their customers’ bills whenever there are sustained reductions in costs.’ He said energy firms ‘need to take the initiative and explain clearly what impact falling wholesale energy costs will have on their pricing policies’. Energy Secretary Ed Davey said energy suppliers should ‘think very carefully and ensure that they pass savings as quickly as possible to their customers’. But Labour shadow energy minister Tom Greatrex said: ‘Yet again it looks like energy companies are up to their old tricks while David Cameron does nothing to stop them.’ The . simplest, and often best, way to slash your energy bills is to use an online . service that can compare all the best tariffs on offer for you.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Once famous for their stiff upper lip, Britons have succumbed to an epidemic of ‘oversharing’ thanks to a steady diet of X Factor sob stories and revealing Facebook posts. A survey of 1,000 adults shows that the natural British reserve has been eroded when it comes to talking about previously taboo subjects such as sex. Growing numbers are prepared to spill the beans on personal issues in a way that would have horrified previous generations. The study revealed that one in four people think Britain is a nation of oversharers. Blame Jeremy: Confessional television chat shows such as The Jeremy Kyle Show are to blame for Brits now sharing more than their parents' generation . Many have been influenced by seeing celebrities openly discuss their addictions or depression, confessional television such as The Jeremy Kyle Show or back stories on talent shows. More than half (51 per cent) say they are more likely to talk about the topic they rated the most blush-inducing of all - sex - than their parents would have been at the same age. But even six in ten (57 per cent) of today’s over 60s, many of whom grew up in the liberated sixties, are more open to talking about sex than previous generations. More than one in three (38 per cent) Brits are more open to discussing personal health problems than their parents were when young. Seeing celebrities such as Cheryl Cole open up about their emotional issues or troubled pasts have also led to 'oversharing' Yet it is money which remains one of the most awkward areas of discussion for many, with many unwilling to tell others how much they earn, for instance. Only 29 per cent felt they are more likely to raise the subject than an older generation. A spokesman for laundry brand Surcare, who commissioned the survey, said: ‘As increasing numbers of people turn to social media to chat to friends and share their innermost thoughts in the public domain, it’s no surprise that a quarter of people feel we are now so comfortable tackling sensitive subjects that we have actually become a nation of oversharers. ‘Reality TV reinforces the idea that there’s something to gain from sharing sensitive information about yourself. ‘And social media is making it easier than ever for people to do so without having to deal with the embarrassment of a face to face conversation.’","Personal trouble and sex are no longer taboo subjects for Brits .

The company said it was notifying owners of vehicles involved in a 2013 safety recall, including 766,300 in the U.S., to replace airbag inflators. Previously, it asked dealers to inspect the airbags and only replaced those judged to be faulty. The recall involves about 20 Toyota . models, including some Corolla compacts and Tundra pickups made in . 2003-2004 and some 2002-2004 Lexus SC 430 coupes.

Of the total number of vehicles affected by the current recall, 650,000 are in Japan and 1.62million in the rest of the world. Toyota said it was expanding the recall . it announced in April 2013 that involved 2.1million vehicles because . the serial numbers that parts maker Takata had provided were incomplete. Nissan and Honda are also investigating whether to recall more vehicles after parts maker Takata admitted that it had not fully identified the flawed components during a 2013 recall. Last year carmakers including Toyota, Honda, Nissan . Motor Co and BMW recalled 3.6 million vehicles due to . problems with the airbag inflator that could potentially explode and . injure the driver or passengers. Toyota said it had been notified of . one case in which a defective airbag inflator had caused a seat cover to . burn. It said all of the recalled vehicles were equipped with . passenger-seat airbags that could be defective and deploy ""abnormally"" in the event of an accident. Shares of Takata dropped after the announcement and were down over 4 percent when the Tokyo market closed. In 2013 Nissan, Honda, Toyota and BMW recalled a total of 3.6million vehicles after the fault was discovered. Nissan and Honda are investigating whether they are affected by this new fault . Takata admitted it improperly stored chemicals and botched the manufacture of propellants used to inflate airbags, some of which were used in Honda vehicles . A Takata spokesman said that more vehicles could be recalled by other manufacturers because of potential airbag inflator defects. Takata has acknowledged to U.S. safety regulators that it improperly stored chemicals and botched the manufacture of the explosive propellants used to inflate airbags. The company has also said that it kept inadequate quality-control records which made it impossible to identify vehicles with potentially defective airbag inflators a decade or more after they were manufactured at factories in the United States and Mexico. The Takata recall in 2013 was the largest airbag-related recall in history and came after a series of accidents and at least two deaths allegedly caused by faulty airbags.","Toyota is recalling 2.27million cars worldwide over airbag inflator fault .

"By . Amanda Williams . Londoners will be able to rent out their homes like a hotel under plans to abolish 40 year old laws which ban renting out properties for less than three months. It means those in the capital will be able to use holiday websites such as Airbnb - which allow homeowners to rent out their properties to visiting tourists on a daily rate basis - without fearing the law. Property laws currently state that . Londoners must apply for planning permission if they want to rent out . their property for less than three months. However, many already advertise their homes on the site and British company One Fine Stay. Londoners will be able to turn their homes into 'hotels' on sites such as Airbnb under plans to abolish 40 year old laws which ban renting out properties for less than three months . It means that those in the capital will be able to use holiday websites such as Airbnb - which allow homeowners to rent out their properties to visiting tourists on a daily rate basis - without fearing the law . Eric Pickles, the Communities Secretary, told the Telegraph: 'It's . time to change the outdated, impractical and restrictive laws from the . Seventies, open up London's homes to visitors and allow Londoners to . make some extra cash.' The home sharing sites are becoming increasingly popular with holidaymakers who are looking for a cheaper alternative to hotels. They are also popular with those who often spend time away from home - meaning they can let their empty property and make some money at the same time. While councils have been concerned that short term lets affect the sense of community and increase crime and littering, Mr Pickles said the change in the law, under the Deregulation Bill, will not allow people to turn their homes into hotels or hostels without applying for change of use planning permission. Measures will also be taken to ensure that homes intended for Londoners are not solely being used for short–term lettings. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said it was time to change the outdated, impractical and restrictive laws from the Seventies, and 'open up London's homes to visitors and allow Londoners to make some extra cash' In 2012, those looking to rent out their properties to foreigners staying during the Olympics without seeking proper permission were threatened with fines of up to £20,000. The latest guidance comes after home owners have been allowed to . rent out their driveways without seeking official permission. Airbnb was launched in San Francisco in 2008. Since then more than 15million owners have used the site to advertise rooms or apartments. In New York State most properties are prohibited from being used for short–term lets. But the apartment-sharing site won a huge court battle last month when the New York Supreme Court quashed a subpoena from Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's office seeking user's personal information. And legislation set to be unveiled in San Francisco would make it legal for city residents to rent out their homes on sites such as Airbnb, but only if they have liability insurance and meet other requirements.","Means those in capital will be able to use holiday websites such as Airbnb .

"By . Jamie Beatson . It was supposed to be an exclusive fundraising event for the students of Scotland’s oldest university. But instead, a wealthy reveller at the Oktoberfest at St Andrews ended up in court after he bit off the ear of a former World’s Strongest Man finalist. Emanuele Ferrero de Gubernatis Ventimiglia bit into Jamie Barr’s left ear during a struggle at the event in Fife last March. Jamie Barr, left, a former World's Strongest Man finalist, lost part of his ear after Emanuele Ferrero de Gubernatis Ventimiglia, right, bit it off during a struggle at an Oktoberfest event at St Andrews University . Mr Barr had been working at the event and had tried to prevent Ventimiglia, who was wearing lederhosen, getting into a taxi with his girlfriend after the couple had argued and she asked for him to be taken away. But despite admitting biting off Mr Barr’s ear Ventimiglia – a descendant of the Fiat company founder – walked free after trial at Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court. A jury decided that the 24-year-old Italian, from Turin but now living in London’s exclusive Knightsbridge, had acted in self-defence during the fight and found the charge not proven. The St Andrews Charity Oktoberfest attracts wealthy and titled guests from across the world as well as hundreds of students. Mr Barr, 49, told a jury he had once finished ninth in the World’s Strongest Man competition. He had been working as a first aider at the Oktoberfest, at Kinkell Byre, St Andrews, and had been helping at a taxi queue at the end of the night to clear a backlog of revellers. Mr Barr told the court: ‘There was a girl in the back of a taxi crying hysterically. She had her legs up trying to kick a guy away who was trying to get in the taxi. ‘I asked if she was OK and asked if she wanted him in there – she said no. I told him he couldn’t get in and he asked if I had a problem – he wasn’t happy. ‘I shut the taxi door and he appeared right in front of me. He put his head right against my forehead.  I felt him bite my ear and he came back towards me and scratched my face. I pushed him as he bit me then headbutted him and punched him. ‘Then I realised he had bit a large chunk of my ear off – they found it on the ground, it just looked like a bit of rubber. ‘I was taken to hospital with the piece of ear but they couldn’t re-attach it.’ The Quadrangle at St Andrews University: Mr Barr was working as a first aider at the Oktoberfest, at Kinkell Byre, St Andrews, and had been helping to clear a backlog of revellers at a taxi queue at the end of the night . Mr Barr told the court he had undergone a series of operations. A skin graft was taken from his arm to be stretched over the new ear cartilage and re-attached. But Gordon Jackson, QC, defending, branded Mr Barr a ‘liar’ and said he had made up his version of events to paint Ventimiglia as the aggressor. Ventimiglia, in his evidence, said he had ‘never been in a situation like it’ and was ‘s***-scared’ – and had ‘done the only thing I could’ to escape the situation. He claimed Mr Barr had ‘aggressively’ hauled him from the taxi before attacking him – and that biting his ear was the only way he could get out. Ventimiglia pleaded not guilty on indictment to a charge of assault to severe injury and permanent disfigurement, and lodged a special defence of self-defence. A jury took just an hour to find the charge against him not proven by a majority and Sheriff Alistair Thornton told Ventimiglia he had been acquitted.","Jury rules Emanuele Ferrero de Gubernatis Ventimiglia acted in self-defence .

"By . Tamara Cohen, In Sweden . and Daily Mail Reporter . Helle Thorning-Schmidt, the wife of Neil Kinnock's son Stephen, is among Downing Street's preferred candidates for president of the European Commission . Neil Kinnock’s daughter-in-law is among Downing Street’s preferred  candidates for president of the European Commission – in what could become the latest coup for the family in snaring lucrative top jobs in Brussels. Helle Thorning-Schmidt, the prime minister of Denmark, is being touted for the role, with David Cameron said to view her as a much more acceptable alternative to Jean-Claude Juncker, the arch-federalist former prime minister of Luxembourg. He would also be happy with Lithuanian president Dalia Grybauskaite, a free marketeer who models herself on Margaret Thatcher. Miss . Thorning-Schmidt, 47, is married to former Labour leader Lord Kinnock’s . son Stephen. She infamously featured in a selfie with Mr Cameron and . Barack Obama last year at Nelson Mandela’s funeral service. Even . though Miss Thorning-Schmidt is a social democrat, Mr Cameron is . believed to favour her because her country is on the Eurosceptic wing of . the continent. Should she get the job – worth £236,000 a year – she . would be the latest Kinnock to work in Europe. Lord and Lady Kinnock . have both held roles in Europe, the former as an EU Commissioner and the . latter as an MEP, and their son worked as a research assistant in the . European Parliament. Last night a Government source said Miss Thorning-Schmidt was one of several ‘high-quality’ candidates who are ‘younger, bolder’ and more willing to ‘take the European Commission on a different course’. Disagreements over who should take on the crucial role continued yesterday when Angela Merkel publicly slapped down Mr Cameron for issuing ‘threats’ to leave Europe if he does not get his way over choosing the European Commission president. Mr Cameron was at a summit in Sweden yesterday trying to drum up support to block front-runner Mr Juncker. The Prime Minister fears Mr Juncker is not open to reform of the EU, and has suggested appointing him could send Britain drifting towards the exit door in the in-out referendum he has promised for 2017. German Chancellor Angela Merkel this morning warned David Cameron not to make threats in his bid to overhaul Britain's relationship with Brussels . Mrs Merkel insisted she was still backing Jean-Claude Juncker to be President of the European Commission, but urged other leaders to act in a 'European spirit' When the Prime Minister was asked if he had threatened to leave the European Union, at a press conference in Harpsund, the Swedish prime minister's country residence, Mrs Merkel cut in. She said: 'I made myself clear by saying that I am for Jean-Claude Juncker. But when I made that statement in Germany I also made the point that we act in a European spirit. ‘We always do that because otherwise you would never reach a compromise...Threats are not part and parcel of that spirit. That is not part of the way in which we usually proceed.' It was a snub for Mr Cameron who is understood to have hit out at Mr Juncker's suitability for the role at the leaders dinner on Monday night. The four leaders agreed that whoever the next commissioner is, a commitment to tackle benefit tourism must be top of their agenda. The commissioner's programme is written in the next few months and they plan to convince the other 24 national leaders that protecting country's social security systems from the freedom of movement rules must be on it. Tensions were laid bare during the joint press conference between Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Swedish Prime Minister, Fredrik Reinfeldt and British Prime Minister David Cameron, at the summer residence, Harpsund, south of Stockholm, Sweden . The four European leaders posed first on a boat and later at lecterns in the sunshine, keen to present a united front. But behind the scenes there remain deep divisions about who will run the European Commission. Last night they dined on smoked salmon tartare, followed by roast filet of beef with bacon and morel ragu and for dessert, elderflower semifredo strawberry compote with meringue and strawberries. The public spat over Jean-Claude Juncker will leave an unpleasant taste in the mouth. Mr Cameron attending the mini summit in the Swedish countryside, with Mrs Merkel, the Swedish prime minister Frederik Reinfeldt and Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte, all EU reformers. The foursome enjoyed a scenic boat trip on a balmy Monday evening in matching life jackets, then enjoyed an intimate meal at the residence, where Mr Cameron told them allowing Mr Juncker to have the role would be a 'stitch up' by the European Parliament and would set a ‘dangerous precedent’ for the future. The leaders nailed down their priorities for reform and who would best fulfil them. A clampdown on benefit tourism is a top priority, along with jobs and growth, cutting red tape for businesses and completing the single market in energy. Downing Street sources say there are ‘high quality’ alternative candidates Mr Cameron would support. They are thought to include the Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, who featured in a selfie with Mr Cameron and Barack Obama last year in South Africa. Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund has ruled herself out, but would be a popular choice for many, and Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite, a free marketer who models herself on Margaret Thatcher. Sweden’s Mr Reinfeldt boosted Mr Cameron’s hopes yesterday this week by saying he agreed that national leaders, not MEPs should pick the Commission president. Mr Cameron said after the summit that he wanted Britain to stay in a reformed EU, and would leave the decision to a referendum. But he added: ‘Obviously the approach that the EU takes between now and then will be very important. If we can achieve reforms, if we can demonstrate openness, competitiveness, flexibility, less interference, reform - if people are capable of taking the EU forward in that direction that will be helpful. Obviously if the EU doesn't go in that direction that would be very unhelpful.’ Labour leader Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg have both backed Mr Cameron’s bid to block Mr Juncker, and he is thought to have support from other leaders including Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi. Mr Juncker emerged as the front runner because he was picked earlier this year by MEPs from the European People's Party group - which won the most seats in the EU Parliament, but still only took less than a third. Angela Merkel is pushing for arch-federalist Jean-Claude Juncker (left) to become the new EC president, but IMF chief Christine Lagarde (second left) has emerged as a compromise candidate favoured by David Cameron. Other politicians in line for Europe's most powerful position include Danish PM Helle Thorning-Schmidt and Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny . Jean-Claude Juncker is the favourite to become the new European Commission President - replacing the outgoing former Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Manuel Barroso. The former Luxembourg prime minister was chosen as the candidate for the top job by the European Parliament's main conservative group, the European People's Party. The EPP emerged from last week's elections with the most seats - leaving Mr Juncker in poll position for the EU's most powerful job. But the Commission President is chosen by European leaders including David Cameron - and not by the Parliament. MEPs do however have to confirm the leaders' choice for the job in a vote. The other candidates for the top EU job include the IMF chief Christine Lagarde. Miss Lagarde was finance minister under former President Nicolas Sarkozy before moving to the IMF at the height of the euro zone's debt crisis in 2011 to replace disgraced French politician Dominique Strauss-Kahn. Her term runs until 2016. A fluent English-speaker who headed a major US law firm before holding ministerial office in France, she is highly regarded by German leader Angela Merkel. Center-left Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt is also under consideration. The former MEP is the daughter-in-law of Neil Kinnock, the ex Labour leader and European commissioner. If Mrs Merkel was open to a French candidate for one of the top jobs, Paris might offer Socialist former Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault - a fluent German-speaker who was replaced in March but is well regarded in Berlin. Another candidate for the EU Commission President is the current Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny. The Fine Gael leader became Ireland's leader in 2011, so might be open to moving to Brussels.","Prime minister of Denmark being touted for the European Commission role .

"By . Damien Gayle . Runaway: Bernard Mr Jordan, a former Navy lieutenant, travelled alone from his care home in Hove, East Sussex, to the ceremonies in France . The veteran who escaped carers to go to the 70th anniversary of D-Day in Normandy is to be awarded the freedom of his home city. Bernard Jordan, 89, is to be rewarded for his 'spirit and determination' after his audacious trip 'captured the imagination of all generations'. Mr Jordan, a former Royal Navy lieutenant, made headlines after he travelled alone from his care home in Hove, East Sussex, to the commemoration ceremonies in France. With his medals hidden under his coat, he slipped past carers, took the bus to Brighton station and caught the train to Portsmouth, where he boarded a ferry to Caen, Normandy. Although he had no accreditation for the main event, he was allowed in and ended up sitting within 100 yards of the Queen and other world leaders at the poignant anniversary. Brighton and Hove mayor Brian Fitch is recommending that Mr Jordan, who is himself a former mayor of the city, be awarded the freedom of Brighton and Hove - the highest honour the city can bestow. He will join First World War hero Henry Allingham, the former world’s oldest man, and Olympic 800m gold medallist Steve Ovett in being awarded the city’s freedom. Mr Fitch said he had invited Mr Jordan to the mayor’s parlour for a meeting to plan the city’s Armistice Day celebrations in November. 'I will be putting it to the council we should honour our heroes like Bernard Jordan who captured our imagination with his fantastic and successful effort in getting to Normandy against all the odds,' he said. 'It’s that spirit and determination that led Britain and its allies to liberate Europe from the tyranny of the Nazis. 'It’s not often you get the opportunity to give the city’s highest honour to someone who has served as a councillor but I feel that it’s really fitting to honour him in this way.' Mr Jordan will celebrate his 90th birthday next week. The reports of his disappearance last week led a missing person's search with police checking hospitals, bus firms and taxi companies. The hunt was only called off when a woman he met in France called up staff at The Pines care home to tell them where he was. Mr Jordan said he had expected to be in trouble, but instead carers gave him a hero’s welcome. A care home worker keeps a firm grip on Mr Jordan: Brighton and Hove mayor Brian Fitch is recommending that Mr Jordan, who is also a former mayor of the town, be awarded the freedom of Brighton and Hove . 'I just wanted to go over and join in with the commemorations,' he said. 'Being a veteran myself, this was important to me and it meant the world to be there. 'I met some great characters - from old veterans to dancing girls - and I loved every minute. It was worth it. 'It was such an exciting experience - it was a smashing event but it is marvellous to be back.' Since Brighton and Hove City Council was formed in 1997, the freedom of the city has been awarded to five people. Flight Lieutenant Marc Heal, from Brighton, who rescued 29 injured troops during missions in Afghanistan, received the honour in 2011. Burmese politician and Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi and local government reporter Adam Trimingham also have the honour. Ladies' man: Mr Jordan with two young women in Ouistreham, Normandy, during his adventure . Once nominated, a freeman would have to be a full council decision, requiring at least two-thirds to vote in favour. A Brighton and Hove City Council spokesman said: 'The Freedom of the city is reserved for recognition of a person’s contribution to the city and local community over a period of time. 'They will usually have a local connection. 'Nominations are considered by our Leaders Group - the leaders of all three of our political groups - when they meet monthly.'","Bernard Jordan, 89, travelled alone from Hove, East Sussex, to Normandy .

Adam Diplock will appear before magistrates this month accused of assault causing actual bodily harm . Jack Pack: Adam Chandler, Alfie Palmer, Andrew Bourn and Sean Ryder Wolf on Britain's Got Talent . Other members of the group include Alfie Palmer, Andrew Bourn and Sean Ryder Wolf. Judge Simon Cowell praised the group's style after they came fourth in the live finals of the ITV show with their version of Frank Sinatra's That's Life. Members of the group gave up their jobs to focus on their music career. The alleged victim is believed to be a former girlfriend according to The Mirror. A Kent police spokesman said a 29-year-old man will appear at Maidstone Magistrate's Court (pictured) Diplock, who got to the X Factor finals in 2007 in a band called Futureproof, was interviewed by police. Futureproof was formed from male singers who initially auditioned as soloists but did not make it past the bootcamp stage. However, believing that talent had been lost, judge Louis Walsh decided to give them a lifeline and invited them back as a group. The group went onto make it past bootcamp to the judge's houses where they were told by mentor Simon Cowell they had made it to the final 12. However, they were voted off on the third live show. Last month it emerged the members of Jack Pack had all had successful careers in the showbiz industry. Collectively, the boy band have supported a vast array of pop stars including Sir Tom Jones, Westlife, Sugarbabes, Boys II Men and Blue. Diplock is also a wedding singer while Andrew Bourn and Alfie Palmer are Michael Buble impersonators. A Kent Police spokesman said: 'A 29-year-old man has been summonsed to appear before Maidstone magistrates on June 24 to face a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.'

"By . Sam Webb . A pair of biscuits which amazingly survived some of the bloodiest battles of the First World War are to go under the hammer. The bidding at Lockdales auctioneers in Martlesham, near Ipswich, Suffolk, will start at £60, but huge worldwide interest sparked by the 100th anniversary of the start of the Great War make a much higher final figure likely. A soldier, L. B Charles, who fought in the bloody battles of Gallipoli and the Dardanelles in Turkey, brought the biscuits home with him. Tough: These biscuits from a major campaign in the First World War will go under the hammer next week. They are almost 100 years old . Chris Elmy, of Lockdales auctioneers, with the enduring wartime 'treats'. Interest in the First World War is at a peak and is expected to drive up the price . He is thought to be Lt Lionel Bruce Charles of the 5th Battalion, The Queen’s Regiment, said to have lived for a time at Wroxham House, Norwich. The biscuits have been preserved for 99 years and now the bizarre war-time keepsakes are to be sold. Each one has a label on that reads 'Biscuits used by troops in Suvla Bay', the Turkish peninsula captured by British forces after horrific fighting and massive losses. Dr Rachel Duffett of the University of Essex is an expert on food eaten by soldiers during the conflict and is the author of 'The Stomach for Fighting: Food and the Soldiers of The Great War'. British troops returning from the trenches during the Dardanelles campaign. Much of the campaign was a shambles and Allied losses were heavy . She said: 'The reason they last so long is they're pretty much inedible. They're made from flour, salt and water and that's about it. 'They're rock hard.' The three ingredients are mixed into a paste and then baked for about 45 minutes on a high heat -  a recipe Dr Duffett has tried. She added: 'They are just dreadful. They're like the worst children's rusk ever.' Could the one up for auction still be edible? Dr Duffett wouldn't advise taking a bite. 'I don't think they would kill you. I wouldn't want to try though.' At the start of the war, British soldiers at the front were allowed 10oz of meat and 8oz of vegetables per day, but this soon fell as supply lines were disrupted due thanks to naval blockades and the chaos of war. By 1916, the meat ration was down to 6oz a day, and as the war wore on, meat was only provided once every nine days. Other goods provided - nearly always tinned - were tea, bacon, cheese, jam and (famously disgusting) meat stews. Soldiers were forced to fend for themselves and reportedly grew vegetable patches in reserve trenches and hunted and fished in quiet moments. Cooks tried to find local vegetables when possible, but were often forced to use weeds, nettles and leaves to add to stews and soups. Flour was scarce in 1916 and ground-up turnips were used as a substitute, resulting in bread that gave soldiers severe stomach problems. Tommies were also forced to endure pea-soup with horse meat chunks. By the time troops began to land at Suvla Bay the Turks were well dug in - and exacted a terrible price . The biscuits are famous for the hardness and longevity that has seen many survive for nearly a century. Indeed, some were so tough soldiers turned them into picture frames. The British Army had 12 different recipes for its biscuits and bought more than 129m lbs (58.5m kg) of biscuits in 1918 alone, at a cost of £3,394,000. They were incredibly difficult to bite into, but soldiers would dunk them in their tea or crumble them into the stews that were a daily staple on the front line. James Sadler, the auction manager of Lockdales, said: 'This 100th anniversary year since the start of The Great War makes all memorabilia from the period collectable, including biscuits. 'This lot is being viewed with great interest by many 1914-18 conflict collectors.' The biscuits will be sold next Thursday, the second day of the special two-day fine arts sale. Troops going to land at Gallipoli on barges. The barges were later used as water storage tanks on the beaches . British and French forces launched a massive naval attack on Turkish forces in the Dardanelles, the strategically vital strait in north-western Turkey separating Europe from Asia, in the spring of 1915. The onslaught was opened on March 18 by 10 Allied battleships. Allied forces had bombarded and destroyed Turkish forts near the entrance to the Dardanelles. But the deadly waters were still heavily mined, forcing Britain and France to sweep the area before its fleet could set out. Three battleships were sunk and two more badly damaged. By the time troops began to land on April 25 the Turks were well dug in - and exacted a terrible price. The landing at Suvla Bay was an amphibious landing made on the Aegean coast of the Gallipoli peninsula in the Ottoman Empire. It was a desperate attempt to break the deadlock of the Dardanelles Campaign but was hindered by mismanagement and the troops were eventually forced to retreat by a robust Turkish defence. In the wake of the battle the British commander at Suvla, Lieutenant-General Sir Frederick Stopford, was dismissed. The 61-year-old slept as the landings took place and his performance in command is seen as one of the most incompetent feats of leadership of the Great War. Allied troops were finally evacuated in December 1915 and January 1916 after months of bitter bloodshed in one of the most disastrous campaigns of the war. The Turks lost 300,000 men and the Allies about 214,000.","The notoriously tough biscuits have endured more than nine decades .

"By . Jill Reilly . and Ted Thornhill . Gunmen in Pakistan attacked a training facility for airport police near the Karachi airport on Tuesday, forcing a temporary suspension of flights and triggering a brief shootout with security forces just days after a brazen Taliban assault on the country's busiest airfield. Law enforcement personnel managed to quickly repulse the attack by as many as three gunmen, an assault claimed by a resurgent Taliban who warned its violence ‘wasn't over yet.’ Television stations aired footage of security guards frantically taking up positions behind buildings or earthen berms at the training facility, roughly half a mile from Karachi's Jinnah International Airport. The Pakistani military also sent soldiers to assist. Scroll down for video .

At . least 11 members of the Airport Security Force were killed during that . attack. Pakistani . authorities discovered more bodies from that siege Tuesday morning.

People watching Nikki Elise AKA 'Sajeden' playing the game Dota 2 were nearly as surprised as the 28-year-old Tempe gamer was after hearing a crash and then watching a man with a hand gun appear to rummage through the well-known player's gaming equipment. Sajeden is popular in Dota 2 fan circles and has a worldwide viewership on the streaming site Twitch. A friend who knew where she and her 29-year-old roommate lived happened to be watching and alerted police. Scroll down for video . Streaming: Nikki Elise AKA Sajedene was using the website Twitch to share her gaming experience with friends worldwide when armed robbers invaded her home early Monday . Shocking: As viewers watched aghast, Sajedene reacted fearfully to two men who kicked down her door carrying guns. Luckily, at least one of the viewers knew where the 28-year-old Tempe woman lived and called police . 'At that point, gamers from around the world were watching the home invasion occur while trying to contact the corresponding law enforcement agency,' Lt. Michael Pooley told KTVK. Thanks to calls from the concerned viewers, authorities arrived so fast that they made contact with at least one of the suspects. Pooley said one man was still in the apartment when officers arrived. The man fled on foot but one was taken into custody after a short chase, Pooley told KTVK. Pooley says the other man remains at large. Terrifying: One of the men enters the frame and is clearly carrying a gun after Sajedene leaves the camera's view . Nabbed: Thanks to the phone calls that poured in from concerned viewers, police arrived at the scene in time to nab one of the suspects. The other remained at large Monday . Pretty gamer: The attractive 28-year-old is well-known in Dota 2 gaming circles and one of the invaders is seen rummaging near her computer hardware . Guns or hardware? Some have suggested that the invaders were trying to steal a firearm. Here, Elise is pictured in a photo posted to Facebook in which she shows off a rifle . The suspects are both described as Hispanic. According to azfamily.com, the one still on the loose 'has scuffy facial hair and was wearing a gray shirt and black pants.' He could still be carrying a handgun. According to Pooley, authorities elsewhere also got calls from other people who were watching the video feed and who also saw the break-in. He said dispatchers were trying to pin down details of those calls. Neither Elise nor her roommate, also a woman, were injured, Pooley said.","The 28-year-old Arizona woman was playing the game Dota 2 when two men carrying weapons break down her door around 4am Monday .

"By . Dan Bloom . Murder: Susan Buckley (pictured) killed her on-off boyfriend in a row over Christmas presents . A woman has been jailed for life after she murdered her on-off boyfriend in a drunken row over presents on Christmas Day. Susan Buckley left Geoffrey Carter with two stab wounds and a black eye before setting his flat alight, leaving him to die from the fumes as he lay passed out on his bed. The 57-year-old was seen covered in soot and screaming for help outside the flat in Walsall, West Midlands. Buckley denied murder throughout the trial, but was convicted by a jury - with the judge saying she had the opportunity to put the fire out. She will serve at least 17 years before she can be considered for parole. Wolverhampton Crown Court heard Buckley and her 58-year-old boyfriend had been in an on-off, love-hate relationship for 27 years before the argument. The affair was a stormy one. Both drank heavily and would often argue and assault each other, police said. Things came to a head on Christmas Eve last year, when the couple started drinking and arguing, continuing into the early hours of Christmas Day. In the afternoon, Buckley threw a coat at Mr Carter together with a Christmas present he had bought for her. Forensic evidence showed Buckley then used . a naked flame to ignite clothes at the home of Mr Carter, which set a lounge chair alight. Firefighters were called at around 5.30pm. When they searched the flat, they found Mr Carter lying unconscious on a bed. He was taken to Walsall Manor Hospital but died of smoke inhalation an hour later. Blaze: Geoffrey Carter was found unconscious on a bed in his top floor flat in Walsall, West Midlands (pictured) A . post mortem showed Mr Carter had died of smoke inhalation. He was . also found to have two knife wounds to his arms and a black eye. Judge John Wait told Buckley today: 'Geoffrey Carter was at the time of his . death, through drink, incapable of assisting himself, though not . otherwise vulnerable. 'This fire was started in a block of flats and it put others, the other occupants and officers from the fire service, at risk. 'Geoffrey . Carter had not been in contact with his family for some time but his . death has come as a terrible shock to his daughter. 'It is evident from what she has said that the last month has been very difficult for her.' Christmas murder: Police outside the flat after the incident. The pair had a stormy relationship for 27 years . Detective Inspector Gary Plant, of West Midlands Police, said: 'Susan Buckley deliberately set fire to the inside of Geoffrey Carter’s . flat, after she assaulted him following a further argument between the . couple. 'The sentence reflects the serious nature of her actions. 'By . doing what she did, she took Geoffrey Carter's life; but, if the fire . hadn’t been controlled as quickly as it was, the lives of others within . the block could also have been taken. 'Susan . now has time to reflect upon her actions during the time of her . custodial sentence and the impact it will have upon the rest of her . life.'","Susan Buckley, 57, denied murdering Geoffrey Carter at his Walsall flat .

"By . Sean Poulter . An advertisement for the anti-ageing pill Imedeen, which is promoted by supermodel Christy Turlington, has been banned. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has ruled the manufacture behind the wonder pills, Pfizer, failed to provide convincing research or evidence that they work. The US drugs company has invested millions in the pills and supplied a raft of research it claimed backed up marketing for the pills that they helped cure fine lines and wrinkles from within. Model Christy Turlington, 45, was hired in January this year at great expense as a model and ambassador for the Imedeen brand around the world . However, the ASA said none of these were sufficiently robust and reliable to show the effects claimed. The ruling is serious blow for Pfizer, which earlier this year was at the centre of a controversial and eventually unsuccessful bid to buy the British drugs company AstraZeneca. It is also embarrassing for Turlington, 45, who was hired in January this year at great expense as a model and ambassador for the brand around the world. When she took up the post, she spoke in glowing terms about the wonder pills, saying: ‘It’s very important for me to maintain great looking skin – not only as a model, but as a woman with lots of demands and many roles to fill each day. ‘Caring for my skin on the inside is just as important as how I care for the outside and I can count on Imedeen to deliver deep down nourishment where it matters most.’ A regional press ad for the skincare tablet stated: ‘Imedeen - Beautiful skin begins within. Award-winning skincare in a tablet.’ It boasted that the pill was the winner of several consumer and beauty awards and that the brand had been ‘pioneering skincare from within since 1991’. It said the product was a: ‘Natural-based, scientifically tested skincare formulations for different ages that work from within to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.’ When Turlington took the job, she said: 'It's very important for me to maintain great looking skin ¿ not only as a model, but as a woman' The ASA asked Pfizer to provide evidence that the pills had the anti-ageing properties claimed to establish whether they were accurate and complied with EU health claims rules. The company provided six studies which were then assessed by an independent expert to understand whether the pills really do ‘work from within to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles’. The ASA said the expert considered that three of the studies were not adequate substantiation, because they did not use the standard scientific procedures involving control groups where the skin of women who did not use the pills was compared against those that did. One of the studies consisted of only six participants, two with medical conditions that might have affected the skin or general health. In addition, pre and post treatment grading pictures were not assessed for two of the six participants. The ASA said the rest of the research supplied by the company was confusing and difficult to interpret. The watchdog said: ‘The studies involved three, four and six-month trials with the results measured by clinical grading, self-evaluation and visual imaging techniques, but did not use methods to assess direct measures of wrinkles before or after treatment.’ In many cases the women involved in the trials did not see any beneficial effects. Even tests to measure the skin thickness of the women involved did not show a clear benefit of taking the tablets. The ASA said: ‘We considered that the reports provided were not sufficiently robust to support the claim ‘worked from within to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles” and concluded that the claim was misleading.’ The complaint was brought by the Labour peer Lord Lipsey, who is chairman of the All-Party Statistics Group, which is campaigning for the honest use of figures and research. He welcomed the ASA ruling saying: ‘This comprehensively demolishes the studies the company cited in support of its claim. ‘This advert sought to exploit human vanity and human credulousness. This case underlines how right Labour was to ask searching questions about Pfizer when it attempted to take over AstraZeneca.’ Matt Dawson's advertisement has been banned by the ASA for being misleading . A TV advert for a superfood promoted by former England rugby international Matt Dawson has been banned because it wrongly boasted of its nutritional values. In the ad for Bioglan Superfoods Chia and Flax seeds Dawson told viewers ‘Have you discovered the power of a Bioglan superfood that you can add to your diet every day? It's highly nutritious.’ The ad went on to claim by adding it to your breakfast consumers would get ‘as much protein as a small egg: more calcium than 100ml of milk; as much fibre as a cup of oats, and a high source of the Omega 3 fatty acid.’ Dawson concluded, ‘The pure goodness of a Bioglan superfood is a great addition to a healthy diet. It’s so simple, and easy to enjoy. Bioglan superfood: good nutrition for you.’ However the advertising watchdog upheld complaints that it broke EU rules on what a ‘superfood’ actually is. It said: ‘We considered the emphasis of the ad was on the comparative nutrition claims and not the specific health claims and that the ad was therefore presented in such a way that suggested it was comparative nutrition claims that supported the ""superfood"" general health claim, when this was not the case.' They ordered that the advertisement should not appear again in its current form.","Turlington, 45, hired as worldwide brand ambassador in January this year .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . and Hugo Duncan . Britain’s resurgent economy is now bigger than it was before the great recession struck, figures showed yesterday. Gross domestic product – the total size of the economy – increased 0.9 per cent between March and May, according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. The growth spurt meant output was 0.2 per cent higher at the end of last month than it was at the pre-recession peak of January 2008. Analysis by the economic think tank NIESR shows the UK economy has returned to its pre-crash peak, but only after six years . Experts at NIESR hailed it a ‘symbolic milestone’ for the UK as the longest slump on record finally came to an end. Output crashed by 7.2 per cent between 2008 and 2009 and it has taken more than six years for the losses to be clawed back. But . Britain is now on track for its best performance since before the . crisis, with the Bank of England expecting growth of 3.4 per cent this . year. A separate report by the Office for National Statistics, which will release official figures at the end of the month, also . showed that British manufacturing is growing at the fastest pace for . nearly four years. It came after figures showed growth of 1.1 per cent from February to April. 'By this estimate, the level of UK has surpassed its pre-recession peak, and is approximately 0.2 per cent above where it was in January 2008,' NIESR said. The recessions from 1920-24 and 1930-34 took almost four years to recover from. After the 1990-93 recession, which saw unemployment soar and riots in the streets, it took just 30 months to reverse the economic contraction. By contrast, after the global financial crisis hit in 2008, with taxpayers bailing out British banks, the economy shrunk by 7.4 per cent compared with its pre-crash high. The recovery only really took hold in the last 18 months, with steady and sustained growth. Mr Osborne is expected to use his Mansion House speech on Thursday to insist that more needs to be done to secure the recovery, including tackling Britain's debt mountain. He will unveil plans to make it easier for developers to build on brownfield sites being held by public bodies, warning the only way to deal with soaring property prices is to build more homes. The symbolic moment will be welcomed by Chancellor George Osborne, who has warned 'the job isn't done' Also yesterday, the Office for National Statistics said factory output rose 2 per cent between February and April – the strongest three month performance since the Coalition came to power in May 2010. David Cameron wrote on Twitter: 'Manufacturing output is up 4.4 per cent year-on-year. More factories making more goods means more jobs. Our long-term economic plan is working.' The UK was hit by one of the largest slumps among the world's leading economies, and has taken a long time to recover. Among the G7 group of major nations, only Italy is still below its peak seen before the crash. After being in the economic doldrums for many months, the UK economy is growing faster than most major economies – and crucially is not relying on consumer spending to fuel the boom. Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, said at the weekend: ‘It is growth is fuelled both by consumption but also now investment, but not just public investment as we recommended earlier on, but also with private investment. ‘Exports is lagging behind a little bit, but those two big cylinders of growth, consumption and investment, are fuelling growth, which in our view makes it more sustainable than if it was fuelled exclusively by consumption as was feared a few months back.’ She warned risks remained on low productivity and rising housing prices, but asked if there was a property boom in Britain, Miss Lagarde replied: ‘No. What our team has clearly seen and acknowledged is that the housing market in the UK is multi-faceted.’","UK economy is now 0.2% above pre-crash peak, says NIESR think tank .

"By . Lucy Osborne . Teachers forced out of schools at the centre of the Trojan Horse allegations have been gagged by the authorities. At least 12 senior staff – most of them heads – were banned from speaking out as part of their six-figure pay-off deals, it emerged last night. Some claim they were bullied, intimidated and threatened over the bid by extremists to target state schools in Birmingham. Staying mute: Former members of staff at the Birmingham Schools at the centre of the Trojan Horse allegations, including Oldknow Academy, have been gagged by pay-off deals . Their concerns were vindicated this week when a three-month inquiry concluded that an organised campaign had been waged by governors to impose extreme Islamic policies on pupils, leading to a ‘culture of fear and intimidation’ among staff. Despite this, the teachers still feel unable to discuss what happened at their schools. And yesterday neither the Department for Education nor Birmingham City Council would guarantee the whistleblowers would not face action for speaking out. Local MP Khalid Mahmood called on the Government and council to ensure that former staff would be released from the gagging clauses. Mr Mahmood, Labour MP for Birmingham Perry Barr, said: ‘A lot of people are still not speaking even in private because they are frightened of what may happen. 'We need to get it out in the open. They need to be able to tell their stories.’ Urgent request: Labour MP for Birmingham Perry Barr, Khalid Mahmood, has said the 'gagging clauses' should be removed so staff at the Trojan Horse schools can speak out . The former head of Park View Academy resigned after being 'reduced to a figure head', and sources say she was used as a 'white face' to make the school's governing body seem diverse . He called on Education Secretary . Michael Gove and the council to issue ‘clear guidance’ that would ensure . staff could tell the truth about what happened. Reports . by Ofsted and the Education Funding Agency revealed that Muslim . governors had attempted to impose an Islamic agenda on several schools, . effectively turning them into Muslim faith schools. Governors . at a school in Bradford promoted an Islamic ethos by encouraging . teachers to modify their teaching to suit Muslim students. Minutes . of meetings between governors at Carlton Bolling College suggest that . boys and girls were separated during after-school workshops and some . trips were boys-only. Twelve teachers who tried to resist . the implementation of the strict policies – or tried to raise the alarm – . were made to resign and sign the gagging agreements, but Mr Mahmood . believes there may be dozens more forced out. A . source from one of the schools said she knew three former teachers who . were ‘bullied, paid, or a combination of the two’ to stay quiet. And several of those approached by the Mail yesterday said they wanted to speak out but were unable to. However, . one head, Bhupinder Kondal, told Radio 4’s The World Tonight she had . been forced out by religious conservatives at Oldknow Academy – the . primary school revealed to have used terms such as ‘white prostitute’ to . describe Western women in assemblies, to have taken pupils to Saudi . Arabia and to have removed Jesus dolls from plays. She . said: ‘I resigned against my will. I felt that I couldn’t carry on any . longer. I’ve been really unhappy about what I’ve gone through.’ And . Noshaba Hussain, Muslim former head of Springfield Primary, said she . was forced out by ‘well-organised and sinister’ extremists in 1993 and . made to sign a gagging clause. She said: ‘The council is pretending they . want to get to the truth but if they were sincere in that they would . remove these gagging clauses.’ The . DfE insisted that any gagging clauses would not prevent staff speaking . out in the public interest, while Birmingham City Council said staff . should feel able to ‘speak freely’. But the council did not deny it was . telling teachers not to speak to Ofsted or the media.","Former senior staff at schools involved in the Trojan Horse plot stay mute .

"By . Daniel Martin . Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude wants older people to use the internet to access government services . Older people must start using the . internet or run the risk of losing access to government services, a . senior Tory said yesterday. The vast majority of public services will only be available online in the future, said Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude. He . said millions of pounds can be saved by copying airlines, which only . provide services face-to-face if there is no way to move them online. The . minister called on older people to get ‘digitally engaged’ – because . getting to grips with the internet is a ‘better thing for people’s . lives’. But pensioners’ groups last night reacted with fury, saying that elderly people who . refused to ‘conform’ to the state’s demands would be treated as . ‘second-class citizens’. Those . who had paid taxes all their lives should be able to access government . services in whichever way they feel most comfortable – and not left to . ‘drown’, they said. At a . Treasury conference, Mr Maude said one-off help will be given for the . ‘digitally-excluded’ – chiefly pensioners. He said: ‘Our point is that . everything that can be delivered online should be delivered online and . only online.’ More than five million pensioners have never been online, estimates show. Ministers . are moving dozens of public services on to the internet, including the . carers’ allowance, used by the 3.2million carers a year. Driving . licences, the small claims service and ‘lasting powers of attorney’ – . which allow families to take control of a loved one’s financial affairs – . are also going online. Mr . Maude, addressing civil servants about government efficiency measures, . said such moves would cut the cost of manning phonelines or face-to-face . services. Help for . those who did not know how to use the internet would be given through a . ‘assisted digital’ service, provided by charities such as the . Alzheimer’s Society. But . the focus would be on showing them how to go online – not on helping . them to access services if they do not wish to use the internet. Mr . Maude also indicated that help would not be offered ‘repeatedly’. ‘They’re . doing it in a way that will help to get those people online, because . actually people will have in future richer lives if they become . digitally engaged,’ he said. Pensioner Joan Ibbotson was taught to use the internet on her iPad by a friend at her home in Plympton, Plymouth as part of a project funded by the Daily Mail. But many elderly people have no access to the internet . Pensioners’ groups yesterday expressed concern that services important to the . elderly, such as pensions, benefits and council tax, will be moved . online only. Dot Gibson, of the National Pensioners’ Convention, said ministers were creating an ‘information gap’. ‘The idea that we all have to be digital citizens or else we end up as second-class citizens is wrong,’ she said. Lisa . Harris, from Saga, added: ‘The digital tide is certainly turning, but . the Government needs to ensure we can all ride the technology wave and . not leave some left to drown unaided because they don’t choose to . “conform”.’ Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, added: ‘No-one should be locked out of any services simply because they don’t use the internet.’ People . should be able to vote from the comfort of their armchairs, Commons . Speaker John Bercow said last night. Allowing the electorate to go . online rather than to polling booths is hardly ‘earth-shattering’, he . told the Policy Exchange think-tank.","Cabinet Minister Francis Maude wants government to copy airline companies .

"By . James Slack . Stephen Lawrence, 18, was stabbed to death in an unprovoked racist attack as he waited at a bus stop in Eltham, southeast London . Corrupt police will face up to 14 years in jail under new laws introduced in response to the botched Scotland Yard investigation into the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence. Ministers said dishonest officers would be subject to ‘the full force of the criminal law’ under the proposals, which carry the same maximum sentence as burglary or importing Class B drugs. The widely-drawn legislation covers officers who threaten to do something - or not do something - for an ‘improper purpose’. Crucially, it will also apply to police who fail to act because of a friendship or other relationship with a perpetrator – a key allegation in the Lawrence case. A review by Mark Ellison QC, published in March, into the Metropolitan Police’s original Stephen Lawrence murder investigation in 1993 found evidence to suspect one of the officers in the inquiry team, DS John Davidson, acted corruptly. Davidson had a relationship with the gangster father of one of Stephen's killers and deliberately stalled the inquiry, it is alleged. The new offence will also be seen as a further crackdown on police behaviour in the wake of the Plebgate affair, which led to Cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell losing his job after a row with police at the gates of Downing Street in 2012. Police Minister Damian Green said: ‘Where police officers fall short of the high standards we expect of them, it is right that the full force of the criminal law is available to punish and deter acts of corruption by police officers. Neville Lawrence the father of Stephen, outside the Old Bailey, London, after Gary Dobson and David Norris were sentenced for Stephen's murder . Doreen Lawrence, the mother of  Stephen, during the ceremony when she took her seat in the House of Lords as Baroness Lawrence of Clarendon . ‘Corrupt . behaviour in the police should be deterred and punished so we can . maintain their standing in the eyes of the public and underline the . important work done by the overwhelming number of officers across the . country.’ Currently, . police can be prosecuted under other laws such as misconduct in public . office, but ministers believe the specific offence of police corruption . will act as an even stronger deterrent. Mark Ellison QC (above) published a review in March into the Metropolitan Police's original Stephen Lawrence murder investigation in 1993 . It . will cover cases in which a police officer acts improperly to obtain an . advantage for themselves or someone else, or to cause detriment to . someone else. Last week, the Mail revealed how a full probe into Davidson will examine claims he had a corrupt relationship with the gangster father of one of Stephen's killers and deliberately stalled the inquiry. In police intelligence reports the former detective sergeant was described as having 'no integrity as a police officer' and being 'open to offers from any source if financially viable'. The Metropolitan Police referred a file on Davidson to the IPCC two months ago after the Ellison report raised questions about his conduct in the days following Stephen's murder. Since the report was published, a series of Daily Mail investigations has exposed a web of suspected corruption in the Scotland Yard inquiries into the stabbing of Stephen and axe killing of private investigator Daniel Morgan in 1987. Scotland Yard chiefs believe it would be 'inappropriate' for the force to head the Davidson corruption probe. Instead, it will be carried out by a team of investigators from the IPCC or detectives from a provincial force, supervised by the watchdog. Barrister Mark Ellison's review of the Lawrence case in March found that Davidson may have acted corruptly. It was claimed he had admitted having a 'corrupt connection' with gangland boss Clifford Norris, the father of David Norris, who was finally convicted of Stephen's murder in 2012 along with Gary Dobson. The 18-year-old aspiring architect was stabbed to death by a racist white gang in April 1993. Not until 2012 were two of his killers convicted, and then only after a long campaign led by this newspaper to bring them to justice. The Daily Mail was in the forefront of the campaign to bring Stephen Lawrence's racist killers to justice .","Punishment would carry same maximum sentence as burglary or importing Class B drugs .

"By . Mia De Graaf . A police force has sparked confusion by recruiting an army of garden gnomes in a bid to fight summer crime. The 10 ornaments - in police uniforms - will act as the centrepiece of a new campaign to highlight the danger of theft, drink-driving and shoplifting. Blasting the move by Durham Police as 'baffling', Andy . Silvester of the Taxpayers' Alliance said the public need real actions, not stunts. Bizarre: Durham Police have recruited 10 garden gnomes to communicate safety warnings to the public . He told Mail Online: 'The public want bobbies on . the beat, and will be somewhat baffled that instead they've received a . series of amusing garden decorations. 'Gnomes are not, as far as I'm aware, particularly well-known for their crime-fighting ability.' The force will be unveiling one new gnome a week, with each representing a different type of crime. Stunts will include officers placing the . gnomes inside cars which have the windows left open - and they will then . post pictures on the force’s Facebook page. Anette Metcalfe, partnership liaison officer at the force, said that the gnomes were a fresh idea to get the message out. 'It’s a little bit different,' she said. 'We have had a problem with thefts from gardens and we run a campaign ever year called Summer Nights, so we wanted to do something different. 'It’s just a bit of fun with a serious message. We are asking people to point to all 10 as each represents a different type of crime. The force will be posting pictures on Facebook of their stunts in the hope that it will reduce summer crime . 'If officers see a car is insecure, we have a couple of spare gnomes who may just end up sat on the driver seat of that car,' said Anette. 'A gnome will be put on the driver’s seat while officers take a photo. 'That photo will then be put onto our Facebook pages to help raise awareness.' 'We need bobbies on the beat, not a series of amusing garden decorations' - Andy Silvester, Taxpayers' Alliance . They will then use a tool called Hawkeye and the car’s details to send a letter to the owner to show just how dangerous leaving a car unlocked is. Each week, a new gnome will be placed around the city of Darlington, in various shops, to get people thinking about crime. The unique gnomes - all named after TV police detectives - will address a different crime such as road safety, cycle security, neighbourhood watch, drink driving and shoplifting. PC Gene Hunt, the first gnome to be . deployed by the force, is named after the star of Life on Mars and will . alert drivers to the risks of leaving their cars unlocked. Some will come with a QR code that . residents can scan to be taken to a website, such as Durham police or . Crimestoppers, where they can find all the relevant information. Chief Constable Mike Barton is hoping that people will act on the advice of the gnomes. Bespoke: Each gnome, hand-painted by local potter Annette Metcalfe, represents a different type of crime . 'Although the introduction of the gnomes is light-hearted and a bit of a gimmick it also has a real purpose for us,” he said. 'These gnomes are going to be placed across Darlington with serious messages and it would be great for people to go out and find them.' Residents who spot all ten gnomes will also be entered into a prize draw, which shops in the area have contributed prizes to. The initiative was rolled out last week and will run over the summer months in conjunction with the town’s business improvement district and the gnomes created by Darlington business, Dekra Crete, free of charge.","Durham Police will use ten gnomes to communicate safety warnings .

"By . Mia De Graaf . A 20-year-old soldier has returned safely from Afghanistan with the 100-year-old Bible that has accompanied four generations of his family into five conflicts. Private Curtis Welsby took the Armed Services Testament 1916 - issued as standard to his great-great grandfather when he fought in World War One - with him to Camp Bastion last year. But the tiny Bible has also seen active service in World War Two, the Korean War and Northern Ireland with his relatives who all returned home safely. Heirloom: Private Curtis Welsby (left) went to Camp Bastion with the Armed Services Testament 1916 handed to his great-great-grandfather in World War One. Later, his grandfather Dennis Farrell took it to Korea (right) Paperback: Private Welsby hopes to pass the family heirloom onto his nephew who wants to join the army too . His great-great-grandfather Jay Greenwood was just a teenager when he lied about his age in order to sign up to go to the battlefields of World War One. It was then passed to Private Welsby’s grandfather Dennis Farrell who took it with him while serving in the Second World War from 1940 and later to Korea. The paperback Bible, which falls open at John and Acts, even survived Dennis’s time in a Korean prisoner of war camp and was later handed to his son, and Private Welsby’s uncle Gary Farrell who served in the King’s Regiment in Northern Ireland. Private Welsby, 20, from Manchester, serves in the 1st Battalion of the Mercian Regiment and recently returned from a seven month tour in Afghanistan. He hopes to pass the family heirloom onto his seven-year-old nephew who already has aspirations to join up. When his friend was killed in an explosion he turned to the well-leafed pages and found comfort in Revelations 21:4 which reads: 'and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain.' Comfort: When his friend was killed in an explosion he found comfort in Revelations 21:4 which reads: 'and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain' Private Welsby, from Manchester, served in the 1st Battalion of the Mercian Regiment for seven months . Private Welsby said: 'I knew it was a big responsibility to take such an important piece of family history with me into the field but I couldn’t have gone without it. 'It’s been everywhere so it was only right that it came out to Afghanistan with me. 'I carried it with me all the time and when we were out on patrol I would be checking every couple of hundred metres just to make sure it was still there. 'I definitely think of it as a good luck charm and something that was protecting me while I was out there. 'My comrades are a bit in awe of it. Most of us have something that we take with us as good luck from home but no-one else has got one of these. 'I've never seen anything else like it. 'I was really close to my Grandad and when he had it with him for the whole of the time he was a prisoner in Korea which is incredible. Weight: He said taking the heirloom felt like a huge responsibility but he couldn't have gone without it . 'I think that it gave him a bit of faith that he would get out, which he did thankfully. 'You just need something to comfort you a little bit and the Bible did that tremendously. 'Reading it after my friend died made feel happy for him thinking ‘it’s alright, he’s gone to a better place with no more war, fighting or anything’. 'Anything can happen when you’re out there but, when I picked up my Bible, I felt that nothing would happen to us. 'We got into fire-fights, but we always got out of them. ‘The local kids used to ask me for it. But I always said no. It’s been in my family for so long. It’ll be passed on to my nephew. He’s only seven, but he already wants to be in the army. 'It’s going to him in about 11 years when he joins the Army. 'That said, if I’m still around, I’ll be hanging onto it.

The sign, on a street in Rowley Fields, Leicester, is so high up that it it completely out of sight for some passengers. Howard Parker, who spotted the sign, said the information board was so high up it was almost useless. Bus users have been left with a pain in the neck after a bus timetable has been positioned seven feet up a lamppost . Anyone hoping to read the top of the sign would need the help of a foot stall or ladder. Mr Parker said the position of the sign was 'useless'. The 62-year-old said: 'I am about 5ft 9in and have pretty good eyesight, but I find it hard work to see the bus times. Howard Parker, who spotted the sign and is 5ft 9, said the information board was so high up it was almost useless . 'After studying it for a while I got a real crick in my neck. 'You would have to be 7ft tall not to have to crane your neck. 'I don’t know how anyone smaller than me or with worse eyesight is going to be able to see any of the information. 'The timetable is the normal small print and is going to be very, very hard for anyone to read if the information they need is at the top of the timetable. 'I really don’t know why anyone would put an information board up so high on a lamppost. 'It just doesn’t make any sense at all. 'The timetable is supposed to be there to help people but it’s not going to be much help if people can’t read the information, is it?' Mr Parker spotted the notice when he was helping to cut the hedge at a church in the street. He said he thought the shape of the lamppost, which has a 'bulge' on the lower part, might be the reason behind the placement. However, he said: 'If they can’t put the timetable on any lower because of the shape of the lamppost, then surely it is better not to put it on at all. 'It is just no good to anyone as it is.' Keith Myatt- spokesman for Arriva Bus -  said the company had an occasional problem with people moving timetables on lampposts. 'It sounds as if someone has pushed the timetable up the lamppost,' he said.

"By . Philip Quinn . One team is headed for the World Cup finals, the other for the beach. But the gulf between the Republic of Ireland and Portugal is wider than the Atlantic Ocean they have crossed for their friendly in the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on Tuesday morning. Portugal are ranked fourth in the world, with Ireland provisionally ranked 70 places lower — a gap in class that Martin O’Neill’s makeshift crew will struggle to bridge. It wasn’t always like this but the rivalry of the 2002 World Cup qualifiers, which saw two draws, and the friendly win for Ireland in 2005, seems a distant haze now. Opposition: Republic of Ireland manager Martin O'Neill hopes Portugal provide a challenge . Player-wise, Portugal have  Ronaldo as their poster boy while Ireland have Robbie Keane, a Ronaldo fan to the extent he voted for him as FIFA World Player of the Year. Everyone thinks highly of Ronaldo, who will figure after overcoming injury, and even Roy Keane holds his former Manchester United colleague in high esteem as ‘a player and person’, according to O’Neill. In a city of stars, few are burning brighter than Ronaldo, who is the chief reason 50,000 fans are  converging on East Rutherford (7.45pm local time). They expect to see the gaily bedecked Portuguese galleons scuttle the hand-crafted Irish currachs in a froth of goals. And even O’Neill, by instinct an optimist, is aware of the challenge confronting his under-strength side. ‘I would imagine this probably would be our toughest game of these four,’ he said. ‘Obviously, Portugal in their last game before the World Cup — I don’t know what way they will approach it and whether they would risk Ronaldo in the game — but for us, it’s still a big test. ‘I would just like to finish on a high if we can and to get a really good performance, something akin to the Italian performance, and to try to finish the off-season on a decent note.’ Anticipation: Cristiano Ronaldo is expected to return to the Portugal line-up for the game . O’Neill is eager that Ronaldo plays, which may be courting trouble. ‘He is one of the top two players in the world. He’s just a brilliant, brilliant player,’ he added. ‘We had a few problems the other night (against Costa Rica) at the beginning of the second half of the game for about 15 or 20 minutes when (Joel) Campbell came out wide and caused us a few problems, so you could imagine Ronaldo being in that sort of form. ‘It should be great for us to want to go and play against him. I think the players want him to be playing in the game so they can go and test themselves. I think a game like this benefits the younger players to be around the senior lads and encourages them not to be fearful when it comes to the big matches.’ Technical ability: Wes Hoolahan could be recalled from the bench and his passing style could trouble Portugal . O’Neill, who will attend Portugal’s opening World Cup Group G game against Germany next Monday, could do with a positive result as one win in six games has seen the Irish ranking plummet. ‘We just keep dropping down, don’t we?’ he said, before adding a light touch. ‘I told you, we’re going to choose some new countries at home to play in the middle of our season, and their off-season, and we’ll try and force a 1-0 win. ‘It’ll raise us up those rankings, to give us a chance in the 2028 World Cup, you know.’ O’Neill was guarded about his selection yesterday but his back five will consist entirely of  Championship players, which would be a worry. Wes Hoolahan is expected to return after being on the bench against Costa Rica and his svelte passing game, may unhinge the Portuguese defence. Unconcerned: O'Neill made light of Ireland's dramatic drop in the FIFA rankings to 70th place . O’Neill didn’t regard it as  coincidence that Hoolahan didn’t start the two games where Ireland lacked a creative sparkle, against Poland and Costa Rica. ‘I don’t think that is the case, I don’t look at it like that. When I get back home and really analyse things, then there might be a  pattern. But I have not looked that deeply into it.’ Robbie Keane is eager to play and put his penalty aberration against Costa Rica behind him. ‘It’s gone. That’s the way it goes. I’m not one to dwell on things,’ said Keane. ‘You want to score. When you don’t you feel you let people down but you’ ve got to get on with it. After the game it was forgotten. If he goes the other way, is it a good  penalty? Listen, he saved it, that’s the way it goes.’ Would he take one tomorrow if on the field? ‘Of course,’ he said. Uncharacteristic: Robbie Keane is not overly upset by his penalty miss for Ireland against Costa Rica . O’Neill has a concern over the  fitness of Shane Long who has a back problem and took it easy in training yesterday where a lightweight squad was joined by Ryan Meara, the 23-year-old reserve  goalkeeper for New York Red Bulls, who is eligible for the Republic through his Irish grandfather. ‘It was the first time I saw him live and I’d need to see a bit more of him, obviously,’ said O’Neill. ‘Seamus (McDonagh) has put a couple of DVDs in front of my nose which I haven’t had a chance to look at properly. ‘It would be very hard to make an assessment today on a 15-minute each-way game. But I’ll definitely keep an eye on him,’ he added. The courting of Meara highlights the shortage of top class keepers and puts the position of David Forde in focus, especially after a slightly uncertain contribution against Costa Rica. Forde has thrived on the big occasions, such as against Italy 10 days ago when he was busy early on. He may be busier for a lot longer against Portugal. Under threat: David Forde's place in the Ireland goal is by no means assured after some shaky displays .","Republic of Ireland manager looking forward to tough Portugal test .

"By . Matt Lawton . Follow @@Matt_Lawton_DM . Greg Dyke has branded England’s opening World Cup encounter with Italy as the game from hell for Roy Hodgson’s side. While the FA chairman stopped short of publicly declaring that Hodgson’s job is safe whatever happens here in Brazil, he did stress how difficult a group England face. At the draw last December Dyke memorably made a throat-cutting gesture when England found themselves in the same group as Italy, Uruguay and Costa Rica, and he was reminded of that yesterday. VIDEO: Scroll down for FA chairman Greg Dyke makes a throat-slitting gesture . Feeling the heat: England's Luke Shaw is sprayed down during training . Cutthroat: Greg Dyke's infamous gesture during the World Cup draw last December . ‘The gesture was a joke,’ he said. ‘But we sat there and said there were two things we didn’t want. We didn’t want Italy and we didn’t want Manaus, and we got both!’ In the past Dyke has said Hodgson’s job is safe irrespective of England’s results. That his contract runs until Euro 2016 in France and that he will continue in charge until then. Indeed Alex Horne, the FA general secretary, has said the same. On Tuesday, Dyke would not quite commit to that position. ‘I’ve got a lot of time for Roy,’ he said. ‘I’m a big fan.’ But asked if Hodgson would remain England manager regardless of what happens, Dyke said: ‘Well who knows? He’s contracted to. ‘We wouldn’t want to discuss what happens to him afterwards because this is the moment when things should be going well. So it’s not appropriate to discuss that now. But I’m a big fan of Roy’s. ‘I would say we would obviously hope to get out of the group and then after that… . ‘But it’s a tough group. I think one of the reasons we are coming here with less expectation is because it’s such a tough group. I was looking at the French group the other day.

Warming up: England's opponents Italy in training in Mangaratiba, Brazil . The French might not appreciate the sentiment and Dyke’s take on Brazil as hosts could offend the hosts. Even if what he said had a ring of truth about it. ‘What I’m surprised about this city is the fact that you wouldn’t know there is a World Cup going on,’ he said. ‘I’m told there’s all sorts of politics. There is real concern about the protesters. Some people don’t want Brazil to win because they don’t want the government to get re-elected. ‘The only reason you’d know there’s a World Cup here is because half the people are on strike and you can’t get from the airport. ‘The people I’ve been talking to are of the view that it’s very quiet. It does bring up the question for the future, because clearly there are a lot of people in this country who think too much money has been spent when there are extremes of poverty.’","Dyke has branded England encounter with Italy as the game from hell .

"By . Martin Samuel - Sport . Roy Hodgson looked up at the giant, black-and-white image and scowled. It was of an older man, smart, distinguished, quite a dramatic portrait in its way. His suit is sharp, his white shirt crisp, his classic striped tie perfectly fixed. The lines on his face, his wedding ring, suggest experience and wisdom. His demeanour suggests business-like confidence, yet without noticeable aggression. VIDEO: Scroll down for Hodgson: We'll have to wait and see what Manaus brings . Suits you: Roy Hodgson fits the role of England manager after a long and distinguished career . Calm: One of his most impressive feats has been to create a harmonious training camp environment . ‘I hate that,’ said Hodgson, glaring at his photograph. He sat down beneath it, a casual, unassuming figure in a grey T-shirt and tracksuit bottoms. This is Hodgson as he prefers to be seen. ‘The team that wins this World Cup,’ he said, ‘will not necessarily do so because of managerial excellence. It will be because they have very good footballers and work together. It’s players that count, at the end of the day.’ Hodgson isn’t quite as without ego as he would like the world to believe – no boss can be, by definition – but his discomfort over the heroic projection of his features is real. ‘It has been decided by the sponsors,’ he said. ‘They want to animate everywhere we go. If you were to ask the question, “would I like to see it removed?” the answer is “absolutely”. But unfortunately...’ – and he pivoted in his chair to stare helplessly again – ‘... there it is.’ Hodgson plays the modern game of branding and commerce and embarks on the standard rounds of media inquest but, deep down, there is an old-fashioned football man screaming to get out and coach. This is his second World Cup and his first was 20 years ago in the United States when as manager of Switzerland he negotiated a tricky group until an unsuccessful reckoning with Spain in the last 16. Those were different days. For a start, Hodgson was almost unknown in his own land. Still got it: Hodgson strikes a ball with his right peg in training . Feeling the heat: The England manager watches on as his players rehydrate during a session . A Football Association-schooled coach but without professional pedigree as a player, he had left England at a young age for a manager and had barely returned. His success was abroad, in unfashionable Sweden and then Switzerland. When England failed to qualify for the 1994 tournament it created a bubble of domestic interest, further piqued when Hodgson was appointed coach of Inter Milan, but it has ebbed and flowed since. Hodgson appeared destined to orbit English football, certainly its national team. And then came the appointment of the current Club England management board – two accountants, one media man and Sir Trevor Brooking to do the football – and Hodgson’s understated values were suddenly in vogue. They wanted an English manager, but with the CV of a foreign coach, and an aversion to controversy. The prophet was no longer without honour in his own country. Clearly, there is vindication in Hodgson being here now. Equally, it would be an act of utmost vanity to make the most eagerly anticipated World Cup of the modern era all about him. On Saturday he will name the most significant England XI since the match with Germany in Bloemfontein. So Hodgson trod the sensible path. He acknowledged the journey on his way to this moment, without elevating its importance above the next game. ‘I certainly never thought I was a pioneer, but I can’t remember feeling resentful either,’ he said. ‘I suppose because in the countries where I was working, particularly Sweden and Switzerland and, then, to some extent Italy, I was getting more than enough attention, and even acclaim. 'So I never thought, “This should be done in England.” I think I just accepted the fact that I left very young, totally unknown and I was just pleased to be able to fulfil an ambition to become a recognised and appreciated coach. 'I’m really happy to be with England now. It’s part of my birthright as an Englishman although I never thought much about destiny.’ Throwback: Hodgson leads the Swiss team in training at the Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan in June 1994 . Football Italia: With Inter players (from left) Gianluca Pagliuca, Ivan Zamorano and Fabio Galente in 1999 . Switzerland in 1994 were a very different proposition. Little was expected of them – although the cowbells carried by their fans made the most noise in the tournament – and it would not have been hard for Hodgson to keep his adopted nation happy. Just one look at the giant media facility at England’s Urca training base shows that England expects, despite the managing of expectations. Once here, it is impossible for England to play the shrinking violets and Hodgson knows it. This is a team built from players in one of the richest leagues in the world, household names some of them, and while there may be less chuckle-headed optimism than has infested previous campaigns, come Saturday a defeat by Italy will not be viewed as par for any course. ‘I think I feel calmer, more in control than I did in 1994,’ Hodgson said. ‘It’s always very difficult to analyse or describe yourself. You hope you’ve evolved in some way and that in all the experiences over that time you’re improving rather than deteriorating – not just as a coach but a human being. 'The professional danger is that you lose some of your enthusiasm, your energy and vitality in those 20 years. I would like to think I haven’t and that I’m a better manager now than then. 'I’ve had more help this time, certainly. I feel that our set-up, technically, physically, administration-wise, is much better than I had in 1994 – but I think every country would say that.’ Not that Hodgson has reason to be anything other than grateful to the Swiss. His success there led to him being appointed manager of Inter Milan, which gave him a second spell at the club as a caretaker in 1999. Dictator: To stop Italy, England need to stop their midfield orchestrator Andrea Pirlo . Panenka'd: Pirlo dinking a penalty past Joe Hart during the Euro 2012 quarter-final shootout . It was there that he met the man England must nullify in Manaus on Saturday, Italy’s playmaker Andrea Pirlo. The Italian wrote in his autobiography that Hodgson mispronounced his name as Pirla, which translates as dickhead, to general hilarity. In doing so, Pirlo said, ‘perhaps Hodgson understood my true nature more than the other managers’. ‘I’ve heard this story, but I think he may have used a bit of poetic licence there,’ Hodgson smiled. ‘I called him Andrea, for the most part. I never use surnames. 'I don’t ever remember referring to him as Pirlo – I’m a Christian name person. Maybe Andrea and Pirla sound similar. Certainly he was anything other than a ‘pirla’. He was great. ‘I felt a bit sorry for him, actually. He hadn’t played much because the squad was full of number tens, and that was how he was regarded at the time.

He didn’t play that much but I thought he was very good in training, a wonderful talent, and Carlo Ancelotti showed a stroke of genius when he went to AC Milan. 'Inter let him go, so they obviously didn’t fully believe in him, and Carlo transformed him into a deep lying midfield player rather than a real number ten and that’s when he started to blossom.’ It is at times like this that Hodgson becomes that man in the picture, the times when he can talk about some of the greatest names in the European game from personal experience. It hasn’t all been West Bromwich Albion and Viking Stavanger. ‘Don’t read too much into that,’ he said, with one final glance at the immaculate and dignified figure on the wall.

Bedene, ranked 132 in the world, has lived in Britain since 2008 but represented Slovenia in three previous ties. Evans, ranked 139, said: ‘He’s played Davis Cup for a different country so I just don’t think it would be right if he played Davis Cup for our country. It’s like in football, he’s already been capped for another country. Upset: Dan Evans has blasted Aljaz Bedene's hopes of playing for Great Britain in the Davis Cup . ‘But I’d say I’m a better player anyway so it shouldn’t be a selection issue.’ Evans crashed out of Queen’s in straight sets, 6-2, 6-3, to Kevin Anderson. The South African was too strong and brutally accurate, breaking Evans in his first service game and dominating him thereafter, serving 10 aces, compared to just two from the Briton. ‘I just didn’t get chance to play,’ said Evans. He lasted just 65 minutes against Anderson and fellow Briton James Ward lasted only two minutes longer as he fell to Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov, who was cheered to a 7-5, 6-3 victory by his girlfriend Maria Sharapova.

The song has been a let down for many Brazilians, who complain that it sounds too generic for the nation's Bossa Nova-crazed audiences and that it features foreign musicians singing mostly in English and Spanish. Leitte sings only a few seconds at the end of the song in her native Portuguese. 'J-Lo' announced her split from long-term boyfriend Casper Smart earlier this week.

"By . David Kent . Every day Sportsmail takes a look at the European papers to see what are the biggest stories creating talking points on the continent. Reports in Germany and Spain suggest that long-term Manchester United target Toni Kroos is on the verge of joining Real Madrid. Respected German paper Bild, report that talks between Bayern Munich and Real are at an advanced stage and that the Spanish giants have offered the midfielder a contract worth £4million (5m euros) a year before tax. Back off! Carlo Ancelotti has said keeper Iker Casillas is happy at Real while Barcelona close in on Ivan Rakitic . In Spain, El Confidencial, have extra detail on the move and claim that Real are just waiting to hear back from the 24-year-old's agent Volker Struth. The news will be a blow to Manchester United who have long been linked with the midfielder and it was only a few days ago that El Confidencial reported that Louis van Gaal had personally called Kroos to convince him to come to Old Trafford. Elsewhere in Spain, AS splash with quotes from Real boss Carlo Ancelotti saying that Arsenal target Iker Casillas is happy to stay at the Bernabeu. Arsene Wenger wanted to sign the keeper to bolster his options at the back after Lukas Fabianski signed for Swansea. But Ancelotti said: 'Casillas is very happy to stay here and we are very happy that he wants to stay.' Italian job: Ciro Immobile could start against England on Saturda after his hat-trick last week . Reunion: Ancelotti wants to bring Verratti to Real . Sport and Mundo Deportivo, meanwhile, both lead with the news that Barcelona are closing in on Croatian midfielder Ivan Rakitic. In Italy, La Gazzetta dello Sport suggest that Real want Paris Saint Germain midfielder Marco Verratti, who Ancelotti signed during his spell with the French champions. They also ask the question: (Ciro) Immobile or (Mario) Balotelli? After Immobile's hat-trick last week, coach Cesare Prandelli has a dilemma who to start up front. But the daily paper suggest Balotelli is still in pole position and that Prandelli doesn't see them playing together. Corriere dello Sport boldly declare that Italian fans want Immobile to start up top but Prandelli will go with Balotelli for Saturday's opening World Cup game against England. Tuttosport take a slightly different angle and ask why Torino and Juventus decided to sell Immobile - who signed for Bourssia Dortmund earlier this month in a £15.6m deal. They also carry quotes from former Juventus and Crystal Palace star Attilio Lombardo saying: '(Didier) Drogba and (Carlos) Tevez, what a partnership.' Could the Italian giants be lining up a move for the former Chelsea striker? L’Equipe say Newcastle have offered French striker Bafetimbi Gomis a four-year deal worth £290,000 (€370,000) a year in wages, plus a £2m (€2.5m) performance bonus plan.

"By . Jonny Singer . The whole of Brazil had their hearts in their mouths as star forward Neymar went down with an ankle injury during training, sparking doubts about his World Cup fitness. The Barcelona star rolled his ankle during the selecao's training session outside Rio de Janeiro forcing him to receive treatment on the pitch. However, after spending some time on the floor, the World Cup's poster-boy was able to pick himself up and walk gingerly away. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch the moment Neymar's ankle caused panic in Brazil . Anguish: Neymar looks in real pain as he goes down clutching at his right ankle . Sigh of relief: Neymar looks set to be fit to face Croatia in the World Cup's opening game on Thursday . Nervy moment: Neymar (far left) rolls his right ankle while running in Brazil's evening training session . Neymar was soon able to resume training and looks set to be fit to take his place in the starting line-up on against Croatia on Thursday. Meanwhile, Brazil have been paying extra attention to their defence ahead of the opening game. Manager Luiz Felipe Scolari spent part of the team's training session on Monday making adjustments to his  defensive setup, stopping practice several times to reposition players until he was satisfied. Although Brazil didn't concede a goal in their two warm-up matches, Scolari said he was not completely satisfied with how his squad played defensively. In doubt? Neymar had been playing a full part in the training session up until the injury . Star man: Brazil's hopes at their home World Cup rest squarely on the shoulders of the Barcelona forward . One of the coach's main goals in the last week of preparations was to make sure the team ready defensively in time for the opener. 'We know that if we don't concede goals, our chances to win matches increase, because we know the kind of talent we have in attack,'; said Scolari. 'It's important we are well prepared on defense so we are not caught by surprise.' Right back Daniel Alves acknowledged that Brazil's defence isn't perfect, but said the team is working to improve before the opener. When told that Croatia striker Ivica Olic said he saw spaces in Brazil's defense during the warm-up matches, Alves acknowledged that adjustments still have to be made. Concern: Neymar receives medical attention during a training session at the squad's complex . Pressure: Brazil are just two days away from starting the World Cup in their home nation . Careful: Paulinho (right) and Fernandinho take part in during a training session . 'Obviously, if we didn't make mistakes, we would be a perfect team, and that's not possible,' the Barcelona defender said. 'If Olic saw spaces, then we have to make sure we fix that so he can't find them anymore.' The last time Brazil conceded a goal was in a 2-1 win over Chile in a friendly last November. Brazil beat Panama 4-0 and Serbia 1-0 last week in the last two matches before for the opening match in Sao Paulo. 'Physically we are ready, but tactically we still have to adjust a few things,' Scolari said. The coach's other main focus during Monday's training was on set pieces - another area where he said Brazil still needs to improve. Brazil are expected to practice again at its training camp outside Rio de Janeiro on Tuesday before traveling to Sao Paulo later in the day for the opener.","Barcelona star turns his ankle during Brazil training .

"By . David Kent . Leeds have been ordered to repay a loan of nearly £1million by the High Court after being served with a winding-up petition. The Sky Bet Championship club could be wound up if the debt - a £950,000 loan - is not paid. However, a barrister representing the club told a hearing before a registrar at the High Court in London that payment could be 'made very quickly'. Resolve: Leeds United have undergone an incredibly unsettled season . The power: Leeds owner Massimo Cellino . Another hearing of the case is scheduled for June 23. The registrar was told that money Leeds owed to the taxman had already been paid - that amount was not disclosed. 'The club wants time to pay,' Rory Brown, for Leeds, told Deputy Registrar Chris Garwood at the hearing in the Companies Court - which is part of the High Court. 'The payment can made be very quickly.' Lawyers said Leeds' owner Massimo Cellino had paid money owed to HM Revenue & Customs. And Mr Garwood told the hearing: 'There is nothing which prevents him paying this debt if he doesn't wish the company to be wound up.' Mr Garwood heard that the money had been loaned by a company set up by the club's former managing director David Haigh. The company, Sport Capital, had complained that it had not been paid and had launched a winding up petition. Leeds on Tuesday argued that the petition should be 'struck out'. Lawyers said the money was loaned by Mr Haigh not by the company, and said the company was 'not a creditor'. Unpopular: Leeds supporters have been vociferous in the opposition of their new owner . Wound up: Former Leeds striker El-Hadji Diouf was always fairly easy to wind up . They suggested that the winding up petition had been launched to 'exert pressure' on the club.And Mr Brown said the club was in the process of investigating whether it had been ""defrauded"" by Mr Haigh. He said the club was concerned that it may be 'in receipt of stolen money'. Mr Garwood dismissed Leeds' application for the winding up petition to be struck out. He concluded that Sport Capital had loaned Leeds the money and said the club was 'scratching around'. He dismissed Leeds' concerns about being in receipt of 'stolen money' - saying there had been no findings of criminality.","Leeds ordered to repay loan of nearly £1million by the High Court .

"By . Matt Barlow . Follow @@Matt_Barlow_DM . The last thing England need is Andrea Pirlo with added inspiration, but the Italian playmaker is plotting a meeting today with Brazil’s free-kick maestro Juninho Pernambucano, the man he studied to perfect his own dead-ball style. Juninho, who spent eight years in Europe at Lyon, has been invited to Italy’s training base two hours west of Rio de Janeiro to meet Pirlo, who wrote in his autobiography how he would spend hours scrutinising the Brazilian’s free-kick technique. ‘That man made the ball do some quite extraordinary things,’ wrote Pirlo. ‘He never went wrong. Never. I checked out his stats and realised it couldn’t just be chance.’ VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Andrea Pirlo prepare for England with some trick shots . The master: Juninho Pernambucano has been brought into offer Pirlo advice on his free-kicks . Idol: Pirlo wrote in his autobiography that he had studied the Brazilian's technique . Pirlo scoured video clips and old photographs of Juninho in action and eventually cracked the puzzle. ‘The search for Juninho’s secret had become an obsession with me,’ he confessed, but he did finally unearth the magic formula. ‘It was all about how he struck the ball, not where,’ he added. ‘Only three of his toes came into contact with the ball, not the whole foot.’ Pirlo was the architect of England’s Euro 2012 downfall in Kiev, dictating a game his team somehow failed to win in 120 minutes of total domination before scoring in the penalty shootout with a ‘Panenka-style’ chip against Joe Hart. He will again be a central figure in Manaus, where the heat and humidity will make possession more valuable than ever. Key: Italy have not been at their best in the warm-ups, but Pirlo will strike fear into the English team . Mario Balotelli should face England on Saturday with an extra spring in his step after announcing his engagement to model Fanny Neguesha. She posted the news on Instagram, along with a snap of her new ring. ‘There are two different styles of play: Italy more technical and England more physical,’ said Juventus’s Claudio Marchisio. This feeling supports the quiet confidence in evidence at Casa Azzurri, the Italian World Cup camp, in Mangaratiba, steaming yesterday after hours of rain. Marchisio appears in good shape heading into the World Cup. Yet he smiled when this suggestion was put to him, shook his head and dabbed his brow with a napkin. ‘It is so hot,’ he said. Cesare Prandelli’s side have not won since September and failed to beat Luxembourg last week, yet this is shrugged off as a typically Italian form of preparation. Prandelli is vexed by the team’s defensive frailties, which is leading him towards fielding a single striker. Specialist: Juninho's free-kicks were his trademark in a career during which he earned 40 caps for Brazil . Pirlo's Panenka: The deep-lying playmaker embarrassed Joe Hart with a cheeky chip at Euro 2012 . Confident: Claudio Marchisio believes Italy will flourish despite less than convincing preparations . Even when winning a practice match against Fluminense on Sunday — a game beamed into England’s hotel for the benefit of Roy Hodgson and his coaches — the Italians conceded three goals. Centre half Giorgio Chiellini was not risked because injury was such an unbearable thought and his Juventus team-mate Andrea Barzagli is managing a sore heel. He is expected to start against England but could be rested for Costa Rica as Prandelli plans for a potentially crucial final group game with Uruguay. A fever has ruled PSG’s Marco Verratti out of training for three days, fuelling fears he may miss Saturday’s game in Manaus, but traditionally Italy are seldom more dangerous than when approaching a big tournament in utter disarray. Russia beat Italy 3-0 ahead of Euro 2012 and still Prandelli’s team reached the final. The world titles of 2006 and 1982 were won while corruption scandals raged at home. ‘That is a very dangerous route to go down,’ declared Hodgson last week, when he detected optimism infiltrating the English press corps after the Luxembourg result. Wary: Roy Hodgson agreed with Marchisio that the Italians should not be judged on their friendly results . Doubtful: PSG midfielder Marco Veratti is struggling to be fit for the England game on Saturday . Italy don’t do friendlies, was basically Hodgson’s argument and it was echoed by Marchisio. ‘We know we have put hard work into our legs in these preparation games,’ said the Juve midfielder. ‘We will be OK. Against England, it’s always a great match. England are a different team from two years ago, but we have changed, too. We have more experience. This will talk on the pitch.’ At Casa Azzurri, briefings with Marchisio and Napoli striker Lorenzo Insigne were followed by pasta, espresso and the deep notes of a Bontempi organ which drowned out the competitive noise of several table football games. Italy are quietly confident ahead of what they view as the pivotal game in the group. Win this and a draw will be enough against Uruguay. That, at least, is the theory and that is before Juninho Pernambucano pops in to give Pirlo a lift.","Italian midfield studied Brazilian's technique .

Hodgson included young, inexperienced players like Luke Shaw, Ross Barkley and Raheem Sterling in his 23-man squad for Brazil, a tactic which Gattuso feels will hinder England's chances of success. He said: 'I don’t really agree with Hodgson’s youth policy. Experience – it’s not something you buy at Tesco. 'It’s something you earn, bit by bit, and it matters because I am dead sure that, when youngsters are there listening to the national anthem, their legs will be shaking. 'And, in those cases, you need expert players. Without experience, it can really be tough.' Azzurri: Gattuso won 73 caps for Italy and was part of the side that won the World Cup in 2006 .

Gattuso also revealed that he expects Wayne Rooney to star in Brazil, despite struggling to find his best form in the run-up to the World Cup and having never scored in his previous two appearances at the tournament. He said: 'Personally, I expect a big World Cup from Wayne Rooney because this season he has been ­experiencing ups and downs and this World Cup can be the ­occasion to cement his place in history.' 'Generally speaking, I think that every player like Gerrard or Lampard, who are 35-36 years old, when facing that humidity, must really be careful.

The 27-year-old Harlequins scrum half was ruled out of the series opener at Eden Park last weekend in unfortunate circumstances, following a freak training-ground accident. Care hurt himself after attempting a low kick only to miss the ball and fall awkwardly – prompting wild amusement among team-mates and coaches until his predicament became clear. Back to fitness: Danny Care, training indoors on Monday in Auckland, is set to return for England on Saturday . Freak accident: The Harlequins' scrum half fell while kicking ahead of the first Test and injured his shoulder . In his absence, Ben Youngs of Leicester started in the No 9 shirt in the first Test, but he was unable to deliver a fluent performance and there is a strong chance that Care will now be brought straight back into England’s starting XV. His outstanding displays during the Six Nations will no doubt count in his favour as Stuart Lancaster and his assistant coaches finalise their selection prior to the official team announcement on Thursday morning local time. Should the exuberant Yorkshireman reclaim his place, he will resume his half-back partnership with Owen Farrell and the Saracens No 10 gave an emphatic endorsement of his qualities. ‘I played with Danny for the first time in the Six Nations and loved it,' he said. ‘He's obviously a world-class player and someone who can take any opportunity that comes.

Danny's a brilliant player.’ Farrell was asked if he and others destined to replace players who performed so well in narrow defeat at Eden Park feel guilty about doing so. Taking chances: Ben Youngs deputised for Care at No 9 but didn't make the mark he would have hoped . In form: Care was impressive in the Six Nations and for Quins in their late-season charge into the finals . He said: ‘I don't know about guilty. They'll want to do it justice. ‘Any time you pull that shirt on you wanted to do yourself justice and you do that by performing. Everyone wanted those who played on Saturday to do well. In this camp the team comes first. 'It's not about us as individuals; it's about what's best for us as a team.’ England must win at the Forsyth Barr Stadium on Saturday in order to keep this three-match series alive and Farrell described it as a ‘massive’ occasion on that basis. The tourists will go into it full of renewed conviction that the All Blacks are beatable. ‘They're the best team in the world for a reason,’ said Farrell. ‘What they've done over the last two years has been unbelievable. We want to challenge ourselves against them because ultimately that's where we want to be, but we have a huge sense of self-belief and back ourselves against anybody.’ Late blow: The World Champion All Blacks beat England with a try at the death in the corner from Conrad Smith .","Care missed the first Test after suffering a freak shoulder injury in training .

"By . Charlie Scott . Holland midfielder Wesley Sneijder is literally fighting fit for the start of the World Cup after enlisting the help of kickboxer Gokhan Saki to get him into shape. The Dutch maestro was given permission by his club Galatasaray and national team coach Louis Van Gaal to train with Saki in Istanbul, where he is based during the domestic season. And the results have been remarkable, with Holland’s physios in disbelief at Sneijder’s high level of fitness when the national side got together at the end of May. Trainer: Gokhan Saki (left) poses with Dutch star Wesley Sneijder in Istanbul . Going Dutch: Sneijder (right) claims he is fighting fit and ready for the 2014 World Cup . ‘Thanks to him, I got back to my optimal weight, like when I was 22,’ said Sneijder. ‘In terms of footwork and agility, I am back to my old level. ‘It was explosive training,’ said Sneijder. ‘It has made me more explosive over the first few metres. I feel that I have benefited from it. ‘However, I have not got fit just through the workouts [with Saki]. I also played a lot of matches after the winter break.’ When Van Gaal began his second spell in charge of Holland in 2012 he took the captain’s armband from Sneijder and gave it to Robin van Persie. Careful: The Dutch maestro is tackled Nigel de Jong during a Holland training session . And last year the 29-year-old was dropped by Van Gaal, prompting serious doubts over whether he would be recalled for this summer’s tournament. ‘With hindsight I can see that Van Gaal was right,’ agreed Sneijder. ‘I was not working enough. My level had gone down.’ Earlier this month Van Gaal welcomed Sneijder’s return to fitness but added, ‘he must prove that he can again be the superb player he was in 2010.’ The Galatasaray midfielder won further praise from Van Gaal during their training camp in Portugal last week. Prepared: Louis van Gaal gave Sneijder permission to train with Saki in Instanbul . ‘I read that it was thanks to me, but it’s really thanks to him,’ said van Gaal. ‘If he keeps this form, he can bring a lot to the team. ‘With him, Robben and van Persie, the Netherlands has one of the best potential strike forces in the world.’ In an interview with Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf, Saki explained how he had helped the former Inter Milan midfielder arrive at Holland’s training camp in peak physical condition. High spirits: Holland coach Van Gaal gestures to his players during a training session . ‘I’m really happy for him,’ said the 30-year-ol, who is a two-time Dutch and European Muay Thai champion. ‘A few months ago he was in a real slump, but now he is out of that. I hope and think he’s going to do well at the World Cup. He is one hundred per cent ready.’ Saki is flying to Brazil to assist Sneijder during the tournament. ‘I will take my training gear. When Wesley needs me, I am ready for him. But since he is physically in good shape, he will be able to focus.’","Wesley Sneijder prepared for the World Cup by training with kickboxer Gokhan Saki .

"By . Rob Robertson . After the frantic year Richie Gray has gone through, it isn’t surprising he is looking forward to a much-needed beach holiday with his model girlfriend Ellie McKeating after Scotland’s match against Canada. The big second row is desperate to finish a hectic — and sometimes turbulent — 12 months on a high with a win in Toronto on Saturday. Around this time last year, he was part of the victorious British and Irish Lions side that emerged victorious from Australia. Shortly afterwards, he was on a plane to France for pre-season training with his new club Castres, who he signed for from Sale Sharks. Last hurrah: Richie Gray (L) and Grant Gilchrist will play their final game of the season against Canada in Toronto . The end is nigh: Richie Gray trains for one last game before he heads of on holiday . Apart from a brief spell when he was inexplicably dropped by interim head coach Scott Johnson at the start of the Six Nations, he has hardly missed a game for club or country since — including starting for Castres as they narrowly lost to Toulon in the TOP14 play-off final two weeks ago. Following that match, he was straight on to a flight to North America from Paris to prepare for Scotland’s first match against the USA in Houston. An ankle injury in the first half to fellow lock Jim Hamilton — that has ended his tour — and a lack of other second-row options on the bench meant Gray had no choice but to play the whole 80 minutes in the searing heat. He will called upon again against the Canadians this weekend, where he will partner Grant Gilchrist, in what will be the final match of his busy rugby schedule.‘It is getting to that stage of the season when the boys, including me, are not feeling their freshest — but it is great to be with them, so I will enjoy it as much as I can when I am here,’ said Gray. ‘I have only one game left and I want to finish my season on a high with a win over Canada and after that I will be switching off from rugby for a while. Triumphant: Richie Gray was part of the British Lions team that emerged victorious from Australia last season . No cigar: Richie Gray came close to winning the TOP14 play-off final with new club Castres . ‘I am looking forward to lying on a beach for a couple of weeks as it will be good just to shut down completely from rugby because it has been pretty full on for a year. ‘I had the Lions tour last summer, the move to Castres and everything that has gone in between with Scotland. ‘I haven’t really had a chance to reflect on it all but I will after the Canada game that’s for sure. ‘Being with Scotland has been great because it’s a nice way to end what’s been an incredible year for me. It’s one I won’t forget, that’s for sure.’ Main man: Richie Gray has been earmarked as one of Scotland's most important players by Vern Cotter . The 24-year-old will shoulder more responsibility in the run-up to the 2015 Rugby World Cup. At Scotland training sessions this week, new head coach Vern Cotter has taken him aside to discuss privately what he expects from the man he has already earmarked as one of his important players. ‘Vern has been very involved with us this week and he wants us to play in a certain way and has been going through the drills in fine detail,’ revealed Gray. ‘He wants us constantly on the move, even in training, and although it’s been tough, I am really enjoying it so far.

"By . Chris Foy . Follow @@FoyChris . England narrowly lost 20-15 to New Zealand after a late try by Conrad Smith extended the Kiwi's unbeaten run at Eden Park to 20 years. Here, Sportsmail's Chris Foy rates the two teams and gives his verdict on which England players deserve to start next week's second Test in Dunedin. ENGLAND . Mike Brown - 7Not his stellar best, often double tackled, but strong and feisty. VERDICT: Must start in Dunedin . Strength: Mike Brown wasn't at his best, but was a constant source of power for England . Marland Yarde - 7 . Tidy all-round game but rightly yellow carded late in second half. VERDICT: Did enough to stay in . Manu Tuilagi - 8 . Looks fit, fresh and hungry. Big threat to New Zealand defence. VERDICT: I want him on left wing . Kyle Eastmond - 7 . Some really nice touches, laid down a marker for the future. VERDICT: Billy Twelvetrees if fit . Too strong: Manu Tuilagi (centre) is stopped by the All Black defence during the Test match . Jonny May - 6 . Curate’s egg. Some good moments, must adapt to Test pace. VERDICT: Move Tuilagi to the wing . Freddie Burns - 7 . Composed, kicked his goals and justified Lancaster’s confidence. VERDICT: Farrell to start if fit . In the mix: Both Kyle Eastmond and Freddie Burns were in impressive form at Eden Park . Ben Youngs - 6 . Busy against top opponent. Second fumble nearly cost England dear. VERDICT: Danny Care returns if fit . Substitutes - 7 . Not a massive factor but Cipriani got on the front foot and kicked his penalty with aplomb. Joe Marler - 7 . Solid evening’s work and that short fuse seemed well under control. VERDICT: Good to go again . Battle: Joe Marler (centre) is tackled by Liam Messam (left) and Richie McCaw during England's defeat . Rob Webber - 7 . A standout effort. Good in the tight and line-out, extra option in loose. VERDICT: Dylan Hartley to return . David Wilson - 6 . Strong in scrum but oddly prone to fumbles for a good handler. VERDICT: Good to go again . Joe Launchbury - 7 . Good in the line-out, worked with calm efficiency. So reliable. VERDICT: One of the first names on the team sheet . Safe hands: Joe Launchbury was strong in the line-out on Saturday . Geoff Parling - 7 . Fine return after long time out of Tests. Ran line-out intelligently. VERDICT: Lawes to come back . James Haskell - 7 . Finished strongly for Wasps and maintained that form here. VERDICT: Tom Wood is first choice . Chris Robshaw (capt) - 8 . One of his best performances - and against McCaw as well. VERDICT: Will lead from front again . Ben Morgan - 7 . Very fine effort, carried very well and gave England go-forward. VERDICT: ...but Vunipola returns . Leader: England skipper Chris Robshaw (centre) put in one of his best performances . NEW ZEALAND . Israel Dagg - 6 . One slashing run in attack but unusually error-prone for such a quality player. Ben Smith - 7 . Made up for earlier handling errors with that brilliant try-scoring pass at the death. Conrad Smith - 8 . The old head knew exactly what was required in the 79th minute to score his try. Experienced: Conrad Smith scored the crucial 79th minute try for New Zealand . Ma’a Nonu - 6 . Not at his best by any means. Should have been yellow-carded for shirt-tugging early on. Cory Jane - 6 . Quiet night, few chances to shine, which is a testament to England’s pressure game. Aaron Cruden - 7 . Not without error but a very accomplished stand-in for the resting Dan Carter. Aaron Smith - 8 . Livewire, clever kicker, speedy delivery. New Zealand’s best player on the night. Star man: Aaron Smith of the All Blacks was one of the best players on the pitch at Eden Park . Tony Woodcock - 6 . Veteran World Cup-winning prop but England had the better of the front-row exchanges. Dane Coles - 6 . Has bulked up but still struggling at scrum time. New Zealand scrum improved when he departed. Owen Franks - 6 . Had his hands full in the tight and not seen in the loose as much as usual. Missing: Dane Coles (centre) struggled to impose himself when it came to scrum time . Brodie Retallick - 7 . Made that long second-half break and considerable line-out force. Good player. Sam Whitelock - 7 . Unsung workhorse as ever but tough going against an aggressive England pack. Stopped: England managed Richie McCaw well and kept the New Zealand captain relatively quiet . Liam Messam - 6 . Came second-best to England at the tackle area. Could drop out if Read returns. Richie McCaw (capt) - 7 . Quiet by his immense standards. England power at breakdown helped negate him. Jerome Kaino - 7 . Not a natural No 8. Great athlete and driving force - but at blindside flanker.","England captain Chris Robshaw was at his very best against New Zealand .

"By . Ian Laybourn, Press Association . Leeds full-back Zak Hardaker has been given a five-match ban after being found guilty of homophobic abuse. The 22-year-old England international was also fined £300 by a Rugby Football League independent disciplinary tribunal which sat for almost four hours in Leeds. Hardaker, who was represented by his club's legal team, was charged with a grade E offence, which carries a suspension of between four and eight matches, after his offensive comments were spotted on television during Leeds' 24-6 defeat by Warrington 11 days ago. Disciplined: Zak Hardaker has been hit by a five-game ban . Hardaker last week issued an apology for his comments, admitting he used inappropriate language and insisted they were aimed at Warrington captain Michael Monaghan, rather than referee James Child, which appeared to be the case. 'I have complied fully with the RFL's investigation, never looked to deny what I said and will accept their judgement,' Hardaker said in his statement. Hardaker, who was thrown out of England's World Cup squad after a breach of discipline last November, has missed only one match for his club in the last 14 months but will now by sidelined until the middle of July. However, it could have been worse for the former Featherstone player. Although there is no direct precedent, former Wakefield hooker Tevita Leo-Latu was banned for six matches in 2007 for making a racist comment to Warrington winger Kevin Penny. And Castleford were fined £40,000, which was later halved on appeal, in 2010 after a section of their fans made homophobic chants at openly-gay player Gareth Thomas. Bad boy: Hardaker was thrown out of England's World Cup squad last year after a breach of discipline . The Tigers were found guilty of unacceptable behaviour, of breaching the RFL's Respect Policy, of misconduct by their supporters and of conduct prejudicial to the interests of the sport. Hardaker, who will start his suspension when Leeds host Huddersfield in a Super League game at Headingley on Thursday night, pledged to learn from his latest mistake. 'Thankyou everyone for ur support, 5 games it is,' he tweeted. 'You live and learn and that's life, so I'll just make sure I come out better for it.' Leeds have said they will stand by their player, with head coach Brian McDermott saying: 'We welcome the fact that Zak has recognised his mistake and we will work with him to make sure that this type of incident does not happen again in the future. Support: Brian McDermott says Leeds will stand by Hardaker . 'As a club and a game, we have always prided ourselves on how inclusive and welcoming our sport is and this incident, and the reaction to it, shows how seriously we all take this matter. 'We were pleased that the panel made a particular point of saying that they did not believe that Zak had meant his comment as a homophobic remark and that they considered that Zak was not homophobic. 'The club has worked hard to raise the issue of anti-homophobia in the past and we remain committed to working against all forms of discrimination.'","England star also fined £300 by RFL independent disciplinary tribunal .

"By . Sean Vincent . Not so long ago, if a race got physical, Laura Muir admits she would be left wondering what had hit her. Now, with yet another huge stride having just been taken on her impressively rapid and upward career trajectory, the 21-year-old insists she is more than capable of giving as good as she gets. The unwelcome blip of failing to make the 800 metres final at the World Indoor Championships in March seemed to have been well and truly forgotten earlier this week as Muir surveyed Hampden and the multi-coloured arena which will provide the stage for two landmark athletics meetings that could potentially send this modest shooting star into a different stratosphere. Ready to rumble: Laura Muir has toughened up for the Commonwealth Games . One, of course, is the Commonwealth Games, where she plans to contest both the 800m and 1500m. The other, which comes first, is the Diamond League meeting which will pitch up at the home of Scottish football on July 11 and 12. Muir – who clearly can’t wait to try out the revolutionary track - will run the 800m on that occasion and, in what will be a fascinating sub plot, so too will her compatriot Lynsey Sharp. The fact that both are finding form at just the right time means a Scottish head-to-head for honours is considerably more than just a remote a possibility. On Sunday, In the Dutch city of Hengelo, Muir took part in her first race of the outdoor season and promptly ran a 1500m personal best time of 4:02.91. At the same meeting Sharp, who has not had her injury troubles to seek, was also breaking new ground for herself – a time of 2:00:09 providing an 800m personal best and putting the European champion second in the Commonwealth rankings. Moving up a rung on the athletic ladder has to be hard-earned though and, even if it might not necessarily be part of her nature away from competition, Muir insists she is more than happy to fight her corner now when it comes to the dark arts of racing. ‘I remember during what was my first race of quite a high standard, at the BMC in Manchester, and I got spiked and pushed – I just came off the track thinking: “What have I been doing for the past seven years? This not what I’ve been doing!”,’ said the 21-year-old. Bouncing back: Muir has recovered from her disappointment at the World Indoor Championships . ‘I’ve learned a lot. It’s been a very steep learning curve over the past couple of years but it’s been really good, I enjoy it, and now I know to just shrug it off, get my elbows out and I’ll be fine.’ Those elbows had to be sharpened and put to good use in Hengelo, a race which provided just the sort of preparation and confidence boost to fuel Muir’s missions this summer. ‘It was just really good to be back racing,’ she said of her second-place finish. ‘I really enjoyed it. I was nice and relaxed and calm going into it. 'I stuck at the front and then just went with a couple of hundred to go. I felt really strong – there was a bit of elbowing and pushing on the home straight – but I managed to get past it and felt really good. ‘It’s strange because I am quite quiet but I think that certainly when I go out on the track it’s a flip of a switch. Friendly rivalry: Lynsey Sharp is also competing in the 800m . ‘But you’ve got to be (aggressive). I think if I wasn’t then I wouldn’t be where I am today. I think it does take a strong character to race and race well tactically. If you let other people intimidate you then that’s just not how to race really. 'You’ve just got to be really confident in yourself and that’s what I try to do. I just have to hold my position, which can be a bit hard when I’m a bit smaller than quite a lot of them, but I just know that I’ve got the ability so I know I have to be in the right place at the right time and I’ll be stronger than them in the finish.’ The good news is that Muir thinks there is plenty still to come from her. There is a calm certainty in her voice when she insists that her 1500m time will translate into her breaking the two-minute barrier for 800m. ‘I feel like I could have run faster (in Hengelo),’ she added. ‘The way my training is going, it (running under two minutes) should be on the cards. 'It’s quite a landmark for a distance runner to break that mark, even for guys. I’m not going to push for it though. Times come when they come. It depends on the race. Even though the 800m is not as variable, you might get a slower race. I never chase times but the time will come.’ Having such fierce competition from close to home in the form of Sharp will help keep motivation levels high, of course. So did Muir have sympathy for the 23-year-old at the weekend when she missed out so narrowly on ducking under 120 seconds? ‘I was delighted to see her back,’ said Muir. ‘And she took a half-second off her personal best. You can’t put any downers on that. You’re so close but, at the same time, you ran a PB. It’s great to see she’s back. She raced really well and I’m sure it will come. ‘Middle-distance running in Scotland is so good just now. It’s probably partly due to the competition.  It’s driving people to train even harder but it’s great to see so many athletes in the distance events. You’re not even guaranteed a spot on the Scotland team, never mind the GB team, which is really good.’ Dress rehearsal: Muir will appear in the Glasgow Grand Prix next month . Before national service, however, comes the Diamond League and another chance to sparkle in Glasgow. ‘It will really help because you get a sense of the atmosphere and what it’s going to be like,’ said Muir of the opportunity to sample competing in the famous venue. ‘Where the warm-up is and the call room and the layout and the surroundings. And the feel of the track as well. It’s hard for people to understand but some are faster than others. 'You can tell with some having longer straights and tighter bends. It will be nice to get out there and see what it’s like.’ Watch the world’s best athletes including Yohan Blake, MoFarah, Christine Ohuruogu, David Weir at the Sainsbury’s Glasgow Grand Prix on July 11-12.

"By . Kieran Gill . England look hell-bent on making no mistakes second time around when they face New Zealand at the Forsyth Barr Stadium this Saturday after their narrow yet proud defeat the week before. Stuart Lancaster put his team through their paces days after their agonisingly close 20-15 loss to the All Blacks at Eden Park and his players show no signs of surrendering the three-Test series. New Zealand won all 14 of their Test matches in 2013, becoming the first team in the professional era to do so, but were given a run for their money on Saturday by a weakened England side. Training: Danny Care put through his paces ahead of Saturday's second showdown against New Zealand . Chase: Henry Thomas runs with the ball during the training session at the Onewa Oval on Monday .

Round two: England prepare ahead of the second of their three-test series against the All Blacks . Pass: Billy Twelvetrees back in training after overcoming an ankle injury that ruled him out first time around . England had practically been written off pre-match as they prepared to take on the All Blacks but escaped with pride intact, and then some. They only went behind 10 minutes from time and will look to upset the script again by offering another tight, and often gruelling, match with their New Zealand counterparts. England have beaten the All Blacks just twice on their own patch - in 1973 and 2003 - but look as close as ever to adding a third this Saturday. And Lancaster will welcome his selection headache. As well as those that gave a compelling account of themselves at Eden Park on Saturday, the England head coach has returning players to consider. There are those such as Gloucester centre Billy Twelvetrees returning from injury that will look to earn their keep. There is also the likes of Northampton flanker Tom Wood back in contention after taking part in the Premiership final that clashed with the first Test on May 31.

"By . David Lloyd . The running out of Jos Buttler at Edgbaston was absolutely fine. I have no problem with it. There is no ‘Spirit of Cricket’ issue for me. Sachithra Senanayake had clearly warned Buttler about backing up too far - and according to the laws he doesn’t have to do that - and it doesn’t matter that he wasn’t charging down the pitch. The England man was out of his ground. Of course it was an unsavoury scene and everybody involved in the game would have wondered what they might have done. What you need is a strong captain who is able to step back and take the heat out of it. Controversial:  Sachithra Senanayake appeals to the umpire for a run out of Jos Buttler at the non strikers end . If it had been me in Angelo Mathews’ shoes, I might have gone up to the batsman and said, ‘Look, you’ve been warned and you’ve done it again. You have put me in a really difficult situation here because you are out. I might just give you one more chance but if you do it again I’m sending you packing.’ I don’t blame Mathews for not doing that but he could have bought himself time by having a look round at his senior players, because there was a lot of experience out there in former captains Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawardene and Tillekeratne Dilshan. But he decided to make the call himself and that’s fine. Things had been a bit tasty out there from the start, with the Sri Lankans questioning the umpires’ calling of wides.

"By . Louise Cheer . A heritage-listed home with a 150-year history is set to break property records at Sydney's Potts Point with an estimated price tag of $20 million. The 1,970-square-metre home at Potts Point not only boasts a rich past but six bedrooms, five bathrooms and six parking spaces. Advertised as a 'regency revival family estate', Jenner House was home to the brother of department store owner Anthony Horden, Lebbeus Hordern, and was built around 1868 by distinguished architect Edmund Blacket. The Potts Point home on Macleay Street is estimated to sell for about $20 million . The three-storey house was initially built as two storeys circa 1868 and was one of the late 19th century villas lining Potts Point . After Mr Horden, one of New South Wales' wealthiest men - John Thomas Nealk - who made his fortune as a clothes dealer took up residence in about 1875 and died at the address in 1897. It was also once occupied by King George V during his time in the Royal Navy. The Sydney Morning Herald reported the house currently holds the Potts Point record of highest selling residence of $15 million, which was set when it was sold to high-profile car dealer Terry Mullens and wife Wendy by horse trainer Tony Peterson in 2009. In Jenner House's history - which has spanned almost 150 years - it has been known as Stramshall Villa from about 1871 to 1879, Kurrahjeen from 1880 to 1885 and Lugano from 1888 to 1911. Its current name was bestowed on it in 1914. The three-storey house sits on parklands facing north-east with panoramic views of Sydney Harbour, with a circular driveway and a 600-square-metre forecourt garden complete with its own gatehouse. Despite its modern facilities, Jenner House - located on Macleay Street - still retains its colonial roots with 10 marble fireplaces, a grand cedar staircase, a colonnaded entrance foyer, four-metre high ceilings, cast-iron columns and lacy balconies. The home boasts a massive circular garden suitable to hold large parties, overlooking the Sydney Harbour . It's no wonder it has a $20 million price tag with a colonnaded entrance foyer and a grand cedar staircase . Retaining its colonial roots with its 4m high ceilings, a modern edge is added with a kitchen with marble counter tops and industrial kitchen facilities . This is married with a kitchen that could satisfy any keen cook's needs. The house's massive breakfast room leads into an open-plan commercial kitchen which includes a marble island, stainless steel benchtops, a gas stove and double even, a teppanyaki grill and three sinks. Large dinner parties will be no trouble with a sizable entertainment garden and a banquet-sized dining room with a balcony and butler's pantry. Each bedroom is decked out with luxurious marble ensuite bathrooms with heated floors and walk-in wardrobes. The home's lavish style continues onto the last level with a basement workshop encased in sandstone walls and extensive cellars. Jenner House has panoramic views of Sydney Harbour as well as 10 marble fireplaces and kauri timber floors . Five of the property's bedrooms are decked out with marble ensuite bathrooms . According to Australia's Department of Environment, Jenner House was initially built as a two-storey building as one of the late 19th century villas that lined Potts Point and was heritage-listed in 1991. The home's third-storey extensions were commissioned by Mr Nealk and done by well-known architect Thomas Rowe between 1875-1877. Jenner House is being sold through Jason Boon of Richardson & Wrench, Michael Pallier of Sydney Sotheby's International Realty, and Barry Goldman and Robert Page of Raine & Horne Double Bay. A circular driveway greet guests as they enter the property with six spots for cars to park . Cast-iron columns and lacy balconies decorate the outside of the house to maximise the benefits of the view .

"By . Freya Noble . Nei Lima Da Costa has pleaded guilty to seven charges following a horror crash which saw three people lose their lives . A Melbourne woman watched in horror as her husband was knocked 50 metres by a drug-affected, speeding driver as the couple walked home from their anniversary dinner. Nei Lima Da Costa was speeding at about 120km/h when he fatally hit Anthony Parsons as he crossed a Melbourne intersection, before colliding with a car and also killing married couple Savvas and Ismini Menelaou. Lima Da Costa, 30, has pleaded guilty to seven charges including culpable driving causing death, negligently causing serious injury and reckless conduct endangering life.' Mr Parsons' widow, Sue Parsons, said Lima Da Costa's crime had taken her 'soul mate, confidant and best friend'. She was just metres behind her 45-year-old husband when he was struck as they walked home after a night out celebrating their 10th wedding anniversary on January 12. 'I cannot describe what it was like to see my husband killed before my eyes,' she said in a victim statement read to the Victorian Supreme Court on Tuesday. The force of the collision broke every bone in Mr Parsons' body, severed his arm and threw him 52 metres. Lima Da Costa, a Brazilian citizen, walked from the wreckage of his car with just a broken collarbone. Blood tests found he had the drug ice in his system. 'I was asking people: 'Where's my husband, where's my husband',' Mrs Parsons said. She described being in a state of shock by the time she found his battered body and desperately tried to rouse him. Savvas (left) and his wife Inima Menelaou (right) were killed during the accident, while their son who was driving was seriously injured, as were two other elderly passengers in the car . 'I kept tapping him on the arm to wake up,' she said. 'I kept saying 'C'mon honey, wake up and talk to me', but he wouldn't.' Prosecutor Andrew Tinney SC said Lima Da Costa was travelling 40km/h over the speed limit when he ran the red light, collecting Mr Parsons, before hitting a Ford sedan carrying Savvas Menelaou, 67, and his wife Ismini Menelaou, 59, who both died at the scene. Their son Menelaos Menelaou was driving the sedan and suffered life-threatening injuries. Another elderly couple who were passengers in the sedan also suffered serious injuries. Mr Tinney said witnesses described seeing a 'white blur' as Lima Da Costa's car weaved in and out of traffic and ran red lights on his way from Crown casino in Melbourne's CBD to the collision site in Oakleigh. His plea hearing continues. Lima Da Costa reportedly ran red lights on his way from the Crown Casino before the crash in Oakleigh .

"By . Sarah Dean . A retail chain has been slammed by shoppers for allegedly 'promoting bullying' after splashing the slogan 'You can't sit with us' across a range of products aimed at young people. A children's charity has also condemned the quote, which they say is classed as 'covert bullying'. Australian fashion chain Cotton On has removed t-shirts and accessories, branded with the line from the 2004 film Mean Girls, from its shops after shoppers expressed their outrage. Jess Bridson, from Gisborne, a city in northeastern New Zealand, first spotted a black clutch bag in her local store featuring the offensive quote. Offensive: One shopper was outraged when she spotted this bag in a Cotton On store in New Zealand . Writing on Facebook on Saturday, she said: 'Way to promote bullying Cotton On! This is really s***, why can't it say ""would you like to hang with us?"".' The image was quickly shared online by people who were outraged that the bag was being sold in a shop aimed at the teen market. Sandie Farr wrote: 'Promoting bullying to the demographic that suffers most from it - massive fail Cotton On.' 'Not cool at all Cotton On - bullying is NEVER fashionable,' Tina Ngata said. Angry: A woman accuses the store of promoting bullying, in a Facebook comment on the picture of the black bag . 'Not cool': A woman comments on Facebook over the products which are aimed at the youth fashion market . 'Retail fail': A woman explains that 'we have enough trouble with bullying' already . Ema Vincent Logan added: 'Way to promote bullying guys... 'I don't really care what movie it came from it's disgusting and I had heard it far too many times as a kid and growing up.' Liz Tibbutt also said it was irrelevant whether the line 'You can't sit with us' came from a film. 'Really, Cotton On? I know it's a quote from Mean Girls and I know it is meant to be cute but don't we have enough trouble with bullying?' In the film, starring Lindsay Lohan and Amanda Seyfried, one of the Mean Girls, Gretchen, shouts 'you can't sit with us' at Regina because she is wearing sweatpants on a Monday - it's against the rules to wear them on that day of the week. Regina replies: 'These sweatpants are all that fits me right now.' Not the only one: Other popular fashion retailers also stock products with the Mean Girls slogan on them. This vest top is on sale at online retailer Misguided . 'A statement like ""you can't sit with us"" is a form of exclusion which we categories as covert bullying,' a representative for children's charity The Alannah and Madeline Foundation, Katina Astles, told Daily Mail Australia. 'Being left out can affect all aspects of young people's lives... including their academic performance.' She explained that bullying is a serious issue in Australia. 'Our research shows 1 in 4 kids in Australian schools experience bullying every fortnight. It can happen on the way to school, during class activities and in the playground.' 'I think it's really good Cotton On have listened to the feedback from the community and recognised the impact the products could have and taken action,' Ms Astles added. Cotton On Group spokeswoman Greer McCracken told the New Zealand Herald that the products have been 'voluntarily with drawn from sale, pending a formal investigation'. She added: 'This is a business underpinned by a sound moral and ethical code. The Cotton On Group does not condone bullying on any level and takes matters such as this very seriously.' Cotton On are not the only company who have used the the 'mean' line on its products. Online fashion retailer Misguided, which operates in Australia, the UK and the US, is currently stocking a black and white 'You can't sit with us' vest. Popular: Lots of online retailers sell the slogan on tops in the US. This one can be purchased from Me and My Tee for $21.93 AU . Baby version: A Mean Girls 'you can't sit with us' pink high chair organic baby bodysuit is available to buy from US online shop Spunky Stork . The top can be bought for $19.98 AU and the product description reads: 'Make a mean girl statement in our ""You can't sit with us"" boyfriend vest. In white with a monochrome ribbed trim, this slouchy style looks amazing with sports luxe leggings and black heeled sandals.' Plenty more online retailers have also borrowed the quote to be used on tops, hats and sweaters around the world. In the US, Fairtrade retailer Spunky Stork, sells white baby bodysuits with the slogan written in pink and accompanied by a picture of a high-chair. The Daily Mail Australia has contacted Cotton On and Misguided for comment.","Australian fashion chain Cotton On has removed t-shirts and accessories branded with the line from Mean Girls from its stores .

"By . Louise Cheer . Teenage staff at a Melbourne restaurant weren't making any dough but instead were being paid in pizza by their employer. Restauranteur Ruby Chand was fined $334,818 for underpaying 111 workers at two of his La Porchetta restaurants. Instead Chand offered them discounted pizza and soft drink. The workers were underpaid a total of $258,000. Many of his workers were teenagers with one as young as 13 years old and were employed on a part-time of casual basis between 2009 and 2012. Employees at two La Porchetta restaurants in Pakenham and Berwick were paid in discounted pizza and soft drinks . Chand was ordered by Judge John O'Sullivan to hand over the fines in a Federal Circuit Court ruling on June 6, the Fair Work Ombudsman said on Tuesday. Judge O'Sullivan said the practice of offering workers discounted food and drink instead of pay belonged 'in the dark ages'. 'Ensuring compliance with minimum standards is an important consideration in this case,' he said. Chand was ordered to pay a personal fine of $55,803, while his companies operating the restaurants - Bound for Glory Enterprises Pty Ltd and Zillion Zenith International Pty Ltd - were each fined $139,507.50 a piece. The two companies were also required to back-pay workers who had money owed to them, with more than $79,000 still outstanding. Judge O'Sullivan said the crackdown was to serve as a deterrent for Chand and his companies from possible future breaches. Ruby Chand, from Tecoma in Melbourne, was fined a total of $334,000 for underpaying staff - some as young as 13 . The two restaurants were operated by Bound for Glory Enterprises Pty Ltd and Zillion Zenith International Pty Ltd who were fined $139,507.50 each . 'The contraventions themselves and the conduct of the respondents fundamentally hamstrung the ability to confirm the affected employees’ entitlements during the investigation, the co-operation was less than forthcoming,' he said. 'In that sense I am not convinced the respondents are genuinely remorseful.' Chand has previously been required to back-pay other employees who were underpaid in 2007, 2008 and 2009 and was warned by Fair Work inspectors that he needed to pay employees what they were due. The La Porchetta franchises were investigated after receiving a complaint from a parent of a young staff member. It was discovered almost 60 employees at the Pakenham branch had been underpaid by $130,195 and more than 50 employees at Berwick had been short-changed $127,824. The court heard Chand was giving half-priced pizzas and soft drinks to employees to 'offset' the cost of their wages. Underpayments to individual employees ranged from as little as $3 up to $25,358 . Employees were also being paid below the minimum wage they were entitled to, and apprentices and trainees were also found to be in a similar situation. Underpayments to individual employees ranged from as little as $3 up to $25,358. Part-time and casual employees were taken on as cooks, kitchen attendants, food and beverage service employees as well as part of training programs, allowing Chand's companies access to more than $45,000 worth of Commonwealth benefits.","More than 100 employees were found to be underpaid by Ruby Chand .

"By . Lillian Radulova . The man, who was caught on camera charging at an enormous stingray on the Gold Coast, has baffled marine biologists and diving experts by declaring that the shadow was a fake. Contacting the Gold Coast Bulletin via email, the man claimed that his daughter was flying a stingray shaped kite while he took a swim near Sea World in Queensland. After noticing the realistic shadow, he said the duo shared a laugh and decided to send the footage to a few friends as part of a practical joke. Scroll down for video . Stingray or the shadow of a kite? The man who was seen leaping at a stingray on the Gold Coast has claimed the figure was just a shadow from his daughters kite . The man was seen diving at the 'stingray' said the footage was part of a practical joke that they forwarded to friends . The footage showed him diving aggressively at the alleged kite, which swam away from his charges. Soon afterwards, the figure appears to charge at the man who looks to be diving away in fright. The next thing he knew, his mates had uploaded the footage onto Youtube where it went viral before being picked up by Nine News. Clearly somewhat concerned about the amount of negative attention the video sparked from animal cruelty activists, the man decided to attempt to set the record straight. He also provided the publication with the entire footage from the 'hoax' which shows him casually walking over the figure, which can be viewed on their website. 'No kites were harmed in the making of the video,' he told the Bulletin, opting to remain anonymous and refusing to be interviewed for a story. He contacted the Gold Coast Bulletin via email with the information, even sending them the full version of the footage where he can be seen walking over the figure . 'No kites were harmed in the making of the video,' he told the Bulletin, opting to remain anonymous and refusing to be interviewed for a story . As the 'stingray' accelerates toward the man, he dives away from the creature and seems to get away unharmed . He also stressed that he had a great respect for the 'majestic' sea creatures and would never intentionally harm them. Despite the supposed hoax, Gavin Ball, 27, a Southport local who works at a café near where the animal encounter took place said that stingrays are common in the area. 'If you're out on the pier you see them every day,' he told MailOnline. The most common stingrays are a smaller variety – 45 to 50 cm – but he says the larger estuary rays are still around, but that someone would have to be an 'idiot' to deliberately provoke them. Stingrays are very common at Broadwater on the Gold Coast, and are generally not territorial or aggressive .","The man was seen swimming alongside the figure on the Gold Coast .

"By . Louise Cheer . and Aap . Indonesian tourism operators will push Australians to holiday in places other than Bali after fears the party island is being overrun by tourists. A Balinese travel fair taking place this week will encourage visitors to explore outside of the usual hotspots of Kuta and Seminyak beaches. But one expert said authorities need to go further and designate Bali as a transit from which tourists would be expected to move on. Tourism operators are trying to steer more people out of Bali to prevent the party island from being overrun . Nyoman Sukma Arida, of Udayana University, has been warning for 10 years that Bali tourism is approaching saturation, pointing to signs of environmental stress all over the island. A moratorium on new hotel developments was ineffective, he says, and the government should urgently discuss how to save Bali from its own success. 'I've written that Bali should be used as a hub, as the distributor of tourists all over Indonesia,' Professor Nyoman told AAP. 'When I went to Perth recently, I saw that people there still see Bali as their only option. 'It's just that their knowledge of other places in Indonesia is very limited.' I Ketut Ardana of the Association of Indonesian Tour and Travel Agencies disagrees the sector is growing unsustainably. 'I don't agree with using Bali only as a hub, but I agree that other tourist destinations in Indonesia should be selling in Bali,' he said. Australian tourists would be prime candidates to visit other destinations in Indonesia, he says, because their average length of stay in Bali is 10 to 14 days, compared to four to five days for Asian tourists and seven days for European tourists. Nyoman Sukma Arida, from Indonesia's Udayana University, has been warning of tourist overpopulation of Bali for 10 years . These concerns come as documentary series What Happens in Bali, airs on Australian television, capturing all of the antics experienced by intrepid tourists of the party island. One Aussie larrikin on the show that has sparked outrage amongst viewers is former Newcastle rugby player Todd Gisondi who is a self-confessed sex addict. He claims to have had sex with 100 women since moving to Bali four months ago and has turned his sexual prowess into a job, becoming a gigolo following advice from his own mother. Mr Nyoman's comments come as What Happens in Bali airs on Australian television featuring Todd Gisondi .

"By . Kate Lyons . President Obama has praised Australia's gun laws, saying that the U.S.'s high rate of mass shooting 'makes no sense'. Speaking at a Q&A at the White House, just hours after a shooting at an Oregon high school that claimed the life of one student, the president said that his 'biggest frustration' about his time in office is that he has not been able to make more progress with tightening gun laws. He commended the changes to gun laws introduced in Australia in 1996 after the Port Arthur massacre, which claimed the lives of 35 people. President Obama addressed gun violence during a Q&A at the White House hosted by Tumblr . 'A couple of decades ago, Australia had a mass shooting, similar to Columbine or Newtown, and Australia just said “Well that's it, we're not seeing that again.” And basically imposed very severe, tough gun laws and they haven't had a mass shooting since,' said President Obama. 'Now we have a different tradition, we have a second amendment, we have historically respected gun rights, I respect gun rights, but the fact that we couldn't even get a background check in… it makes no sense. 'Our levels of gun violence are off the charts, there's no advanced, developed country on earth that would put up with this,' he said. President Obama was responding to a question sent in by Nick Dineen, who attends the University of California, Santa Barbara and knew one of the six victims killed in the shooting there last month. The president said he had been greatly frustrated by the influence of the NRA over Congress and things would not change until there was a 'fundamental shift in public opinion'. 'The country has to do some soul-searching about this,' he said. President Obama was speaking in response to a question from a student at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who knew one of the victims of the recent shooting there . 'There's no advanced, developed country on earth that would put up with this': Obama praised Australia's gun laws, introduced after the Port Arthur massacre in 1996 . The most recent U.S. school shooting occurred at Reynolds High School in Troutdale, Oregon at 8am on Tuesday local time. One student was killed and a teacher was injured, and it is believed the shooter died from a self-inflicted wound. Australia introduced a gun buy-back scheme in October 1996, in response to public outrage at the Port Arthur massacre, when Martin Bryant, a disturbed 28-year-old man, killed 35 people and wounded 23 more with guns he said he purchased from a dealer without the required gun license. The scheme concluded in September 1997, during that year the buyback scheme resulted in the purchase and destruction of more than 630,000 guns. Gun-related homicides dropped by 27 percent from 1996 when the buy-back scheme was implemented to 2010. Suicides involving firearms also dropped significantly. The U.S. has the highest rate of gun-related death of any developed country in the world, with 10 deaths per 100,000 people, whereas Australia has one death per 100,000 people, according to research from Gunpolicy.org.

"By . Sarah Chalmers . There's a picture buried in my family photo album that makes me recoil in horror. It shows a dowdy woman squinting uncertainly at the camera, her matronly Laura Ashley floral dress and frizzy perm clearly doing nothing for either her figure or her self-confidence. But this picture isn’t of an elderly aunt or frumpy family friend — it’s me, at a 21st birthday party in 1990. Yes, at a time when I should have been looking my most youthful  and radiant, I was more middle-aged than I am now — lamb dressed as mutton, if you will — and sadly I remained that way for the next 20 years. Lamb dressed as mutton: On her 21st birthday Sarah looked more middle-aged than she does now . It’s only now, aged 45, that I am finally at ease with how I look. In fact, I’m regularly mistaken for a younger woman, thanks to a wardrobe stuffed with skinny jeans and fitted jackets from fashion-forward stores such as Cos, Whistles and teenager’s favourite H&M. I even have a trendy gamine haircut. In many ways, it seems, I’ve actually aged backwards. And I’m not alone: something dramatic has happened to older women like me who, according to  a recent survey of 2,000 adults,  commissioned by healthcare provider Benenden Health, believe middle age begins at 53. Armed with a disposable income and constantly bombarded with images of eternally youthful  stars such as Amanda Holden  (muttony at 20, foxy at 40) we’ve gritted our teeth and made the best of ourselves. Perhaps it’s the sudden shock of the first wrinkle or, conversely, the growing confidence to take risks that sees so many of us deciding to defer growing old: a last-ditch attempt to recapture the youth that’s slowly slipping out of our grasp. Ageing in reverse: Aged 45 Sarah is finally at ease with how she looks, and feels younger than ever . The once-frumpy, now never-badly dressed Emma Thompson seemed to have a style revelation at a similar age. When she finally left behind the cropped hair and combat pants she was once known for, and started turning up to red carpet events in slinky Maria Grachvogel in 2004, she explained her transformation: ‘I will be 45 years old this year and I don’t have many more years left to be glamorous.’ Buying online and easy returns have also eroded the middle-aged woman’s bugbear of communal changing rooms, with their unforgiving, unflatteringly lit mirrors. No wonder recent figures showed 86 per cent of women aged 45 to 54 had made at least one online fashion purchase in the past six months, and more of us than ever are shopping in trendy ‘youth’ stores such as H&M and New Look. Revelation: Actress Emma Thompson has left behind her days of cropped hair and combat pants . Compare that with my 20s, when my achingly earnest generation of women were so desperate to be taken seriously that we saw fashion as frivolous and deemed not making an effort to be ‘cool’. And since the generation before us — who had been born in the post-war Forties — had barely experienced teenage years, far less the middle youth that now keeps adults in semi-adolescence until they are almost 50, no precedent had been set for anything other than sensible dressing from  21 onwards. My mum, Ruth, was typical. A radiographer from Fife who stopped working when my older sister, Debbi, and I were born in her early 20s, she had a pathological fear of looking like mutton dressed as lamb. She refused to wear ‘denim jeans’ after the age of 30 for the same reason, and I absorbed her values. So it’s no surprise that I have another picture of me, a year after leaving Edinburgh University, in my first job as a reporter, wearing a russet trouser suit from Austin Reed that completely drowns my 25-year-old figure and looks at least two sizes too big. My day-to-day working wardrobe was usually bought at middle-aged favourites such as C&A, M&S or, if I was pushing the boat out, Principles and Laura Ashley. My casual style was no better: it consisted of baggy sweatshirts and shapeless jeans and my make-up regime was nothing but mascara and lipstick. No wonder I once suffered the indignity of having a taxi driver mistake me for my friend’s mother, accompanying her to a university open day. And it’s just as well I was focused on my studies as I doubt I was turning many heads. Somehow, in my mid-30s, I finally found a man willing to look past my shoulder pads and knee-length skirts. My husband, Jem, a children’s author, 45, professes, typically, that he didn’t notice what I was wearing unless it was short. Getting shirty: A wardrobe stuffed with skinny jeans and fitted shirts and jackets has seen Sarah go from frumpy to foxy . Shopping for a wedding dress took me inside high-end designer shops and department stores for the first time, but these sartorial stirrings were put on hold again between the ages of 35 and 39, when I was either pregnant with my son, Freddie, now eight, and my twins, Bobby and Loulou, six, or in a sleep-deprived fog. But then, suddenly, everything changed. My eldest started school and the younger two began sleeping through the night. I remember standing in front of the mirror, in cords and a sweatshirt, meeting my reflection’s eyes and realising that I’d spent my entire life on my career and nurturing others. Two billion T-shirts are sold around the world each year . I suddenly wanted to be frivolous for the first time. I was 42 by the time my twins started school and, faced with 20-something mums in the playground, I was determined never to be mistaken for their granny. Slowly, I weaned myself off Peacocks clothes, got my hair cut and dyed, and dared to reveal a figure honed by  years of pushing a double buggy. I still remember the outfit that really ignited my passion for fashion, which I bought in upmarket Islington, in London: a leopard-print wrap dress from Hobbs, a fur-collared camel coat from Jigsaw and a pair of nude heels from Kurt Geiger. When I walked down the street, I felt more youthful and sexy than I ever did in my 20s and I think I may even have detected a  wolf whistle. Suddenly, I had time to read fashion magazines and tear my eyes away from my children long enough to notice what was in shop windows. I . ask myself if Sally Bercow  would wear any item I pick up, and if the answer is yes, I . put it back on the rack . I learnt that you can never have too many coats or shoes as the first impression you give is usually outdoors, and to update classic outfits every season with on-trend accessories. After a few years, it finally dawned on me that you can’t buy cheap in your 40s and are better served for basics in higher-end High Street stores such as LK Bennett and Hobbs, and that a new level of grooming is essential so as not to look old and unkempt. I even devised the ‘Sally Bercow rule’ — never mind Amanda Holden, who revealed last week that whenever she has a style dilemma, she wonders: ‘What would Jennifer Aniston do?’ I ask myself if Sally Bercow [Speaker’s wife and former Big Brother contestant] would wear any item I pick up, and if the answer is yes, I put it back on the rack. All that said, I do feel wistful when I look at my children and realise that, thanks to fast, disposable fashion and the ever-increasing pressure to conform — now constantly policed by social media — the carefree days when image didn’t matter are over. After all, how can you make fashion mistakes and truly learn your own style if you don’t get it wrong from time to time? Even if it is in a flowery Laura Ashley frock.","Aged 21, Sarah dressed more middle-aged than she does now at 45 .

"By . Kate Lyons . An 18-year-old girl suffering an ultra-rare and life-threatening condition requires treatment with the 'world's most expensive drug' to survive - at the staggering cost of $24,000 per fortnight, none of which is subsidised by Medicare or the Australian Government. Gold Coast teen Bianca Scott is one of just 70 Australians who suffer from the rare genetic disease atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). Caused by a problem in the immune system, it can result in blood clots that can destroy internal organs. The illness is both debilitating and deadly, and Miss Scott requires frequent hospital visits where she receives the drug Soliris, which effectively stalls the disease and can even repair chronic kidney damage. The treatment costs Ms Scott's mother Tammy Hamawi $24,000 per fortnightly dose. Scroll down for video . Bianca Scott was diagnosed with a rare condition called aHUS when she was seven months old, it reappeared late last year . Since her diagnosis, Bianca has spent most of her time in hospital in Brisbane, where she undergoes dialysis and plasma transfusions . Ms Hamawi has given up her job running her own mentoring and business consultancy company to care for her daughter, and all of her money, as well as money from her family, friends, even Bianca's school has gone into providing the life-saving treatment, a drug named Soliris. 'Without a doubt Soliris is the most expensive drug in the world,' said Ms Hamawi. 'It is the only treatment in the whole world for aHUS.' Bianca was diagnosed with aHUS, which can strike at any age, when she was seven months old. She then found out then that her uncle had died of the disease as a child. Unusually, the illness lay dormant in Bianca before resurfacing late last year, just a few weeks after she finished high school. Bianca's mother Tammy Hamawi (left) discovered a drug that could treat aHUS, called Soliris, which costs $24,000 per fortnightly dose . Bianca was first diagnosed with the life-threatening illness when she was seven months old (pictured here after her initial diagnosis) So far Ms Hamawi has been able to pay for five courses of the treatment, with help from her family and from donations . Soliris is currently available at a subsidised rate for people suffering with another ultra-rare disease, called paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) through the Life Saving Drugs Program (LSDP). It was being considered by the LSDP as a treatment for aHUS when the LSDP was put under review by the federal government earlier this year. The drug was then moved for consideration to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC). The PBAC recommended that Soliris be subsidised under the Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme for sufferers of aHUS, though there are still several bureaucratic steps to go through before any subsidy will come into effect. Kirsten Bruce, a representative of the aHUS Patient Support Group Australia said that the PBAC recommendation leaves many questions unanswered. Of particular concern, she says, is that under the proposed conditions, patients will only be eligible for the drug is they are currently experiencing a flare-up of the condition, and will only be allowed to take the drug for six months after they have recovered from the attack, even though it is recommended that sufferers remain on the drug for the duration of their lives. 'Sufferers want to know who will qualify for Soliris, whether they'll be able to stay on it long-term, there are so many question marks,' she said. 'The tragedy is there's a drug that's available, that works, and it sits on pharmacy shelves, the doctors want to be able to prescribe it but they can't.' A spokesperson for the Federal Department of Health confirmed that it was currently in negotiations with Alexion, who hold the patent for the drug. Alexion were contacted for comment. 'Mum noticed symptoms and she took me to hospital and they told me the aHUS had come back. Since then I was faced with this terrible battle,' she said. 'I couldn't keep any food down, I was always vomiting, I couldn't stand up, I'd feel very dizzy, I had fevers… sadly I have chronic kidney failure now.' She required an endless run of hospital visits – with Bianca requiring eight-hour stretches of dialysis three to four days a week, as well as plasma infusions – before Ms Hamawi heard of Soliris. 'Thank God for Google!' she said. Ms Hamawi was able to fund five doses of the drug, with the help of her family and friends, and two further doses were bought using donations, including a $19,000 donation from Bianca's school and an anonymous $10,000 donation. 'I am so grateful for that,' said Bianca. 'I thank everyone for that.' Since starting on Soliris on Valentine's Day, Bianca has turned a corner. She still requires dialysis, but the plasma infusions, which she describes as 'weird' and 'scary' have stopped, her hours in hospital have significantly decreased and she is feeling much better. Her blood tests are also showing vastly improved results, with the nephrologist telling Bianca on Monday that if her results continue in the direction they're going she might be able to come off dialysis. But with the cost of Soliris currently so high, it was cost $680,000 a year to keep her on the drug, Bianca and her mother do not have the money to buy their next dose, which Bianca is due to take on Thursday June 19. Without Soliris, Bianca will likely deteriorate, and if left too long, the damage to her kidney will be so severe that she will have to remain on dialysis for the rest of her life. 'She's 17, can you imagine a lifetime of chronic kidney failure? And when I say a lifetime, it's not going to be a long life,' said Ms Hamawi. Ms Hamawi is frustrated at Alexion, the U.S. company that produce Soliris and own the patent for the drug. 'On the one hand $680,000 a year to save your child's life is a big price, it's too high,' she said. However, most of her anger is directed at the Australian government, which she says is 'a system that we thought was there to protect and look after us [and] has in a way let us down'. 'It baffles me how could you justify fuelling aeroplanes to go and look for an aeroplane that’s who knows where. But when someone needs mediciine, and it is the only medicine that is available, you sit there and negotiate and it might take six months,' she said.

"By . Lillian Radulova . Hillary Clinton has condemned the disgraceful sexism directed at former prime minister Julia Gillard during her role as Australia’s leader. Mrs Clinton, who plans to run for president in the United States, made reference to Ms Gillard in her new memoir Hard Choices, which described her experience as the US secretary of state. 'Women in public life still face an unfair double standard,' Mrs Clinton wrote in her book which was released on Tuesday. Scroll down for video . Hillary Clinton has condemned the outrageous sexism faced by former Australian prime minister Julia Gillard in her memoir which was released on Tuesday . 'Even leaders like former prime minister Julia Gillard of Australia have faced outrageous sexism which shouldn't be tolerated in any country.' Both women have faced their fair share of sexism throughout their political careers with Ms Gillard's famous sexism speech in 2012, directed at the current prime minister Tony Abbott, still ringing in the ears of women across the world. Mrs Clinton and Ms Gillard first met in the same year of the speech, at a meeting in Perth. In an interview with Anne Summers, Ms Gillard recalled her meeting with the US senator who had offered her some useful advice. 'We did have a discussion about where our media cycle was stuck then, which was this relentless opposition questioning about events the best part of 20 years ago,' Ms Gillard said to Summers, in reference to the scandal that arose about her time as a lawyer at Slater and Gordon. Ms Gillard and Mrs Clinton met for the first time in 2012 at a Perth meeting, where the US senator shared some advice with the then Australian prime minister . Hard Choices reflects on Ms Clinton's experiences in the White House, by the sides of both Barack Obama and her husband . The advice she gave the then prime minister was: 'You've got to stand up to it and be clear about it and name it for what it is because the temptation is to say, ""Look this is so absurd, it'll die a death"", whereas these things unfortunately don't die a death,' Ms Gilard recalled. Clinton’s memoir was released with great gusto across the US with book events and vast media coverage. The interview connected to the book's release highlighted some of the hurdles she could face if she seeks the White House again: her record as President Barack Obama's top diplomat, the turbulence of her husband's presidency and charges by Republicans that she has been insulated from the everyday problems of Americans after more than two decades in public life.","Mrs Clinton condemned the sexism Ms Gillard faced during her time as PM .

"By . Darren Boyle . Mark Mellard, pictured, put the bottle containing sulphuric acid into his pocket when he was going to clean a drain, unfortunately the plastic container melted causing serious burns . A workman suffered severe burns after his leg was soaked in sulphuric acid - which burned through an Irn-Bru bottle. Mark Mellard, 46, needed two skin grafts after putting the drinks bottle into his pocket unaware that colleague John Campey had filled it with the highly-corrosive liquid. A court heard how his colleague decanted the heavy-duty drain cleaner from its container and left it next to a sink at the DHL Debenhams warehouse at Sherburn Industrial Estate in Selby, North Yorkshire. Both Mr Mellard and his colleague believed the substance in the bottle to be a less corrosive drain cleaner. After feeling his leg burning, Mr Mellard removed it and threw it away, before rushing to the toilets where he put cold water on his leg. The pain stopped as his nerve endings were damaged, so Mr Mellard went home and walked the dog before going to hospital on June 20 last year. He was kept in hospital for ten days and even had to spend two hours in a special decontamination unit. Mr Mellard believes he was sacked as a result of the accident. He said he tried to return to work three times but each time he was told he was suspended without pay, before finally losing his job. He said: 'I’ve been out of work since and it’s going to take two to four years for it to fully heal.' Campey, from Castleford, West Yorkshire, and Mr Mellard have since lost their jobs at the warehouse. Campey, who was a representative of the company’s Health and Safety committee and had undergone Care Of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) training, denied giving the acid to Mr Mellard, but said it had been left unattended. He admitted two counts of breaching Health and Safety regulations. Mark Monaghan, defending, said the sulphuric acid had only been in use at the facility for a week, replacing a weaker drain cleaner which had been previously used. Mr Monaghan said: 'He put it into what he accepts now was not an appropriate container with the intention of going to clean the drain. 'He had certainly not realised that the new chemical which had been used from the week was considerably stronger and more caustic than the previous drain cleaner. Mr Mellard suffered extensive burns, pictured, following the accident and has needed two skin grafts. According to medics it may take two years for the injuries to heal . 'Although this is an offence that led to quite a bad injury, it is a case where the difficulty arose because of unfortunate error of judgement not through deliberate effort. 'In effect, he had to find a smaller container than the new large one that had been used from that week to find some chemical to apply to a blocked drain.' Mr Mellard said he was also in the process of taking the company to an industrial tribunal, and although he and Campey used to be friends, they had not contacted each other since the incident last year. Magistrates ordered Campey to carry out 60 hours unpaid work in the community and to pay £300 towards prosecution costs, and a £60 victim surcharge. The court heard a civil action was also underway, over the matter of compensation for the injured man. Tim Grogan, senior enforcement officer at Selby District Council, said: 'This case demonstrates that Selby District Council will prosecute where health and safety regulations have been breached, and particularly when serious injuries are the consequences. 'The magistrates recognised the gravity of the matter and I am satisfied with their findings.' Mr Mellard's colleague John Campey filled the Irn-Bru bottle, pictured, with sulphuric acid. The company had previously used a less caustic drain cleaner that did not melt plastic bottles . Speaking after the case, Mr Mellard said: 'They sacked me for attempted theft of chemicals but I never stole anything. I was given it. 'I asked my colleague what he was doing and he said he was clearing a drain. I had a blocked drain at home so I asked him if I could have some of the drain cleaner he was using. Mr Mellard said he has been scarred for life, pictured, after the accident and is currently in the process of taking a civil case against his former employers . 'He gave me a bottle but I didn't know . what the substance was inside. He left it on the side for me. I was . leaving work so I put the bottle in my pocket with my keys. As I was . walking out of the warehouse, the bottle burst.' He said he tried to clean the acid from his leg with water before going home. 'I . had no idea what it was so I didn't think it would be that bad. If I'd . have known, I wouldn't have put my trousers back on but I did, which . must have made it worse. 'I drove home wearing the trousers that were covered in acid and then washed them out.' When he arrived in hospital, doctors asked him what what had caused the injuries and they transferred him to a decontamination unit for two hours before moving him to the burns unit. 'A couple of days later I had the first skin graft. They gave me a spinal anaesthetic so I actually watched the whole thing. I was sent home ten days later but I had to keep going back to have the dressings changed.' Mr Mellard said: 'I tried going back to work about four weeks after it happened because I wasn't getting sick pay so I needed the money. As soon as I walked through the door, I was suspended. I tried to go back another three times but each time, I was suspended again until I was sacked. 'They also said I had breached the handling of chemicals but I was never trained in that any way so I couldn't have breached it.' Mr Mellard said he hasn't seen his colleague since the accident but does not blame him for his misfortune. He added: ""John and I always used to talk. We got on, and we'd chat about the rugby. 'When it happened, John was by my side but he just left me to it and I went to the toilet to try and wash it off. 'I don't blame John. I don't believe he was trained properly.' Mr Mellard's colleague transferred some of the sulphuric acid from the container, pictured to a small 500ml Irn-Bru bottle so he could take some of the liquid home to clean his own drains .","Mark Mellard needed two skin grafts after the acid badly burned his leg .

The adverts look like Instagram pictures posted by friends, but have 'Sponsored' written in the top right-hand corner. Adverts can be hidden from a feed by clicking the 'More' button, which consists of three small circles. Users can give feedback to companies about they liked or disliked a particular advert. The first brands to sign up to the scheme were Adidas, Ben and Jerry's, Burberry, General Electric, Lexus, Levi's, Macy's, Michael Kors, PayPal and Starwood. The company said that advertisers has seen positive results ‘well above the ad industry’s average for performance’. Instagram was acquired by Facebook in 2012 for $1bn and has over 200million users across the globe. The company said that it is ‘methodical and deliberate’ about choosing which brands pop up in users’ feeds. There are strict rules that advertisers have to adhere to, such as no text to accompany images and no product shots. Instead, images should capture ‘moments’. In short, the adverts are designed to look like they are posted by your friends. Adverts being rolled out in the new regions are expected to follow the same format as those shown in the U.S. And, if their introduction also follows suit, global Instagram users will initially rubbish the decision to introduce adverts, before accepting and even liking them, as seen with their U.S. counterparts.

"By . Emma Innes . A toddler has a rare condition that makes his skin so dry he can't blink. Daniel Maples, who is 18 months-old, was born with lamellar ichthyosis - which affects just one in 600,000 people - and causes the skin to become thickened and cracked. The top layer of his skin sheds six times faster than normal - leaving a thick, scale-like build-up of skin underneath. Daniel Maples, 18 months old, has a rare, genetic condition which causes his skin to thicken and crack . The top layer of Daniel's skin sheds six times faster than normal - leaving a thick, scale-like build-up . His parents Steve Maples, 29 and Emma Holby, 23, have to smother him in medical jelly like Vaseline every four hours to stop his delicate skin from cracking. Mr Maples, a recruiter from Maldon, Essex, said: ‘The skin is thick and it peels off and it takes about two months to completely come off. ‘Over time he now has to be creamed every four to six hours each day and every three hours throughout the night. ‘It’s a very high maintenance condition and he also requires two or three showers a day as well as eye drops because he doesn’t blink. ‘He’s been in and out of hospital with skin infections because of the condition. ‘It will continue throughout his life and there’s no cure for it. When he is older he’ll have to do it all himself.’ Daniel's parents have to apply cream to his skin every four hours during the day and every three hours throughout the night. He is pictured with his mother, Emma Holby . There is no cure for Daniel's condition so as he gets older he will have to learn to manage it himself. He is pictured with his father, Steve Maples . He added: ‘Emma and I were just unlucky that we both had the gene. There is a one in four chance any children we have will get it. ‘As long as he’s been brought up right and it’s not an issue he will be alright. ‘It’s one of those things, he’s just a bit different. He’s a very happy child and as long as we teach him to be confident about himself I don’t see why he can’t lead a normal life.’ Lamellar ichthyosis, which develops when a child inherits an abnormal gene from both parents, speeds up the skin cell turnover. The word ichthyosis comes from the ancient Greek word for fish - because the cracked skin is said to resemble the scales on a fish. Daniel does not blink so he has to be given eye drops regularly so his eyes don't dry out . Throughout his life, Daniel has been in and out of hospital with skin infections. Image (right) shows him in hospital being treated with a Vaseline-like jelly . Problems associated with the condition include overheating, where a person’s thick skin prevents them from sweating, and eye problems caused by the tightness of the skin. Some children get ‘constriction bands’ which mean they have tight bands of skin around their fingers or toes which can prevent proper blood circulation. Severe scaling of the skin on the scalp can also lead to patchy loss of hair. Daniel’s parents are hoping to raise money for The Ichthyosis Support Group, and have so far raised £2,900 towards the fight for a cure. Anyone wishing to donate can do so by clicking here. Lamellar ichthyosis is a very rare skin condition characterised by abnormal scaling and shedding of the skin. It is believed to occur in one in every 600,000 people and symptoms usually appear within the first few days of life. Sufferers tend to have plate-like scales of skin which often appear brownish in colour. The condition is caused by genetic abnormalities that affect the shedding of skin. It occurs when both of a person's parents carry the abnormal gene - in this situation, there is a one in four chance of the person developing the condition. Lamellar ichthyosis can also cause overheating as it prevents sweating, and can constrict the blood flow to the fingers and toes as it causes the skin tighten. It can also cause eye problems, hair loss, and difficulty bending the hand joints. There is currently no cure and the key treatment is regularly applying moisturiser.","Daniel Maples has a condition which causes his skin to thicken and crack .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . If you’ve ever played with Lego, chances are you’ve attempted to build a freestanding tower of bricks. But while yours probably toppled only inches from the ground, a team of Lego constructors recently built a tower that reached a world record-breaking 114ft (34.76 metres). It was constructed in front of Saint Stephen's Basilica in Budapest and was topped off with a Lego version of a Rubik’s Cube. Scroll down for video . The 114ft (34.76 metre) tower (pictured) was built in front of Saint Stephen's Basilica in Budapest. It beat the previous world record of 112ft (34.34 metres) - set in Delaware last year. The completed tower consisted of 450,000 bricks . In December, members of the Tsukuba Lego Circle in Japan built a modern-day version of the 1980s game, Screwball Scramble. Called the Lego Great Ball Contraption, the mechanical device contained around 11,000 bricks. It was made up of modules submitted by various members of a Japanese Lego fan club. One of the largest stretches was built by 22-year-old Kawaguchi Akiyuki from Shimane. He built 17 of the modules using around 3,000 bricks. Pneumatic arms, robotic scoops and conveyor belts move the balls around. The team of builders, from the Lego Store Budapest, now hold the Guinness World Record for The Tallest Structure Built with Interlocking Plastic Bricks. Their tower beat the previous record of 112ft 11inches (34.43 metres) set by students in Delaware last August. The Budapest tower was made using 450,000 bricks and tapered towards the top to give it more stability. To claim the record, the tower was also freestanding, and not supported in anyway by structures or adhesive. Wires were used during the construction to stop the tower from toppling into a crowd that had gathered to watch, but once the final piece was put in place, the wires were removed. The team of builders, from the Lego Store Budapest, now hold the Guinness World Record for The Tallest Structure Built with Interlocking Plastic Bricks. The tower (base pictured) took four days to build and the record was verified at the weekend . The tower was topped off with a Lego version of a Rubik's Cube (pictured) The tower took four days to build and the record was verified at the weekend. The mayor of the city's 5th district said he hoped the record would promote Budapest to the world, before he was lifted on a crane to the top of the tower to place the last piece. ‘This is a modern obelisk behind us and it shows that with lots of minute engineering knowledge and diligence how we can call attention to the fact that this is one of the most beautiful squares of Budapest,' Mayor Antal Rogan said. 'I hope we will be able to achieve a new world record, and if it happens we will be able to draw even more tourists to [the region].

"By . Emma Innes . Heat makes ecstasy more lethal, new research suggests. U.S. researchers found doses of MDMA that would not be fatal in cool conditions, can kill people when taken in hot, crowded settings such as nightclubs. This is because the drug interferes with the body’s ability to regulate temperature. Even moderate doses of MDMA can be fatal in warm environments, such as nightclubs (file picture) Researchers at the National Institute of Health say some people believe MDMA is harmless when taken in moderate doses. But, their new research in rats showed this is not the case in hot environments. ‘We know that high doses of MDMA can sharply increase body temperature to potentially lead to organ failure or even death,’ said Dr Nora Volkow. ‘However, this current study opens the possibility that even moderate doses could be deadly in certain conditions.’ The researchers say it is currently impossible to predict who will have an adverse reaction to a low dose of MDMA. However in this study, scientists gave the rats low to moderate doses that have been shown in past studies to not be fatal. The drug interferes with the body's ability to regulate temperature so is dangerous in warm environments . They monitored the rats to determine drug-induced changes in brain and body temperature and in the body’s ability to cool itself through blood vessel dilation. When rats were alone and kept at room temperature, a moderate dose of MDMA modestly increased brain and body temperature and moderately diminished the rats’ ability to eliminate excessive heat. However, when researchers injected the same dose into rats that were either in a warmer environment or in the presence of another rat in the cage, brain temperature increased, causing death in some rats. ‘These results demonstrate that the use of MDMA in certain warm, social settings could be more dangerous than commonly believed,’ said Dr Eugene Kiyatkin, first author on the study. ‘Even with moderate doses, we saw drug-induced, fatal brain hyperthermia during conditions of social interaction and in warm environments.’","Doses of MDMA that are safe in cool places become dangerous in warm ones .

"By . Sophie Borland . A young doctor who is dying of cancer has described how patients are ‘dehumanised’ by NHS hospitals. Kate Granger said she had been left psychologically scarred after being told her cancer had spread by a junior doctor who did not even look her in the eye. The 32-year-old also said that consultants and other staff referred to patients within earshot by their types of illness or bed numbers. Before: Dr Granger, pictured above on her wedding day with her husband Chris in July 2005. She was later diagnosed with sarcoma, a bone and muscle cancer . Dr Granger was diagnosed with sarcoma, a rare form of cancer affecting the bones and muscles, three years ago when she was just 29. At first, it was hoped the tumour was confined to her abdomen and could be removed by surgery. But she was later told it had spread and is terminal. Describing the way the bad news  was broken to her, she said: ‘If you can put yourself in my position – I’m 29 years old, I know I’ve got cancer, I think it’s confined to my abdomen so I’m expecting to have an operation, maybe some chemotherapy and possibly a cure. 'Dehumanised': Dr Gtranger, pictured again with her husband, said doctors would routinely refer to her as 'bed 7' ‘I’m in a side room. I can hear everything that’s going on outside. I’m in pain and alone. ‘A junior doctor comes to see me to talk to me about the results of the MRI scan I’d had earlier in the week. I’d never met this doctor before. He came into my room, he sat down in the chair next to me and looked away from me. ‘Without any warning or asking if I wanted anyone with me he just said, “Your cancer has spread”. ‘He then could not leave the room quick enough and I was left in deep psychological distress. I never saw him again. I am a little bit psychologically scarred by that experience.’ Despite her illness, Dr Granger has continued to work as a registrar – a middle-grade doctor – specialising in elderly medicine at St James’s hospital, Leeds. She also gives speeches to medical professionals about improving care. Addressing managers at the NHS Confederation Conference in Liverpool yesterday, she said: ‘Coming to hospital is a really dehumanising experience. ‘You really do leave your personality and humanity at the doorstep and sometimes even your dignity.’ Dr Granger also warned that, too often, doctors ‘forget the patient’. ‘I’ve been referred to within earshot by several consultants as that girl with DSRCT (desmoplastic small-round-cell tumour). ‘Within one sentence I’d been reduced to just somebody with a rare cancer and nothing else. ‘I’m much more than just a rare cancer, I’m a wife, a daughter, an auntie – auntie to a new baby within a few months.’ She also said staff had kept referring to her as ‘bed 7’. Keeping on: Dr Granger kept up her work as a registrar at St James's Hospital in Leeds (pictured) after her diagnosis . Dr Granger wrote of her battle with cancer in the Daily Mail in 2012. ‘Some senior consultants see a patient’s death as a failure on their part - but death is part of life,’ she said. ‘And there has to be dignity in death. I have led crash teams, done chest compression, seen hundreds of people being resuscitated. It is not like Casualty on television - it’s brutal, undignified, a horrible process with only a small percentage surviving. Why would a seriously-ill person want their body pummelled like that?’ Speaking at the same conference yesterday Tim Kelsey, the NHS executive overseeing controversial plans to harvest data from patients’ medical records, defended the proposals as a means of identifying poor care. The report of Dr Kate Granger’s speech at the NHS Confederation Conference (Mail) omitted reference to her positive message, which is all about improving the NHS. Her ‘Hello, my name is …’ speech, made at the most important healthcare conference of the year, was one of the most powerful I’ve ever witnessed. Her insights into what we must treasure and what needs to change in the NHS are as important as the views of Simon Stevens and Jeremy Hunt. We want to ensure that voices like Kate’s are heard: we had staff and patient voices throughout this year’s conference. We’re building on the dedication of both staff and the public towards the NHS, while working on areas we know we need to improve. Kate is a remarkable woman who has made a huge impression on the health service, both as a practising doctor and as a campaigner for improving care. In years to come, ‘Hello, my name is …’ will be fundamental to the NHS, thanks to Dr Kate Granger.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . In recent months Nasa has been ramping up excitement for sending humans to Mars, outlining its path to the red planet, and showcasing some of the technologies that will help people get there. But as revealed in a 286-page National Research Council (NRC) report commissioned by the agency, Nasa has been warned that its efforts will be doomed to fail if it does not change its methods. The scathing assessment claims that without sufficient funding, a clear goal, or help from nations such as China, Nasa will not be capable of making the next giant leap for mankind. A scathing review of Nasa policy, by the National Research Council, warns that the agency will never land humans on Mars (artist's impression of Curiosity landing shown) if the budget of the agency is not sustained in accordance with inflation. Nasa also needs a clear path to Mars and new partners like China, says the report . According to the NRC's report, Pathways to Exploration - Rationales and Approaches for a U.S. Program of Human Space Exploration, the U.S. should abandon its 'flexible approach' to human missions beyond Earth, set Mars as its ultimate goal and open the door to partnerships with other partners including China. *Note: all three options assume ISS missions have been concluded . Option 1 - A 'giant leap' from moon to Mars . - Return to the moon . - Build a lunar base . - Send humans to the surface of Mars . Option 2 - Least technological risk . - Send humans into lunar orbit . - Visit an asteroid in its own orbit . - Return to the moon's surface . - Explore Martian moons Deimos and Phobos . - Enter orbit around Mars . - Land on the red planet . Option 3 - Nasa's current favoured path . - Robotically capture an asteroid . - Place it in lunar orbit for astronauts to visit . - Travel to the moons of Mars . - Place humans in Martian orbit . - Set foot on Mars . This flexible approach currently involves the construction of a heavy-lift rocket known as the Space Launch System (SLS) and a manned capsule spacecraft called Orion. Both of these are seen as necessities for future missions beyond low-Earth orbit - but as of yet neither has a solid goal beyond a few test flights leading up to 2021. The NRC recommends Nasa chooses one of three stepping-stone approaches toward Mars, that build technological know-how through a series of well-defined preliminary missions. All three options begin with the International Space Station (ISS). The station is seen as vital in testing not only technologies for long-term . space travel, but also the psychological and biological strains that will . be felt by astronauts. However, . the report claims Nasa's current plan of operating the ISS into the . next decade, possibly as far as 2028, alongside assembling the . technologies to land humans on Mars is not feasible. Continuing on this path 'is to invite failure, disillusionment, and the loss of the longstanding international perception that human spaceflight is something the United States does best,' said the NRC in its report. Two of the options then involve sending humans back to the moon, something not favoured by the Obama administration. 'I just have to say pretty bluntly here: We’ve been there before,' Obama said in 2010 when outlining Nasa's space policy for the forthcoming years. President Obama has repeatedly stated his opposition to returning to the moon (artist's illustration of a cancelled Nasa concept shown), saying we have been there before, and should instead look to do new missions such as sending astronauts to an asteroid and ultimately, of course, exploring the surface of Mars . But these paths would be less technologically daunting, NRC panel . co-chairman Jonathan Lunine of Cornell University said. One suggestion is that Nasa could follow the International Space Station program, which currently . costs the United States about £1.8 billion ($3 billion) a year, with a series of lunar . sorties - an outpost on the moon and then a mission to Mars, according to the report. The other moon-based option would follow the space station with human missions to an orbit . beyond the moon, then to an asteroid in its native orbit, then to the . lunar surface, the moons of Mars, Martian orbit and then to Mars itself. This would have the most stops en route to Mars, but poses the least . technological risk because milestones have to be met along the way, claimed the NRC. The third path . includes Nasa's current plan to robotically capture an asteroid, . redirect it into a high orbit around the moon and send astronauts there . to explore. The report suggests that the path should continue with missions to the . moons of Mars, then on to Martian orbit, and finally to the surface of . the planet. Nasa's Orion spacecraft, illustration shown, is due to complete its first unmanned test flight towards the end of this year. The spacecraft will eventually be able to take four astronauts on missions lasting at least 21 days, although this could be extended with a service module currently being researched and developed by Esa . Nasa said it supports the panel's findings. 'There is a consensus that our horizon goal should be a human mission to Mars,' the agency said in a statement. 'The pathways thrust of the report complements Nasa's ongoing approach.' All options will depend heavily on international, private sector and other partnerships, according to the report. 'We're really talking about international collaboration of a different scale than what has been conducted in the past,' Lunine said. In particular, the current relationship of the U.S. with China, which is not a member of the 15-nation space station partnership, needs to be reassessed. 'Given the rapid development of China's capabilities in space, it is in the best interests of the United States to be open to its inclusion in future international partnerships,' says the report. The panel gave no specific estimate of what a Mars mission would cost, but based on past space initiatives the public would support the endeavor. 'There is a temptation to rush to the question of dollars,' panel co-chairman Mitch Daniels said. 'Dollars is the secondary question.' The pathways approach to Mars is 'a very different way of doing business,' Lunine added.","National Research Council has released a report on Nasa in Washington .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS) can see as many as 16 sunrises and sunsets in a 24-hour period. But on some occasions, the location of the station means the sun never sets at all, providing stunning views for the crew on board. Now, Nasa astronaut Reid Wiseman has revealed this incredible sight from orbit, in the first ever Vine video to be sent from space. In certain orbits of the Earth, the sun never sets on the ISS because the space station is in alignment with the day/night terminator line. This line marks the barrier between light and dark on the surface of the Earth. In this scenario, something known as the ‘beta angle’ increases. This is the imaginary line between the sun and the path of the ISS around Earth. When beta angle exceeds 69º, it is in constant sunlight. This happens two to four times a year and is most extreme near the summer solstice on June 21. The timelapse condenses a 92-minute orbit into the span of around six seconds showing the space station hurtling around the planet at  17,500 mph (27,600 km/h). The sun never sets because the space station's orbit comes into alignment with the day and night terminator line. This marks the barrier between light and dark on the surface of the Earth. In this scenario, something known as the ‘beta angle’ increases. This is the imaginary line between the sun and the path of the ISS around Earth. Writing in the Weather Centre blog, Tony Rice explained that as the beta angle gets higher, the time the ISS is in sunlight also increases. The sun never sets because the space station's orbit comes into alignment with the day and night terminator line. This marks the barrier between light and dark on the surface of the Earth . During this period, the so-called ‘beta angle’ increases. This is the imaginary line between the sun and the path of the ISS around Earth. As the beta angle gets higher, the time the ISS is in sunlight increases. When beta angle exceeds 69º, it is in constant sunlight . ‘When beta angle exceeds 69º, it is in constant sunlight, and mission control keeps an even closer around-the-clock watch on power production and temperatures,’ he said. ‘This happens two to four times a year but is most extreme near the summer solstice coming on June 21.’ Previous space shuttles would enter something known as a ‘barbeque mode’ which would cause them to do slow barrel rolls to avoid overheating. On the ISS, an Active Thermal Control System transfers heat through to large radiators extending under the station that can then be released into space. Reid Wiseman from Baltimore (pictured) is currently serving as flight engineer aboard the International Space Station for Expedition 41.   Wiseman’s space Vine has gained over 4,000 likes and nearly 2,000 retweets since it was posted on Saturday . ‘1st Vine from space! Single Earth orbit. Sun never sets flying parallel w/terminator line,’ Wiseman explained in the clip, which he shared over the weekend.

"By . Robin Wylie, Ucl . The canyon-like scars which line Mars' crust are seen by many as evidence for liquid water. But a study now suggests that a different kind of fluid – one much less hospitable to life – may actually have carved these features. On Mars, the most striking topography occurs around the equator. The planet’s low latitudes are dominated by the Tharsis plateau, which hosts several towering volcanoes. The canyon-like scars which line Mars' crust are seen by many as evidence for liquid water.But a study now suggests that a different kind of fluid – one much less hospitable to life – may actually have carved these features. In this image, a geothermal picture of the Martian surface shows the massive gorge system . Not far off sits the solar system’s largest – Olympus Mons. Near the Eastern fringe, however, things start to get deep. There the land dives into a winding maze of valleys and river-like 'outflow channels', the former including the 2,485 miles (4000km)-long Valles Marineris – the 'Grand Canyon' of Mars – which exceeds its terrestrial namesake in every dimension. These great gouges are widely thought to have been formed, at least in part, by flowing water. But according to recently published research, they could have had a very different genesis, linked to the volcanoes to the west. A paper by Giovanni Leone of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, published in the Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research, suggests that the Martian valleys and outflow channels were in fact formed mostly by lava flows, which erupted from the Tharsis plateau in the planet’s distant past. The 2,485 mile (4000km)-long Valles Marineris (pictured) – the 'Grand Canyon' of Mars –  exceeds its namesake in every dimension. These gouges are widely thought to have been formed by flowing water. But according to recently published research, they could have had a very different genesis, linked to the volcanoes to the west . The slopes of a huge Martian volcano, once covered in ice, may have been home to one of the most recent habitable environments to be found on the red planet. Geological landforms discovered on Arsia Mons, the Mars’ third tallest volcano, suggest that lakes could have existed on the planet 210 million years ago. Researchers believe the lakes may have been home to bacteria and other single-celled organisms which evolved at the same time as dinosaurs began appearing on Earth. Nearly twice as tall as Mount Everest, Arsia Mons would have produced intense heat from eruptions that melted massive amounts of ice to form englacial lakes. These are bodies of water that form within glaciers like bubbles in a half-frozen ice cube. The ice-covered lakes of Arsia Mons would have held hundreds of cubic miles of meltwater, according to calculations by Kat Scanlon, a graduate student at Brown University in New York. And where there’s water, there’s the possibility of a habitable environment. ‘This is interesting because it’s a way to get a lot of liquid water very recently on Mars,’ Ms Scanlon said. To draw this conclusion, Professor Leone scrutinised thousands of images from Nasa's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) spacecraft, which has been orbiting the planet since 2006. This allowed him to map the floors of the equatorial valleys and outflow channels at an extremely high resolution of up to 25cm per pixel. These images appear to show extensive lava flows draping the floors of many of the valleys and channels. Around 90 per cent of the floors look to be covered either by lava or by lava-related landslides. The morphology of the lava flows Professor Leone encountered suggest that the lava actually incised the valleys and channels in the first place. The MRO images seem to show that channels formed by the freshly erupted lava were later deepened and widened by the passage of liquid rock. This type of erosion, Professor Leone argues, can explain the existence of the valleys and outflow channels without the need to invoke significant amounts of liquid water. The valleys and outflow channels are believed to be many billion years old. Professor Leone believes the lava would have been emitted by now-vanished volcanoes somewhere on the Tharsis plateau, forerunners of the region’s (relatively juvenile) modern volcanoes. The Grand Canyon of Mars – Valles Marineris is pictured here.  Here lava tunnels seem to have collapsed, forming 'pit chains' – long curvilinear depressions in the crust . Professor Leone believes that every stage of this volcanic erosion process is visible in the MRO images. The first stage, he concludes, can be seen in the locations closest to today’s Tharsis volcanoes, at the western end of Valles Marineris. Here lava tunnels seem to have collapsed, forming 'pit chains' – long curvilinear depressions in the crust. Further east, where the terrain deepens, the pit chains seem to have been further eroded, by the injection of yet more lava, into more extensive channels – first into 'fossae' and later into larger 'chasmata'. The MRO images showed relatively little evidence for the past presence of liquid water in the valleys and outflow channels, which can be inferred by the presence of 'light toned deposits' in the images. This, Professor Leone believes, adds further weight to the theory that these features are igneous in origin. These are radical conclusions. While a volcanic origin for Mars' valleys and outflow channels had been proposed before (in the wake of Nasa's Viking mission in the 1970s, this was actually the prevailing theory), for the past 25 years, scientific opinion has drifted towards an explanation involving a mixture of tectonic uplift and sedimentary erosion caused by water. The study is unlikely to change the Esa's travel plans. Professor Leone’s research, while intriguing, is far from conclusive, according to UCL researcher Robin Wylie . The distinction between sedimentary and igneous rocks reaches far beyond geology. If, as the majority of scientists still believe, the valleys and outflow channels once contained significant volumes of water, then they are naturally prime candidates for future missions on the hunt for life. For instance, the European Space Agency’s ExoMars rover, due to touch down in 2019, is considering landing sites around Valles Marineris. If Professor Leone’s conclusion is accurate, however, and these features are instead mostly volcanogenic, this implies that much less water was present during their formation. If this turns out to be true, their suitability as landing sites could be called into question. This would not spell doom for the chances of finding life on Mars. If Professor Leone is right, it simply means that less liquid water existed in this particular corner of the planet. It would say little about Mars' total water inventory. In any case, this study is unlikely to change the Esa's travel plans. Professor Leone’s research, while intriguing, is far from conclusive. It is notoriously tough to tell between igneous and sedimentary rocks using orbital images, even at the resolution offered by the MRO. A definitive answer, then, will have to wait. But let’s hope not at the cost of another expensive mission which comes up dry.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . The outlook is sunny for an experimental solar aircraft set to circumnavigate the globe next year, after it has successfully made its maiden flight. The Solar Impulse 2 HB-SIB took off from Payerne airbase in Switzerland today and successfully soared above the clouds for more than an hour before landing safely. The solar-powered plane has no fuel on board and with a wingspan of 236ft (72 metres), it is larger than a Boeing 747-8I jet liner. It weighs around the same as a car at 382 stone (2,300kg). Sunny outlook for the record attempt: The Solar Impulse 2 HB-SIB (pictured) took off from Payerne airbase in Switzerland today and successfully soared above the clouds for over an hour before landing safely . The revolutionary single-seater aircraft is made of carbon fibre. It has a 236ft (72 metre) wingspan - larger than that of the Boeing 747-8I. But it weighs just 2,300kg - equivalent to a car. The 17,000 solar cells built into the wings supply four electric motors (17.5 CV each) with renewable energy. During the day, the solar cells recharge lithium batteries weighing  2,077lbs (633 Kg) which allow the aircraft to fly at night and therefore to have virtually unlimited autonomy. No fuel is carried aboard the aircraft. It is set to become the first solar-powered plane to fly around the world thanks to its vast wings covered in 17,000 solar cells, which supply four electric motors. German test pilot Markus Scherdel flew the cutting-edge machine, which is the second solar plane in the Solar Impulse Project. He also flew the first prototype aircraft in 2009. Writing in a blog on the Solar Impulse website, the team said: ‘It is a great moment for everyone who has built this revolutionary solar airplane… . 'All of this hard work to reach next year our ultimate goal: the attempt of the first round-the-world solar flight... only powered by solar energy’. The solar aircraft of Bertrand Piccard and André Borschberg is a single-seater and was flown for over one hour ‘in line with calculations and simulations,’ Solar Impulse said. Flying high: German test pilot Markus Scherdel flew the cutting-edge machine, which is the second solar plane in the Solar Impulse Project . Pilots Bertrand Piccard and André  Borschberg will take turns in the single-seater cockpit of the Solar Impulse 2 plane. Their five month mission is set to begin in March 2015 and last for five months. The plane is completely solar-powered with no fuel on-board. They will make a 22,000mile (35,000km) journey over approximately 500 flying hours. There will be 10 legs, some of which will last for more than five days and nights. A team of 60 people will support them. The two co-founders of the project will pilot the plane themselves for a record-breaking attempt in 2015. Before then, there will be several other flights taking place in the coming months so that the plane can be obtain certification. Mr Borschberg, co-founder, pilot and CEO of Solar Impulse, said: ‘This inaugural flight is an important stage - a step closer towards the round-the-world flight. ‘It is also . a huge emotional step for the entire team and all our partners who have . worked on the aircraft. Si2 incorporates a vast amount of new . technology to render it more efficient, reliable and in particular . better adapted to long haul flights.

"By . Deni Kirkova . He might be a future king but the Duke of Cambridge has revealed he likes the simple things in life such as good value food and popular music. William said Morrisons Value pasta was 'not too bad', and confessed to listening to Coldplay - and American rock band Linkin Park - while chatting to school children today. The Prince spent more than an hour at Goole High School, in East Yorkshire to launch a new award for primary school children as royal patron of the charity SkillForce, which draws on the values and skills of ex-forces personnel to inspire young people to achieve at school. The Duke of Cambridge visits Goole High School to launch the new SkillForce Junior Prince's Award . He spent some of his time apologising to the youngsters for the pouring rain. 'I'm so sorry I didn't bring better weather with me,' the Duke said to flag-waving pupils as he arrived. He watched the youngsters take part in a team bridge-building exercise in the school yard which was inspired by the 70th anniversary of D-Day later this week. As he chatted to members of the school's samba band, which was providing the musical accompaniment, he refused an offer to play one of the drums. He told one of the drummers: 'I used to play the piano, trumpet and drums when I was your age but I couldn't read music. There's only so much you can remember from the top of your head.' And when one of the band asked him what music he liked, the Duke was heard to reply: 'I really like Coldplay, Linkin Park.' The Duke is Royal Patron of charity SkillForce, which draws on the values and skills of ex-forces personnel to inspire young people to achieve at school . Inside the school, William chatted to pupils taking part in the Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme who told him about their expedition planning. Inspecting a packet of Morrisons Value instant pasta and cheese, he said: 'Have you tried this before? It's OK, it's not too bad. 'It's better than the beef stew and dumplings which is quite a heavy one.' William chatted about the SkillForce initiative with staff, pupils and representatives of the charity. The new SkillForce Junior Prince's Award is aimed at nine and 10-year-olds, especially under-privileged children who do not have easy access to these kind of activities. Inspecting a packet of Morrisons Value instant pasta and cheese, he said: 'Have you tried this before? It's OK' It is particularly aimed as smoothing the transition for children between primary and secondary school. The award involves team-building and problem-solving challenges, team sports, outdoor pursuits including camping, first aid, navigation, observing remembrance and community projects. Goole High School has worked with a group of local primary schools to develop the new national award programme. Speaking before the visit, Peter Cross, chief executive of SkillForce, said: 'The award is designed to engage younger learners in exciting lessons, challenges and community projects that prepare them for secondary education, a time when some students can begin to lose their way. After his school visit the Duke attended an employment workshop session with youth homeless charity Centrepoint . 'Our programme builds up the children's confidence, resilience, team work and problem solving to give them a boost before the start of new adventures and encourage them to take a more active role in their town, city or village. 'It's SkillForce's 10th birthday, and we are honoured that our royal patron has marked the occasion by lending his support to the Junior Prince's Award for roll-out across the country.' Hundreds of children and local residents stood and waved in the rain as the duke left by helicopter from the school field. He arrived by car earlier after his planned helicopter touch-down was cancelled due to the weather. Afterwards, William travelled to West Yorkshire where he visited the youth homeless charity Centrepoint's base in Bradford.

From the steps of the 19th century Town Hall, the riders will head northwest out of the city centre and into the countryside. They will pass Harewood House, home of the Lascelles family for over 250 years, before they head to Skipton, the gateway to the Yorkshire Dales National Park. Up to this point the route is fairly flat, but once they enter the iconic Dales the terrain gets steeper as the riders race a semi-circular route across the contours of the valleys. They head up to the north east edge of the National Park, before sweeping south through Leyburn and the cathedral city of Ripon. The competitors will rejoin flat roads as they speed towards the pretty spa town of Harrogate. There, the first yellow jersey wearer of the Tour will be announced. Stage 2, out of 21, starts in nearby York. A third stage on July 7 will start in London, which hosted the Grand Depart seven years ago. Yorkshire's successful bid to host the start of the 101st Tour de France was announced in December 2012. A statement from the Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO), whichs runs the event, said: 'After an outstanding 2012 for British cycling, marked by the historical victory of Bradley Wiggins on the Tour de France, the United Kingdom will again hold pride of place in 2014.' Since then, organisers have been working full-time planning the route. The Team Sky line-up has yet to be announced. Last year, British cyclist Chris Froome, then 28, led the nine-person team into the race, starting in Corsica.","Rapha Tempest Festival will host bands and cycling races at start of route .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Remarkable maps of Earth drawn by British theologian Thomas Burnet in 1694 reveal a strange view of planet Earth. His maps appeared in his somewhat controversial book called Sacred Theory of the Earth, which sought to account for ‘irregularities’ on ‘God’s planet’ such as mountains and canyons. These particular maps were intended to prove that our planet was once a perfect sphere but lost its shape because it was battered by the Great Flood survived by Noah, as recounted by the Bible. This very scarce and unusual map of the world, shown as if the oceans were dried up, was created by Englishman Thomas Burnet in 1694 in his attempt at a scientific account of the origins of Earth. Shown here is a somewhat accurate drawing of Europe and Asia - without nearby bodies of water . Burnet’s theory was that Earth was once completely smooth when, as written in the Bible, it was created by God - whom Burnet said strived for perfection, reports Mark Strauss for io9. But, as is evident across the planet, Earth is not smooth - it is covered in bumps and dents such as hills, valleys and so on. Burnet was certain, therefore, that our planet must once have been smooth, but it was later shaped by a huge event, namely the Great Flood. His maps show the world, with the landmasses known at the time, and how he expected them to be if the oceans and seas were removed. This reveals the land underneath that was once apparently our planet’s surface. If the ideas seem radical now, they were not well received either in 1694, but Burnet was adamant his theory was successful. ‘We have now proved our explication [making clear] of the deluge to be more than an idea, or to be a true piece of natural history; and it may be the greatest and most remarkable that hath yet been since the beginning of the world,’ he wrote. ‘We have shown it to be the real account of Noah's Flood, according to authority both divine and humane; and I would willingly proceed one step further, and declare my thoughts concerning the manner and order wherein Noah's Flood came to pass.' The canyon-like scars which line Mars' crust are seen by many as evidence for liquid water. But . a study now suggests that a different kind of fluid - one much less . hospitable to life - may actually have carved these features. On . Mars, the most striking topography occurs around the equator. The . planet’s low latitudes are dominated by the Tharsis plateau, which hosts . several towering volcanoes. Not far off sits the solar system’s largest – Olympus Mons. Near the Eastern fringe, however, things start to get deep. There . the land dives into a winding maze of valleys and river-like 'outflow . channels', the former including the 2,485 miles (4000km)-long Valles . Marineris – the 'Grand Canyon' of Mars – which exceeds its terrestrial . namesake in every dimension. These . great gouges are widely thought to have been formed, at least in part, . by flowing water. But according to recently published research, they . could have had a very different genesis, linked to the volcanoes to the . west. A . paper by Giovanni Leone of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, . published in the Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research, . suggests that the Martian valleys and outflow channels were in fact . formed mostly by lava flows, which erupted from the Tharsis plateau in . the planet’s distant past. Burney's scientific explanation for Earth's origin appears in his 1694 book Sacred Theory of the Earth. The work is a curious blend of geography and archaeology, which aroused considerable interest at the time. California is shown as an Island in the sketch of the US . Shown here are ideas of different stages in the formation of Earth taken from Burnet's book. On the left can be seen his cutaway of Earth showing how the 'body of the Earth is still entire' he writes, with the centre 'consum'd by fire'. On the right is a drawing on how water may have been transported around a 'smooth' Earth . Burnet goes on to state that as ‘the Ark was born upon the waters’ the rains broke the planet, opening an ‘abyss’ into which the water drained, creating the seas and oceans. The rain would have fallen ‘throughout the face of the whole Earth’ and would have had ‘a considerable effect on that Earth, being even and smooth.’ He then suggests that the rain would have run into ‘chasms made by the sun’ and, through a process of evaporation, gradually formed Earth as we know it today. Burnet wasn’t entirely beyond reason, however, as he went on to state that he was willing for hideas to be scrutinised - although he hints that some might not be sincere in their own studies. ‘I know how subject we are to mistakes in these great and remote things, when we descend to particulars,’ he wrote. ‘But I am willing to expose the theory to a full trial, and to shew the way for any to examine it, provided they do it with equity and sincerity.’ Burnet had various other theories for what Earth might have looked like both in the past and present, on the interior and on its surface. Most of these aimed to show how Earth was shaped by the supposed bilblical flood. For example top left can be seen Earth's surface cracking, while Fig 3 shows the 'formation' of continents . Today oceans cover 71 per cent of Earth's surface, with land accounting for just 29 per cent. This water is spread across various vast oceans and seas. This image from the Goes satellite in 2008 shows the moment four storms were lined up on the Atlantic, with one in the Eastern Pacific .","British theologian Thomas Burnet's created maps of 'ancient Earth' in 1694 .

Saying the FIFA president's decision to run for a fifth term in 2015 was 'disappointing' today, Mr Gill added: 'The very fact in 2011 he was clear it was just for four years, that should have been the situation. To change his mind is disappointing. He added: 'I think we need to move on. I think we need a full, frank and open debate about what Fifa needs going forward.' Scroll down for video . Vice-chairman David Gill, pictured, has said Sepp Blatter should not stand for re-election as president of FIFA . Mr Gill . also challenged Mr Blatter on his astonishing attack on the British media. 'The statement from Mr Blatter yesterday was totally unacceptable and . factually incorrect. 'To try to portray it as a racist or discriminatory . attack is sheer ... totally unacceptable.' Mr Gill . agreed Mr Blatter's comments had left 'a stain' on FIFA. The move came just hours after former UEFA president Lennart Johansson also called for Blatter not to stand again. Following UEFA's Congress meeting in Sao Paulo, Johannson said: 'I think it is time he went.' After Blatter spoke to UEFA's . Congress to announce his intention to stand for a fifth term as . president, both FA chairman Greg Dyke and Dutch football federation . president Michael van Praag spoke out against the Swiss.

They said they had no confidence in Mr Blatter to oversee the change that FIFA needs in the light of these corruption scandals. This followed Van Praag's earlier comments, in an interview with a Dutch newspaper, that Blatter had to shoulder much of the blame for the tarnished image of the world governing body in the light of corruption allegations around the Qatar 2022 World Cup bid. 'Mr Blatter, this is nothing personal but if you look at FIFA's reputation over the last seven or eight years, it is being linked to all kinds of corruption and all kinds of old boys' networks things,' Van Praag said he had told Mr Blatter in the meeting from which reporters were barred. 'FIFA has an executive president and you are not making things easy for yourself and I do not think you are the man for the job any longer. 'I told him ""I like you very much ... this is nothing personal. But you are now saying that Qatar was the wrong choice (for the 2022 World Cup), but you are not blaming yourself you are blaming your executive committee. 'Yesterday you said something about racism against Qatar and people are not taking you seriously any more. This is not good for FIFA and it is not good for the game. 'Yes you are leading the reforms at the moment, but all these problems occurred in the period before the reforms and you were still president and you responsible and I believe you should not run any more.""' Kicking up a storm: Dyke, pictured during a England promotional event last week, has spoken out against Blatter .

Blatter attended UEFA’s Congress on Tuesday morning ahead of FIFA Congress – he required the protection of Sao Paulo’s Shock Battalion riot police officers to gain access to The Renaissance hotel where UEFA are staying – and Van Praag said he expected  members of Europe’s governing body to be united in opposing Blatter at next year’s presidential election. ‘The election for the FIFA presidency is only next year but it will be good if Europe is well prepared and ready to make its choice,’ he said. ‘If you are in a post for 16 years there comes a time when you have to ask whether you are still contributing.’ Not holding back: Jack Warner criticised Sepp Blatter during interview with ITV . The day began on Monday with a former Blatter ally – the now disgraced Jack Warner – claiming FIFA would not change until 78-year-old Blatter had gone. After three decades on ExCo a corruption scandal forced Warner to quit in 2011, having been linked to payments made by the man at the centre of the current Qatar scandal, Mohamed Bin Hammam. And while Blatter is expected to tell Congress this week that he intends to stand for a fifth term, Warner said: ‘If Blatter had one modicum of decency he wouldn’t even be at FIFA still. ‘I have been with FIFA for 30 years....I am still the longest serving elected officer of FIFA, and under Mr Blatter?

"By . Catherine Eade . Think your car is safe in the hands of private parking firms? Drivers travelling from Gatwick who entrust their cars to firms close to the airport might want to check the credentials of the company before handing over their keys. Gatwick Airport parking firm Gold Parking is one firm which has allegedly been revealed to be a 'rogue trader' by BBC1 programme Watchdog. The BBC says the parking company was caught leaving holidaymakers' cars in random locations such as side streets and even town centres when they assumed they were being parked in a secure car park. A parking firm taking Gatwick Airport passengers' cars to 'secure parking' allegedly left them on side streets (File pic) One customer told the TV show that her car had an extra 1,500 miles on the clock when she returned . The internet site for Gold Parking describes the company as 'the most affordable and convenient Meet and Greet Parking Company at Gatwick Airport' and claims, 'All our compounds are 24/7 manned'. One customer told the TV show that her car had an extra 1,500 miles on the clock when she returned, while another reported that their Mercedes had been stolen. The show's presenter Matt Allwright and his team secretly checked to see whether the firm had a secure car park by providing three fake customers who handed over cars to Gold Parking. The customers were charged £90 for one week and £150 for two weeks to have their vehicle taken to the company's 'secure car park', but on each occasion the cars were left out in the open in Crawley, in communal public carparks, outside shops and in a residential side street. Exposed: Gold Parking, exposed by Watchdog on the BBC parked some cars in the Three Bridges Community Centre . Secure? Other cars were parked in a residential road in Crawley called Thatcher Close . Gatwick Airport has an approved list of parking firms and Gold Parking is not one of them . Crawley residents told the BBC they often saw unfamiliar vehicles left in the open for days on end. The BBC show, which aired last Wednesday, featured Dipesh Toor, who left his £45,000 Mercedes with Gold Parking and returned to find it had been stolen. The company told Watchdog it did have access to a secure compound which it shared with other companies. It claimed Mr Toor's Mercedes was stolen from within this car park. Brenda Jones left her Audi A7 with Gold Parking while on honeymoon in Cuba, and when she returned found the car was dirty, had a ripped tyre and an extra 1,500 miles on the clock. The couple subsequently received a parking fine in the post, stating the vehicle had been parked in a residents' parking space without a permit and two weeks later another fine arrived for a pay and display space. TravelMail was unable to contact Gold Parking on repeated occasions, and its website has been removed.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Anyone who has a fear of elevators may want to avoid the world’s tallest building when it's completed in four years’ time. The Kingdom Tower in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia will feature the world’s fastest double-decker elevator, capable of ascending and descending the mighty skyscraper at 32ft (10 metres) a second. This lift will let visitors travel more than 2,165ft (660 metres) in one go, so they can quickly climb the building that will measure an unprecedented 3,281ft (1km) tall. The Kingdom Tower in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, . (illustrated left) will feature the world’s fastest double-decker elevator that will ascend . the mighty skyscraper at 32ft (10 metres) a second when it is built. It will use UltraRope technology (pictured right) which is significantly lighter than conventional steel cable . The shape of the tower is designed to reduce 'wind load' which increases with height. Its tapering wings are an aerodynamic shape to reduce structural loading due to wind. It is a similar shape to the Burj Khalifa tower in Dubai, which also has quite a stiff shape. The differing shapes at different levels mean wind loads will go around the building. One of the challenges is to build the tower so that it is not too rigid, but not too flexible so that it is unstable or people feel nauseous. Another challenge for super tall buildings is the use of lifts and fire escapes, which in effect mean expensive unusable space. The challenge of pumping concrete so high up a single, pressurised pipe is a huge engineering undertaking. Santeri Suoranta, director of high-rise technology, at Kone, - the company that makes the lifts -  told MailOnline that users shouldn't feel feel queasy on their speedy journey to the top of the tower. The most significant effect of shooting upwards or downwards at such a speed is that your ears can 'pop' as inner and outer ear pressure levels need time to adjust. It is likely that some users will feel their ears readjust. 'When travelling at speed in an elevator, the main factors to consider are vertical and lateral vibrations, noise and pressure change,' a spokesman for Kone said. 'In our latest lifts, we try and make sure that all of these elements are as balanced as possible to create a pleasurable elevator travel experience. 'Based on user research we know that 10 m/s is still at a comfortable level to travel,' so users should not feel ill. A number of the elevators will be installed in the building. They will use ‘high-tech carbon fibre cables and ‘UltraRope’ technology, which will one day enable elevators to travel up to 3,281ft (1,000m) in one go. It is claimed the lightweight cable has the potential to transform skylines around the world, and by building upwards, will create living space for the world’s burgeoning and increasingly urban population. The technology has been designed to match the strength of steel cables, while being much lighter. It is made of up to four bands of carbon fibre encased in a custom Epoxy coating that increases friction and reduces slippage. The elevator (illustrated in a GIF) will use high-tech carbon fibre cables. This so-called UltraRope technology means that lifts will one day be able to travel up to 3,281ft (1,000m) in one go . As buildings get taller, more steel cable has to be used to haul up the lifts – and lower them again safely. By uing conventional cable, architects are therefore limited at how high they can build. In a 1,640 feet (500m) lift shaft, for example, up to three-quarters of the energy needed to move an elevator is expended on the weight on the cables themselves. This distance is considered the maximum that conventional cables can handle without snapping. Weight and steel’s limited ability to bend means the energy required to operate an elevator rises exponentially with height. The Finnish company claims that its rope reduces the weight of the cabling by 90 per cent and consequently cuts energy requirements too. Problem solving: Engineers have to solve . multiple problems to build the tower, from reducing the structure's . weight and making it sway the right amount, to piping concrete almost . more than half a mile (1 km) into the sky. Artists' impressions of the towering . structure are pictured left and right . Centre piece: The skyscraper is intended to be the centre piece of the Kingdom City development beside the Red Sea and will have 200 floors, 160 of which would be habitable. This is an image of what it might be like to look down from the structure . The new cable was tested in the company’s lab, located in a 1.90 feet (333m) mine, and is designed to be resistant to wear and abrasion, reducing repair costs and the time spend out of service. It is one of the first details confirmed about the skyscraper. The construction of the world’s tallest tower is underway and when it is completed in 2018, it will have the world’s fastest double-decker lifts as well as the highest elevator rise. The Kingdom Tower will house offices, a hotel, apartments and a vertigo-inducing observation spot. In total, it will have 65 lifts and escalators, including seven double-decker lifts built by Kone. The tower is the centre piece, and is the first construction phase of the Kingdom City development, located along the Red Sea on the north side of Jeddah. The cable has been designed to match the strength of steel cables while being much lighter. It is made of up to four bands of carbon fibre encased in a custom Epoxy coating that increases friction and reduces slippage. It is shown in-situ on a pulley system . The proposed tower is estimated to cost $1.23bn and would be 568ft (173metres) taller than Dubai's Burj Khalifa tower, which is currently the world's tallest building (pictured)","The Kingdom Tower will have the world’s fastest double-decker elevator .

"By . Sam Webb . A new concept car has been unveiled by Mini bringing the formally small hatchback into the supercar league. The Mini Superleggera Vision is a sporty roadster with a long profile, a sharp departure from the car maker's usual iconic compact designs. Billed as an 'exclusive interpretation of an open-top two-seater', the Vision was created by the BMW Group-owned Mini and Touring Superleggera, an automative design and coach building firm based in Milan, Italy, that often works with the likes of Aston Martin and Lamborghini. Bold: Mini has teamed up with an Italian firm famous for working with the likes of Aston Martin and Lamborghini to build a sports car - the Mini Superleggera Vision . Although it features classic Mini design features like the rounded headlights and hexagonal grill, the concept is a sporty roadster instead of the usaul compact runabout . Elegant: The interior features high-end materials such as leather, aluminium and black chrome . Eschewing the small dimensions that have made the car firm famous throughout the world, the concept features a stretched bonnet and long wheelbase of a sports car. The electric vehicle was constructed from hand-shaped metal sheeting and the interior features high-end materials such as leather, aluminium and black chrome. The front features the traditional Mini design features - two circular headlights and a hexagonal grille. The classic Mini bonnet stripes are three-dimensionally embossed and run on into high-quality polished aluminum accents. 'It was a pleasure for me to design a concept like this,' said Anders Warming, head of Mini Design. 'The Mini Superleggera Vision elegantly perpetuates what the Classic Mini started 55 years ago: reduction to the essentials. 'Its . energetic, minimalistic design embodies the dynamic essence of an . automobile. At the same time it creates unique emotional beauty in . combining the past and future of the automotive industry, i.e. traditional coachwork craftsmanship and modern design styling.' Pride: The British flag, reflecting Mini's historic roots, is incorporated into the car's rear lights . The exclusive model has been created especially for this year's Concorso d¿Eleganza Villa d'Este, a classic car festival at Lake Como . Striking: The dashboard is created from a single aluminium sheet . Compare.... ... and contrast. The Superleggera and this 1964 Mini Cooper are worlds apart . Despite the radical departure of the design, petrolheads on Twitter were largely unaninimous in their praise of the bold concept, calling it 'stunning, 'electrifying' and 'simply beautiful'. 'MINI and Touring both believe that proportions are the key factor of beauty, and share the same values of essentiality and innovation' says Louis de Fabribeckers, head of design at Touring Superleggera. 'In this car all unnecessary equipment or decoration is sacrificed, as performance is gained through lightness and efficiency of the bodywork and interior. The Italian touch is in the proportions and the typical waistline.' The exclusive model has been created especially for this year’s Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este, a classic car festival at Lake Como. 'The striking fin defines the look of the rear, adding a touch of extravagance' There are very few gaps in the body since it is constructed from large sheets of metal .

In London, it is illegal for private vehicles to operate with taxi meters, but California-based Uber, which operates in 110 cities, gets round this law because the machines that monitor distance travelled and journey time are smartphones and are not physically attached to the vehicles. Uber has attracted demonstrations and litigation in nine other cities. Nevertheless, customers love it because, with a couple of swipes of a finger, the app gets rid of waiting in the cold and waving down cabs. Uber allows clients to use their phone to book a private driver (who will have taken out commercial insurance and undergone a criminal records check). They can also track the car using the app’s live map. Threat: Uber's app is marketed as a way for drivers to start their own taxi business . Customers can see the  driver’s name and photo before they arrive and receive an email of their route to ensure they have not gone around the houses. Uber takes a cut, usually 11 to 20 per cent, of the fares, which are taken from customers’ credit cards at the end of the journey — when they can also rate their trip. Journey costs increase during busy periods, but customers are not encouraged to tip because the gratuity is factored into the metered fare.","Cabbies to launch protest on June 11 against new taxi app Uber .

Prosecuting, Hanifa Patel said Underdown was caught out by mobile phone evidence linking him to the robbers. She added: 'The victim arrived outside his home at 11.45pm and as he got out of his car he was approached by McDermott and Lynch. 'They began to hit him all over, the face the head and the body. As one hit him the other tried to snatch the takings. The victim gave chase and was struck again and that caused him to stop.' Underdown's solicitor Adrian Williams said: 'He’s not a sophisticated man. He has not been before a court and has no convictions. 'It’s my submission Lynch and McDermott had planned a robbery and befriended the defendant. He’s been incredibly foolish and deeply regrets what he’s done.' Preston Crown Court heard that Thomas Lynch, left and Martin McDermott, right, trailed the victim from the shop to his home with the £25,000 takings in a bag where they attacked him outside his house in Accrington . Judge Anthony Russell told Underdown: 'It must be understood those who give information to criminals to enable them to commit crime will receive punishment. 'You later told police there was an element of revenge. 'The robbery may not have occurred had you not given that information. 'It’s very sad to see a man with an exemplary character other than this before the court facing such a serious charge.' McDermott was ordered to pay Mr Akhter £7,040 compensation following a Proceeds of Crime hearing. Preston Crown Court heard that McDermott, 25, of Fulwood, Lancs and Lynch, 26, currently in HMP Preston are already serving 40 months and four years respectively for the robbery. Mr Akhter told the court: 'I had helped him out financially when he got into trouble with a County Court Judgement. 'I feel totally betrayed, and it has made me not trust other people, which isn’t nice. I was shocked when I found he was involved.' His wife, Shazia Akhter added: 'After the robbery he carried on working for us, playing with our children when they came into the shop.'","Anthony Underdown worked in the shop in Lancashire for three years .

"By . Leon Watson . and Kieran Corcoran . Family feuds can drive people to take drastic action – however most don't go to the extreme lengths of building a house just to spite a sibling. This is Boston's skinniest house that was built by an enraged brother after he returned from war to find the land he'd inherited had been mostly taken by his brother. The slender house measures just 10.4ft at its widest point and tapers to a mere 9.25ft at its narrowest. Inside the home the narrowest interior point is just 6ft 2 inches and the ceilings are just 6 ft, 4 inches high. The skinny house in Boston, Massachusetts, was built by an enraged brother after he returned from war to find the land he'd inherited had been mostly taken by his brother . The wooden house was erected with the main purpose of blocking out sunlight and spoiling his brother's view of the nearby river . It has the uncontested distinction of being the narrowest house in Boston, Massachusetts, sitting at 44 Hull St in the North End area of the city. However whilst it now may attract tourists and can even be rented out, the story behind the house has a tumultuous beginning. As the story goes, two brothers who each inherited land from their deceased father got into a dispute shortly after the American Civil War. Whilst the second brother was away serving in the military, the first brother built a large home on the land, leaving the soldier a shred of the property. The back of the skinny house in Boston, Massachusetts, (left) and (right) a door entrance, which rather unusually, is not found on the front of the property . The number of the skinny house in Boston, Massachusetts . The first brother thought there was no room for his serving brother to build land on. But when he returned, he wanted to spite his brother for what he'd done. So the wooden house was erected with the main purpose of blocking out sunlight and spoiling his brother's view of the nearby river. The current owners once described to the Boston Globe newspaper what it's like to hold a party there. Legend has it that in 1874, two brothers got into a dispute after each had previously inherited land from their deceased father . Jennifer Simonic said: 'We had a party of 10 one New Year's Eve, and when one person has to go to the bathroom, everyone has to move.' Ms Simonic, 44, also explained how there are only five doors in the house and the bathroom and the living room are one of the few rooms actually separated by a door. Each floor is a different room. The young daughter's bedroom shares the third floor with a closet. The second floor is the living room and bathroom. The top floor is the couple's master bedroom and home office. 'Instead of doors we have floors between each space and for guests we have to put a mattress down on the closet floor if they want to sleep.' With only 964 square feet to work with, any person staying the skinny house has to be creative with their space. The family is also used to being a tourist attraction, and has found people sitting in their backyard taking photos before. At its 6'2"" narrowest, a tall person can touch the opposing walls with outstretched arms. Marblehead, Massachusetts, is the home to potentially the first example of a spite house in the U.S. - appropriately enough now known as The Old Spite House. Like the above example in Boston, it was again a case of two brothers feuding over land. After one steamed ahead and built his wooden house, with views over the nearby Salem Sound, in 1716 his brother Thomas Wood constructed a home just 10ft wide as revenge. Dispute: Two brothers were also behind the spite house in Marblehead, Massachusetts, pictured above . An even smaller house was constructed in Alexandria, Virginia, in 1830. The bright blue building measures just 7ft wide, and is inhabited to this day. Before it came into being, the narrow space it now occupies was an alleyway, which would often be crammed with horse-and-cart traffic and unwanted loiterers. So owner John Hollensbury built the home, which extends 25ft back, to win himself some peace and quiet. Roadblock: This house in Alexandria, Virginia, (centre, blue) was built in 1830 to stop traffic using an alleway. It is just 7ft wide . Meanwhile in Freeport, New York, a Victorian landowner managed to change the whole shape of his town with an inconsiderately-placed home. Despite the city's intention to lay out its streets in a perfect grid, the property developer insisted on setting out his home on a triangular piece of land, which planners had to build around. Defiant: This house was built on a triangular plot of land, ruining plans to arrange Freeport, New York into blocks . Bone of contention: The roads are arranged into neat right angles until it hits the offending triangular point - forcing the road around . One spite house in England came into being because of a land war with a church. In Gainford, England, when reverend Jospeh Edleston died, his family were keen to memorialise him with a monument in the churchyard. But Church of England authorities refused permission and instead suggesting the family donate their own land to the church and build the tower. Incensed, the family instead built a house of their own on the land with a 40ft column sticking out of it, which was completed in 1904.","The slender house in Boston measures just 10.4ft at its widest point .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Jailed: Daniel Lovick, 27, has been jailed for two years after punching his girlfriend's stomach in an attempt to abort the baby . A man who punched his pregnant girlfriend in the stomach in an attempt to abort their baby has been jailed. Daniel Lovick, 27, became angry when his partner revealed she was pregnant and made repeated threats about how he would terminate the pregnancy. He pushed her down the stairs of her home, pulled out a clump of her hair and punched and kicked her in the stomach. Lovick, who has a history of violence against women, escaped a longer sentence because the baby survived, a court heard. He was a friend of the victim’s brother and began a relationship with her when she started visiting him in prison. He started being abusive upon learning of the pregnancy just before Easter, telling his partner: 'You better get rid of that baby or I’ll kick it out of you.' At 8.15am on May 19, he arrived at her home in Hull, East Yorkshire, let himself in and began shouting and swearing. She asked him to leave but he refused. He told her: 'You better go to the clinic and get rid of it. If you don’t, I’ll get a coat hanger and drag it out of you or I’ll stab you.' Lovick then grabbed her and pushed her down a flight of stairs - seven steps in total - and she looked up to see him running towards her. He grabbed her hair and began punching her in the stomach, saying: 'You’re not having the baby, I’m going to kick it out of you.' The woman tried to protect her stomach by raising a leg. Continuing the attack after she had got up, Lovick threatened to stab her, punched her 'three or four times' and pushed his thumb into her eye. The victim managed to make a phone call to Lovick’s mother, who heard him in the background making further threats against the unborn child. Hull Crown Court heard that before he left the property, he threw clothes around, pulled the blinds down, and smeared porridge on the walls. The woman was taken to hospital, where a friend who saw her said she appeared to be 'in agony'. She was bruised and had a bald patch at the back of her head where her hair had been pulled out, but the baby was unharmed. Sentencing: The judge branded Lovick a 'violent bully' as he passed sentence at Hull Crown Court . Two . days later, police saw Lovick walking down a road in west Hull, and he . was arrested after attempting to hide in a garden. When questioned about . the assault he claimed she was 'paranoid' and had slapped him. The victim later described herself as being 'nervous, on edge' and 'frightened to be at home'. Lovick, from Hull, who had 19 previous convictions for 34 offences, admitted assault occasioning actual bodily harm and criminal damage. His own barrister, John Thackray, described the attack as 'disgraceful'. Jailing Lovick for two years and three months, Judge Michael Mettyear, Honorary recorder of Hull and the East Riding, told him: 'You are a violent bully. 'You’ve got a terrible record, including offences of violence against women. You are a great risk to anybody who should be foolish enough to take up with you. 'You just can’t keep your temper and can’t keep your hands to yourself. This was a nasty attack on this woman and you ought to be ashamed of yourself. 'Fortunately, she wasn’t badly injured. Had you caused her to lose the baby or injured her further you would be facing a long sentence.'","Daniel Lovick, 27, became abusive when his girlfriend fell pregnant .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . A woman in Florida has launched a campaign to get a stretch of Jacksonville Beach’s coastline designated as a nudist zone. Angela Anderson, 19, started the petition for the naked sunbathing zone on campaigning website Change.org. In the . petition, Ms Anderson appeals to Jackson Beach Mayor Charlie Latham to . designate around one quarter of the U.S. city's coastline as . ‘clothing optional’. Making waves: Jacksonville Beach boasts around four miles of sandy beaches and Ms Anderson wants the mayor to devote one mile of this to nudist sunbathers . The online petition needs 2,500 signatures and has so far attracted over 1,700. On Change.org's website, Ms Anderson writes: ‘The practice of nudism is purposely nonsexual. It serves as a personal comfort and a stronger sense of freedom. 'There is the belief that nudism helps with self-esteem, relaxation, and overall well-being.’ Jacksonville Beach city boasts around four miles of sandy beaches and Ms Anderson wants the mayor to devote one mile of this to nudist sunbathers, leaving over three miles as ‘clothing required’. Daring to bare: Haulover Beach is the only beach in Florida where nude sunbathing is officially allowed . ‘In this we give way for everyone to go to the beach however they choose', she explains. 'As many will want to go to a clothing-required beach, they will definitely have the choice within more than 3.1 miles of land, not to mention Neptune Beach and other surrounding beaches as well; and for those who recommend clothing optional, they may now have the option also.’ Haulover Beach is currently the only . beach in Florida where nude sunbathing is officially allowed but . sunbathers dare to bare on several other beaches in the Sunshine State, including Apollo . Beach, Playalinda Beach and Hobe Sound beach. Ms Anderson now plans to hold a naked photo shoot to publicise her petition and says she will post the images on a Facebook page dedicated to the campaign called The Nudement. But she said she has struggled to find somewhere she could carry out the shoot legally. No tan lines here: Angela Anderson wants Jacksonville Beach sunbathers to be able to go skinny dipping as they do on Haulover Beach . She told WJCT News: ‘It’s out of the way a little bit because it was hard to find someone with a big enough yard and on private land.' But Mr Latham dismissed the idea in an interview with News4jax.com: ‘Quite frankly, it's contrary to the objectives of creating a family-friendly Jacksonville Beach. ‘My recommendation to anyone who would do that is to find some private property somewhere where you can do that.’ He referred to the fact that there were several topless and nude beaches in Europe and said that American sailors looked forward to visiting them. But when they got there they discovered not models but members of the general public, aged from six to 60, which he said was 'not quite as pleasant as you might think'.","Angela Anderson, 19, started the campaign on Change.org .

"By . David Mccormack . and Zoe Szathmary . The transgender woman held as a sex slave in rural Louisiana for two years had been branded by her captors with a bar code tattoo and registered on a website as their property, investigators have revealed. The woman, who hasn’t been named, was found with a logging chain wrapped around her on the side of a highway in Natchitoches Parish last week. According to authorities, the Minnesota woman had been branded on the back of her neck by her captors - David Rodriguez Jr., 37, and his wife Christina Harper, 39 - not long after she had moved in with them. Scroll down for video . The transgender woman held as a sex slave in rural Louisiana for two years had been branded by her captors - David Rodriguez Jr., left, and his wife Christina Harper, right - with a bar code tattoo, investigators have revealed . Greg Dunn, chief investigator for the Natchitoches Parish Sheriff’s Office said the tattoo was the couple's way of staking the victim as their property. ‘Then with your iPhone, you scan the bar code and it shows on the website that [the woman] is registered with Rodriguez and Harper,' Dunn told the Star Tribune. Also arrested was Ambre Tubbs Lomas, 39, of Shreveport, suspected joining in with Rodriguez and Harper of abusing the woman. The defendants 'actually believe that their lifestyle is normal, just like our lifestyle is normal,' Dunn added. Also arrested was Ambre Tubbs Lomas, 39, of Shreveport, suspected joining in with Rodriguez and Harper of abusing the woman . 'They see no remorse… and they believe we don’t understand them. They are very comfortable and confident that they are doing the right thing.' Rodriguez and Harper have each been charged with human trafficking, aggravated second-degree battery, second-degree kidnapping/false imprisonment and offenses against computer users. They and Lomas remained jailed on Monday. Bond was set for Rodriguez and Harper at $635,000 each. Lomas was charged with second-degree kidnapping/false imprisonment and aggravated second-degree battery. Her bond was set at $525,000. Rodriguez has a criminal history, Dunn said, but ‘not anything like these charges.’ He said there’s no criminal history discovered for Harper or Lomas. The woman met her captors on a BDSM website and decided to move from her home in Minnesota to live with them. Digital connection: Rodriguez and Harper reportedly met the victim online through a BDSM website . Though Rodriguez allegedly helped her move in, she told police she was forced to give him her money and her Harley Davidson motorcycle. Authorities say she was forced to sleep in a 3-by-5 wooden box. 'In this particular case, the victim probably had some depression, going through the sex change, being disowned by her family,' said Natchitoches Parish Sheriff's Office criminal investigator Carey Etheredge. 'Suspects prey on people in this situation. They know how to talk to them, what to say to them to make them feel comfortable and make them think they’re coming to live a different life.' The woman was forced to perform sex acts, along with serving food and beverages, completing yardwork and working on a swimming pool, she told police. If she refused, Rodriguez, Harper and Lomas allegedly beat her and carved markings into her body, police said. The trio also allegedly tazed her and threw urine on her. Suspects: Couple Christina Harper and David Rodriguez, pictured, reportedly kept a woman as a sex slave in their home and abused her . Evidence: Authorities recovered multiple firearms and digital equipment when they executed a search warrant on the couple's home . Police have said that the relationship was consensual at one point, but they do not know which acts the victim was forced into. When the woman said she wanted to leave, 'they chained her outside for two days and nights, nude, in the woods - no food, no water,' detective Tim Key said. 'And then she was put in a storage building in the yard.' She escaped and drove one of the suspects' cars before she approached the assistant town marshal. The victim remains in protective custody at an undisclosed location in Louisiana, and 'we are providing services to assist her,' Dunn added. 'She will be taken care of, with psychological help as well as other needs to get her back on her feet.' Deputies recovered 15 guns, a stun gun, and digital equipment when they searched the home on Wednesday. Alleged suspect: Ambre Lomas, pictured dressed as a nun, is currently being held, along with Rodriguez and Harper . Tormentors? Rodriguez, seen here with Harper, allegedly tattooed the victim and listed her as a slave on a website . Two teenage children, aged 15 and 16, were also removed from the home and placed in child protective services. They are Harper’s children from a relationship before Rodriguez. Harper's Facebook page has several Bit Strip animated memes that appear to show her and Lomas abusing their victim. One shows Harper whipping the victim and comes with the tag that the victim 'thinks Christina is a real slave driver.' Harper and Lomas' social media profiles include jokey Bitstrips memes with the women as cartoon characters, and include references to beatings, whippings and death. Multiple images, some of which were uploaded by their alleged victim, show the woman as the recipient of abuse. Cruel humor: Harper, right, is depicted as 'a real slave-driver' abusing the victim, whose identity has been withheld . Macabre: Another meme appeared online showing Lomas apparently trying to hide Harper's dead body in a wooden box...not unlike the 3-by-5-foot box their alleged victim slept in . Harper is referred to as 'a real slave-driver' as she whips the woman in a cartoon while dressed as an Egyptian pharaoh. Another image shows her stuck in a fiery pit as Satan looks on. Other memes show Lomas and Harper apparently abusing one another. One image shows Lomas as a circus master getting ready to whip Harper, as if she is an animal performing. The caption reads 'Ambre ties to tame the wild Christina.' A different meme shows Lomas trying to stuff an apparently dead Harper into a trunk. Lomas' Facebook page also shows an interest in Gothic music and rock. She uploaded photos of herself dressed as a nun with heavy eyeliner when she reportedly attended a concert for Gothic metal band Ghost last month.

"By . Associated Press . A toddler vacationing with his family in San Francisco was tragically killed on Friday when a 6-foot-tall dolphin statue fell on him outside a Fisherman's Wharf store. The killed 2-year-old has been identified as Kayson Shleton of Draper, Utah who was in town with five of his vacationing relatives. Police say Kayson ran up to the illegally placed dolphin statue outside Majestic Collection Art Gallery around 11:30am, stepped on the base and wrapped his arms around the statue before it toppled over and crushed him. The boy's six-year-old sister tried to protect her brother and stop the statue from falling, but the object was too heavy. It's not known how much the statue weighed. Scroll down for video . Freak accident: Kayson Shelton, 2, of Draper, Utah, died on Friday after a dolphin statue placed outside of a store in San Francisco fell on him . 'He wanted to go up and touch it,' Kayson's father Scott Shelton told NBC Bay Area in a telephone interview Monday, 'and he stepped with a foot on the base of it and the statue came down on top of him.' 'I think any 2-year-old would go towards anything like that,' Mr Shelton added. Apparently the dolphin statue was so heavy that Shelton needed help to lift it off his son. 'He had a bloody nose at first, which stopped,' he said to Deseret News, 'and we thought he was going to be OK.' Moments later the boy passed out and was rushed to hospital where doctors were unable to save him. Kayson's uncle Sam Delahunty called the toddler's death 'a tragedy.' 'This is something that the family is reeling over,' Delahunty said to the Deseret News. Scott Shelton said that the sculpture was irresistible to his son. 'I think any 2-year-old would go toward anything like that,' he told NBC Bay Area. However, Delahunty said that the boys parents are not the type of people to 'point the finger'. Kayson was initially treated for just a bloody nose at the scene, but authorities say his condition worsened and he was taken to San Francisco General Hospital's emergency room where he died from serious internal injuries a few hours later. Tragic: Two dolphin statues can be seen outside the store on Google Streetview, though its uncertain whether either object was involved in Friday's incident. According to city code, no merchandise is allowed outside the Fisherman's Whaf store . Warned: Two-year-old Kayson Shelton was killed last week after a 6-foot-tall dolphin statue fell on him in the popular San Francisco tourist spot Fisherman's Wharf . Police spokesman Gordon Shyy called . Kayson's death 'an unfortunate and tragic incident,' especially . considering the dolphin statue shouldn't have been placed outside the . store to begin with. City code dictates that store objects or merchandise can't be placed on the sidewalk where it impedes pedestrian traffic. On . Jefferson Street, where the gallery has it's storefront, there's even a . blue line that dictates where those objects can be placed. But . in the case of Majestic Collection, that line goes all the way up to . their storefront, meaning it's against code to place anything outside . their business. And this isn't the first time that the store has gotten in trouble for their displays. Shyy says the store was advised on the city code last year, during the America's Cup -  a sailing race in San Francisco Bay. Another source with the Port of San Francisco anonymously told the San Francisco Gate that Majestic Collection was one of a few storekeepers that do not always comply with city code. 'For a couple of years now the merchants have been warned,' Capt David Lazar of Central Station added to the Gate. 'It is a violation of municipal police code.' Heartbroken family: Kayson and his mother Toni Shelton can be seen in this family photo posted to Facebook. The Sheltons have since returned home to Utah. A family friend has set up a fundraising page to help raise money to cover funeral costs . Storekeepers in Fisherman's Wharf were also recently sent a letter by the neighborhood merchants' association reminding them of the city code to keep displays behind the blue line. Dangerous: Kayson's father Scott Shelton, a podiatrist (pictured), told a local news station that 'any 2-year-old would go towards' the statue . The Special Victims Unit will be reviewing surveillance footage to see how the incident played out, McFadden said. The Sheltons were visiting San Francisco with relatives and were staying at a hotel near where the incident occurred. They have since returned to Utah. A YouCaring fundraising page has been set up to help parents Scott and Toni Shelton cover the young boy's funeral costs. As of Monday evening, it had raised nearly $17,780, which is more than its $15,000 goal. 'Our hearts have all been saddened to hear of the passing of Kayson Shelton,' fund organizer Brittny Hansen wrote on the page. 'His bright, enthusiastic way of embracing life was a light to all those who had the privilege of knowing him. 'The last words he said in this life were ""I love you"", and we sure love him as well.  He will be greatly missed but we are so grateful for the knowledge that families are eternal and that we will see him again.'","The 2-year-old has been identified as Kayson Shelton of Draper, Utah .

"By . Claire Bates . The World Health Organisation has come under pressure from campaigners to stop classifying transsexualism as a mental illness. The body publishes an international classification of diseases which informs government policy and health provision, but is currently under review. Now, more than 35,000 people have signed a petition at Change.org calling on the body to change its definition. It was set up by Max Zachs, 26, from London, who was featured on Channel 4's show 'My Transsexual Summer.' Scroll down to see advert from group supporting petition . Max Zachs was born a woman but began the process of changing his gender in 2009. He has set up a petition calling on WHO to stop classifying transexualism as a mental illness . Mr Zachs was born female but has been transitioning since 2009 when he took testosterone hormones. In 2010 he travelled to Bangkok, Thailand, to undergo a double mastectomy and male chest contouring. In a Youtube video to promote his campaign, Mr Zachs said: 'I am not sick. I am perfectly healthy. I am transgender.' Gender identity and its role in healthcare has long been the subject of heated debate. Homosexuality was removed from the list of mental disorders in 1990, when the ICD was last revised and advocates want transsexualism to be removed when it is updated in 2015. Transsexuals have a strong and constant desire to live and be accepted as a member of the opposite sex. Many have gender reassignment treatment to make their appearance more consistent with their preferred gender. This often involves hormone therapy and surgery. WHO listed homosexuality as a mental illness until 1990. Transsexualism is still classified as a mental disorder . Recent research suggests gender dysphoria could be caused by hormones not working properly within the womb. Sarah Savage, from Jersey, who went through transition last year, and appeared in the same documentary as Mr Zachs, said she found the current classification insulting. 'Before I can get to an NHS identity clinic, I have to be certified by a psychiatrist as sane,' she told Channel 4 News. Nottingham provides the only gender identity clinic in the UK that doesn't require a referral from a mental health expert. Ms Savage said the condition should be reclassified as a birth defect, as taking it off the list of conditions could lead to it being ignored by doctors. It is hoped changing the classification could encourage a more patient-led approach to treatment. Mr Zachs wrote on his blog: 'Petitioning the WHO to remove trans people from the list of mental illnesses is about wanting to change the way medical professionals think about trans people. 'It is about saying we have the same rights as any other person, we are not mentally deficient, we are able to make sane sensible decisions about our lives, there is nothing deficient about our minds and the only way to 'cure' transsexuality is for our society to give up its illogical and unscientific attachment to gender binary.' There are signs that a shift of opinion is occurring in favour of reclassification. In February, 2010, France became the first country to remove transgender identity from the category of mental diseases. Then last year, the European parliament adopted a resolution calling on WHO to change its definition of transsexualism. A WHO spokesperson said the ICD list had to reflect the demands and requirements of the 194 member states.","WHO currently defines transsexualism as a mental disorder .

"By . Associated Press . and James Rush . A 15-year-old boy has been charged with shooting a seven-month pregnant teenager who lost her unborn son following the attack last month. Eric Taylor, of Duquesne, Pennsylvania, was arrested yesterday in connection with the shooting of 15-year-old DaRae Delgado. The teenager was gunned down by someone who knocked on the door of her family's home and then opened fire on the expecting mother after covering the peephole with their hand. Eric Taylor, of Duquesne, Pennsylvania, was arrested yesterday in connection with the shooting last month . DaRae Delgado, 15, lost her unborn baby boy when she was shot four times, including twice in the stomach . The teenager's baby boy, who she planned to call Darren, died after an emergency C-section but Delgado is expected to survive. Taylor is now facing criminal homicide and other charges in connection with the shooting. Delgado's mother told local media that she knows Taylor's family and is shocked. Authorities say Taylor will be charged as an adult. He was being held in the Allegheny County Jail on charges related to another shooting at the time of his arrest. No attorney was listed on court papers. A hearing is scheduled for June 18. Tragedy unfolded at around 12.35am on Monday, May 26, when someone knocked on the door of the Delgado family's home in Duquesne. Motherhood: Relatives say despite her young age, Delgado was excited to welcome her son into the world . Tragic loss: Delgado was planning to name her son, seen here in a March ultrasound, Darren . DaRae, who goes by nickname the 'Cara' on Facebook, opened the door and was shot four times, including twice in the stomach. The gunman then fled the scene on foot. Deanna Weems, the victim’s mother, said she heard her son call out his sister's name after shots rang out and ran to the foyer, where she found the 15-year-old girl laying on her side and bleeding profusely. The mother-to-be was rushed to UPMC Mercy Hospital, where doctors attempted to save her baby, but to no avail. Relatives said despite her young age, DaRae was excited about becoming a mother. The baby's teenage father, Donald Crawford, was devastated by their loss. ‘I never got to feel him grip my hand, never got to hear him cry,’ Crawford told KDKA.","Eric Taylor arrested yesterday in connection with last month's shooting .

"By . Leon Watson . A family dog mauled its owners' two-month-old baby to death after attacking the boy while he was in his uncle's arms. Authorities in south-eastern Michigan said the dog, a Catahoula hound,  jumped on the family's couch and tore into the boy's head and throat. The attack happened late on Sunday morning at a home in Springfield Township, about 30 miles north-west of Detroit. Police were called to a house in south-eastern Michigan after a dog mauled a two-month-old baby boy to death . The dog was a three-year-old female Catahoula hound (similar to the one pictured) that the family had owned for about two years . The child's 18-year-old uncle was holding the baby on the couch at the time. He pushed the dog off, but it jumped back on and attacked the boy again, sheriff Michael Bouchard told WDIV-TV. There was no negligence by the adults involved, who had no reason to think the dog would attack the baby unprovoked, Bouchard added. 'It just turned and grabbed the baby,' the sheriff said. 'Who knows how much of this is instinctual, who knows how much territorial?' The infant's 26-year-old father was injured while prying open the dog's jaws, Bouchard said. 'He did everything he could to get the dog off of the baby, so much so that he's going to need stitches in his arms,' Bouchard said. Springfield Township's Sheriff Mike Bouchard said the dog jumped on the couch and tore into the boy's head and throat . The boy was taken to Genesys Regional Medical Center before being airlifted to William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, where he died, authorities said. 'This is a tragic incident, and it is a sad reminder to keep animals away from small children and babies no matter what the circumstances may be,' the sheriff told the station. 'Animal behavior, whether intended as playful or territorial, can have devastating impact on small children.' MailOnline has tried to contact the sheriff's office for more details. Authorities said they planned to euthanize the dog, a three-year-old female Catahoula hound that the family had owned for about two years. Several months ago the dog bit a neighbor but didn't draw blood, it was reported. The dogs can reach weights between 40 and 90lbs. The breed, named after Louisiana's Catahoula Parish, traditionally has been used in boar hunting.

"By . Richard Spillett . A UK oil and gas company has abandoned exploration in Africa's oldest national park after it came under intense pressure from conservationists. London-based exploration company Soco International is ending its operations in the Virunga National Park, in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), which is home to critically endangered mountain gorillas. The move, which comes after a sustained campaign by environmentalists to stop oil exploration in the World Heritage site, was hailed as a 'victory for our planet' by wildlife charity WWF. More than 700,000 people signed a petition to protect the Virunga park (pictured) from oil exploration . The company yesterday committed not to commission any exploratory or drilling within the park unless World Heritage body Unesco and the DRC government agreed to back such activities. It has also committed to staying out of other World Heritage sites. The company will end operations after completing a survey of Lake Edward, which is due to conclude shortly, it said. The national park is made up of lakes, savannah, forests, volcanoes and is home to rare wildlife including the critically endangered mountain gorilla, but 85 per cent of the park has been allocated to oil concessions. Unesco has called for the oil exploration permits to be cancelled and for energy companies not to drill in World Heritage sites. The park is home to around half of the world's 950 remaining mountain gorillas . David Nussbaum, chief executive of WWF-UK, said: 'Today is a victory for our planet. Congolese people around Virunga were joined by scientists and lawyers, activists and artists, governments, investors and WWF supporters worldwide to remove the immediate threat of oil exploration. 'Now is the time for the government of the DRC to reaffirm its conviction that Virunga has outstanding universal value for all humanity - by cancelling all oil concessions which overlap the park, as requested by Unesco.' WWF had filed a complaint against Soco under the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) guidelines for multinational enterprises and tyesterday's statement followed mediation between the two parties under the process. Ed Story, chief executive of Soco, said: 'Today's public commitment adds further definition and transparency to the company's approach regarding Virunga National Park and other World Heritage sites.' Sir Richard Branson (left) and Archbishop Desmond Tutu (right) had joined a campaign to protect the area . Mr Story added: 'Hopefully we can all get back to activities focused on both people and the environment where it does the most good for a place that we think can have a better future.' The licence did not include the mountainous sector of the park, which is home to the mountain gorillas, and the company had already stated it would never seek to have operations in the gorilla habitat, the Virunga volcanoes or rainforest. But WWF warned that the work could still damage wildlife, and lead to oil spills, pipeline leaks and gas flaring which could contaminate air, water and soil in the local environment. The environmental campaign was backed by businessman Sir Richard Branson, Archbishop Desmond Tuti and the British government. It was also feared development of oil resources in the troubled region could fuel further conflict, as minerals form the main source of export revenue and could be targeted by rebels for finance.","London-based firm Soco was allowed to look for oil in Virunga National Park .

"By . Chris Pleasance . A teenager received 23 stitches after being bitten in an apparent shark attack in Delaware. Andrew Vance, 16, from Laurel, Delaware, was attacked while he swam in five feet of water in Cape Henlopen State Park on Monday. Posting grisly pictures of the wound on his Facebook page, the teenager said: 'I am the boy that got bit, I'm fine just got out of the hospital. 23 stitches guys and boy did it hurt.' Andrew Vance, 16, posted this grisly snap on his Facebook page after being bitten in an apparent shark attack . Biologists think Vance was bitten by a four foot long sandbar shark, which are common to Delaware waters . Vance told park authorities that he felt something grab his left forearm while standing in the water, splashing and skimming his arms over the surface. The teen said he batted at the mystery attacker with his right arm, at which point it let go and swam away. He suffered gashes on his left forearm which were first treated by lifeguards at the scene, before he was taken to the Beebe Medical Center for further treatment. According to biologists, the cuts to his left arm were most likely caused by a juvenile sandbar shark, roughly three or four foot long. Any bigger and the injuries would have been more severe. Vance's right arm also suffered abrasions, which could be caused by hitting the shark's rough skin. Beaches at Cape Henlopen State Park were closed while officials hunted for the shark, but were reopened at 1pm after no further sightings were reported . The beaches at Cape Henlopen were closed while park officials watched the waters for any more signs of the shark, but reopened at 1pm after no further sightings were reported. Sharks are common in Delaware's waters at this time of year as numbers swell following the breeding season, but attacks are rare as they depend on fish for most of their food. Since 1940, there have been just three other shark attacks in Delaware waters, according to the database at the University of Florida.","Andrew Vance, 16, felt something grab his left arm while swimming in sea .

"By . Joshua Gardner . A set of twins in Boston has beaten all odds by being born 24 days apart in a rare, lifesaving delayed delivery procedure. Lindalva Pinheiro da Silva has spoken out about the technique doctors resorted to in the hope they could save one twin when the first was born at only 24 weeks after she went into premature labor in February. Miraculously, both twins managed to survive and, despite one being nearly a month older than the other, are recovering well. Delighted: Lindalva Pinheiro da Silva (pictured with her husband, Ronaldo, and twin babies) was just 24 weeks pregnant when she went into labor. Her twins beat all odds by being born 24 days apart in a rare procedure . 'Miracle babies': Da Silva has spoken out about the technique doctors resorted to in the hope they could save one twin when the first was born at only 24 weeks after she went into premature labor in February . Twins: The delighted mother says her babies will be able go home on June 18, their original due date . 'One twin was born in winter, and one was born in spring,' da Silva, 35, gushed to the Boston Globe. Alexandre and Ronaldo were to be her first children with Ronaldo Antunes, 40, and she was thrilled to be pregnant with twins. But when her water broke in February, the excitement turned to fear. 'I panicked,' da Silva told ABC. 'It wasn’t time. It was too early. I knew I could lose the babies.' Around 50 percent of babies born at the 24 week mark don't survive. Fighters: Miraculously, both twins managed to survive and, despite one being older, they are recovering well . Scary odds: Da Silva's first twin Alexandre was born at just 24 weeks and weighed only 1 pound 10 ounces. He had a 50 percent chance of survival . When potassium sulfate injections failed to stop da Silva's labor, doctors decided to go forward with a rare technique in which one baby is kept in the womb after its twin is born. 'When you have a situation where one baby is born and labor stops, you are given this window of opportunity,’ Dr. Steven Ralston, director of Maternal-Fetal Medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, told the Globe. 'But it’s a rare window. Most times, labor does not stop.’ Thankfully, after Alexendre was born at just 1 pound, 10 ounces, it did happen. Doctors stopped da Silva's labor and left the delivered child's umbillical cord and placenta inside da Silva's womb. Nearly a month apart: As Alexendre fought for his life, his brother Ronaldo lived on in their mother's womb growing stronger. Ronaldo was born 24 days after his brother and weighed 3 pounds 3 ounces . Wonder twins: 'Ronaldo because he stayed inside, and Alexandre because he's a survivor,' said da Silva . 'On the . second day after Alexandre was born, his umbilical cord came out,' da . Silva told ABC. Her husband Ronaldo 'saw it hanging.' 'But they just cleaned it and put it back inside,' she said. Da . Silva was given antibiotics to combat infection, which can be common . after the procedure. However, unlike many mothers, da Silva was . fortunate not to require her cervix to be stitched up to keep the baby . from coming. For the next three weeks, da Silva remained in the hospital, where she was able to visit Alexendre in the neonatal unit. 'I would sing to him and touch him,' she recalled to ABC. Then, 24 days after his brother was born, Ronaldo came at a much more robust 3 pounds, 3 ounces. 'That time made a crazy difference,' da Silva said of the three-plus weeks between births. 'He was born like a regular baby. He didn’t need a breathing tube or anything.' The boys remain in the hospital growing stronger. Now they each weigh over six pounds each. Doctors say they'll likly be able to go home by their original due date of June 18. 'They’re my miracle babies,' gushed da Silva. 'Ronaldo because he stayed inside, and Alexandre because he’s a survivor.'

"By . Meghan Keneally . Billionaire T. Boone Pickens has challenged Barack Obama to beef up his workout with some cardio after surreptitiously-filmed footage of the President working out was released earlier this week. The wealthy 86-year-old, whose net worth Forbes estimates to be around $1.2billion, has previously donated extensively to conservative causes but has taken an activist role in alternative energy sources in recent years. 'I challenge Pres @BarackObama to a 1 hr workout.  My cardio is better. Will work out energy plan for America #nosweat,' he wrote in a Tweet with a video attached that shows him running up a hill in San Francisco. Workout face off: T. Boone Pickens posted a video of himself running up a hill in San Francisco (left) as part of a jab at President Obama for not including cardio as part of his workout (right) Taking it to the tweets: Pickens is an advocate for renewable energy and he played that into his playful post . Pickens was a vocal critic of John Kerry when he was the Democratic nominee for president in 2008 but the two have since joined forces in 2010 on an energy plan backed by then-Senator Kerry and other Democrats. The bill has since been dubbed the Pickens Plan and calls for greater use of natural gas and wind power in order to relieve some of America's dependence on foreign oil. Poking fun: The 86-year-old billionaire is known to enjoy his Twitter feed . This is not the first time that the octogenarian has used Twitter to call out a formidable foe. In 2012, Pickens caused a stir when he started a playful war of words with Canadian rapper Drake. Drake posted a tweet in May 2012 writing: 'The first million is the hardest' and Pickens came up with a pithy response. 'The first billion is a helluva lot harder,' he wrote back. Drake accepted the proverbial hat that Pickens had handed back to him, writing '@boonepickens just stunted on me heavy'.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Victims of the payment protection insurance mis-selling scandal could have been under-compensated by up to £1billion, it has been claimed. Any affected customers would have had PPI on credit cards issued by Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, MBNA and Capital One, according to an investigation. The estimated shortfall relates to fees and charges attached to the mis-sold policies which have been left out of compensation calculations. Lloyds Banking Group said: 'When a customer lets us know that they may have incurred other costs because of their PPI policy, we will investigate and make an appropriate refund' Because these sums involve adding interest, the final amount customers received was dramatically reduced, the BBC investigation said. Independent financial consultant Cliff D’Arcy estimated that banks could have to pay  out ‘somewhere in the region of a billion pounds of extra compensation’. His calculation was based on factors such as typical penalty charges on credit cards, how many credit card users had PPI, how many of those paid charges and what interest they had to pay. Barclays acknowledged it has previously operated a month-by-month assessment of whether PPI premiums had triggered additional fees, which met the requirements of the regulations and was independently assured . MBNA said: 'We are confident that our redress is correct, we have considered our methodology carefully and in detail. Our confidence is reinforced through external independent reviews' The investigation said that in February, one PPI victim called Mark Pascoe was paid £5,800 in compensation by MBNA. However, the lender’s calculations did not include more than £600 in fees and charges Mr Pascoe had incurred since taking out his card in 1997. According to the claims management company advising Mr Pascoe, had those fees been correctly included in the calculations, his compensation payout would have more than doubled to more than £13,000. Experts advised customers concerned they might have been shortchanged to get in touch with their bank. According to estimates by consumer group Which?, the total amount put aside by banks to compensate PPI victims has reached £22.4billion. Such policies were frequently added to loans or credit cards without customers’ knowledge, or without them fully understanding what it was or whether they needed it in the first place. Lloyds Banking Group said: ‘When a customer lets us know that they may have incurred other costs because of their PPI policy, we will investigate and make an appropriate refund.’ Barclays acknowledged it has previously operated a month-by-month assessment of whether PPI premiums had triggered additional fees, which met the requirements of the regulations and was independently assured. Barclays told the BBC that it is now introducing an ‘enhanced’ method. MBNA said: ‘We are confident that our redress is correct, we have considered our methodology carefully and in detail. Our confidence is reinforced through external independent reviews.’ Capital One said: ‘We aim to pay redress that puts the customer back in the position they would have been in if they had not had PPI.’","Banks did not repay charges and fees associated with PPI .

"By . Associated Press . and Zoe Szathmary . A Washington teenager was on the phone with her mother as she hiked alone on a mountain in Alaska, saying she was nervous about the slippery terrain before her mother heard a scream, and then silence. The 18-year-old had fallen 30 feet from a cliff. The mother, Shelly LaGrou, said Tuesday that she waited, roughly 1,500 miles away in Omak, Washington, to hear her daughter's voice again. 'This was the first time she went hiking alone,' mother Shelly LaGrou told the Omak-Okanogan County Chronicle. 'She hikes several times a week with friends, but they were all at work. She wanted to go see some waterfalls.' Rescued: Cherelle LaGrou fell off a cliff while speaking to her mother on her phone . Survivor: LaGrou was saved by park troopers - and the dramatic rescue was captured by the National Geographic show 'Alaskan State Troopers' 'She was on the phone before this happened to her,' Shelly LaGrou told the Chronicle. 'We were on the phone together when the ground went out from under her. 'She was hysterical and did not know what happened. I calmed her down.' 'I'm still living it,' she told The Associated Press in a phone interview. Daughter Cherelle LaGrou, who is working in Alaska this summer, came back on the phone after a while, saying she had slipped down the slope and couldn't climb back up. She was hysterical and crying, telling her mother she wasn't ready to die. 'I am not sure what she found to get a finger hold to stop herself in the slide,' Shelly LaGrou told the Chronicle. 'She had her feet against the rock wall, which was a rock surface. It was rocky, icy down below.' Shelly LaGrou tried to keep her daughter calm Sunday while her husband frantically called the teen's employer, Denali Princess Wilderness Lodge, which alerted Alaska State Troopers. That call set in motion a dramatic 45-minute rescue near Denali National Park that was captured by the National Geographic Channel reality show 'Alaska State Troopers.' It's expected to air this fall. The teen said that before her rescue, she believed she was staring death in the face and thought about everything she would miss in her life. Instead, she sustained only minor scratches. Saved: Cherelle LaGrou, pictured, believed she was staring death in the face and thought about everything she would miss in her life after she fell . Park: The rescue took place in the Denali National Park . 'It feels like it was something out of a movie,' she said, laughing when reminded that in a way, it was. 'It was all just so unreal that it was actually happening.' Shelly and Cherelle LaGrou were talking for about 15 minutes before the teen fell from a ridge atop Fox Creek. The mother suggested Cherelle tuck her phone away to free both hands. The teenager did that, listening to her mother with a headset. She told her mother she had reached the edge of the mountain and didn't know what to do. Then came the scream. When the teen came back on the phone, she was hysterical and said her feet kept slipping. In that position, there was no way she could have called for help herself, Cherelle LaGrou said. Minor: Cherelle LeGrou sustained only minor scratches from the incident . Mother and daughter prayed together that angels would hold the teenager against the wall of the mountain. Soon after troopers arrived, Cherelle LaGrou's phone went dead. After the teen was safely on the ground, officials called her parents. While she waited to hear from rescuers, Shelly LaGrou didn't know they had secured her daughter with a rope. All she knew was that her daughter had been getting weary of trying to hold on. 'I knew that just one wrong slip any second, and I'd be hearing her scream again and she'd be gone,' she said.","Cherelle LaGrou, 18, was on the phone with her mother as she hiked alone on a mountain in Denali National Park saying she was nervous about the terrain -- right before she fell 30 feet from a cliff .

Firework celebrations broke out among his supporters as figures released by Egypt's Election Commission confirmed Sisi would become Egypt's next president, despite a disappointingly low turnout of just 47.5 per cent. Anwar el-Assi, the Election Commission's president, said the former field marshal received 23.78million votes. His sole rival, leftist politician Hamdeen Sabahi, got 3 per cent of the vote.

Anwar el-Assi, the Election Commission's president, said the former field marshal received 23.78million votes . After the announcement, several thousand people who were gathered in Cairo's Tahrir Square set off fireworks, cheered and sang pro-military songs. Sisi's victory was never in doubt, but the career infantry officer had pushed for a massive turnout to give legitimacy to the coup he led last July to overthrow former president Mohammed Morsi. The ensuing crackdown on Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood effectively outlawed Egypt's main opposition party. Some of Sisi's critics have argued that the turnout figure had been inflated after many polling stations appeared to remain largely empty throughout last week's election. The lack of participation was despite authorities threats that non-voters could face large fines, the introduction of a last-minute public holiday and the extension of polling to a third day. Morsi was elected in 2012 in an internationally supervised election that drew 52 per cent of Egypt's voters to the polls, but lasted less than a year in office until demonstrations prompted the military to remove him from power.

When officers arrived at the home, Layne says they found human remains on the grounds. They then questioned Hale and took him into custody. The victim has been identified as 36-year-old Lisa Hyder, from Dekalb County. 'We are very early in the investigation,' said Assistant District Attorney Marla Holloway. 'The officers were out late last night into the early hours of the morning gathering information.' Layne says Hale has an attorney and is being held in jail on $1.5million bond. His next court date is June 23. Detectives believe the gruesome murder took place inside Hale's rural home on Pete Sain Road in Manchester on or around Friday. According to Hale's arrest affidavit, the suspect admitted to killing Lisa Hyder and then disposing of her body by beheading the victim and chopping off her hands and feet.

"By . Associated Press . The Obama administration only finalized the exchange of Bowe Bergdahl for five Taliban detainees one day before the swap took place, a top Democrat has revealed today. Senator Dick Durbin said Tuesday that American officials didn't learn the pickup location for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl until an hour ahead of time. Senator Durbin, the Senate's No. 2-ranked Democrat, presented the timeline as an explanation for why President Barack Obama didn't inform Congress 30 days before the May 31 prisoner trade. Republicans and some Democrats have sharply criticized the president for failing to notify them and contend he broke the law. Obama says he acted legally. Scroll down for video . Released: Top lawmakers have revealed that they were only informed about the deal to exchange Bowe Bergdahl for five Taliban detainees one hour before it happened because of safety concerns . 'They knew a day ahead of time the . transfer was going to take place… They knew an hour ahead of time where . it was going to take place,' Durbin told reporters in the Capitol, where . military officials briefed the Senate Armed Services Committee behind . closed doors. Durbin spoke as a House panel overwhelmingly backed a measure barring U.S. funds for the transfer of detainees from the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, amid the congressional outcry over the swap. Timing: President Obama has stood by his decision to approve the exchange and said that the quick window was necessary to ensure the safety of both Bergdahl and the American soldiers transporting him . ‘The reason for that is simple, this is a secret military mission in which disclosure of the mission could put into jeopardy not just the life of Mr Bergdahl but also the lives of the military,’ incoming White House press secretary John Earnest said Tuesday. On a bipartisan 33-13 vote, the Appropriations Committee added the provision to a $570billion defense spending bill that blocks money if the administration fails to notify Congress within 30 days of a transfer from Guantanamo as required by law. The administration exchanged Bergdahl, who was the last remaining U.S. prisoner of war in Afghanistan held captive by the Taliban since 2009, for five Taliban officials who had been at Guantanamo for more than a decade. The five were sent to Qatar, where they are to remain for a year as part of the deal. Representative . Rodney Frelinghuysen, the Republican chairman of the defense . subcommittee, described the agreement as a 'violation of trust' by the . Obama administration that cannot be overlooked. The . measure also bars 85 per cent of the money in the account for overseas . conflicts until Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel reassures Congress that no . funds will be spent to violate current law requiring congressional . notification. House Speaker . John Boehner lamented Tuesday that although he was briefed on the . super-secret mission to take out Osama Bin Laden in 2011, he was kept in . the dark about the prisoner agreement with the Taliban. Although Boehner and other lawmakers voiced concerns when told more than two years ago about the possibility of the trade, the Ohio Republican told reporters he 'was never briefed on any specific negotiation.' In the week since the deal, lawmakers have raised questions about whether Bergdahl was a deserter and whether the United States gave up too much for his freedom. The exchange: The House Armed Services Committee was briefed on the exchange (pictured) today . Many members of Congress have cited intelligence suggesting the high-level Taliban officials could return to the Afghanistan battlefield. Particularly galling for lawmakers was a detail that emerged in a closed-door briefing Monday night with administration officials that 80 to 90 members of the U.S. government knew of the swap but not a single member of Congress. Republican Representative Howard 'Buck' McKeon, who serves as the House Armed Services Committee chairman, announced after the briefing that he'd investigate the deal. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel will testify before the panel Wednesday. No such probe is occurring in the Democrat-led Senate, but Republican Representative Jeff Sessions demanded similar open hearings. 'It's got to be demoralizing for our allies. It's got to be demoralizing for our soldiers. It's got to embolden the people we're fighting against. We're at war,' Sessions told reporters. Defending the administration's conduct, Durbin blasted his colleagues in Congress for focusing on the lack of notification, even if one of the loudest critics has been a party colleague: Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, who heads the Senate Intelligence Committee. Defense: Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein has said that she agreed that it would be impractical to expect the President to give a month's notice before the exchange . Looking for the next step: Republican Representative Howard 'Buck' McKeon (right), who serves as the House Armed Services Committee chairman, announced after the briefing that he'd investigate the deal . 'Are we saying that once we decided to do the prisoner transfer, we had to notify Congress and wait 30 days?' Durbin asked. 'The president couldn't do that. It was impossible. It could have endangered the man's life by waiting 30 days.' The law on notification 'doesn't square with reality,' he added. Durbin said he expected public doubts to subside as people learn more about Bergdahl's experience. 'As people understand the circumstances of his imprisonment, it will help explain why the president considered this such a threat,' Durbin said. He expected Bergdahl to offer his account publicly as well, although military officials are 'a little bit tentative because of his medical condition' right now and because declassification procedures are under way. 'As soon as he's in good shape and stabilized, he can tell us a little bit more about his experience,' the senator said.","House Armed Services Committee has been briefed about the deal and learned that top officers only heard about the deal one day before .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Scientists and legal experts have raised concerns that an ambitious experiment using a super-charged ion collider could accidentally destroy planet Earth. One of the world’s most powerful particle accelerators, which is capable of generating particles hotter than four trillion degrees Celsius, has come under the spotlight after experts have warned that micro black holes and strange matter could be generated. The Brookhaven National Laboratory’s Realistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) accelerates nuclei to the speed of light, before smashing them together in a bid to create quark-gluon plasma, which is an incredibly hot substance thought to have occurred just after the Big Bang. Scroll down for video . Scientists and legal experts have raised concerns that an ambitious experiment at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, using a super-charged ion collider, could accidentally destroy planet Earth (illustrated) While the experiment could help to answer questions about how life started on Earth, critics, including the Astronomer Royal, have warned that subatomic particles called ‘strangelets’ could be created accidentally . These particles have the potential to start a chain reaction and change everything into ‘strange matter,’ which Martin Rees said could transform Earth into ‘an inert hyperdense sphere about one hundred metres across’. The RHIC – the world’s second most powerful particle accelerator after Cern’s Large hadron Collider (LHC) -  is about to get a massive upgrade to boost its power and push experiments into uncharted waters. The Brookhaven National Laboratory¿s Realistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) pictured, accelerates nuclei to the speed of light, before smashing them together in a bid to create quark-gluon plasma, which is an incredibly hot substances thought to have occurred just after the Big Bang . With the upgrade, the RHIC will be able to generate collisions 20 times stronger than when it was originally built, prompting legal experts to question whether the facility also needs to perform a more thorough risk assessment. Eric Johnson, Associate Professor of Law at the University of North Dakota and Michael Baram, Professor Emeritus at Boston University Law School wrote in a piece for the International Business Times that the facility should be re-evaluated for its potential to create a huge scale disaster that could wipe out life on Earth. Since the RHIC was built, scientists have discovered the Higgs boson as well as quark-gluon plasma, which is not like anything that humans have ever known. The two legal experts argue that same commission that has recently probed the cost of the U.S. Department of Energy’s labs, should also ‘take a sober look at one experimental programme that raises a bizarre and little-discussed prospect of destroying the entire planet.’ The RHIC, the world's second most powerful particle accelerator after Cern's LHC,  is about to get a massive upgrade to boost its power and push experiments into uncharted waters. The Solenoidal Tracker at RHIC (STAR) - a detector that tracks the particles produced by each ion collision - is pictured . Scientists are worried that micro black holes and ‘strangelets’ could be created. Strangelets are a hypothetical form of quark matter that in specific conditions could trigger a chain reaction to convert everything else to strange matter and destroy the planet. Professors Baram and Johnson are particularly concerned that low energy experiments could boost the risk of creating strangelets and a recent report has shown that mini black holes can be generated from less energy than originally thought. There were similar concerns when Cern’s LHC began its quest to find the ‘God particle,’ even though it is unlikely that stable black holes can be created by particle accelerators and even if they were, they could not suck in matter in a way that could threaten the planet, iO9 reported. Two legal experts have called for a risk assessment to look into the risks of producing catestrophic chain reactions at national laboratories, including Brookhaven. The PHENIX detector at the RHIC is pictured. It records many different particles emerging from RHIC collisions, including quark-containing particles called hadrons . Where there were a number of reports investigating the chances of a catastrophic chain reaction arising from experiments, the legal duo pointed out that they were published more than six years ago and things have changes since then. Professors Baram and Johnson wrote: ‘The original [RHIC] report assumed the RHIC would only run for a planned 10 years. But thanks to program extensions, the RHIC is now entering its 15th year. ‘The machine has also been continuously upgraded since the report...The suitability of models and assumptions used in the original analysis might be profitably reappraised.’ They have called for 'rigorous, independent risk analysis it [the RHIC] has long warranted.’ In August 2012 physicists at CERN's Large Hadron Collider broke a record by achieving the hottest man-made temperatures ever - 100,000 times hotter than the interior of the Sun. Scientists there collided lead ions to create a searingly hot sub-atomic soup known as quark-gluon plasma at about 5.5trillion degrees Celsius, the hottest temperature ever recorded in an experiment. It was about 40 per cent hotter than the old record, set by the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory, New York, by smashing gold ions together. Scientists believe that at the point in our universe's history quarks and gluons – basic building blocks of matter – were not confined inside composite particles such as protons and neutrons, as they are today. Instead, they moved freely in a state of matter known as 'quark–gluon plasma'. Collisions of lead ions in the LHC, the world’s most powerful particle accelerator, recreate for a fleeting moment conditions similar to those of the early universe. By examining a billion or so of these collisions, the experiments were able to make more precise measurements of the properties of matter under these extreme conditions.","Brookhaven National Laboratory’s Realistic Heavy Ion Collider is due to get an upgrade and experts think it should have a risk assessment overhaul .

"By . Jenny Hope And Matthew Mckew . Women carrying devastating inherited conditions yesterday backed the Government’s approval of DNA treatment to create babies with three genetic parents – a technique that could let them have healthy children. Ministers say they will publish draft regulations for Britain to become the first country legalising the controversial IVF procedure, although it will be up to MPs to vote them in. The move has sparked an ethical debate, with desperate women who could benefit calling for an urgent change in the law. Sharon's son Edward Bernardi died last week at the age of 21, after battling the rare hereditary condition Leigh's Disease since the age of four (pictured aged one with his mother) However, some groups fear the technology could lead to designer babies. But Sharon Bernardi, who has lost seven children, said: ‘We are not changing the colour of eyes and we are not choosing to have boys and girls, we just want a baby to be healthy and survive, that’s all.’ Rachel Kean, who risks giving any future children Melas disease, which affects the brain, nervous system and muscles, said: ‘To have the option of knowing that your child could live a life free of these devastating diseases and live without this cruel life is something incredible.’ The technique involves replacing defective DNA in the mother’s egg with material from a donor egg. The resulting healthy child would therefore have genetic material from three parents – two mothers and a father. For the first time the so-called ‘germ line’ of inherited DNA from the mother would be altered which, critics say, would mark a turning point in the ethics of reproductive technology. Sharon (pictured with son Edward) has lost seven children and believes that the procedure would help babies survive . Professor Dame Sally Davies, the Government’s chief medical officer, said the ban on tinkering with the fundamental DNA that determines an person’s make-up, such as facial features and eye colour, will not change. But taking a snippet of DNA during the proposed process was more like replacing a defective ‘battery pack’ in human cells, she said. Rachel Kean said that the option to know your children could survive would be priceless . It would affect a tiny amount of DNA in mitochondria – the tiny powerhouses inside cells that turn food into energy – which is only passed down by the mother. Mothers with certain defective DNA can pass on mitochondrial diseases. If MPs approve the regulations, the first patients could be assessed and approved for treatment in 2015. It is expected that up to ten healthy babies with three parents each could be born every year to couples who might otherwise face the heartbreak of seeing them severely disabled and dying young. Sir John Tooke, president of the Academy of Medical Sciences, said: ‘The Academy is delighted that the Department of Health is taking steps to ensure techniques which could reduce the number of children born with rare mitochondrial diseases can move closer to being used in the clinic.’ Sharmila Nebhrajani, chief of the Association of Medical Research Charities, said: ‘Mitochondrial diseases are some of the most debilitating inherited conditions, for which there are few therapies and no cures. ‘Acknowledging the need for treatments to be proven safe and effective and for the public to feel comfortable with the implications is important, but that caution must not prevent us taking bold steps in the adoption of such potentially life-saving advances.’ But Helen Watt, of the Anscombe Bioethics Centre in Oxford, said the procedure would deliberately create an embryo for ‘spare parts’, adding: ‘Parenthood is about unconditional welcome of children, not manufacture and control. Couples who do not want to take the risk of passing on mitochondrial disease might want to consider ethical alternatives like adoption.’ Dr David King, director of Human Genetics Alert, said: ‘It is a disaster that the decision to cross the line that will eventually lead to a eugenic designer baby market should be taken on the basis of a biased and inadequate consultation.’ The experience of losing seven children left Sharon Bernardi devastated. Six died within four days of being born after suffering from diseases caused by defects in her mitochondrial DNA. Mrs Bernardi, 46, from Sunderland, and her husband Neil believe the new preventative technology is ‘the best way forward’. She believes it ‘would have made a huge difference’ to her life and helped with her desperate hope for a healthy child. She said: ‘It’s quite hard to keep going and trying, but I had to.’ When her son Edward survived his first week, she dared to hope things would be better. But at four and half he was diagnosed with Leigh’s disease, a result of mutations within mitochondrial DNA that affect the brain and nervous system. Edward confounded doctors’ predictions that he would live only a few months and reached his 21st birthday before dying. Mrs Bernardi said: ‘Edward was my life. You live with that pain every day.’ For Rachel Kean, the risk of passing on defective DNA and the possibility of having severely disabled children is a real fear. Miss Kean, 24, is having tests to see if she has Melas disease, caused defective mitochondrial DNA. Her mother is a carrier and it led to the death of her maternal aunt. Miss Kean, from London, said: ‘This is not about eugenics. We are talking about preventing life-threatening diseases.’","Ministers say they will publish draft regulations to legalise the technique .

The Utah woman accused of helping her white supremacist husband dump their teenage baby sitter in the woods wept as she pleaded guilty on Wednesday to desecration of a human body and other charges as part of a plea deal. Dea Millerberg, 41, whispered 'guilty' to three felony charges while crying in an Ogden court, The Standard-Examiner of Ogden reports. She also pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice and obtaining a prescription illegally.

Millerberg is scheduled to serve one to five years on each charge, with the time running concurrently, pending a judge's formal approval of the deal at a sentencing August 21. Dea Millerberg and her husband, Eric Millerberg, 38, had a drug-fueled, salacious sexual relationship with 16-year-old Alexis Rasmussen that led to her death from an overdose in 2011, prosecutors said. Eric Millerberg was found guilty by a jury in February of child-abuse homicide, unlawful sexual contact with a minor, obstruction of justice and desecration of a dead body. He was sentenced to up to life in prison - the maximum amount allowed under the state's guidelines. Weber County Attorney Dee Smith said Wednesday that he considered the plea bargain was a fair deal considering that Millerberg helped prosecutors get her husband convicted. During a three-day trial in February, prosecutors brought detectives, medical examiners, prisoners and Dea Millerberg to the stand to show that Eric Millerberg recklessly injected Rasmussen with lethal doses of heroin and methamphetamine during a night of sex and drugs. Tragic: Alexis Rasmussen, 16, reportedly asked the Millerbergs how to get meth and they started smoking the drug, along with heroin and marijuana, with the girl . Rasmussen had seven times the lethal amount of methamphetamine in her system and high levels of morphine and amphetamines, and that likely caused her death, a medical examiner said. Found: A full autopsy could not be performed because Alexis' body was so decomposed, but significant traces of heroin and meth were in her system . Prosecutors told jurors that Eric Millerberg and his wife then dumped Rasmussen's body in the woods of northern Utah while lying to police as the girl's mother desperately searched for her for more than a month. Eric Millerberg was sentenced to life in March for child abuse homicide - a first-degree felony and one to 15 years for obstructing justice, a second-degree felony. He was also sentenced to two terms of zero to five years for the unlawful and statutory rape of a 16-or-17-year-old - and abuse or desecration of a human body, third-degree felonies. The sentences are consecutive. On his part, Millerberg, 38, showed no sign of emotion as the judge sentenced him for killing  Lexi Rasmussen, 16, by injecting her with a lethal dose of drugs in September of 2011. Millerberg's wife Dea was also in the house at the same time getting high when Rasmussen fell unconscious and died. The two grabbed her body, stuffed it in to a trash bag, bundled it in the trunk of their car and dumped it in a remote rural location. Rasmussen was found 38 days later. Dea said the couple started using Alexis - or Lexi as she called her - as a babysitter for their two daughters in the spring of 2011. Dark side: During her testimony, Dea Millerberg . said that Alexis asked the couple if she could have sex with them in . August 2011- a month before she died- and also requested to be paid with . meth instead of cash . They became friends and started drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana with the teen before Alexis began requesting that they try harder drugs like methamphetamine and heroin. Eventually they began paying Alexis with meth. According to Salt Lake Tribune, Dea testified that on the night of the girl's death, she had picked up Alexis to baby sit her kids. She said as soon as Alexis arrived at the house, Eric Millerberg helped her get high by injecting her with drugs - once with heroin and twice with meth - into her arm and neck. Then, when she was ‘as high as she had ever been’, the girl and Eric Millerberg performed oral sex on one another. Dea said that she was not involved in the encounter. Disturbing: Eric Millerberg and Dea Millerberg divorced in 2012 after a 10-year marriage. They have two children together . Spot: The couple- along with their toddler- drove around extensively disposing of Alexis' body and all evidence. She was found here in Morgan County six weeks after her death . A short while later, the drugs had a negative effect on the teen and she started ‘freaking out’. She reportedly felt disoriented and cold, so she asked if she could take a warm bath in the couple’s master bathroom. After leaving her alone in the bath at her request, the Millerbergs checked on her about 45 minutes later to find that she was still cold, so Dea wrapped her in a blanket and told her to lie down in another bedroom. The couple left her to smoke cigarettes, and returned about a half hour later to find her unresponsive. ‘She wasn't breathing. She had mucousy stuff coming out of the right side of her mouth,’ said Dea, who was a licensed nurse and tried to resuscitate the girl to no avail. They then tried to figure out what to do next. Guilty: Eric Millerberg, 38, was found . guilty in February of child abuse homicide in the tragic 2011 death of his teenage . babysitter, Alexis Rasmussen . Scary and unkempt: Before his makeover, Eric Millerberg's Death tattoo on the . left side was visible and his beard was shaggy . ‘It really was a panic. The idea of it was, we will lose our kids and go to jail, and there was nothing we could do to bring her back,’ she told the court. Eric Millerberg was on parole at the time for burglary and firearm charges, and he was also known to be part of the Silent Aryan Warriors, a white supremacist prison gang. The girl was found with her legs folded against her in a fetal position, her lower half stuffed into a garbage bag. Utah assistant medical examiner Joseph White testified on Friday that the girl’s body was so badly decomposed, it was difficult to identify her. Dental records and a fingerprint analysis finally led to a positive identification. A toxicologist testified that reports showed she had ingested meth at least 24 hours before her death .","Dea Millerberg, 41, accepted a plea deal for her part in the death of Alexis Rasmussen, 16, in 2011 .

"By . Associated Press . Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told Congress Wednesday that officials of Qatar negotiating the release of captured Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl told the U.S. that 'time was not on our side' and a leak about the exchange would sabotage the deal. 'War is a dirty business, and we don’t like to deal with those realities, but realities they are,' he said. He revealed that the Defense Department had been evaluating different ways to retrieve Bergdahl for years, and at one point they were considering releasing six Taliban detainees but that fell through when one of the terrorists died. 'Since the time he went missing we've been looking for ways to get him back,' Hagel said this morning during a hearing on Capitol Hill. 'This was the best possibility to get him out because we were concerned that we might lose him.' Saying his part: Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel testified in front of the House Armed Services Committee Wednesday over questions about the prisoner swap that lead to the release of Bowe Bergdahl . Hagel testified at a House Armed . Services Committee hearing that the decision to transfer five Guantanamo . Bay, Cuba, detainees in exchange for Bergdahl was a tough call for . President Barack Obama. He . called the five men 'enemy belligerents' who had not been implicated in . any attacks against the U.S. and said that it was an 'extraordinary' situation. 'It was a very unique set of dynamics we were dealing with,' Hagel said. One of the most tense exchange came when Republican Congressman Jeff Miller from Florida asked why Sgt Bergdahl has not been returned to the U.S. and remains in Germany for his medical treatment. 'You’re trying to tell me that’s he’s being held in Landstuhl, Germany, because of his medical condition?' Miller said. 'Congressman, I hope you’re not implying anything other than that,' Hagel responded. Hagel also said that Qatar has . committed to adequate security measures that led him to decide the risks . of the transfer were substantially mitigated. Chairman . Buck McKeon set the tone for the tense exchange by accusing the White . House of breaking the law by failing to notify Congress 30 days before . the exchange took place. Hagel . tersely disagreed, saying that the Justice Department had given . reassurances that their actions- negotiating with the Taliban via Qatari . leaders for the prisoner exchange that led to the release of Bergdahl- . did not break the law. 'I . know that trust has been broken. I know you have questions... I’ll tell . you something else, I have always been straightforward, completely . transparent with this committee. I will continue to do that,' Hagel said . in his opening statements. 'That’s what I always demanded of any administration when I was a member of the U.S. Senate. I’ve been on your side. Tense: Hagel said that it was important for all of the military service members serving across the globe to see that the U.S. will make every effort to rescue them if anything were to happen . 'The circumstances were imperfect, but you have to make a choice, you have to make a decision.' One such decision was agreeing to release Taliban leaders, who Hagel said 'are bad guys, there's no question that they're bad guys, of course they are'. 'I . know that trust has been broken' -Chuck Hagel, to the House Armed Services Committee . Other questions centered on whether Bergdahl deserted and whether the U.S. gave up too much for his freedom. Administration officials have told Congress that four of the five Taliban officials will likely rejoin the fight. 'This prisoner exchange was done legally,' Hagel told lawmakers. Rear Adm. John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman, said in advance of the hearing that Hagel was set to explain why the decision to make the trade was 'the right one.' Kirby said the administration had a 'very small, fleeting opportunity' to secure Bergdahl's release and seized the opportunity, he said. Kirby's description of a small window for the agreement meshed with comments by Senator Dick Durbin, a Democrat, who told reporters Tuesday that the administration finalized the exchange only a day before it took place on May 31. The release: Army Sgt Bowe Bergdahl is now in the custody of the American government after being exchanged for five Taliban terror leaders . Durbin, the Senate's No. 2-ranked Democrat, also said American officials didn't learn the pickup location for Bergdahl until an hour ahead of time, making the question of advance notification irrelevant. Critics in Congress weren't convinced: in a bipartisan 33-13 vote, the House Appropriations Committee on Wednesday added a provision to a $570billion defense spending bill that barred money for the transfer of future detainees from Guantanamo. It also withholds other funds from the Defense Department until Hagel assures lawmakers that notification rules will be respected. 'We don't negotiate with terrorists,' House Speaker John Boehner said Tuesday. 'We've made America less safe, here and around the world. And we're going to pay for this.' Although Boehner and other lawmakers voiced concerns when told more than two years ago about the possibility of the trade, the Republican told reporters he 'was never briefed on any specific negotiation.' Obama is 'not going to get away with this one,' Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, a Republican, said after a closed-doors hearing of the House on Monday. He described the president's attitude as an 'arrogant thumbing of his nose' at Congress. Bergdahl had been held captive since 2009 and the Taliban officials who were traded for his release had been at Guantanamo for more than a decade. Under the deal, they have to remain in Qatar for a year.

"By . Associated Press . A Denver, Colorado dispatcher has been fired after failing to relay key information to officers responding to a call from a woman who was killed 12 minutes into a 911 call. Police say the dispatcher didn't tell officers that the woman's husband was getting a gun from a safe. Kristine Kirk, a mother of three, was allegedly shot dead by her husband Richard while she was on the phone to 911 in April. Scroll down for video . Mother of three: Kristine Kirk was shot dead while she was on the phone to a 911 dispatcher who police say did not update them when Kirk's situation escalated . Public safety department spokeswoman Daelene Mix said Monday the dispatcher was fired Friday. The person was not identified. Police have said Kirk pleaded in the April 14 call for authorities to hurry and send officers because her husband had asked her to get a gun and shoot him. Kirk said Richard Kirk was hallucinating, after having marijuana-infused candy and possibly pain pills. When police finally arrived, officers discovered Kristine Kirk on a floor inside the home with a bullet wound to the head. She was pronounced dead at the scene. Avoidable: The dispatcher has now been fired from his or her position after police failed to initiate an emergency response to Kristine Kirk's phone call because they were unaware her husband had a gun .

The couple's children may have witnessed the crime. Police were seen escorting a little boy to a patrol car outside the home. In a May press conference, police said that while the dispatcher was documenting what Kris Kirk was telling her and entering the information into a computer, he or she was not providing verbal updates to officers but forwarding notes to officers' laptops. The dispatcher didn't provide police with a verbal update for 13 minutes. According to NBC 9 News, the community has criticized the 12 to 13 minutes response time it took officers to arrive at the Kirks' home. Charged: Richard Kirk has been charged with his wife's murder . However, the Denver Department of Public Safety found no wrongdoing on the part of responding officers. In a reports, the department wrote, 'the response of the patrol officers was found to be reasonable and appropriate, given the limited information that was aired by dispatch.' If the information had been relayed from the dispatcher to police verbally, an emergency response would have been prompted, but at the time, officers believed they were responding to a routine domestic call. Forty-seven year-old Richard Kirk has been charged with first-degree murder. He has not yet entered a plea. He had no prior criminal record.","A 911 dispatcher in Colorado has been fired following the death of a caller during an emergency call .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . A legal complaint has been made against a Washington DC bar after a homophobic slur was allegedly printed on a receipt. Bistro 18 in Adams Morgan is accused of discrimination after a transgender customer was handed a receipt with the words 'Gay b*****s' printed on it. Amira Gray, who visited the restaurant in August last year with a group of friends, said she humiliated by the way she had been treated by staff. Humiliated: Transgender woman Amira Gray claims bar staff at Bistro 18 printed a gay slur on her receipt . Ms Gray, a transgender woman, also claimed that wait staff at the bistro had treated her group differently to other customers. She said that although other groups were served at their table, Ms Gray and her friends had to order at the bar every time they wanted drinks, and that 'no wait staff approached our table'. When a waitress handed Ms Gray her check at the end of the night, the phrase 'Gay b*****s' had been printed at the top. 'As a transgender woman I was extremely hurt, embarrassed, and upset,' Ms Gray wrote in her statement on the legal complaint. 'I felt the slur was meant as a slap in the face because of my gender identity and expression ... and my friends who are or may have been perceived as being lesbian or gay.' Ms Gray said one of her friends confronted the manager about what had been printed on the receipt, but claimed the manager removed the check and printed a new one without the slur. Her friend had retained a copy of the original, which was released by transgender rights group Lambda Legal. Claims: A legal complaint has been made against Bistro 18 over allegations that it discriminated against customer Amira Gray . 'That this . happened in Washington, D.C., where LGBT people have strong protections . from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender . identity, and personal appearance, points out the importance of ensuring . existing laws are enforced,' Dru Levasseur, of Lambda Legal, said.

"By . Ashley Collman . Not on the list: Clearwater, Florida lawyer Denis deVlaming (picture) and his wife Voncele were banned from attending a close friend's wedding reception by the Church of Scientology . A well-known Clearwater, Florida couple was banned from attending a close family friend's wedding reception last weekend by the Church of Scientology. Jack Vasilaros secured the Crystal Ballroom at the church's Fort Harrison Hotel in downtown Clearwater for his daughter Marina's wedding reception, but was told he had to submit a guest list in advance. Last Thursday, Mr Vasilaros was informed by the church that friends Voncele and Denis deVlaming could not attend.Since it was just two days before the wedding, he did not object. 'They're great people,' Mr Vasilaros told the Tampa Bay Times. 'I love them. But it is what it is.' Mr deVlaming,  a local attorney, says he was shut out of the reception because of his work representing opponents of the church over the years. But he believes it's unfair that the church also banned his wife, who had nothing to do with his legal affairs. 'We were both very heartbroken,' Mrs Voncele said of not being able to attend the wedding. She says she has known Marina since she was just a baby, and was there when the bride went wedding dress shopping and to subsequent fittings. In a last ditch effort, Mr deVlaming tried petitioning the church to let his wife attend the reception by contacting a fellow lawyer, F. William Pope Jr, who has represented the Scientologists for years. But on Friday, Pope phoned back with bad news, leaving a voicemail saying: 'Denis, I'm sorry. I've done everything I can. They will not budge for you or your wife.' Marina Vasilaros and Louis Michaelos wedding reception was held at the church's Fort Harrison Hotel, and the church requires a guest list submitted in advance. The couple are Greek Orthodox and not affiliated with the church . Two days before the event, the church called to inform the father of the bride that the deVlamings could not enter the building. Mr deVlaming has previously represented opponents of the church in legal battles. Above, the ballroom where the reception was held . Mrs deVlaming instead attended the wedding ceremony Saturday afternoon at the Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church. At the end of the service, she was forced to explain to friends why she wouldn't be seeing them for dinner at the hotel.' 'They were just appalled,' she said. Her husband decided to opt out of the ceremony so as not to cause any tension. Mr deVlaming has represented opponents of the church since the 1990s, when he took on New Hampshire millionaire Robert Minton as a client - then the church's number one enemy.

Above, a picture of the wedding posted on the groom's Facebook . Minton moved to Clearwater, bought a building downtown and helped fund a group of church protesters. When Minton got into a fight with a church member outside the Fort Harrison Hotel, deVlaming represented him in court on misdemeanor batter charges. He also represented two other members of Minton's group who clashed with church operatives. 'I won all three,' Mr deVlaming said. 'And they (church leaders) don't like that.' Neither the bride, groom or their families are members of the church. Other than the deVlaming snub at the reception, the rest of the wedding went fine, Mr Vasilaros said.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The twin sister of Michael Rockefeller - who vanished in New Guinea in 1961 - has revealed that she was so devastated by his death that she saw his face in crowds for years afterwards. Mary Rockefeller Morgan, whose father was the governor of New York at the time her brother went missing, has spoken in depth for the first time about his death and how her wealthy family insisted she must never cry about it, even though she was heartbroken. The 76-year-old psychologist, who is based in New York and specializes in twin bereavement, also dismissed claims that her brother had been killed and eaten by cannibals and instead said she believes it is more likely that he drowned after he was stranded at sea. Heartbroken: Mary Rockefeller Morgan has spoken about how devastated she was when her twin brother Michael disappeared in New Guinea when they were 23 . 'There is no direct or conclusive evidence of how Michael died,' Mary, told People magazine. 'When you don't know how the person died, . it prolongs the grieving and the healing. There were times in my life . where I really couldn't function.' Michael, then 23 and the son off New York Governor and future Vice President Nelson A. Rockefeller, vanished off the coast of New Guinea on November 19, 1961. He was in the country as part of an anthropological expedition to collect art from the Asmat tribe, a remote group of people who welcomed and fascinated him, his sister said. Before he traveled there, Mary said she had a 'premonition' that he would not return. 'But there was no dissuading Michael,' she said. 'He was completely thrilled about what he was doing.' Mystery: Michael, 23, is pictured in New Guinea the year before he vanished. He was there studying tribe communities and their art when he vanished as he tried to swim to shore from a stranded boat . Lost: Michael, pictured in New Guinea, is thought to have drowned but some speculate he was killed and eaten . But in November 1961, he was aboard a catamaran with his companion and fellow researcher Rene Wassing when the vessel was swept out to sea. After . failing to paddle towards the shore and running out of food and water, . Michael - the only one of the pair who could swim - realized he had to swim to the shore. But he was never seen again. While it is largely believed that he failed to reach the shore - which he had estimated would take him about 10 hours - and drowned, others have speculated that he was eaten by the tribe. In a book, Savage Harvest, published in March, journalist Carl Hoffman wrote that extensive research had led him to believe that members of the Asmat tribe had found Michael swimming and killed him. Hoffman wrote that Michael was tortured, beheaded and eaten in a ritualistic cannibal killing by the tribe as revenge for the murder of five of their own by a Dutchman overseeing the colony. But Mary Rockefeller Morgan said she . thinks it is more likely that he drowned in the massive expanse of sea . rather than be killed by the people who had showed him such kindness. Family: Mary is pictured front row left with her father, New York Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller and his first wife, Mary. Right is her sister Anne and brothers Steven, Rodman and Michael are pictured top . She said she still remembers her father bringing her family the news - 'I knew deep down for one terrible moment that Michael was gone' - before they flew to New Guinea that night. Devastated: Mary has written about her grief in a book, which shows her and her brother . 'We were incredibly moved by the amount of people who came out over this vast expanse of jungle from their small villages and went to search for him,' she said. 'The prevailing thought was that he had drowned... In a seaplane over the dense jungle coastline, I realized how unbelievably difficult it was to make it to shore.' After ten days, the family called off the search and Mary returned home, where she hugged her mother, who told her never to cry. She saw this as part of her 'responsibility' as a Rockefeller. She buried her emotions and struggled with her grief. 'Nobody knows what happened to Michael, and that leaves our family in a terrible place of not knowing,' she said. I wanted him to be alive so much that sometimes I thought I saw him in a crowd.' She began speaking with a therapist but admits that it took her nearly 30 years to heal. She said she found her work with grieving twins helped her share her story. Now she remembers him happily, and regularly visits the art he collected that is on show at the Metropolitan Museum. 'Today he feels so present,' she said. 'He left for me his incredible curiosity and his ability to embrace life... He is bigger than his death. My family and I hold him in our hearts, and we are so proud of his legacy.'","Michael Rockefeller, the son of the then-New York governor, was on an anthropological mission in New Guinea when he vanished in 1961 .

"By . Associated Press . A 12-year-old girl accused of stabbing a friend in a quest to please a creepy fictional character called 'Slender Man' will have a mental evaluation, while an attorney for the second girl also charged in the crime said today that he could raise the issue of competency later. The girls, Morgan Geyser and Anissa Weier, both 12, appeared in court for a minutes-long hearing that would typically attract little attention but in this case drew dozens of journalists and others to Waukesha, a usually quiet community west of Milwaukee. The girls' families sat silently as a court commissioner agreed to appoint a doctor for Geyser and scheduled their next court dates for July 2. Geyser's father broke down in tears in the courtroom. Anissa Weier, aged 12, (pictured left) is charged along with alleged 12-year-old accomplice Morgan Geyser (right) of stabbing their friend 19 times in a Milwaukee wood as a sacrifice to impress the mythical online creature Slender Man . Home: The 12-year-old girl stabbed 19 times and left for dead as an offering to the mythic Slender Man is back home with her family recuperating . Geyser will undergo a mental competency test at the request of her attorney, a Waukesha County Circuit Court commissioner said. The attorney, Anthony Cotton, said the results of the evaluation, which must be completed within 15 days, will be sealed. Geyser’s father left . in tears and said nothing. Weier’s father said: 'No comment,' according to Fox. According to court documents, the girls plotted for months to kill their friend to curry favor with Slender Man, a character in horror stories they read online. They told investigators they believed Slender Man had a mansion in a Wisconsin forest and they planned to go live with him after the slaying. The Slender Man is a prevalent myth that has been a viral sensation since it emerged online in 2009 . One of the girls hosted the other two at a May 30 slumber party to celebrate her birthday. The next morning, the two girls attacked the victim in a wooded Waukesha park. One told investigators that she told the victim to lie down and be quiet after the stabbing so that she would lose blood slower. Weier's family said that the young girl  struggled to tell the difference between myth and reality . The girl said she hoped to convince the victim to be quiet so the victim would not draw attention to them and would die. Once the attackers left, the 12-year-old victim crawled from the woods to a road where a passing bicyclist found her. Doctors later told police the girl had narrowly escaped death because the knife missed a major artery near her heart by just one millimeter. The child was released from a hospital last week and is recovering at home. Police have not identified her, and her parents asked friends to keep her name secret. Anthony Cotton, the defense attorney for one of the girls, asked the Court Commissioner Laura Lau to have a doctor evaluate her to see if she was competent to stand trial. Lau agreed and ordered the doctor's report kept secret. 'We have an obligation to raise competency when we have reason to doubt it,' Cotton said afterward, adding that he couldn't go into detail. He said previously that he believed his client showed signs of mental illness. The other girl's attorney said he is not raising competency as an issue right now but could later. Public defender Joseph Smith Jr. said his focus now is getting information from prosecutors to help prepare for a preliminary hearing. Smith said he knew the victim's injuries were severe, and both he and Cotton apologized on behalf of the girls' families. 'I join my client and my client's family in wishing the victim a swift recovery,' Smith said. Cotton said his client's parents expressed remorse every time he spoke with them. 'This is a tragedy for everybody,' he said. The girls have been charged as adults . with first-degree attempted homicide and are being held at a juvenile . detention center on $500,000 cash bond. They face up to 65 years in . prison if convicted. Cotton declined to describe how his client was doing but said anyone incarcerated that young 'is going to have a hard time'. Weier, aged 12, (left) and Geyser (right) allegedly stabbed their 12-year-old friend in the woods and left her to die last month as a gift to mythical figure Slender Man . Weier and Geyser (pictured) would allegedly whisper about the plot to kill their schoolmate when they were on the bus . Wisconsin law requires prosecutors to charge children 10 and older as adults in severe cases. Public defender Samuel Benedict, who works with Smith, said they would try to have their client's case moved to juvenile court. Cotton also has said he would like his client's case transferred. The odds are against them, however. A 2013 review of the court system found that of approximately 240 people under 17 charged as adults in 2012, only seven had their cases moved to juvenile court, Wisconsin Supreme Court spokesman Tom Sheehan said. The court system does not track such cases statewide on an annual basis. Morgan's father, Matt (left), apparently knew of her interest in Slender Man and seemed amused by it, according to pictures he posted on his Instagram account .

"By . Snejana Farberov . Last Friday afternoon, Lisa Hyder, a mother of six, called her ex-husband shortly after meeting a stranger in a Tennessee liquor store who offered her a ride home. Just hours later, the 36-year-old woman was murdered, dismembered and partially cannibalized by suspected Satanist Gregory Scott Hale, according to police. Three days after Hale's arrest on charges of premeditated first-degree murder and abuse of a corpse, new shocking details are beginning to emerge about the case that left a small Tennessee community reeling. Scroll down for video . 'Cannibal': Gregory Hale (left), 37, has been charged with murder and abuse of corpse after police say he killed 36-year-old Lisa Hyder (right), chopped up her body and ate parts of the corpse . Site of grisly crime: Detectives believe the gruesome murder and cannibalism took place inside Hale's rural home on Pete Sain Road in Coffee County, Tennessee . According to Lisa Hyder's ex-husband, Charles Hyder, the mother of their six children had struggled with alcoholism and was recently diagnosed with ovarian cancer, WZTV reported. The woman lived in a Chattanooga suburb and worked in a store selling spirits in Manchester, where on Friday afternoon she ran into Gregory Hale. At around 2.30pm, she called her ex-husband asking to pick her up, but he said he was in another town. He told her to wait for him, but when Mr Hyder returned home two hours later and called Lisa back, her phone was not answering. Charles Hyder said he spent the weekend trying to reach his ex-wife so their children, the youngest of them just a year old, could talk to her like they did every day, but he could not get a hold of her. ‘I still blame myself because I didn't go get her, but I was down in Huntsville unloading my truck, and I wished I could have been there a little bit faster,’ Hyder said. ‘Usually I rescue her every time something goes wrong.’ Troubled: Hyder was a mother of six, the youngest only a year old, who had struggled with alcoholism and was recently diagnosed with ovarian cancer, which she refused to get treated . Fate: Hyder, 36, called her ex-husband asking for a ride home after meeting Hale, but the man was away in another town and could not pick her up until two hours later . The couple were married for six years before splitting last year. The mother of six had a longstanding problem with alcohol and refused to get treatment for her cancer. But Charles Hyder said no matter what she had done, he loved her. Lisa Hyder's family say they plan to push for a death penalty for her alleged killer. ‘My daughter was mangled, butchered and chopped up like a liver. There's nothing left,’ her heartbroken father, Billy Poore, told the station WAAY. A clearer picture also has begun to emerge of the suspected killer and cannibal, Gregory Hale. The 37-year-old was known among his neighbors and acquaintances as a devil worshiper. He was reportedly fired from a meat processing plant after the owner caught him performing a satanic ritual. Spine-chilling: Hale was fired from a slaughterhouse after the owner caught him performing satanic rituals and taking home animals' bones and eyeballs . Dangerous stranger: Hale, pictured here with a machete and glowing contact lenses, met his alleged victim in a liquor store and offered to give her a ride home, but instead took her to his house . The proprietor of the slaughterhouse recalled that Hale would often take animal bones and eyeballs home with him. His Facebook page is filled with disturbing, sexually explicit and grisly images, as well as references to cannibalism and Scandinavian mythology. 'Would tha vegetarian taste like that fake soy meat like they got in sum fast food places???' he wrote in April. According to his social media account, the 37-year-old has a girlfriend and a teenage son named after a Norse god. Some of Hale's selfies depict him brandishing weapons, including a large steel machete, or cradling snakes. The 37-year-old also shared an image that featured a line of text that read: 'I hug the people I hate so I know how big to dig their hole in my backyard.' Grisly details: Gregory Hale signed an affidavit admitting to beheading Lisa Hyder's corpse, chopping off her hands and feet, and burying her torso . The dark side: Hale's Facebook page is filled with unsettling, gruesome images and references to murder and cannibalism . Coffee County District . Attorney Mickey Layne said Hale was apprehended at his home late Sunday . after a neighbor told police he'd had a conversation with the . 37-year-old and had reason to believe a homicide had been committed. When . officers arrived at the home, Layne said they found human remains on . the grounds. They then questioned Hale and took him into custody. Hale has an attorney and is being held in jail on $1.5million bond. His next court date is June 23. Detectives believe the gruesome murder took place inside Hale's rural home on Pete Sain Road in Manchester Friday. According . to Hale's arrest affidavit, the suspect admitted to killing Lisa Hyder . and then disposing of her body by beheading the victim and chopping off . her hands and feet. Drastic change: At some point in his youth, Gregory Hale went from a clean-cut high school senior (left) to a practitioner of the occult obsessed with thrash metal music and Norse mythology . Officers who responded to Hale's residence after receiving a tip found at least two plastic buckets filled with human remains. Hale buried the victim's torso in a burn pile on his property and consumed a part of the corpse, the document stated. Following his arrest, Hale told police he and Hyder did not know each other until they met in Manchester and went to the man's home, Times Free Press reported. The two were sitting around the fire and talking when the 37-year-old allegedly attacked and killed Hyder. Gregory Hale offered investigators no motive for the brutal slaying and subsequent cannibalism.","Gregory Hale, 37, charged with first-degree murder and abuse of corpse in the death of Lisa Hyder .

"By . Associated Press . The search for a missing Alaska family of four has expanded to a densely wooded forest near a jail close to the family's home, but officials said there has been no information to lead them to look in any specific location. Crews are using a helicopter and all-terrain vehicles to search for Rebecca Adams, 22; her daughters, Michelle Hundley, 5, and Jarraca Hundley, 3; and Adams' boyfriend, Brandon Jividen, 37. Investigators also asked the public for information on the family missing for two weeks from their home in Kenai, about 65 miles southwest of Anchorage. A desperate search is underway for Michelle Hundley, five, (pictured left) and her sister, three-year-old Jaracca (right) who went missing from their Alaska home with their mother and her boyfriend last month . 'Don't assume information isn't worthwhile; we want to hear anything that may help,' Police Chief Gus Sandahl said. Adams last had contact with relatives May 27, the day after Memorial Day. The latest physical evidence of a sighting for Adams, Sandahl said, was an appearance with her children on a video surveillance recording May 18 at a Kenai business. Local police received a call . from a neighbor on May 31 who reported that a backyard shed door was . lying open at the family's home. Five . days later on June 5, the same neighbor contacted the police to report . that the family home appeared to have been lying empty for days. Lanell . Adams, who flew to Alaska from Washington state to look for her sister, . said: 'I've called dozens of times. I'm scared more than anything.' Rebecca Adams, 22, (left) vanished last month from her apartment in . Kenai along with her partner Brandon Jividen (right) and her two young . daughters . Adams said the last contact she had with her sister was distressing. The two women talked on the phone on Memorial Day weekend. 'She . sounded very distressed,' Lanell Adams said. 'She just told me: ''Know . that I love you,'' and she had to get off the phone very quickly.' 'Growing . up we always had this thing, we say 'Thou shall not lie' and you . always have to tell the truth,' Lanell Adams said. 'I asked her, ''Thou . shall not lie, Becca, are you ok?' She said, ''Don't ask me that right . now. Just know that I love you.' Police began investigating last weekend, and the FBI joined in the search. The family lives in a four-plex near the Wildwood Correction Facility, but they failed to pay rent this month. Residents tell the Peninsula Clarion the neighborhood is quiet but has a transitory nature. 'We don't know everybody in our building, much less buildings down the street,' said Amy Murrell-Haunold, who lives on the same street as the missing family. The FBI are looking for the two sisters who went missing with their mother and her partner in rural Alaska . Jeff Pfile and Anna Haave manage the building where the family has lived for two years. They said it was unusual for the Adams and Jividen to be late with a rent payment. 'If I felt they were going out of town I would have been the first person they called because they are so responsible (for paying their rent on time),' Haave said. 'For them to not say anything is not normal.' Police say vehicles belonging to Jividen and Adams remain parked at the four-plex, and their cellphones have been turned off. The family's brown and white English springer spaniel named Sparks also is missing. The father of her two girls, Jaramiah Hundley, died in a motorcycle crash in May 2012. Besides local police and the FBI, fire officials, canine units and wilderness search groups from across Alaska have been brought to Kenai to help search. Alaska State Troopers provided a helicopter to help search from the air, and police have used all-terrain vehicles on trails in woods near the home. The search area has expanded to areas north of the correctional facility. Dog teams . and helicopters have been drafted in to search the area surrounding . Kenai. On the lookout: A massive search for a family of four in Alaska is focusing on nearby woods and the behavior of one of the missing, a mother of two young children . The family disappeared from their home in Kenai, Alaska last month after relatives said that the mother, Rebecca Adams was showing signs of distress . Lt. David Cook told ABC: 'At this point it’s not apparent where . they have gone or where they might be. 'The investigation . does not show that is foul play at this point, but we are very deep into . the investigation of the missing persons.' Lt. Cook added: 'The family has expressed some concern . with the behavior of their sister Rebecca and have some concerns within . her relationship [to Brandon].' A Facebook group called Seeking . Alaska's Missing  shared a picture of the missing family and urged . anyone with information to contact the Kenai Police Department. The . poster claimed that the family went missing on May 27. Police say they receive new information about the missing family every day, but nothing that would lead to finding them or even a specific location to search. 'We remain optimistic we will be able to reunite them with their family,' Sandahl said. 'We want nothing more at this point and hope they are safe.' Family members have put up fliers of the missing family members in popular fishing areas the family frequented on the Kenai Peninsula, and police statewide have been alerted, Sandahl said. No detail about their possible whereabouts is insignificant, he said. Kenai, a rural fishing port in the Gulf of Alaska, has a population of around 7,000 people and is 160 miles from Anchorage.","Brandon .

"By . Lydia Warren . Arizona border patrol agents have seized a truck that looked identical to a 'U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service' vehicle - and found it was carrying $1.6 million worth of marijuana. The truck is just the latest example of a 'cloned' or faked vehicle used by drug smugglers to get illegal substances across the Mexican border into the U.S., authorities have revealed. Smugglers have used FedEx vans, AT&T service trucks, cloned police cars and even school buses to carry stashes of illegal drugs into the country, police in Texas told CBS. Scroll down for video . Stopped: Border patrol agents in Tuscon, Arizona followed this truck that looked like a 'U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service' vehicle last week - but found it had $1.6 million of marijuana inside . Last week, agents . spotted the white truck with official U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service decals . along a boundary fence in Douglas, Arizona, while responding . to reports of possible drug smuggling. When agents tried to contact . the driver, the truck suddenly stopped and two people fled into . Mexico. When . they opened up the truck, agents say they that they found 3,200 pounds . of marijuana stashed in bundles inside the vehicle's flatbed. Texas authorities said it is a trend they first noticed in 2007. The real deal: The truck's insignia (pictured) was a perfect copy - but when border control tried to contact the driver, two men jumped out of the car and fled back into Mexico . Discovery: Agents stand over a massive stash they found inside -  3,200 pounds of marijuana in bundles . A police . officer in George West, Texas, had attempted to pull over what looked . like a Texas Department of Transportation or 'Tex-Dot' truck. Officer Jorge . Medina said the vehicle looked 'just like a typical Tex-Dot truck, from the . exempt plates to the stickers, the insignia' - but he had noticed that the license plate belonged to a school district. Dash cam footage shows the officer pulling over the vehicle and approaching it - before it suddenly speeds off. He . chased the vehicle before the driver lost control and the truck spun . into an embankment - scattering bundles of marijuana across the road. Authorities said there was nearly a ton inside. Suspicious: The first case was in 2007 when an officer noticed that this vehicle looked like a a Texas Department of Transportation truck but had a license plate belonging to a school district . Oops: The officer took chase until the truck crashed - scattering nearly a ton of marijuana across the road . Creative: Smugglers have used DirectTV and AT&T trucks as well as police cars and school buses . Since that incident, law enforcement officials in south Texas have kept their eyes open for cloned vehicles, Sheriff T. Michael O'Connor in Victoria County said. 'If you can think of it and name it, we have stopped it,' O'Connor said. 'Some of them are excellent.' Others haven't been so good - including one truck with a sign spelled, 'Border Patron'. The ruse is just the latest way to get drugs across the border, with smugglers previously using catapults, tunnels and panga boats to get drugs over.

"By . Snejana Farberov . A New York healthcare firm is under fire for allegedly forcing employees to join prayer circles, thank God for having jobs and say 'I love you' to co-workers and managers. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed a discrimination lawsuit Wednesday against United Health Programs of America and its parent company, Cost Containment Group. The EEOC says the Long Island company required employees to practice a belief system called 'Harnessing Happiness' or 'Onionhead.' It includes praying, discussing personal matters with colleagues and reading spiritual texts. Under fire: The EEOC has sued Syosset-based United Health Programs of America owned by Cost Containment Group, claiming that staff have been forced to practice the Harnessing Happiness or Onionhead belief system . The agency says employees of the Syosset-based firm who objected were disciplined or terminated. Staffers were required to wear 'Onionhead' buttons to work; read spiritual texts; keep a dim lighting in the office and burn candles, the lawsuit stated. 'Onionhead' was created by a relative of the company owners, according to court filings. The EEOC stated the New-Age religious practices have been in place since 2007. ‘While religious or spiritual practices may indeed provide comfort and community to many people, it is critical to be aware that federal law prohibits employers from coercing employees to take part in them,’ Sunu Chandy, senior trial attorney for the EEOC, told Newsday. The Harnessing Happiness Foundation describes 'Onionhead' as a belief system that was created two decades ago by a mother and daughter to guide people to more harmonious and successful lives. 'Cult of happiness:' The Harnessing Happiness Foundation describes 'Onionhead' as a belief system that was created 20 years ago by a mother and daughter, who are reportedly related to the owner of the insurance company . Inappropriate: Staffers were required to tell one another and managers 'I love you,' and thank god for having jobs . The complaint against the Long Island-based insurance firm and its parent company was first brought by three former employees, according to New York Daily News. Elizabeth Ontaneda, Francine Pennisi and Faith Pabon allegedly had been demoted and later let go for refusing to attend meetings with Denali Jordan to discuss divine paths and moral codes. Jordan reportedly was in charge of enforcing 'Onionhead' practices in the workplace. After Pennisi publicly denounced 'Onionhead,' declaring that she was Catholic, the woman was ousted from her office and replaced with a statue of Buddha, according to the lawsuit. Ms Jordan reportedly attributed the woman's resistance to the 'Onionhead' way to demonic intervention. Fringe faith: Since 2007, company employees have been forced to wear 'Onionhead' buttons and read spiritual texts . Zen retaliation: When a staffer refused to discuss moral codes with a supervisor, she was allegedly banished from her office and replaced with a Buddha statue . The EEOC is asking a judge to stop the practices and ensure employees receive back pay and other compensation. Both Denali Jordan and United Health Programs of . America have denied the allegations laid out in the federal lawsuit, . deeming them without merit.","U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed discrimination lawsuit against United Health Programs of America and its parent company .

"By . Associated Press . Philippine army troops and police on Wednesday captured a top Filipino commander of the Abu Sayyaf extremist group who is on the U.S. list of most-wanted terrorists and has acknowledged receiving al-Qaida funds to finance bombings in the country. Philippine security officials said Khair Mundos was arrested in a slum community near Manila's international airport but it was not immediately clear why he was in the capital. The military and police have been hunting him for his alleged involvement in bombings and kidnappings. Khair Mundos, a top commander of the Abu Sayyaf extremist group who is on the U.S. list of most-wanted terrorists, is booked by police following his capture, in Manila, Philippines . Mundos is one of the highest-ranking terrorist suspects to be captured in the country in years. He was captured in 2004 but escaped in 2007. Military intelligence chief Maj. Gen. Eduardo Ano described Mundos' capture as a major blow to Abu Sayyaf, where he has served as a top commander, financial and logistical officer, trainer and planner of attacks. The U.S. State Department says Mundos, who also faces money laundering charges, has acknowledged that he arranged the transfer of al-Qaida funds to the Abu Sayyaf to finance bombings and other attacks in the Philippines. Members of the Abu Sayyaf extremist group have acknowledged receiving al-Qaida funds to finance local bombings . The State Department announced a $500,000 reward in 2009 for the killing or capture of Mundos. U.S. authorities said he has worked as a financier for Abu Sayyaf. He has led Abu Sayyaf militants on southern Basilan and is known to have links with members of the Southeast Asian militant network Jemaah Islamiyah. Abu Sayyaf, which has an estimated 300 armed fighters split into about six factions, has been blamed for deadly bomb attacks, ransom kidnappings and beheadings.

Cameron Read, 39, of Prescott Valley, was arrested last Friday on a slew of weapons charges after police say he discharged a handgun trying to hit the moon 238,900 miles away. Prescott Valley police responded to the man's home after a 49-year-old woman reported that her boyfriend had fired several round from a handgun and still was armed last Friday night. The unnamed girlfriend woman and her 15-year-old son told responding officers Read was talking about seeing Halley's Comet and fired a round out of the window. They heard several more shots before fleeing the residence in the 4400 block of Preston Drive. Read has been booked into the Yavapai County Jail on suspicion of felony counts of unlawful discharge of a firearm, resisting arrest, disorderly conduct and endangerment plus misdemeanor criminal damage.

"By . Snejana Farberov . 'Baby-faced killer': Marissa Williams, 19, has been charged with solicitation of murder for allegedly trying to hire her own aunt posing on Facebook as a boy to kill her family . A 19-year-old Alabama woman has been arrested for allegedly trying to hire her own aunt posing online as a man to kill her family and even their dog. Marissa Williams was charged Monday with solicitation of murder. She was being held in the Tuscaloosa County jail on $30,000 bond. Williams' aunt told authorities she created a Facebook profile for a fictional man, Tre 'Topdog' Ellis, to connect with her niece and chat with her after their relationship became strained. Williams moved in with her aunt and her family in April, but the two women were not on good terms. The aunt became angry with Ms Williams for constantly talking to strangers online and inviting them over to her home, where the woman lived with her fiance and son. In retaliation, the niece blocked her aunt on Facebook. In order to keep tabs on her niece's online activities, and also to teach her a lesson about the pitfalls of talking to strangers, the aunt came up with the character of 'Topdog' Ellis. Court records obtained by Al.com state that Ms Williams began chatting with the fictional man and confided in him that she was angry with her relatives. The 19-year-old also invited the bogus Facebook friend to her home to get drunk and offered to have sex with him if he agreed to pay her $50 cell phone bill. In late May, the unaware teenager asked Ellis to come and take her away, and to shoot her aunt if she tried to stop him. As the two continued exchanging messages online, Williams' alleged murder-for-hire plot became ever more elaborate and brutal. Documents indicate that the teenager instructed her aunt pretending to be a young man to enter the woman's bedroom and kill her and her fiance. Ms Williams also allegedly asked 'Topdog' to gun down her cousin and the family dog while she was busy loading her belongings into the getaway car. Williams' concerned aunt eventually contacted authorities for help. When deputies responded to the family’s home in Tuscaloosa and interviewed Williams, the teen confessed and apologized, but insisted that she did not really intend to have anyone killed.","Marissa Williams, 19, was angry with her relative for asking her to stop talking to strangers on Facebook and inviting them over .

"By . Francesca Chambers . The United States government is allegedly in negotiations with National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden, it was claimed Tuesday. Department of Justice officials and Snowden's legal representative recently met to discuss a plea deal that would allow Snowden to return to the U.S.,The Washington Free Beacon said in a report. Neither the Justice Department nor the lawyer the Free Beacon believes to be representing Snowden, Plato Cacheris, would confirm to the online news outlet that they had met to discuss Snowden, however. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . In his first interview with a U.S. TV . network since leaking information from the NSA, Edward Snowden told NBC News last month that he wants to leave Russia but the United States won't let him . 'It remains our position that Mr. Snowden should return to the United . States and face the charges filed against him,' Justice Department spokesman Marc Raimondi told the Free Beacon. 'If he does, he will be accorded full due process and protections.' 'There’s nothing to report,' Cacheris said. Snowden is currently living in Moscow, Russia under government supervision. The country gave him temporary asylum last year, but the one-year deal ends in August. The NSA leaker is in the process of reapplying for asylum in in Russia, however he has indicated that he does not want to stay there permanently. Snowden has made efforts to obtain permanent asylum in several European countries, as well as Brazil. 'If Brazil offered me asylum I would accept with pleasure,' Snowden reportedly told a Brazilian news outlet last month. 'I would very much like to live in . Brazil.' Last month Snowden told NBC News' Brian Williams that his original plan was to go to Latin America, but, ' I was stopped because the United States government decided to revoke my passport and trap me in Moscow Airport.' 'So when people ask, ""Why are you in Russia?"" I say, ""Please ask the State Department,"" ' Snowden told him. 'When people say, ""Why don’t you go home and face the music?"" I say, ""You . have to understand that the music is not an open court and a fair . trial,"" ' Snowden said. Secretary of State John Kerry said the following day that Snowden would come back if her were a 'patriot.' 'A . patriot would not run away. A patriot would stand up in . the United States and make his case to the American people,' Kerry told Today show host Savannah Gutherie. 'If he cares so much about America and he believes in America, he should trust the American system of justice,' Kerry said. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters the same day that Snowden 'faces felony charges here in the United States . and he ought to return here to face these charges. Less than a month ago Snowden told NBC News anchor Brian Williams he can't come home and 'face the music' because 'the music is not an open court and a fair trial' Snowden has been charged with three separate counts of espionage by the government, including theft of government documents. Officials familiar with Snowden's talks with federal prosecutors told the Free Beacon that the plea deal under discussion would require Snowden to hand over the documents he stole in exchange for a reduced sentence. Snowden has publicly said he destroyed the roughly 1.7 million documents, however. After making copies of NSA files at the facility he worked at in Hawaii, Snowden says he traveled to Hong Kong, where shared his information with reporters for the British news publication The Guardian. After his business in Hong Kong concluded last summer, Snowden says he got rid of the hard drives containing the documents before continuing on his journey to Latin America. Some U.S. officials suspect that Snowden still has the documents in his possession, however, and that he may have shared them with the Kremlin. Snowden has denied that he is working with the Russian government in any capacity, and NSA Director Michael Rogers told Bloomberg News in an interview last week that he believes him. Rogers said Snowden is 'probably' not a Russian spy, though it is possible. He also acknowledged that Snowden may no longer have the documents in his possession. Asked in the interview if he thinks the U.S. should consider dropping its charges against Snowden, Rogers said, 'That’s not my decision.'","The United States government has reportedly offered NSA leaker Edward Snowden a plea deal .

Chris added: 'It was great fun and gave us a welcome opportunity to get away from the computers we spend so much of our lives working at. 'The internet is redefining design, and there’s a real opportunity for visual content to flourish. 'There is no reason for infographics and web content to be made from clip art and stock images.

Argentina's players are now the subject of a FIFA investigation after making a political statement about the Falklands on Saturday night. The players unfurled a banner which said ‘Las Malvinas Son Argentinas’ (The Falklands are Argentine) before their friendly encounter with Slovenia at the weekend. The Malvinas is the Argentinian name for the Falkland Islands, the disputed South Atlantic archipelago that has been administered as a British territory since 1833. That prompted the Football Association to react by ordering England’s players not to respond to any media questions about the Falklands conflict. Scroll down for video . Making a statement: Argentina players unfurled a banner claiming the Falklands as theirs during a friendly with Solvenia in La Plata . Don't mention the... England's team have been warned against responding to questions about the Falklands . FIFA officials have confirmed that the action of the Argentina players is being reviewed by their disciplinary department. Once a statement has been cleared by FIFA’s legal department, a form of punishment is sure to follow. FIFA does not allow political messages during matches. Alejandro Sabella’s team's inflammatory banner was unfurled before its 2-0 friendly win over Slovenia. They will be fined by FIFA because political slogans are forbidden. Now the FA have banned England’s players from discussing the conflict. After England’s 0-0 draw with Honduras, the FA told every member of staff: ‘Don’t answer questions on (the) Falklands.’ Captain Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard and Rickie Lambert were the only three players in England’s squad who were born before the Falklands War in 1982 but Hodgson knows his history. 'Don't answer questions on Falklands' was written on the team board after England's game against Honduras . The Falklands War in 1982 saw 649 Argentinian military killed, along with 255 British military over 74 days. On Sunday, England were dealing with another matter after assistant manager Gary Neville was accused of telling a cameraman to ‘f*** off’ during a walk in Rio de Janeiro. According to FA sources, Neville finally snapped after being followed for around a mile by a persistent cameraman just hours after the England squad arrived in Brazil for the World Cup.

"By . Joshua Gardner . A veteran Marine and the brave dog that once accompanied him as he searched out and diffused IEDs in Afghanistan had an emotional reunion Thursday after four painful years apart. Corporal Jeff DeYoung never stopped being thankful to his black Labrador pal Cena even after they were separated suddenly and without getting to say goodbye in April 2010. Thanks to non-profit group Mission K9 Rescue, which works to make such reunions possible, the two old friends came together once again and Cena, who retired after six years of service, took her place in his growing family. Scroll down for video . Happy reunion: Four years after they were separated without getting to say goodbye, veteran Marine Corp Corporal Jeff DeYoung was reunited with the bomb-sniffing dog Cena who helped keep him and his fellow soldiers safe in Afghanistan . Since he was sent home in 2010, DeYoung has married and had two children. But the Muskegon, Michigan man never forgot the brave dog he'd bonded with at war. 'When he found the scent, he would lay down and would look at me,' DeYoung told ABC News. 'At that time, I knew within six feet of that area there was a bomb.' The highly trained, life-preserving purebred can sniff out some 300 kinds of explosives. But he had his protector, too. 'My main goal was to protect him,' DeYoung said. 'I remember we would get into firefights and having to cover myself on top of him so he wouldn’t get harm. It was all about him.' Long separation: DeYoung left for home in April 2010 and hadn't seen Cena since . DeYoung served in Afghanistan with Cena who was his contract working dog that specialized as a improvised explosive device detection search dog . 'My main goal was to protect him,' DeYoung said. 'I remember we would get into firefights and having to cover myself on top of him so he wouldn¿t get harm. It was all about him.' When DeYoung found out about Cena's impending retirement, he was connected with Mission K9 Rescue. The organization's president Kristen Maurer soon traveled from her home in Texas all the way to Raliegh-Durham International Airport on Thursday, where she picked up the pooch. Maurer then turned the car around and drove all the way to Detroit, where she'd make the reunion happen. 'The reunion was beautiful. They always are,'  Maurer told ABC News. 'Cena slammed her head into his chest once she realized who he was and she was so happy.' Here, DeYoung hugs Kristen Maurer of Houston, Texas who brought Cena, to be reunited with DeYoung.

"By . Neil Ashton . Follow @@neilashton_ . Roy Hodgson is sending an FA delegation to assess the state of the pitch in Manaus amid concerns about the poor surface quality. Pictures emerged on Wednesday of a poorly prepared surface inside the Arena da Amazonia ahead of England's opening group game there against Italy on Saturday. The grass isn't greener: England will open their World Cup campaign against Italy at the Amazonia Arena . Patches: The pitch appeared dry in places and was noticeably bare, just three days ahead of the Group D match . Running out of time! A lonely groundsman cuts te grass in the empty Arena da Amazonia stadium . Hoof and hope? The uneven pitch surface is unlikley to promote passing football for England's opener . It's not the Premier League! Weathered lines are clearly visible across the pitch in Manaus . Even the man in charge of Manaus's pitch admitted it was in 'bad shape'. Hodgson's squad make the four-hour journey by plane deep into the Amazon rainforest on Thursday and will not even practise at the FIFA-appointed training ground. Instead, the FA revealed that the team will work in the gym on Thursday afternoon before training in the stadium on Friday evening. England's advance party will check the condition of the pitch - in line with FIFA regulations - and report back to Hodgson at the team hotel. Carlos Botella, head groundsman for the Royal Verd company which is responsible for the turf at Manaus and six other World Cup stadiums, said: 'Frankly, Manaus is in bad shape. We've started to implement an emergency plan to try to save the field and improve it as much as possible, but I don't think it'll be in good condition by the weekend. We put fertilizer on and we'll increase the fertilizing process with biostimulants and seeds to try to get the most out of the grass.' On tack: Brazilian road builders work inside the stadium area of the Arena Amazonia in Manaus . England vs Italy - Group D - June 14 . Cameroon vs Croatia - Group A - June 18 . United States vs Portugal - Group G - June 22 . Honduras vs Switzerland - Group E - June 25 . England players have so far insisted they are not concerned about the quality of the pitch, but behind the scenes there are genuine reservations about what they are likely to face. Hodgson is also waiting on positive news for Danny Welbeck after he was forced to miss training yesterday with a strained muscle in his right leg. The England forward limped out of training on Tuesday and was forced to miss the entire session at their Urac military training centre on Wednesday. Instead, he worked with physio Gary Lewin but will travel with the rest of the squad to Manaus after a scan revealed there is no serious damage. On Wednesday, Hodgson juggled his team in training and played Raheem Sterling out on the left during a practice match. At this stage, it seems a straight fight between Welbeck and Sterling for the final spot in England's starting line up against Italy. That means Wayne Rooney is likely to start in his preferred No 10 role behind Daniel Sturridge with  Adam Lallana out on the right in a 4-2-3-1 formation.

"An 111-year-old from Japan has become the world's oldest man after the death of American Alexander Imich earlier this week. Mr Imich, formerly the world's oldest man, died on June 8 at his home in Manhattan, New York, US, aged 111. Now Sakari Momoi, who was born just one day after Mr Imich on February 5, 1903, has been awarded the title. Sakari Momoi, who was born on 5 February 1903 in Fukushima City, Japan, has been named as the world's oldest man, at age 111 . Great-grandfather Mr Momoi was born in Fukushima city and later moved to Saitama City, where he has spent his life serving his community. In July last year, Mr Momoi, who served as the Chamber of Commerce executive director in his home of Yono, became Japan's oldest living man, after the death of Jokichi Ikarashi, who was 111. He was today confirmed as the world's oldest man, after the death of Mr Imich, a retired chemist and parapsychologist, who had held the title since May 8. Karen Bogen, of Providence, the neice of Mr Imich, said she had visited her uncle the day before his death with her sister and several of his close friends. Mr Imich attributed his longevity to good genetics, proper nutrition and exercise and the fact that he and his wife did not have children, said Ms Bogen. Mr Momoi, pictured left, was given the title after the death of Alexander Imich, pictured right, formerly the world's oldest man, who died on June 8 at his home in Manhattan, New York, US, aged 111 . Michael Mannion, a longtime friend, . said Mr Imich's 'enormous curiosity and ability to turn even great . adversity into something positive were important factors in his long . life'. At . the age of 93, Mr Imich enrolled for three years at the IM School of . Healing Arts, a school that offers programmes in self-awareness and . hands-on healing, 'because he wanted to learn more about love', said Mr . Mannion. Mr Imich detailed the work of a Polish medium known as Matylda S in his book Incredible Tales Of The Paranormal, which was published in 1995 when he was 92. Mr Imich was born in 1903 in a town in Poland that was then part of Russia. He and his wife fled after the Nazis invaded in 1939. They moved to Connecticut, US in 1951. He then moved to New York after his wife's death in 1986. He began requiring round-the-clock help only in the last few months but declined markedly in the last two weeks, unable to recognise those around him, Ms Bogen said. Mr Imich listed some other possible reasons for his lifespan.They included not having children, participating in athletics, and abstaining from alcohol. Though Imich may have been the world's oldest living man, there are 66 women in the world older than him, according to the Gerontology Research Group's data. The world's oldest person is a woman, 116-year-old Misao Okawa, from Japan.","Sakari Momoi, from Japan, is named as the world's oldest man, aged 111 .

Families who urgently need a passport to go on holiday will have their applications fast-tracked for no extra cost, as ministers scrambled today to clear the 500,000 backlog. Home Secretary Theresa May also announced that people applying to renew their passports abroad to come back to the UK would be given an automatic 12-month extension. Those applying for passports overseas for their children would also be issued with emergency travel documents for travel to the UK - although they will still have to provide 'comprehensive proof' that they are the parents. Scroll down for video . Home Secretary Theresa May announced a raft of emergency measures today to tackle the 500,000 passport backlog . Queues outside the London passport office, as people frustrated at being unable to get through on the phone turn up in person instead . Mrs May has drafted in emergency staff to - earning up £70 an hour - to the Passport Office to clear the backlog. Around 100 Home Office staff based in the North have been asked to move to the Liverpool Passport Office for up to two months, a letter leaked to MailOnline revealed. This is on top of the 250 backroom staff at the Passport Office which have already been redeployed to the front line. But MPs have complained that even they have been unable to get through to jammed telephone lines to raise urgent cases. It emerged today that staff at the under-fire Passport Office have a ‘call-avoidance strategy’ when answering the phone to families worried they will miss their holidays. In a Commons statement this morning Mrs May attempted to contain growing public anger over the crisis. She told MPs: 'Where people have an urgent need to travel, HMPO has agreed to upgrade them - that is their application will be considered in full, it will be expedited in terms of it's processing, printing and delivery - free of charge.' The Home Secretary acknowledged the concerns of people waiting for passports so they could travel, but cautioned there was no 'big bang, single solution'. 'I understand their anxiety and the Government will do everything it can while maintaining the security of the passport to make sure that people get their passports in time,' she said. 'These changes will allow us to free up a significant number of trained HMPO officials to concentrate on other applications. In addition, HMPO will increase the number of examiners and call handlers by a further 200 staff.' Fed-up families left on hold to the Passport Office call centre have vented their frustration on social media . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg suggested that the surge in passport applications was become more people could now afford to go on holiday. Mr Clegg told LBC 97.3 radio: 'In one sense, it is a great thing that many, many more people appear to be planning to go away on holiday. 'Maybe that's a sign of people feeling that they have got a bit of extra money in their pocket and can afford to go on a summer holiday this year, the way they didn't last year.' He added: 'I have a lot of sympathy with people who have sent in their passports and are now worried about whether they are going to get them back in time to go on holiday.' Mr Clegg confirmed that he had checked that his own family's passports are up to date for a summer getaway. And he added: 'We must throw every single measure we can at this problem to make sure people's passports are returned quickly.' There's no crisis! Mr Cameron went on the defensive yesterday as thousands vented their anger . Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee, called for an emergency phone number to be set up to help people to get through. ‘This is an issue that concerns every constituency in the country,’ he told Sky News. ‘And so many examples of individual people who are facing great hardship as a result of this chaotic incompetence. ‘I met a man called Harry who told me that he had to go on holiday with his wife without his six-month-old child because the child's passport was not ready. ‘Now these are real-life examples and they just cannot be dismissed as not being important. ‘This is critically important to people at this time that they're able to get their passports, they've paid a fee and they want to get their passports.’ It emerged that the Passport Office’s call centres, run by private firm Teleperformance UK, has a plan to avoid members of the member who phone them. The company took over taking telephone enquiries in February in what could be a five-year contract. It includes managing 'contact centre services for general enquiries from the public regarding all passport applications including identity interviews for first time adult applications and Passport Validation Service for businesses'. In a press release trumpeting the deal in December, the company said it would ‘support HM Passport Office in both its Digital By Default and Call Avoidance strategies’. The revelation will infuriate people who have been left on hold while trying to track the progress of their passport application. Mr Cameron yesterday insisted there was no passports crisis despite admitting tens of thousands of travellers have been hit. At Prime Minister’s Questions, Mr Cameron said: ‘The Government has taken action to deal with this problem – not today, but in weeks gone past. ‘We have 250 staff already redeployed to the front line prioritising all outstanding applications, that will allow for an extra 25,000 examinations weekly.’ But Labour MP Geoffrey Robinson said: ‘We are told all is well and under control at the Passport Office, but staff are working a 17-hour day. They are being paid up to £70 an hour overtime for the high-level job of sticking on labels with names and addresses. ‘If that is not evidence of a crisis of mismanagement, I do not know what is.The Government appears to be ignorant of – or plain indifferent to – the problems.’ To add to the sense of chaos, the Home Office intervened to over-rule managers who tried to water down security checks to speed up processes. Staff were told in an internal memo to scrap checks on applicant's addresses, counter-signatories and employment details. But after fears were raised the secret changes could play into the hands of fraudsters, angry ministers moved to re-impose the checks. The memo, leaked to the Guardian, was issued to HM Passport Office staff in Liverpool, Durham and Belfast and instructed them to ease some checks in an attempt to speed up turnaround times. Exposed: Tens of thousands of applications were pictured stacked and waiting to be processed at the Liverpool passport office, one of seven around Britain. The picture was taken by a disillusioned staff member . Waiting game: Stacks of passport applications . wait to be processed in Liverpool,  and with passport staff struggling . to clear a backlog, holidaymakers and business travellers face losing . costly trips abroad . It allowed staff to drop checks on counter-signatories, as well as requirements for evidence of addresses and letters of confirmation from employers and accountants. The move sparked fears that identity thieves and fraudsters would be able to use stolen documents to apply for a second UK passport in other people's names. But, in a terse statement, the Home Office then said ministers had not been informed of the briefing note and have demanded that it be rescinded. A spokesman said: 'Ministers were unaware of this document and have instructed HM Passport Office to withdraw it immediately.' Mrs May suggested this morning that the passport office could be stripped of its agency status so ministers could have more control. 'In the medium to long term the answer is not just to throw more staff at the problem, but to make sure HMPO is running as efficiently as possible and is as accountable as possible. 'I have therefore asked the Home Office's permanent secretary Mark Sedwill to conduct two reviews, first to make sure HMPO works as efficiently as possible, with better customer services, better processes and better outcomes. 'And secondly to consider whether HMPO's agency status should be removed so it can be brought into the Home Office, reporting directly to ministers, in line with other parts of the immigration system since the abolition of the UK Border Agency.'","Those who urgently need passport to have applications fast tracked for free .

Robert Hart, 26, suffered fatal head injuries after being attacked in front of his girlfriend last Saturday as he danced with her in front of the main stage at the Parklife Weekender Festival in Heaton Park, Manchester. The attack took place as R&B star Snoop Dogg was due to perform and was thought to have been sparked by an inflatable doll being thrown into the crowd. Greater Manchester Police have released an e-fit image, left, of a man they are hunting after Robert Hart, right, died in hospital having been punched at the Parklife event in Heaton Park, Manchester on Saturday night . The shocking attack, which was caught on camera, left Robert Hart in a 'critical' condition after he was knocked unconscious. He died in hospital on Wednesday. Mr Hart, from Macclesfield, Cheshire . went to stop his girlfriend being hit with the inflatable but he was . punched to the floor and knocked unconscious. Two off-duty medic who . were at the event to watch live music, rushed to his aid and gave Mr . Hart CPR and he was rushed to hospital but he died four days later in . hospital after suffering a bleed to the brain. His parents and girlfriend were thought to be at his bedside. Police have now issued a e-fit of the prime suspect as detectives urged him to give himself up. Mr Hart, from Macclesfield, Cheshire, was knocked unconscious and was treated at the scene by two off-duty medical personnel, said Greater Manchester Police. Detective Inspector Richard Eales said: 'Our immediate thoughts go out to Robert’s family and loved ones. We currently have specially trained officers with them to help through this terrible time. 'We are still in the early stages of this investigation. 'However . several witnesses have assisted us with vital information concerning . the description of the offender. We believe a confrontation took place . following an inflatable doll hitting Robert’s girlfriend. 'We are aware other assaults took place in the park that evening but I am specifically appealing for witnesses who recall seeing the inflatable doll and the attack on Robert immediately thereafter. 'I am keen for those witnesses to come forward and other persons nearby who may have mobile phone footage of the attack or captured an image of the person responsible. 'Finally if you are the man responsible or were with him that evening, please come forward.' The fatal beating occurred at around 9.15pm when Mr Hart and his girlfriend were in front of the Festival's main stage. He was initially taken to a medical tent by security officers being being rushed to North Manchester General Hospital. His condition deteriorated and he was later transferred to Hope Hospital in Salford where he died on Wednesday. The attack happened at a peak time at Parklife Festival, pictured, on Saturday night at around 9.30pm . Police said the attacker is mixed race, in his late 20's and around 6ft 1 tall and was muscular with short, dark hair shaved at the sides. He was also wearing shorts and a blue, bomber-style jacket with the letter 'A' in white on the front. A spokeswoman for Parklife said: 'We pride ourselves on a history of Parklife Weekender without any incidents. 'We regret that an isolated incident has taken place at this year's event. 'However, medics were on the scene within minutes of it taking place. We urge festival-goers to help the police identify the individual involved and contact them if they have any information at all.' Mr Hart worked at Burton's menswear on Mill Street in Macclesfield town centre while he was studying his A-Levels. His former colleague, Casey Smith, who still works at the store, said she was 'deeply saddened', by news of his death. She said: 'I took Rob on at the shop in 2004 and he worked every weekend, and some week days when I could prize him out of his bed. He went off to study at university in 2006, I think it was Liverpool. 'He was a lovely, down-to-earth lad with an excellent sense of humour. 'I was only talking about him the other day. It's really sad.' Anyone with information should contact the incident room direct on 0161 85 69283 or email the incident room on mit.syndicate8@gmp.police.uk with any relevant footage.

"By . Ray Massey . Landmark ruling: Ronald Huzar, 58, has been awarded compensation from Jet2.com after a three-year legal battle . Millions of holidaymakers hit by long delays due to technical faults with planes will be entitled to claim compensation following a landmark court ruling. Airlines can currently avoid paying out if the jet has a mechanical or electrical problem by arguing it amounts to ‘extraordinary circumstances’ beyond their control. But the Court of Appeal has ruled this is not a proper defence, opening the floodgates to compensation claims dating back six years. Consumer groups hailed the decision as a major victory for travellers. It came after Ronald Huzar demanded compensation for a 27-hour delay that he and his family suffered on the way home from a holiday in Malaga in October 2011. The airline Jet2.com said it did not have to pay because an unforeseeable technical problem had grounded the flight. But the court yesterday ruled in favour of Mr Huzar. Richard Lloyd, executive director of consumer group Which?, said: ‘This ruling shows that airlines cannot avoid ducking their responsibilities by claiming that routine technical problems are extraordinary circumstances. More... Airline stocks fall sharply as Lufthansa issues profit warning revealing it struggled to cope with fierce competition and strikes . Central London gridlocked by black cab drivers' protest at introduction of cut-price fare app Uber... as technology firm reports huge surge in downloads . 'Thomson won't pay up for 16-hour ordeal': Why you can get £2,000 if your flight is delayed by a blocked loo - but not if it's hit by a bird . Protect yourself: Compare the best, and cheapest, travel insurance deals . ‘Airlines must be transparent about the causes of delay and ensure that consumers have sufficient information to exercise their rights.’ Mr Huzar had argued he was entitled to compensation under European Union regulations after suffering ‘no little inconvenience’ when the flight to Manchester left a day late. Under the current compensation regime, which applies across the EU, travellers can make a claim if a flight has been delayed for at least three hours and the airline has no legitimate excuse. Just how much they can claim depends on the length of the journey, rising from 250 euros (£201) per person on short haul flights to a maximum of 600 euros (£483). To avoid paying out, Jet2.com bosses claimed the problem which caused the delay – a technical fault on a Boeing airliner – amounted to an ‘extraordinary circumstance’. Jet2.com claimed a technical glitch delaying his flight by 27 hours was an 'extraordinary circumstance' and therefore they should not pay . Lawyers say the case could open the floodgates for compensation claims worth ‘billions of pounds.’ They say Mr Huzar’s case clarifies when a technical defect can be considered an ‘extraordinary circumstance’ and thus used as a valid defence by the airline to not pay flight delay compensation. Article 5 (3) of EU Regulation EC 261/2004, which came into effect on the 18th of February 2005, establishes common rules on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event that your flight is delayed, that you are denied boarding, or your flight is cancelled. Statistics from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) show 19.6 million passengers from the past six years could be eligible to make a claim, Bott and Co said. Around 90 per cent of these claims are due to technical defects, the spokesman added. The compensation rules apply to any flight departing from an EU Airport or flying into the EU with an EU carrier. The rules provide passengers with certain guarantees – refreshments, phone calls, overnight accommodation and, if appropriate, damages. Airlines must provide refreshments, phone calls, overnight accommodation irrespective. Their one defence to compensation claims is an ‘extraordinary circumstances’ defence. This includes ‘unforseeable’ events such as poor meteorlogical conditions, political instability, security risks, industrial action, and unforeseen flight safety shortcomings. But the defendant – in the this case the airline – must prove their case. But the court said this defence did not apply in Mr Huzar’s case because such technical faults do not count as events beyond the airline’s control – unlike terrorism, strikes, air traffic control problems and freak weather. It dismissed the airline’s appeal against an earlier ruling at Stockport County Court. The ruling means a family of four taking a summer holiday to popular hot spots around the Mediterranean could be entitled to around £800 compensation if delayed for more than three hours by a technical fault. Speaking after the judgment, Mr Huzar . said: ‘I am absolutely delighted with the decision. After everything I . have been through to get to this point it’s a  fantastic day. ‘I always hoped that we would get a positive outcome and it’s nice to get to this milestone.’ He added: ‘The result in my favour should help passengers throughout the country who have experienced similar  difficulties to me.’ His solicitor David Bott said: ‘The judgment states that technical problems, such as with the wiring on Mr Huzar’s flight, may be unforeseeable, but are ultimately caused by an event inherent in the running of an aircraft, and cannot therefore be considered to be an extraordinary circumstance.’ The three appeal judges in London said the onus of proof was on the airline to show that extraordinary circumstances existed and that delay could not have been avoided. The delay at the heart of the legal wrangle was caused by a wiring fault in  Jet2.com’s  Boeing 737-33A aircraft. All parties accepted that it was ‘unforeseen and unforeseeable’. But one of the judges, Lord Justice Elias, said that this should not be a reason to deny compensation as ‘it would be anticipated that unforeseeable problems will in general occur from time to time’. He said: ‘Whilst it would no doubt be accurate to say that the particular defect in the particular flight was not expected, since defects of that nature do arise from time to time, that is not in my view the same as saying that the particular problem was unexpected.’ He said that simply by using this defence airlines would ‘discourage inconvenienced passengers from pursuing their claims’. Lord Justice Elias added: ‘Mr Ronald Huzar suffered no little inconvenience when his flight from Malaga to Manchester was delayed. 'The appeal raises a point of some importance to the airline passenger industry.’ Open the floodgates: Mr Huzar's lawyers, Bott and Co, claim more than 19 million passengers from the last six years are now eligible to table a case for compensation (delayed passengers pictured at Heathrow last year)","Case opens floodgates to millions of holidaymakers hit by long delays .

"By . Sam Webb . A driver accused of killing a boy of five on a residential street was doing double the speed limit, a court heard. Wayne Payne was travelling at 61mph when he hit a bike on which Cameron Ward was sitting, Birmingham Crown Court was told. The crash happened in the Erdington area of Birmingham as the schoolboy's family returned home from an Easter party. The court heard Cameron was riding on the bike after complaining that he was tired. Crash: Wayne Payne was travelling at 61mph when he hit a bike on which Cameron Ward was sitting, Birmingham Crown Court was told. The five-year-old died at the scene . The machine . was being pushed by his father John  Ward as the pair, his partner Katie Lawrence and . their three-week-old baby headed towards a bus stop. Howard Searle, prosecuting, said Cameron was fatally injured as he crossed the road - which has a 30mph limit - with Mr Ward on April 1 last year. Mr Ward saw the headlights of a Vauxhall Vectra, being driven by Payne, in the distance before he stepped into the highway, the court heard. Loss: Floral tributes laid at the scene of Cameron's death in Court Lane, Erdington, Birmingham . Heartbreaking: A message for Cameron left at the scene of the crash . 'Mr Ward thought he had plenty of time to cross,' Mr Searle said. 'As he got to the middle of the road he heard the roar of a car engine and realised the car was much closer to him. 'It was this defendant driving well in excess of the speed limit. He froze on the spot.' He added: 'The car being driven by Payne did not brake at all but drove into the bicycle. It hit the rear. 'Cameron was flung into the air and his father was injured as well.' Payne, 31, of  Erdington, has denied causing death by dangerous driving. Mr Searle said the defendant lost control of the Vectra and it continued for 50 metres down the street before colliding with a parked car. Police and paramedics were called to the scene but could not save the boy. Mr Searle said an accident investigator later calculated that Payne had been travelling at 61mph shortly before the collision. He said the defendant, who later claimed he had tried to swerve, had admitted careless driving. Mr Ward, 37, said he had seen the lights of a vehicle about 200 metres away and he had gone out into the road between two parked cars . 'I thought it was safe to cross the road,' he said. 'It happened very quickly. It was over in seconds.' 'I don't know how I got up but I did. I knew he was dead. I wanted to disappear. Cameron was my life and I had lost him.'

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Banks must be stopped from pouring ‘petrol on the fire’ of Britain’s booming housing market, Vince Cable warned today. The Business Secretary stepped up his warnings about the risk posed to the economy by a new property bubble, risking renewed tensions with George Osborne who has played down the threat. The International Monetary Fund yesterday said global action was needed to prevent a repeat of the 2008 crash. Business Secretary Vince Cable said he had been 'alarmed' at the size of loans some banks were willing to offer . Mr Osborne is expected to tackle the issue of house prices in his annual Mansion House speech later. The Chancellor is due to back plans to free up more brownfield land for housing, insisting building more homes is the only way to tackle soaring prices. But Mr Cable has pre-empted the speech, with a series of extraordinary warnings about the dangers of access to cheap loans. He appeared to suggest ministers could interfere in the Bank of England’s independence by demanding action to cool the market. The Business Secretary said he had been 'appalled' to discover the size of loans being agreed by some lenders and urged the Bank of England to use its powers to intervene. Asked whether there should be a strict cap, the Liberal Democrat cabinet minister told BBC Radio 4’s Today: 'It is crucially important that the banks don’t throw petrol on the fire. Chancellor George Osborne is expected to use his Mansion House speech  to address concerns about the housing market . 'Most of us who have been through various housing booms in the past have recognised that a kind of stable level is three or three-and-a-half times . 'I was appalled when I discovered that banks were lending five times. 'They have already reined it back on advice from the Bank of England but this is the key area that the Bank of England has got to operate in to make sure that this boom in house prices, particularly in the south of England, doesn’t destabilise the whole of the economy. 'The Bank of England gives guidance, hopefully steering the banks into making sure that the money goes into supporting small and medium-sized companies and getting long-term growth going rather than in fuelling house prices. 'That is the role of the Bank of England. They now do it in subtle ways but it is clearly their responsibility.' Some banks have already moved to restrict lending - with Lloyds and RBS declining mortgages of more than £500,000 where that is more than four times earnings. Mr Cable accepted that tighter restrictions would mean many in London could not afford to buy but said the interests of the country as a whole had to be addressed. 'The desires of individuals have to be balanced against the stability of the economy as a whole,' he said. 'I don’t want anyone to suffer but we have to make sure that the boom that is currently taking place in prices does not get out of control.' It follows a warning from the IMF that rising house prices around the world could threaten a new crash. Min Zhu, deputy managing director of the IMF, said: 'Housing booms have different characteristics across countries and time periods. 'What is common is that when the bust comes, it very often damages financial stability and the real economy. 'The tools for containing housing booms are still being developed. The evidence on their effectiveness is only just starting to accumulate. The interactions of various policy tools can be complex.'","Business Secretary steps up alarmist warnings about property prices .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Accused: Ian Walters has been charged with the murder of his wife Tracy after a car crash on the M1 . A former church treasurer has been . charged with murdering his horse rider wife by swerving off a motorway . and smashing their car into a tree. Tracy Maria Walters, 48, died in hospital two days after the collision on the M1 near Markfield, Leicester. Her . husband, Ian John Walters, 50, was behind the wheel of the black . Mitsubishi L200 Animal when they careered off the south carriageway into . a tree on March 21. Mr Walters was also flown to Coventry's University Hospital with serious injuries but survived. Today . police confirmed Walters, a former Parochial Church Council treasurer . at Christ Church in Swindon, Wiltshire, has this week been charged with . Mrs Walters' murder. A . spokesman for Leicester Police said he appeared at Leicester Crown Court . on Monday and was remanded in custody to appear again on June 23. Mrs . Walters, from Swindon, was a keen endurance horse rider - an equestrian . sport in which participants take part in competitive long distance . races. Following her death, a . tribute was posted on the Endurance GB (EGB) website - the national . body for endurance riding in England and Wales. Tragic: Tracy Maria Walters, 48, who was an endurance horse rider, died in hospital two days after the crash . The tribute, which was released after Mrs Walters’ funeral in Swindon on May 30, read: 'Tracy was well known in the group and very good at supporting new members as well as producing the group newsletter. She will be sadly missed by us all. 'After the service the family released helium filled balloons shaped as horses - it was very moving as five horses disappeared into the sky up towards the Ridgeway where Tracy loved to ride. 'There was also a beautiful floral tribute in the shape of an Appalosa horse - many of you will know that Tracy had a beautiful three-year-old old Appalosa, Missy, who she was hoping to start this year. Crash: Ian Walters was behind the wheel of the Mitsubishi when they careered off Junction 22 of the M1 near Markfield, Leicester, and hit a tree. The couple was airlifted to hospital where Mrs Walters later died . 'Tracy’s family have requested that donations in memory of Tracy could be made to Fairfield Farm College which is an Independent Specialist College for students with learning disabilities. Horse Studies is one of their curriculum areas. 'When Tracy’s horse Tristan retired from competitive rides Tracy kindly loaned him to the college. Tristan was used to teach horse care and riding and also went to local shows with students.' Karen Collier, EGB chairwoman, added: 'Such terribly sad news. Tracy has been such a supporter of EGB, both as a rider and as a technical steward. 'Tracy had ambitions to further her competitive career with us and how sad it is that these dreams were not to be realised. 'Her contributions to EGB have been much valued. Our thoughts must go to her husband and sons at this most difficult of times.' A family notice posted ahead of Mrs Walters’ funeral described her as a 'loving wife, mother and grandmother.'

"By . Mia De Graaf . The private firm that decides whether benefit claimants are fit for work has a backlog of more than 700,000 people, it has emerged. Atos has been berated by ministers as the number of people awaiting assessment has more than trebled to 712,000 in four years. The figures are the latest in a catalogue of failures by the firm, which has been forced to end its Government contract ahead of schedule. Not satisfied: Work and Pensions Minister Mike Penning told MPs at the department's select committee yesterday that Atos Healthcare is incapable of carrying out the work capability assessments . Blasting the company, Work and Pensions Minister Mike Penning said: 'I don't think Atos had the capacity to do what was asked.' A Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) spokesman addressing the Work and Pensions Select Committee added that Atos 'couldn't deliver the quality at the capacity we want'. The DWP said the total backlog stood at 712,000 people - 394,000 new claimants and 234,000 awaiting reassessments to decide whether they are still entitled to the benefit. A further 84,000 are people still on incapacity benefit who have not yet been moved over to ESA. Mr Penning admitted the government failed . to meet its own deadline of moving these people onto the new benefit by . April, and they are still awaiting assessment. Atos Healthcare has regularly come under fire over the assessments – which are used to gauge eligibility for employment and support allowance and incapacity benefit – amid claims people are being wrongly recommended for work or put through stressful medical interviews. One third of its decisions have been overturned on appeal and the firm has become a lightning rod for Left-wing critics of the Government’s welfare reforms. Backlog: With Atos in charge, a backlog of 712,000 claimants has built up - three times more than in 2010 . The company revealed it has been in discussions with officials for ‘several months’ about ending its work capability assessment contract, which was due to run until August 2015. But speaking at the Commons Work and Pensions Select Committee, representatives of the firm claim they have been 'vilified' by the Government despite doing what was asked of them. Senior vice president Lisa Coleman said Atos had become a 'lightning rod' for public anger and it was 'massively over-simplistic' to think a change of provider would change that. Mr Penning said a decision in March to end Atos's contract early was based on the fact he had lost faith in the firm. He said a new contractor - expected to be appointed in early 2015 - would not be chosen on cost alone but on its ability to carry out the assessments in a timely and proper fashion. The DWP said: 'Incapacity Benefit . reassessment has resulted in over 700,000 people looking for, or making . steps to return to work - it is crucial that we continue this important . process to ensure that people are not written off and we get a fair deal . for the taxpayer.'","Government blasts firm as figure more than trebles in four years .

The couple were spotted leaving achingly-trendy celebrity hotspot The Chiltern Firehouse in north London last night after spending some quality time together away from the hustle and bustle of Westminster and their children. It was something of a step up for Cameron, who was accused of using vouchers to pay for his £12.75 pizza and Samantha's £10.90 lasagna on a romantic night out last year.

They were joined by model Laura Bailey, The Wolf of Wall Street star Margot Robbie, socialite Lady Victoria Hervey and actress Lindsay Lohan. But Cameron and his wife seemed keen to hide their following of London's in-crowd, and left via the building's back entrance following their evening together. The couple are the latest high-profile figures to be seen at the venue, which boasts David Beckham and Lily Allen among its regulars . The meal was something of a step-up for Mr Cameron, who was chided for using vouchers to pay for a previous romantic meal with his wife at chain Pizza Express . The . Chiltern Firehouse in Marylebone, which is owned by luxury hotel magnate . André Balazs, is the current restaurant of choice for London's . A-listers and elite. This . week alone it has hosted singer Lily Allen, model Kate Moss, talk show . host Piers Morgan and X Factor boss Simon Cowell, who took partner . Lauren Silverman to the restaurant on Tuesday. It has also been frequented by Cameron's predecessor Tony Blair, who was seen there with his wife, Cherie, last month.

Rita Ora, Cara Delevingne and David Beckham are also said to be among the new restaurant's growing list of regulars. Mrs Cameron set a patriotic tone for the . Camerons' latest meal, matching a red and white dress with a blue . blazer, while her husband kept it simple in a black suit and slightly . unbuttoned blue shirt.

"By . Dan Bloom . Fraudster: Helen Smith, 42, arranged fake music exams for five pupils at her Sheffield home . A piano teacher has been ordered to pay compensation to students who she tricked into taking bogus grade exams. The pupils were told they had passed with flying colours at Helen Smith's home in Sheffield, South Yorkshire - but were devastated when their certificates never turned up. Smith, 42, was found guilty of fraud after she arranged for a fake examiner to test the five pupils, three of whom were under 18. She was spared jail today at Sheffield Magistrates Court, where she insisted the whole situation was an administrative mix-up. Smith said: 'I think I have suffered quite a lot for something I don’t believe I’ve done, even now.' In a separate case, the General Teaching Council had already banned Smith from teaching in schools for two years for claiming sick pay while on holiday. During Smith’s trial last month, the court heard how students had paid fees and were tested on December 15, 2012. Smith told magistrates she had arranged the exams in good faith with the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music (ABRSM). But Lynne Butler, deputy head of UK operations for ABRSM, said the organisation had no record of any exam taking place and had not sent any examiner to the property. The court heard that Sharon Copley, the mother of one of Smith’s teenage pupils, said she had already booked a Grade Five piano exam through official channels. But Smith told her that her daughter should attend the test at her own house, where she was told she had passed before discovering the truth. 'She was absolutely devastated,' Ms Copley said. 'To be told by somebody you trusted that you have passed with a distinction and to then find out the person she looked up to hadn’t told the truth, she felt humiliated and let down. It knocked her for six.' Smith said an administrative error by the board was possibly to blame for it having no record of the tests, nor of sending an examiner to the address on the day in question. But she was convicted of six counts of fraud by abuse of position, and one of fraud by false representation between February 2012 and March 2013. Smith, who was unrepresented, told the court she had been the victim of a hate campaign. Denial: Smith continued to protest her innocence before she was ordered to pay £1,500 compensation . 'I’ve had my house smashed, I’ve had threatening phone calls, I’ve had all the windows smashed and I feel very unsafe,' she said. But District Judge Sheila Driver told her: 'You did hear from the victims when they gave evidence of the stress - particularly on the younger victims - when they realised they hadn’t achieved what they thought they had achieved. 'And the fact that they had to re-take exams they believed they had already passed. 'You attempted to involve yourself in a game of smoke and mirrors, but your evidence was inconsistent, not credible, and frankly nonsense. 'I am satisfied that all victims suffered a financial loss due to a false representation by you and I therefore find you guilty of all charges.' District Judge Sheila Driver told Smith at Sheffield Magistrates' Court: 'You attempted to involve yourself in a game of smoke and mirrors, but your evidence was inconsistent, not credible, and frankly nonsense' Smith was sentenced to a 20-week prison sentence, suspended for 12 months. She was ordered to attend 15 sessions in Sheffield’s Together Women Project, and to pay £1,500 in compensation to her five victims at £50 per month. She was also given a curfew order, under which she must remain at her home address between 7pm and 7am every day.","Helen Smith, 42, arranged exams at her home in Sheffield for five pupils .

"By . Richard Spillett . An angry mother who took on Disney over their failure to stock Star Wars figures for girls has won her battle to get Princess Leia toys in stores. Natalie Wreyford of Walthamstow, north-east London, took to Twitter to vent her fury after discovering Disney Stores only sold figures of the male characters from the classic films. Her comments spiralled into a huge online campaign that has this week seen Disney relent and agree and to add Princess Leia toys to its merchandise. Campaign: Londoner Natalie Wreyford was shocked to discover that Disney Stores did not stock Princess Leia figures for her six-year-old daughter, Honor's, birthday party . Ms Wrayford was shocked at Disney's reply to her Twitter request and started a campaign for girls' toys . The issue came to light after Ms Wreyford, 42, organised a Star Wars-themed birthday party for her six-year-old daughter Honor and four-year-old son, Seth. While she found her local Disney store stocked figures of all the film's male characters, such as Luke Skywalker and Hans Solo, she could not find any Princess Leias. Ms Wreyford told MailOnline: 'I was passing the store in Covent Garden and noticed they had a new Star Wars range out. 'They are fabulous dolls - they are large, interactive and speak quotes from the films. Honor, six, in her bedroom with Star Wars posters on the wall. She was desperate for a Princess Leia doll . Seth, pictured in his bedroom, got the doll he wanted. His mother Natalie thinks Disney is making decisions about what girls and boys like and don't allow the children to decide for themselves . 'I wanted to get a doll for both my children, but none of them were of female characters - and certainly not Princess Leia, who was noticeably absent. 'As soon as Seth opened his (doll), Honor said ""I want a Leia one"". I felt terrible. 'I knew she was going to say it. There was an anticipation that she was going to get one, but I knew I couldn't fulfill it. 'She was so excited, but when I had to tell her they don't do Princess Leia dolls, she was absolutely crushed. She burst into tears.' Ms Wreyford said it was 'very tricky' explaining to her daughter why no female Star Wars characters were available. 'You . don’t want to be having these conversations with your child when they . are that young about why they have not included Princess Leia alongside . all the male characters. 'It's really uncomfortable. We felt betrayed and shut out by Disney.' She believes gender labelling could have a negative effect on children. Disney Stores only stocked toys related to Star Wars' male characters Hans Solo, played by Harrison Ford (left), and Luke Skywalker, played by Mark Hammill (right), but not Princess Leia, played by Carrie Fisher . 'On the Disney website, all the Star Wars toys are categorised and nearly all are for boys. I think Disney are a bit behind the times. 'They are making decisions about what girls and boys like and don't allow the children to decide for themselves. 'It's self-fulfilling if Disney tells you something is not for you - it means you don't build it up as a passion. 'I'm worried it has an impact on what choices they make for themselves later in life and how they are perceived by other people. When she tweeted the store to complain, . she received the reply: 'Currently, there are no plans for Leia products . at the Disney Store, Natalie. Have a wonderful day!' A toy shop stocking dolls and toys for girls and boys including Star Wars' Darth Vader (right). Ms Wreyford's campaign has now gone escalated after the #wewantleia hash-tag took off . The reply sparked a global online campaign using the hastag '#WeWantLeia' and a petition to have toys from the films aimed at girls stocked in the shops. After weeks of pressure, Disney was forced into a U-turn this week and agreed to bring in the toys. A Disney spokesman said: 'The current assortment of Star Wars products at the Disney Store launched earlier this year, and is just the beginning of what is to come. 'We're excited to be rolling out new products in the coming months, including several items that will feature Princess Leia, one of the most iconic characters in the Star Wars galaxy.' Celebrating the news on Twitter, earlier this week, Ms Wreyford wrote: 'Thank you so much everyone who supported #WeWantLeia. We did it!!' She thinks Disney may bring out the Leia dolls in time for Christmas. 'It's amazing. I was disheartened in the middle of it all, but my husband said at least people are talking about it,' she said. Natalie Wreyford's crusade against Disney is not the first time children's toys have sparked a sexism row. In November, Debenhams removed 'girls' and 'boys' signs from its toy departments following a sustained campaign from a parent-led action group. Let Toys Be Toys, which campaigns against gender stereotyping, also scored a success two months earlier when Toys R Us agreed to drop similar labelling for its products. Gendered toy signs have also been removed from major stores including Boots, Tesco, Sainsbury's, TK Maxx and Marks and Spencer. Speaking after Debenhams announced the changes, Kerry Brennan, Let Toys Be Toys campaigner, said: 'This is a particularly important victory for me. 'It was heart-breaking shopping in Debenhams with my small daughter who chose toys from the ""boys"" section without realising.'","Natalie Wreyford furious after discovering store didn't sell female character .

"By . Sam Webb . A man reported missing for four years while his wife and her friend claimed £77,000 benefits in his name died of natural causes, a coroner has ruled. The remains of Geoffrey Howard Sturdey, 60, were eventually found under a rockery at the 'wildlife haven' and religious community where they lived near Tregaron, Ceredigion, Wales. Wife Rebekah, 56, and friend Boqe-Ore Adie, 43, secretly buried him and claimed he’d gone travelling round Europe. Geoffrey Howard Sturdey, who died of natural causes but was then secretly buried in his garden while his wife and her friend continued to claim his benefits . Wife Rebekah (left), 56, claimed he'd gone travelling around Europe to explain his absence. Boqer-Ore Adie’s daughter Hazel was also present at the inquest . In February this year, they were each given 20-month prison sentences at Swansea Crown Court after pleading guilty to unlawful burial and fraud. At an inquest into Mr Sturdey’s death, Ceredigion coroner Peter Brunton declined to offer his condolences to Mrs Sturdey, who was present at the inquest having already completed the custodial part of her punishment, because it would 'not be appropriate'. Boqer-Ore Adie’s daughter Hazel was also present at the inquest. The inquest heard how the pathologist who undertook a post-mortem on Mr Sturdey’s body could not give a formal cause of death, and he could only be identified from his dental records. Resting palce: Police forensic teams searching for Geoffrey Sturdey's body in the flowerbed at Beth Berith in June 2013 . Mr Sturdey’s GP, Jacqueline James, the last professional person to see him alive, paid him a visit in October 2008, and identified a number of risk factors, including diabetes and high blood pressure, which she likened to a 'ticking time bomb'. Detective constable Sarah Totterdale from Cardigan CID, gave lengthy evidence about the 'very complex' police investigation which took place at Mr Sturdey’s home - Beth Berith, Llwynygroes, near Tregaron - in June 2013. She said that following suspicions raised by the Department for Work and Pensions, the house was searched and a number of documents were found, including a note which read '48 days since Shamar fell asleep', and a letter from Adie’s daughter Hazel, which said 'some day soon me and Shamar will be raised'. Personal readings were also found in a plastic wallet, one of which said: 'Shamar fell asleep on the sixth day of the seventh moon'. A mechanical digger uncovering Geoffrey Sturdey's body at Beth Berith, Llwynygroes, in June 2013 . The inquest heard how during the police investigation, it became apparent that four women: Sturdey, Boqer-Ore, Hazel and another daughter, Karmel Adie had an interest in the Old Testament and Hebrew teachings. 'Shamar' is a Hebrew word meaning 'to watch'. A nine-page document relating to the burial of Mr Sturdey was discovered, and at around 5pm on 17 June police found an 'area of interest' in a flower bed near the front door, where his body was discovered. Recording a verdict of death by natural causes, Mr Brunton added: 'If matters had ended there, and he had been buried normally, we wouldn’t be here today. 'It’s not for me to go into the criminal aspects but what happened afterwards meant that there was a very complex enquiry. I find that his body had been buried in accordance with his will in a raised flower bed near the front door of his property. 'Basic requirements were clearly not met in this case. Mr Sturdey’s body lay undisturbed for five years until the enquiry started. This is undoubtedly a most extraordinary and mysterious death.' He added: 'It is customary for me to offer my condolences to the relatives of the deceased, but in this case I don’t think that’s appropriate.'","Geoffrey Sturdey died in October 2008 and was buried by wife and her friend .

"By . Julian Robinson . Jordan Daniel Heslin had to ask staff to open the automatic door at Lloyds bank in Stanley, County Durham moments after trying to walk out with more than £2,000. He was jailed for two years at Teesside Crown Court . A bungling bank robber had to ask staff to open the door to let him out - and even apologised to the cashier before fleeing. Jordan Daniel Heslin’s escape plan did not start well when the automatic door failed to open and he was forced to return to the counter to ask: 'Can one of you let us out?' Durham Crown Court heard that the debt-ridden 22-year-old, who searched the internet at his local library for tips on how to rob banks, was seen pacing up and down the street outside the Lloyds bank on Front Street in Stanley, County Durham. He then entered with his hood pulled up and a scarf partially covering his face before handing a note to a female cashier. It read: 'I have a gun. Stay calm, I don’t want to hurt anyone. I need £6,000. Don’t put it in a bag. I’ll be out in a hurry. Sorry.' Victoria Lamballe, prosecuting, said: 'Panicked and shaken, she didn’t know what to do next and shouted to a branch manager. 'She, in turn, looked at the note and glanced at the defendant who said: 'I’m sorry, I’m desperate.' The manager took some £10 and £20 notes from a drawer and showed them to Heslin, who told her: 'That’ll do.' When the door was opened, he left with £2,140 but the robbery was so low key other customers were unaware it had even taken place. However, closed-circuit footage was circulated which led to Heslin being quickly identified. The court heard his own grandmother recognised him. 'He fully admitted the offence and told police that having spent the previous morning in a JobCentre, he felt all he needed to make something of his life was some money, which is when he decided to rob a bank. 'He researched it at the library and felt he needed £6,000 to pay off his debts, which would leave some money for his children and £1,000 to start his new life. 'He then said he summoned up the courage to enter and approached the cashier.' He told police that he understood the fear he had caused the bank staff and felt sorry for them. Police arrived at the scene quickly and although a man was arrested shortly afterwards, he was released after offering an alibi. Heslin, of Edward Street, New Kyo, near Stanley, County Durham, was arrested at a friend’s flat in Gateshead early the next day, still with £1,703. He admitted a charge of robbery. Peter Walsh, mitigating, told the court: 'It was clear he was almost apologising to the bank staff involved, telling them: “I’m sorry” and “I’m desperate”. 'Even the manager who was present said she felt: “What a stupid lad. What have you done?” The view down Front Street in Stanley, where Jordan Heslin was seen pacing up and down the street outside Lloyds bank before the robbery . 'Her colleague said she did not want to think badly of him because of the way he came in. 'This illustrated the unique nature of how these offences were committed. 'Given the camera images it was only a matter of time before he was traced. 'When police found him he assisted an officer in retrieving the money.' Mr Walsh added that Heslin was ‘sick of being in debt’ and having previously worked full-time was only on a zero-hours contract at the time of the robbery. Jailing him for two years, Judge Neil Clark said: 'You walked into that bank and committed what appears to have been a somewhat apologetic robbery. 'But, what you chose to do was completely wrong. 'You were naive in the way you carried it out, but you were acting irrationally. 'Those in the bank did not know if there was a gun present or not. 'Although terrified, it’s clear neither probably thought you had a gun, but they couldn’t take the risk.'","Jordan Heslin passed note to Lloyds bank cashier saying he had a gun .

"By . James Salmon . Follow @@JamesSalmon79 . Apple, Starbucks and Fiat are being investigated by Brussels over claims they received ‘sweetheart’ deals to cut their tax bills. The European Commission is concerned that authorities in Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg gave the companies preferential treatment in breach of EU rules. If they are found to have avoided tax, the three multi-national giants could face huge bills covering the past ten years. Tax probe: Customers test iPads at the Apple store at the Confluence shopping centre in Lyon, France . Last night, experts said the multi-national giants could be hit with ‘horrendous’ bills. Joaquin Almunia, the EC vice president in charge of competition policy said: ‘In the current context of tight public budgets, it is particularly important that large multinationals pay their fair share of taxes.’ Algirdas Semeta, commissioner for taxation added that ‘fair tax competition is essential for the integrity of the single market.’ The probe marks an escalation of attempts to stamp out tax avoidance by big companies, which has risen up the political agenda in recent years. Apple and Starbucks are among a number of US giants accused of avoiding tax for years through elaborate networks of subsidiaries. Other big names in the spotlight include Google and Amazon. The EC’s intervention comes after a US senate probe last year revealed Apple had sheltered billions of dollars in profits from tax by using ‘ghost companies’ registered in Cork which  were not resident in  any country for tax purposes. This has allowed it to pay no corporation tax on international sales, including in the UK. By channelling sales through Irish companies the Senate Committee found the California based company paid no corporation tax to any country on £18bn in profits made outside the US between 2009 and 2012. Starbucks has also found itself at the centre of a political storm after it emerged it had only paid corporate tax in the UK once in 15 years of trading, despite racking up more than £3billion of sales. Starbucks told a UK parliamentary investigation in 2012 that it received a tax deal in the Netherlands which allowed it to enjoy a ‘very low’ tax rate. It caved in to public pressure in December 2012 and agreed to pay £20m of corporation tax over two years to the UK government whether or not it reports a profit. Workers package boxes to be sent to customers in the Amazon  Fulfilment Centre at Rugeley, Staffordshire . Richard Murphy, of Tax Research UK said: ‘These companies are guilty of blatant tax avoidance that undermines their local competition. They could be hit with horrendous fines. ‘Hopefully this will help create a level level playing field on tax which would be good news for every honest business based in the UK.’ But an Apple spokesman said: ‘We have received no selective treatment from Irish officials. Apple is subject to the same tax laws as scores of other international companies doing business in Ireland.’ A Starbucks spokesman said: ‘We comply with all relevant tax rules, laws, and OECD guidelines and we’re studying the Commission’s announcement related to the state aid investigation in the Netherlands.’ Last night they received the backing of business leaders in the UK, with influential lobby group the Institute of Directors accusing the EC of using its state aid rules as a ‘political weapon’ to increase its influence on the tax affairs of EU members. Allie Renison, trade and Europe policy adviser, said: ‘There is a risk here that the Commission is trying to be seen to be doing something about corporate tax compliance by inserting itself into the sovereign tax affairs of individual member states under the cover of concern about state aid infringement.’ She added: “There is a legitimate discussion to be had about tackling perceived tax avoidance, but conflating different debates is not the way to do it. The EU must not put politics ahead of economics.’","European Commission probes Irish, Dutch and Luxembourg tax deals .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Thieves posed as builders stole a 60ft-long wall in broad daylight - and one neighbour even helped them sweep up the mess. The two men wearing high visibility jackets spent an hour leisurely dismantling the handmade 1890s wall, which is believed to be worth £4,000. Before loading it into a flatbed lorry, the pair were offered a broom by a nearby resident who thought they had been hired to do the work. Disappeared: Owner Leigh O'Shea, 56, arrived at the home she is renovating in Westcliff, Essex, to find the wall outside had been stolen. A neighbour said he watched the thieves thinking they were builders . Owner Leigh O'Shea of Westcliff, Essex, said: 'At first I thought someone had reversed into the wall and it had collapsed but then I saw the bricks had gone, apart from some broken ones and a lot of rubble. 'I just couldn't believe it. It seems ridiculous that something can be there for more than 100 years and they just come and take it.' The 56-year-old, who is a lecturer and nurse at the University of Essex, is renovating the property, which has been derelict for 15 years. Ms O'Shea, a mother of five, discovered what had happened when she brought a friend along to have a look at the property. She said: 'A man nearby said he saw two people that did it loading onto a yellow flatbed lorry between 11am and 11.30am. 'They started at about 10am. He just assumed I had hired them to take it down. He even handed them a broom because he didn't think they had cleared up very well.' Before: The 60ft-long brick wall, which dates back to the 1890s, is believed to be worth £4,000 .

'Doing up this house was one of those dreams you have,' she said. 'The opportunity to buy it came up and I thought it was now or never.

"By . Chris Pleasance . The killer of Anni Dewani, murdered on her honeymoon in South Africa four years ago, is critically ill in hospital, it emerged today. Xolile Mngeni is serving a life sentence for her murder in Cape Town in 2010, while she honeymooned in the city with her husband Shrien, 33. Mngeni - whose trial was delayed for surgery to remove a brain tumour - was admitted to Groote Schuur Hospital on Tuesday and is said to be in a 'serious and critical condition'. Xolile Mngeni, the man who murdered Anni Dewani on her honeymoon in Cape Town in 2010, is critically ill in hospital, it has been revealed . Mngeni's trial was delayed after he was diagnosed with pineoblastoma, a rare form of cancer with a very low survival rate. Doctors will not say if his latest illness is related to the cancer . Simphiwe Xako, spokesman for the Department of Correctional Services, said: 'He was transferred from the correctional services centre to the hospital. The doctors said he's in a critical condition.' Xako refused to comment further on Mngeni's illness, or say whether it was related to his previous battle with cancer. Mngeni was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2011 and underwent an operation, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. A Groote Schuur Hospital report submitted during Mngeni's trial showed that he was suffering from pineoblastoma, a rare form of cancer with a low survival rate. Jeanette Parkes, head of the hospital's radiation oncology department, cautioned at the time that if the tumour recurred, treatment options would be limited. Anni Dewani was killed shortly after marrying Shrien Dewani (left) who was extradited to South Africa in April to face trial accused of ordering the murder . But according to South African news reports, a scan in late 2012 appeared to show the cancer had been successfully treated. Mngeni was first incarcerated at Pollsmoor Prison before he was moved to Brandvlei Prison, which has better medical facilities. Shrien Dewani was extradited in April to stand trial, accused of ordering his wife's killing. He denies any involvement in his wife's murder and was sent to hospital for psychiatric observation ahead of the trial, which comes before court again on June 20. Her body was found with a single gunshot wound to the neck after she and her husband were kidnapped while travelling in a taxi through the outskirts of Cape Town. Three men, including Mngeni, have already been convicted in connection with Mrs Dewani's death.","Xolile Mngeni serving life for killing Anni Dewani on her honeymoon .

"By . Becky Barrow, Business Correspondent . Four thousand people are getting a job every day – the largest increase since records began,  official figures revealed yesterday. The data saw the pound hit an 18-month high against the euro as investors speculated that the Bank of England will be forced to raise interest rates before the end of the year. It was thought the Bank would not act until after the General Election in May, but increasing numbers of analysts now believe the first hike since 2007 could come possibly as early as November. The number of people in work has reached a new record high of 30.5million, after a rise which was the highest since records began in 1971. Four thousand people are now getting a job every day, according to the figures . Flipside: But figures also show a dramatic slowdown in pay growth, prolonging the squeeze on family finances . Between February and April, the Office for National Statistics said a record-breaking 345,000 people started work, raising Britain’s total workforce to a new high of 30.5million. Since the Coalition came to power in May 2010, more than two million private sector jobs have been created. Meanwhile, the public sector workforce has shrunk by nearly 400,000. This excludes the distorting impact of ‘reclassifications’, such as staff at Lloyds Banking Group, which was rescued by the State, being switched from the public to the private sector. Last night Samuel Tombs, of Capital Economics, described the rise in employment as ‘colossal’. David Cameron said it meant more people had ‘the security of a pay packet and a brighter future’. Esther McVey, the employment minister, said: ‘Businesses up and down the country are feeling increasingly confident about creating jobs.’ Three years ago, Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said it was ‘a complete fantasy’ that the private sector could replace jobs lost in the public sector. Of those aged between 16 and 64, the ONS said 72.9 per cent are working, which is within touching distance of the all-time high of 73.1 per cent. Neil Carberry, of the CBI, said: ‘This is an unprecedented rise in the number of people in work. Unemployment continues to fall, down 347,000 over the last year to 2.17million people, the largest annual drop in the number of people looking for work for six years.’ The unemployment rate is now 6.6 per cent. Employment minister Esther McVey said young Brits were the best in the world and urged critics to stop talking down their prospects . The figures come a day after manufacturing growth jumped to a new three-year high in April after a 4.4 per cent surge in output on the same period in 2013. The performance was the strongest year-on-year showing since February 2011, adding to hopes that overall GDP accelerated in the second quarter. The ONS figures showed an improvement in output of 0.4 per cent compared with a month earlier. Yesterday’s statistics revealed that although the country’s workforce is bigger than ever, the pay squeeze remains in place. John Philpott, of The Jobs Economist website, said: ‘Britain’s jobs market is booming everywhere apart from in most people’s pay packets.’ The average pay rise is just 0.7 per cent, far below inflation of 1.8 per cent, which means people’s bills are rising much faster than their pay is going up. It is a squeeze which has lasted for six years, meaning many workers complain their family finances are close to breaking point or that their lifestyle has changed for the worse. Martin Beck, of the Ernst & Young Item Club, said: ‘The stark contrast between a robust jobs market, but meagre wages growth continues. For the recovery to truly hit home, pay packets need to start growing again.’ The ONS said the figure was distorted by a big jump in pay rises in April last year as a result of the tax change, which cut the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p on earnings over £150,000. As a result, the annual bonus bonanza enjoyed by bankers and other workers was delayed. The figures also cast doubt on claims that only part-time jobs have been created since the financial crisis began as Britain stages its economic recovery. Between February and April, full-time jobs were created more than three times faster than part-time jobs.","345,000 more jobs in 3 months, biggest rise since records began in 1971 .

Corey Davies, 20, was driving his white convertible BMW when his sister Raquel Davies, 23, and her fiancé Lee Jenkins, 25, died in a car crash. The engaged couple had a baby son called Harley who has been left orphaned by the deaths of his parents. Victims: Lee Jenkins, 25, and his 23-year-old fiancee Raquel Davies were killed in a road crash . The pair died instantly in the smash because the car’s soft-top gave them no protection when it overturned - but Davies escaped unscathed. Davies, of Porth, Rhondda, South Wales, appeared before magistrates to face two charges of causing death by dangerous driving and a further charge of leaving the scene of an accident. He was remanded in custody by Pontypridd magistrates. A Davies family spokesman said: '[Raquel] was perfect in every way and was a devoted mother to her young son. 'She would help anyone out at any time and was a beautiful person inside and out. She loved her fiancé immensely.' Mr Jenkins’s family said in a statement: “He loved his fiancée Raquel dearly and was enjoying being a new dad to Harley. 'Lee was a keen and talented footballer when he was younger.

She has taken the £30,000-a-year school to an employment tribunal claiming she was unfairly dismissed after she was fired in May 2013. The . hearing, in Birmingham, was told Ms Stokes had worked at the school for . 17 years before she was sacked following a ‘breakdown of trust and . confidence’. The . tribunal also heard that days after she was fired, Ms Stokes sent an . email to all 750 students at the school claiming she had been sexually . assaulted by a female member of staff. Ms . Stokes was also accused of making threatening phone calls and sending . abusive text messages to former colleagues she felt ‘had betrayed her’, . the tribunal heard. She . is suing the school for £24,000 in loss of wages and ‘hurt feelings’ claiming she was sexually assaulted and on another occasion manhandled . by a male member of staff. Ms . Stokes, from Shrewsbury, Shropshire, told the tribunal that she was . sacked because of her activities with the UCAT trade union. Giving . evidence on the first day of the tribunal, she said: ‘The first time . [she was sexually assaulted] was in 2009 and then again two years . later.’ Solicitor . Charles Sparling, representing the school, asked why she had taken more . than 18 months to inform the police, to which Ms Stokes replied: ‘A lot . of the reports police receive about sexual assaults are historical.’ Claims: Ms Stokes has taken the £30,000-a-year school to an employment tribunal claiming she was unfairly dismissed after she was fired in May 2013 . She added . that she felt ‘traumatised’ following the alleged assaults and claimed . she was threatened by another member of staff in February 2012 because . she organised an unauthorised union meeting. She said: ‘He threatened me with the sack and placed his hands on my polo-shirt collars and said “we will get you for this.’’ Ms . Stokes admitted sending an email to staff and pupils claiming she had . been sexually assaulted saying she ‘regretted her actions’ adding that . she did it while suffering ‘great emotional distress.’ However, she denied sending messages to former colleagues, including one which read: ‘Careful when you go home. The tribunal heard that days after she was fired, Gillian Stokes sent an email to all 750 students at Shrewsbury School, pictured, claiming she had been sexually assaulted by a female member of staff . ‘Things are bad out there. We wouldn’t want you to have an accident.’ Mr Sparling told the tribunal that between 2005 and 2012, Ms Stokes had filed 16 grievances against the school. The tribunal heard the school had taken out a High Court injunction and restraining order against Ms Stokes after she took to ‘picketing’ outside the school gates in the months following her dismissal. The tribunal is expected to last five days. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Gillian Stokes suing prestigious Shrewsbury School claiming unfair dismissal .

"By . Julian Robinson . A Lidl employee was forced out of his job after he blew the whistle on ‘degenerated and mouldy’ food being sold to customers, an employment tribunal heard. Matthew O’Donnell, 28, alerted senior managers after he spotted defrosted products on sale alongside mouldy fruit and vegetables at a store in Hanham, Gloucestershire, it was said. He claims the stock was compromised after the fridges and freezers were turned off for more than four hours during a heatwave for maintenance. Matthew O'Donnell, pictured outside the Lidl store in Hanham, Gloucestershire, has claimed he reported mouldy fruit at the shop . But the products were still on sale the next day and Mr O’Donnell claimed customers were even directed towards the products to ‘maximise consumption’. When the former employee made a complaint he says his concerns saw him bullied out of his job by bosses and co-workers after they were told he had ‘dropped them in it’, it is claimed. He has now taken the company to an employment tribunal where a judge will decide whether he suffered detriment or dismissal for exercising his rights. But Lidl has accused Mr O’Donnell of ‘grossly misinterpreting the situation’ and claims he left after finding he was not suited to the role. Mr O’Donnell told the tribunal: ‘I stated I felt let down by the procedure, which meant every time I spoke up to alert management to hazards I was always being penalised with harassment and loss of hours. ‘I had simply had enough.’ The tribunal in Bristol heard that Mr O’Donnell took up a job at the city’s Hanham store on June 8 last year after moving from Wales. He described how, during a night shift on July 7, an electrical contractor began upgrading electrics and the power was switched off for ‘over four hours’. He said: ‘The loss of power resulted in store deliveries being unable to be processed safely, chill cabinets not being secured as well as freezers defaulting to defrost mode, which severely compromised the integrity of the food stocked within the store.’ Mr O'Donnell claimed the stock at Lidl, pictured, in Hanham, Gloucestershire was compromised after the fridges and freezers were turned off for more than four hours during a heatwave for maintenance . He said when he returned to work the next day he found mould in the fruit and vegetable section and products ‘seriously degenerated’, four days prior to their use-by date. Mr O’Donnell then sent a report to senior Lidl officials, believing he would be protected from victimisation by the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998. He said he told managers he felt that he was responsible if anything happened to members of the public. But Mr O’Donnell, from Kingswood, Bristol, claims his initial complaints were dismissed by store manager Krysztof Golanski who said he was told by electricians that power was only down for two hours - the maximum allowed under company policy. He then took his complaints to personnel department at the company’s regional distribution centre in Weston-super-Mare. 'Every time I spoke up I was always being penalised with harassment and loss of house,' Matthew O'Donnell tells tribunal . The tribunal heard that Mr O’Donnell claims when he returned to work he became aware that Mr Golanski had advised all staff that he had ‘dropped them in it’. He said he found himself axed from shifts and ‘ostracised due to malicious rumour-mongering’. He claims he faced extra pressure at work, such as being told to scan faster on the tills or face a disciplinary for poor performance. His situation got so bad that Mr O’Donnell said he was forced to hand in a resignation letter, on September 9, due to the ‘lack of support and ongoing hostility, especially with ongoing food hygiene failures and lack of meaningful resolution of the dispute’. Smair Soor, a barrister representing Lidl, told Mr O’Donnell under cross examination that his version of events was a 'gross misinterpretation' of the facts. He added: ‘It might be that you didn’t find working in retail convivial. You had long queues and felt under pressure by your performance.’ The tribunal also heard that Mr O’Donnell was told he could be sacked after taking complaints about the food to senior company officials. Giving evidence, store manager Mr Golanski said the threats had not been intentional and were instead taken in the wrong way. The tribunal was expected to finish today.

"By . Lucy Osborne . Ordeal: Walter Crompton, 83, was held in a cell for seven hours and forced to give DNA samples as he was accused of poisoning his wife of 60 years Eileen . A grandfather arrested and banned from seeing his wife after he gave her a painkiller patch at her care home said last night he had been treated like ‘a hardened drug dealer’. Walter Crompton, 83, had attached the prescription patch to her arm after she told him that she had been left in severe discomfort by arthritis. But staff at Allendale Care Home, in Blackley, Manchester, where the dementia sufferer has been living, contacted police because the patch contained morphine. Four days later Mr Crompton – who had been his wife Eileen’s only carer for 15 years before she became seriously ill and went into the home –  was arrested on suspicion of ‘administering a noxious substance’. He was even locked up for seven hours in a police cell. But only after a two-month police probe has he finally been cleared of wrongdoing. Yesterday the RAF veteran – who has lost weight and struggled to sleep since his arrest – said: ‘This whole sorry business has been hanging over me for months and I think the way it has been dealt with is absolutely disgusting. ‘I’ve had a hell of a time and been treated as if I was like some kind of hardened drug dealer. ‘I’ve never committed a crime in my 83 years and for this to happen is mind-boggling. ‘For the police to say I’ve tried to harm my wife is unbelievable. ‘She had complained of arthritis in her arm and I said I had a pain patch in my pocket so I put it on her arm. ‘I used to look after her 24 hours a day so I know what she can and can’t have.’ Support: Walter and Eileen, now both 83, pictured (left) on holiday in Weston-Super-Mare in 1960 and (right) at a wedding in 1993. Walter had been Eileen's only carer for two years before she went into a home in April . He said: ‘I have never been in a cell before. I’ve only seen stuff like that on TV. ‘I never had anything to eat from morning to night when I was in the cell.’ Mr . Crompton was asked to give fingerprints and a DNA sample and his house . was searched, before he was interviewed by officers at midnight. He . was eventually released and taken home at 1am but as part of his bail . conditions he was barred from contacting his wife of 60 years. The . retired British Aerospace aircraft engineer later had his bail . conditions relaxed slightly so that he could see his wife – but only if . accompanied by a social worker, who was not always available. He added: . ‘I’ve been missing my wife greatly because before of all this. Alert: Staff at Allendale care home in Blackley, Manchester, alerted police after Mr Crompton went home . ‘I used to be allowed see her every day but after my arrest I was told not to contact  her at all. ‘I was allowed to visit her later but only under supervision with someone watching over us. ‘Two . or three days per week I had no one to go to the care home with me so I . was restrained from seeing my wife. It was terrible. Then on Monday . when I went to the police station they told me there was no case to . answer. ‘They said all accusations had been dropped. Why couldn’t . that have happened after two weeks? It’s been an absolutely horrendous . three months.’ Instead, officers from the Greater Manchester Police . Public Protection Investigation Unit started an investigation and a . ‘multi-agency strategy meeting’ was held. Detective Superintendent . Joanne Rawlinson said: ‘This was a potentially serious incident in . which a vulnerable elderly woman with significant health issues could . have come to serious harm and, as such,  people would expect the police . to always conduct a thorough investigation. ‘An integral part of the . inquiry was to safeguard the potential victim and, while the . investigation was ongoing, bail conditions were necessary to ensure . this happened. ‘After twice interviewing the 83-year-old man, we . presented a file of evidence to the CPS and they ruled there is . insufficient evidence to proceed to a charge.’ A spokesman for . Allendale Care Home said: ‘We strictly follow the guidelines with . regard to patient care and protection to ensure they receive the highest . standard of care.’","Walter Crompton gave wife Eileen painkiller patch prescribed by doctor .

"By . Amanda Williams . The moment a machete-wielding armed robber made off with £18,000 from a security guard has been caught on camera by a brave motorist who then chased him in his van. Bystander Philip Hoare, 41, filmed on his mobile phone as he tailed the attackers, giving police a running commentary as he drove. It came after Ricky Maidment, 27, threatened a G4S guard as he delivered money to a Tesco Express store in Fordingbridge, Hampshire. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The moment a machete wielding armed robber wrestled £18,000 from a security guard has been caught on camera after a brave motorist chased them in his van . On the run: The robber is seen on the footage making off with the cash deposit box containing £18,000 . Bournemouth Crown Court heard that the armed robber then ran towards a waiting Land Rover where accomplice Gary Allen, 41, was waiting before racing away from the scene. Allen sped 'erratically and dangerously' through residential streets and country roads in a bid to lose Mr Hoare. At one point they managed to get the cash free from the secure box it was in and threw the box towards the windscreen of his van in a bid to stop him. But the demolition company boss - a father-of-two - was able to swerve out of the way. Mr Hoare stopped a cyclist travelling in the other direction and told him to wait by the box until officers arrived to collect the vital evidence. Bournemouth Crown Court heard that the armed robber ran towards a waiting Land Rover where accomplice Gary Allen, 41, was waiting before racing away from the scene . At one point they managed to get the cash free from the secure box it was in and threw the box towards the windscreen of his van in a bid to stop him. But Mr Hoare was able to swerve out of the way . The 15-minute chase continued until the Land Rover headed down a private dirt track that was impossible for Mr Hoare to negotiate in his van. But thanks to his detailed commentary, police were already waiting at the other end of the track, blocking off the escape route. Within seconds, the pair from Salisbury, Wiltshire, were arrested and the full £18,000 recovered. Mr Hoare was not meant to be in Fordingbridge that day but ended up there by mistake when he took a wrong turn. He said adrenaline just took over after he saw Maidment waving the knife around and threatening the guard, on March 5 this year. Mr Hoare said: 'I know I would have wanted somebody to have done something if it was me, so I did what I could. 'I can’t stand bullies and this guy had a machete over this poor security man’s head. I had to do something. 'I don’t consider myself a hero. My wife said I was mad but I think anyone else would have done the same.' Gary Allen (right) , who has no previous . convictions, and Ricky Maidment (left), who has a long criminal record, . admitted one charge of armed robbery . The court heard Allen had only agreed to be the getaway driver because he was desperate to raise the cash he needed to visit his terminally ill stepson in hospital. He had been visiting Jake, 19, at Salisbury Hospital where he was being treated for cystic fibrosis, the court heard. But a recent move to Southampton General Hospital, Hampshire, meant the daily visits had become more expensive. Allen, a tree surgeon, met Maidment at Salisbury Hospital and initially refused the chance to make some extra money. But he finally agreed to act as the getaway driver after work slowed and doctors revealed his stepson has just six months to live. Allen, who has no previous convictions, and Maidment, who has a long criminal record, admitted one charge of armed robbery. Allen, who has no previous convictions, and Maidment, who has a long criminal record, admitted one charge of armed robbery from the store in Fordingbridge, Hampshire, (pictured) Judge Samuel Wiggs jailed Allen for 32 months, saying his case was 'exceptionally tragic' and the term was the 'very least' he could impose. He added: 'I am sorry that you have let your family down in this way. I am sorry for the inevitable effect this will have on your son.' Maidment was jailed for four years eight months and was given a concurrent one-year jail term for possessing a blade. Frank Abott, defending, said the robbery had been masterminded by a third party who recruited Maidment due to his long record. The man was questioned by police but not charged. Speaking after the case, Detective Constable Bob Rees, from Hampshire Constabulary, said Mr Hoare had been 'crucial' in detaining the suspects. He added: 'I consider Mr Hoare a hero. He monitored, he filmed, he gathered evidence for us and put himself at risk doing so. 'But he remained calm and collected, acting in an intelligent and considered manner. The investigation would have been much more difficult and protracted if it was not for his intervention.'","Witness Philip Hoare filmed on his mobile phone as he tailed the attackers .

"By . Amanda Williams . More than 200 holidaymakers have launched legal action against Butlins after they claim undercooked food and filth swimming pools left them violently ill. The families say they were left with severe sickness, stomach cramps and diarrhoea after days at the holiday park in Bognor Regis, Sussex. Many claim they were served undercooked meals, that hot food was mixed with existing food trays, and that it was constantly surrounded by flies and pigeons. More than 200 holiday-makers have launched legal action against Butlins after they claim undercooked food and slimy swimming pools left them violently ill at the park in Bognor Regis (pictured) They also claim the water in the pool was dirty and cloudy, and that there was slime building up around the edge of the swimming area. Families said as a result of their illness, they were told to leave early, while others say they were completely ignored by staff members. Alison Hill, 55, a group leader of Mencap Hillingdon North, visited the site for five days in June 2011 with seven other volunteers and the group’s 21 members. The carer, from Middlesex, said: 'When one of our group members became ill I complained to the resort staff, but was then seen privately by a manager who asked me not to tell other guests about the illness and also asked if the party could leave early. 'We were stunned. 'Having to return earlier than planned caused major disruption, as day-to-day carers for some of our members were on holiday themselves and did not expect us to be returning early. 'Over two years on, we have still not been on another overnight visit as a group simply because we all do not want to go through the emotional and physical distress again. Families have since launched legal action after they claim they were left with severe sickness, stomach cramps and diarrhoea after just days at the centre in 2011 . 'It is really worrying that other people have also suffered illness since our time there. 'We know all too well how falling ill can ruin your holiday.' Amy Denny, 24, from Northampton, had booked a break at the resort with her partner Philip and sons Bailey and Finley, but was forced to return early. The healthcare assistant said: 'My youngest son Bailey was only 18 months at the time and we had to take him to hospital as we were so scared about the effect that the illness had on him. 'It is so upsetting that it was our first holiday together as a family and it has scarred them for life.' They . have now instructed law firm Irwin Mitchell to start court proceedings . after Butlins' parent company Bourne Leisure Ltd denied any liability . for the outbreak between May and July 2011. Elizabeth Tetzner, of Irwin Mitchell, said: 'Our clients have given us worrying accounts of their stays, including concerns regarding cleanliness, standards of food preparation and service as well as their treatment by staff at the site. 'Bourne Leisure Ltd has denied liability and as such our clients have been left with no other option than to issue court proceedings as they seek justice for their ruined holidays. 'Unless an out of court settlement can be achieved on satisfactory terms, these clients’ claims will be determined at trial in court. 'Gastric illness can have a devastating impact on people’s health and the effects of it cannot be underestimated. 'We have acted in numerous cases where our clients have been left with long term health problems.' A spokesman for Butlin’s at Bognor Regis said: 'We will robustly defend this speculative action raised at the High Court in Birmingham. 'We operate our resorts to the highest health and safety standards and work closely with the Health and Safety Executive to ensure that our guests’ safety takes priority. 'Our standards of cleanliness and hygiene are recognised throughout the tourist industry world-wide. Such is our reputation on health issues that environmental officers from around the UK have described our policies and procedure as outstanding.'","Families claim they had severe sickness, stomach cramps and diarrhoea .

Mr Withall watched the birds fly to and from the hose reel in his outbuilding (pictured) from his nearby campervan . Although wrens are regular visitors to British gardens it is rather odd to see them set up home in such a well used place . 'Further inspection showed that it was a domed wrens’ nest and it was also lined with horse hair and feathers. 'I left well alone until I saw the pair bringing in food and grabbed my camera, using my campervan as a hide. 'While occasionally snapping the wrens’ progress, I was amazed to see the female robin also very energetically feeding the wren chicks too. He said: 'The robin feeding the wren chicks rather took me by surprise, and all my bird watching friends couldn't believe it either' 'Her chicks had already flown their nest in the garage roof. 'This went on for almost a week, but I think she is now ensconced with her own second brood as food is so plentiful at the moment.

Obviously we have the medical department that knows malaria very well and they gave me tablets. I was in bed for two days. ‘When they heard the news everyone was talking.

"Manu Tuilagi will start England's second Test against New Zealand on the wing in the biggest selection call of Stuart Lancaster's reign as head coach. Driven by the need to bring as much firepower to bear as possible on the All Blacks, Tuilagi will be shifted from outside centre to accommodate the established RBS 6 Nations partnership of Billy Twelvetrees and Luther Burrell. Twelvetrees will be making his first appearance since damaging ankle ligaments six weeks ago while Burrell returns after helping Northampton claim the Aviva Premiership title. Wide threat: Manu Tuilagi moves to the right wing for the second Test against New Zealand on Saturday . Moving Tuilagi on to the right wing opposite the prolific Julian Savea, who has recovered from a knee problem, is a brave but exciting decision that has been under consideration for the past six to 10 months. The 23-year-old last filled the position for Leicester in 2011 and was conspicuous as England's most potent attacking force in the 20-15 defeat at Eden Park from his accustomed position at 13. With victory at Forsyth Barr Stadium on Saturday essential to set up a series decider in Hamilton, the timing of the change is risky, but Lancaster is convinced it will work. Quick recovery: Danny Care returns as scrum-half after minor shoulder surgery saw him miss the first Test . 'We had to make sure in training that Manu understood the way our wingers defend and was comfortable with that because obviously it's a change for him,' Lancaster said. Straight back: Owen Farrell was one of 15 players from Premiership finalists Saracens and Northampton to be made available comes in at fly-half . 'He was happy and certainly when we talked through our strike plays we've got some real options now. 'We've got that balance in our backline we've always looked for, which is pace, power, ball-carrying and footballing ability. 'Having seen Manu play on the wing at age grade and understanding how effective he was, I always thought of it as an option. 'What we've now got is some real quality in the centres who can get the ball to him. 'The ball will be kicked to him a fair amount so he'll have plenty of counter-attack opportunities. 'But we have to be careful not to suggest we're basing our whole gameplan around one player because we're certainly not. 'The physicality of our centres has not been diminished by picking Billy and Luther. Luther can do things and distribute in ways Manu can't.' Lancaster is confident that Twelvetrees - who offers the playmaking option at inside centre he favours - is ready to play despite his recent inactivity. Centre stage: Billy Twelvetrees is back after an ankle injury to partner No 13 Luther Burrell . 'All you can do is trust your instincts and in what you see in training,' said Lancaster, who has made seven changes, two positional, following last weekend's defeat in Auckland. 'Everything I have seen in training has led me to believe that Billy is ready to start.' England are confident Tuilagi, who ousts Jonny May from the 23 completely, has the pace, speed on the turn and defence to make the transition a success. The only question mark hangs over his aerial ability, but a plan has been devised to compensate for his shortcomings in this area. Big presence: Tom Wood replaces James Haskell at blindside flanker in the only change to the starting pack . 'If Manu doesn't quite get up in the air and someone else catches it, he'll tackle them. Quite hard,' Lancaster said. Sitting lower on the selectorial Richter Scale than Tuilagi but surprising nonetheless was Geoff Parling's retention in the second row alongside Joe Launchbury. Courtney Lawes, another of Northampton's Premiership heroes, was expected to replace Parling but the British and Irish Lion's leadership, line-out expertise and superb performance in the first Test have proved decisive. Rob Webber has won the 50-50 call over Dylan Hartley while Ben Morgan continues at number eight with Billy Vunipola sitting on a heavyweight bench that is central to England's gameplan for Dunedin. It is hoped the arrival of Hartley, Lawes, Vunipola and wing Chris Ashton in the final half-hour will tip the scales against the All Blacks. Rewarded: Rob Webber keeps his place despite the arrival of Dylan Hartley, who will come off the bench . 'We feel the game is going to take the full 80 minutes to win and part of the selection has been the make-up of the bench,' Lancaster said. 'The likes of Dylan, Courtney and Billy Vunipola will bring a huge amount of energy from the bench and hopefully see us home. 'Billy's quite a good person to have on your bench when he's angry and annoyed because he's missed out on starting. 'Chris' role will be coming on and getting on the end of linebreaks - we made quite a lot of linebreaks last week but didn't quite finish them off.' As expected Tom Wood returns at blindside flanker with the unlucky James Haskell dropping out of the 23 altogether. Owen Farrell and Danny Care, who has recovered from a shoulder problem, start at half-back with Freddie Burns offering fly-half and full-back cover from the bench. M .

The 23-man squad will take tablets for 12 days in a bid to combat the disease, which is particularly prevalent in the north of Brazil and in Manaus where the Three Lions kick off their campaign on Saturday. But the antimalarial drug Malarone causes side effects which include diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain and headaches. And with one in 10 people usually affected, there is a danger that some of Roy Hodgson’s men could take ill over the coming days.

Rare: More than 1 in 10,000 people who take Malarone . - hallucination . No choice: Roy Hodgson accepts his players must take the medication . The England boss, however, would rather his players suffered the side effects than contract malaria. ‘It’s . a question for the doctors really: I went to Manaus and I didn’t take . any for the two days I spent there,’ said Hodgson, whose staff will also . take the medication. ‘That might just be something to do with the fact that I’m not a football player. As far as I’m concerned, I’ve got to go with medical opinion. 'If the doctors are telling me that, when we go to Manaus, the players must take malaria tablets, whether it has side effects or not, what do I do? 'I can’t turn around and say: “We will not take malaria tablets” because the bottom line is it’s better to have stomach cramps or whatever it is for one player in 10 than have someone contract malaria, because that would be unthinkable.’","Three Lions squad began course of medication on Tuesday .

"By . Chris Foy . Follow @@FoyChris . England's coaches are confident that Ben Youngs can thrive on a return to the starting XV at Eden Park on Saturday, as they brace themselves to rule out Danny Care. The Harlequins scrum half was officially named in the tourists’ line-up on Wednesday night for the first Test against the All Blacks, but it appears increasingly likely that he will be forced to withdraw from the match. Care will have a fitness test on Thursday morning and if, as expected, a shoulder injury prevents him from taking part in the series opener, Youngs will be promoted from the bench. Stepping in: Ben Youngs (right) will take Danny Care's place in the England starting XV . On the ball: Youngs looks for a pass as England trained at the Takapuna Rugby Club near Auckland on Thursday . Faith: England coach Stuart Lancaster believes Youngs is returning to his top form in time for the daunting New Zealand tour . It has not been a vintage season for the Leicester No 9, but Stuart Lancaster claimed that he is returning to peak performance levels in time for this daunting clash with the world champions. ‘It would be a big blow losing Danny, but that would be lessened by Ben whose form picked up at the end of the season,’ said England’s head coach. ‘If you go back to the game in 2012 when he started against New Zealand, that was him at his best and he's approaching that form now.’ Lancaster strongly hinted that Care will be removed from the side for this weekend’s encounter, in order to be back at full throttle for the second and third Tests, adding: ‘Danny is 50-50 I'd say at the moment. We want to make sure we're doing right by him. 'To go into a Test against the All Blacks with anyone who is not 100 per cent physically and mentally would be a poor decision, so we need to make sure he's 100 per cent right.

I know he's desperate to play because he's been exceptional in the Premiership and for us this season. We have to do the right thing.’ Yet another enforced reshuffle by England would include a bench role for Lee Dickson, even though the Northampton scrum half was among the players involved in last Saturday’s Aviva Premiership Final, and thus – theoretically – out of contention to play here. But Lancaster has no misgivings about asking the experienced Saint to be ready for an international appearance so soon after a long-haul flight.

"By . Joe Bernstein . Initially, there was stunned silence when Nikica Jelavic watched the World Cup draw at his pal Edin Dzeko’s place in December. Dzeko’s Bosnia were pulled out to face Lionel Messi’s Argentina in the Maracana. The prize for Jelavic and Croatia was even more daunting; hosts Brazil in the tournament’s opening match tomorrow, with an anticipated worldwide television audience of 750 million. Now the shock has worn off, Jelavic is embracing the magnitude of the task. ‘It’s the kind of game you dream about,’ he says. ‘Brazil are my favourites for the tournament but we have quality players too. We can qualify, we have nothing to lose.’ No fear: Nikica Jelavic insists Croatia are unnerved at facing Brazil in the World Cup opener . On the move: The Croatia striker joined Hull from Everton to get in shape for the tournament . Like most Croatians, Jelavic — who joined Hull City from  Everton in January to get match-sharp for the World Cup — doesn’t do inferiority complex. As a relatively young nation, wearing the shirt with pride is more than a cliche for Croatia, as England will remember from their 3-2 win at Wembley in 2007 that spelled the  end for Steve McClaren. ‘I don’t know what it’s like in England, but in Croatia we play with our heart. We go out feeling on top of the world, no matter how small we are as a country,’ explains Jelavic. ‘On the pitch, it is 11 against 11 and we believe the Croatian first XI can play against any team. ‘Look at the clubs some of the players are with. Luka Modric is a top player with Real Madrid. Mario Mandzukic is the centre forward with Bayern Munich. Our captain Darijo Srna has more than a hundred caps, he could go to any team in the world. We have plenty of good players and lots of young talents.’ The stand-out name to English fans is Modric. He graced Spurs for four years before moving to Madrid where he has proved himself worthy of galactico status after winning the Champions League. Underdogs: Croatia shocked England in 2007 to take their place at the 2008 European Championships . Suited and booted: Nikica Jelavic wears the new Warrior Skcreamer Pro football foots . ‘Modric is one of the best in the world,’ insists Jelavic. ‘I wouldn’t like to say if he’d get in the Brazil team, he is Croatian so it doesn’t matter — he will play for us! He is definitely at the top level. ‘As a striker, it’s very easy to play with him. He can see  everything, so all you need to do is find the space to run into. Do the movement and he will get you the ball.’ A couple of other familiar names should also be on show. Former Arsenal striker Eduardo is in the squad to face Brazil, the country where he was born. So is ex-Tottenham defender Vedran Corluka. Niko Kranjcar misses out after picking up a hamstring injury in QPR’s play-off win over Derby. Band of brothers: The striker believes Croatia have the players to pull off surprises at the World Cup . Pocket rocket: Real Madrid's Luka Modric is a world class player, according to Nikica Jelavic . After the laid-back years of Slaven Bilic, hardman Niko Kovac is in charge. ‘He was my first captain in the Croatia team — a great leader. And he’s the same as manager,’ says Jelavic. Having played in Britain for four years with Rangers in Glasgow, Everton and Hull, 28-year-old Jelavic will also keep a close eye on England’s prospects. Interestingly, as a player who has worked in five different countries, he thinks England’s chances are fatally wounded before a ball has been kicked because of fatigue. He says: ‘There are always big expectations on England. They have very good players but the season is too long, too many games. Upward trajectory: Former Croatia captain Niko Kovac is now head coach after replacing Slaven Bilic . ‘Everywhere in Europe you have a break in the winter. In England we played eight games in a month from the start of December, it really is too many and means the players aren’t fresh for a Euro or a World Cup. ‘That is the reason England can’t win big competitions despite all these talented  players and a massive army of supporters. I can’t remember the last time they reached the semi-finals (Euro 96). It is a long time ago. ‘England is a big football country. But you can’t say you are favourites — there are always a few teams before England.’ Rising star: Nikica Jelavic has tipped former Everton teammate Ross Barkley (C) to star in Brazil . On a more positive note, Jelavic expects his former Everton team-mate Ross Barkley to prove he’s ready for the World Cup at the age of 20 — provided he is given a licence to thrill by Roy Hodgson. I am not surprised he is going to the World Cup,’ said Jelavic. ‘When I signed for Everton, I watched him train at first, then he got more chances and his  progression was really quick and he is showing what he can do. ‘He is one of the biggest talents I have played with. ‘He is unbelievably fast with the ball, even faster with the ball than without the ball! ‘Why can’t he do that at the World Cup? Just let him play like he does for his club. Don’t speak to him too much.’ Nikica Jelavic wears the new Warrior Skreamer Pro.

Galatasaray finished runners-up in the Turkish top flight and won the Turkish Cup under Mancini's care, while they also reached the last 16 of the Champions League before exiting at the hands of Chelsea.

"By . Chris Cutmore . Follow @@Chris_Cutmore . You know what you’re getting with the US Open: knee-high rough, putting greens like glass and the toughest test in all of golf. Hit it straight or you’re dead meat, right? Well, maybe not this year at Pinehurst. Rather startlingly for the US Open there will be no rough. That’s right – none. Instead, Pinehurst’s fabled No 2 course has widened fairways, which bleed into waste areas featuring all sorts of funky hazards: sand, gnarled tree roots and hollows. Punters can usually feel safe backing steady, straight hitters at the US Open – think Justin Rose (28-1) or Graeme McDowell (50-1), two champions from the last four years – but the 114th edition of America’s national championship poses some different and difficult questions. Repeat performance? Justin Rose is looking to defend his US Open title after victory at Merion last year . Challenging: The No 2 course at Pinehurst has no rough but large waste areas instead . Experience: Graeme McDowell, pictured playing out of the sand during a practice round at Pinehurst on Tuesday, won the 2010 US Open . The odd fairway hazards are not the only puzzle. Whereas US Opens usually feature thick rough surrounding the greens, at Pinehurst there will be nasty run-off areas with grass cut short to gobble up any approach shots even slightly off target. A centimetre here or there could be the difference between a birdie putt or a desperately tough up-and-down for par. This will place extra stress on the players’ short games and makes wizards with the wedge such as Phil Mickelson (16-1) or Luke Donald (40-1) extremely tempting bets. The greens will play as usual for a US Open – like greased lightning. A good week with the flat stick is essential for any winner of the year’s second major. Just ask Webb Simpson (40-1) or Jim Furyk (40-1), both past champions. But if the key to this US Open is hitting the right spot on the greens then those who can bomb the ball a mile off the tee, hit more than their share of fairways and hit shorter into the greens could be the men to watch. Pinehurst No 2 is a par-70 of some 7,562 yards – that’s long. So step forward Rory McIlroy (11-1), Adam Scott (12-1), Bubba Watson (16-1) and Henrik Stenson (28-1). Magician: Phil Mickelson's short game could prove key at the 114th US Open this week . Precision: Luke Donald's natural ability on the greens should help him conquer Pinehurst . Bet NOW with Coral! But the point about this US Open is that it seems not to favour one particular suit: Pinehurst promises to put each facet of every player’s game through the wringer. The last two champions, Michael Campbell (2005) and Payne Stewart (1999) won with 72-hole scores of even par and one under, so no-one is going to burn up these fairways. The player who will get his hands on the trophy will need to shine from tee to green, possess the short game to bail him out of trouble when needed, have a proven ability to putt on superfast greens and have the x-factor to deal with the quirks of this classic course. All of which points to Phil Mickelson (16-1). Lefty finished second at Merion last year, the sixth time he has done so. The 43-year-old Californian is without a top 10 on the PGA Tour all year but an 11th place at the St Jude Classic last week suggests he is peaking at the right time. But if there’s one thing we’ve learned from Mickelson it’s to expect the unexpected. How much pressure the FBI’s investigation into his financial affairs has piled on his shoulders is impossible to know, but the Open champion is chasing a career grand slam and craves victory in this event more than any other. His time will surely come, and he looks a good bet to do it this week. But if you’re looking for someone a bit more dependable, look no further than Stenson. The Swede has a poor record at the US Open but no-one hits the ball farther and straighter while not needing to take the risk with a driver. The world No 2 could barely miss a fairway or green while winning the money list titles on both sides of the Atlantic last season and has a dead-eyed putting stroke from six feet or so, crucial to saving pars. Stenson also has four top 10s in his last seven starts worldwide and is final edging back towards the form that made him nearly unstoppable in the second half of 2013. So close: Mickelson has finished second at the US Open six times but has never won the tournament . Big hitter: Henrik Stenson (centre), who is available at 28-1, will be looking to use his distance off the tee . Finding his form: Rory McIlroy goes into the US Open as the 11-1 favourite . Another reliable, straight hitter worth a punt is Jason Dufner, whose US PGA triumph came on another Donald Ross-designed course at Oak Hill (although Pinehurst No 2 has undergone restoration by Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw for this tournament). Dufner’s wedge and short iron play were also inch-perfect last August - exactly what is needed here – and a recent playoff defeat to Scott in Texas proves his top form is not far off. At 40-1, Dufner is a better bet than Rose, who is unlikely to repeat his victory at Merion. While Rose is a wonderful player and in good touch, only Curtis Strange and Ben Hogan have pulled off back-to-back US Open victories in the modern era. McIlroy is the favourite to win with good reason. His victory at Wentworth last month proved he can now win on courses where course management is crucial, as it will be at Pinehurst. The Northern Irishman won this event three years ago. And the world No 6 is absolutely striping the ball right now. At 11-1, however, his price might be just too short for any man not called Tiger. Among the other favourites, Scott is in top form and will surely feature, but question marks hang over the world No 1’s putting stroke and short game after a relatively disappointing Masters defence. Watson won at Augusta, should benefit from the widened fairways here, and has been the best player in the world this year. But again his short game might be found just wanting. Jordan Spieth (25-1), the 20-year-old wunderkind Watson saw off for the green jacket, is likely to again fall just short at this early stage of his career. In the frame: Australian Adam Scott, pictured during a practice round at Pinehurst, should be in contention come Sunday . New blood: Jordan Spieth is aiming to win his first major at Pinehurst after just falling short at the Masters . Finally, it might just be worth a cheeky wager on one of the short-game whizzes in the field at big prices. Victor Dubuisson (80-1) worked miracles at the WGC-Match Play Championship and Jonas Blixt (80-1) has wowed galleries in big events since his US PGA breakthrough last year and Simpson (40-1) is both a former champion and grew up playing Pinehurst. But one man who quietly fancies his chances is Donald (40-1). The Englishman has been undergoing swing changes but should benefit more than most from the widened fairways. His irons and wedges are laser-guided, his putting almost unsurpassed and if he misses the green he is a genius from sand and short grass alike. Three of the last four US Opens have been won by Europeans, and if Donald drives the ball well he could be this week’s surprise package. *All prices correct at time of publication - subject to change.

"By . Chris Foy In Auckland . Joe Marler used to put the All Blacks on a pedestal. He doesn’t now. The Harlequins prop believes England have shattered the world champions’ aura and can beat them here — as long as they rediscover the ability to catch. Going into this three-Test series, the tourists wanted to deconstruct the myth of Kiwi invincibility. Steve Hansen’s team won all 14 matches they played in 2013 and have lost only once since their 2011 World Cup triumph, at Twickenham in December 2012. Belief: Joe Marler is confident that England are close to shattering New Zealand's aura of invincibility . Last week, England’s under-strength side went to Eden Park and were not behind on the scoreboard until the 70th minute — or at any time when they had 15 men on the field. The outcome was a 20-15 win for the All Blacks, but the moral victory belonged to Stuart Lancaster’s men, who dominated in many aspects. Marler produced a superb performance at loosehead as England’s pack gained supremacy in the scrum and had the upper hand in many of the collision areas. He was left with the conviction that the Kiwi players are mere mortals who crack under extreme pressure. ‘We went into the game having spent the build-up trying to get rid of this All Black myth or aura of how they are invincible,’ said England’s No 1. ‘We respect them as a team and know they have several world-class players — and they are world champions so we respect them for that. But Saturday helped us even further to realise, “Actually, we can go toe to toe with these guys”. Now we just need to go that extra step.’ Moral victory: Although they lost the first Test, Stuart Lancaster's England side were dominant and impressive . Marler was not among the players with close-quarters experience of seeing New Zealand beaten, having not featured in the record 38-21 triumph at home 18 months ago. Instead, he had continued to nurture the belief that Kiwi supremacy was just a fact of his sport. He said: ‘I’ve always looked to the All Blacks as year in, year out the best team in the world and you just automatically think they have the best players in the world from one to 15. But when you break it down and look at them as individuals and collectively, there are 15 blokes on a field trying to do the same as you. A lot of boys in their team are world class, and we respect that, but we have to go out there and give it our best shot.’ Late pain: Conrad Smith scored a late try, the only one of the game, to seal victory for New Zealand . Despite being without so many leading players, that is what England did at Eden Park and cracks in the black edifice were exposed. The aftermath of the tense series opener has been marked by Kiwi accusations that the tourists set out to slow down the match in order to negate the home side’s high-tempo approach. Marler dismissed the barbs, saying: ‘We want to play at a high tempo and we showed that in the Six Nations when we took France, Ireland and Wales on at that sort of game. ‘I didn’t see them running to any of the scrums or lineouts quicker than us. It’s not a tactic of ours to slow the game down. ‘As a spectator or a neutral you’d probably look at it and (say) it wasn’t a great game to watch because there were a lot of dropped balls and set-pieces. That’s why the game was slow.’ Room for improvement: England can beat New Zealand if they improve their catching, says Joe Marler . Asked if England would have faith in their fitness in a free-flowing contest — as there is likely to be under the roof in Dunedin — he added: ‘Yes, we’ll back our fitness, as long as we’re catching the ball!’ Any attempt by England to add pace to their game would be enhanced by the return at scrum-half of Danny Care, who has recovered from a shoulder injury. As a Quins team-mate Marler is well aware of the 27-year-old’s threat, and he said: ‘He’s that little ball of energy that lifts a game when it has slowed down. He does a quick tap, sparks boys and gets forwards round the corner quick. He brings good tempo.’ Following the first Test, Marler revealed on Twitter that Care — his room-mate — had written him a motivational letter. He admitted yesterday that he didn’t see it until the match was over, but appreciated the gesture nonetheless. ‘I received it after the game,’ he said. ‘I got back to the room and saw this letter on the bed. I said, “DC, what’s this?”. He started laughing and said, “Sorry mate, I didn’t realise you’d left for the game”. It was very touching. We’re very close and he’s an emotional guy.’ Whether it is by writing letters or dismantling auras, England are finding ways to make a proper contest of this daunting series.

'All the players that have gone pro have worked hard.

British interest at Queen’s Club rests with Andy Murray — and the Wimbledon champion has an extra incentive to deliver after two sharp volleys in his direction. The Scot’s decision to appoint a female coach in Amelie Mauresmo drew a sly dig from Australian Marinko Matosevic, while Murray’s practice colleague on Tuesday, Aljaz Bedene, came under fire over his attempt to play Davis Cup for Britain. On Murray’s new coaching set-up with Mauresmo, Bosnia-born Matosevic, who beat Marin Cilic  6-4, 6-4, said: ‘For me, I couldn’t (have a female coach) since I don’t think that highly of the women’s game.

Got to be politically correct. So, yeah, someone’s got to give it a go, but it won’t be me.’ As for Bedene, British No 2 Dan Evans said the player should have his Davis Cup ambitions blocked as he is already ‘capped’ by Slovenia, although that didn’t seem to bother Murray on Tuesday. Bedene, ranked 132 in the world, has lived in Britain since 2008 but represented Slovenia in three ties. Evans, ranked 139, said: ‘He’s played Davis Cup for a different country so I don’t think it would be right if he played Davis Cup for our country. It’s like in football, he’s been capped for another country. But I’d say I’m a better player anyway so it shouldn’t be a selection issue.’ Evans crashed out of Queen’s 6-2, 6-3 to Kevin Anderson. The South African was too strong and brutally accurate, breaking Evans in his first service game and then dominating him, serving 10 aces, compared to just two from the Briton. ‘I just didn’t get a chance to play,’ said Evans, who lasted 65 minutes. Fellow Briton James Ward lasted only two minutes longer as he fell to Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov, who was cheered to a 7-5, 6-3 victory by his girlfriend Maria Sharapova.

"Rio Ferdinand is an interviewer, . programme-maker and football expert for BT Sport . By . Rio Ferdinand . Former England captain Rio Ferdinand runs the rule over England's most threatening opponents from a group containing Italy, Uruguay and Costa Rica... and how to stop them at the World Cup. A brilliant nuisance! England's best hope of stopping Luis Suarez is to let him make his move first and then react . The man is a nuisance. A brilliant nuisance, but an absolute pain because he never stops running at you. Every time he gets the ball, he asks you questions as a defender. He has an uncanny way of playing that I’ve never seen before — trying to run the ball through you, either with a nutmeg or by kicking the ball at your legs knowing you won’t expect it, and he then picks up the ricochet. And when he’s past you and in sight of goal he pulls the trigger. Will he, won't he? Luis Suarez is facing a race against time to be fit for the World Cup following knee surgery . As defenders we always move our feet, it’s like a mantra. Feet. Position. Read the opponent. Move. Having the ball kicked at your feet is confusing! The way to stop him is to let him make his move and, aware he’ll perhaps try to knock it past, take it away. But it’s not easy. He’s a livewire, a fan of the feint and shot, and dangerous from many positions. As a defender, I’d normally be  25-30 yards away from Pirlo’s sphere of operations as the heartbeat of his club and country. But having faced him and watched him up close for many years, I know he can put the ball on a sixpence from anywhere. Italy's heartbeat: Andrea Pirlo's can be stopped by sitting on him and not allowing him to to distribute the ball . I’m always thinking of the space behind me when he’s on the field because if the opposition have a runner down the channels — Mario Balotelli for Italy, for example, who gave England the runaround at Euro 2012 — then the runner is Pirlo’s moving target. And he rarely misses. Pirlo is awesomely good and can slice you open with a kick. From 50 yards he can send a killer ball behind a defence. That combination of a runner in behind and the laser ball are a nightmare to defend. So how do you stop him? You sit on him! You stop him getting the ball or block him distributing it. Easier said than done. Left-footed Berbatov: England should not take Costa Rica forward Bryan Ruiz for granted in Brazil . There’s a truism of no easy games in football and that’s never more true than the World Cup. So England can’t take anything for granted against Costa Rica and their major threat, if firing, will be Ruiz. He’s undoubtedly talented, a left-footed Berbatov almost. Great technique and stronger than he looks.","Rio Ferdinand runs the rule over England's World Cup Group D opponents .
