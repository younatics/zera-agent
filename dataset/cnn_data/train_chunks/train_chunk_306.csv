"New York (CNN) -- Certain groups of die-hard fans are protective of the characters they hold on a pedestal. ""Star Trek"" has its Trekkies and ""Star Wars"" has the Jedi religion. Sherlock Holmes has the Sherlockians, scholars of the canon of books and short stories written by author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Many Sherlockians are members of the invitation-only literary society, The Baker Street Irregulars. Group members have historically been critical of on-screen adaptations of their beloved consulting detective and his faithful sidekick, Dr. John Watson. While they, by nature of their adoration, saw flaws in the Guy Ritchie ""Sherlock Holmes,"" which opened in theaters Friday, the consensus among these experts was that the film is a fun -- and even occasionally faithful -- romp through Sherlock lore that the author himself would have enjoyed. ""I liked it a lot more than I thought I would,"" said Andrew Peck, a United States magistrate judge. ""What I particularly liked was the Holmes-Watson relationship. The movie really showed Watson as a trusted companion to Holmes, coming to Holmes' aid in times of need. The Watson of the books is a military man who played rugby and sports in college. He is tough. He is observant on his own and Holmes wants him around, not as a bumbling fool but as a trusted aide."" Watson has historically been portrayed in films as a bumbling sidekick, most famously by British actor Nigel Bruce in a series of films from the 1940s. But director Ritchie's imagining of Watson is as the quick-footed, sharpshooting contemporary of Holmes, with a rapier-sharp wit that can match the detective in the tongue-lashing department. ""The movie did an excellent job in portraying the relationship between the two. The actors work well together, as did Holmes and Watson. The movie shows Watson as intelligent, able to be a good assistant; Watson, the doctor, concerned about his friend's well-being; and it shows his reasonable frustration with his friend's often thoughtless ways,"" said Julia Carlson Rosenblatt, a Baker Street Irregular since 1981 and co-author of ""Dining With Sherlock Holmes."" Doubleday editor Christopher Morley founded the Irregulars in 1934. The group has included mystery writers Rex Stout and Anthony Boucher and science fiction writer Isaac Asimov. Honorary members have included presidents Harry S. Truman and Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The plot of the new Sherlock Holmes movie, starring Robert Downey Jr., as Holmes and Jude Law as Watson, isn't based on an actual Conan Doyle story. The action centers on ritualistic murders and black magic, all leading to a case that has all of London in danger. Peck saw ""Sherlock Holmes"" at an early screening of the film on Tuesday in New York with a dozen other Sherlockians. Peck has been a member of the Baker Street Irregulars for 37 years, but has been a lover of the Holmes detective stories since he was in junior high. ""Certain lines of dialogue were lifted the from the books, which we as Sherlockians enjoyed. They got laughs from the 13 folks in the theater who were familiar with the stories, while everyone else was quiet. Other than that, it was all made up except for bringing in certain character names and the supporting characters,"" Peck noted. Because they are so familiar with the entire canon of four novels and 56 short stories written by Conan Doyle, Sherlockians naturally nitpicked some minor details. For instance, in this film, Watson introduces his fiancee, Mary Morstan, to Holmes for the first time. ""But we know Watson met Mary Morstan because she came to Holmes for help in 'The Sign of Four.' Holmes already knew her,"" Peck explained. And Holmes' love interest in the film, Irene Adler, the con woman played by Rachel McAdams, was in only one of Conan Doyle's stories, ""A Scandal in Bohemia."" ""While she was called an adventuress in the story, she was not a criminal by any means, as she is portrayed in this movie,"" Peck said. Conan Doyle himself would have appreciated the newest on-screen display of his hero, says Albert Rosenblatt, a Baker Street Irregular and retired appeals court judge. ""Conan Doyle was not without a sense of humor and might have been amused by this film. He didn't care enough about Holmes to insist on canonical accuracy,"" Rosenblatt said. ""When William Gillette, working on a Holmes play, asked Doyle if it was OK for Holmes to marry, Doyle is said to have replied, 'You may marry him, or murder him, or do anything you like to him.' ""So if this portrayal is a combination of Holmes, James Bond, Indiana Jones and Spider-Man,"" he added, ""it just rolls along with the times and with the current film genre dominated by brilliant, spectacular special effects, explosions, violence, and more explosions.""","Sherlockians are serious Holmes fans; many belong to The Baker Street Irregulars .

"(CNN) -- The dark curtain rises again on the tragedy of Israel and Gaza, and the next act begins much like its forerunners. Rockets hunt humans. Bombs crush buildings. Blood spills. The dead ride in caskets through streets, and mothers wail their grief to the heavens. As Israeli reserves gather like a storm over Gaza's horizon, the added bloodshed of an incursion appears imminent, and millions watching around the world ask: . What could they hope to achieve? There is no dramatic endgame in this, but there are concrete objectives, says Israeli military analyst and columnist Ron Ben-Yishai. There are official ones and unofficial ones, short-term and long-term, that make sense for Israel, he argues. Many of them will work, concedes critical Israeli columnist Gideon Levy. But he disagrees about their wisdom. They won't cure the disease but instead feed it, he argues. Military objective No. 1 . First, the conservative government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wants to stop the rocket fire by force. And weaken the Hamas militants and other groups behind it, Ben-Yishai says. ""Erode the political clout and the ability of Hamas to act both as a political and military-terrorist movement."" Those are the official goals given by the Cabinet for the military operation named Protective Edge, he says. And they'll probably be achieved, Ben-Yishai says. ""For the short-run, no doubt,"" Levy concurs. But he also thinks Hamas will come back stronger militarily and politically. That's what happened over two years ago in operation Pillar of Defense and over five years ago in Operation Cast Lead, he says. In the latter, 1,300 Palestinians and more than a dozen Israelis died. Rockets' roots . Levy sees the rocket fire from Gaza as the boiling over of cumulative tensions. He points to the peace process initiated by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry between Israel and Palestinians. The one that broke down weeks ago. The whole time, a piece was missing from the negotiating table, he says. ""Gaza was ignored totally."" Then a litany of youth killings ignited passions on both sides. Three Jewish teens were murdered, and Israeli forces swept the West Bank for suspects, making arrests that had nothing to do with the case, Levy says. Palestinians were killed. The murder of a Palestinian teen quickly followed; his body was torched. Suspicions arose that it was revenge for the Israelis' deaths. Add to that the desperation in Gaza. The narrow strip of land is locked in on all sides, and people there live in dire poverty and deprivation. ""Gaza is today the biggest cage in the world,"" Levy says. The rocket fire is just a part of it all, he says. It's a way of Hamas pounding the table, pointing out Gaza's misery. Levy's solution to the rocket fire: Pay more attention to Gazans. Don't marginalize them. Open borders, so they can move freely. Ben-Yishai, on the other hand, believes that the peaceful approach -- that calm will be met with calm -- hasn't worked out. ""This formula is out of the game. It's not in the cards now,"" he says. The military option has become inevitable. How Iron Dome blocks rockets from Gaza, protects Israelis . Operation drill-down . Hamas militants have come back stronger after the last military operation in at least one sense, Ben-Yishai says. They have more long-range rockets. Previously, militants had to import them all from the outside. Now they can also construct them themselves. They've also buried a network of launch sites below the ground's surface. Hitting them ""is quite a job,"" Ben-Yishai says. The Israel Defense Forces will have to strike deep into those systems. But the IDF has also adapted. Its bombs have become more accurate. That also reduces collateral damage in Gaza, he says. Most who die were shooting rockets, he says. ""Those who deserve it."" It's all a vicious cycle he's seen before, Levy says. The IDF destroys the militants' capabilities; they come back stronger. ""By the next operation, they will be even better equipped,"" he says. So will the Israelis. Ground incursion . Israel has called up 30,000 reserve troops and has talked about pulling in 10,000 more, a signal that there may be a ground incursion into Gaza. Levy firmly believes it will happen, that the IDF otherwise will not be able to root out militants' rocket systems. Ben-Yishai is less certain. ""I think it is in the cards. They've not made the decision yet,"" he says of the government. Netanyahu may use aggressive rhetoric but is cautious about military decisions, he says. And so far, the government is satisfied with the operations as they have been -- only from the air thus far. The endgame . The government hopes that Protective Edge will give Israel a few years of relative peace, restore normalcy for a time, Ben-Yishai says. ""After every round of hostility ... there is a sort of lull that Israel enjoys very much,"" he says. People can think about other things and tackle other issues, like the economy. But it's not nearly worth the cost, Levy says. Droves of Palestinians will be killed, others' lives ruined. But even from a purely selfish standpoint, it's at best an empty victory. ""We will see horrible scenes,"" he says. ""The world will condemn Israel. And what comes out of it? One year of peace."" Ben-Yishai believes there is a permanent gain to be made, that repeated operations in Gaza will wear the enemy down. He hopes that the lulls between battles will get longer and longer, ""until our neighbor realizes that they cannot make us disappear. They cannot erase us from the map."" Levy thinks Gaza militants won't quit until the misery there ends. He predicts that military intervention will set the stage for the next bloodcurdling act -- and then the next. New wave of Israeli airstrikes hammers Gaza . Flare-up in Israeli-Palestinian violence: Why now? Has the Middle East crisis reached a tipping point?","Military operations in Gaza make sense for Israel, an analyst says .

"(CNN) -- A World War II-era bomb was discovered in London's Olympic Park on Monday, hours after the closing concert of a sporting competition for wounded and ill veterans sponsored by members of Britain's royal family. Although the bomb turned out to be inert and alerts were later dropped, police say it did require evacuations of residents and schools near the park, which was converted to public use after the 2012 London Olympics. The park was also the scene Sunday of the closing concert of the Invictus Games. Britain's Prince Harry founded the games. The bomb was found at the international broadcast center in the park. It wasn't immediately known how it was discovered. Unexploded ordnance is not uncommon in Great Britain, which was not only the scene of German air raids during World War II, but essentially also an enormous armed encampment, training ground and ammunition depot during World War II.

"(CNN) -- There has been much controversy about the two-game suspension the NFL handed down in July to Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice. Rice was caught on a security camera in February pulling his fiancÃ©e, Janay Palmer (now his wife, Janay Rice), unconscious from an elevator. He was charged with aggravated assault. That's right, two games. I have something to say to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. Dear Roger, . We thought you really cared. We believed you when you said you wanted to create a more welcoming NFL game for women. And all of us were touched by the compassion you showed with your Breast Cancer Awareness campaign, even though those hot pink cleats disturbingly clashed with every NFL uniform. Mr. Commissioner, you even talked endlessly about making NFL stadiums around the nation more family-friendly. And despite all the disturbing medical reports of NFL players with life-threatening concussions, you have worked tirelessly to try to convince us moms that the game remains safe for our precious sons. (I forgave you for stretching the truth past all the medical evidence on that one.) And still, we thought: Now that man really cares. What a guy. We repaid your good deeds by watching the games in record numbers, helping the league boost its television ratings. We even started turning up at stadiums around the nation and buying all those form-fitting team-branded outfits now made for women. The NFL reported earnings of more than $9 billion last year, thanks in large part to women, who make up nearly 45% of the league's fan base. So, knowing you as we do, there was no doubt that you'd send down the harshest penalty possible for Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice after he was caught on camera dragging his then-fiancee, Janay, like a rag doll out of the elevator. Surely, you, like all the rest of us, must have been appalled by Rice's actions. Roger will handle it, we thought. No way the commissioner who prides himself on being tough on players who step out of line will let this atrocious behavior go unpunished. What fools we have been. A two-game suspension? You repay our loyalty with an insult? And you expect us to accept that -- to keep on supporting your game? Not happening here. You've shown us your true face. And sadly, you, Mr. Commissioner are a fake, a fraud, a liar. Turns out you never really cared about women at all. Where is the indignation and outrage you showed the world when handing down the indefinite suspension for NFL quarterback Michael Vick in 2007 after he admitted his role in a dogfighting ring? ""Your admitted conduct is not only illegal, but also cruel and reprehensible. ... Your team, fans and the NFL have all been hurt by your actions,"" you wrote to Vick in a formal letter from the league. ""Your career, freedom and your public standing are now in the most serious jeopardy. I hope that you will be able to learn from this difficult experience and emerge from it better prepared to act responsibly and to make the kinds of choices that are expected of a conscientious and law-abiding citizen."" By your lights, it sounds like dogs are more important than women. Or perhaps you subscribe to the philosophy of my misguided colleague, sports commentator Stephen A. Smith, who raised the issue of whether Rice's wife somehow brought an ""element of provocation"" into the situation. Rightfully, Smith was suspended for a week by ESPN. But at least he has faced his critics. You, Mr. Goodell, were hiding out in your NFL ivory tower until you were forced to face the league's female fans and try to defend the indefensible. It's good to know where we stand with you now, Roger. We should have known that you were just stringing us along. Saying all the right words. Sadly, we love this game so much it was easy to look the other way. Easy to believe. But you've gone too far. It's time for us to fight back. I'm declaring week three, Sunday, September 21, 1:00 p.m. an NFL blackout day in my house. That's the game when Rice is scheduled to return to the field after serving his paltry suspension. And I'm urging every woman I know to do the same. The blackout continues until we hear your apology. You don't take 45% of your customers for granted. Because, in case you didn't know, Roger, without women watching the NFL, you lose. And we are keeping score.","Roxanne Jones: Goodell, NFL commissioner, talked good line on NFL welcoming female fans .

"(CNN) -- ""The Good Wife's"" season 6 premiere ratings weren't revelatory, but the episode sure was. Sunday brought the return of Julianna Margulies' Alicia Florrick in an episode called ""The Line,"" which saw an arresting unexpected twist. After the loss of Josh Charles' Will Gardner last season, it would've been reasonable for ""The Good Wife"" to come back mild; give its viewers' heart rates a little rest. No such luck. Viewers were instead treated to the arrest of Matt Czuchry's Cary for allegedly assisting Chicago drug dealer Lemond Bishop in transporting narcotics. Those watching at home were stunned, and, according to Czuchry, the arrest came as a surprise to him, too. ""It was certainly an unexpected storyline,"" the actor told The Hollywood Reporter. ""When I went into wardrobe and saw it was a prison uniform that I needed to try on, I told my costume designers, 'That's not a suit ...'"" We hope Czuchry's prison uniform is comfortable, because the actor added this plot won't neatly tie up anytime soon. ""It's not a storyline that's going to go away. We're going to see how it affects Cary personally and professionally and how it affects everyone at the firm and on the show,"" the actor said to The Hollywood Reporter. ""What the state's attorney's office is doing in terms of the case is going to be a huge part of season 6. Whether that means Cary is going to be in jail or out of jail I can't say, but I can say that that particular storyline is going to continue. You will learn more about Cary and Bishop's relationship. We will touch on a lot of different issues that come from that storyline. It is less about Cary being in jail and more about him having been arrested."" Unfortunately, the ratings didn't quite repay ""The Good Wife"" for its storytelling chutzpah, as the season 6 opener was slightly down with a 1.3 rating in the advertiser-valued 18-49 adult demographic; last year's premiere received a 1.5 rating. In total viewers, the episode drew nearly 10 million. By comparison, CBS' new series, the Tea Leoni-starring ""Madam Secretary,"" had a 2.0 in the adult demo, with 14.7 million tuning in. That's a promising start for the freshman program, which has earned some mixed reviews from critics. Leoni stars as Elizabeth McCord, a professor and former CIA agent who's abruptly appointed to the position of Secretary of State after the current one dies. McCord's also married and a mom, so part of the background for ""Madam Secretary's"" stories are the reality of balancing work and home life. So far, not so bad: The Washington Post thought the pilot was ""taut and well-structured,"" aided by a ""calm, cool and wry performance"" from Leoni. The Los Angeles Times called the series a ""front-runner"" this fall TV season, thanks to its sharp writing ""and formidable cast."" The A.V. Club too saw potential, acknowledging that ""Madam Secretary is not perfect, but it could be."" But others have taken a less optimistic view. For Slate, the problem with ""Madam Secretary"" is that it's ""just really, really dull, as if someone tried to make a counterweight to 'Scandal' with only the boring parts."" Variety, which calls ""Madam Secretary"" a ""slightly more simple-minded return to 'The West Wing,'"" is curious to see how the series will use its stronger selling points. The show, the trade paper says, ""has enough interesting pieces ... to have significant potential."" It's just that Sunday's premiere ""doesn't bode particularly well for being able to maximize those assets ... as they say in diplomatic circles, the devil is in the details.""","""The Good Wife"" and ""Madam Secretary"" premiered Sunday on CBS .

"(CNN) -- The height of luxury -- or a vulgar monstrosity? To its owner, this 15-meter, Lamborghini-inspired speedboat is the apex of nautical engineering. A sleek, innovative, gutsy vessel worthy of its $1.1 million price tag. But others disagree. When Gino Gargiulo turned up at the Miami Boat Show with his banana-yellow beauties in tow -- the boat and the $750,000 car it resembles -- a small crowd quickly gathered around. ""This is the best boat you can buy -- it's the Lamborghini of boats,"" says the 48-year-old automobile and restaurant mogul from Miami, Florida. ""The response we've had ... letters, emails. If you do a Google search today there are 14,000 pages on it already -- and the boat's never even been in the water."" However, not everyone is impressed by the idea of a high-performance sports car dressed up as a superyacht. To Quentin Willson, former presenter of BBC TV show ""Top Gear,"" the Lamborghini boat is a tasteless display of wealth that screams: ""I'm rich and bored."" Willson quickly moves into fourth gear with his analysis. ""And that's really sad. Anybody who's got that amount of money that they need to go and commission a special boat to keep them entertained -- I think it's nuts,"" he says. ""The key with these people is they want to be different, and they want to be separate, and they want to be distinctive -- and that impulse throws good taste, and reason, and rationale out the window."" Rags to riches . What really sets Gargiulo apart is not his wealth or supercar yachts -- it's the fact that more than 25 years ago he was penniless and living on the streets of New York. ""I was a drug addict, on cocaine and crack,"" says the father-of-one, who today owns a truck repair company, a car paintwork group, and a chain of hamburger restaurants. ""I lived in a halfway house for about a year. I really started with nothing and no help. And probably in fear of ever going back there, it's kept me motivated to this day. ""I work really hard, I make a good living, and all the things I didn't have for a long time, well now I can do it."" Billionaire bling . With his supercar yacht he has done it -- and then some. ""Like anybody that likes expensive things, it's definitely an ego thing,"" says Gargiulo, who also commissioned a Mercedes-style vessel in 2007. ""Maybe it's partially boredom. I'm one of those people that always has to have to have a project -- and I've been thinking about doing the Lamborghini boat for years."" The flashy vessel's engine package costs $400,000, a ""homage"" to his beloved Lamborghini car -- one of two he owns. Gargiulo is not the only one with an ego in overdrive, by the sounds of it. ""The people that own these boats, already own the vehicles,"" says Larry Goldman, owner of Xtremepowerboats, which as well as the Lamborghini and Mercedes has also sold Ferrari and Corvette-inspired yachts to other millionaires. ""Nobody wants a boat to resemble a car that they can't afford."" Daring design . Once someone decides they want a supercar yacht, it's up to engineers at Marine Technology Inc. to bring it to life, drawing up designs that take the most iconic features of the luxury automobile and transferring them to a working boat, capable of traveling 300 kilometers per hour. ""In the case of the Lamborghini, one of the most noticeable and sought-after features is the beautiful carbon-fiber scoops on the side of the car,"" says Goldman. ""They're quite pronounced and we wanted to make sure we used them in the design -- along with the exotic taillights and headlights, which are different to a normal car."" Sit in the driver's seat and the plush leather interior could easily be mistaken for the four-wheeled variety. The distinctive yellow paintwork is also identical, and seeing the two super vehicles together is a bit like witnessing a surreal Lamborghini festival for enthusiasts. A question of taste . There's no denying this is a rare and expensive yacht. But it's not for Willson. ""If I was wealthy enough to go down the boat route, I would buy myself a lovely old period Riva motorboat,"" he says, referring to the vintage Italian wooden vessel. ""When you start making bright yellow Lamborghini speedboats, I think it means you are firmly detached from reality,"" he says by phone, having just driven through London in his own Mercedes SLS -- a supercar worth Â£175,000 ($290,000) and capable of doing 300 kph. While Wilson ponders the meaning of taste, Gargiulo is getting his kicks from the adrenalin of driving one of these supercar yachts -- ""Like nothing else in the world,"" is how he puts it. When he first took his Mercedes version on the water, he felt like he was flying. ""I'm sure my wife Renea would prefer if I put a lot more money in the bank,"" he says. ""But this is just me."" ""I make a good living, I give to charity, and I like buying these kinds of things."" Learn: Celebrity architect's space-age superyacht .

"CEBU, Philippines (CNN) -- Amid the tropical heat of a Philippine prison, convicted murderers, rapists and drug dealers on Saturday paid tribute to Michael Jackson with a reprise of their YouTube dance hit, ""Thriller."" Inmates at the prison in Cebu perform their tribute to Michael Jackson Saturday. A rendition of Jackson's 1980s smash hit by prisoners at the Cebu Detention and Rehabilitation Center in the central Philippines garnered more than 24 million views since 2007, when prison supervisor Byron Garcia first uploaded it to the video-sharing Web site. The prison has since posted other dance videos, including performances to Van Halen's ""Jump,"" Queen's ""Radio Ga Ga,"" and Phil Oakey and Giorgio Moroder's ""Together in Electric Dreams."" Jackson, known as the ""King of Pop,"" died Thursday in Los Angeles, less than two weeks shy of the first in a series of comeback concerts in London, England. When he heard the news, Garcia, himself a fan of the 50-year-old pop icon, organized a free tribute performance by inmates for local people in the prison courtyard. Dancing was introduced at the prison in 2007, as a means of rehabilitating prisoners at a facility once notorious for its gang problem.  Watch the prisoners dance » . Every able-bodied prisoner must dance. If they refuse, they lose privileges, mostly conjugal visits. According to Garcia, the dancing occupies up to five hours a day. However he rejected claims he's abusing the prisoners' rights by forcing them to dance so many hours a day. He said it gives them a renewed sense of worth and confidence, breaking them of their violent ways. He is convinced his prison is a model for prison authorities everywhere, an example of how to crack the plague of violent prison gangs. ""It brought back their self esteem. We have happy inmates now -- we don't want to go back to the old jail where we had mad, sad inmates,"" he said. In searing temperatures, 1,400 men in bright orange tracksuits performed the 15-minute ""Thriller"" routine perfectly. They rehearsed for 10 hours the previous day, finally stopping at 3 a.m. to rest ahead of the show. The superbly-choreographed moves, energy and obvious enthusiasm of the prisoners had the audience -- swelled by journalists from around the world -- captivated the audience. Several inmates even invited people from the crowd to dance with them. ""I never thought I would ever find myself dancing with a prisoner,"" one excited local said. A local journalist even described the performance as Asia's best way of paying tribute to Jackson. Garcia, who says the prison has witnessed no violence in three years, paid tribute to the performers. ""I'm so proud of them,"" he said. ""They got the dance exactly right."" Although it was ""probably wishful thinking,"" he added that he had actually wanted Michael Jackson to come to Cebu to dance and play the role himself. ""Now it's not going to happen,"" he said mournfully. Convicted robber Mavin Cabido, 23, said: ""I feel so sad as we idolize him really. The moonwalk is my favorite -- I like that.""","Their 2007 rendition of ""Thriller"" has attracted 24 million views on YouTube .

"(Fast Company) -- Apple bet big on the App Store -- and 350,000 apps later, competitors are struggling to catch up. Now, there's Google's Android Market, BlackBerry's App World, HP's Palm App Catalog, and Microsoft's Apps Marketplace. But while Apple still leads the pack with an astonishing 82.7% market share, the app race is far from over. According to a new report by Forrester Research, the app market will explode to a $38 billion industry by 2015, riding the huge growth in popularity of mobile devices from smartphones to tablets to whatever Apple dreams up next. In 2010, apps on these devices pulled in $1.7 billion globally, meaning the market will blossom exponentially in the coming years. ""The explosion of app development that started on the iPhone only scratches the surface of what's about to emerge,"" the report says. What's more, the average cost of paid apps is only $2.43, with just 33% of smartphone users downloading apps on a monthly basis, says Forrester. Once more smartphones from Google, Microsoft, and RIM roll out, and more tablets from Motorola and Samsung, app sales and volume will only increase. The question now is whether any of those competitors will be able to catch up to Apple by 2015, or whether they'll only create a fractured marketplace. And if Apple were able to retain just a 50% market share in the coming years, it'd be pulling in close to $20 billion from app sales -- roughly a third of its current total annual revenues.

"(CNN) -- Three Afghan National Army soldiers, who were in Massachusetts for training, have gone missing after a trip to a shopping mall, authorities said. It's the second time in a week that Afghan security trainees in the United States have disappeared. The three soldiers do not appear to pose any threat to the public, the Massachusetts National Guard said. Earlier this month, two Afghan police officers training with the DEA wandered off during a sightseeing trip to Georgetown, CNN affiliate WJLA reported. They decided they wanted to stay in the United States, but authorities found them and sent them home. The three men currently missing in Massachusetts are Afghanistan National Army Soldiers Maj. Jan Mohammad Arash, Cpt. Mohammad Nasir Askarzada, and Cpt. Noorullah Aminyar. They arrived in the United States on September 11 for Exercise Regional Cooperation, an annual event, the guard said, and were quartered at Joint Base Cape Cod. The three were reported missing by base security late Saturday and were last seen at a Cape Cod mall in Hyannis. ""Base and exercise officials are working with local police and state authorities to locate the three Afghans,"" the guard said. Troops from six nations are participating in the exercise, which runs through Wednesday and will go on as scheduled, the guard said. Roughly a dozen Afghan soldiers are still participating.

"Washington (CNN) -- Democrats were making an election-year pitch to women on Friday, mindful of their past advantage among the voting bloc and hoping to convince enough women to cast ballots for their candidates in November's mid-term contests. Without strong turnout and support from women, Democrats stand little chance of keeping control of the Senate -- the party's top priority this year. The biggest draw at the Democrats' Women's Leadership Forum in Washington was Hillary Clinton, their leading 2016 potential presidential contender and, in the minds of some Democrats, a potential boost to mid-term candidates. President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden also were on the event's roster. ""We have fought for families, for moms and dads and kids and the values that hold us all together,"" Clinton said during her midday speech, which was warmly received by the room of party activists. Women have provided Democrats a boost in recent elections, including in 2012, when 55% voted for Obama in that year's presidential contest. But as Obama's poll numbers have slid, so, too, has his support among women. The most recent CNN survey of Obama's popularity showed 55% of women disapproved of how Obama is handling his job -- the same percentage that voted for him in 2012. That disapproval rate was on par with the figure for men. On pressing issues including terrorism, the economy and Ukraine, more women than men disapprove of how Obama's doing his job. Those figures worry Democrats, whose prospects in this year's contests are closely pinned to voters' perception of Obama. Those anxieties have led to scant invites for Obama on the campaign trail. Less worrisome in the mind of some party operatives is Clinton, who's been enlisted to stump for candidates in several states ahead of the November 4 vote. On Friday, she said the congressional and gubernatorial contests were just as important as the higher-profile presidential race she's currently considering. ""I know they might not be as glamorous as presidential elections,"" Clinton said of midterms, but they're nonetheless ""crucial for our country's future."" Listing candidates such as gubernatorial hopefuls Mary Burke (Wisconsin) and Wendy Davis (Texas), Clinton said women candidates ""give me hope"" for the future of keeping issues like pay equity and the minimum wage at the fore. ""We have fought for families, for moms and dads and kids and the values that hold us all together,"" she said. ""So don't let anyone dismiss what you're doing here today as women's work. Don't let anyone send you back to the sidelines."" Earlier, Biden touted his own record advocating for stricter laws to punish violence against women, and claimed modern-day Republicans weren't upholding their party's history. ""It wasn't Democrats involved. Republicans were the sponsors of raises in the minimum wage. I could go on and on. So I'm not joking. This is not your father's Republican Party,"" he said. Republicans countered by claiming Democrats were only interested in ""pointing fingers."" ""Every day we are talking to women about the issues we all care about -- empowering women at work and at home, creating good paying jobs, building the economy, increasing workplace flexibility, addressing workplace discrimination and modernizing job training,"" said GOP spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski.","Top Democrats speak at Women's Leadership Forum .

"(CNN) -- For a while, it seemed that the threat from ISIS was limited to sparsely populated desert regions in the Middle East. Through brutal tactics and persecution of minorities, the Sunni extremist group brought slaughter and chaos to large areas of Syria and Iraq. But its merciless efforts to establish its version of an Islamic caliphate unsettled the wider region, prompting U.S. airstrikes aimed at stemming its advance. The Islamic militant group has responded by beheading three of its Western hostages in recent weeks, ratcheting up the crisis. It has also amped up the rhetoric, threatening attacks on the United States and its allies. On Monday, several countries quickly rejected the threats, which were made in an audio recording from an ISIS leader who urged attacks on civilians in the United States and other Western nations. The situation underscores the question of what ISIS hopes to gain through the intensifying conflict with the United States and its allies. What has ISIS been saying about the U.S.? ISIS, which calls itself the ""Islamic State,"" has been ramping up its threats against the United States and the West for months. The extremist group publicly warned of ""direct confrontation"" with the U.S. as far back as January, according to the National Counterterrorism Center. ISIS has also ""repeatedly taunted Americans,"" the center said, notably during the recent videotaped executions of journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff. The killings of Foley and Sotloff took place after the U.S. military began airstrikes against ISIS positions in Iraq to help Kurdish and Iraqi forces beat back the militants' rapid advance. President Obama has since announced his anti-ISIS strategy, which is expected to involve expanding the airstrikes into the chaotic Syrian battle zone. The U.S. has also been working to build up a coalition of countries to help counter the threat from ISIS, which is also known as ISIL. Why is ISIS so eager to pick a fight with America? This summer, ISIS declared the establishment of a ""caliphate,"" an Islamic state stretching across the territory it has conquered. A former ISIS fighter told CNN this month that the group's main aim is ""to establish an Islamic state that will encompass the Arab world."" ""And after that, we go to other countries,"" the man said in an interview in Turkey. With that goal in mind, taunting and antagonizing the world's foremost military power may not seem like the wisest way for ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to expand and consolidate his territory in the Middle East. But analysts say that for the group to be seen around the world as locked in battle with the U.S. is an effective means of rallying more fighters to ISIS' banner. ""For al-Baghdadi, fighting America and its coalition of 40 countries is a badge of honor, a powerful recruiting tool. It is proof that he and his organization have become the leaders of global jihad, toppling al Qaeda, their rival in that contest,"" world affairs columnist Frida Ghitis wrote in a commentary for CNN. Will it work? With the U.S. military carrying out strikes against ISIS forces, the extremist group is able to exploit the situation for propaganda purposes. The group said the executions of Foley and Sotloff were in response to the American airstrikes in Iraq. ""I'm back, Obama, and I'm back because of your arrogant foreign policy towards the Islamic State,"" the executioner says in the video of Sotloff's beheading. ""Just as your missiles continue to strike our people, our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people."" The beheadings further intensified attention on ISIS and its efforts to impose its heavy-handed rule on parts of Iraq and Syria. U.S. intelligence officials estimate that more than 2,000 Europeans and more than 100 Americans have flocked Syria to fight with extremist groups there. They say it's unclear precisely how many of them have joined ISIS. But the strategy could backfire. ""ISIS is gambling that drawing America and the West into the fight will make it stronger, but if the West is strategic and smart, this move will prove to be ISIS' worst mistake,"" said Ghitis. What kind of threat does ISIS pose to the U.S.? U.S. officials say that ISIS fighters aren't a direct threat to the U.S. homeland at the moment. ""At this point, we have no information that ISIL is plotting an attack inside the United States,"" Matthew Olsen, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, said last week in testimony to Congress. The dangers, officials say, are to U.S. personnel and infrastructure in Iraq -- and from militants with U.S. or other Western passports potentially returning home and staging attacks. ""What really worries American counterterrorism officials is that ISIS will prioritize launching attacks against the United States, will train Western recruits in bomb-making and send them back,"" said CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank. The suspect in the deadly shooting at Belgium's Jewish Museum in May recently spent a year in Syria and is a radicalized Islamist, according to French officials. Prosecutors say that when police arrested the French citizen, they also seized a Kalashnikov rifle wrapped in a flag bearing the ISIS insignia. What about the risk of homegrown attacks? That's what security analysts say is cause for concern -- and what ISIS appears to be urging in its new audio message. Attacks by homegrown terrorists aren't new. In recent years, the United States has experienced the horror of the Boston Marathon bombings and the Fort Hood shooting. Al Qaeda has long urged individuals in the West to mount their own attacks, providing instructions on matters like bomb-making in its magazine, Inspire. The Boston marathon bombers used pressure cooker devices they apparently learned to make online. The National Counterterrorism Center says homegrown violent extremists are ""the most likely immediate threat to the homeland."" It estimates that the level of activity of such extremists has remained consistent over the past few years, but that ISIS' influence could start to play a role. ""We remain mindful of the possibility that an ISIL-sympathizer could conduct a limited, self-directed attack here at home with no warning,"" the center says. Officials say they are particularly concerned about ISIS' skillful use of propaganda, particularly on social media, to reach an audience in the West. Have there already been any cases of ISIS-inspired attackers in the West? U.S. authorities have alleged that a man who owns an upstate New York food store funded ISIS, tried to send jihadists to Syria and plotted to kill U.S. troops who had served in Iraq. Mufid A. Elfgeeh, 30, was arrested on May 31, though federal officials didn't outline the case against him until last week. Elfgeeh, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Yemen, has pleaded not guilty to the charges, which include trying ""to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization"" and attempting to kill officers and employees of the United States. In Australia, whose government has pledged combat aircraft and military advisers to the fight against ISIS, authorities carried out a large-scale anti-terrorism operation last week. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said that an Australian high up in ISIS had been calling on his networks in Australia to carry out ""demonstration killings."" Australian media reported that the alleged assailants planned to kidnap a member of the public, behead the victim and then drape him or her in an ISIS flag. Authorities declined to give details about the threat, citing an ongoing operation. Was the U.S. slow to grasp the scale of the ISIS menace? While ISIS has been taunting the United States for months -- including publishing images of American soldiers engulfed in flames in its online magazine -- some critics have suggested Obama initially underestimated the extremist group. In particular, the President's comments to The New Yorker in January have been singled out. ""The analogy we use around here sometimes, and I think is accurate, is if a J.V. team puts on Lakers uniforms, that doesn't make them Kobe Bryant,"" Obama told the magazine. Months later, Obama ordered airstrikes against the group, which he has described as a ""cancer."" His defense secretary, Chuck Hagel, said last month the threat from ISIS was ""beyond anything we have seen."" But senior administration officials have defended Obama's earlier characterization of the extremists. ""The President was right,"" Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken told CNN last month. ""They did not pose a threat like al Qaeda central to us in the homeland.""","Fighting the U.S. is ""a badge of honor"" that helps ISIS recruitment, commentator says .

"(CNN) -- Scottish singing sensation Susan Boyle says she was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome last year, according to a report in Sunday's editions of The Observer newspaper. The singer told The Observer that she went to a specialist in Scotland because she thought she had a more serious condition than the diagnosis she had received when she was a child. ""I was told I had brain damage. I always knew it was an unfair label,"" she said. ""Now I have a clearer understanding of what's wrong and I feel relieved and a bit more relaxed about myself."" With autism, no longer invisible . Boyle became famous overnight after her audition for ""Britain's Got Talent"" in 2009 amazed people around the world who saw it on the show and on the Internet, . Asperger's syndrome, a developmental disorder that is a form of autism, is characterized by poor social skills, physical clumsiness, and narrowly focused interests, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health. I have Asperger's; I am just like you . Boyle, 52, said she hoped revealing her Asperger's diagnosis will lead people to understand and treat her better. She said it was important for her to have a support team. ""I am not strong on my own. When I have the support of people around me I am fine,"" she said. Boyle recently released her fifth studio album, a collection of Christmas recordings.

"(CNN) -- It cost his newspaper a thumping $1.6 million in legal costs. He was the subject of vilification from both cycling fans and officials -- not to mention from a man who had become a global sporting icon. But not once did David Walsh waver in his quest to unveil the truth about Lance Armstrong and his doping lies -- despite the almost insurmountable obstacles placed in his way. ""People find this strange, but for me it was the time of my life,"" Walsh told CNN's Changing Gear series in an interview before the start of the Tour de France. ""I loved it. I thought 'This was journalism, this was what our game was about' -- asking questions that people didn't want to answer was actually the life blood of journalism for me at that time."" The award-winning Sunday Times journalist spent 13 long and sometimes lonely years pursuing Armstrong. Labeled a ""Little Troll"" by the American, Walsh was finally vindicated when the disgraced cyclist confessed earlier this year. It was Walsh's finest hour and he even gained an apology from Armstrong during the course of the Texan's televised interview with Oprah Winfrey earlier this year. No elation . But the 58-year-old Irishman did not feel any sense of real elation -- only the satisfaction of a job well done. ""For me, it wasn't a conclusion that was thrilling, or exciting, or interesting -- it was the chase,"" said Walsh. ""I've used the expression that the hunt was better than the kill, and it very much was. I loved getting new information about Armstrong."" Back in 1999, when the world was in thrall to the cancer survivor after Armstrong's remarkable comeback to win the Tour de France that year, Walsh was immediately skeptical. ""It was perfectly obvious to anybody with half a brain that Armstrong was cheating,"" said Walsh. ""We were told this is a clean Tour, but it was the fastest in history -- completely illogical!"" Armstrong's treatment of the French rider Christophe Bassons, who was renowned for his anti-doping stance, only served to further raise Walsh's suspicions. Bullying tactics . ""I mean, Armstrong bullied him, most of the peloton bullied him and I thought: 'If you were anti-doping, that's not how you would treat somebody who clearly was riding clean.'"" It was the start of a crusade to uncover the truth, though at first nobody wanted to listen. In the aftermath of the 1998 Tour de France -- blighted by doping, with police raiding teams to find illegal products -- cycling had been desperate for a good news story and was prepared, in Walsh's words, to ""suspend disbelief."" ""An American guy comes from Texas, single-parent family, he's come through life-threatening cancer, he's in the lead,"" explained Walsh. ""It's a story that could take the Tour de France from its knees and put it standing up again and the race organizers embraced that."" As Armstrong's winning run continued -- eventually to total an unprecedented seven Tour wins in a row -- so in Walsh's view the American's web of deceit grew and he alleges others were complicit in the cover up. Walsh was determined to publish his version of events and when LA (Lance Armstrong) Confidential hit the bookshelves in 2004 and a story based on it was published in the Sunday Times, the libel suits and the threats intensified. Singled out . Walsh was at an explosive Tour media conference later that year and Armstrong, when inevitably asked about the book, singled him out, as the journalist vividly recalls. Armstrong said: ""Well as the esteemed author is here, I will answer this. ""And then he said 'Extraordinary allegations, no, extraordinary accusations must be followed by extraordinary proof.' Everybody thought that was a great one-liner."" Walsh had based his book on interviews with Betsy Andreu, the wife of cyclist Frankie Andreu, a former teammate of Armstrong, Emma O'Reilly, who had acted as personal masseuse for the now disgraced cyclist, and a former teammate from the 1990's, Steven Swart. When details of the systematic doping carried out by Armstrong and his team finally emerged in a report by the United States Anti Doping Agency (USADA) in 2012, it vindicated the whistleblowers' stance -- as well as Walsh and his co-author Frenchman Pierre Ballester. But back in 2004, with Armstrong at the peak of his fame, it was inevitable he would challenge such damaging revelations to protect his reputation. Libel action . The Sunday Times stood by their man and his story, but when libel action in the UK courts was commenced by the litigious Armstrong, they knew the outcome would probably be in the American's favor. Walsh recognized the seriousness of the situation, but admitted his judgment became clouded. ""I'm there saying 'Well I don't care, I just want this stuff out there.' ""And I wasn't seeing reason to be honest. I would have been a bit of a nightmare from the legal department's point of view and they were right. ""It did cost the Sunday Times a million pounds, but the newspaper were tremendously supportive as was my sports editor,"" added Walsh, referring to the out-of-court settlement reached with Armstrong in 2006. By then the Texan had retired from the sport for the first time, though the rumors would not go away. Ultimate responsibility . Walsh believes that cycling's governing body -- the International Cycling Union -- bears a heavy responsibility for not cleaning up its own sport in the face of overwhelming evidence of doping, not just by Armstrong but other leading riders. He is heavily critical of its chiefs past and present, Hein Vergruggen, who resigned in 2005 to be replaced by Pat McQuaid. ""They were the people whose ultimate responsibility it was to ensure that the riders riding clean were protected. They didn't do their job,"" said Walsh. ""McQuaid said he was very anti-doping, but he didn't want to find out the truth about Lance Armstrong. He wanted basically, to sweep it under the carpet, and in my opinion, his organization now cannot have any credibility as long as he's president."" Walsh's fellow Irishman McQuiad has a different perspective. ""Hindsight is an exact science and hindsight is 20-20 vision,"" McQuaid told CNN as part of the Changing Gear series. ""Of course you would do things differently but that doesn't mean that I regret anything that I did. ""Many, many federations around the world told me that under no circumstances should I contemplate resigning,"" added McQuaid defiantly. McQuaid is being challenged for the top job at the UCI by British Cycling's Brian Cookson, and Walsh, while not specifically backing any candidate, is convinced a change is urgently needed. ""I have been saying this since the whole controversy unfolded -- the people who were in charge during this fiasco, shouldn't still be there. ""If cycling could find a credible candidate within its own ranks to take over from Pat, it would immediately change the perception of the UCI and people would say 'You know what? Let's give this new guy a chance. ""And let him reassure us that anti-doping really is going to be the number one item on the agenda."" Ringleader . Armstrong came out of retirement in 2009 to ride for the Astana team and finished third in that year's Tour de France. He raced two more years with Team RadioShack with diminishing success before quitting in early 2011. By then he was the subject of a U.S. federal investigation into doping allegations and more former teammates, notably Tyler Hamilton and Floyd Landis, came forward to specifically implicate the Texan as the ringleader. Once again, Walsh had been ahead of the game, having published From Lance to Landis: Inside the American Doping Controversy at the Tour de France in 2007. The federal case against Armstrong was eventually dropped, but the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency persisted in its investigations. Grilling his former teammates and other close connections, the USADA formally charged Armstrong in June 2012 with using illicit performance-enhancing drugs in ""the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen."" Walsh, who has won a string of press awards, was finally vindicated as he recounts in his book Seven Deadly Sins: My Pursuit of Lance Armstrong. New era . For the first time since 2004, Walsh will cover the Tour de France after Britain's Team Sky Cycling team, who won the Tour last year with Bradley Wiggins, gave the journalist exclusive behind the scenes access to the 2013 race. ""I'm really looking forward to it, but I'm looking forward to it because I feel that the Armstrong era has been dealt with and we can start again,"" said the Irishman. ""We can start tentatively believing in some of what we see, and that's why I'm back."" Not that Walsh believes the doping culture in cycling has been completely eradicated and points to last year's race where Luxembourg's Frank Schleck fell foul of the testers. ""The one certainty is that Frank Schleck wasn't the only guy who doped in last year's Tour de France,"" said Walsh. ""That's absolutely certain. ""Nobody of sane mind would believe that the people who get caught are the only people who dope."" Walsh has spent four weeks in total with Team Sky as they prepared for this year's Tour where Chris Froome, second last year to Wiggins, who will be absent this time, is regarded the favorite. The journalist has had to soak up some criticism on Twitter that he has become a ""PR agency for Sky"" but Walsh remains unabashed. ""They say they're clean. I've seen nothing to make me suspicious that they're telling a lie when they say they're clean, though that doesn't mean that things couldn't be happening behind my back. ""The conclusion I've come to given the time I've spent with them is that they certainly don't have an organized doping program within the team.""","Irish journalist David Walsh spent over a decade pursuing Lance Armstrong .

"Barcelona, Spain (CNN) -- In Barcelona, you'll find a contemporary Olympic stadium, ancient Roman columns and chimneys that look like space aliens. The capital of the Spanish region of Catalonia has reinvented itself a number of times. But it seems to hold a special place for both its medieval and moderniste sides. While planning my first visit to the city, I was certain I would be most interested in exploring the Ciutat Vella, Barcelona's old city, with its narrow streets and centuries-old churches. But I also had every intention to follow the tourist checklist, and visit a few of the Catalan modernist buildings for which the city is well known. Modernisme, or Catalan modernism, is a cultural movement that took hold in Barcelona in the late 1800s, encompassing Art Nouveau and other artistic styles. Its followers embraced asymmetry, bright colors and curving lines. But from pictures I saw before my trip, the style didn't seem nearly as appealing as Barcelona's medieval masterpieces. The old city was enchanting, especially the Barri Gotic, or gothic quarter. Local school kids' voices echoed in an ancient square, as my husband and I meandered through a maze of cobblestone streets, walled with medieval palaces and churches. There are antique shops, where collectors can find anything from teacups to old posters, and on the weekends local artists hawk their wares at open-air markets in some of the larger squares. There are plenty of restaurants and cafes for tapas, sangria and people-watching. Tourists pass with their noses in guidebooks, while locals walk quickly, seemingly unaware of the splendor surrounding them. If the old city made us feel a bit claustrophobic, a stroll up Passeig de Gracia was the cure. The wide street is the main boulevard leading through L'Eixample, the extension to the city built in the mid-1800s. In the midst of chic shops and restaurants are some breathtaking examples of Catalan modernist architecture. L'Eixample was built as Barcelona was starting to thrive as an economic center in a way it hadn't since the Middle Ages. The showy moderniste style took shape as successful entrepreneurs commissioned elaborate villas. Architects employed contemporary materials like glass, ceramic and iron, but also drew inspiration from Romanesque and Catalan Gothic styles. I learned to appreciate Catalan modernism as soon as I caught sight of Casa Batllo, a large home designed by Antoni Gaudi, perhaps the most famous moderniste architect. Its colorful exterior sparkles with bits of broken glass, the curving rooftop is covered in a rainbow of scales, and the rounded balconies seem to be shaped out of bone. Gaudi was a pioneer of Catalan modernism. He drew inspiration from nature, and his distinctive style featured bold shapes and colors. He created many of Barcelona's greatest tourist attractions, including another eye-catching work on Passeig de Gracia, a large apartment building called Casa Mila. Its undulating exterior is made of natural-colored stone, and doesn't feature a single straight line. The one-of-a-kind façade is accented with twisting iron balconies. But the most interesting feature has to be the rooftop -- a surreal landscape of peaks and valleys, where tourists pose for photos in front of chimneys that look like something between masked warriors and space aliens. Even the tiles that make up the sidewalks on Passeig de Gracia feature a reproduction of a swirling design by Gaudi. The rounded street benches and ornate iron lampposts keep with the theme. A study in contrasts . A trip to Barcelona wouldn't be complete without visiting its array of churches. The city's houses of worship capture both the medieval and Catalan modernist styles. Towering over the old city is Barcelona's cathedral, an imposing example of a medieval European church. The exterior features spires, gargoyles and a grand entranceway of concentric arches. Inside it's large, yet peaceful. The vaulted ceilings, delicately detailed stained glass, and elaborate woodcarvings inspire quiet contemplation. About two-dozen gilded side chapels tell stories of martyrs and saints. The adjacent cloister is a peaceful oasis, featuring palm trees, a mossy pond and a flock of geese. While the cathedral is ornate and overwhelming, the nearby basilica, Santa Maria del Mar, is simpler. Built in just over 50 years in the 14th century, the church is considered the finest surviving example of the pure Catalan Gothic style. Inside, the soaring columns and window after window of stained glass, even the rose window, somehow seem elegantly understated. My favorite features were the ominous skulls and crossbones on the floor, marking burial sites. The gothic interior of the Santa Maria del Mar is said to have inspired the design of another church that's a short subway trip away, though worlds distant -- Gaudi's masterpiece, the Sagrada Familia. I have to admit that, viewing it from a distance, I could see why some consider it an eyesore. But up close, and with the help of the provided audio guide, I learned to appreciate the religious symbolism that completely coats its outdoor facades. All skepticism slipped away once I stepped inside. Sunlight casts a rainbow through the multi-colored stained glass windows, and gothic columns seem to grow up and up to the towering ceiling, where they branch out like trees. Nearly 130 years after the project broke ground, construction cranes still loom over its towers. It's hoped the church will be complete by the 100th anniversary of Gaudi's death, in 2026. Meanwhile, Pope Benedict XVI consecrated it as a basilica last November. It's a spiritual place, but in a way that's completely different from Barcelona's medieval churches. Instead of dark and solemn, the Sagrada Familia is bright and even cheerful, a celebration of nature and devotion. For fans of Catalan modernism there is much more to see. Barcelona's Centre de Modernisme offers a guidebook featuring 115 buildings on a ""modernisme route."" If you can't get enough of the medieval, visit Barcelona's Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya. It's most famous for its one-of-a-kind collection of Romanesque art, dating back to the 11th century. The works were mostly salvaged from churches in the Pyrenees. Barcelona's rich history can't be fully appreciated by just visiting moderniste and medieval sites, but in a city with so much to experience, it's a great place to start.","Modernisme, or Catalan modernism, emerged in the late 1800s in Barcelona .

"(CNN) -- Complete shock, surprise and disappointment -- that was my reaction to revelations from documents released by Edward Snowden that the National Security Agency monitored my e-mails from 2006 to 2008 after I left the Bush White House. I am one of five professionals featured in an article in The Intercept who found the government was monitoring us without our knowledge. The others are Asim Ghafoor, a well-known lawyer; Hooshang Amirahmadi, a professor at Rutgers University; Agha Saeed, a political science professor at California State University, and Nihad Awad, the executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. What we share in common is that we are all Muslim. And none of us can believe there is any reason we should fall under suspicion. The technology the government uses to surreptitiously monitor domestic and international communications didn't surprise me. What was shocking to me was that nothing in my background would lead anyone to believe that I have any terrorist leanings or want to cause harm to the United States. I served my country in the U.S. Navy, worked as senior policy adviser in the Department of Homeland Security under President George W. Bush, was involved in my community and even ran for public office. There is not much more anyone can do to prove his or her complete loyalty to the United States. What's clear now is that the reason for spying on me is my religion. Some people may argue that my ties to the American Muslim Council gave the government probable cause to monitor me. But I had received my Top Secret/SCI (Sensitive Compartmented Information) clearance to work in the Department of Homeland Security after working with the American Muslim Council, not before. Needless to say, all aspects of your life are examined to obtain this level. When I was working with the council, my goal was to get Muslims involved in domestic politics, never foreign politics. Working in Homeland Security, I know more than others that sometimes people need to be monitored for security purposes, and there are times when such monitoring does not lead to anything. In those cases, however, at least something in those people's background or actions would cause suspicion. For example, they met secretly with terrorist groups or made some statements inciting violence. None of those factors exist in my case. Congress needs to exercise its oversight authority and look at the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act process and practice. On paper, the FISA procedure looks fair: An agent prepares an affidavit setting forth facts that establish probable cause that the subject is an agent of a foreign government. Then an independent judge examines the application and approves it. That is a good process -- but in practice, 99% of the applications are approved. Clearly something is wrong that nearly all applications are approved. Probable cause is clearly interpreted broadly in a FISA court. Congress needs to fix the practice. The issue for me is: What's next? I have no desire to file any sort of a lawsuit against the government. The United States is my home and like any American, I want to protect my home. I demonstrated that by proudly wearing my country's uniform. I am raising my kids here. I am clearly invested in my country. I think more Muslim Americans should be involved in government and in their communities. But I am concerned that many Muslims, hearing the news of government monitoring, will say ""What's the point?"" They will believe that no matter what they do, they will always be viewed with suspicion. This to me is the saddest possible result. I would hope the intelligence community, law enforcement, Congress and the Obama administration are also concerned. I hope my kids will not have to worry about their e-mails being monitored for exercising their religious freedom to be involved with organizations that support their faith, like millions of other Americans.","Faisal Gill: Documents released by Snowden show he was under surveillance .

"(CNN) -- This week's lesson from ""Dancing with the Stars"": Maybe it's not the best idea to be on a book tour while dancing in the competition. That became the downfall of contestant Tavis Smiley, who was sent home Tuesday night after performing a disco-inspired cha-cha earlier in the week. Although the routine earned the talk show host a 28, when viewer votes were counted it was Smiley and NASCAR driver Michael Waltrip who were in danger of going home. Smiley thinks the underwhelming response to his routine had something to do with his lack of practice time. He has just released a book on the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., and that work got in the way of his rehearsals for ""Dancing with the Stars."" ""This is hard, (this show is) so much harder than it looks,"" Smiley told ABC's ""Good Morning America,"" ""Our competitors on the show had 35 to 40 hours a week to rehearse. In the midst of a book tour, the most we could do were eight or 10 hours a week. You cannot perfect the cha-cha in eight or 10 hours; I don't care who you are."" Now we're down to 11 dancers still sweating it out for the Mirrorball Trophy. ""Fresh Prince"" star Alfonso Ribeiro was in the lead at the start of the season, but in the second week ""Back to the Future's"" Lea Thompson took the top of the scoreboard with her jive. She earned 35 points, and was trailed closely by ""Pretty Little Liars"" actress Janel Parrish, whose foxtrot to ""Call Me Maybe"" earned 34 points. Although he's now done with the show, Smiley said he has no regrets. ""(I) wanted to do something for himself,"" he said.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- TED started as an experiment in convergence and somehow, miraculously, has morphed into a source of fascination, inspiration and learning for millions of curious souls all over the world. I showed up at TED for the first time 11 years ago and was exhilarated to find myself among people turned on by cool ideas. Geeks, designers, entrepreneurs, scientists, global activists -- viewed one way, they couldn't have been more different. But everyone was curious; everyone wanted to dig below the surface and have a real conversation about stuff that mattered. I fell in love with the event so badly that within a year, I'd set my heart on acquiring it. It was the kind of thing you could devote a life to. Through a complicated series of events, I was able to do this in 2001 and transfer it into a not-for-profit foundation with the mission ""ideas worth spreading."" That's made it natural for TED to gradually transition from being an exclusive club to a global community that anyone can participate in. The key step was our decision three years ago to start posting the conference talks online for anyone to see for free. Far from robbing the conference of its crown jewels, the move has been transformative, both for TED and for some of the speakers who have achieved an unexpected new form of celebrity. With audiences in the millions, they are helping redefine what it is to be a great teacher. It is thrilling to imagine them delivering insight and inspiration to knowledge-seekers old and young, rich and poor, in every corner of the planet. TED was founded in 1984 by information architect Richard Saul Wurman and his partners. They saw that the industries of Technology, Entertainment and Design -- the T, E and D of TED -- were converging and that an event covering all three could be uniquely interesting. So it turned out. The first TED showcased the brand-new Apple Macintosh and strange round silver shiny discs, the first CDs. The program generated huge excitement, but it was a commercial failure, Five years later, Wurman tried again, and since then it's been held annually in California, with a growing number of spin-off events in other locations. But a strange thing happened over the years. The content of the conference became ever broader, incorporating scientists, business leaders, novelists, social entrepreneurs and movers and shakers of all stripes. We now seek out literally anyone who is remarkable from any discipline, provided they can find a way of powerfully sharing their passion with a general audience. Here's why this works. Our world has gotten more complicated than ever. And most issues simply cannot be understood by looking at them through a single lens. In the world's race to specialize, we forgot that actually all knowledge is connected. Take the current economic crisis. The bankers and economists and politicians are largely stumped. To fight our way through this may well require ideas from much wider sources -- perhaps from systems architects and evolutionary psychologists, or from researchers dreaming up new energy sources or philosophers or activists questioning our basic priorities. Policies and politicians come and go, but great ideas last forever. And we live in an age where they can spread faster than ever. But there's something else strange about TED. It turns out that if you spend a few days opening yourself to brilliance from multiple sources, not just intellectual but also aesthetic, something remarkable happens. You end up getting seized by a sense of possibility, excitement -- inspiration, even. Since taking over at TED, I've been trying to figure out what that means and what can be done with it. One of our attempted answers is the TED Prize. Each year, we grant this award to three individuals with world-changing potential. They get $100,000 ... but more important, they are granted a wish under the following terms: ""No restrictions. Think big. Be creative."" At TED, they reveal their wishes to an audience ready to be inspired. This has led to a series of thrilling collaborative projects (they're documented at tedprize.org). This year has seen another surprising development in which tens of thousands of people around the world have gathered in more than 300 self-organized TED-like events. We call this program TEDx (see ted.com/tedx) . TEDx events have been held in 50 countries, in schools, companies, campuses and theaters. They range in scale from 1,200 college kids in Los Angeles, California, to a tiny battered church in the middle of Africa's largest slum. The passion being put into these events is astonishing and proves a global interest in this new way of sharing knowledge and reawakening wonder. How big could this get? Well, it depends on how many people are out there with a passion to learn and a willingness to help shape a better future. Certainly, CNN's partnership is a big step forward for us, giving TED exposure to a vast global audience hungry for knowledge that matters. TEDTalks aren't usually about the story of the day. But the ideas they communicate will help shape the stories of tomorrow. Welcome to TED. Watch with an open mind ... and let your curiosity take you on a thrilling journey of discovery!

"(CNN) -- He calls it ""my spaceship."" From the soundproofed walls and floor to the large sofas and keyboard racks, there's only one prevailing color inside Akon's state-of-the-art personal studio. ""It is all white,"" says the multi-platinum selling artist, of the studio where he has recorded and produced several of his R&B and hip hop hits. ""It helps me think a lot easier,"" he adds. ""This is my place of creation -- I am self-engineered, I pretty much work everything in here myself."" Read this: Roaring success of 'Lion King' musician . It's also here where the Senegalese-American singer is putting the final touches to his fourth studio album, expected to be released in June, nearly 10 years after he first rose to fame with his 2004 debut offering ""Trouble."" Since then, Akon has sold millions of albums around the world and collaborated with countless pop and hip-hop icons such as Michael Jackson, Lady Gaga, Snoop Dog and Eminem. Along the way, he's also stirred up controversy on several occasions, catching criticism for exploiting his criminal past, as well as for his sexually explicit lyrics and concert shenanigans. Born in the United States to Senegalese parents, Akon, or Aliaune Damala Badara Thiam, spent his early years in the West African country. ""What I remember the most really was just running wild there,"" he says. ""Barefooted, swimming in dirty lakes, selling fruit, picking mango trees, hoping not to get caught because they don't take kindly to thieves in Africa,"" he adds, laughing. Read this: Healing a wounded nation through music . At around the age of 8, Akon left the ""jungle"" of Senegal for the ""concrete jungle"" of New Jersey. Yet, the transition into his new environment wasn't easy. ""Making friends was the hardest part,"" says Akon of his school years in the United States. ""I didn't speak any English; it was a different culture, dressing different. I would get teased a lot -- not playing the bully card -- but I found myself always trying to find ways to fitting in. I was always fighting."" Akon says that it was this reality, coupled with a desire ""to be cool,"" that sent him off the rails during his teenage years. Aged as young as 14, he was running with a bad crowd, involved in illegal activities including stealing cars -- which led to a six-month jail stint. Today, Akon says he feels ""lucky"" to have left that lifestyle behind him. ""The guys I came up with, none of them are here right now,"" he says. ""Four of them are dead, three are doing double life,"" he adds. ""It's more of a bitter-sweet success story for me because I was the one that actually slipped away and its only because I made the decision to change my life over after that one experience."" Read this: Afrobeats going global . But it was this background that shaped Akon's first steps in music. In 2004, he released his first single, ""Locked Up,"" to great success. Two years later, his second album, ""Konvicted,"" reached triple platinum with three million copies sold in the United States and more than five million worldwide by the end of 2007. But despite ""Konvicted's"" mega success, Akon says that period was a ""confusing"" time for him. ""All these records being broken and all the money made, you almost want to make yourself believe that you are invincible,"" he says. ""I wasn't sure what I was becoming."" During a notorious Akon concert in 2007, the singer threw a 15-year-old boy off the stage and onto a teenage girl who suffered a concussion. ""I was charged for it -- to this day, if I could have changed that, I wouldn't have did it."" During those days, Akon says, he let down Africa. ""I was the first to break it internationally, on that level, from Africa,"" says the rapper. ""Africa was really expecting me to represent them well and at that time I don't think I was doing that."" But that year also marked one of his most high-profile collaborations, working in the studio with Michael Jackson on a duet called ""Hold My Hand."" Akon finished the vocals in 2009, after Jackson's death, and the song became the first single released on the King of Pop's posthumous album titled ""Michael."" ""We snuck off to go to the movies, he had a disguise on,"" says Akon, recalling his collaboration with Jackson. ""It was me and his three kids and we were on the escalator and the people were like 'Akon, oh my God, Akon,' and I am signing autographs and laughing, thinking 'you don't even know who is beside me' -- the whole time, he is standing there laughing."" Looking ahead, Akon says his goal is to give back to his continent. He's set up Konfidence, a Senegalese foundation that's working to build schools and hospitals in the country, he says. ""I have learned a lot along the way and I am glad that I never regretted enough because my past made who I am today,"" he says. ""Just do understand that the person you see today is not the one from yesterday. ""I am going to keep advancing, doing as much as I can, but I really want to make the biggest impact in Africa.""","Akon is Senegalese-American multi-platinum selling artist and producer .

"(CNN) -- NASA says its latest Mars-exploring spacecraft is on track to fire up its thrusters and enter orbit this Sunday night, completing a 10-month journey of 442 million miles. NASA's MAVEN craft will live up to its formal name -- the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution craft -- by helping scientists figure out how ancient Mars changed so dramatically into the planet we know today. It will be the first mission devoted to studying the upper Martian atmosphere as a key to understanding the history of Mars' climate, water and habitability. Mars rover reaches key destination; 'new science ahead!' ""The evidence shows that the Mars atmosphere today is a cold, dry environment, one where liquid water really can't exist in a stable state,"" said Bruce Jakosky, MAVEN principal investigator, during a mission preview briefing Wednesday at NASA headquarters in Washington. ""But it also tells us when we look at older surfaces, that the ancient surfaces had liquid water flowing over it."" So where did the planet's water and carbon dioxide go? Jakosky said MAVEN will help unravel that mystery by using its scientific instruments to measure the composition and escape of gases in the Martian atmosphere. MAVEN will study the top of the atmosphere to determine the extent to which losing gas to space might have been the driving mechanism behind climate change, Jakosky said. Before MAVEN can begin its year of exploration, it has to be inserted into orbit around Mars. That is set to happen at about 10 p.m. ET September 21. The craft's six thruster engines will fire and burn for 33 minutes to slow the spacecraft down so it can get pulled into orbit around Mars. MAVEN will have company out near Mars, manmade and otherwise. India's first mission to the Red Planet, the Mars Orbiter Mission, is set to arrive a few days after MAVEN does. The director of NASA's Planetary Science Division, Jim Green, says the United States and India are interested in cooperating as their crafts gather data about the planet. There's a visitor of the cosmic kind, too. Comet Sliding Spring, which was discovered last year, will be closest to Mars about four weeks after MAVEN arrives. The comet is going to miss Mars by about 81,000 miles, said Jakosky. ""I'm told that the odds of having an approach that close to Mars are about one-in-a-million years,"" he said, adding that dust from the comet carries only a ""relatively minimal"" risk to the spacecraft. MAVEN will take advantage of the rare flyby by observing the comet itself, as well as its effect on the Martian atmosphere.

"(CNN) -- Tens of thousands of people marched through Manhattan sounding an urgent call for action to reverse global climate change Sunday. One marcher's sign read ""cut your emissions or you'll sleep with the fishes."" The ""People's Climate March"" in New York was billed as the largest of several protests held around the world two days before the start of the United Nations' Climate Summit. U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon walked with former U.S. Vice President Al Gore along the 2Â½-mile route. Celebrity protesters included comedian Chris Rock and actors Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo, who said he was marching for his children's future. ""I see the world changing very quickly already, and I want to do my best to give them the best world that they deserve to have and that I was fortunate to come up into,"" Ruffalo told CNN. Opinion: Re: No one cares about climate change . Ricken Patel, the founding executive director of march organizer Avaaz, told CNN the ""solution is so clear. It's to get to a 100% clean energy power society and economy."" ""We're seeing massive droughts across the Midwest and California,"" Patel said. ""We're seeing storms that are devastating the East Coast and the Gulf Coast. We're seeing flooding that's threatened this city and many others. All of those impacts that are happening, but it is just a taste test of what's to come if we don't urgently reverse course."" The Environmental Defense Fund said it expected up to 100,000 people to walk, while the New York Police Department predicted about 30,000 would participate.

"(CNN) -- The three Afghan National Army officers who disappeared while guests of the U.S. military at a training exercise in Massachusetts spent the night before they went missing at a strip club, police said. The owner of Zachary's Pub, a strip club in Mashpee, Massachusetts, notified police that that they believed Maj. Jan Mohammad Arash, Capt. Mohammad Nasir Askarzada and Capt. Noorullah Aminyar were at the club Friday night, according to Lt. John Santangelo of the Mashpee Police Department. The men went missing Saturday and turned up Monday in the custody of Canadian border guards at the Rainbow Bridge, a checkpoint on the border at Niagara Falls. They are now being charged with immigration violations. The men were in civilian clothes and were part of a group of about eight people, said Richard Halpern, the club's owner. ""They were doing whatever a normal guy does when they go to a strip club,"" he said, adding that they ""stayed for a couple of hours and left at 1 a.m."" Halpern said he received a call from military officials shortly after midnight on Saturday describing the missing soldiers and asking if he had seen them. ""Some of the girls said they didn't seem to understand what they were doing,"" Halpern told CNN. ""It looked like it was their first time in a club."" U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials took custody of the three Tuesday morning, Massachusetts ICE spokesman Daniel Modricker told CNN. They are being charged with administrative immigration violations and have been placed into removal proceedings, the spokesman said. The men arrived in the United States on September 11 for the annual Exercise Regional Cooperation and were quartered at Joint Base Cape Cod, according to the Massachusetts National Guard. The training included troops from six nations.","The men were sighted at Zachary's Pub, a strip club in Mashpee, Massachusetts .

"(CNN) -- As we approach the referendum, what is being proven time and time again is that the people of Scotland are showing a political will that has been sadly lacking in these islands for the last generation or so. Whatever the vote and whatever the outcome on September 18, the victory will be the revival of social democracy. Hopefully -- from my point of view, and that of the Scottish people -- the vote will be a resounding ""Yes."" A ""Yes"" which reinforces the will of the Scottish people to supersede the political apathy of the last twenty years or so. In the debate between ""Yes"" and ""No,"" there clearly has arisen confusion between Nationalism and Independence. Nationalist sentiment can obfuscate the point of Independence. This vote is not about nationalism, it is about social democracy, and for myself and the people of Scotland, social democracy is at the root of our desire for Independence. An independent state of Scotland will reinforce its own laws, embrace new forms of political thinking, new creeds, new political parties, and new positions of argument. Independence will allow a new system to be put in place, and in Scotland's case, and for the people of Scotland, a system of social equality where the yoke of the old feudal ideologies are finally dismantled. The political systems of New Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrats have atrophied in the UK; atrophied to such an extent that the dividing line between these ideologies have become increasingly blurred by each party's pragmatic desire for political power. A power to be got seemingly at any cost. And particularly in the Labour Party's case, to be got at the expense of political ideology. Sadly -- and as a member of the Labour Party it pains me greatly to write this -- over the last fifteen years or so I have witnessed the Labour Party's fundamental socialist thought being consistently compromised on a needs must basis, an ""ends justifies the means"" ideology; floundering in a swamp of sound bite sentiment. Labour's failure to understand and anticipate Scotland's desire for a state of independence could at root lie in its reconstitution of the party as New Labour in the 1990s. The need for this reconstitution came about as a desire for the party to purge itself of its top heavy industrial union dependency and militant tendency. It tried to create itself anew as New Labour, but perhaps in the process threw the baby out with the bath water. And yet, it might have succeeded in this metamorphosis had it not been for the all-wheening hubris of its leader, Anthony Charles Lynton Blair, who insisted in involving these islands in an illegal war which created a painful fissure in the body politic of the party. That fissure has never been healed. Faith was lost and has yet to be restored. And at this vital time when the big battalions of political thinking of Westminster are mustering their final offensive against Scottish Independence, the very act of this coercion creates in the Scottish character a defiance and an understanding of their true spirit; a spirit which despite overbearing adversity remains fiercely independent in its constitution. The environmental campaigner George Monbiot has written that ""to vote 'No' in this referendum is to choose to live under a political system that sustains one of the rich world's highest levels of inequality and deprivation. A system that treats the natural world, civic life, equality, public health, and effective public services as dispensable luxuries, and the freedom of the rich to exploit the poor as non-negotiable."" Throughout the Independence campaign, I have been shocked and shaken by the disconnect of my colleagues and their failure to understand the state of play throughout the whole of this nation, exemplified by the needs of the Scottish people. I have been appalled at the condescension and patronizing attitudes of those who I would have thought would have known better, and who could have offered far deeper and more profound arguments against the idea of Independence. And not once during this entire campaign has there been a successful attempt by the naysayers to match and compete with the profound belief of those in the ""Yes"" camp: Their arguments have always deteriorated into tactics of fear, and the disparagement of faith. But you know, when you go into the polling booth and you place your mark on the ballot paper, that very act, in its purest form, is an act of faith, ""Yes"" or ""No."" The only guarantee you've got is the guarantee of your own spirit, for good or for bad. And on September 18, my hope and the hope for my people is to choose ""Yes,"" for good. WATCH: Brian Cox and Rory Stewart debate independence .

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Secret Service boosted its presence and its surveillance measures around the White House on Monday after an Iraq war veteran, who is apparently suffering from PTSD, jumped over a White House fence. Officers patrolling the area will be out in greater numbers and will be ""looking for individuals who don't look like tourists,"" a federal law enforcement officer told CNN. Two security incidents in two days have raised concerns about the safety at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. On Friday, Omar Gonzalez hopped the north fence and sprinted just past the north portico White House doors when he was stopped, Secret Service spokesman Brian Leary said. Gonzalez carried a Spyderco VG-10 folding knife with a 3Â½-inch serrated blade in his pants pocket, according to an affidavit. He allowed authorities to search his car, where police say they found more than 800 rounds of ammunition in boxes and magazines. They also found two hatchets and a machete in his car. A Secret Service officer said he yelled at the intruder to stop. Gonzalez told a Secret Service agent ""that he was concerned that the atmosphere was collapsing and needed to get the information to the President of the United States so that he could get the word out to the people,"" according to the affidavit. President Barack Obama and his family were not at home at the time. Friday was not Gonzalez's first run in with police. In July, he was arrested in Wythe County, Virginia, and charged with possession of a shotgun and a sniper rifle. He was also charged with eluding and evading arrest. In addition, police say they found a map with the White House circled. In late August, Gonzalez was stopped while walking along the White House fence. He carried a hatchet and allowed police to search his car, where they found camping gear and two dogs. He was not arrested then. How the Secret Service could beef up White House security . Deteriorating mental state . Gonzalez's former stepson told CNN's Mary Grace Lucas that Gonzalez is an Iraq war veteran who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. Gonzalez did three tours in Iraq and is a ""great, great guy,"" his ex-stepson, Jerry S. Murphy, said. He said the knife that was found in Gonzalez's pocket was a weapon the veteran routinely carried. Murphy said Gonzalez's eight-year marriage to Murphy's mother ended two years ago, confirmed by marriage records. He said he last spoke to Gonzalez around the time of the split but knows that Gonzalez was seeing a therapist on base at Fort Hood in Texas. Murphy said his former stepfather was diagnosed with PTSD and paranoia, and his base psychiatrist had prescribed medication for both conditions. Murphy views Gonzalez as a ""hero"" who took great pride in serving his country. But after each deployment, Gonzalez's mental state seemed to deteriorate, Murphy said. Gonzalez is accused of unlawfully entering a restricted building or grounds while carrying a deadly or dangerous weapon, officials said. He appeared Monday in court, where a judge decided Gonzalez was a flight risk and a potential danger to the President. He will be held in custody until his next hearing, scheduled for October 1. Minutes before Gonzalez jumped the fence, the President and his daughters left the South Lawn by helicopter. It is not clear where First Lady Michelle Obama was, but officials tell CNN that the family was staying at Camp David, Maryland, for the weekend. Another security incident . In the second security incident over the weekend, Kevin Carr is accused of driving up to a security barrier Saturday and trying to walk to and enter the White House. Carr, of Shamong, New Jersey, was arrested and charged with unlawful entry, Leary told CNN. Records show Carr was born in 1995, making him about 19 years old. According to Leary, the incident happened at the entrance at 15th and E streets, where the driver did not stop when the Secret Service ordered him to do so. The man's car did not hit the barriers at the entrance, and the driver got out of his vehicle. Carr was arrested after he refused to leave, Leary said. The Obamas were not at home at the time of the second incident either. Criticism of White House security . The Secret Service said Gonzalez should have been stopped faster and are investigating personnel and reviewing security policies and procedures. Rep. Peter King, R-New York, demanded a full investigation and called for a congressional hearing to ensure that changes are made. ""There can be a lot of conspiracies against a President. A lot of very complex assassination plots,"" King said on Fox News. ""This is the most basic, the most simple type of procedure and how anyone, especially in these days of ISIS, and we're concerned about terrorist attacks, someone could actually get into the White House without being stopped is inexcusable."" May: Lost driver ends up in White House motorcade . In a statement from White House on Saturday night, spokesman Frank Benenati said the President expressed his support for the Secret Service. ""The President has full confidence in the Secret Service and is grateful to the men and women who day in and day out protect himself, his family and the White House,"" the statement read. ""The Secret Service is in the process of conducting a thorough review of the event on Friday evening, and we are certain it will be done with the same professionalism and commitment to duty that we and the American people expect from the USSS."" CNN's Jim Acosta, Cassie Spodak, Erin McPike, Mary Kay Mallonee and Evan Perez reported from Washington.

"(CNN) -- This year's flu vaccine was less effective than officials previously thought, particularly for the elderly, said officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Officials have said the worst may be over and flu cases are declining. The 2012-13 flu season began in December, much earlier than usual, and was more severe than last year's. That particularly was true for those 65 or older, according to a CDC report Thursday. The vaccine was 9% effective in protecting people in that age group. ""One possible explanation for this is that some older people did not mount an effective immune response to the H3N2 component of this season's vaccine,"" the report said. ""However, it's not possible to say that for sure."" An H3N2 flu strain has been the most dominant and has been especially hard on the elderly. Among those over 65, 146 per 100,000 were hospitalized for the flu virus, compared with a rate of 30 per 100,000 last year, the CDC said. Dr. Thomas Frieden, the CDC's director, said this month in a congressional hearing that about twice as many elderly people have been hospitalized with flu symptoms than in recent years. That includes the 2007-08 and 2003-04 seasons, which also saw a predominant H3N2 strain. ""It seems that this year's flu vaccine is not nearly as effective as we would like among people over the age of 65 for one particular strain of flu,"" Frieden said Thursday. ""That's why early treatment is so important."" Officials maintained, however, that those 65 and older should be vaccinated yearly, for reasons including that this population is at high risk of serious illness, hospitalization and death from the flu. ""This flu season has been worse than average and particularly severe for the elderly,"" Frieden said. ""Although it's far from perfect, flu vaccination is by far the best tool we have to protect from the flu."" Authorities earlier had said the flu vaccine was 62% effective for adults and children. In the Thursday report, the CDC revised that to 56%. The new number, the agency said, is ""not significantly different"" and continues to fall within the confidence interval established earlier. But the lower number includes an additional three weeks of data and was adjusted for various factors, including age and race or ethnicity. ""Both estimates indicate moderate vaccine effectiveness in preventing outpatient medical visits due to circulating flu viruses in most of the population,"" the report said. In addition, while this year's vaccine was considered a good match for the most common circulating flu viruses, it only provided 47% protection against H3N2, the main virus. ""We simply need a better vaccine against influenza, one that works better and lasts longer,"" Frieden said. The Department of Health and Human Services as well as the private sector are working on such a project, he said. In addition, less than half of school-age children -- the population mainly responsible for spreading the flu virus -- got the flu shot, experts said. The CDC recommends the vaccine for those 6 months of age and older. According to the latest numbers released Friday by the CDC, ""influenza activity remained elevated in the United States, but decreased in most areas.""

"Cairo (CNN) -- Former President Anwar Sadat's ""infitah"" or open door policy was a megaproject touted as a fix-all to Egypt's ailing economy. The idea seemed logical on paper -- attracting foreign investment as a means of reaching economic prosperity. In reality, however, the open door policy widened social disparities, yielding a boom in construction, hotel, and tourism industries and concentrating wealth in the hands of a few. By 1977 -- nearly three years after the project had been in effect -- nine out of 10 Egyptians were living in poverty and half of the country's men didn't have regular jobs. Sadat's decision to address the situation with a World Bank loan was conditional upon cutting subsidies for basic foodstuffs. The result were the infamous ""bread riots"" of 1977. Nearly 40 years later, a new $8.4 billion dollar Suez Canal expansion project stands poised to -- as a World Bank official put it -- ""change the economic landscape of Egypt"" by engaging private business and creating at least one million new jobs. The project will likely create wealth -- but will it be shared by all? Egypt's recent history with such projects raises doubts. Former President Hosni Mubarak embarked upon several neoliberal projects which were also billed as economic fix-alls that ultimately only benefited a select few. Cairo 2050 in the late 2000s and Toshka in the late 1990s were two massive urban planning projects costing into the billions which did little to address Egypt's social disparities and eventually failed. Both of these projects hinged upon displacing something around 20% of the Egyptian population -- many of whom were living in informal urban areas in the Nile Valley -- to satellite towns in the desert. Toskha relied on private sector investments while Cairo 2050 sought to replace Nile valley residents with five star hotels, business parks, wide boulevards, and compounds. Before these two projects was the smaller-scaled Dreamland, a private residence complex 17 km west of Cairo designed for the upper classes seeking an escape from the din of the city. In his piece, Dreamland: The Neoliberalism of Your Desires, Timothy Mitchell uses the example of the project to show the lopsided economic benefits of Mubarak's projects. Mitchell describes Dreamland as a complex featuring ""luxury fiber-optic-wired villas, shopping malls, theme parks, golf courses, and polo grounds"" staffed by employees who didn't earn enough in a month to attend its amusement park. Mitchell also points to nationwide social disparities yielded by Mubarak's neoliberal project focus, explaining that from 1990 to 1995, public industrial sector wages dropped eight percent, and that by 1999 soup kitchens had reappeared and school teachers were making less than $2 a day. Today Egypt continues to suffer from a wide range of economic and social issues. Many of them, like unemployment, and problems with sewage and running water, are more or less as they were when Sadat came to office in 1970. Others, such as public education, insufficient electricity, cases of Hepatitis C and poor hospital care have only worsened. Recently, President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi stated that the world's poorest education system needed 30,000 new ""quality teachers"" -- but added that it wasn't possible now as it would cost LE 18 billion ($2.5 billion). But couldn't the government tone down its megaprojects and allocate some of its funds to social programs like this one? A smaller expansion of the Suez Canal and following up on Sisi's ""expensive"" suggestions to reform the education system would reduce illiteracy rates and improve performance in the labor market while also having a positive effect on the general health of the population. It would also strengthen the social contract by showing that the government is taking action that will directly affect the livelihood of more than just a few. If Egypt's current economic situation wasn't an aberration -- if this was the first time the government was faced with laundry list of economic problems -- then the focus on a project like the Suez expansion would be understandable. However, as the lights in Egypt continue to flicker, it seems like the country needs something more than another fix-all megaproject to heal its same economic ails.","Egypt continues to suffer from a wide range of economic and social issues, writes Amr Kotb .

"GRINNELL, Iowa (CNN) -- The college student who was told what question to ask at one of New York Sen. Hillary Clinton's campaign events said ""voters have the right to know what happened"" and she wasn't the only one who was planted. Student Muriel Gallo-Chasanoff said a staffer told her what to ask at a campaign event for Sen. Hillary Clinton. In an exclusive on-camera interview with CNN, Muriel Gallo-Chasanoff, a 19-year-old sophomore at Grinnell College in Grinnell, Iowa, said giving anyone specific questions to ask is ""dishonest,"" and the whole incident has given her a negative outlook on politics. Gallo-Chasanoff, whose story was first reported in the campus newspaper, said what happened was simple: She said a senior Clinton staffer asked if she'd like to ask the senator a question after an energy speech the Democratic presidential hopeful gave in Newton, Iowa, on November 6. ""I sort of thought about it, and I said 'Yeah, can I ask how her energy plan compares to the other candidates' energy plans?'"" Gallo-Chasanoff said Monday night. According to Gallo-Chasanoff, the staffer said, "" 'I don't think that's a good idea, because I don't know how familiar she is with their plans.' ""  Watch the student speak out about question » . He then opened a binder to a page that, according to Gallo-Chasanoff, had about eight questions on it. ""The top one was planned specifically for a college student,"" she added. ""It said 'college student' in brackets and then the question."" Topping that sheet of paper was the following: ""As a young person, I'm worried about the long-term effects of global warming. How does your plan combat climate change?""  Watch the student ask the planted question » . And while she said she would have rather used her own question, Gallo-Chasanoff said she didn't have a problem asking the campaign's because she ""likes to be agreeable,"" adding that since she told the staffer she'd ask their pre-typed question she ""didn't want to go back on my word."" Clinton campaign spokesman Mo Elleithee said, ""This is not acceptable campaign process moving forward. We've taken steps to ensure that it never happens again."" Elleithee said Clinton had ""no idea who she was calling on."" Gallo-Chasanoff wasn't so sure. ""I don't know whether Hillary knew what my question was going to be, but it seemed like she knew to call on me because there were so many people, and ... I was the only college student in that area,"" she said.  Watch the full interview » . In a separate statement in response to the campus article, the campaign said, ""On this occasion a member of our staff did discuss a possible question about Sen. Clinton's energy plan at a forum. ... This is not standard policy and will not be repeated again."" Gallo-Chasanoff said she wasn't the only person given a question. ""After the event,"" she said, ""I heard another man ... talking about the question he asked, and he said that the campaign had asked him to ask that question."" The man she referenced prefaced his question by saying that it probably didn't have anything to do with energy, and then posed the following: ""I wonder what you propose to do to create jobs for the middle-class person, such as here in Newton where we lost Maytag."" A Maytag factory in Newton recently closed, forcing hundreds of people out of their jobs. During the course of the late-night interview on Grinnell's campus, Gallo-Chasanoff also said that the day before the school's newspaper, Scarlet and Black, printed the story, she wanted the reporter to inform the campaign out of courtesy to let them know it would be published. She said the ""head of publicity for the campaign,"" a man whose name she could not recall, had no factual disputes with the story. But, she added, a Clinton intern spoke to her to say the campaign requested she not talk about the story to any more media outlets and that if she did she should inform a staffer. ""I'm not under any real obligation to do that, and I haven't talked to [the campaign] anymore,"" Gallo-Chasanoff said, adding that she doesn't plan to. ""If what I do is come and just be totally truthful, then that's all anyone can ask of me, and that's all I can ask of myself. So I'll feel good with what I've done. I'll feel like I've done the right thing."" The Clinton campaign's acknowledgment that it planted a question reinforces a widely held criticism of the senator -- that she is not entirely honest, said Bill Schneider, CNN's senior political analyst. ""It's the same criticism often made of her husband,"" Schneider said. ""Most Americans never felt Bill Clinton was honest and trustworthy, even when he got elected in 1992 -- with only 43 percent of the vote. His critics called him 'Slick Willy.' ... Will her critics start referring to the New York senator as 'Slick Hillary?' "" Asked if this experience makes her less likely to support Clinton's presidential bid, Gallo-Chasanoff, an undecided voter, said, ""I think she has a lot to offer, but I -- this experience makes me look at her campaign a little bit differently."" ""The question and answer sessions -- especially in Iowa -- are really important. That's where the voters get to ... have like a real genuine conversation with this politician who could be representing them."" While she acknowledged ""it's possible that all campaigns do these kind of tactics,"" she said that doesn't make it right. ""Personally I want to know that I have someone who's honest representing me."" A second person has a story similar to Gallo-Chasanoff's. Geoffrey Mitchell of Hamilton, Illinois, on the Iowa border, said the Clinton campaign wanted him to ask a certain question at an Iowa event in April. ""He asked me if I would ask Sen. Clinton about ways she was going to confront the president on the war in Iraq, specifically war funding,"" said Geoffrey Mitchell, a supporter of Sen. Barack Obama, D-Illinois. ""I told him it was not a question I felt comfortable with."" No questions were taken at the event. Elleithee said this incident was different from what happened with Gallo-Chasanoff in Newton. Elleithee said the staffer ""bumped into someone he marginally knew"" and during a conversation with Mitchell, ""Iraq came up."" Elleithee denied the campaign tried to plant him as a friendly questioner in the audience. Mitchell said he had never met the staffer before the event. Former presidential adviser David Gergen said the front-runner's campaign could take a hit from the incident. ""When a campaign plants a question, it's a pretty minor infraction of the rules -- like a parking ticket,"" Gergen said. ""The problem here is it feeds a damaging perception of Hillary Clinton that she can't quite be trusted.""

"(CNN) -- If the word ""secretary"" doesn't conjure up an image for you, just run a quick Google Image search. The pencil in the mouth is a recurring motif, as are beaming women in headsets seated in front of computers. Images abound of women in low-cut blouses, legs crossed under tiny skirts, alongside head shots of Secretaries of State Madeleine Albright and Hillary Clinton. The women of ""Mad Men"" hold their ground next to bondage shots of Maggie Gyllenhaal from the movie ""Secretary."" Given its cultural baggage, the term ""secretary"" has been jettisoned over the past three decades. It's why we won't be celebrating Professional Secretaries Day on April 25, but rather, Administrative Professionals Day. Retiring the term made way for the ""administrator,"" ""assistant"" and ""support staff"" of today. (It's tucked away with the word ""stewardess."") Then why is it that billionaire Warren Buffett still has a secretary -- with a higher tax rate, as we heard over and over again this week -- and not an executive assistant? Also on CNN: 'Secretary' title is a blast from the past . ""It's a generational difference. Older people are used to the word secretary because that's what everyone used to be,"" said Deborah Tannen, professor of linguistics at Georgetown University. ""You can chalk it up to changing conventions and how words over time become associated with practices or habits that become out of date."" Buffett is 81, and became chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway in 1970, just as the term was starting to fade. Tannen has an assistant, but if she'd had a helper 30 years ago, she probably would have called her a secretary, she said. Debbie Bosanek, Buffett's longtime secretary, has never publicly questioned the title, and has garnered a bit of fame from her workplace in Omaha, Nebraska. She even attended the State of the Union as a guest of the White House this year. ""The word secretary, for many people, is associated with an earlier time when those jobs were held exclusively by women and women were limited to jobs like that,"" Tannen said. The National Secretaries' Association was founded in 1942 as a professional network for the growing number of women entering secretarial ranks during World War II. There were limited job opportunities for women, and the title of secretary could have some cachet. But to be a secretary was still seen as women's work over which the glass ceiling loomed large, spokesman Ray Weikal said. By 1998, the organization had evolved into the International Association of Administrative Professionals to encompass the growing variety of job titles and to recognize the advancing role of administrative support staff, said Weikal, who, by the way, goes by the title communications specialist. ""Over time, being a secretary became increasingly more complex and secretaries were expected to master a range of very technical jobs. In many cases, they were the ones pushing for the adoption of electric typewriters and fax machines, and they were very often the ones integrating those kinds of technology into the office,"" he said. ""People who had those jobs increasingly felt the title frankly did not represent who they were as professionals, so you started to see the development of other job titles."" The shift was also about overcoming stigma, said Lynn Peril, author of ""Swimming in the Steno Pool: A Retro Guide to Making it in the Office."" ""The term secretary really did not have much positive connotation by the mid-1970s because so much cultural baggage had been attached to it by that time,"" she said. What kind of baggage, exactly? Peril has a Pinterest board dedicated to the topic, and anyone who has seen an episode of ""Mad Men"" knows the markers: typists who take dictations and write memos but also serve as buxom eye candy and objects for an extramarital fling. It's the kind of baggage that made secretaries the subjects of pulp novels with titles like ""Office Affair"" and ""The Schemers"" and the purported case study, ""Sex and the Secretary."" A more Nancy Drew-ish book series ""Private Secretary"" drew upon themes of small town girls looking for love in the big city. ""Not every secretary was a feminist,"" Peril said, ""but one of the things they realized from the feminist movement was they wanted to be treated with respect and one way to achieve that was to jettison the title 'secretary.'"" That's not to say the title is gone. By day, Peril is a legal secretary, and says she doesn't mind the title. Of the 22,000 members in the administrative professionals' association, 15% identified as secretaries in 2010, up from 7% in 2009, Weikal said. He has no real explanation for it, but speculates it might be driven by nostalgia. ""I call it the 'Mad Men' effect. I don't have concrete evidence for that, but anecdotally, there's evidence to suggest there may be a culture shift to use the title secretary."" Perhaps a better question: Does it matter? Not according to several secretaries we talked to. ""I think everyone is on their toes about being politically correct. But I don't think it matters,"" said Jasmine Garnes, a 30-year-old executive assistant at a commercial real estate company in Atlanta. Her responsibilities run the gamut from scheduling meetings to organizing conferences. As long as the paycheck clears, ""It's basically the same job with a different title. It means you have a job.""","Term ""secretary"" faded in an effort to distance profession from smutty stigma .
As secretaries' duties expanded, many felt the title no longer fit the role .
Debbie Bosanek, Buffett's longtime secretary, has never publicly questioned the title .
Many executive assistants and administrative support staff say the title is meaningless ."
"(CNN) -- A bus carrying Togo's national soccer team to a tournament in Angola came under fire Friday, and Togolese officials said they were weighing whether to pull out of the prestigious Africa Cup of Nations, which starts Sunday. There were conflicting reports on the casualties. Angola's official press agency, ANGOP, reported nine people were wounded -- eight Togolese and one Angolan. Earlier, Togo striker Thomas Dossevi, who was on the bus, said the bus driver was killed in the attack and three others were injured. An armed wing of a separatist group -- the Forces for Liberation of the State of Cabinda -- claimed responsibility for the attack. CNN cannot independently verify the claim. Dossevi, 30, who plays for French league side Nantes, told CNN ""armed rebels"" with AK-47s had opened fire. ""We were attacked by armed rebels who used Kalashnikovs. We had just passed the border and a couple of minutes later we were attacked from both sides. ""We hid below the seats -- we had police protection in front and behind but we were attacked from both sides. As soon as I heard the bullets I went to the floor ... the attack lasted for 10 to 15 minutes. ""Everyone is at the hospital, the whole team, as everybody wants to be with the injured players. We're waiting to get police protection so we can go to the hotel and sleep,"" Dossevi said. The team was headed to Angola for the competition when it was attacked near the border between Angola and the Republic of Congo, according to the Manchester City Football Club in Britain, who had one of its star players on the bus. ""Manchester City can confirm that striker Emmanuel Adebayor is uninjured after this afternoon's attack on the Togo team bus in Angola,"" a statement on the club's Web site said. ""Club officials have spoken with Adebayor and though shaken by the terrible events, he is unharmed."" ""We are currently in talks with the Football Association over what may happen next,"" the club said. Togo is scheduled to play Ghana on Monday in Cabinda, which is one of the tournament venues. Cabinda is a disputed, oil-rich enclave located within the Democratic Republic of Congo. A strip of that nation separates it from Angola, one of the world's largest energy producers and a major supplier of petroleum and liquefied natural gas to the U.S. market. Angola, which was wracked by civil war for nearly three decades, brokered a peace deal in 2006 with separatists seeking an independent republic of Cabinda. Manchester City Manager Roberto Mancini expressed condolences for the injured players and their families. ""Our thoughts are with the Togo team, their Football Association and the people. We send them our best wishes at this traumatic time,"" he said. Togo is a strip of a nation that averages about 60 miles wide, nestled between Benin and Ghana in West Africa. It is smaller than the U.S. state of West Virginia.","Bus carrying Togo national soccer team fired on with machine guns .

"(CNN) -- Change is never pretty. And the change that results when 50 states step in to take on a job Washington has tried and failed to do can be especially messy. This is what's happening -- with a vengeance -- on immigration. In the past five years, there has been a virtual revolution in immigration lawmaking. And the result is not just chaos -- it's a lot of bad policy. States from Arizona to Virginia have enacted laws cracking down on illegal immigration. Some go after the immigrants; some target the businesses that hire them. Some rely on local police to do the job; others require that employers use the federal E-Verify system to check the immigration status of employees. Many of these statutes have been challenged in court, and the decisions that have been handed down are all over the map. The most controversial provisions of Arizona's 2010 immigration law, Senate Bill 1070, were put on hold by a federal judge before they could go into effect, and in April the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that ruling. But when Alabama's similar law, passed in June, came before a federal judge, she came to exactly the opposite conclusion, upholding sections almost identical to those blocked by the 9th Circuit. And on Friday, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals took yet a third view, blocking some provisions of the Alabama law but upholding others -- including the section that permits local police to ask about the immigration status of people they stop for other reasons. An immigration reform advocate who went to sleep five years ago when Congress last tried and failed to pass immigration reform wouldn't recognize the landscape today. The notion that immigration policy is a federal responsibility -- once widely accepted by both parties -- has been shattered, probably forever. Far from finding state immigration laws unconstitutional -- as many legal experts once insisted -- the Supreme Court's May ruling in the Whiting v. U.S. Chamber of Commerce case endorsed the principle that states can and should play a significant role in controlling illegal immigration. And policies once unthinkable to many are now commonplace. A full one-third of the states now require some or all employers to use the federal E-Verify system to check the immigration status of new hires. Four states have enacted measures modeled on Arizona's controversial policing law. Of course, it's understandable that states are stepping in to grapple with immigration: The system is dysfunctional, and voters want something done. The problem is that most state lawmakers respond to this clamor by intensifying state enforcement. But critical as enforcement is, enforcement alone won't solve the problem. To do that, lawmakers need to combine enforcement with fixes to the legal immigration system -- providing enough visas for immigrants who contribute to the economy, create jobs and keep our cities vital while also protecting U.S. workers. And these kinds of fixes are much harder for states to make. So instead, most simply crack down harder on the broken system. Consider what happened this year in Alabama, the state with the nation's toughest immigration law. The new measure touches nearly every aspect of life in Alabama: hiring, firing, policing, the criminal justice system, state contracts, schools and religion -- the aim being to make every aspect of life harsher and less hospitable for illegal immigrants.The two recent court decisions on the law are not the last word -- there will be many appeals. And in the meantime, chaos reigns across Alabama. Local law enforcement officials are at a loss, unsure who they should asking for immigration papers or where to house those they arrest -- most jails in Alabama are already full. Immigrants are fleeing the state in droves -- illegal immigrants but also legal residents who have unauthorized relatives and are afraid to lead police to their doors. Five percent of Hispanic children have stopped attending school. Employers -- particularly farmers -- are complaining desperately about labor shortages. And fruit and vegetables are rotting in fields across the state. Is there a silver lining? At first blush, it's hard to see one. But sometimes things have to get worse before they get better. Voters aren't blind. Most support tough immigration enforcement, but they can also see the crops rotting not just in Alabama but also in Georgia, Arizona and other states. Employers and business groups once hesitant to get involved in the debate are coming out of the woodwork to complain about worker shortages. And in a few states, this has led to productive dialogue, even, occasionally, a breakthrough. In a handful of states, the two parties have put their heads together and considered options for solving the problem. In other places, lawmakers have listened to employers when they explained the damage harsh enforcement would do to the economy. This ferment bore fruit in several states this year. In Arizona, Indiana, Kansas, Tennessee and Texas, legislators stopped short of passing the most draconian measures on the table. And in Utah, politicians, business leaders, law enforcement and faith groups came together to enact legislation that went beyond enforcement only -- trying to create a system that works, at least in Utah. The most important part of the Utah solution is a state guest-worker program. Exactly how it will function is controversial -- Utah's answer involves unauthorized workers already in the state and others waiting in Mexico for legal visas. But the underlying principle is only common sense: replacing illegal immigrants with a legal foreign work force that employers can turn to when they can't find enough willing and able American workers. Justice Louis Brandeis called the states the ""laboratories"" of democracy. A lot of what's going on in those laboratories today is disastrous. Certainly, in Alabama, the results look more like a train wreck than science. But maybe even that offers some reason for hope. After all, even Congress can stand by only so long. At some point, surely, Washington will have to impose order on the chaos spreading in the states. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tamar Jacoby.","Tamar Jacoby: States grappling with immigration by making own laws have made bad policy .

"(CNN) -- In November 2009, Norwegian freelance journalist Paul Refsdal is riding in a pick-up truck on a dusty track of Afghan road. The Taliban have kidnapped him. If the truck turns right, he knows he's being sold to another militant group. A left turn means his kidnappers have decided to let him go. His journey started when Refsdal, who wanted to document the daily lives of the Taliban, accepted the invitation of a Taliban commander to film him and his fighters. Refsdal later accompanied another Taliban commander, Omar, to his hideout on a second embed. As part of CNN's ""Taliban"" documentary, Refsdal talked with CNN's Anderson Cooper about going from invited guest to kidnap victim -- a harrowing experience that began the way it later ended, with Refsdal in a truck. Here is an edited excerpt: . REFSDAL: We rent a pickup truck and we drive into this valley that doesn't really have a road. I'm told it is not possible to drive anymore. We will have to walk for several hours up the hillside to one village, and we have to sneak a little bit. Omar is very particular about I should cover my face. I assume this is because they don't want informers to see that there's a foreigner coming. And we sleep in a house, and everything seems OK. Then, the next day we are asked to go to another house, just 100 meters down the hillside. We have to wait there, because they're going to have a meeting. After a couple hours, one of the fighters comes and says he's from al Qaeda. And he says that he has information that I was spying for the coalition, so both my translator and I will be executed tonight. And he goes on, saying that we're going to be killed with a knife. ... He explains how much he hates foreigners and he wants to eat the flesh of foreigners. In the first moment, you are shocked. But then, I kind of go on autopilot. I know what to say. I have some pre-prepared arguments. You know, describing why I cannot be a spy. Why I'm not responsible for what my government does. And then he starts talking about money. And I am so happy. I mean, I don't smile, but I am so relieved. COOPER: Once he starts talking about money, you're happy? REFSDAL: Yes. Because then I know this is just business; that all of the talk about eating flesh and beheading is just nonsense. ... He says he wants $500,000. And I say that's not possible. I want to bring the sum down. To make them understand there's not going to be a lot of dollars. So, I talk with my translator and we come up with a counteroffer of $20,000. COOPER: Why $20,000? REFSDAL: Because that's possible. I mean, $20,000 I could get quite easily. ANDERSON: You're negotiating? REFSDAL: Yes. ANDERSON: For your life? REFSDAL: Yeah. But, you know, that's Afghanistan. You never pay the asking price, so to say. So, we're making a counteroffer of $20,000. And they come back with other options, other alternatives for granting my freedom: a prisoner exchange, or ransom, or I convert to Islam. But, if none of these three, then it's beheading. So, I send the kidnappers the message that yes, in that situation, I could convert to Islam. I convert to Islam on the second day of the kidnapping. I keep my word. But Omar, he doesn't keep his. I am not released. And the day after, we are back to the $20,000 and how can we get the money here. Because the kidnappers are amateurs, they give me the phone to call around to get the money. I mean, this is Afghanistan and things there are quite absurd sometimes. I'm negotiating with the kidnappers, and I'm making my own ransom phone calls. I call al Jazeera, and I call the Norwegian embassy. With Al Jazeera, I speak in English, a language the kidnappers do not understand. Talking with my embassy, I speak in Norwegian, and you know, I can start giving information, where I'm kept, how many people are in the house, et cetera, et cetera, under the pretext of arranging for the money. So, we're waiting. And then, suddenly, there's a new development. The man from al Qaeda speaks with my translator. And my translator explains that Omar has an offer from another group. The other group wants to buy me for $50,000, and that's bad news. COOPER: That's really bad news, because groups do trade hostages. ... Do you start to get really scared? REFSDAL: Yes. I understand things are starting to get out of control. If this other group pays Omar $50,000 for me, what ransom do you think they will demand? I mean, it will be at least $250,000, probably half a million or even more. This is not a good position. Between the fifth and the sixth day-- Omar is receiving phone calls, as far as I know, from his spiritual leader in Pakistan, from the Taliban spokesman, and also apparently from the commander of the Pakistani Taliban. And all of them are saying that he should release his hostage. So, Omar is under pressure from the Taliban to release me. COOPER: Why? REFSDAL: For the main leadership, let's say, of the Taliban, it is embarrassing for them that a hostage converting to Islam is still being held. On the sixth day, the fighter from Al-Qaeda comes and he says, ""Today, you're gonna be released."" Of course, we don't believe him, because he's been lying all during the whole situation. Later, two other fighters arrive. And one of them is carrying my video camera. They want to make an interview. They ask me, ""Have you been beaten by the Taliban, by the fighters?"" And I say no. ""Are you gonna inform the Americans about our positions?"" And I say, ""Of course not."" And that's it. Then we are told we are leaving. So we walk south out of the valley for five hours. The night comes and we reach a dirt road. There is a pick up truck there with three men I'd never seen before. And we are just left with these three men. So we don't really know, are we sold or are we free? We get in the pickup truck and we start going down a dirt track. When we get down to a paved road, if we turn to the right, we will be heading to the Korengal Valley, which means Omar has sold us to another group. But, if we turn left, we will be heading for the town, and we are free. So, that's kind of nerve-wracking going down there. And then, we take the left. COOPER: And so, you knew you were going to be free? REFSDAL: Yeah. ANDERSON: That must have been the greatest left turn of your life. REFSDAL: Yeah. Yeah.","Freelance journalist Paul Refsdal embedded with the Taliban last year .

"(CNN) -- Hawaii state lawmaker Tom Brower was fed up with the state's homeless problem. His solution, however, left him branded a vigilante. Brower took a sledgehammer to abandoned shopping carts. ""I get a lot of complaints about stolen and abandoned shopping carts in Waikiki, and I was thinking as a public servant, 'What can I do that would be practical and I can literally do overnight,'"" Brower told CNN affiliate KITV. ""I'm not doing anything different than doing a community cleanup, or what the city's administration has tried to do with the issue of people illegally camping on the streets,"" he insisted. ""I'm just doing it quicker."" He began in late October and estimated that he destroyed about 30 of the carts, which are often used by homeless people.

""I guess I shouldn't use the sledgehammer because it's a really loaded image,"" he told KGMB. Hawaii's homeless problem . The controversy marks the latest chapter in Hawaii's struggle with homelessness. Hawaii has the highest rate of homeless per capita of any state -- about 45 people out of every 10,000, according to the Homelessness Research Institute. The only area with a higher rate is Washington, D.C., at about 113 per 10,000. Beautiful weather and generous public assistance programs have helped attract people to Hawaii; very high housing costs have added to the homelessness levels. One homeless man, Kawika Crowley, ran a long-shot campaign for U.S. Congress in November. In August, the state legislature approved a pilot program to offer plane tickets off the islands for some homeless people. ""We're going to send them back to their family, a strong support network system where they can get back on their feet,"" Rep. John Mizuno said at the time, adding that the plan would ""save our taxpayers a substantial amount of money."" New York and San Francisco have paid to relocate thousands of homeless people in recent years. Brower wants to see Hawaii take other steps, as well. ""I believe we should have some type of homeless campground because a lot of people on the streets, either they don't have the discipline to go to the shelter, or they don't want to,"" he told KITV. CNN's Casey Wian contributed to this report.","Lawmaker Tom Brower took a sledgehammer to abandoned shopping carts .

"Bangkok (CNN) -- The distraught mother of a 13-year-old girl raped and thrown from a sleeper train en route to Bangkok has told of her daughter's dreams for the future, amid angry calls for a mandatory death penalty for child rapists. ""She wanted to be an angel, she wanted to be an air hostess,"" her mother said of Nong Kaem. ""If she was still here I would do everything to support her, but now I have nothing left."" Kaem's sister, one of two who was traveling with her on the overnight train from southern Thailand on Saturday, wrote on Facebook of her guilt at not being able to protect her. ""Kaem, I am so sorry that I failed to look after you. I am a terrible sister. Please forgive me,"" she wrote, according to the Bangkok Post. Journey turned to horror . It was Kaem's first time on a train. She was returning from the city of Surat Thai with her two sisters and one of their boyfriends to the Thai capital Bangkok, a popular route for tourists going to and from the country's popular southern beaches. They were sharing a sleeping carriage, and turned in for the night. By the morning Kaem was gone. Police searched the train and the track as the teenager's frantic family turned to the media for help in finding her. Three days later, her body was found naked near the track; she'd been raped, suffocated and tossed out of a window by her attacker who told police he had been drinking and was high on methamphetamine, according to Police Major General Thanet Soonthornsuk. Tracked down by phone . Police named Kaem's alleged murderer as 22-year-old railway employee Wanchai Saengkhao. They said he confessed to the crime after he was tracked down via his victim's mobile phone. Wanchai sold the girl's phone to a shop owner in Bangkok, who took a copy of his I.D. which was later passed to police. Police said Wanchai admitted carrying the sleeping child to another carriage where he raped and strangled her, before throwing her lifeless body out the window as the train passed through the Pranburi District in Prachuabkirikan Province. Wanchai has been charged with murder, rape of a child under 15 years old and theft, police said. He faces possible execution for the murder charge, but activists are using the case to call for tougher charges for child rape, which currently carries a jail term of four to 20 years and a fine of up to 40,000 baht ($1,200). Rage vented online . The reaction on social media was swift and scathing as angry Thais bombarded Wanchai's Facebook page with abusive messages. The page is no longer available. Junta leader, army chief General Prayuth Chan-ocha, expressed his sorrow, and the former transport minister, Chatchart Sitthipan, said he took the blame for failing to do more when he was in charge of the railway. ""It is the worst news in many years for the State Railway of Thailand and the Ministry of Transport. I feel that I am also responsible for this event, because I did not do my job well enough when I was the Minister,"" Chatchart said. As word spread that Kaem had gone missing, Thai actress and former Miss Thailand, Panadda Wongphudee, posted a message on Instagram urging people to back a campaign to change the law under the slogan, ""Rape, will be executed."" A Change.org petition was set up calling for the tougher penalties -- ""no more sentence reduction, parole or pardon"" -- which at the time of writing had more than 25,000 signatories. There were also calls for State Railway of Thailand governor Prapas Chongsanguan to step down, as officials scrambled to assure passengers the trains were safe. A ban would be slapped on the sale of alcohol on all trains, they said, and background checks would be stepped up for all employees. Are new laws the answer? Amid the anger, some called for calm. ""We have to listen to this news with full consciousness. To design or change a law base on emotions and hatred will never produce effective law. It will only promote more hatred in society,"" said Dejudom Krairit, Chairman of Lawyers Council of Thailand. Writing in the Bangkok Post, columnist Sanitsuda Ekachai said: ""I seriously doubt if the angry calls for the death penalty as the only punishment for child rapists and rapists/murderers will make our society any safer. ""These calls stem from the belief that this heinous crime was possible because the punishment is not heavy enough. This is not new. We hear such calls every time a shocking rape or murder happens.""

"(CNN) -- For five years, Taliban militants held Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl captive. They released images of him from time to time. In one piece of footage, he appeared gaunt, eating slowly. In another, the soldier stood next to a bearded man with a gun and looked at the camera for a moment. Bergdahl's forehead was furrowed, and there appeared to be cuts on his face. Fast forward to late May when the 28-year-old was freed in exchange for five senior Taliban members held by the U.S. military. The news of Bergdahl's freedom initially was met with jubilation, but it quickly turned as many called for an investigation into his disappearance and captivity. Some critics accused the soldier of deserting his comrades in war. Less than two months later, the Army announced Monday that Bergdahl has completed medical care and mental counseling at an Army hospital in San Antonio. He is going to get back to work, the Army said. The soldier will soon take a desk job at Fort Sam Houston, said U.S. Army North spokesman Don Manuszewski . Bergdahl will be assigned to a unit responsible for homeland defense, civil support operations and security cooperation programs involving countries such as Canada, Mexico and the Bahamas. Manuszewski wouldn't offer any details about what Bergdahl will be doing day to day but said the former captive will not be treated ""any different than any other soldier."" When he's not in an office, Bergdahl will live in barracks and share a bathroom with other service members. He'll have his own room, the spokesman said. 'Sponsor' to help Bergdahl readjust . Bergdahl went missing on June 30, 2009, in Afghanistan's Paktika province, where he was deployed with the 1st Battalion, 501st Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division. An Army fact-finding investigation conducted in the months after his disappearance concluded that Bergdahl left his outpost deliberately and of his own free will, according to an official, who was briefed on the report. But there was no definitive conclusion because that would require knowing Bergdahl's intent -- something officials couldn't learn without talking to him, a U.S. military official has said. The last step in the investigation would likely include hearing Bergdahl's account. At Fort Sam Houston, Bergdahl will have a ""sponsor"" to help him adjust to Army life again, Manuszewski said, which he called routine for anyone new at the post. The Army tries to match people who are of a similar age, with a sponsor sometimes being a few ranks above the post newcomer. The New York Times reported Monday that two soldiers will help Bergdahl readjust to Army life. A lot of stress expected for soldier . Just how all this change will feel only Bergdahl will know. But there's little doubt scrutiny of him will be intense and constant, said M. David Rudd, who specializes in mental health trauma. He is a former dean of the University of Utah's College of Social and Behavioral Science and was also the president of the American Association of Suicidology. ""The stress level is going to increase dramatically,"" said Rudd, who is now the president of the University of Memphis. ""The issue of stigma in the military -- the circumstances that surround his disappearance and the questions raised ... are probably going to provoke significant passions"" in other troops. Some fellow soldiers have publicly blasted Bergdahl as a deserter. Longtime war correspondent Mike Boettcher, who has worked in Afghanistan, said he believes Bergdahl is going to have a tough time readjusting. Gunmen kidnapped Boettcher in El Salvador in 1985, and he struggled to regain his footing after being freed. As a reporter covering emotionally wrenching topics, he felt he had to work extra hard to prove he could handle it. ""What you're worried about is how other people think of you,"" Boettcher told CNN on Monday. ""In my own instance, I felt like people were treating me like a fragile egg. So I felt I had something to prove."" For Bergdahl's family, there will be change, too. The casualty assistance workers who helped the service member's relatives during his captivity will conclude their services Monday, Manuszewski said. If Bergdahl's family members need help, they can call the post and ask for it. ""We are treating him the same way we would treat any other person assigned here,"" Manuszewski said. ""If the family called ... we would do what we could to support them."" Col. Timothy Marsano, a spokesman for the family, declined to tell CNN if Bergdahl's new job assignment had brought any kind of communication between the soldier and his family. Since his release, there has not been a reunion, at least a public one. In mid-June, the FBI said it was investigating threats against Bergdahl's parents.

"(CNN) -- The lab mishaps at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are having ""broad impacts,"" compromising care for patients with diseases like tuberculosis and chikungunya and potentially slowing work overseas on Ebola and MERS, according to a CDC official. Multiple improprieties -- including transporting dangerous materials in Ziploc bags and sending a live sample of bird flu to a low-security lab -- prompted CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden last week to instruct his highest-security labs to stop transferring out biological materials. The transfer moratorium means laboratories around the world can no longer depend on the CDC to help them diagnose unusual diseases such as drug-resistant tuberculosis, Middle East respiratory syndrome, Rocky Mountain spotted fever and typhus, said Michael Shaw, deputy director of the CDC's office of infectious diseases. ""The CDC is one of the only places that can diagnose these diseases,"" Shaw said. Hardest hit, health experts say, may be TB patients. Because of the transfer moratorium, some patients have been unable to find out what type of TB they have. That means their doctors don't know which antibiotic to prescribe, according to Kelly Wroblewski, director of infectious disease programs at the Association of Public Health Laboratories. ""The moratorium was the absolute right thing to do; you've got to triple-check all your procedures,"" said Scott Becker, executive director of the association. ""But if this goes on for another week, we're going to have even more problems."" The CDC is one of only three public health labs in the United States that can do quick testing on drug-resistant tuberculosis specimens to see which antibiotic might work the best. The other two, in California and New York, might be able to handle some of the overflow, Wroblewski said. The CDC will also be turning away about 100 samples per week that need to be checked for chikungunya, a mosquito-borne disease that's risen to record levels in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and other parts of the Caribbean, according to Shaw. Doctors in the area have been sending specimens to the CDC to help diagnose the disease, which often has the same symptoms as dengue fever or malaria. Without answers, doctors on the ground will have difficulty knowing how to treat their patients and whether they need to isolate them from other people, Shaw said. The CDC has also stopped a mosquito surveillance program in Gulf Coast states aimed at detecting whether infected bugs are bringing the disease to the continental U.S. State labs in the United States also rely on materials from the CDC to test substances such as white powders that are suspicious for bioterrorism. The labs have enough materials to last a while but at some point will run out. Internationally, labs that are working on the Ebola crisis in Africa and on Middle East respiratory syndrome might see their work slowed down because of the CDC lab situation. Those international labs depend on materials from the CDC to do their work. Shaw said they also currently have enough but might run out soon. The 22 CDC labs under the moratorium are in Atlanta; Anchorage; San Juan, Puerto Rico; and Fort Collins, Colorado. The moratorium will be removed lab by lab as each one can prove that it can operate safely again, and some of the CDC labs might be able to transport materials in a few days, but others might not not be fully operational for months, Shaw said. ""We shouldn't and we won't be doing this work unless we can do it in a safe way,"" he added. ""As soon as each lab can document that policies and procedures and validated protocols are in place, they can resume transporting materials.""","Improprieties lead director to instruct labs to stop transferring out biological materials .

"(Health.com) -- Used to be, when you grabbed breakfast on the go, it was a diet disaster: nothing but fat-and-calorie bombs like butter-soaked croissants and jumbo muffins. Now, it's much easier to do right by your body: Fast-food legends like McDonald's and IHOP, as well as newbies like Cosi and Panera Bread, offer surprisingly healthy options that are filling, light, and much easier on your arteries. The key to finding a healthy breakfast, says Christine Gerbstadt, MD, RD, spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association, is finding a good-for-you mix of complex carbs (like whole grains), protein, and healthy fats to keep you satisfied. So with that in mind, we asked our team of experts to choose and rank the best a.m. grub. Here, the standouts -- and why each one made the cut. 1. Spinach Florentine Breakfast Wrap (Cosi) Meet the breakfast wrap that packs nearly as much protein as a burger. That's an award-worthy benefit: ""When you wake up, your body hasn't had fuel for about 10 to 12 hours,"" says Dr. Gerbstadt, one of our judges. So this standout refuels you and keeps you satisfied so you don't overnosh the rest of the day. ""With most other breakfasts, you would need to add another food to get this much protein,"" Gerbstadt explains. ""Plus, the fiber content is much higher than you'd usually find in such a high-protein meal."" Calories 334; Fat 21g (sat 8g); Protein 24g; Carbohydrate 21g; Fiber 11g; Sodium 516mg . Room for improvement: The fat content is on the high side (since the wrap is made with eggs), so eat low-fat fare throughout the day -- or split this hearty pick with a friend. Health.com: America's top 10 healthiest fast food restaurants . 2. Protein Artisan Snack Plate (Starbucks) This Starbucks sampler scores high for having all the components of an ultra-satisfying breakfast -- protein, fiber, whole grains, and fresh produce, says panelist Frances Largeman-Roth, RD, senior food and nutrition editor at Health magazine. You get to nibble on yummy fare -- hard-boiled egg, cheddar and apple slices, multigrain muesli bread, grapes, and honey peanut butter spread -- in the right portions, Largeman-Roth explains: ""It's like a healthy tapas plate for breakfast."" Calories 370; Fat 19g (sat 6g); Protein 13g; Carbohydrate 36g; Fiber 4g; Sodium 470mg . Room for improvement: Along with all that protein and fiber, you get 19 grams of fat. Tip: Eat half of either the honey peanut butter spread or the cheese. 3. Berry Topper Ideal Meal (Jamba Juice) The name is spot on. ""It really is an ideal meal because it meets all of your nutrient needs,"" says judge and nutrition expert Robin Miller, the host of Quick Fix Meals on the Food Network. It's made with yogurt and soy milk, great sources of calcium and vitamin D two nutrients women often lack. Also blended in are vitamin C--packed strawberries, blueberries, and bananas. And the organic pumpkin flaxseed granola gives you a dose of healthy fats for heart health. Calories 300; Fat 4.5g (sat 0.5g); Protein 9g; Carbohydrate 59g; Fiber 7g; Sodium 85mg (for 12 ounces) Room for improvement: Stick to the small (12-ounce) size -- larger serving sizes load on the calories. Health.com: The best fat-burning breakfasts . 4. Apple Cinnamon Oatmeal (Au Bon Pain) It's no surprise that two oatmeals made our list. Oatmeal is a favorite among dietitians because it contains two kinds of fiber: the insoluble kind, which helps prevent constipation, and the soluble type, which digests slowly to help regulate blood sugar. ""Oatmeal is more filling than many other cereals,"" Gerbstadt explains. Au Bon Pain's oatmeal edged past the McDonald's version (#6) because it has less saturated fat and sodium, plus more protein and fiber. Still, you can't go wrong with either. Calories 280; Fat 4g (sat 1g); Protein 8g; Carbohydrate 56g; Fiber 7g; Sodium 10mg . Room for improvement: The protein content is a bit low: Make it more filling by eating a few nuts or a yogurt on the side. 5. Scrambled Egg Whites, Chicken Sausage, and Fruit (Denny's) Yes, you can have eggs and sausage! But pass over the Grand Slam menu and look for these better-for-you breakfast ""sides"" to design your own morning meal. ""This is a really well-rounded breakfast,"" Largeman-Roth says. It's not too high in sodium, either; a surprise for a sausage breakfast, she says. Calories 230; Fat 9g (sat 0g); Protein 19g; Carbohydrate 19g; Fiber 3g; Sodium 447mg . Room for improvement: Order a piece of whole-grain toast (without butter or margarine) to increase the fiber factor, adding about 100 more calories. Health.com: 7 breakfasts under 300 calories . 6. Fruit & Maple Oatmeal (McDonald's) The judges praised McDonald's for adding this good-for-you pick with fresh fruit to its menu (breakfast antioxidants at the drive-through -- nice). This tasty treat includes diced green and red apples, dried cranberries, raisins, a touch of cream, and brown sugar. Plus oatmeal's soluble fiber helps lower cholesterol and control blood sugar, helping to fight off diabetes, Largeman-Roth says. Calories 260; Fat 4.5g (sat 1.5g); Protein 7g; Carbohydrate 48g; Fiber 5g; Sodium 115mg (for oatmeal without brown sugar) Room for improvement: Watching calories? Order it without the brown sugar to save 30 calories. ""You won't miss it with all the fruity flavors,"" Largeman-Roth explains. 7. Simple & Fit Veggie Omelette (IHOP) A veggie omelette is a great way to sneak more nutrient- and fiber-rich produce into your power breakfast, Miller says. In this case you get a flavor-fest of green peppers, mushrooms, onions, and oven-roasted tomatoes. ""And the side of fruit adds a nice (sweet) touch,"" she says. Calories 320; Fat 10g (sat 1g); Protein 21g; Carbohydrate 40g; Fiber 8g; Sodium 420mg . Room for improvement: This omelette is made with ""egg substitute"" (which contains mostly egg whites); if you prefer the real thing, ask your server to substitute egg whites instead. Health.com: 5 shortcuts to a heart-healthy diet . 8. Western Egg White & Cheese Muffin Melt (Subway) For just 160 calories, this melt with egg whites, Black Forest ham, green peppers, American and Monterey Jack cheeses, and red onion stacked on an English muffin lets you eat light without feeling even a little bit deprived. Don't like peppers or onions? Order your melt with fresh tomatoes and spinach instead. If you want something more substantial, round out your meal with Subway's packaged apple slices or yogurt. Calories 160; Fat 4g (sat 1.5g); Protein 15g; Carbohydrate 19g; Fiber 5g; Sodium 680mg . Room for improvement: This pick didn't show up higher on our list because the sodium count is high. 9. Egg White Turkey Sausage Wake-Up Wrap (Dunkin' Donuts) No need to deprive yourself if you're watching calories and fat: The reduced-fat cheddar cheese, egg whites, spinach, and turkey sausage in this winner from Dunkin' Donuts make this a healthy indulgence. Calories 150; Fat 5g (sat 2.5g); Protein 11g; Carbohydrate 14g; Fiber 1g; Sodium 400mg . Room for improvement: This pick tastes rich, but it's small, so it may not keep you full for as long as the egg options higher on our list, Largeman-Roth explains. It's also low in filling fiber, so pair it with a piece of fruit for more fuel. Health.com: America's healthiest mall food . 10. Breakfast Power Sandwich (Panera Bread) This egg, Vermont white cheddar, and smoked lean ham sandwich serves up as much protein as a 3.5-ounce fish fillet, Gerbstadt says. Also praiseworthy, she adds, is Panera's whole-grain bread. Made of rye, spelt, amaranth, and flax, it's brimming with good-for-you nutrients like vitamin B2, niacin, manganese, iron, magnesium, and selenium. Calories 330; Fat 14g (sat 6g); Protein 22g; Carbohydrate 31g; Fiber 4g; Sodium 830mg. Room for improvement: ""This sandwich has a lot of sodium,"" Largeman-Roth notes. But you can slash 300 milligrams simply by ordering it without the smoked ham. Copyright Health Magazine 2011 .","Some items from Panera Bread serve up as much protein as a 3.5-ounce fish fillet .

"(CNN) -- The mother of late ""Glee"" actor Cory Monteith has opened up for the first time about the death of her son. Monteith's mother, Ann McGregor, sat down with ABC's ""Good Morning America"" on Thursday, saying that she's only recently been able to come to terms with Monteith's passing. On July 13, 2013, Monteith was found dead in a Vancouver hotel room at age 31. A coroner later ruled he died from a lethal mix of heroin and alcohol. It has been within only the past few days, McGregor said, that she's ""beginning to accept it."" ""The loss is horrendous,"" McGregor told ""GMA."" ""Until three days ago, I couldn't look at a picture of Cory. So there's been progress."" McGregor has kept in touch with Monteith's on-and-off-screen love interest, Lea Michele, and said the actress reaches out to her via text messages and e-mails. ""She's hurting, too,"" McGregor said. ""I see the sadness; I know her pain."" Monteith, who came to fame on Fox's ""Glee"" as the affable jock Finn Hudson, had a known history of substance abuse. He said in a 2011 interview with Parade magazine that he began using drugs at age 13, and by 19, he was sent to rehab. Three months before his death in 2013, Monteith voluntarily checked himself into a treatment center to seek help for substance abuse. Looking back, Monteith's mother said her son was struggling with ""a lot of emotional things he was trying to figure out,"" including his relationship with his father. When ""Cory was 15, he did a code blue. I think that was the turning point,"" McGregor told ""GMA."" ""I remember after Cory's first OD, the drive we took. All I did was stare into his eyes and hug him and look at him, because I had this feeling (of), 'I really want to know him, because I'm not going to have him my entire life.' "" For those in similar situations who would look to McGregor for advice, she responded that she isn't sure she has the answers. ""I don't think we have power to change the choices they're making,"" she said. ""I think with the kind of connection Cory and I had, if we couldn't prevent that situation, I don't have the answer. What could I say to them? Live every moment.""","The mother of ""Glee"" actor Cory Monteith appears on ""Good Morning America""

"(CNN) -- Forget the new black. This is the real black. A British nanotech company has created what it says is the world's darkest material. It is so dark the human eye can't discern its shape and form, creating what has been called a black hole. Vantablack, made out of carbon nanotubes, is designed by Surrey NanoSystems and absorbs 99.96% of all light that hits it. Conventional black, such as black paint or fabric, absorbs between 95% and 98% of light. The company says Vantablack was the darkest material ever tested by the National Physical Laboratory in the UK, as well as the Institute of Standards and Technology in the U.S. The material is made up of millions of carbon nanotubes, each measuring two or three nanometers -- or roughly one millionth of a millimeter. It is grown on aluminium foil. Creases and bumps on the foil are easily picked up by the human eye. But once covered with Vantablack, all wrinkles and roughness seem to disappear. ""Some people describe it as a hole, because there is literally not enough light coming from the surface to allow the eye to discern the contours that are in that foil,"" Surrey NanoSystem's Steve Northam told CNN. Sound like the ultimate slimming little black dress? Actually, no. A Vantablack dress would render the curves and contours of the human body invisible and cause ""the wearer to look like a two-dimensional cardboard cut out,"" Northam said. Instead, the material is designed to help air-borne cameras, telescopes and infrared scanning systems work more efficiently by reducing stray light. Military clients are lining up to buy it, as is the space industry. The benefits, Northam said, are that ""your systems can see fainter objects further away, you improve the sensitivity and you improve the signal to noise ratio in these systems."" The material, whose development was backed by the UK's Technology Strategy Board, was launched at this year's Farnborough Airshow in southern England. According to Ben Jensen, chief technology officer of Surrey NanoSystems, it was a ""major breakthrough by UK industry in the application of nanotechnology to optical instrumentation."" So far, Surrey NanoSystems has only grown Vantablack on foil. It plans to grow it different materials and on three dimensional shapes. Read more: Britain's spaceport ambitions revealed .

"(CNN) -- Historically the hometown dates on ""The Bachelorette"" can be fraught with a touch of anxiety, but on Monday night's episode there was an abundance of grief. The ABC reality series dealt with the death of contestant Eric Hill, who perished in a paragliding accident following his stint on the show. Hill was one of 25 bachelors vying for the heart of Andi Dorfman. Dorfman visited the hometowns of the four remaining contestants, but the show took a dramatic turn when host Chris Harrison had to inform the group of Hill's passing. ""I know this is a little unorthodox,"" Harrison said. ""You all know Eric Hill. He, a couple of days ago, was in Utah paragliding and was in a serious accident. We knew he was hurt bad, but we just didn't know how bad. We learned this morning that he passed away. Obviously I'm really sorry to be the one to have to tell you. But as soon as we found out, I definitely wanted every one of you guys to know as fast as we could."" Dorfman broke down in tears and one of the bachelors, Marcus Grodd, had to leave the room. Dorfman was later shown sobbing and lamenting the fact that Hill was eliminated from the show after the pair had a disagreement. ""I kicked him out,"" she said. ""I can't believe that was my last conversation with him."" Dorfman also rallied to help the others deal with the tragedy. ""It just puts in perspective all of this -- there's so much more to all of this,"" she told them. ""There's life, people have lives here."" In his blog about the show for EW, Harrison defended the decision to include the heartbreak in the episode. ""There were those who didn't think we should shoot it at all and not include this news,"" he wrote. ""I vehemently disagreed. I thought we should not only shoot it, but felt we should include it on this show for you to see as well. I knew this was going to be a brutally sad moment for all of us, but that's why I felt so strongly we should show it.""","Andi Dorfman learned of Eric Hill's death on Monday's episode .

"(CNN) -- Two Amish girls, who were apparently abducted from a roadside farm stand in upstate New York, have been found and are safe, authorities said early Friday. An Amber Alert was issued late Wednesday in Oswegatchie for Delila Miller, 6, and her sister, Fannie, 12. They had been selling vegetables near their family farm, located about 50 miles southeast of the Canadian border. A witness told police the girls were tending to a customer who drove up in a white 4-door sedan and disappeared when the vehicle pulled away, according to the Amber Alert. Rhonda Wells, senior dispatcher for St. Lawrence County Sheriff, told CNN early Friday that the girls had been located and were safe. She declined to provide further details, saying a press release will be issued later Friday. The Amber Alert has been canceled. St. Lawrence County Sheriff Kevin Wells had said Thursday at a news conference that multiple agencies were investigating leads called in by the public. Pictures of the girls were not available because members of the Amish community forbid photos of themselves, which they see as a violation of their religious beliefs. ""I wouldn't say it's hindering the investigation, it's just that it would be helpful"" to have photos, Wells said. ""In the Amish world, photos aren't going to be available.""

"ST. PETERSBURG, Florida (CNN) -- It's a community that seems serene, with just a wind chime breaking the silence. But look again and you will see many residents wearing ankle monitor systems that alert authorities if they wander too far away. Nearly half the residents of the Palace trailer park are convicted sex offenders. The Palace Mobile Home Park is a place that welcomes sex offenders. Ninety-five of these 200 residents are convicted sex offenders, including some pedophiles. The adults-only, nondescript, low-income trailer park near St. Petersburg, Florida has gained a reputation among sex offenders on probation as a good place to live and stay out of trouble. ""Out there ... it's a jungle,"" said Michael, who did not want his last name used for this report. ""In here, it's our own little piece of paradise. We're safe here."" Michael was released from prison in June. He's been a familiar face to law enforcement in Florida and Mississippi for the past 20 years, serving prison time for grand theft, drug possession and sexual battery on a child. ""I pray a lot that my victim has been given the opportunity to grow beyond the horrendous problem that I caused for them,"" he said. In many ways, the Palace provides him a second chance at life. New laws across the country have limited where sex offenders and predators can live, banning them from places where children might congregate. This trailer park is far enough away from schools, churches, playgrounds and bus stops, allowing Michael to call it home without running afoul of the law.   Watch ""there's no better place"" than here » . ""As a sex offender -- when you come out, you're told you can't do this; you can't be around children; you can't go to parks; you can't go to the beach; you can't go to the library,"" he said. Nearly 600 sex offenders have lived here in the past couple of years, according to manager Nancy Morais, who said she was sexually assaulted by a family member as a little girl. Not only does she allow the sex offenders to live here, she also offers therapy to help them become part of society again. ""Put him on the right track, and we have a better chance of seeing society be a little bit safer with this person,"" she said. ""Can I guarantee they're all gonna be good? Of course not."" Some experts agree that it is hope as much as fear that keeps offenders from relapsing. ""You have to offer people hope if you expect them to change,"" said psychologist Don Sweeney, who works with the residents here. ""If society only wants to tear them down and doesn't show them any way back, then all help is lost in their minds, and they are more likely to relapse."" Morais is allowed by the trailer park's owner to house the offenders. The owner, The R2 Property Company, would not talk to CNN for this story. Morais said she carefully screens all her potential ""guests,"" even with their unsavory pasts. ""If they come into our program, I would look them close in the eye and will tell them very clearly: 'You want to do good? I will do whatever I can to help you do good,'"" she said. ""'You mess up, I'm not gonna cry when you are handcuffed and they are taking you away.'"" Morais charges each offender $400 per month, which includes all utilities. Most have roommates, with up to three or four per trailer. But not everyone who lives here feels safe knowing they are surrounded by convicted sex offenders. One resident, who asked not to be identified, railed against the trailer park's management for not informing them from the outset about this rehabilitation program. ""They told us nothing. My place is worth nothing now,"" the resident said, speaking in a whisper. Another woman said she had no problem living among the offenders, but she said it comes with consequences: She won't allow her grandchildren on the premises. Others don't seem to mind. Teresa Atkins moved into the Palace a year ago. She is not an offender and didn't know, at the time, that almost half of her neighbors were. ""I'm very safe here. None of these men want to go back to jail. They will do anything to keep from going to jail,"" she said. Because of the number of sex offenders, there is a constant police presence in the park. ""We make sure that they know we are going to be an influence in here,"" said Sgt. Judy Vovan, who supervises the Sexual Predator and Offender Tracking unit for the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office. ""They're gonna see us in here very, very frequently, and we're gonna make sure they are abiding by the registration requirements."" On this particular day, Vovan and deputy Tammy Nixon are going door to door at the Palace. They ensure that all offenders are properly registered. The deputies said more offenders are coming to the park from all over Florida. ""There are people living in this park that have no ties to Pinellas County. We are very much aware of that,"" said Vovan. Across the trailer park, Bill Sylvis, the maintenance supervisor, is sanding down a two-by-four. Morais hired him to do repairs at the aging, rundown facility, when he was released from prison in January for sexual assault of a child under 16. ""I was gonna do whatever it took, get my own little cabinet shop, furniture shop going,"" he said, speaking through a microphone he holds up to his throat. Cancer took away his ability to speak. But no one would hire him, he said. ""We're the bottom of the barrel. They don't want us around. They feel insecure, whatever, unsafe you know."" So far, only one offender who has lived here has re-offended, according to authorities. That man tried to set up a photo shoot with a child on the property. One of his neighbors, a fellow sexual offender, turned him in. E-mail to a friend .","95 of 200 residents of Florida trailer park are convicted sex offenders .

"(CNN) -- Anytime I hear about a death that may be linked to addiction, I am reminded that this is a misunderstood and deadly disease. Deaths caused by addiction have risen astronomically in the past decade. Drug overdose is now the No.1 cause of accidental death in the United States; more common than death by car accidents. ""Glee"" actor Cory Monteith, who was found dead at a Vancouver hotel on Saturday, had said that he struggled with substance abuse since his teenage years. The British Columbia Coroners Service said he died as a result of ""a mixed drug toxicity, involving heroin and alcohol."" Whenever someone with addiction dies, I grieve the lost potential and wonder about the limitations of our ability to address this cunning, baffling and powerful disease. I am also humbled by my own experience with addiction and recovery, and grateful for the help I received. It seems nearly impossible to believe that people with addiction would continue to use drugs and alcohol to the point of death, but that is what people with addiction do: They deny both the consequences and the risks of using. As we continue to learn about addiction, we're understanding more about why addicted people behave the way they do. But that's little solace for friends and family. Addiction is a brain disease, and our knowledge of it has expanded significantly, which has informed our treatment programs and altered our perceptions. We know that addiction resides in the limbic system, a subconscious part of our brain that is involved with memory, emotion and reward. Replacing addiction with a healthy obsession . We refer to this area of the brain as the reward center, as it ensures that all rewarding or reinforcing activities, especially those associated with our survival, are prioritized. The reward center makes sure we survive by eating, drinking fluids, having sex (for survival of the species) and maintaining human interactions. In late stages of addiction we can see how reward-related drives, especially those for survival, are reprioritized when people risk their families, their jobs, even their lives to continue to use drugs and alcohol. The continued use of the drug becomes the most important drive, at a subconscious level and unrecognized by the individual, undermining even life itself. When a methamphetamine-addicted mother makes the nightly news after neglecting her children for four days while on a meth run, we can't comprehend how anyone could do such a thing and tend to think she does not love her children. She may have been going out for groceries with the intent to return home and feed her children, but ran into a dealer and started using. Addiction took over, and she was driven by subconscious forces even though she loves her children as much as I love mine. Her love and her natural instincts to care for and nurture her children were overridden by her own brain, the reward system reprogrammed to seek and use drugs at all costs. Unbeknownst to her, drug use has become the most important thing in her life. When we witness the incomprehensible behaviors associated with addiction we need to remember these people have a disease, one that alters their brains and their behaviors. We tend to believe we all have free will, so it is difficult to understand how the addicts' perception has been so altered as to drive them to destruction. 5 damaging myths about addiction . We also assume they can make their own decisions, especially when it comes to help for their addiction. In so doing we are expecting the person with a diseased brain to accept the unacceptable, that the continued use of drugs is not providing relief from the problem -- it is the problem, and they need to stop that which has become paramount. They are unable to make such decisions because their brains have been altered to prioritize use of the drugs, even above survival itself. Relief of psychic pain, the real, unimaginable pain of addiction, is part of the problem. People have many reasons for seeking relief from pain; some pain precedes the addiction, but most pain is the result of the addiction. The addicted neglect their primary relationships and they may lie, cheat and steal to continue drug use. And they know this at some level, they recognize their uncontrolled behaviors, but they can't change, they can't stop. Hopelessness becomes a way of life. Self-loathing, shame and guilt become the norm as the consequences of continued drug use accumulate. They use drugs to ease the pain, but the very remedy exacerbates the problem. The answer to their dilemma goes unrecognized due to the neurobiological changes that have occurred in their brains. From drug addict to yoga instructor . The good news is that treatment is effective and specifically designed to help people recognize the problem within. Most people are coerced into treatment for one reason or another; they may be facing legal issues, job loss or divorce. With good treatment their likelihood for recovery and abstinence is just as good as the minority who seek treatment of their own accord. Unfortunately, fewer than 10% of those with addiction recognize they have it and seek treatment. This is the primary reason people don't seek help. Our largest public health problem goes unrecognized by those with the disease. Every one of these deaths is tragic. They died of a disease that lies to them. Great talent and intelligence do not protect us from any illness. We can safely watch such a tragedy, gawking as we drive by the destruction, insulated from the suffering and unable to help. But addiction is all around us and we need to respond to the rising death toll. All of us are responsible for learning the truth about addiction, raising awareness and intervening for those who have this disease, knowing they are unlikely to be able to do so for themselves.

"(CNN) -- The International Criminal Court on Monday granted the court's chief prosecutor permission to open an investigation into possible war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Ivory Coast during months of post-election turmoil last year. In his application to the judges for authorization in June, prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo cited sources who said at least 3,000 people were killed, 72 people disappeared and 520 others were subject to arbitrary arrest and detentions since the November 28 election that resulted in dispute. Incumbent Laurent Gbagbo refused to cede power even though challenger Alassane Ouattara was recognized as the winner. Months of bloodshed ensued, the political stalemate settled by Gbagbo's capture in April. The prosecutor's office said sources also reported 100 cases of rape, though the number of unreported incidents is thought to be considerably higher. The court said this was the first time it may open a case in a nation that is not a party to the Rome Statute, the treaty that established the International Criminal Court. But Ivory Coast has accepted the jurisdiction of the court. Human Rights Watch has urged the court to go beyond the latest wave of violence and look into other possible crimes committed during years of conflict and civil war. The global monitoring group said human rights abuses began with violence-marred elections in 2000 and continued in a subsequent armed conflict. It said cases of murder, sexual violence and the use of child soldiers have been documented under the control of Gbagbo and the current prime minister, Guillaume Soro. ""No one has been credibly prosecuted for the crimes during this period, and a 2004 U.N. Commission of Inquiry report on crimes during the 2002-2003 conflict also has been kept secret,"" a Human Rights Watch statement said over the summer. Regardless of actions taken by the International Criminal Court, fair and impartial domestic trials will be of utmost importance, the rights group said.","The prosecutor asked the judges to authorize a probe .

"(CNN) -- The crowdfunding model, in which entrepreneurs seek online pledges to finance their pet projects, appears to be alive and well. Kickstarter, the platform that has helped launch the Pebble smartwatch, the Oculus Rift gaming headset and the upcoming ""Veronica Mars"" movie, said it surpassed $1 billion in pledges on Monday. Although Kickstarter has been around for almost five years, it said more than half of the money was pledged in the past 12 months. ""$1 billion means that people care about new ideas,"" said the company in a special page announcing the milestone. The money helped bankroll 57,000 creative projects, from films and comic books to tech gadgets and video games. Pledges came from 5.7 million people in 224 countries, most commonly the United States ($663 million), the UK ($54 million) and Canada ($45 million). That's a far cry from Kickstarter's first day -- April 28, 2009 -- when a grand total of 40 people pledged $1,084 to seven projects. Kickstarter's top 50 projects: When they shipped .

"(CNN) -- An international judge has resigned from the special court set up in Cambodia to try people accused of committing atrocities under the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s, saying his Cambodian counterpart was obstructing efforts to investigate cases. The resignation by Laurent Kasper-Ansermet, announced Monday, is the second departure of an international judge from the court in the past six months amid tensions with local officials. His predecessor, Siegfried Blunk, resigned as international co-investigating judge in October, complaining that statements by Cambodian government ministers about two of the court's cases threatened to undermine proceedings. Those same two cases, known as Cases 003 and 004, are at the heart of the dispute between Kasper-Ansermet and You Bunleng, the national co-investigating judge for the court. ""Judge You Bunleng's active opposition to investigations into Cases 003 and 004 has led to a dysfunctional situation,"" Kasper-Ansermet said in a statement attributed to him on the court's website. Prosecutors for the court filed submissions in September 2009 asking the judges to begin investigating five people, whose names have not been disclosed publicly. The submissions were divided into Cases 003 and 004. Based on a French concept, the two investigating judges of the court, one international and one Cambodian, are responsible for collecting evidence to decide whether people charged by prosecutors should be brought to trial. Kasper-Ansermet, a Swiss citizen, said You Bunleng had ""constantly contested"" his authority to investigate the two cases. He said You Bunleng had refused to discuss the cases with him during an informal meeting and had also issued written orders to him demanding that he immediately cease his ""unlawful activity."" Kasper-Ansermet ""considers that the present circumstances no longer allow him to properly and freely perform his duties,"" according to the statement, which said his resignation will take effect May 4. You Bunleng was not immediately available for comment on the matter. The tribunal, known as the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, began its work in 2007 after a decade of on-and-off negotiations between the United Nations and Cambodia over the structure and functioning of the court. In 2010, it issued its first verdict, convicting Kaing Guek Eav, commonly known by his alias, Duch, of war crimes, crimes against humanity, murder and torture. At least 1.7 million people -- nearly a quarter of Cambodia's population -- died under the 1975-1979 Khmer Rouge regime from execution, disease, starvation and overwork, according to the Documentation Center of Cambodia. Opening statements in the court's second trial, Case 002, began in November. In that trial, four former Khmer Rouge government ministers face charges of crimes against humanity and genocide.","Two international judges have resigned in the past 6 months from the court .

"(CNN) -- Along with ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,"" ""The Purge: Anarchy"" may be one of the summer's sequels that actually improves on the original. The follow-up to 2013's horror flick ""The Purge,"" ""Anarchy"" raises the stakes just enough to get critics' attention. As with its predecessor, the thriller is set in a near future when the U.S. government allows for a 12-hour ""purge"": a time period when the populace can do all the awful, horrible stuff they want with no consequences. Yep, that includes murder. Though the first film was written from the perspective of a wealthy family barricaded in their home, the sequel shifts to where the action is: the violence outside. Written and directed by James DeMonaco, who also oversaw ""The Purge,"" ""Anarchy"" follows a group of five individuals who find themselves stuck in the middle of the chaos, not wanting to maim anyone but just to stay alive. The result, says The New York Times' Manohla Dargis, is a ""satisfyingly creepy, blunt, down-and-dirty thriller, one of those follow-ups that improves on the original."" The Hollywood Reporter agreed, writing in its review that "" 'The Purge: Anarchy' efficiently exploits its high-concept premise while delivering far more visceral thrills than its predecessor. Like it or not, a new franchise seems to have been born."" USA Today would put ""The Purge: Anarchy"" directly into the ""B-movie"" category, noting that while ""the film is rutted with plot holes, lapses in logic and tin-eared dialogue,"" the ""jarring action and outlandish premise of a lawless free-for-all are somehow riveting and inane in almost equal measures."" About those plot holes: One of the most obvious to The Washington Post is the movie's concept that the annual purge has turned into something more akin to ""The Hunger Games,"" where the upper-class target the less fortunate for fun and the government uses the 12-hour killing spree as an opportunity to weed those deemed undesirable out of society. It might make for a fun horror flick, but the logic doesn't add up, the paper critiques. ""This, of course, makes no economic sense, since killing your own workers is an even stupider business strategy than underpaying them -- and a sure-fire path to the poorhouse,"" the Post review says. ""The film defies one of the fundamental rules of capitalism: Exploitation of the proletariat may be well and good, but don't execute them all."" Story troubles aside, ""The Purge: Anarchy"" is expected to do fairly well at the box office on opening weekend. With $2.61 million in the bag from Thursday night showings, predictions are circling a box office haul of about $30 million come Monday.","""The Purge: Anarchy"" is the sequel to 2013's ""The Purge""

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A shot rings out, but the burqa-clad woman sitting on the rocky ground does not respond. The man pointing a rifle at her from a few feet away lets loose another round, but still there is no reaction. He fires a third shot, and finally the woman slumps backwards. But the man fires another shot. And another. And another. Nine shots in all. Around him, dozens of men on a hillside cheer: ""God is great!"" Officials in Afghanistan, where the amateur video was filmed, believe the woman was executed because two Taliban commanders had a dispute over her, according to the governor of the province where the killing took place. Both apparently had some kind of relationship with the woman, said Parwan province governor Abdul Basir Salangi. ""In order to save face,"" they accused her of adultery, Salangi said. Then they ""faked a court to decide about the fate of this woman and in one hour, they executed the woman,"" he added. Both Taliban commanders were subsequently killed by a third Taliban commander, Salangi said. ""We went there to investigate and we are still looking for people who were involved in this brutal act,"" he said. It is not clear from the video when it was filmed. The killing took place in the village of Qimchok, not far north of the capital Kabul. Lawmaker Fawzia Koofi called it a huge backward step for women's issues in Afghanistan. ""I think we will have to do something serious about this, we will have to do something as women, but also as human beings,"" she said. ""She didn't even say one word to defend herself."" Koofi wept on Saturday as she watched the video of the execution. The United States condemned the killing ""in the strongest possible terms,"" calling it a ""cold-blooded murder."" ""The protection of women's rights is critical around the world, but especially in Afghanistan, where such rights were ignored, attacked and eroded under Taliban rule,"" the American embassy said in a statement on Sunday. The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan also condemned the execution. ""Let's be clear, this wasn't justice, this was murder, and an atrocity of unspeakable cruelty,"" ISAF commander Gen. John Allen said in a statement Sunday. ""The Taliban's continued brutality toward innocent civilians, particularly women, must be condemned in the strongest terms. There has been too much progress made by too many brave Afghans, especially on the part of women, for this kind of criminal behavior to be tolerated."" The public execution is the latest and among the most shocking examples of violence against women in Afghanistan, but it is far from an isolated case. The Taliban also does not have a monopoly on the violence, cautioned Christine Fair, with the Center for Peace and Security Studies at Georgetown University. ""It's really important to not see this exclusively in terms of the Taliban, but this is a set of practices that actually have existed and continue to exist throughout Afghanistan,"" she said. Nearly nine out of 10 women suffer physical, sexual, or psychological violence or forced marriage at least once in their lifetimes, Human Rights Watch said in its 2012 annual report. The country has 14 shelters for abused women, a number which the campaign group says ""does not meet even a small fraction of the need."" Hundreds of students and teachers at girls' schools in the country have been hospitalized with suspected poisoning this year alone. Girls were forbidden to go to school when the Taliban ruled the country from 1996 to 2001. Salangi, the provincial governor, spoke to CNN about the killing on Sunday, the same day that representatives of more than 80 nations and organizations met to consider pouring billions more aid dollars into the country. U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon urged delegates including U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton not to demand complex reforms in exchange for the money. ""Afghan institutions are still in their nascent stages,"" he said. ""The very programs which offer the best hope of sustainability of Afghan institutions should not be held hostage to complex preconditions."" Clinton said donors at the conference pledged about $16 billion for Afghanistan over four years. That amount did not include money from the United States because any foreign aid must be approved by Congress. Under a security pact with Afghanistan, nearly all U.S.-led NATO troops will withdraw from the country by the end of 2014. ""We can ask the question what will happen when we leave, but let's remember that this is actually happening while we're still there,"" said Fair, with Georgetown. CNN's Richard Allen Greene, Chelsea J. Carter and Sara Sidner, and journalist Ruhullah Khapalwak contributed to this story.","The NATO-led ISAF and the United States condemn the execution .

"Giglio, Italy (CNN) -- The complex operation to refloat the wrecked Costa Concordia cruise ship continued Tuesday -- but the family of the final missing victim still must wait several days for the vessel to be searched for his remains. The last time anyone saw Russel Rebello alive, he was near the stern of the Costa Concordia, helping passengers into rescue boats. But the 33-year-old waiter from India never escaped the doomed cruise ship. And he's the only victim of the 2012 accident whose remains haven't been found. Officials told reporters Tuesday that the vessel would only be searched for Rebello's remains once it reaches its final destination, the Italian port of Genoa. The seabed is being searched and those searches will intensify when the ship is gone, they said. Salvage crews began the arduous task of refloating the ship on Monday morning so they can move it from its resting place off Giglio Island to Genoa to be dismantled. On Tuesday, they began the process of lowering steel hollow boxes, or sponsons, which will be pumped full of compressed air to help lift the vessel further. Divers also began attaching more chains and cables to reinforce the bottom of the boat. Once that's done, they'll raise the ship deck by deck, clearing any debris along the way. After the ship is completely floated, a convoy of 10 boats will then begin a potentially treacherous journey. The vessel will be towed -- slowly and carefully -- 240 kilometers (150 miles) to Genoa, where it will be broken up. It's been more than 2Â½ years since the ship ran aground off Italy's Giglio Island with more than 4,200 passengers aboard, killing 32 people in a disaster that drew global attention. Clean-up job . Reporters were told at a briefing Tuesday that the salvage process was all under control. Initial surveillance by remotely operated underwater vehicles showed no visible cracks or fissures on the bottom of the ship. This had been a concern because if repairs were needed, the operation would have been delayed. Additional structural checks are now under way, with the salvage crews' efforts expected largely to focus over the next two days on the parts of the rotting hulk that remain under water. The project's chief engineer, Franco Porcellacchia of Costa Crociere, the firm that owns the Concordia, said Tuesday it was most likely that the ship would start its final journey on Monday. Officials have said it will take five to six days for the vessel to reach Genoa once it gets going. Porcellacchia also said the crews ""have a commitment to clean the (sea) bottom to the best that we can."" This will include the removal of sediment around the hulk and the underwater salvage platforms and cement bags used to support it when it was rotated to an upright position last year. The crew will start to clean up once the ship is gone but are accepting tenders for removal companies to speed up the process. That bid will be awarded in August, with the removal process expected to take a year or more. Giglio Mayor Sergio Ortelli said he was satisfied with the results so far of tests on water quality around the ship. The decision to undertake the expensive and difficult process of refloating the Costa Concordia, rather than trying to dismantle it on site, was taken because of environmental concerns. Italy's Environment Minister Gian Luca Galletti said Monday it was too risky to leave the vessel there for another year. Captain on trial . Since the wreck two years ago, 24 metric tons of debris -- including furniture, dishes, food, personal effects and ship parts -- have been recovered from the seabed. While salvage crews continue efforts to deal with the wreckage, Francesco Schettino, the ship's captain, is on trial on charges of manslaughter, causing a maritime disaster and abandoning ship with passengers still on board. He denies wrongdoing. Search teams thought they had found Rebello's remains in October. But the body divers found turned out to be that of Maria Grazia Trecarichi, a Sicilian who was on the cruise to celebrate her 50th birthday with her 17-year-old daughter, who survived. In a Facebook post, brother Kevin Rebello said he was watching the latest salvage operation live online, since he couldn't make it to Giglio. ""I strongly believe that they will find the body of my dear brother,"" he said. Nine things to know about the plan to salvage the Costa Concordia .

"(CNN) -- A Florida woman's dog is recovering Saturday after it plunged 15 stories down an air conditioning vent the night before. The fact that Susie -- a 4-year-old Maltipoo -- survived in the first place is nothing short of ""a miracle,"" according the emergency vet who treated her. Dr. Spencer L. Ratnoff said Susie suffered no internal bleeding or broken bones, ""another miracle,"" he said. Susie's fall occurred Friday evening when she and owner Elaine Caralis were visiting a neighbor on the 16th floor of her Fort Lauderdale high-rise. After walking inside the apartment, Susie followed a scent into an open closet, Caralis said. But that's when something went terribly wrong. ""(Susie) walked into the closet and fell down into the exhaust shaft,"" she said. She thinks a ventilation panel that would have normally concealed the breach was missing. Timothy Heiser of Fort Lauderdale Fire Rescue said responders ""cut holes above and below the second floor to try to get (to her)."" He said a fire crew ""eventually managed to get close enough to the pup to remove her from the shaft before she could fall any further."" Caralis called rescuers' efforts over the three harrowing hours ""heroic."" ""I don't have children,"" the 68-year-old Caralis told CNN, ""so Susie is my life, Susie is my family. They treated it like they were searching for a human being."" An ambulance rushed Susie to Oakland Park Animal Hospital, where a waiting Ratnoff feared the worst. ""I'm thinking 15 stories, there are going to be multiple fractures, severe internal injuries or worse,"" he said. ""I was worried it might need to be euthanized."" But Ratnoff said Susie was alert and conscious upon arrival, and despite some serious bruising, is expected to make a full recovery. Her shaken owner echoed the doctor's assessment.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- A CNN correspondent on Monday angrily rejected a report by the Fox network that he and other journalists were used as human shields by Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to prevent a missile attack on his compound. The Fox story, labeled ""exclusive"" and posted on the Fox website Monday, said the presence of news crews from CNN, Reuters and other organizations forced a British aircraft to call off firing seven Storm Shadow missiles at the area that already had been hit. ""Officials from Libya's Ministry of Information brought those journalists to the area to show them damage from the initial attack and to effectively use them as human shields,"" said the Fox report. According to the Fox story, the curtailed strike ""led to a great deal of consternation by coalition commanders."" Nic Robertson, a veteran CNN correspondent who was part of the CNN crew cited in the Fox story, called the rival network's report ""outrageous and hypocritical."" Robertson said a Fox staffer was among the journalists on the trip -- a fact left out of the Fox report -- and that the journalists in the group were hurried through their trip by their minders. ""To say it was a human shield is nuts,"" Robertson said, later adding: ""I expect lies from the government here. I don't expect it from other journalists. It's frankly incredibly disappointing."" There was no immediate response from Fox to a CNN request for comment. The incident involved a trip Sunday night arranged by Libyan authorities to the Gadhafi compound that had been bombed earlier by coalition forces. Robertson said the 40 or so journalists on the bus weren't told ahead of time where they were going, and that there was no attempt by the Libyan minders to restrict anyone from getting on or off the bus before they left. Upon arrival, the journalists spent about 20 minutes at the damaged building and then were hurried to a tent where they waited with Gadhafi supporters for him to appear, Robertson said. Gadhafi never showed up, and the journalists went back to their bus and departed, according to Robertson. A government official even pushed him onto the bus as he tried to broadcast a live shot at the end, Robertson said. ""If they wanted to use us as human shields ... they would have kept us there longer,"" Robertson said. ""That's not what happened."" Robertson noted that the sole participant on the trip from Fox wasn't normally a reporter or videographer, but was given a camera and told to go along. In general, Robertson said, the Fox team in Tripoli rarely goes on the reporting trips arranged by the government. The CNN team goes in order to get whatever information it can to assess what happened and compare it to government versions of events, he said. Otherwise, he noted, the journalists are dependent on government-edited videotape that likely omits key details. For example, U.S. officials called the Gadhafi compound a legitimate target because it included command and control capability, Robertson noted. ""We want to go and see: Is it a command and control system? What are the telltale signs there that the government wouldn't want us to see?"" Robertson said.","Fox says journalists including a CNN crew were used as human shields in Libya .

"(CNN) -- ""I love to suffer,"" says extreme surf photographer Chris Burkard. That much is clearly evident from his incredible portfolio (see photo gallery below left), built up from shooting surfers as they ride waves in some of the most extreme places on the planet. The California-based photographer hikes glaciers, dons wetsuits and routinely gets slammed by his subjects (unintentionally) as he tries to get as close as possible to the action. His latest project is documented in a stunning video collaboration with SmugMug Films, part of a behind-the-scenes series highlighting photographers at work. Risking his life for the perfect wave . Shot over a two-week period in Norway, the film, called ""Arctic Swell - Surfing the ends of the earth,"" shows Burkard and his surfing companions battling blizzards as they catch freezing Arctic swells. ""You feel like you're really paying the price but the greatest rewards come,"" says Burkard. We asked the photographer why he chases storms and swells and where he loves to shoot most. CNN: How long have you been chasing extreme wave shots? Burkard: I started chasing waves with my surfing and bodyboarding friends as a teenager because I found a certain thrill in being a part of the ocean's energy. I feel that places with extreme waves make for the best stories, which is why I'll continue to chase not just extreme waves but also extreme landscapes in the remote corners of the world. CNN: Do you surf yourself? Burkard: I surfed a bit growing up but it was always more about the ocean for me than about the sport of surfing. The ocean was really my inspiration in the beginning of my photography career and continues to motivate me every day. I try to get in the water daily because it seems to have the ability to constantly rejuvenate and inspire me in all aspects of life. Living near the beach has also provided me the ability to be constantly near great waves and surfers. Central California is an amazing coastline and no matter where I travel, coming home to this stretch of coast gets me excited. CNN: Tell us about shooting this video. Burkard: We traveled to Norway in the spring, when the weather is constantly in flux. Storms shift in out of nowhere and sunny skies can quickly become blizzards. We spent the entire two weeks of the trip in the Lofoten Islands staying in a cabin not far from the beach. When we weren't surfing we were warming ourselves up in hot springs and near bonfires. CNN: What kind of media/audiences have the biggest appetite for your kind of work? Burkard: My portfolio is saturated with tons of surf imagery but I aim to make it appeal to bigger audiences. It's not just for the surfers out there but also the travelers and nature enthusiasts and really anyone who dreams of visiting these places. CNN: Do you have a particularly memorable anecdote from the trip? Burkard: The Arctic and Norway always lend themselves to a ridiculous amount of freezing. When we first arrived on the beach the waves were hardly visible because of the storm -- as we opened our doors the chill of the wind, hail and snow spread up our bodies and it felt like our core temperature dropped 20 degrees in a matter of seconds. I'd told the guys mid-flight that they had to be ready for any type of weather when we landed, but honestly did not expect this strong of a storm to be sweeping through. The session only lasted about 40 minutes as the guys could barely drop into waves with the snow and hail blowing against their faces. They said it was impossible to even open their eyes on some of the waves and were essentially surfing blind. CNN: What are three of your favorite places to photograph? Burkard: Central California. It's been my home for 28 years. I've lived in nearly every city and traveled to as much of the beautiful surroundings that this section of the coastline offers. There's so much variety in this region from camping above the clouds in Big Sur to exploring other worldly dunes near Pismo Beach. I've been to Iceland 13 times and will continue to go back for its unparalleled rawness from the beaches to the mountains. Iceland delivers with hot springs, ice lakes and some of my favorite beaches like Vik and Hofn. The Pacific Northwest offers a diverse landscape with waterfalls, forests, mountains, lakes and a rugged coastline. Oregon summers are close to perfect with temperatures in the mid-80s and sunny skies. Oregon claims they have their own seven wonders with Mt Hood, Columbia River Gorge, the Wallowas, Painted Hills, Crater Lake, the Coast and Smith Rock. I've been to five of them and they are totally worth it. I recommend a road trip. CNN: What's your next big project? Burkard: I'm balancing my work between editorial and commercial projects and looking to line a few trips up for the fall. I'm organizing a few road trips with my sponsors as well as potentially a trip back to the Arctic. I'm also working on a children's book with The Dream Press. CNN: Ever had any mishaps? Burkard: Much of the actual accidents with my surf photography have happened in the water. One of my most memorable experiences was when I went to Kamchatka, Russia. My passport had the wrong date on it and we argued about it for three hours and then the Russia customs security threw me in a jail cell. I was in Vladivostok, a port city on the Sea of Japan. It's like the Wild West out there. I spent 24 hours in a dirty holding cell -- it was basically a really gnarly hotel room with a guard at door. Then I got deported to Korea. When I went back in 2012, it was sort of a redemption but I was scared and a little nervous it would happen again. CNN: How do you get those in-the-water surfing shots? Burkard: It's a challenge to nail that perfect capture of a breaking wave or an action shot. One of the biggest challenges is probably just swimming in the water and often swimming in some precarious situations while trying to get as close as you can to the surfers. There have been many times I have taken water housings to the face or collided with the athlete. Though it's dangerous it's just part of the job. The ability to capture those shots happens through good positioning and being a nimble swimmer. Water shots are tough to get because you're literally dealing in inches. CNN: How often do you travel? Burkard: I travel about six to eight months out of the year and it's the foundation for a lot of my work. I've spent the better part the last 10 years chasing down cold surf in the Arctic and other remote parts of the globe. I operate under the impression that travel should leave marks on you. My style of traveling for surfing in particular is a different approach than most people are used to. I'm drawn to places that are a bit more rugged and I love treating surf trips similar to some might treat travel to the mountains, preparing for every situation and making the extra effort to explore a foreign land. CNN: What kind of photographer do you call yourself? Burkard: I originally thought of myself as a landscape photographer or a surf photographer but I hate to categorize myself in just one category. I find my work definitely incorporates a lot of those elements of adventure, travel and extreme sports.","Extreme surf photographer Chris Burkard chases Arctic swells for work .

"(CNN) -- After a day spent being trailed by a photographer who taunted him, mocked his clothes and hurled insults about his family, actor Jonah Hill had had enough. ""Suck my d***, you f****t,"" he said to the guy, very likely giving the paparazzo exactly what he wanted: a reaction and a profanity-and-slur laced one at that. The entire episode was caught on tape and eventually aired by gossip site TMZ. Hill soon after made the rounds with an apology for using the anti-gay term, telling radio host Howard Stern on Tuesday that he is heartbroken he used such a ""disgusting and hurtful"" term. On ""The Tonight Show,"" he told host Jimmy Fallon that ""the word I chose was grotesque."" But while Hill is left apologizing -- and surely, there is reason for him to do so -- the responsibility was not his alone. After all, the entire episode was a set up, encouraged by a culture obsessed with celebrities and even more obsessed with celebrities behaving badly and a gossip media that rewards those who capture it. The paparazzi have been trained to push buttons, and they've gotten quite good at it. Unlike some stars who, it might be suspected, exhibit bad behavior to court certain attention -- Alec Baldwin could be one -- Hill's response seemed genuinely reactionary, born out of pure emotion and frustration. As such, it is not likely to reflect what he really believes. Hill has been outspoken supporter of gay rights. Last year, he told E! News that ""I have tons of gay friends, gay family members."" Before the Winter Olympics in Russia, he spoke out against Moscow's anti-gay laws. So why, then, was his breaking point reaction a slur? It probably had far less to do with genuine homophobic beliefs than with power and a feeling of loss of it so profound that it inspired a response rooted in the same crude immaturity as that exhibited by his provoker. The photographer, as seen in the video, was antagonistic, his behavior akin to the taunts of a playground bully, and in a way few adults exhibit, or experience, after childhood. And so, in finally responding after refusing to engage, Hill used language the man would understand and words that he, and indeed many, might never say as an adult, especially an adult in 2014. He had a temper tantrum-like reaction, calling on words he might have used at a time he was most inclined to have such outbursts and tantrums, when such words were not OK but you were less aware of what they meant. It's key to remember that celebrities are forced to endure harassment all the time now and bear the burden of the consequences, too. In 2009, Jude Law allegedly hit a female celebrity photographer after her camera flash went off in his face, although he claims it was untrue. Hugh Grant once threw a tub of baked beans at a cameraman. Nicole Richie had restraining orders issued against two photographers who sat outside her house all day, but not until after she doused them with water for trailing her. While celebrities certainly are not perfect, the ones caught on camera, and the ones largely condemned, are inevitably not the ones holding it. To make Hill's comments reflective of how he feels about gays and lesbians unfairly turns the responsibility entirely on him when the real blame is in the culture that rewards those who provoke this behavior and choose to interpret it in the worst way possible. By suggesting these comments indicate that Hill is homophobic, aren't we, in effect, saying that we believe that's what he meant because what else would he mean? In the end, Hill has behaved after his outburst in the most appropriate way possible, expressing believable remorse, explaining the motivations for the attack but also noting there was no excuse for what he said. ""If someone says something that hurt you or angers you, use me as an example of what not to do,"" he told Fallon. ""Don't respond with hatred or anger, because you are just adding more ugliness to the world."" Perhaps the celebrity media would be wise to do the same.","Jonah Hill called photographer a gay slur after being antagonized by him all day .

"(CNN) -- Melanie Griffith and Antonio Banderas are ushering in a new phrase for divorce: the ""thoughtful and consensual"" breakup. After 18 years of marriage, Griffith and Banderas have announced that they're going their separate ways. ""We have thoughtfully and consensually decided to finalize our almost 20-year marriage in a loving and friendly manner honoring and respecting each other, our family and friends and the beautiful time we have spent together,"" the couple said in a joint statement on Friday. Their announcement comes after reports that Griffith, 56, has filed for divorce from her 53-year-old husband. The couple have one child together, 17-year-old Stella. According to People magazine, Griffith is seeking spousal support from Banderas and physical custody of Stella with visitation rights for Banderas. The date of the separation is unknown, and a source tells TMZ the split is amicable. This marriage was the second for Banderas and the fourth for Griffith. She was previously wed once to Steven Bauer and twice to Don Johnson, with whom she had daughter Dakota Johnson, the actress starring in the upcoming ""Fifty Shades of Grey.""

"(CNN) -- Who ordered the anchovies? That's what beach-goers may be asking after a huge swarm of the oily fish descended on the shallow waters of La Jolla Shores, California, this week. ""It is rare to see so many anchovy abutting the surf zone,"" said Professor Dave Checkley of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO). ""More usually, schools are seen hundreds of yards to many miles offshore."" The surf zone is the area in which waves break on shore and humans normally swim. Schools of anchovy can range from hundreds to millions of fish, said Checkley, who gave this school ""a very rough estimate"" of between 1 million and 100 million anchovies. Anchovy influx leads to shark run in . ""In my approximately 30 years at the SIO starting in 1970, I've not seen this before,"" Checkley said. Changing ocean temperatures may be the cause of the anchovy influx. The North Pacific is currently transitioning into a cooler state, which is favorable to anchovies, said Checkley. He added that, while this particular phenomenon is unusual, anchovy populations naturally fluctuate on the scale of decades. Scientists weren't the only one taking note of the army of anchovies. The California sea lion, which preys on the small fish, seemed ""happy as a clam,"" Checkley said. ""Human beach-goers and surfers similarly [were happy], enjoying a rare sight of an abundance of schooling fish within easy swimming distance,"" said Checkley. ""For those able to snorkel among the anchovy, it is a wonderful experience...fish, fish, fish!"" By Wednesday, the school had departed the surf zone near La Jolla Shores. According to Checkley, the anchovies could have moved farther offshore just as easily as they could have slid along the coast to the north or south. 30 mesmerizing underwater photos .

"Munyonyo, Uganda (CNN) -- Arrest warrants issued for Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir for allegations of war crimes and genocide are illegal and should be revoked, according to two British attorneys. The issue of immunity for a sitting president has never been resolved, and can only be dealt with by the International Court of Justice, according to Sir Geoffrey Nice and Rodney Dixon. ""There is a provision in the ICC (International Criminal Court) charter that states should observe their obligations to other states in terms of immunity even where there is an indictment by the ICC,"" Nice told reporters late Saturday at the AU summit, held just outside the Ugandan capital of Kampala. The two attorneys attended the summit as part of their work with non-governmental organizations. The International Court of Justice, based at The Hague, Netherlands, is the principal judicial arm of the United Nations to settle disputes between U.N. member nations, but it has no jurisdiction to try people for war crimes or crimes against humanity. The International Criminal Court, also based at The Hague, is an independent treaty-based organization set up in 2002 by  by countries to decide cases of alleged genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. According to the ICC's website, 111 nations have signed the treaty. The ICC has issued two warrants for al-Bashir's arrest for his alleged role in a five-year campaign of violence in Darfur in western Sudan. The original warrant, the first ever issued by the court against a serving head of state, included five counts of crimes against humanity, including murder, extermination, forcible transfer, torture and rape. It also included two charges of war crimes for intentionally directing attacks against civilians and for pillaging. Earlier this month, the ICC issued a second arrest warrant for al-Bashir, adding three new counts of genocide. The court said the new charges were in addition to the earlier ones. Al-Bashir did not attend the summit, although his case is part of the agenda, and thereby did not risk arrest. The AU earlier this year urged the court to delay war crimes proceedings against al-Bashir, saying a decision to allow the genocide charges harms efforts to bring peace to Darfur. Al-Bashir has traveled to several countries since the warrant was issued, even though any country that is party to the ICC has an obligation to hand him over to the ICC, the court maintains. Leaders from several African countries have said the ICC has been unfair to Africa and have threatened to pull out of the court. According to the Sudan Tribune, Nice and Dixon represent two groups -- the Sudan Workers Trade Unions Federation and the Sudan International Defense Group. The attorneys have filed a motion with the ICC judges asking them to reject the prosecutor's application to issue an arrest warrant for al-Bashir, the newspaper reported Sunday. The London, England-based attorneys urged AU leaders to appeal to the IJC to have the arrest warrants revoked, saying the issue could result in unfavorable consequences for the organization. They questioned whether a serving president could be vulnerable to arrest when attending events such as the summit out of obligation. Nice said the AU should express the same solidarity as when it hosted al-Bashir in its last summit, and also should follow the example of Chad, which hosted him last week. ""The government of Chad took a clear position that their immunity is in place and hosted Bashir,"" Nice said. ""Unless all other states take this clear stand, this situation will remain a legal black hole and can potentially affect the other states."" They said al-Bashir's case was referred to the court by a non-state party, although a case against a sitting president can only be referred by a state party. Some NGOs backed the attorneys, saying Africa is being unfairly targeted. ""We are not against international law, but against the biases of the ICC closing its eyes on atrocities in Gaza, Afghanistan and Iraq, but indicting only African leaders,"" said Mohammed Ansari, who claims to head an association of 42 non-governmental organizations aimed at finding a peaceful solution to the Sudan crisis. ""If African leaders stand together and say 'No,' they would have done a great job since the ICC is focusing only on Africa."" He accused prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo of asking presidents to arrest one of their own, and wondered whether sitting heads of state in Europe would receive the same treatment. Al-Bashir was re-elected president of Sudan this year in controversial but historic elections. He has appeared to thumb his nose at the charges, appearing in public dancing and singing at a rally in Khartoum after the original arrest warrant last year. His information minister has dismissed the ICC as a ""white man's tribunal.""","Al-Bashir's arrest warrants should be revoked, attorneys say .

"Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- Northern Ireland's former first minister and former Democratic Unionist Party leader Ian Paisley has died, his wife, Eileen, said in a statement Friday. He was 88. Paisley, a Protestant preacher, was a key figure in ending three decades of conflict in Northern Ireland, making peace in the end after leading Protestants against compromise with Roman Catholics for years. ""My beloved husband, Ian, entered his eternal rest this morning,"" his wife's statement said. ""Although ours is the grand hope of reunion, naturally as a family we are heartbroken. We loved him and he adored us, and our earthly lives are forever changed."" Paisley made his name as a hard-line pro-British politician during the Northern Ireland conflict and was leader of the Democratic Unionist Party for almost 40 years. During decades of seemingly irreversible conflict between Northern Ireland's Protestant and Roman Catholic communities, Paisley was considered an uncompromising figure. The unrest in the province killed at least 3,600 people and injured 36,000 over the years. To the surprise of many, Paisley agreed to share power with his former sworn enemy, Sinn Fein. Paisley was elected Northern Ireland's first minister in 2007, with former Irish Republican Army commander Martin McGuinness as deputy first minister. Political opponents, but friends . McGuinness said Friday that he had learned of Paisley's death ""with deep regret and sadness"" despite their long political rivalry. ""Over a number of decades we were political opponents and held very different views on many, many issues, but the one thing we were absolutely united on was the principle that our people were better able to govern themselves than any British government. ""I want to pay tribute to and comment on the work he did in the latter days of his political life in building agreement and leading unionism into a new accommodation with republicans and nationalists."" In the brief time they worked together as first and deputy first minister, a close working relationship developed that turned in a friendship, McGuinness said, ""which despite our many differences lasted beyond his term in office."" UK Prime Minister David Cameron described Paisley as ""one of the most forceful and instantly recognizable characters in British politics for nearly half a century,"" adding that he would be greatly missed. ""Of course, Ian Paisley was a controversial figure for large parts of his career. Yet the contribution he made in his later years to political stability in Northern Ireland was huge,"" he said. ""In particular, his decision to take his party into government with Sinn Fein in 2007 required great courage and leadership, for which everyone in these islands should be grateful."" Irish PM: Divisive figure with legacy of peace . Northern Ireland's current First Minister and Democratic Unionist Party leader Peter Robinson also paid tribute to his larger-than-life predecessor. ""Ian Paisley was one of the largest political figures in Northern Ireland and made a massive contribution, particularly to the process in which we are presently engaged,"" he said. ""He had a personality we are hardly ever likely to see again."" The Irish Republic's Prime Minister, or Taoiseach, Enda Kenny said Paisley ""was by any measure a major figure in the history of these islands,"" as he sent his condolences to his family. ""I know that he treasured the peace and friendship that he had lived to see, and helped to build, between our traditions,"" Kenny said. ""His devotion to his faith and to the Unionist people of Northern Ireland was deep and unshakeable. In time, history will come to a fuller judgment of his long career. ""And, while he was of course a divisive figure, his greatest legacy will be one of peace."" People we've lost in 2014 .

"Washington (CNN) -- Herman Cain on Tuesday vehemently denied all sexual harassment allegations against him and said he had no memory of the first accuser to publicly describe claimed misconduct by the Republican presidential hopeful. ""They simply didn't happen. They simply did not happen,"" Cain insisted of the accusations of inappropriate sexual behavior, and at least one incident of alleged sexual groping, when he was head of the National Restaurant Association from 1996 to 1999. But Karen Kraushaar, one of the women who have made allegations, told CNN Tuesday night that Cain is a ""serial denier."" While declining to comment on Cain's Tuesday remarks, Kraushaar said she wanted to meet with the other accusers about their cases. At a news conference he held to respond to the latest accusation, made Monday by Sharon Bialek, a Chicago woman who once worked at the restaurant group, Cain described her as a ""troubled"" woman put up to making false allegations by forces trying to derail his presidential bid. Cain said it could be the ""Democrat machine"" behind the allegations but added that he didn't know for sure. He also said he expected further attempts to smear his name and reputation and vowed that he would not be deterred. ""As far as these accusations causing me to back off and maybe withdraw from this presidential primary race? Ain't going to happen,"" Cain said. In an earlier interview with ABC News, Cain responded ""yes"" when asked whether Bialek was lying when she said at a news conference Monday that Cain made an unwanted sexual advance in 1997. Saying he didn't remember Bialek or the alleged incident, Cain added, ""I have absolutely not acted inappropriately with this woman or anyone else in my entire life."" The latest twist came as more details emerged involving two other former employees at the restaurant association who received payouts and left their jobs, reportedly after accusing Cain of inappropriate behavior. News reports identified one of the woman as Kraushaar, director of communications at a bureau within the Treasury Department who worked at the restaurant association from 1998-99. Kraushaar's lawyer, Joel Bennett, said Tuesday that she complained of ""multiple incidents over multiple days"" in 1999 ""that constituted sexual harassment."" In addition, Bennett challenged Cain's contention that he was unable to remember what Kraushaar had accused him of doing 12 years earlier. The restaurant association said at the time that it investigated the accusations and Cain denied them, Bennett noted. At the news conference, Cain said the only complaint he could recall regarding Kraushaar involved a comment he made that she was about the same height as his wife, as he held his hand up to his chin. He said Kraushaar's complaints had been found to be baseless at the time, and the restaurant association negotiated a severance agreement with her rather than a legal settlement regarding any sexual harassment charges. Kraushaar told CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger that the height remark was not the basis for her complaint. And, Kraushaar told CNN, she received a $46,000 sexual harassment settlement, rather than a severance agreement. Kraushaar said she would like to organize a joint press conference some time in the near future with some of the other women. ""There is safety in numbers,"" she said. ""It is important that it happen in one conference."" Bennett told CNN that Gloria Allred and Bialek have agreed to participate. Cain was introduced at the news conference by Georgia attorney Lin Wood, who said the candidate is having to respond to hearsay, not admissible evidence, in the ""court of public opinion."" ""He comes before you today to defend his reputation,"" said Wood, who represented vindicated Olympic Park bombing suspect Richard Jewell and John and Patsy Ramsey, parents of child murder victim JonBenet Ramsey. ""A reputation that he has built over 40 years of being a good and decent man and a successful business person. I ask you at least afford him fairness."" Meanwhile, a longtime friend of one of Cain's unidentified accusers said Tuesday that Cain mentioned a possible job promotion at the same time he made the accuser uncomfortable with sexual innuendo and overtures. The woman, who spoke on condition of not being identified, said she spoke extensively with her friend about Cain's conduct in 1998 at the time the accuser was allegedly being harassed by Cain while both worked at the restaurant association. According to the woman, the accuser worked in government relations for the restaurant association in 1998 and told her it was well-known that Cain behaved badly. Bialek said earlier Tuesday that a reason she came forward with her account of Cain's alleged misbehavior 14 years after the fact was encouragement from her 13-year-old son. ""He said, 'Mom, I think you need to do the right thing. I think you need to tell on him,' "" Bialek said on CNN's ""American Morning."" ""That confirmed it for me. If my son is saying it, I want to be the role model for him and other kids growing up."" Bialek's story was the first public, detailed account of alleged misbehavior by Cain. She alleged that Cain groped her following a dinner in 1997, shortly after she was laid off by the restaurant association. Cain unexpectedly put his hand on her leg beneath her skirt and reached for her genitals and pushed her head toward his crotch after a dinner at which she sought his help finding a job, she said. Bialek said Cain told her, ""You want a job, right?"" but stopped when she protested. ""I respected him. I looked up to him. And it just was shocking to me that he would use that power in such a way,"" Bialek said. She didn't file a complaint at the time because she no longer worked for the association, said Bialek, who also denied wanting any money for going public, despite a bankruptcy stemming from costs related to her late mother's medical bills. Cain vigorously dismissed the claims in an appearance on ABC's ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" Monday night. ""The feelings that you have when you know that all of this is totally fabricated: You go from anger, then you get disgusted,"" he told Kimmel. ""There's not an ounce of truth in all of these accusations."" In a written statement, campaign spokesman J.D. Gordon said there was ""no record, nor even a complaint filed"" to support Bialek's accusation. Bialek's bombshell came as Cain was in his second week of battling the sexual harassment allegations that have overwhelmed his front-running campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. Cain has come from far back to join former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney atop the polls, and his campaign said it raised $2 million in the week since the sexual harassment accusations first surfaced in an October 30 report by Politico. By comparison, the campaign raised $2.8 million in the three-month quarter from June through October. However, Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said Tuesday that Cain should quit the race if the allegations against him are true. ""It takes incredible courage for an individual to come forward,"" as Bialek has done, Murkowski said. ""So it does cause me to wonder exactly what is out there. I am concerned."" Gloria Allred: A girl's best friend . Bialek's fiance, Mark Harwood, backed her up in an interview with CNN affiliate WGN-TV. ""This isn't for fun. You don't go on a political stage and make these kinds of press conferences unless you really stand by your convictions,"" he said. ""There was no money motive to this. She's got the same political interests as Herman Cain in terms of party, so it wasn't like there was opposing political gain here at all."" In denying all the allegations, Cain said Tuesday that he still has the support of his wife of more than 40 years. ""She knows that's not something I would do,"" he said. Cain, a favorite of tea party conservatives, has risen to the top of the polls after strong performances in several debates and the release of his ""9-9-9"" tax plan, which sets flat 9% rates for corporate and income taxes and creates a 9% national sales tax. He has complained that the sexual harassment allegations amount to a baseless media onslaught against his campaign. Several unaffiliated Republican operatives said Cain must say more about the allegations, because his current message is not putting the controversy to rest. ""He needs to be upfront, forthright and get this story behind him,"" said Bob Vander Plaats, a leading Iowa Republican activist. The ongoing allegations, he adds, are a ""test of Cain's leadership"" and ""a tipping point for his campaign.""

An expected 2,500 potential caucus-goers will be in attendance, and Cain will probably have to address the issue in some form.

"(CNN) -- Last weekend Louis Van Gaal was hailing the beginning of a ""new era"" at Manchester United after a rout of QPR. Sunday saw a sobering reality check for the Dutchman and his expensively-assembled ""galacticos"" as the English Premier League powerhouses surrendered a 3-1 lead to lose 5-3 to newly-promoted Leicester City. It had looked an improbable scenario at the King Power Stadium as United's attacking prowess was on full display with Radamel Falcao setting up Robin van Persie for a headed opener before record signing Angel Di Maria made it 2-0 with a delightful chip. The first danger signs came after Leicester's new talisman Leonardo Ulloa headed home to reduce the deficit, but when another United summer signing Ander Herrera re-opened the two-goal with a clever back heel, the three points were there for the taking. But then in Van Gaal's words ""we made big errors"" and the unheralded home team took full advantage. Referee Mark Clattenburg awarded a contentious penalty after Rafael pulled back Jamie Vardy and David Nugent struck it home. Leicester soon leveled as Dean Hammond was allowed time to pick out Esteban Cambiasso to stab past David De Gea. Juan Mata had come on as a substitute for Di Maria, but he was caught napping by Ritchie De Laet, who found Vardy to put Leicester ahead. A miserable afternoon for United was rounded off when young defender Tyler Blackett hacked down the rampant Vardy and was red carded. Ullo beat De Gea from the spot to complete a remarkable reversal and push Leicester up to seventh in the standings. United, hoping to win Champions League qualification for next season, languishes in 12th. Van Gaal, who was talking of the Premier League title after the 4-0 win over QPR, must have believed it might be a reality after his side's superb opening. ""We started well and score fantastic goals,"" he told BBC Sport. But he acknowledged that the frailties which emerged in the second half were of his team's own making. ""We have too many players who just want to score goals. ""We have to look to ourselves because we made such big errors as a team an personally,"" he admitted. Leicester manager Nigel Pearson was still pinching himself after the victory. ""At the moment it's difficult to believe. ""Today's result and performance will suggest that on the day we can be a difficult opponent."" Later in the afternoon, there was a dramatic end to the early title showdown at the Etihad Stadium between champions Manchester City and current leaders Chelsea. City had 10-men after a red card for Pablo Zabaleta and trailed to an Andre Schurrle goal when former Chelsea star Frank Lampard equalized with virtually his first touch of the ball after coming on as a late replacement. Lampard spent 13 years at Chelsea before joining a new franchise in New York, who then loaned him out to City, and his celebration of the goal was muted. ""I am a little lost for words. I didn't expect to come on and score like that,"" he told the UK's Press Association. ""I came on and the Chelsea fans were singing, and that's emotional. Then I am playing for this club, who have taken me in brilliantly as well, so I am really stuck in the middle here."" Chelsea still tops the standings by three points from Southampton and Aston Villa after five rounds, but its 100% record was surrendered by the late strike. On an afternoon of surprises, West Bromwich Albion moved off the bottom with a 1-0 away win at Tottenham Hotspur, while Crystal Palace stunned Everton 3-2 at Goodison Park. Meanwhile, in the Spanish La Liga, one of Van Gaal's former teams Barcelona maintained its 100% start to the season with a thumping 5-0 win at Levante. It did not quite match the 8-2 drubbing handed out by arch rivals Real Madrid to Deportivo Saturday, but was Barca's fourth straight victory to take a two-point lead over Sevilla. Lionel Messi set up Neymar for the opener, but missed a penalty after being fouled by Loukas Vyntra, who was sent off. Ivan Rakitic, Sandro Ramirez, Pedro and Messi with the fifth completed the scoring.","Leicester City beat Manchester United 5-3 after a remarkable turn around .

"(CNN) -- Colombia are through to the knockout stages of the World Cup after beating Ivory Coast 2-1 at the Estadio Nacional in Brasilia on Thursday. Both sides came into the game off the back of wins in their opening matches -- Colombia put three goals past Greece while Ivory Coast came from behind to beat Japan 2-1. But it was Los Cafeteros who ensured their place in the last 16 following their win and Japan's draw with Greece in the other Group C match. A tense first half ended goalless before the game sprang into life in the 64th minute as James Rodriguez headed home from a corner. Cue Colombia's rhythmic celebrations. Five minutes later they were at it again when Rodriguez turned provider for Juan Quintero after Ivory Coast's defense gave the ball away in their own half. Rodriguez, ever alert, pounced on the mistake before slotting the ball through for Quintero to run onto before firing a low shot past goalkeeper Boubacar Barry. The 21-year-old's first international goal looked to have put Jose Pekerman's men out of sight but Gervinho put Ivory Coast back in the game with a superb individual effort in the 73rd minute. After picking the ball up down the left, the Roma striker skipped past three challenges before unleashing a right foot drive which goalkeeper David Ospina could only parry into the roof of his net. Despite the best efforts of Didier Drogba -- who replaced Wilfried Bony after an hour -- and inspirational midfielder Yaya Toure, the Elephants couldn't find an equalizer. Colombia might have stolen a third late on as Quintero unleashed an audacious 40-yard effort but Barry was alert to the danger. The South American side's first back-to-back wins at the World Cup finals sees them top Group C with a maximum six points with one game to play. Ivory Coast remain in second place with three points. Greece and Japan draw blank . Group C's other game between Japan and Greece at the Estadio das Dunas in Natal ended goalless, ensuring Colombia's progression to the next round. Greece were reduced to 10 men in the 38th minute when their captain Kostas Katsouranis was sent off after receiving a second yellow card. The numerical advantage saw Japan have the majority of possession but Alberto Zaccheroni's side couldn't find a way through a well-organized Greek defense. The result ensures both sides retain a slim chance of qualification as runners up to Colombia who, whatever happens in the final group fixtures, can look forward to their first appearance in the last 16 for 24 years.","Colombia beat Ivory Coast 2-1 in Group C match at Brasilia's Estadio Nacional .

"Sierra Leone (CNN) -- It's Monday, mid-morning as we drive east down rain-slicked roads. There are no cars, no trucks, and no people. Sierra Leone's government demanded a shutdown and its citizens are listening. The West African nation crippled by Ebola is responding to the outbreak through a day of prayer and reflection. But that gives little comfort to us. Ebola is a disease that spreads fear faster than it infects. And the emptiness makes us uneasy. We're headed to Doctors Without Borders or MSF's treatment facility in Kailahun, a border community in the middle of the Kissi triangle, linking the country with Liberia and Guinea. Simply put, it's the epicenter of this unprecedented epidemic. Already more than 1,700 people have been infected across the three countries and now Nigeria and possibly more. Ebola can kill up to 90% of those infected and more than 930 people have already died in this epidemic, dwarfing all previous Ebola outbreaks. The WHO has just declared it a public health emergency. But as we sit down with MSF's emergency coordinator at their makeshift headquarters, we realize, months since the first infection, no one yet truly knows the outbreak's full scope. ""We are too late. In an Ebola outbreak you need to be a step ahead. We are two steps behind,"" says Anja Wolz. What MSF needs, says Wolz, isn't more doctors -- they have those. What's needed are more experts out in the communities, to trace the disease and help train local health workers, she says. Ebola virus: 9 things to know about the killer disease . Wolz, a veteran responder to outbreaks, much of her staff's time is focused educating workers on how to respond safely to a virus that can infect with just one drop of bodily fluid. If mistakes are made, the results are deadly. The MSF's Ebola case management center in Kailahun is tightly sealed. We clumsily balance on one leg and then the other as a technician sprays the soles of our shoes with chlorine. Once inside, orange netting separates the low-risk zone from the high-risk areas. It's just a few feet, but we're told that's more than enough. While Ebola is highly infectious, it isn't particularly contagious, as it's only spread by direct contact with bodily fluids -- not through the air. Still, we watch the doctors take incredible care as they suit-up in layer after layer of protective gear. Dr. Stefan Kruger and others will enter the high-risk zone several times a day. The heat without the suits is uncomfortable. With the suits it's nearly unbearable. The medical staff can only go in an hour at a time, after that the sweat in their facemasks becomes a risk. The work is intense, the stress levels are incredibly high, and there's little doctors can do here except treat the symptoms of Ebola. There is no confirmed cure for the virus. 9 questions about this new Ebola drug . Still Kruger says for him there was no question that he needed to be here. ""At the moment, in Kailahun, if MSF wasn't here, there would be nothing. That's good enough reason for me."" The district's population is nearly 500,000 with just four ambulances. Containing the virus means isolating each patient. For now, that isn't happening -- the center has just 80 beds. ""It is really is frustrating for us because we don't have the capacity to go everywhere,"" says Wolz. Luckily Tenah Naloh came to them. Her husband and son died of the disease and she and her daughter continue to battle in the high-risk zone. To talk to her, we must stand a few feet away, the orange netting, separating us. We know the protocols protect us, but they isolate her. What's the risk of catching Ebola on a plane? When they aren't treating patients, doctors here spend time in the low-risk zone, talking with their masks off, so that patients can see their faces. But, there's no way around the isolation that Tenah and others here feel. Doctors here say they know how to contain Ebola. They just need more resources. It's clear talking to patients like Teneh, the will to beat Ebola is here too. ""We are feeling much better, we are strong and we are going to fight.""","An Ebola outbreak in West Africa has infected more than 1,700 people .

"(CNN) -- Former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic appeared in court Monday to defend himself on charges of war crimes and genocide, resuming a trial which he has fought for years to delay. He spoke firmly and fluently as he defended himself, occasionally looking irritated or dismissive, but not appearing to obstruct the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. The trial was most recently suspended earlier this month to give the defense time to review documents. Karadzic, who is representing himself, faces 11 counts of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. He has denied the charges. The last session of the trial took place Sept. 15. At the time, the defense requested time to study a large set of documents that the prosecution had submitted. The charges against Karadzic stem partly from the killing of more than 7,000 Muslim men and boys in the Bosnian town of Srebrenica in 1995. Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb president at the time, is accused of being responsible for the massacre. Srebrenica became an emblem for the dissolution of Yugoslavia -- once a multi-ethnic state of Serbs, Croats, Muslims and others -- into six countries during a bloody and brutal conflict in the early 1990s.","NEW: The former Bosnian Serb leader did not appear to obstruct the process .

"The Hague, Netherlands (CNN) -- Bosnian Serb genocide suspect Ratko Mladic Monday refused to enter a plea at his war crimes trial, demanding new lawyers and speaking over the judge until he was removed from the court. Mladic, who was captured earlier this year after more than 15 years in hiding, was a combative defendant, repeatedly interrupting the U.N. war crimes tribunal's judge. ""You're not allowing me to breathe,"" the former general said Monday before Judge Alphons Orie ordered him removed from the court and adjourned briefly. Orie then entered not guilty pleas to all counts against Mladic and adjourned the hearing indefinitely. Monday's appearance was Mladic's second at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. At his first appearance on June 3, Mladic dismissed as ""obnoxious"" charges against him. ""I would like to receive what you've read out just now, these obnoxious charges leveled against me,"" Mladic said, after the judge recited the charges against him. ""I want to read this properly, to give it some proper thought together with my lawyers, because I need more than a month for these monstrous words, the ones that I've never heard before."" Mladic was the commander of Bosnian Serb forces during the civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the bloodiest of the conflicts that accompanied Yugoslavia's breakup in the 1990s. The 69-year-old is accused of leading a campaign of ""ethnic cleansing"" against Bosnia's Muslim and Croat populations that included the shelling of Sarajevo and the torture, abuse and rape of civilians. More than 200,000 Muslims and Croats died in the 1992-95 conflict, including nearly 8,000 Muslim men and boys slaughtered at Srebrenica in 1995. It was Europe's worst massacre since World War II. His first court appearance at The Hague occurred days after he was arrested after more than 15 years in hiding. During the appearance, he asked for more time to enter a plea, saying he needs more than the 30 days required so he can  understand the charges. He was ""gravely ill,"" he said, and had not yet read the documents relating to the charges. Mladic was asked whether there was any issue relating to his arrest or detention, or any other issue that he wanted to raise. Mladic -- who repeatedly said he stood up for his country -- said he didn't kill Croats. ""I do not fear any journalist or any people, any nation or ethnicity. I defended my country and people ... now I am defending myself,"" Mladic said. ""If you want the proceedings to proceed as they should ... I just have to say that I want to live to see that I am a free man. And such as I am, I am defending my country and my people and not Ratko Mladic."" Mladic was taken  to The Hague after losing his fight against extradition from Serbia. He was charged with genocide, crimes against humanity and violations of the laws of war. An amended indictment against him was then filed to make sure charges ""reflect the most recent developments in the tribunal's case law."" The suspect gave himself up without a fight May 26. Officials located Mladic in a village north of the Serbian capital after culling information from his former comrades and close family members. It is unclear what source led investigators to the former military commander. The arrest clears a major hurdle that once stood between Serbia and its long-awaited entrance into the European Union, but the move could also usher in a political backlash from the country's electorate, some of whom consider Mladic a hero. Other key fugitive war criminal suspects previously captured are Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, who died in jail in 2006 during his trial at The Hague. CNN's Antonia Mortensen, Dan Rivers, Nic Robertson and Ivan Watson contributed to this report.","NEW: The hearing is adjourned until further notice .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Don Cornelius, the founder of the ""Soul Train"" television show, was found dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to his head Wednesday, authorities said. He was 75. Cornelius died of a gunshot wound at a house on Mulholland Drive, said Los Angeles police Officer Tenesha Dodine. Police responded to the call about 4 a.m. (7 a.m. ET), Dodine said. Cornelius was pronounced dead at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, according to Lt. Larry Dietz of the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office. Los Angeles police investigators reported to the coroner that Cornelius died from a ""self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head,"" coroner's Assistant Chief Ed Winter said. The coroner's office will perform an autopsy to confirm the cause of death. Cornelius created a pilot for ""Soul Train"" using $400 of his own money, according to the website biography.com. The show was named after a promotional event he put together in 1969, the site said. Gladys Knight, who performed on the pilot of the show more than four decades ago, said Cornelius ""opened up so many avenues for African-American artists."" In an interview with CNN Wednesday, Knight said he appeared in ill health when she saw him recently. ""Last time I saw him, he was pretty sick,"" Knight said. ""He had lost a lot of weight, but he still had that thing about him."" Singer Aretha Franklin called his death ""so sad, stunning and downright shocking."" Â . ""Don Cornelius single-handedly brought about a melding and unity of brother and sisterhood among young adults worldwide and globally with the unforgettable creation of 'Soul Train,'"" Franklin said. Singer Smokey Robinson said it was ""a musical tragedy."" ""He brought exposure to black talent and a positive image to young black teenagers that had never been done before with his creation of 'Soul Train,'"" Robinson said. Music producer Quincy Jones expressed shock and deep sadness in a written statement to CNN. ""Don was a visionary pioneer and a giant in our business,"" Jones said. ""Before MTV there was 'Soul Train,' that will be the great legacy of Don Cornelius. His contributions to television, music and our culture as a whole will never be matched."" The Rev. Al Sharpton, who said he appeared on ""Soul Train"" when he was 19 at the urging of his mentor James Brown, remained a friend to Cornelius for 38 years. ""He brought soul music and dance to the world in a way that it had never been shown and he was a cultural game changer on a global level,"" Sharpton said. ""Had it not been for Don Cornelius we would not have ever transcended from the Chitlin circuit to become mainstream cultural trendsetters."" Former Motown Records Chairman Clarence Avant said the music industry ""will forever owe a credit to him."" ""'Soul Train' was the first and only television show to showcase and put a spotlight on black artists at a time when there were few African-Americans on television at all, and that was the great vision of Don,"" Avant said. The program ""is the longest running, first-run, nationally syndicated program in television history,"" according to the website of Soul Train Holdings. ""During its 37-year run, the show featured such staples as the Soul Train line and performers as important and diverse as Al Green, Ike & Tina Turner, Marvin Gaye, The Jackson 5, Stevie Wonder, Elton John, Whitney Houston, David Bowie, Justin Timberlake, Janet Jackson and Beyonce."" In 2008, MadVision Entertainment and Intermedia Partners acquired ""the iconic franchise and catalog of more than 1,100 hours of archival footage from Don Cornelius Productions,"" the site said. Cornelius once told Advertising Age he credited Dick Clark, host of ""American Bandstand,"" for teaching him ""almost all of what I learned about mounting and hosting a dance show,"" according to biography.com. The show, which premiered in August 1970, showed teenagers dancing to the latest soul and R&B music as well as featuring guest performances. Over the years, Cornelius presented many famous performers to ""Soul Train's"" audience, including Knight, Franklin, Smokey Robinson and Lou Rawls, biography.com said. However, the show did not always focus on soul and R&B music, featuring acts including David Bowie, Duran Duran and Robert Palmer, according to the site. ""But when audiences were watching the 'Soul Train' dancers for the next trend in fashion, true trendspotters knew to also watch Don Cornelius,"" according to an article posted on the Soul Train Holdings site. ""... Has he ever looked like anything other than sharp? The answer to that question is no."" ""Before Steve Harvey and his suits, Bobby Jones and Arsenio Hall, Don Cornelius was the original suit man,"" the article said. ""For every outfit (he) deserves a standing ovation because he wore them well."" In September, a 40th anniversary ""Soul Train"" concert was held in Chicago's Millennium Park. Cornelius, a Chicago native, was honored at the event. Cornelius began his career in broadcasting as part of WVON Radio in Chicago, which the Illinois General Assembly described in 2003 as ""the first full-service, black-oriented music station in the city"" as it congratulated the station on its 40th anniversary. It was during his WVON days that he found himself at a show where the Jackson 5 performed in the mid-1960s, according to Time magazine. When a young Michael Jackson opened his mouth to sing, Cornelius recalled being blown away, he told Time after Jackson's death in 2009. ""He's only 4 feet tall, and you're looking at a small person who can do anything he wanted to do onstage -- with his feet or his voice,"" Cornelius said. ""To get to the level of people who can do that, you're talking about James Brown as a performer. You're talking about Aretha Franklin as a singer. Michael was like that as a kid. He did it all, within the framework of one package. Nobody else did that.""","NEW: ""Last time I saw him, he was pretty sick,"" Gladys Knight says .

"(CNN) -- ""The Duke"" knows within a split second if something is awry. The trouble is, he only has two further seconds to put it right. Such are the fine margins in Orlando Duque's chosen discipline, cliff diving -- which he lovingly, and understatedly, refers to as ""fun"" and ""intense."" The Colombian is a master of his art, with 11 world high-diving titles and two Guinness world records to his name, including one for a ""perfect 10"" dive at the World Championships in 2000. He had started out in conventional Olympic-style diving, but after growing tired of the pool he turned to the cliffs and an adrenaline-fueled pursuit that can thrill and terrify in equal measure. ""When I jump off, immediately I know if things are going well or not,"" the 39-year-old told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""I know if I'm having a problem or something or if I just need to go through the dive and things should be OK. ""You get information immediately and it's amazing how fast you start processing that and, if needed, trying to make adjustments -- because you can make adjustments in mid-air, but it is just really quick. ""It's nice. As soon as you jump off, you know if it is OK, we're good."" Duque is a permanent fixture on the Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series circuit, which this year consists of eight events in glamorous destinations such as Brazil, France, Thailand and Portugal. Participants perform four dives from a 27-meter cliff -- two stipulated, two freestyle -- often reaching speeds of 85 kph with every fall. Every leap is a leap into the unknown; a crash landing from 27m is the equivalent of a 13m fall onto concrete. But ask Duque for a comparison and he offers an unlikely one. ""When I dive off a cliff, it's too much fun. I have all the control, I decide to jump and the feeling in the air, it's just amazing,"" he says. ""It's kind of like how your dog feels when he sticks his head out of the window, he's just so happy feeling the wind. That's how we feel. ""When I'm standing up on top, I'm worried. I know this is high. It's going to be some danger involved in the dive but I still want to do it. ""And you're worried, you have a little bit of fear but then when you're in the air, you feel the wind in your face. You hear it. It's really, really intense and then once you're in the water, it's like 'Whoa'. It's just relief. ""In three seconds you went from being really worried and now you're in the water and you're super happy. It just changes really quickly and it's hard to compare to anything else, you know?"" Duque swapped the football pitch for the pool aged just nine and has never looked back. He made the switch to cliff diving in 1995 and was soon the sport's dominant force. His first cliff diving world title came in 2000, the season in which he broke a world record after scoring a perfect 10 from all seven judges for a double back somersault with four twists from 24.4m in Hawaii. He went on to win an incredible nine world titles, the last coming in 2009, the first year of Red Bull's sponsorship. Agonizingly, he lost out to British rival Gary Hunt last year in the very final round of competition. But he did get his own back on an emotional return to the pool in July, winning gold as high diving made its debut at the 2013 FINA World Aquatics Championships in Barcelona, alongside more established disciplines such as swimming, synchro and water polo. It was fitting reward for a pioneer of the sport who has had much to do with its slipstream into the mainstream -- and one which ranks as his proudest achievement. ""It was the first time our sport was there, so being part of that group that was probably the top there,"" he says. ""And winning my first cliff diving world championships back in 2000. It was a great competition. It was of course the first one. That stays in your mind, for sure."" Easing back into the pool environment -- where in Olympic diving competitors leap from heights between 1-10 meters -- is a much easier transition than the move in the other direction. So apart from the obvious, what takes the most adapting to? ""If you're going higher than 25 meters the speed is much higher so you have to get used to that first, and the height and the speed of the fall,"" Duque says. ""You cannot train that too much because the impact of the water is so heavy, the body cannot handle it. You have to really trust yourself, trust your skills. Know that you're going to be able to do it."" Duque can still recall the first time he dipped his toe in the cliff diving water, in Switzerland. ""It was scary,"" he explains. ""And it's because you don't have that much proper training let's say up until that point. You kind of have to take the leap. You go up and then you know you can control certain dives and then you've just got to do it. ""Luckily, I had really good technique, really good preparation. It was in Switzerland in this little river thing and beautiful place but in those moments when you're like scared, you don't even realize what's around you. ""You forget all of that and you just focus on the dive. It was really nice but I can only remember the dive, let's say."" Duque is currently third in the standings with just one event remaining this season -- inclement weather dealt his championship hopes a blow by forcing the abandonment of the penultimate event in Brazil. It did, however, save Duque's body the strain of another competition and he admits that even textbook dives tend to hurt in some way shape or form. ""Doing some of the things I've done, I've scared myself a few times but it's more of a natural thing,"" he says. ""It's just my defense mechanism telling me, 'Listen, be careful', you know? You have to be concentrated to do this. ""I'm fully conscious of what I'm doing and I know I can do it, it's just you have that automatic switch in your head that is telling you be careful, you're not supposed to do this. ""If you make a mistake then deceleration is too quick -- you can have a concussion, you can have a broken coccyx the legs can separate and then you overstretch, separated pelvises -- that's common injury. ""It could be that you have some internal bleeding if you were to land completely flat."" Duque has seen the sport grow in his near 20-year cliff diving career, and after recognition by FINA at the World Championships, there is one more leap for it to make. ""I've been around this for over 15 years and every year is getting better in terms of diving, also the sport is growing,"" he says. ""We've just been included in FINA (which governs most water sports). Hopefully in the future, it will make it to the Olympics. You know, this is a spectacular sport that would add to the Olympics.""","Orlando Duque has won nine cliff diving world championships and two world records .

"(CNN) -- U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, distressed over a call to attack the hotel where Ivory Coast's president-elect and U.N. security forces are based, said Thursday that the forces are ""authorized to use all necessary means to protect its personnel"" and any others at the location. ""Any attack against peacekeepers constitutes a crime under international law, for which the perpetrators and those who instigate them will be held accountable,"" Ban said. A spokesman for Alassane Ouattara, declared the winner in a November 28 runoff election, brushed off the threats to attack the hotel. ""I don't see anyone taking this hotel by any means,"" Patrick Achi told CNN. ""So really I'm not taking (this) seriously."" Tensions have been mounting in the West African nation for more than a month after the disputed presidential election. World leaders have urged self-declared President Laurent Gbagbo to cede power in favor of Alassane Ouattara, who is considered the rightful winner of last month's poll. Read about how the stalemate is rooted in deep divisions . Expressing his concern about ""the deteriorating situation in Cote d'Ivoire,"" Ban said he was ""deeply alarmed"" to learn of the call by supporters of Gbagbo to attack the U.N.-protected Golf Hotel in Abidjan, where Ouattara has his headquarters. Youth and employment minister Charles Ble Goude said on state television RTI Wednesday that supporters should ""liberate this place with your bare hands"" after January 1. In the broadcast, the minister said Ouattara supporters were calling for international intervention in the political standoff. Ban said the U.N. Operation in Ivory Coast has a ""significant number of military and police personnel deployed to provide security for the Government of Cote d'Ivoire and key political stakeholders"" as part of its mandate from Security Council resolution 1962 (2010). ""Any attack on the Golf Hotel could provoke widespread violence that could reignite civil war,"" said Ban, calling on people ""contemplating participation in the attack to refrain from such dangerous irresponsible action."" He urged Ivorians to ""contribute instead to the restoration of lasting stability and democracy in their country."" Meanwhile, the nation's new ambassador to the United Nations warned that the country is ""on the brink of genocide,"" citing the more than 170 deaths that came in the violent aftermath of the election. Youssoufou Bamba, Ouattara's newly appointed ambassador, said Ouattara is concerned about the human rights violations following the elections. ""As you know, there is a massive violation of human rights ... 172 people killed only because they want to demonstrate, they want to speak out, they want to defend the will of the people,"" the ambassador told United Nations officials Wednesday. ""We think it's unacceptable. Thus, one of the messages I try to get across during the conversations I have conducted so far, is to tell we are on the brink of genocide,"" said Bamba, whose credentials were accepted by Ban on Wednesday. Bamba later elaborated on his comments, telling CNN by phone that he is worried about the killing of Ouattara partisans and saying he had heard reports of homes being ""marked"" in areas where they live. The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court defines genocide as the intent to destroy national, ethnic, racial or religious groups, but the targeting of political entities are also included in some generic definitions of the word. Francis Deng, special adviser of the U.N. secretary-general on the prevention of genocide, and Edward Luck, the special adviser of the secretary-general who focuses on the responsibility to protect, said some leaders in the country are stoking violence between different elements of the population for political purposes. ""Given the history of internal conflict in Cote d'Ivoire,"" they warned, ""such actions are highly irresponsible."" They cited unconfirmed reports that Gbagbo and forces under his control are using inflammatory speech to spark hatred. Deng cited ""extremely worrying"" allegations that the Abidjan homes of Gbagbo's political opponents had been marked to identify their ethnicity. Luck cited the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document, in which heads of state promised to protect people in the countries from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. ""This responsibility entails the prevention of these crimes, importantly including their incitement,"" he said. ""We would like to remind all parties in Cote d'Ivoire, as the secretary-general did in his statement of two weeks ago, of this solemn commitment and of the fact that they are accountable for their actions under international law."" The international community -- including the United States, the United Nations, the African Union and the European Union -- recognize Ouattara as the president-elect of Ivory Coast. The endorsement is based on the results of a November runoff election certified by the country's Independent Electoral Commission and international observers. The country's Constitutional Council -- whose members were all appointed by Gbagbo -- invalidated the results, citing reports of voting irregularities in some parts of the country, and declared the incumbent president the winner. Earlier Wednesday, Presidents Yayi Boni of Benin, Ernest Bai Koroma of Sierra Leone and Pedro Pires of Cape Verde met with President Goodluck Jonathan of Nigeria, who chairs the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), a spokesman for the group told CNN. Details of their talks were not immediately available. The three presidents traveled to Ivory Coast earlier this week, but failed to persuade Gbagbo to step down. ECOWAS has threatened military intervention. The political stalemate has led to violence, with scores of people killed in violence in the aftermath of the vote. The U.S. State Department has ordered the departure of family members and nonemergency personnel at the U.S. Embassy in Abidjan. Also Wednesday, a onetime aide to former U.S. President Bill Clinton resigned as Gbagbo's attorney, saying in a letter to Ivory Coast Ambassador Charles Koffee that efforts to arrange a phone call between Gbagbo and U.S. President Barack Obama had been thwarted by unidentified officials in Gbagbo's government. Lanny Davis, who served as special counsel to Clinton, said he had urged Gbagbo to invite ""an independent international investigation of his claims of electoral fraud and violence, and to respect the results of that review, as a path to the peaceful and mediated resolution of this crisis."" The proposed phone call from Obama, which Davis said was being arranged by a senior State Department official, would have presented Gbagbo ""with options for a peaceful resolution, that would avoid further bloodshed and be in the best interests of his country and the people of the Ivory Coast,"" according to the letter by Davis. ""Unfortunately, as you know, the decision was made in Abidjan not to allow President Obama's call to be put through to Mr. Gbagbo, despite my repeated objections to that decision,"" Davis wrote in the letter. ""Nor have I been able to reach Mr. Gbagbo directly myself to offer him this advice, despite repeated requests, as recently as the last twenty-four hours."" Davis' letter said he would continue pushing for a peaceful resolution. Earlier, French Foreign Ministry spokesman Bernard Valero told reporters in Paris that only ambassadors sent with the approval of Ouattara would be recognized by European Union countries. Gbagbo's government has threatened to expel ambassadors of countries that recognize Ouattara's appointees, according to spokesman Ahoua Don Melo. More than 15,000 refugees have fled for neighboring Liberia amid the standoff, according to the U.N. High Commissioner on Refugees.

"Washington (CNN) -- At the outset, this new coalition of the willing seemed like a coalition of the iffy. As Secretary of State John Kerry wrapped up his Middle East tour to rally Arab support for the fight against ISIS earlier this month, he returned with pledges from more than 40 Arab countries, but few concrete commitments. Now, five Arab states -- all Sunni-led -- have joined the U.S. in striking the militant Islamist group inside Syria in a show of force that is bolstering the coalition's credibility. The U.S. confirmed that Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar participated in the action but left it up to those states to divulge the details of their involvement. The coalition that struck Syria for the first time in this conflict was notably, and intentionally, devoid of Western partners to give the efforts an Arab face -- a departure from past American interventions in the region. And while several Gulf nations have supplied the Syrian opposition and Jordan has quietly hosted a CIA training program for Syrian rebels on its soil for at least a year, the strikes mark the most overt and significant involvement in the Syrian conflict. As President Barack Obama and U.S. officials have emphasized: every Arab nation has a stake in thwarting ISIS -- and it appears those countries are catching on to that realization, sending a strong message that ISIS is just as much a threat to Sunnis in the region as to Shiite-dominant Iraq and the Western world. ""The strength of this coalition makes it clear to the world that this is not America's fight alone,"" Obama said. ""Above all, the people and governments of the Middle East are rejecting ISIL and standing up for the peace and security that the people of the region and the world deserve."" The action finally gives credence to State Department officials' claims over the last few weeks that the U.S. has accumulated concrete commitments from Arab nations to thwart the advance of ISIS. ""Last night's strikes were only the beginning,"" Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said. And with U.S. officials predicting a long-term campaign to ""defeat, and ultimately degrade"" ISIS, as Obama has put it, it is still unclear whether Arab nations are committed to a drawn-out effort. How Obama came to launch strikes in Syria . The coalition . The United Arab Emirates, which has been one of the United States' strongest partners in the fight against ISIS, confirmed its participation in the ""international effort against the ISIL,"" another acronym for ISIS. And in its statement, the UAE foreign ministry left the door open to further military strikes, noting that its air force ""launched its first strikes against ISIL."" Bahrain and Jordan also confirmed that their air forces struck terrorist targets inside Syria, with Jordan also saying it would strike again if fighting spills over into Jordan, as it has in recent months. Saudi Arabia's official press agency confirmed the country's role in ""military operations in Syria."" Qatar has yet to put out a statement on its role in the strikes, but a senior U.S. military official has told CNN's Jim Sciutto that Qatar did not drop bombs in Syria. Even if acting only in a support role, its public involvement in the military campaign is a symbolic move that could have big implications. The Gulf nation has been increasingly ostracized by its Gulf neighbors over the last six months for its support of the Muslim Brotherhood and over accusations that it is playing both sides of the Syrian conflict. The U.S. has increasingly pressured Qatar to clamp down on Qataris who are reportedly financing ISIS. U.S.-led airstrikes in Syria: Who's in, who's not . Turkey, Egypt decline aid for anti-ISIS effort . Secretary of State John Kerry continued to emphasize as recently as Friday's U.N. Security Council meeting that ""there is a role for nearly every country in the world to play"" in the fight against ISIS. But some nations were notably off the list of countries involved in the military campaign against ISIS Monday night. Turkey, a NATO ally, and Egypt were both on the sidelines as the U.S.-led coalition pummeled targets inside Syria. While the two countries are part of the 40-member group of nations supporting the take-down of ISIS, the two countries have shied from making any actionable commitments. Until now, Turkey has pinned its restraint on a group of 49 Turkish hostages held by ISIS. And now that Turkey has managed to secure those hostages release, U.S. and NATO officials have raised concerns that Turkey may have bartered its involvement for the hostages' freedom. Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erodgan told reporters in front of the United Nations on Tuesday that Turkey will do what it can to help the fight against ISIS and called the strikes ""positive."" Kerry and Obama have emphasized, though, that the fight against ISIS is not a purely military effort and the Obama administration has been seeking out commitments from Arab states to cut off ISIS's financial pipeline and track the stem and flow of foreign fighters -- now numbered at about 10,000 -- now fighting for ISIS and other extremist groups inside Iraq and Syria. The U.S. has also sought out support from Muslim clerics in the region to denounce ISIS's claim to the mantle of Islam in the region. Growing fear of extremism . And increasing fears in the region have pushed Arab states to join the U.S. effort. ISIS's rise is not an outlier in a region that has seen terrorist and extremist groups burgeon in the aftermath of the Arab spring -- from insurgents in Libya to terrorist groups staking their claim in Egypt's Sinai. So as the U.S. has played up regional fears about the growth of ISIS, partner Arab nations are now calling on the U.S. to help address the swell of extremism in the region, Arab diplomats tell CNN. And further Arab involvement could be contingent on a broader U.S. commitment to stamping out extremist ideology threatening current governments throughout the Middle East. With up to 10,000 foreigners-- most of them coming from the Middle East and North Africa -- fighting with ISIS in Iraq and Syria, Arab rulers are starting to fear how the return of those extremist fighters could threaten their countries' stability. Jordan, for example, which borders both Iraq and Syria, is already feeling the effects of a humanitarian crisis that has spilled onto its territory, where more than 600,000 Syrian refugees are testing the capacity of the Jordanian state. And Arab fears in the region have helped the U.S. drum up a global coalition that can defeat ISIS -- both its forces and its ideology. ""We cannot destroy this group on our own,"" Kerry said in a recent interview with CNN. ""Defeating this common enemy calls for a common cause, and we're taking it on to succeed together.""

"Washington (CNN) -- In a huge, seven-day operation covering all 50 states and four U.S. territories, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials arrested 2,901 convicted criminal immigrants as part of the ""Cross Check"" enforcement operation, ICE officials announced Wednesday. ICE officials trumpeted the arrests at a news conference designed to highlight ""the Obama administration's ongoing commitment to prioritizing the removal of criminal aliens and egregious immigration law violators."" ICE Director John Morton said all those arrested had prior criminal convictions, including 1,282 who had multiple convictions. More than 1,600 of those arrested had felony convictions including manslaughter, attempted murder, kidnapping, armed robbery, drug trafficking, child abuse, sexual crimes against minors and aggravated assault. Forty-two of them were gang members and 151 were convicted sex offenders, officials said. ICE officials acknowledged that despite the large number of arrests, there were still an estimated 1 million convicted criminal aliens in the United States. Morton said one of the issues ICE is trying to deal with is the lack of notification to immigration authorities when offenders are released from jail. Most of the people detained -- 2,642 -- were men. Those arrested came from 115 countries, with immigration fugitives accounting for 681 of those detained in the operation, Morton said. Of the people arrested, 386 were illegal re-entrants. ""The results of this targeted enforcement operation underscore ICE's ongoing commitment and focus on the arrest and removal of convicted criminal aliens and those that game our nation's immigration system,"" Morton in a statement released before the news conference. ""Because of the tireless efforts and teamwork of ICE officers and agents in tracking down at large criminal aliens and fugitives, there are 2,901 fewer criminal aliens in our neighborhoods across the country."" ICE began conducting large-scale operations to target convicted criminal aliens in December 2009 and since then, nine regional and national Cross Check operations -- including last week's -- have resulted in the arrest of more than 7,400 convicted criminal aliens.

"(CNN) -- A Norwegian U.N. official snatched from the streets of Yemen's capital city of Sanaa by armed tribesmen nearly two weeks ago was released unharmed, officials said Friday. U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky said the 34-year-old man arrived in good health at a safe haven in the capital. The victim was part of a team of U.N. election observers scheduled to oversee Yemen's presidential elections in February, officials said. The U.N. official, who was not identified, had been released following negotiations by Yemeni officials, Norwegian Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr Store said in a statement. It was not immediately known what, if any, deal was struck by Yemen with the tribesmen for the official's release. He was kidnapped on January 15 by gunmen demanding the release of a jailed tribal leader, officials said. Interior Ministry officials said previously the kidnapping took place just three miles south of the presidential palace, in one of the busiest and most secure neighborhoods in Yemen. Tribal sources said six men forced the Norwegian into a vehicle and drove him off to Mareb, about 170 km (105 miles) north of Sanaa. The kidnappers were demanding the release of Ali Nasser Hareekdan, whom a local council official in Mareb province said was the prime suspect behind the killing of four Yemeni troops. The soldiers were responsible for securing a business route for oil tankers. Numerous tribal leaders previously told CNN that the Yemeni government was currently negotiating the release of the Norwegian. According to the tribal sources, the Yemeni government sent three negotiators in an effort to have the Norwegian released. Mareb province is well known for tribes who kidnap foreigners and use them as bargaining chips to demand concessions from the governments. The hostages are rarely harmed.","NEW: U.N. says the man arrived in good health at a safe haven in the capital .

"(CNN) -- The kind of insect evidence found by investigators in the trunk of Casey Anthony's car does not prove that a body was stored inside, a bug expert for the defense testified Friday in the Orlando woman's murder trial. Prosecutors used their cross-examination to vigorously challenge forensic entomologist Tim Huntington on his experience, an experiment on a pig and why he omitted a key opinion on a stain photo from his pretrial report. Jurors previously heard from prosecution witnesses who testified that the discovery of one leg of a kind of fly commonly found around decomposing bodies, as well as more numerous examples of a different kind of fly, suggested that a body had been stored in the trunk for no more than three to five days. Prosecutors allege that Anthony killed her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee, and stored her body in the trunk before dumping it in a wooded field in June 2008. Prosecution witnesses have testified about a subtle stain and a strong odor inside the car as evidence that a body had been decomposing inside the trunk. But on Friday, Huntington told jurors that the evidence is not convincing. ""In my opinion, one leg of a blow fly doesn't mean anything,"" said the Concordia University (Nebraska) faculty member. The other insects found in the trunk, phorid flies, are frequently found in household garbage and are not as closely tied to human decomposition, he said. Huntington questioned the relative dearth of flies found in Anthony's trunk, describing experiments he conducted with freshly killed pigs placed in a closed trunk and left to rot. He said the experiment revealed heavy insect infestation and significant staining from fluids leaking from the pig's body, even in weather cooler than that of the Florida summer. Prosecutor Jeff Ashton also asked whether Huntington had experimented with encasing a pig's body in a blanket, two trash bags and a laundry bag, which is how prosecutors claim Caylee's body was disposed. Huntington said he had not tried that. He also said the pig study had nothing to do with the Anthony case. ""I would have handled it very differently"" and replicated circumstances in the Anthony case if he knew he was going to testify, Huntington said. The nation's youngest board-certified forensic entomologist told jurors that from looking at a photo, he did not believe a stain found in the liner of the trunk came from human decomposition. But Ashton got Huntington to admit that he has never previously made such an opinion in a courtroom and was never qualified as an expert on such identification. Huntington told jurors that he did not include his opinion on the stain in his pretrial report because he focused on insects recovered in the trunk. Huntington said it would be almost impossible to clean up decomposition fluids, especially not with paper towels -- a reference to testimony by a prosecution witness that fly-ridden paper towels inside a garbage bag in the trunk appeared to have been smeared with fluid that could have come from a decomposing body. The flies were attracted not to that type of material but rather to spit from chewing tobacco or possibly something inside a salami container found in a trash bag in the trunk, Huntington said. Later, he testified that little or no food was found in the trash. ""It's a bag of trash with trash-feeding insects in it,"" Huntington said. ""There's nothing remarkable about that. ""I think there was never any reason to think there was a body in the trunk."" Huntington said he had no prior experience with cases involving decomposing bodies in trunks. Ashton also questioned what impact the high levels of chloroform detected in the trunk would have on insects, asking whether it could repel or kill them. Huntington said it seemed unlikely but conceded that he had not studied the issue and that he was unaware of any other scientists who had. Outside the courtroom, an ex-convict whom defense attorneys say had telephone conversations with Anthony's father, George Anthony, around the time of Caylee's disappearance held a brief news conference to say he had nothing to do with the case. ""I have no idea who George Anthony is. I've only seen him on TV. I've never talked to him."" said Vasco Thompson, whose surprise appearance on the defense's witness list this week has caused ripples. Anthony's defense attorneys claim that Thompson, a convicted felon who served prison time for kidnapping, is linked to Anthony's father through cell phone records, including four telephone calls made the day before Caylee was reported missing. The defense said it needs to question Thompson ""to determine the existence of relevant admissible evidence in this trial."" Thompson said he doesn't know anything. He said he didn't even have the telephone number until February 2009. ""They dragging me in this for some reason I don't know,"" Thompson told HLN's Nancy Grace. ""It's been totally crazy, ma'am, for the last two or three weeks."" Thompson's attorney, Matt Morgan, said the whole ordeal has been upsetting for his client. ""It's just another attempt by Casey Anthony to try to create some kind of reasonable doubt,"" he told Grace. Prosecutors allege that Anthony, 25, killed Caylee in 2008 by using chloroform on her, putting duct tape over her nose and mouth, or a combination of the two. They allege she then put the little girl's body in black garbage bags and stored it in her trunk before dumping it in woods near her home. Anthony faces seven counts in Caylee's death, including first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse and misleading investigators. If convicted, she could face the death penalty. She has pleaded not guilty, and her defense attorney has said that when all the facts are known, his client's innocence will become clear. The defense has said Caylee was not killed but rather drowned in the family pool June 16. Defense attorney Jose Baez told jurors in his opening statements that Anthony and her father panicked when they discovered the body and covered up her death. George Anthony rejected that scenario in his testimony the first week of the trial. Friday was the second day of the defense case in the trial. On Thursday, Baez questioned FBI examiner Heather Seubert and Orange County, Florida, Sheriff's Office crime scene technician Gerardo Bloise, who said that testing found no blood on any of Anthony's clothes, in her car trunk or in the interior of the car. Seubert also tested three pieces of duct tape found at the scene where Caylee's remains were recovered, two of them covering the mouth portion of her remains. She testified that a DNA profile generated on the outside of the tape matched another FBI forensic examiner, Lorie Gottesman. Testing on the inside of the tape was inconclusive, but a possible indication of DNA there did not appear to match Caylee, Casey Anthony or George Anthony, she said. The trial resumes Saturday morning. In Session's Mayra Cuevas, Ilana Rosenbluth and Michael Christian contributed to this report. Watch Nancy Grace Monday through Sunday starting at 8 p.m. ET on HLN.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The Fair Labor Association released a report Wednesday that Chinese plants of Foxconn, a major supplier of Apple products, have improved worker conditions. The FLA said a June 20 to July 6 audit showed that ""immediate health and safety measures"" have been made, such as enforcement of breaks, changing equipment design to reduce repetitive stress injuries and testing of emergency equipment like eyewashes and sprinklers. In the past two years, the company has been at the center of a storm of complaints about working conditions for its more than 1.2 million employees in China, especially after a spate of worker suicides. In 2010, Foxconn raised workers' pay twice at its factory in Shenzhen after the suicides, Chinese state media reported at the time. Foxconn said it had introduced counselors, started a 24-hour phone counseling service and opened a stress room where workers can take out frustration on mannequins with bats. Inside a Foxconn factory . Last year, an explosion at a Foxconn plant that produces Apple's iPad2 killed four people and injured 18 more. Chinese officials said the blast may have been caused by combustible dust in a polishing workshop. The incident, in the southwestern city of Chengdu, followed a report by rights group Students and Scholars Against Corporate Misbehavior (SACOM) that workers at the same plant do not have adequate training in the use of chemicals and do not have regular on the job health checks. The technology supplier has moved to bring working hours -- including overtime -- down to below 60 hours per week ""with the goal of reaching full compliance with the Chinese legal limit of 40 hours per week, plus an average of 9 hours of overtime per week while protecting worker compensation,"" the FLA said in a news release. Foxconn is part of Taiwan-based Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., one of the world's largest suppliers of components for the electronics industry. Much of its manufacturing division is based in mainland China, where it assembles a range of products including Apple's iPhone and iPad, Amazon's Kindle and Microsoft's Xbox. Apple became the first electronics company to join the FLA in January, and required independent audits of working conditions at Foxconn and other suppliers. A March audit by FLA found violations such as excessive overtime and proscribed 356 actions to improve worker conditions. The July audit found 280 issues had been addressed, with the remaining 76 required to completed by July 2013. Poor conditions reported in June . ""The verification confirmed that Apple and Foxconn are ahead of schedule in improving the conditions under which some of the world's most popular electronics are being made,"" Auret van Heerden, President and CEO of the Fair Labor Association, said in a press release. ""Apple and Foxconn's progress since the March assessment, combined with the additional actions planned through July 2013, would create the roadmap for all Chinese suppliers in the tech industry."" The group also praised Foxconn's efforts to change local legislation in Shenzhen to extend unemployment insurance to all migrant workers in the area, not just those who hold Shenzhen residence permits. ""Our hope is that our efforts will not only benefit Foxconn, but that they will also serve as a model for other companies and help improve working conditions for the manufacturing industry throughout China,"" said Louis Woo, Special Assistant to the CEO, Foxconn Technology Group. ""We are investing in workplace enhancements because our employees are our greatest asset and we are fully committed to continuing to ensure that they have a safe and healthy working environment.""

"(CNN) -- It's been a month since the ""cease-fire"" was due to come into effect in Syria as the first step in a U.N.-backed peace plan, with a team of U.N. monitors on the ground to observe the progress. But clearly, there is no let-up in the violence. Daily reports spill in of bombings, shootings, explosions and more as opposition groups and the regime forces of President Bashar al-Assad battle for more than a year. So, where does the Syria conflict stand now? First, it's very difficult to get a clear picture of the extent of the violence in Syria, who's perpetrating it and where. The international media's access is very limited, and the U.N. observer mission -- still not at full strength -- is unable to monitor all hot spots. But there is certainly no cease-fire; opposition groups report daily attacks by regime forces, which continue to use indiscriminate artillery fire. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says 60 people were killed in the first three days of last week. U.N. peacekeeping chief Herve Ladsous told the Security Council last week that there has been a shift in the military's tactics, according to diplomats, with a decline in the use of heavy weapons and large-scale operations. But there have been widespread arrests recently. The special U.N.-Arab League envoy, Kofi Annan, echoed that view. Diplomats say he expressed concern that arrests and torture were increasing and that government forces ""continue to press against the population."" Observer on Syrians' stories: 'They burned my heart' The Syrian security forces finally broke the back of popular resistance in the Bab Amr district of Homs early in March, but killings continue in the city. There's also been substantial bloodshed in Hama since then, where an uprising in 1982 was savagely put down by the current president's father. In Idlib province in the northwest, the resistance remains strong. Journalists have reported burned-out tanks near the provincial capital, which is ringed by checkpoints. Soldiers don't enter some towns for fear of ambush. Elements of the Free Syrian Army appear to be able to operate in mountainous areas near the Turkish border. Their aim is to turn it into a ""government-free zone."" In the south, where it all started more than a year ago, there are daily reports of security forces opening fire and using artillery against what the regime deems to be opposition neighborhoods. What has really changed in the past few months, starting in Damascus in January, is the emergence of a bombing campaign against key government installations. On Thursday, the deadliest bomb attacks yet killed at least 55 people, according to the Interior Ministry, wounded nearly 400 and caused widespread devastation in the Qazzaz neighborhood of Damascus. A bomb also exploded near a U.N. observer convoy in southern Syria last week. The Syrian Interior Ministry blamed ""terrorist suicide attacks"" for the carnage and says most of the victims are civilians. It does seem that jihadist cells are emerging in Syria. One calls itself the al Nusrah Front and provided video evidence of a suicide attack carried out in Damascus in January. It also claimed responsibility for a bombing in Damascus last week. Some of its claims cannot be substantiated, but U.S. officials have expressed anxiety about a growing jihadist element in the resistance. Most Syrian protesters have little sympathy for Islamist militancy and have begun waving posters insisting there is no al Qaeda in their midst. The opposition Syrian National Council alleges the regime itself is staging such attacks to paint the resistance as terrorists and is itself in league with al Qaeda. Is al-Assad shooting himself in the foot? Of particular concern to the regime is the recent spate of protests and bomb attacks in Aleppo, the commercial heart of Syria, which until recently was spared the worst of the violence. A blast near the Baath Party headquarters Friday was the latest in a string of attacks. If these attacks are the work of the government as the opposition alleges, it would be a high-risk strategy. Bottom line: Although street protests persist, the resistance has become more militarized and is beginning to resemble the early stages of the Iraqi insurgency in 2004. And the security forces continue house-to-house raids and mass arrests, while relying less on the sort of shelling that reduced parts of Homs to rubble.

"(CNN) -- The displacement, injury, and death of civilians in war is always tragic, and the current fighting between Israel and Hamas in Gaza is no exception. But unlike the vast majority of conflicts in history, Operation Protective Edge, as Israel calls it, is one in which images of civilian suffering play a central—and potentially decisive—role in the outcome. And the reason is simple: More than a military strategy, Hamas has a media strategy. Calculatingly, Hamas employs primitive military tactics to mount a sophisticated media campaign that can threaten Israel's basic security. And in conducting that offensive, Hamas can count on one of the world's most powerful weapons: the international media. Hamas fires hundreds of rockets at Israeli cities and towns and tries to attack Israeli farms via the sea and through tunnels. Thanks to Israeli technology and vigilance, few of these actions have inflicted extensive damage. Still, they disrupt Israeli life, impair the economy, and leave cumulative psychological scars. As a sovereign nation, Israel must respond robustly to such attacks. And as a state committed to Jewish and democratic values, Israel provides water, humanitarian aid, and electricity to the residents of Gaza even as their government murders Israelis. Throughout, Israel strives tirelessly to minimize Palestinian civilian casualties. Yet in spite of the hundreds of thousands of leaflets Israel dropped, the countless text messages and personal phone calls it made warning Palestinian civilians to leave targeted areas, tragedies still occur. Israel deeply regrets these losses and continuously hones its operations to make them more surgical still. In a war with Hamas, though, Israel's strength and morality can become vulnerability and guilt. By investing nothing in air raid sirens and bomb shelters, by hiding deep beneath neighborhoods and shooting near hospitals and mosques, Hamas ensures that Israel will invariably wound and kill civilians. Hamas gunmen carry out attacks disguised as women and old men, fight from UN and Red Cross vehicles, store rockets in schools, and physically prevent Palestinian civilians from fleeing combat zones. This context, though, is rarely mentioned by the media when covering the civilian cost of the fighting. Unlike Israel, which respects the privacy and dignity of its fallen, Hamas has no difficulty in displaying these casualties to foreign cameras. And the media broadcasts them, obsessively. The sources of that obsession are many. They include genuine empathy for the Palestinians, objection to Israeli policies, and even animus toward the Jewish state. Still, many journalists would be appalled by the suggestion that they are aiding a terrorist group indistinguishable from ISIS and al-Qaeda. Most, rather, are just doing their job by providing their audiences with the most up-to-date pictures and stories. But whether visceral or professional, the correspondents' motives are, in fact, irrelevant to Hamas. It merely has to know that dozens of Palestinian victims of Israeli fire capture more headlines and airtime than tens of thousands of Syrian victims of Syrians or Iraqi victims of Iraqis. Hamas knows that the construction of a world-leading civil defense system in Israel, and the utter absence of one in Gaza, will ensure a growing gap between Israeli and Palestinian casualties. And that disparity, Hamas knows, will become the focus of media attention and accusations that Israel uses force disproportionally. Above all, Hamas knows that shocking images—some of them taken from the carnage in Syria and Iraq and even from Hollywood horror movies—inflame public opinion. Under mounting pressure, governments will endorse UN condemnations of Israel for war crimes. Hamas missiles cannot destroy Israel, but international sanctions can tie its hands from deflecting them. Unwittingly or not, the international media is complicit in Hamas's plan. While some may think they help the Palestinians by highlighting their plight, in reality, the journalists only worsen it. They effectively absolve Hamas of culpability for using Gaza's population as a human shield, of stealing its aid money to buy munitions and dig fortified tunnels with the sole purpose of killing Israelis, and of contributing nothing to Gaza's welfare. Who's who in Hamas . Israel, by contrast, is expected to apologize for protecting its citizens and for not suffering as many civilian losses as the Palestinians. Rather than depicting a complex reality in which both Israelis and Palestinians are victims of Hamas, the media prefers facile narratives of West versus East, colonialists versus natives, Goliath versus David. Yet the most helpful role that the media plays for Hamas—and the worst disservice for Palestinians—is in demoralizing Israelis. They are willing to pay a high operational price, even to endanger their own soldiers, to avoid hurting Palestinian civilians. Yet, in spite of these unprecedented efforts, the Jewish State is often depicted by the media as indiscriminate and callous. By calling them killers even when they take risks to save lives, the media discourages Israelis from showing restraint in the face of ceaseless Hamas attacks. And Hamas, which wants to drag Israel into a ground war in which even more civilians are killed, welcomes the media's role in convincing Israelis that image-wise they have nothing to lose by escalating. Former President Bill Clinton recently told Indian television that Hamas ""has a strategy designed to force Israel to kill their own [Palestinian] civilians so that the rest of the world will condemn them."" A crucial means through which Hamas accomplishes this is the international media. Just as Israel must relentlessly scrutinize its military actions in Gaza and their consequences, so, too, must journalists take a hard look at the way they cover this conflict. They must not allow themselves to act as accessories to Hamas's murderous strategy that delegitimizes Israel and prolongs the Palestinians' suffering. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Oren.","Michael Oren: More than a military strategy, Hamas has a media strategy .
He says that by exposing its own population to danger, it cultivates sympathy for its cause .
Oren: As any sovereign state, Israel can't tolerate attacks on its territory .
Media effectively absolves Hamas of responsibility for putting its own people at risk ."
"(CNN) -- If you like to put words together in new ways, if you use your imagination when you use language, if you listen to how words sound, or if you have ever worked hard to say how you feel, you might -- by some great definitions -- be making poetry: You might be ready to read some. April -- America's National Poetry Month -- makes as good a time as any to start. That it is spring after a super cold winter only helps. The season summons all the feelings of joy, and sometimes struggle, that change can bring. ""Nothing is so beautiful as spring,"" declared Gerard Manley Hopkins, the Victorian poet and priest. But spring also brought him down: In one of his last poems, he complained, ""Birds build — but not I build,"" he could ""not breed one work that wakes."" For as long as there has been something called poetry, maybe far longer, poets have observed the changing seasons and welcomed new life, celebrating the return of water in dry climates, warmth in cold ones. The author of Psalm 107 thanks the God who can turn ""dry ground into watersprings,"" who can ""sow fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase."" But poetry also comes to us as dissatisfaction. We feel something; we want something; we perceive something that just cannot fit the language of everyday life. It's too strange, or too private, or too intense, so we try to find a way to say this. We need a language whose shapes and symbols, whose sounds and intensities, give voice to our complaint. ""You want something: that's the pretext,"" writes the contemporary poet Rae Armantrout. We turn to poetry when we want something that the rest of life will not let us have. Henry Howard, the 16th century poet who helped invent the sonnet, wrote a poem that his earliest editor labeled ""A Description of Spring, wherein each thing renews, save only the lover,"" bees make honey, snow melts, the turtle doves pair up, ""and yet my sorrow springs."" He has no mate. When T. S. Eliot began his most famous poem ""April is the cruelest month,"" he, too, complained that fertility had left him behind. And spring poets after him would complain in new ways. For the contemporary poet Juliana Spahr, spring in Ohio prompts memories of a creek where ""our hearts took on the brilliant blues, reds and oranges of breeding male rainbow darters and our hearts swam to the female rainbow darter."" But those memories prompt fears about water pollution, climate change, extinction: ""gentle now,"" Spahr tells the endangered American species, ""don't add to heartache."" Ann Kim looks at spring and sees human helplessness: ""who would argue/ a hyacinth/ out of the woods?"" The former U.S. poet laureate Louise Glück finds spring even harder to bear: In her poem ""For Jane Meyers,"" ""the mild harping of the breeze,"" ""the daffodils flocking and honking"" like demented geese, lead her to exclaim ""It is spring! We are going to die!"" And we are going to die. So are the flowers, and so are the rainbow darters, and so are the bees. But poetry can also work to fend off our mortality, bringing together words so powerful, so memorable, that they might preserve something about us for many springs after we are gone. ""Not marble, nor the gilded monuments/ Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme,"" promised Shakespeare. Other poets have been more pessimistic about the same goal: in the poetry of Juan Felipe Herrera, poet laureate of California, ""we pick up stones and scratch our names on sand."" William Butler Yeats sometimes imagined that poetry could leave nature behind, separating the soul from the ""dying animal."" His poem ""Sailing to Byzantium"" asks the masters of an ancient art to ""gather me/ Into the artifice of eternity."" With its rich rhyme scheme, its ""hammered gold and gold enamelling,"" it is a poem fit to memorize. And spring is as good a time as any to find, and memorize, a favorite poem (you might find some here). Today we can find poems, and music and pictures and stories and video records, online with ease (that is one reason slam and performance poetry, meant for the stage, has done so well these days). But in centuries past, when paper could be expensive and pixels were unheard of, the patterns that made poems easy to share and remember were one way to keep any memory alive. When we memorize poetry — as so many of our grandmothers and grandfathers did, whether in English or in Bengali or in Ghanaian Twi — we participate in the power of poetry to keep something alive long after its creators die. To read poetry, to write poetry, to study poetry, in the right spirit, is to make something bloom that can last far longer than any particular flower or leaf. We have libraries — and, now, glowing screens — in which a world of poetry can come to you and you can take it with you, away from school, and out of the house. One of the most important poets in English, William Wordsworth, hoped you would do just that: In a poem entitled ""The Tables Turned,"" Wordsworth asked his ""Friend"" to ""quit your books,"" ""let Nature be your teacher,"" and ""Close up those barren leaves;/ Come forth, and bring with you a heart/ That listens and receives."" More than 200 years later, poetry still encourages you to do just that; you might even bring a poem of your own along.","Stephen Burt: National Poetry Month and onset of spring both great reasons to try poetry .
He says poets have long explored the warring emotion that change of season brings .
He says beauty, life, death collide. ""It is spring! We are going to die,"" wrote Louise Gluck .
Burt: Poems help us express feeling. They are to be read, written, memorized. Try it!"
"Washington (CNN) -- Republican lawmakers want to know why the IRS didn't know that it might have been able to recover missing emails from a former official's computer -- communication at the center of new questions about the agency's targeting of conservative political groups. This latest twist in the saga of Lois Lerner's hard drive was a overly contentious point in a not-surprisingly heated congressional hearing on Wednesday on the protracted, partisan controversy. IRS Commissioner John Koskinen appeared for a third time before lawmakers to testify about the agency's role in the targeting scandal, especially Republican interest in the emails that they say are important to their investigation. Koskinen spent much of his time before the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday answering questions about two years worth of emails from Lerner and a half dozen other IRS officials that were presumed unrecoverable when her hard drive crashed. Analyst claims some information on Lerner's hard drive was retrievable . The exchanges were charged. ""My theory is that you weren't ever going to tell us until we caught you,"" Rep. Jim Jordan said in referencing an ongoing debate over who knew what when. ""When you find any evidence to support that assertion I'd be happy to see it,"" Koskinen said. Top IRS official beats back Republican barrage . Republican investigators have said they've discovered that Lerner's hard drive was merely ""scratched"" and it might have been possible at one point to retrieve information, contradicting Koskinen's previous statements. Last month, he told members of the House Ways and Means Committee that her hard drive had been recycled and the agency wasn't able to get emails that the Republican leadership of the committee want to see. Lerner resigned last year from her post as head of the IRS division charged with looking into groups seeking tax-exempt, non-profit status. Issa: Back-up records of Lerner's emails may exist . Thomas Kane, deputy associate chief counsel at the IRS, told the Oversight Committee last week that there might be backups of some of Lerner's emails. On Monday, the panel released testimony from another IRS employee who did not rule out the possibility that some information from Lerner's computer might be retrievable. Democrats have accused Republicans, especially Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp and Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa, of grandstanding in the midst of a witch hunt. ""Unfortunately you are becoming collateral damage in a fight for the spotlight among two chairmen Rep. Issa and Rep. Camp,"" said Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee. Cummings called the slate of hearings a ""taxpayer funded footrace on who can make the first headlines about Lois Lerner's emails."" What's up with IRS emails? Key questions about the controversy .

"(CNN) -- Rumored for years, the long-awaited smartwatch from Apple may finally become reality in a few months. The Wall Street Journal and Reuters are both reporting that the iWatch, if that is in fact it's name, will be released this fall, likely in October. The Journal says the watch will come in multiple sizes and have 10 sensors for tasks like health and fitness tracking. Reuters says the watch will have a 2.5-inch screen and be ""slightly rectangular."" Both outlets cited unnamed sources familiar with the matter. There's no reason to doubt the reports, really. Apple's top brass have all gone on the record suggesting a new product from Apple will be released by the end of this year. So, with the countdown likely begun, we take a look at five features we'd like to see on Apple's smartwatch. Really be 'smart' The dirty little secret of smartwatches, at least so far? They aren't really smart in the same way that a smartphone is. So far, the offerings from Samsung, Sony, LG and the like have operated as extensions of a smartphone, linking up via Bluetooth or wireless to, for the most part, serve you notifications that you could have seen by pulling your phone out of your pocket. Apple may do something along those lines as well and could still make a successful product. But with their close ties with app developers, we'd love to see Apple make the first smartwatch that lets you leave your phone behind. Wireless charging . If you live in a household where at least a couple of people are competing for socket space to keep their smartphones, tablets, e-readers and the like charged up, things are probably already a tangled mess. Does anybody want one more device to fit in there? Whether it's a wireless charging pad or some new tech whipped up by Apple especially for its smartwatch, we'd love to be able to just set the watch down on the nightstand and have it powered up and ready to go the next morning. And speaking of: . Battery life . Nobody wants a watch that they have to charge up as often as they do their phone. At least for now, these things are nice extras, not essential communication tools, and if they become more trouble than they're worth, the love affair won't last long for even the most dedicated fanboys and fangirls. The smartwatches already on the market average somewhere around two or three days on a charge. The ones that do more, like Samsung's Galaxy Gear, are on the low end of that and those that do less tend to be higher. Apple is surely planning on releasing a feature-rich device. If it can somehow do that while figuring out how to jam a powerful battery into a tiny watch, it will be a nice selling point. Connectivity . Apple's smartwatch is no doubt going to link up with your iPhone, and probably an iPad. But like a lot of other major tech companies, Apple wants to edge its way into a lot of other areas of your life, and it sure would be cool to be able to sync those other products with your watch. Play music on your iPod or iPhone with a tap of the watch. Change channels or pause movies on Apple TV. Beam photos or videos onto your television set via Airplay. All those abilities would be nice. And Apple is believed to be looking into the growing ""Internet of things,"" or connected objects such as cars and refrigerators. This might be a while (and a couple of smartwatch generations) away. But if you could perform home automation tasks like opening your garage, turning off your lights or locking your doors with a watch, we'd be impressed. Of course, it would be cool if the presumed iWatch would link up with non-Apple devices, like those running Google's Android system or Microsoft's Windows. But we're not holding our breath on that. Affordable price . This is Apple. So, there's no reason to think it will depart from a model that's always worked for them. Unfortunately for budget-conscious consumers, that approach is to roll out finely crafted products at premium prices even while devices with similar features can be had without the Apple logo for less. But we hope this one is different. Nobody needs a digital watch and, as mentioned above, there's a decent chance that it won't even work unless you already own another, presumably pricey, Apple device. We'd like to see it priced as an affordable accessory for your iPhone in an effort to pull in customers who want, not need, one. Of course, nobody needed an iPad either. More than 200 million purchases later, it feels like Apple knew what it was doing.","Two reports say Apple smartwatch may be unveiled in October .
Reports say multiple models will be available .
It reportedly will have a 2.5-inch screen and fitness tracking .

"(CNN) -- Both the Syrian government and opposition forces are violating a cease-fire, and the regime continues to deploy heavy weapons in cities, the chief U.N. peacekeeper said Tuesday. But the presence of the tiny but growing U.N. observer team is having a ""dampening effect"" on what has been an atmosphere of ""appalling"" violence, said U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations Herve Ladsous, who spoke as deaths mounted across the country. Regime forces killed at least 46 people Tuesday, including at least 18 people in towns in the northern province of Idlib, said the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a network of opposition activists. Clashes between regime forces and military defectors Tuesday left 12 Syrian soldiers dead, the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The casualties occurred in a military offensive in the Buseira area of the eastern province of Deir Ezzor. The clashes also led to the death of one civilian, the group said. Syria has been engulfed in violence since March 2011, when government forces started cracking down on demonstrators who were peacefully protesting President Bashar al-Assad's regime. The president's family has ruled Syria for 42 years. Some opposition members, including a number of military defectors, have since taken up arms against the regime forces. The United Nations estimates that at least 9,000 people have died in the conflict, while opposition groups put the death toll at more than 11,000. The violence has outraged the world. The U.N. Security Council entered the fray with a peace initiative in recent weeks. It has authorized up to 300 monitors in Syria to monitor a cease-fire and the six-point peace plan of U.N. and Arab League envoy Kofi Annan. Annan's peace plan calls for establishing a cease-fire between al-Assad's government and the opposition, allowing humanitarian groups access to the population, releasing detainees and starting a political dialogue. It also calls for government forces to withdraw from city centers. Ladsous detailed the beginnings of the U.N. monitoring mission and emphasized that ""this is certainly no easy task."" ""All the parties need to take further steps to ensure a cessation of violence in all its forms,"" he said, adding that ""the people of Syria have suffered too much."" Describing violations of the peace agreement, he said observers have seen armored personnel carriers and howitzers in cities. He said Syria has said the armored personnel carriers have been disarmed. ""I think the violations come from both sides,"" he said but wouldn't cite a ratio. At present, Ladsous said, there are 24 unarmed military observers, but he said the monitoring initiative is in its early days. He expects ""this number to increase in the next few weeks."" The observers are now in Homs, Hama, Daraa, Idlib and Damascus. He said there are 150 ""solid commitments"" for the observers, but more are needed. He said Syria has refused visas for three. Communications gear and equipment for personal protection have been provided. But he said the Syrian government has not accepted requests to send air assets and that is still under review. As for freedom of movement, the observers are moving around, but ""more often than not followed by Syrian army and police elements."" ""But that does not prevent them at all from engaging with the local citizens, some that are the opposition, but this is a process,"" he said. The observers ""have had an effective impact on the ground,"" and ""their presence helps to change the political dynamic,"" Ladsous asserted. The fighting has also raised concern from another United Nations official: Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict Radhika Coomaraswamy. She said children have suffered in the conflict, citing reports of two children killed in a mortar attack, a child slain during protests and the body of a girl found in the rubble of a Hama house. ""I urge all parties in Syria to refrain from indiscriminate tactics resulting in the killing and wounding of children,"" Coomaraswamy said in a statement. ""It is the responsibility and humanitarian imperative of all parties to protect and prevent unnecessary suffering of girls and boys."" Another incident points to the apparent violation of the Annan plan, which also calls for ensuring freedom of movement for journalists. Sky News, a British broadcaster, said Syrian officials confiscated a television camera after a crew filmed an impromptu protest in Damascus, the capital, on Tuesday. ""A uniformed officer with a machine gun approached us and violently ripped the camera away from us,"" said Sky News Foreign Affairs Editor Tim Marshall. CNN's Saad Abedine, Salma Abdelaziz, Holly Yan, Yousuf Basil and Joe Sterling contributed to this report.","NEW: Local Coordination Committees says security forces killed 46 on Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- No parent should have to worry about losing his or her child in childbirth or to a mosquito bite, malnutrition or vaccine-preventable diseases such as pneumonia and diarrhea. Yet, in some parts of the world, these are leading killers. In 2010, 7.6 million children younger than 5 died worldwide -- the equivalent of the combined populations of Massachusetts and Rhode Island.The good news is we have the tools to prevent most of these deaths. Vaccines, adequate nutrition, improved health care services and training for workers, anti-malaria bed nets and other high-impact mechanisms can save lives. The challenge is making them widely available and easily accessible in impoverished and underserved communities. In recent decades, the global community has made significant progress in saving children's lives. Since 1990, the mortality rate for children younger than 5 has decreased by 35% worldwide, and more than a dozen countries have reduced their rate by more than 50%. Yet, too many children continue to die, and we have more work to do, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, where child mortality rates are the highest. To achieve the fourth Millennium Development Goal, which calls for reducing the mortality rate of children younger than 5 by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015, we need to accelerate our efforts. Although we have many solutions in hand, we need to strengthen financing, policies, health care systems and service delivery to give more children the chance to survive and thrive. This week, the United Nations Foundation will join governments, the private sector and civil society organizations for a summit in Washington focused on ending preventable child deaths. Experts will identify effective child survival strategies and investments and will serve as the launch pad for activities to assess progress and sustain momentum toward this important goal. One of the promising efforts is mobile technology, which can provide health information directly to families and assist health care workers with clinical decisions and diagnostics. The U.N. Foundation's mHealth Alliance has been leading the working group on mobile health and child survival. It will develop recommendations on how to apply mobile technologies for health. This summit complements the work of the United Nations to dramatically improve the health of women and children around the globe. One program is its ""Every Woman Every Child"" initiative, which aims to save the lives of 16 million women and children by 2015. Nearly two years ago, the U.N. Foundation joined the Every Woman Every Child effort with our own $400 million commitment to maternal, newborn and child health through 2015. We have provided nearly $200 million in grants to U.N. agencies and other partners, launched two new multistakeholder initiatives and engaged more than 300 partners and hundreds of thousands of individual people in efforts to reduce child deaths. Working with our partners, the U.N. Foundation delivers lifesaving vaccines and insecticide-treated bed nets to children, harnesses mobile technologies to improve maternal and child health, provides opportunities for women to voluntarily plan their families, empowers girls to build the future they want and provides clean cooking stoves that are safe and healthy for families and the environment. These efforts are making a difference: In less than a decade, we have sent more than 6 million anti-malaria bed nets to Africa, helped to reduce global polio cases by 99% and helped to decrease measles mortality by 74% worldwide. Through smart, coordinated and committed action, the world could be on the cusp of something truly remarkable -- ending preventable child deaths. This goal is ambitious, but it's one that we can, and must, achieve. Now is the time for all of us -- governments, businesses, civil society and concerned citizens -- to seize this opportunity and fulfill our obligation to give all children an opportunity to celebrate a fifth birthday.

"London (CNN) -- The reason for model Peaches Geldof's death is still not clear, with an autopsy turning up inconclusive results, UK police said Wednesday. Authorities are still waiting for toxicology reports, which could take several weeks, police said. Geldof, the 25-year-old daughter of Irish musician and Live Aid organizer Bob Geldof and TV presenter Paula Yates, was found dead Monday at her home in Wrotham, Kent, southeast of London. Her sudden death prompted shock in the entertainment world and an outpouring of tributes from family, friends and fellow celebrities. According to Kent Police, it is being treated ""as a non-suspicious, unexplained sudden death."" Officers are continuing to investigate the circumstances, the force said. Geldof, who was married with two sons under the age of two, was only 11 years old when her own mother died of a drug overdose. In a poignant column for Mother and Baby magazine, published with the blessing of her family a day after her death, Geldof had written of the huge change her ""two fat little cherubs"" had brought to her life. She had ""lived a life of wanton wanderlust"" as she partied from Los Angeles to London, ""lost in a haze of youth and no responsibilities,"" she wrote. ""But it was becoming boring. I wanted an anchor -- I craved it. And, when I had two wailing, smiling, joyful little blobs of waddling pink flesh, they became my entire existence, and saved me from one of pure apathy."" The transition could be tough, she said, but it was worth it. ""I had the perfect life -- two beautiful babies who loved me more than anything. It was, and is, bliss."" Her widower, rock musician Tom Cohen, said Monday he would bring up their sons, Astala and Phaedra, ""with their mother in their hearts every day."" In a statement, Bob Geldof said his family was ""beyond pain"" and would cherish Peaches' memory forever. A host of celebrities also paid tribute. TV mogul Simon Cowell tweeted his condolences: ""The few times I met Peaches she was a sweet, funny warm person. Much love to her family she has left behind."" CNN presenter Myleene Klass said: ""The news of beautiful Peaches is utterly devastating, God bless her babies. RIP mama xxx."" Geldof was the second daughter of Yates, who rose to fame in the 1980s as presenter of music show ""The Tube."" She died from a heroin overdose in 2000, aged 41. Yates had divorced Boomtown Rats singer Bob Geldof in 1996 after starting a relationship with INXS frontman Michael Hutchence.

"(CNN) -- My great-grandmother used to laugh in moments of misfortune and confusion. It was a reflex honed by the constant daily pressures of being an immigrant in a country where the language and the culture were alien. Years later, she said it was a form of stress release. But thinking back, I can also see how laughter felt like the safest bet when confronted with threatening situations in an unfamiliar world. So, maybe genetics explain my inappropriate hilarity when I heard that the U.S. House killed the Violence Against Women Act this week -- or at least stood by and did nothing while it died. The bill has been almost automatically extended every five years since its initial passage in 1994. This trend came to a sickening halt this week when the Senate sought to extend critical protections to immigrant and Native American women, as well as LGBT people. The current political climate that allows for this betrayal of the fundamental right to safety of body and being feels as alien to me as early 20th-century Texas must have felt to my Polish great-grandma. Drafted in the mid-'90s by then-Sen. Joe Biden, VAWA provided greater authority to investigate and prosecute domestic violence cases. It also beefed up scant funding to support victims. Before VAWA, women saw little incentive and an ominous downside to reporting abuse. More often than not, their abusers saw no punishment, but victims faced losing jobs, homes, marriages and custody of their children. Offer women a safe way out of a terrible situation, however, and the results are impressive. Reports of gender-based violence dropped a remarkable 64% from 1993 to 2010 -- from 2.1 million reported cases to 907,000 reported cases. Even better, the more robust reporting incentives and mechanisms illuminated societal blind spots where abuse still occurs. That led the Senate to pass an expanded version of the reauthorized bill -- one that extends protections to populations that remain vulnerable. The bill was drafted jointly by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, and Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, and passed the Senate by a comfortable margin last Spring. The need is clear: A full third of Native American women will be raped in their lifetimes; an even higher number will experience physical and emotional abuse. Lesbian and gay people will be brutalized at the same rate as general society -- approximately 27% -- but will have far bleaker prospects of finding help. Some 45% of those seeking refuge at a shelter were turned away, and 55% who sought restraining orders against abusers were denied. Undocumented women in the United States risk being held hostage by abusive spouses who lord citizenship over them as a means of control. These same husbands often threaten deportation and separation from children if their wives seek help or report abuse. Opinion: House GOP failed women on Violence Against Women Act . Meanwhile, 80% of migrant workers who work in American agriculture report sexual harassment; many of those include rape. The crisis is so endemic in those industries that the workers often refer to their workplace as ""fil de calzon"" or ""field of panties."" The reforms in the Senate bill that seek to right these devastating and rampant wrongs are modest and simple: Tribal authorities can prosecute offenses on reservations when state and federal prosecutors fail to do so, the government can issue a visa to abuse victims to halt deportation if they agree to testify against their abusers and shelters that receive federal grants are prohibited from discriminating against LGBT abuse victims who seek their services. These reforms seem like no-brainers in the face of so many brutalized women. But not to a House GOP caucus that is scoring political points off the pain of people reviled by the extreme GOP base. It seems that sanctioning an underclass of women who live in fear is a small price to pay for approval ratings at home. Even worse, at least one GOP supporter actually profited from killing the bill. Natasha Spivack is the owner of a mail-order bride company successfully sued by a bride who had been continuously beaten by her husband. She is also a top official on the advocacy group Stop Abusive and Violent Environments, or SAVE, which, according to a report in the Huffington Post, lobbied the ""House of Representatives to include a 'reform to curb VAWA immigration fraud' in its version of the bill."" More protections for these immigrant women would cost Spivack's company a lot of money. These are among the folks with whom the GOP has cast its lot. In the past couple of months, Americans lent their voices to the global chorus of horror as a young Indian woman died from internal injuries after being gang raped, and we shook our collective heads self-righteously when a Pakistani girl was shot by the Taliban simply for wanting an education. Perhaps keeping our eyes on the horizon distracts us from having to face the unchecked bigotry in our own Congress. But the result today is millions of ignored and vulnerable women within our own borders. Aside from the moral repugnance of this, the actions of this minority make our great nation a hypocrite in the eyes of so many around the world who have looked to us to be beacons of democracy and equal rights. And that's not a laughing matter, no matter how alien that makes me feel in my own home country. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ilyse Hogue.","Ilyse Hogue: The House GOP killing VAWA is betrayal of women's right to safety .

"(CNN) -- An Oklahoma City police officer is accused of sexually assaulting several women while on the job, his department said. The case started after one woman came forward and accused Officer Daniel Holtzclaw of ""sexual impropriety"" during a traffic stop, Oklahoma City police Capt. Dexter Nelson told CNN. Holtzclaw, 27, was arrested Thursday and faces nine charges, including three counts of forcible oral sodomy, two counts of indecent exposure, two counts of rape and two counts of sexual battery, according to the Oklahoma County Sheriff's Office. After the first woman's complaint, investigators started looking into all of Holtzclaw's traffic stops for other potential victims, CNN affiliate KOKH said. Nelson said authorities found six other victims. He said some of the women ""were initially less than cooperative, but investigators were able to gain statements,"" he said. Officials said all the alleged attacks took place during traffic stops, CNN affiliate KFOR reported. The city's police chief said there may be more. ""We kind of anticipate there may be more victims out there because this goes back to February -- February was the earliest that we have here, through June,"" Oklahoma City Police Chief Bill Citty told reporters.

"(CNN) -- Kudos to MSNBC's Joe Scarborough for owning up to ""my boneheaded error"" (his words) when last week he claimedâ€”in a slam of President Obamaâ€”that President Reagan cut his vacation short and ""immediately went back to the White House"" after the Soviet Union mistakenly shot down a Korean Air flight in 1983. The facts, of course, are nothing like that, and we will get to that in a moment. Scarborough is not the only Republican figurehead using a rewrite of Reagan history to attack the President, who opted not to cancel fundraising events the day Malaysia Airlilnes Flight 17 was shot down by the Ukrainian rebels. Hosts on Fox News also did some editing to the Reagan narrative. And this past weekend on CNN's State of the Union, House Homeland Security Committee Chair Michael McCaul said Reagan ""rallied the world community"" with his remarks on the 1983 disaster, without mentioning that half a week had gone by before he delivered them. Opinion: Who will speak for the MH17 victims? It is true that, given Putin's involvement with supplying the rebels with weapons and the United States' frosty relationship with Russia, the post-crash optics were not good for President Obama. And Obama supporters may blame all his administration's troubles on Republican obstructionism and some veiled racism, but the White House's inability to get ahead of the message has also contributed to his dismal 42% job approval rating. (P.S. Obama, next time, just visit the border.) But Reagan as a role model? Not if you look at the facts: Not only did President Reagan not rush back to Washington after the Korean Air disaster, but, according to his press secretary, he went horseback riding later that same day. In fact, Reagan had to be coerced by his inner circle to cut short what had already been a 25-day vacation in California. He did not deliver his much talked about speech in which he condemned the Soviet Union for its actions until four days later. The fact is that Scarborough's error is no error at all; it emerged from an airbrushed history that reflects a persistent viewpoint: For many Republicans, President Reagan did no wrong. As a result, Obama's missteps, real or not, are magnified, distorted. It's like comparing an attractive woman to a Photoshopped image of a model. In this case, the model who has been nipped, tucked and repackaged is the Gipper. Consider for example, in 1982, two years after Reagan took office, the unemployment rate soared to 9.7%, the highest since the Great Depression. It was 9.6% in 1983, the year of his 25-day vacation. In January of that year, his approval rating was 35%. In case you were wondering, Obama's lowest was 40%. Considering how often Obama is criticized for his more than 140 rounds of golf, I don't think I need to tell you what would be said about him if he had taken a month off while the country was dealing with the highest unemployment rate in more than 40 years. Or if he was approaching anywhere near the 436 vacation days Reagan tallied in his two terms. In fact, Reagan once joked, ""It's true hard work never killed anyone, but I figure why take the chance?"" I can't imagine President Obama, who Republicans openly call lazy, getting away with that. I don't love President Reagan, but I don't hate him either. Opinion: Putin's big blunder . As with everyone else who has held that office, there are things you can point to that Reagan did exceptionally well and things I'm sure he would have liked to have done over. There were blemishes: Iran-Contra and a HUD scandal in which millions of federal dollars were criminally funneled to big contributors to Republican campaigns, including Reagan's. And Reagan failed to publicly address the AIDS crisis until May 1987, six years after the first cases had appeared. Thousands died on his watch. Reagan never balanced the budget. He raised taxes. In fact, he signed the biggest peacetime tax increase in history. We can debate why and compare his rationale with that of Obama's, but to pretend he didn't do it is ludicrous. We become better by learning from mistakes. But first we must acknowledge they exist, which is why the continual lionization of Reagan does the country a disservice. Rewriting and sugarcoating his history may provide this current brand of Republicans with a feel-good narrative, and regular, ready-made ways to slam the current President, but it doesn't help us learn from the past. This week President Obama is scheduled to sign an executive order prohibiting federal contractors from discriminating against LGBT employees. Some may be surprised, but Reagan himself denounced employment discrimination against gays and lesbians more than 30 years ago while governor of California. This is all part of his legacy as well. Scarborough made a boneheaded error. But the biggest error many Republicans like him make is scrubbing away Reagan's errors just so they can throw mud at Obama. It turns their admiration for the Gipper's ""character"" into worship of a caricature.","LZ: Some in GOP slam Obama over MH17 reaction, say Reagan did better with 1983 Korea crash .

"(CNN) -- A small group of observers resumed the United Nations' mission to monitor a truce in Syria that was tenuous from the start and showed signs Wednesday of unraveling as opposition activists again reported widespread violence. In what appeared to be a pattern of retaliation, security forces were accused of attacking a number of hot spots, including the cities of Hama and Douma, after U.N. monitors had left the areas. Security forces have also reportedly targeted residents who have spoken to the monitors, according to Ahmad Fawzi, spokesman for special envoy Kofi Annan. Fawzi told the U.N. Security Council that people have been harassed and even killed for speaking with the monitors. One activist in Douma urged the monitors to return to the besieged city to see what was unfolding in the wake of their departure. ""The security forces have continued their siege on Douma for the second day today,"" said Mohammed, identified only by his first name for safety reasons. ""We desperately call on the international monitors to return to Douma to see the other face of the regime,"" he said. In remarks to the Security Council on Tuesday, Annan criticized reports of actions forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad. ""I am particularly alarmed by reports that government troops entered Hama (Monday) after observers departed, firing automatic weapons and killing a significant number of people,"" Annan said. ""If confirmed, this is totally unacceptable and reprehensible."" Violence erupted again nationwide Wednesday. At least 100 people were killed, including 70 in Hama, 16 of whom were children, said the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria. The reported violence in the southern city of Hama occurred two days after a visit to the city by U.N. observers. An activist in Hama told CNN that at least 56 people were killed in the shelling of the city's Masha Tayar neighborhood on Wednesday. The activist said that the Syrian military began shelling the neighborhood at noon (5 a.m. ET), causing a number of houses to collapse, killing those inside. The LCC said residents were still pulling bodies from the rubble late in the evening. CNN cannot independently verify reports of violence and deaths within Syria, as the government has restricted access by international media. A handful of U.N. observers have in recent days toured restive cities and towns after Annan, the joint U.N.-Arab League envoy, brokered a six-point peace plan with al-Assad. Annan said Syria's foreign minister told him that heavy weapons and troops had been withdrawn from population centers and that military operations had ended, key elements of the peace plan. Annan described the communication as ""encouraging,"" but added, ""the only promises that count are the promises that are kept."" U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, told CNN that he had little hope for success for the United Nations mission in Syria. ""How atrocious is it that the government allows these monitors in, people have the courage to come out and express their grievances and then they slaughter people,"" he said. ""If it wasn't so serious, it would be a bad joke."" The ongoing carnage, say opposition activists, is proof that al-Assad does not intend to keep his promises. At least 38 people were killed across the country Tuesday, the LCC said. The Red Cross said Mohammed al-Khadraa, a Syrian Arab Red Crescent volunteer, was killed and three others were injured in Douma on Tuesday evening. Al-Khadraa was shot and killed in a vehicle clearly marked with the Red Crescent emblem, the agency said. The U.N. Security Council recently authorized sending up to 300 monitors to Syria for 90 days. They are tasked with observing a cease-fire that was supposed to have begun April 12. By next Monday, 30 observers are expected to be on the ground, with that number swelling to 100 by month's end. But as of Wednesday, only 13 were in Syria. One problem is that Damascus is unwilling to allow monitors from any of the 60-plus nations that are part of the ""Friends of Syria,"" a group that aims to find a solution to the crisis. The group, which includes the United States, France and Britain, met this month and recognized the opposition Syrian National Council as a legitimate representative of the Syrian people. Analysis: U.N. mission does nothing to change endgame in Syria . Nationalities aside, some question whether the observers will be able to get an objective, comprehensive view of the situation. ""They are all the time watched by the security forces of the regime,"" said one opposition activist, who is not being identified for safety reasons. The observers are also tasked with implementing the peace plan, which calls for the government and the opposition to end the bloodshed, provide access to the population for humanitarian groups, release detainees and start a political dialogue. The crisis began in March 2011, when the government started cracking down on peaceful protesters calling for the ouster of al- Assad, whose family has ruled Syria for 42 years. The United Nations estimates at least 9,000 people have since died, while activist groups put the death toll at more than 11,000.

"(CNN) -- Amputees will soon get help from a groundbreaking bionic arm, thanks to the inventor of the Segway and a little inspiration from ""Star Wars."" After almost eight years of research and testing, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved the DEKA arm, a prosthetic controlled by signals from the brain. Unlike most current prostheses, the DEKA can perform such delicate tasks as zipping up a coat, unlocking a door with a key or handling an egg without breaking it. Funded by DARPA, the research branch of the Pentagon, the DEKA project was overseen by Dean Kamen, who invented the Segway personal vehicle. Kamen nicknamed the DEKA arm ""Luke"" after Luke Skywalker, the ""Star Wars"" hero who was fitted for a prosthetic after losing his right hand in a light-saber duel with Darth Vader. The FDA is calling the device the first prosthetic arm that can perform multiple, simultaneous movements via electromyogram electrodes, which detect electrical signals from the contraction of muscles close to where the prosthesis is attached. The battery-powered arm is about the size and weight of a natural limb and has six different grips. A computer in the device can tell what type of movement its wearer wants to make. ""This innovative prosthesis provides a new option for people with certain kinds of arm amputations,"" said Christy Foreman, director of the FDA's Office of Device Evaluation. The DEKA arm ""may allow some people to perform more complex tasks than they can with current prostheses in a way that more closely resembles the natural motion of the arm."" The DEKA bionic arm can be configured for people with limb loss at the shoulder joint, mid upper arm or mid lower arm, the FDA said. It cannot be fitted for someone whose arm was amputated at the elbow or wrist. One of the device's first users was double amputee Chuck Hildreth, who lost both arms in an electrical accident. Hildreth has been demonstrating the DEKA arm on national TV news programs since at least 2009. ""I never thought in my lifetime I'd see something this functional come out,"" he told CNN's Sanjay Gupta in 2010. ""It's definitely going to change my life, and more importantly it's going to change the life of my family. Because ... I'm going to be less dependent on them."" In considering whether to approve the device, the FDA reviewed a Department of Veterans Affairs study involving 36 participants fitted with DEKA arms. The study found that about 90% of participants were able to perform activities they were not able to perform with their current prosthesis, such as using keys and locks, preparing food, feeding themselves and brushing their hair. A video demonstration on DARPA's website shows a man using the bionic arm to transfer eggs from one carton to another without breaking them. The device was developed by DEKA Integrated Solutions in Manchester, New Hampshire. FDA approval means that DEKA can now legally market and sell the bionic arm in the United States.","FDA approves the DEKA arm, a prosthetic controlled by brain signals .

"(CNN) -- A blustery Thursday could mean more than canceled flights and frustrated travelers -- it could result in the grounding of the biggest attractions at the 87th Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York. Winds greater than 23 mph and gusts of 34 mph would keep SpongeBob, Snoopy, Pikachu and the rest of Macy's helium-packed behemoths firmly on the ground. New York officials set guidelines on balloon size and wind speeds after a Cat in the Hat balloon struck a lamp post on Central Park West in 1997, knocking loose a piece and injuring four people, including a woman who spent more than three weeks in a coma. In 2005, an M&M balloon knocked a light pole on two sisters. ""Winds are going to be critical,"" said Chris Vaccaro, a spokesman for the National Weather Service.

But at least one official was optimistic the balloons would be allowed to fly. ""It looks good. It looks very good,"" said New York Police Department Patrol Chief James Hall, who will make the call. The decision on floating the 16 giant balloons will be made early Thursday, according to a statement from Macy's: ""A determination is made on their inclusion based on real-time weather data on parade morning and not forecasts, so it's not helpful to discuss it now."" Others -- from New York's police commissioner to travelers visiting the city for the parade -- were discussing it. ""We came all the way from Puerto Rico to see the parade,"" Jose Ramirez, standing with his sons on the parade route, told CNN. ""It would be a disappointment if we can't see the balloons."" One holiday tradition related to the Thanksgiving Day Parade will go on as planned -- the parade-eve inflating of balloons in the vicinity of the American Museum of Natural History on Manhattan's Upper West Side. ""The balloons aren't about Thanksgiving,"" said Michellian Findley. ""It's about fellowship, family and just being thankful."" Only in New York would each giant parade balloon be assigned a police sergeant as an escort to measure wind speed and conditions. ""We've had several meetings,"" Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said.

"(CNN) -- Northwestern University's president emeritus said that if the players on its football team are successful at forming a union, he could see the prestigious private institution giving up Division I football. Henry Bienen, speaking last week at the annual conference for the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics, said, ""If we got into collective bargaining situations, I would not take for granted that the Northwesterns of the world would continue to play Division I sports."" Bienen, who was president of Northwestern from 1995 to 2009, made his comments during a panel discussion that included a presentation from Ramogi Huma, the president of the National College Players Association and the man who helped organize former Northwestern quarterback Kain Colter to lead a unionization attempt before the National Labor Relations Board. Huma talked, as he has for months, about the issues his organization sees as great flaws in the current NCAA model. The NCPA believes that athletes in the revenue-generating sports of college football and men's basketball are taken advantage of by universities, conferences and the NCAA, making billions from games, while the players sometimes struggle with basic needs like medical care, concussion testing and guaranteed scholarships. Players make argument for union . In March, the NCPA took its fight before the NLRB in Chicago and presented a case during a five-day hearing. Both sides just recently submitted court briefs and a ruling could come by the end of this month, but will likely be appealed by the losing side and could go as far as the U.S. Supreme Court. In short, it could take years before there is a definitive decision. Bienen didn't specifically speak about players being paid, but if the unionization is successful, that would be on the bargaining table, and critics of pay-for-play say they fear that would hurt the academic side of collegiate athletics. Bienen alluded to that when he said a win for the players could lead private institutions with high academic standards -- he specifically cited Duke and Stanford -- to abandon the current model in order to preserve academic integrity. He compared it to the pullback of the Ivy League schools decades ago, when the Ivy League conference decided to opt out of postseason play and to end athletic scholarships, preserving the emphasis on academics for the players. ""In the 1950s, the Ivies had some of the highest-ranked football teams in the country. The Princeton teams were ranked in the top 5 or 10 at that time. They continue periodically to have ranked basketball teams, but they've given up a certain kind of model of sports,"" he said, adding that ""under certain conditions"" the same could happen at other private elite universities that ""continue to play big time sports."" Jerry Price, senior associate athletic director at Princeton, said that change for the Ivy League allowed those schools to maintain academic integrity in the sports where, at other schools, academics can often be compromised in the name of the game. ""It was sort of a breaking point moment,"" Price said, saying the Ivy League schools made the decision not to move forward like the bigger conferences -- to ""draw the line with the commercialization of what football was becoming."" ""And the results have been that Ivy football is not what it was in the first half of the 20th century,"" Price said. ""Certainly not like Big Ten football, SEC football. Its crowds are generally less than 10,000 people. They play only 10 games a year. ... Certainly not what is going on at BCS level."" A Duke spokesman said the university did not have a comment on Bienen's remarks, and a Stanford spokeswoman told CNN that Stanford is monitoring the unionization attempt and, like Northwestern, considers its athletes to be ""students, first and foremost."" While supportive of the freedom of the athletes to file this petition to unionize, Northwestern officials are fighting the petition, which hinges on whether athletes should be considered employees of the university. During his daylong testimony, ex-Northwestern quarterback Colter talked about time requirements that are year-round, at times 50 hours a week devoted to football. ""We are first and foremost an athlete,"" Colter testified. ""Everything we do is scheduled around football. ... It's truly a job."" Colter said he had to give up his pre-med-related major because he couldn't fit the classes into his schedule. The university countered that by bringing in students who were able to stay in rigorous classes, but Colter's sentiment was echoed by the NCAA itself in a 2012 survey that asked athletes what they would change about their college experience. About 15% of men's football, baseball and basketball players said they would have had different majors had they not been athletes. Twelve percent of Division 1 football players said athletics prevented them from majoring in what they wanted. The average time spent on athletics in-season hovered around 40 hours per week for all three sports, according to the survey. That flies in the face of the NCAA 20-hour rule, which states that, no matter the sport, coaches can't take up more than 20 hours of their players time. Right before Bienen spoke at the Knight Commission, Big 12 Commissioner Bob Bowlsby called the 20-hour rule ""a joke"" and said paperwork is constantly falsified. ""I don't know in a particular case what was said to Mr. Colter,"" Bienen said a few minutes later at the Knight Commission, referring to Colter's statement that he couldn't take certain classes. ""I do know that there were many students at Northwestern and at Rice and at Stanford and at Duke who took, and for that matter at Michigan and at Minnesota who took very exacting courses, have had very distinguished academic careers and balanced being athletes and big-time sports with very exacting academic programs."" If they win at the labor relations board, the athletes at Northwestern would get a seat at the bargaining table and could negotiate for a cut of the billion-dollar revenues. But the most compelling argument they've made is for continuing medical coverage for injuries that continue after they leave school. Without it, athletes like former Northwestern player Jeff Yarbrough are stuck with the potential for lifelong and crippling pain. Yarbrough was called one of the fastest teens in Illinois when he was recruited to Northwestern in 2003, but after fracturing both legs on the field, he was left with painful metal rods that are too expensive for him to have removed without help. He's in so much pain, he can barely run, he said. He's only 27 years old. ""I'm like a 45-year-old man. I can't move,"" he said. Colter walked into the labor hearing with a boot on his foot, just a few weeks out of ankle surgery -- an injury from last season. He testified that Northwestern is disputing how much it should pay for his out-of-pocket expenses. Huma argues that all former athletes should be guaranteed full coverage of injuries from their time playing for their schools. It's the one area where Bienen seemed to agree. ""I'm willing to say that there may be extraordinary expenses through injuries on the playing field. I don't know what other universities do, how long paying or helping pay for those injuries are, but I think that's an important point and I think there are obligations that universities have here and I would like to have better information.""

"(CNN) -- ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" takes Henry Cavill's Superman to new places, but one thing remains the same: the hero's iconic suit. On Thursday, Warner Bros. shared the first image of Cavill suited up as Superman, with the ""S"" on his chest firmly in place as he stares through a grim-looking rain. The photo comes just a few days after Cavill was spotted on the set of ""Batman v Superman"" dressed as Superman's alter-ego, Clark Kent. ""The more time I spend with Henry, the more he's Superman to me,"" director Zack Snyder told USA Today of the British actor, who made his debut as the high-flying hero in 2013's ""Man of Steel.""

""We've both created this guy, and we can push him around a little bit,"" Snyder said. But will it be Ben Affleck's Batman doing the pushing? After all, this will be the first time that Batman and Superman are on the big screen together. Snyder wouldn't say, but he did point out that the movie title's spelling is intentional.

"(CNN) -- People sometimes have difficulty understanding why the families of those who die in disasters are so invested in the recovery of their loved ones' bodies. This painful process has been once again brought into sharp relief by the difficulty of retrieving the bodies of those lost in the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 from Ukrainian rebels who control the crash site. The International Committee of the Red Cross notes that international humanitarian law requires combatants to respect the bodies of those who die in conflict, reflecting the importance people attach to the bodies of their loved ones. Throughout history, most cultures have emphasized the management of the bodies of the deceased. Indeed, cultures around the world (and religions are a part of one's culture) still observe different, important, traditions for what happens with human remains, most commonly ranging from burial to various forms of cremation. Grieving families often are eager to perform their traditional rituals for the remains of their loved ones, a process that can bring some level of comfort. But in the early stages of mass casualty disasters, families often share the experience of grief with other families whose loved ones have died, sometimes joining together in a family assistance center to await news of their loved ones and the identification of the remains. After day of tributes, more remains of victims to arrive in Netherlands . It is when the remains of their loved ones are returned to the family that the more personal experience of the death tends to begin. Families will generally leave the family assistance center and return to their homes to grieve with their extended families and friends. While many funerary rituals can be performed without a body, knowing the exact disposition of the loved ones' remains is often a crucial comfort to the family. The death of a loved one can of course be devastating, even if that person is the only one to die in an incident. But disaster mental health professionals know that mass casualty disasters are much more difficult for families than disasters in which only a few people die. It isn't clear why, but the old adage that misery loves company does not seem to apply to mass casualty disasters. As stressful as mass casualty incidents are, however, responders generally know to expect an even more stressful disaster if it is an incident in which body recovery is likely to be very difficult or even impossible. The recent disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is a classic example. Without knowing even the location of the downed aircraft, the recovery of the remains of the passengers and crew becomes more unlikely with each passing day. This is likely to complicate the grieving process for the survivors. Traditional cultural rituals for the dead help us to process grief in a meaningful way. Grief isn't magically resolved through these rituals, but it is one step in the process of building a new life without the presence of the loved one. What happens to the victims' bodies next? The emphasis on the return of the bodies of loved ones to their families is also reflected in the efforts of government officials. Many times rescue and recovery personnel place their own lives at risk as they try to return bodies. Underwater recoveries such as the crash of Flight 800 in 1996, for example, present extreme challenges to the recovery teams. Similarly, in the aftermath of the attacks of September 11, thousands of personnel worked in difficult and dangerous efforts to recover the remains of those who died. Some who worked in these recovery efforts have told me that the work was extremely dangerous, but that it was worth it to help the families as they grieved. Similarly, personnel working in mass casualty morgues have often asked me to tell the families of the deceased how respectfully the remains of their loved ones were treated. Within mainstream American culture, people often seem uncomfortable with the grieving process. Individuals coping with the death of a loved one are often told to ""get over it"" or ""move on."" But even in ideal situations, the grieving process may continue for a year or more in healthy individuals, and periods of grief may continue to occur for years. Some moment may trigger a memory of the loved one who died and lead to a reawakening of the grief. This is not a sign of psychopathology, but of being human. The most helpful process in dealing with grief seems to be talking with family, friends and spiritual leaders. It is also useful to understand that you don't have to be mentally ill to seek support from a mental health professional. This may be particularly useful if family and friends don't seem to understand or appreciate the grief one is experiencing.","Gerard Jacobs: Some don't get why recovery of loved one's body so important to families .

"(CNN) -- With Eric Shinseki's resignation Friday, the top post at the Department of Veterans Affairs goes to interim Secretary Sloan Gibson. Gibson was deputy secretary for just three months before his new role, but President Barack Obama already has laid out some priorities for him. During Friday's news conference in which Obama announced Shinseki's resignation, he also addressed some qualities and priorities needed in the next VA secretary. Pressure had been mounting for Shinseki to step down amid a scandal involving long waits for care at VA hospitals. ""At this stage, what I want is somebody at the VA who is not spending time outside of solving problems for the veterans,"" Obama said. The President said he wants someone who will spend ""every minute of every day"" finding solutions to the problems at the troubled department. Obama ran through a list of problems for the next VA chief to solve: Has the VA reached out to all the veterans who are waiting for care? Have they had appointments scheduled? Is the system being fixed? What new technology is needed? ""That's what I want somebody at the VA focused on,"" he said. ""Not how are they getting second-guessed, and speculation about their futures and so forth."" Document: VA audit report released . Before coming to the VA, Gibson was chief executive at the USO. A West Point graduate, Gibson was an infantry officer in the Army. His grandfather and father served in World War I and World War II, respectively. Gibson also has experience in the private sector, having worked for more than 20 years in banking. Obama said he met with Sloan and ""made it clear that reforms should not wait."" ""They need to proceed immediately,"" Obama said. In his last acts as secretary, Shinseki on Friday announced the firings of those responsible for misconduct, including senior leaders at the Phoenix VA hospital, where some of the most egregious cases of alleged fraud may have occurred. Gibson's immediate priority, the President said, is to ensure that all veterans who call for appointments get them in a timely manner. ""Those are things that don't require rocket science,"" Obama said. ""It requires execution, it requires discipline, it requires focus. Those are things that Sloan (Gibson) has.""

"New York (CNN) -- When it comes to animal exploitation -- follow the money. Using animals for entertainment is big business, plain and simple. The killer whale Tilikum has helped SeaWorld sell millions of dollars worth of tickets. In the process this highly intelligent, social creature has gone through what we can only assume is hell. The hell is called confinement. Veteran whale trainer Dawn Brancheau was killed February 22 when the 12,300-pound killer whale dragged her into a tank at the park and held her underwater long enough to drown her. It happened in front of a crowd, just as she was rubbing the whale after a show. As talking heads debate this avoidable tragedy, few pause to reflect on where it all started. It began in the oceans off Iceland. That's where Tilikum was born. He was born free, free to swim up to 100 miles a day, as killer whales are known to do in the wild. His idyllic life turned into a living hell in 1983. That's when he was captured. Capture of a wild animal is invariably traumatic. He was put in a small pen. After a stint in a Canadian aquarium that ended in tragedy when a trainer was killed by Tilikum and two other whales, the animal was transferred to SeaWorld in Orlando, Florida. Tragedy struck again. First a man who sneaked into SeaWorld was found dead on Tilikum's back. Now, the experienced trainer is dead -- a horrific and violent death. iReport: See photos of moments before the incident . Tilikum has spent more than a quarter of a century swimming in circles, in a space that critics say would be equivalent to keeping a human being in a bathtub. Would you get resentful, angry, maybe even a little rageful and psychotic if you were kept in a bathtub-sized tank forced to swim in circles for more than 25 years? The time has come to free Tilikum. Brazil and Chile are just two countries that have created huge coastal sanctuaries, some running thousands of miles, where whales like Tilikum can return to an active life, one in which they can frolic and explore. This is how nature intended these creatures to live. Zoos and animal amusement attractions use the cover of ""science"" to justify their shows. Getting a whale to splash kids with water is not science. SeaWorld says it supports wildlife conservation, research and education and has rescued thousands of stranded and sick animals. While many of the handlers are undoubtedly well-intentioned and love the animals, the fact is that parks such as SeaWorld are money-making operations. It's about profit. There are many ways to help save the whales. Organizations like Sea Shepherd, Greenpeace, The International Fund for Animal Welfare, the Humane Society and -- yes -- People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals all campaign in various ways to stop the decimation of whales and other intelligent creatures of the sea. SeaWorld needs to stop using Tilikum to breed. He's reportedly sired 17 calves, some of which have not survived. Those that do survive become part of the system of exploitation for profit. Nature did not put whales on this earth to splash kids while stuck in a pen. This is the 21st century. It is time to change.

"(CNN) -- Time to pull up the comfy chair. Monty Python's three-week London engagement ends Sunday, and for the final show the world will be allowed to watch. The last performance from the O2 Arena will be screened in more than 2,000 movie theaters and on TV screens around the world. Well, about 100 countries' worth of the world, anyway. (No word on whether the program will be aired on both peaks of Mount Kilimanjaro.) In the United States, the show can be viewed at selected movie theaters. Reviews for the show, called ""Monty Python Live (Mostly),"" have generally been respectful, if not ecstatic. It's ""a nostalgic celebration of the extraordinary contribution these men have made to modern comedy,"" wrote the Observer's Stephanie Merritt, noting that though the show's greatest-hits pattern isn't thrilling, the rapport between the Pythons -- Eric Idle, John Cleese, Michael Palin, Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones -- is a joy to watch. ""The chemistry between them still fizzes,"" she wrote. The Telegraph was slightly more upbeat. ""The Pythons came, they doddered, but they conquered,"" wrote Dominic Cavendish. The shows haven't been without their flaws. On opening night, Cleese forgot a line during the famous Dead Parrot sketch. But the group -- all of whom are in their 70s -- knew criticism was coming. They made jokes themselves, letting an equally aged Mick Jagger complain about ""wrinkly old men trying to relive their youth"" in a promotional video shown at a Python press conference. ""The best one died years ago,"" Jagger added, referring to Graham Chapman, who died in 1989. Mick Jagger: Python are 'wrinkly old men trying to relive their youth' At the press conference, Palin said that the shows were Python's way of ""saying goodbye publicly"" to fans. Idle added, ""Our motto has been 'leave them wanting less.' "" The performances have done well though. The first show sold out in 43 seconds. One must always look on the bright side of life. If you miss the live Sunday performance, don't worry: The show will air again later in the week. See more comedy content at CNN Comedy.

"(CNN) -- Donald Sterling is digging into his wallet to dig into the NBA and its owners. In his latest salvo against the league that's moved to oust him over racist remarks, the embattled Los Angeles Clippers co-owner has hired ""multiple private investigation firms"" to look into alleged discriminatory conduct by fellow team owners and the NBA itself, said a person familiar with Sterling's legal strategy. He will give each firm a budget of $50,000 and 30 days to finish an investigation, according to this source, who is not authorized to speak publicly and spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity. The billionaire real estate mogul bought the Clippers in 1981 for about $12 million; his estranged wife, Shelly, recently reached an agreement with former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer to sell the franchise for $2 billion. After initially signaling his openness to this deal, Sterling has backed off. Not only won't he sell the franchise -- as league leaders have insisted should happen -- but Sterling insists he won't pay a $2.5 million fine or accept a lifetime ban ordered by NBA Commissioner Adam Silver. Sterling's camp recently filed a lawsuit against the NBA and its efforts to force a sale. Asked whether the latest development -- hiring private eyes to look into the league's business and its 29 other owners -- means that Sterling has decided to take the proverbial gloves off to fight the NBA, the source familiar with his legal strategy said that assessment was not fair. ""I think the NBA took the gloves off,"" said the source, citing the league's actions and its siding in court with Shelly Sterling in her own efforts to finish off the Clippers' sale. A source with knowledge of the NBA's position said Friday that the decision to hire private investigators ""is not uncommon practice by lawyers to drum up allegations and scare tactics to attempt to obfuscate the real issue."" In this case, according to this source, the apparent aim is to cover up ""the conduct of Mr. Sterling that led to his deserved ban and $2.5 million fine."" ""This is not just obfuscation,"" the source added, ""but a strategy of intimidation that will not work and only further demonstrate that Mr. Sterling is unfit to own a team."" Private eyes will probe bias cases, pay for execs . The source said that the private investigators will look into discrimination cases filed by African-Americans and women targeting the NBA. Sterling's camp knows of at least 12 such cases of alleged discrimination dating back to 2008, about half of which involve pregnant women who filed complaints against the league office, said the source. The investigators will also try to dig up instances where league owners made questionable remarks, including anything that would be considered sexist or racist, a source told the Associated Press. The AP described its source as a person familiar with Sterling's legal strategy, though it wasn't immediately clear whether this was the same person who talked to CNN. Sterling came under fire in April, when TMZ posted audio of him talking to his companion V. Stiviano. The release spurred an uproar among league officials, fans and players, who reportedly threatened to boycott playing in the NBA playoffs if Sterling still was in control of the Clippers. That's when Adam Silver stepped in, swiftly banishing Sterling from any team or league activities and promising to work to oust him as an owner. The Clippers co-owner defended his actions -- including a CNN interview that drew more harsh criticism for remarks about basketball legend Magic Johnson -- and went back-and-forth about what to do, before apparently settling on an all-out fight with the league. Sterling voiced particular dismay about the NBA commissioner, who took over that job earlier in 2014 after years in the league office. To that end, the investigators he's hired will look into compensation paid to top NBA executives, past and present, according to CNN's source familiar with Sterling's legal strategy. As to investigating fellow NBA owners, this source said Sterling was reluctant to do so, but felt he needed to at this time. Dispute over Sterling's mental state, family trust . While a large-scale investigation certainly marks an escalation, it can't come as a total surprise. Earlier this week, the 80-year-old Sterling defiantly called the NBA ""a band of hypocrites and bullies"" that needs to examine its own ""discriminatory practices"" rather than try to take away his personal property. This happened days after he sued the NBA for more than $1 billion over its decision to ban him for life and force him to sell the franchise. ""We have to fight for the rights of all Americans. We have to fight these despicable monsters,"" Sterling wrote in a statement, provided to CNN by Bobby Samini, one of his lawyers. Talking to ABC about the Sterling accusation at the halftime of an NBA finals game between the San Antonio Spurs and the Miami Heat, Silver said he had ""no idea what he's talking about."" ""This is about Donald Sterling and his conduct,"" the commissioner said. ""And if he wants to litigate, he'll litigate."" The NBA isn't alone in its fight. It's joined by Shelly Sterling, who has asked a Los Angeles probate court to uphold her negotiated sale of the team despite her husband's objections. The probate court will hold a four-day hearing next month that will focus on whether she has the power to sell the team if her co-owner is incapacitated. The AP source said the probate court decision prompted Sterling to hire the investigators. ""It's unfortunate. Mrs. Sterling regrets having to go to court and publicly air this problem,"" said her attorney, Pierce O'Donnell. ""But Mr. Sterling's conduct in reneging on the sale requires her to do so."" Though the Clippers are owned by a family trust, Shelly Sterling's attorney has said three physicians certified that Donald Sterling lacks the mental capacity to function as a trustee. ""The trust agreement provides that if two qualified physicians certify that he's mentally incapacitated, he's removed,"" O'Donnell said. Though she said three doctors have reviewed evidence and concluded that Donald Sterling is mentally incapacitated, his lawyer has said he is far from incapacitated. Who is Steve Ballmer?

"(CNN) -- Going to travel abroad? Here's a tip: Blend. Don't stick out as a tourist because it's like wearing a ""Mug me!"" sign, travel experts say. The harrowing experience of an Arizona mother ending up in a Mexican border jail has prompted travel experts to renew some do's and don't's for traveling. Every year, more than 2,500 Americans are arrested abroad, with 30% of those cases related to illegal drugs, the U.S. State Department says. The experience of Yanira Maldonado of Arizona -- freed from jail Friday after being accused of drug possession -- seems a case of a person ""being in the wrong place at the wrong time,"" said travel expert Pauline Frommer, publisher of Frommers.com. A Mexican court determined that prosecutors did not provide evidence. Still, the incident calls for globe trotters to be reminded of a few basics, experts say. Do a little homework . The U.S. State Department publishes travel advisories online. So does the U.K. version of that agency, the Foreign & Commonwealth Office. In fact, Frommer likes the U.K. government's travel advisories better because they are time-stamped and more detailed, such as giving the number of pickpockets over what period of time in a country. ""The State Department has very good announcements about what areas are safe and what aren't,"" Frommer said. ""There are certain parts of Mexico that aren't safe: there are border regions you don't want to be a tourist in, and Acapulco -- that's a problem."" Still, many parts of Mexico remain enjoyable destinations for tourism, Frommer said. In fact, she's visited the country three times in the past few years: Cancun, Cozumel and Mexico City. If a U.S. citizen is arrested abroad, he or she is subject to that country's laws and may not enjoy the same protections as provided in the United States. The State Department stands ""ready to assist incarcerated citizens and their families within the limits of our authority in accordance with international law,"" the agency says. If you are detained abroad and there is U.S. consular representation in that country, you have a right to a visit from a U.S. government official, said Alex Puig, regional security director of Americas for International SOS, a medical and security services firm operating in 70 countries. Be the gray man . This is a simple one: blend in. Don't look like a tourist. It may make you an easy mark for muggers or thieves, Puig said. ""Most travelers the last thing they worry about is keeping a low profile,"" Puig said. ""The last thing you really think about is that I should dress in to fit in their local environment. Americans are quite casual in their dress. I land at a foreign airport, and I go into the immigration line and I can easily pick out the Americans by their dress. They like to wear jeans and white tennis shoes and they like to wear college shirts like Georgia Tech. ""You don't want to raise your profile by the way you dress,"" he added. Think as if it's going to be stolen . Don't carry a lot of money. There's no reason to in this age of connectivity. And leave the good jewelry at home. Take credit cards. ""The truth is that in all tourist destinations nowadays there are ATMs aplenty,"" Frommer said. ""You want to rely on your plastic because it can be replaced."" And make sure you have a credit card with a sufficient cash advance in case you need to post bond to get out of jail, said Texas attorney Louis Lopez, who represented a man framed by drug cartels. Be aware of your surroundings . You can bet that Americans traveling in Mexico are now looking under their seat -- especially on buses -- before they sit down, Puig said. That's because the Arizona mother was jailed after the Mexican military allegedly found marijuana under her bus seat. ""Out of this bad situation comes good learning,"" Puig said. ""You can't take anything for granted when you are outside of your normal environment."" The Internet readily offers local news on the country you'll be visiting. The U.S.-Mexico border, for example, is renowned for drug smuggling -- all heading into the United States. The bus carrying Maldonado and her husband was traveling to Arizona from Mexico. ""Just be aware of drugs going from south to north, and drug traffickers are going to use every means available to move their drugs,"" Puig said. ""So you have to be alert.""","Check travel advisories on the State Department website, or UK website .

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Jakarta governor and former furniture salesman Joko ""Jokowi"" Widodo won Indonesia's presidential election, officials said Tuesday, setting him up to be the first person who didn't boast a military or elite background to take the office. His challenger rejected the election hours before the result was announced, citing what he said was massive cheating. It wasn't immediately clear what effect his complaint would have. Widodo won 53% of the July 9 vote, the country's election commission said. His challenger, former military man Prabowo Subianto, a onetime son-in-law to the late Indonesian dictator Suharto, received 47%. The charismatic Widodo styled himself a man of the people, and his background appealed to the country's poor. Before entering politics, Widodo worked in his family's furniture business and started his own export company, which he made a huge success. Comparing the candidates: Prabowo and Widodo . In 2005, he was elected mayor of Surakarta and became known for his spontaneous visits to slums, which drew media attention, and unannounced drop-ins at government offices to catch underperforming workers. He rose to become Jakarta governor in 2012, where he piloted new health care and education programs. In the presidential election, he overcame his critics, who said he was Widodo too inexperienced and hadn't finished his work in Jakarta. Several major projects, including a new railway, remain behind schedule. Subianto withdraws . Before official results were announced, Prabowo on Tuesday declared he was rejecting the election process and withdrawing. In a speech aired live, Prabowo cited ""massive, structural and systematic cheating during the 2014 election,"" and said, ""we will exercise our constitutional right to reject the presidential election and declare it unconstitutional. ""We withdraw ourselves from the process."" When told of Prabowo's announcement, Widodo replied: ""I am sure Prabowo is a statesman who will put the national interest above everything else."" There had been indications that a challenge was likely to be launched from Prabowo, but his allegations are unprecedented, said Douglas Ramage, an analyst from Bower's Asia Group, based in Jakarta. ""This is the first time anyone has questioned the legitimacy of the democratic process itself,"" he said. ""Since 1999, no participant in the process has asserted that the process itself has been illegitimate. ""We're in uncharted territory here."" The election commission said Tuesday that the result would be legally binding if no complaints are filed at the constitutional court within 72 hours. Under Indonesia's election laws, either of the presidential candidates has the right to lodge a legal challenge in the court. Whether Prabowo would do so wasn't immediately clear. Prabowo, the leader of the Great Indonesia Movement (Gerindra) party, had touted his military service and projected the image of a decisive man capable of taking charge. He became part of one of the most influential families when he married Suharto's daughter, Siti Hediyati Hari, in 1983. They have since divorced, but his ex-wife backs his candidacy, even appearing publicly in his campaign events. Hours after the polls closed on voting day, unofficial quick counts, or samples from polling stations, revealed a slight edge for Widodo. Widodo declared victory after seeing results of the unofficial quick vote earlier this month, telling his supporters: ""It's not a victory for the party, not a victory for the team but this is a victory for all Indonesian people."" Jokowi declares victory . Ramage said that the election process has been transparent as results were posted as they've been counted. ""The key thing in the next few hours and the next day will be to see the reaction of the rest of Indonesia's political elite and the heads of the country's democratic institutions"" Over the weekend, Prabowo asked the election commission to delay the results, because of what he and his camp claimed were cheating and manipulation across polling stations. He asked the election commission to stop counting the votes until the alleged cheating cases were resolved. But on Monday, the election commissioner, Arif Budiman, denied Prabowo's request to delay the release of the election results. Nearly two weeks have passed since election day, meaning the paper ballots have been counted. Fadli Zon, one of the leaders of Prabowo's Gerindra party, said they would not accept the results and will fight ""in a non-violent way."" Jokowi eyes Mideast involvement .

"New York (CNN) -- Two American flags that were taken from the Brooklyn Bridge are now in the United States and are expected to be returned to the New York Police Department Friday, a law enforcement official tells CNN. The NYPD said they believe a pair of German artists took the flags and replaced them with two white flags late on July 21, the official added. The white banners were spotted early in the morning on July 22 by construction workers. At the time of the stunt, many New Yorkers wondered whether it represented an act of terrorism or an anti-American statement. But the artists, Matthias Wermke and Mischa Leinkauf, said the replacement of the American flags with two massive white flags last month was nothing more than an ""art project"" by the two performance artists meant to deal with ""questions of historical legacy and art in the public sphere."" The investigation into the incident is ongoing, and it's still unclear what, if any, charges the artists will face, according to the official. The artists dubbed the project ""White American Flags,"" saying that ""like an empty canvas, White American Flags invites many readings, multiple interpretations and projections."" Wermke and Leinkauf also stressed they ""were careful to treat the bridge and the flags with respect and followed the U.S. Flag Code."" ""White American Flags"" was meant in part as a tribute to the German-born American architect of the Brooklyn Bridge, John August Roebling, who left Germany in 1831 ""in search of a better future in the land of freedom and opportunity,"" the artists' statement said. As part of the investigation after the switch, intelligence analysts looked into any possible significance of the day that was chosen to see whether that would yield clues. The date turned out to be the 145th anniversary of Roebling's death. The Brooklyn Bridge opened in 1883 and at that time was the longest suspension bridge, according to the New York City Department of Transportation.","Two U.S. flags taken from Brooklyn Bridge expected to be returned to the NYPD Friday .

"(CNN) -- Slain attorney Chiquita Tate was such a believer in the legal system that she had a tattoo of Lady Justice on her back, college friend T. J. Crawford recalled. Chiquita Tate was in the midde of a high-profile murder trial when she was stabbed to death in her law office. ""She just had an attachment to justice and doing what's right by people. She was always very serious about that,"" said Crawford, a teacher and community organizer in Chicago, Illinois. But Tate, described by colleagues as a tenacious defense attorney who fought for her clients, could not save herself. Family members and friends in Chicago; Atlanta, Georgia, and Tate's adopted home -- tiny Baker, Louisiana -- are reeling from the grisly details of Tate's slaying, and police say it was at the hands of her husband, Greg Harris. They had been married about 14½  months. Harris, 37, is in custody, accused of stabbing Tate to death. He is charged with second-degree murder and the illegal use of a dangerous weapon. A judge last week set his bond at $500,000. In a phone interview with CNN, Harris' attorney, Lewis Unglesby, said police have the wrong man. ""Greg Harris by all accounts ... is innocent. I don't know anybody that thinks he did it, except the police,"" Uglesby said. ""There's nothing in his background. He has cooperated completely with the police; he's signed everything they've asked him to sign. He's let them search his house, his car."" Tate, 34, had started her own law firm in downtown Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and was doing well, family and acquaintances said. ""She was up and coming,"" said Cpl. L'Jean McKneely, a police spokesman in Baton Rouge. Tate was representing a defendant in a high-profile murder trial when, police say, she became a homicide victim herself. Her body was found inside her law office on February 20. Tate was stabbed 38 times, according to a police warrant for Harris' arrest obtained by CNN. While questioning Harris about Tate's death, police discovered an outstanding warrant for him in connection with a battery-domestic violence case. It stemmed from a December 22, 2007, incident at the couple's home. Harris was accused of using ""force and violence"" against Tate, according to Baker City Court records. The court said Harris entered a not guilty plea on March 6, 2008, but did not appear for a May 8 pretrial conference. A warrant was issued for his arrest for contempt of court. When Tate met Harris in late 2007, she fell for him,  head over heels, said East Baton Rouge Parish Juvenile Court Judge Pam Taylor Johnson, Tate's mentor and former boss. ""She came in my office one day: 'I met the most wonderful guy! I need you to perform our marriage -- tomorrow,'"" Johnson recalled Tate gleefully telling her. ""I told her she had to wait three days,"" as required by Louisiana law, Johnson added. Tate did wait a bit. The couple's marriage license is dated January 10, 2008, just two and a half weeks after the domestic violence report from Baker police. They married on February 8, their marriage license shows. Only the couple's immediate family members and two friends attended the ceremony at Green Chapel in Baton Rouge, said Tate's friend Shawn Collins, who was one of those on hand for the wedding. Neighbors in suburban Baker said the couple seemed to settle into a good life in their home on Charry Drive. Baker, population 13,000, was one of the cities that absorbed hundreds of families from the FEMA trailer homes after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The last families housed in Baker moved out last spring. Neighbors recalled seeing Tate frequently driving down the street in her late-model Hummer and Harris steering a Mercedes. Ethan Koobs, who lives across the street from the couple, said Tate was a ""really nice lady, very upper-class, presented herself very well."" Koobs said he didn't see any discontent in the couple's lives. ""They seemed like a pleasant couple, just real nice,"" said neighbor Don Patton, who lives two houses down. ""They kept their house and their lawn very nice."" He recalled the couple's concern for their neighbors after Hurricane Gustav, which raked south Louisiana on September 1, 2008, before petering out in southeast Texas. It knocked out power to 1.5 million homes in southern Louisiana, and thousands of homes were damaged by the wind. Harris, a carpenter, found his skills useful. ""[Harris] was just generally concerned about everybody's well-being,"" Patton said. ""We'd huddle in the street and he'd ask if anybody needed anything."" The couple helped their neighbors rebuild. But the warrant for Harris' arrest in the murder case revealed a fracture in the marriage. Tate was ""planning on divorcing the defendant due to marital problems"" and had leased her own apartment, the warrant stated. As far as their friends were concerned, there was no trouble in the marriage and Tate appeared to be a doting wife. She also enjoyed battling it out on behalf of her clients in the courtroom. Tate, who was raised with six siblings, was tenacious even as a youngster, recalled childhood friend Ursula Bryant-Hill. ""She was always strong-willed and she analyzed everything. Everybody told her 'You'd be a good lawyer,'"" said Bryant-Hill, of Hueytown, Alabama. ""If you knew Chiquita when she was growing up in Baton Rouge, she was always cautious about who she let in her intimate setting. 'Watch your surroundings,' that's how she was,"" Bryant-Hill added. Upon graduation from college, Tate worked briefly as a legislative secretary, recording minutes at Atlanta City Council meetings. But she longed to return home to Louisiana to attend law school at Southern University. ""When she told me she was in law school, I screamed,"" Bryant-Hill said. Her friend, Juvenile Court Judge Johnson, said Tate lived by one creed: Justice for all, especially for those more vulnerable in society. ""I couldn't get her to accept the fact that 'things happen.' I told her some things you can't change [about the system], but it is our duty to see if we can equalize things,"" Johnson said. Tate is remembered as someone who fought tirelessly for what she believed in. Now her loved ones hope the legal system will work for her. The days have been long for Tate's family. Asked how she has been coping, Denita Tate, the victim's sister, said, ""I'm not. It's harder every day."" ""We want closure with our family and with our sister, and we want justice,"" Denita Tate said.","Chiquita Tate found killed in her Louisiana law office on February 20 .

"(CNN) -- Police say the motorcyclist raced through traffic at reckless speeds in San Antonio, Texas, then posted a video to Facebook last week titled ""Catch Me If You Can."" It turns out, they could. Investigators searching for a stolen motorcycle found the man they suspect of being the reckless rider -- Alberto Rodriguez, 27 -- when he ran out the back door of the house, San Antonio Police Sgt.

"(CNN) -- Part of a picturesque toll highway that tourists use to travel between the Mexican towns of Ensenada and Tijuana collapsed this weekend, civil protection officials in Mexico said. One of the holes created by the landslide was more than 40 feet deep and stretched 200 feet long. A cement truck was stuck when the ground started shifting, but the driver made it out safely, officials told CNNMexico. The truck ended up tumbling into the Pacific Ocean, which is just west of the road. Officials say it may take as long as a year to repair the damage. Building a temporary road is one option being considered, authorities said. For now, motorists will use a nearby free road. It is unclear what caused the landslide. According to the United States Geological Survey, a magnitude-4.6 earthquake centered about 60 miles southeast of Ensenada struck on December 19, but the events might not be connected. On the Facebook page of the Baja California Civil Protection services, officials said the road is not in an area where there is a fault line.

You have two options: You can stare at her awkwardly or pretend you're Kelly Keagy and lend your vocals to the chorus. It's scenes like this one, which opens Adam Shankman's new film ""Rock of Ages,"" based on the rock opera of the same name, that have audiences split on movie musicals. Formerly a surefire moneymaker, the genre has become more accustomed to sporadic success in recent years. Still, studios recreate such musicals, hoping for ""Mamma Mia's"" box office numbers and ""Chicago's"" critical acclaim. Boasting names like Tom Cruise and Catherine Zeta-Jones, nostalgic rock anthems and '80s flair, ""Rock of Ages"" will prevail if audiences are in on the joke, said Robert Viagas, the founding editor of Playbill.com. Director Shankman appears to agree with Viagas. ""The period sort of makes fun of itself in its own way because it was a really wonky sort of boundaryless time,"" Shankman, who directed, produced and choreographed the film, told The Hollywood Reporter. ""I wanted to make sure the comedy and emotion were coming from the characters and not from their wigs or costumes, that they weren't always chasing the joke of the era."" Big hair and fanny packs aside, musicals have a hard enough time appealing to mainstream audiences. ""At a certain point, people lost the ability to ... imagine a realistic story being told through music and dance,"" Viagas said, noting theatrical underachievers like 1967's ""Doctor Dolittle,"" 1968's ""Star!"" and 1969's ""Hello, Dolly!"" ""Movies have become so literal,"" he added. Some people respond better to ""things that are sort of in quotes. It has to have an element of reality."" Despite Shankman's success with 2007's ""Hairspray,"" which grossed more than $118 million domestically, he said: ""I really worry about losing money for people and hurting people's careers, and ('Rock of Ages') was a really big gamble."" But the director said he was comforted by Cruise's enthusiasm and hard work as rock star Stacee Jaxx. Cruise has said he spent about five hours a day training for the role, and it's a good thing, because Jeffrey Simonoff, a New York University Stern professor of statistics, said the ""Mission: Impossible"" actor's performance could potentially be a big draw. People will be intrigued to see a star in this role who isn't usually associated with singing and dancing, said Simonoff, who co-wrote a recent study titled ""Broadway Show Survival."" Then there's Zeta-Jones, who won an Academy Award for her role as Velma Kelly in ""Chicago."" Simonoff's research says musicals last much longer than other types of productions on Broadway. That might play into Hollywood's motivation for adapting such stories. If a Broadway show that costs $350 for a family of four in New York can be successful, Simonoff reasoned, why wouldn't a movie version, that costs about $45 for that same family, do well? That said, ""You get less of the spectacular aspect in the movies than you do in the theater,"" he said. ""Music is playing, dancing is going on, and you really feel it a lot more than you do on the movie screen. ... Movie musicals do get hurt by that."" On Broadway, ""There's that suspension of disbelief that you go in with,"" Simonoff added. ""You know it's on a stage. When you watch a movie, there's still some suspension of disbelief, but it feels more jarring when people suddenly burst into song."" In other words, the fact that the actors in ""Rock of Ages"" are constantly reacting to musical numbers could work in the film's favor. Some people might find it odd if Sherrie, played by Julianne Hough, was sitting on a bus singing and nobody around her seemed to notice, Viagas said. Most of the musicals that have done well at the box office of late have used a mix of dialogue and music to move a story along, much like ""Rock of Ages."" So it will be interesting to see how ""Les MisÃ©rables,"" a fully sung musical, performs at the box office when it opens in December, Viagas added. The ""Rock of Ages"" movie soundtrack, which debuted at No. 15 on the Billboard 200, and No. 1 on the Soundtrack chart, will likely have a better week after the film opens, said Phil Gallo, a senior correspondent at Billboard. Soundtracks aren't huge moneymakers anymore, Gallo said. ""Garden State,"" which earned Zach Braff the Grammy Award for best compilation soundtrack for a motion picture in 2005, was ""the last, sort of, collection of music by artists that would ... greatly enhance the value of a film."" Even the ""Hairspray"" soundtrack debuted on the Billboard 200 at No. 20 before peaking at No. 2. But ""Rock of Ages"" is driven by '80s hits like ""Hit Me With Your Best Shot,"" ""Don't Stop Believin' "" and ""Every Rose Has Its Thorn."" ""'Rock of Ages' is filled with 11 o'clock numbers,"" Gallo said. Get ready to start singing on that bus.

"(CNN) -- David Letterman paid tribute to his longtime friend Robin Williams in a 10-minute segment on Monday's ""Late Show With David Letterman."" ""I knew Robin Williams for 38 years -- 38 years -- which, in and of itself, is crazy,"" Letterman recalled in an extended reminiscence. Williams died August 11 at his Marin County, California, home. He was 63. Officials: Williams apparently hanged himself with belt . The two met at the Comedy Store, the famed West Hollywood comedy club, and Letterman remembered the first time he saw Williams -- who had been introduced as being from Scotland -- on stage. He said he and his friends were ""feeling pretty smug,"" expecting trite jokes about haggis and the like. Instead, what they saw was Williams as audiences got to know him: a brilliant dervish, changing accents and making jokes faster than most people could think. ""It's like nothing we had ever seen before, nothing we'd ever imagined before,"" Letterman said. ""We're like morning dew, he comes in like a hurricane. ... He finishes, and I thought, 'Oh, that's it, they're going to have to put an end to show business.' "" Robin Williams and the next generation of comics . Williams quickly became a star, first with an appearance on ""Happy Days"" as the alien Mork and then with the popular series ""Mork & Mindy."" Letterman had a small role on one episode, thanks to Williams. The comedian and actor later came on Letterman's NBC and CBS talk shows a total of 50 times, Letterman said. After showing a short video tribute of those appearances, Letterman noted that Williams' death had caught him, like so many, off guard. ""What I will add here is that, beyond being a very talented man and a good friend and a gentleman, I am sorry I, like everybody else, had no idea that the man was in pain and the man was suffering,"" said the visibly emotional host.

"(CNN) -- A Florida jury awarded a widow $23.6 billion in punitive damages in her lawsuit against tobacco giant R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, her lawyer said. Cynthia Robinson claimed that smoking killed her husband, Michael Johnson, in 1996. She argued R.J. Reynolds was negligent in not informing him that nicotine is addictive and smoking can cause lung cancer. Johnson started smoking when he was 13 and died of lung cancer when he was 36. The jury award Friday evening is ""courageous,"" said Robinson's lawyer, Christopher Chestnut. ""If anyone saw the documents that this jury saw, I believe that person would have awarded a similar or greater verdict amount,"" he said. The Escambia County trial took four weeks and the jury deliberated for 15 hours, according to the Pensacola News Journal. The verdict included more than $16 million in compensatory damages, the newspaper said. Nine ex-smokers on their last cigarette . Chestnut said five of the six jurors who heard the case were 45 or younger, which meant he had to show them how the tobacco industry presented its product before the public awareness campaigns on tobacco risks and dangers in the 1990s. In a statement, J. Jeffery Raborn, vice president and assistant general counsel for R. J. Reynolds, said, ""The damages awarded in this case are grossly excessive and impermissible under state and constitutional law. ""This verdict goes far beyond the realm of reasonableness and fairness and is completely inconsistent with the evidence presented,"" said Raborn. ""We plan to file post-trial motions with the trial court promptly and are confident that the court will follow the law and not allow this runaway verdict to stand."" Robinson's case was once part of a class-action lawsuit in which a jury had awarded $145 billion in damages, but in 2006 the Florida Supreme Court overturned that verdict. In its ruling, however, the state's high court opened the door for individual lawsuits against tobacco companies. Robinson filed her lawsuit in 2008.

"(CNN) -- When the U.S. economy collapsed, millions of us lost our homes, our jobs, our retirement savings and our faith in the American dream. What we gained was a very clear view of the vast -- and growing -- divide between the rich and the rest of us. Like many hardworking Americans earning minimum wage, Margaret Lewis knows firsthand what it's like to live on the edge. She works as a transporter for passengers with disabilities at O'Hare International Airport. She wakes up at 1 a.m. to go to work, and spends the early morning hours pushing wheelchairs to gates and helping travelers on and off planes. With tips, and Illinois' minimum wage -- which is $1 above the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour -- Margaret makes about $18,000 a year, or $10,000 below the federal poverty limit for a household of five. Margaret lives with her four school-age children in a three-bedroom apartment on Chicago's South Side. Two recent shootings on her block make her fear for her children's safety, but she cannot afford to move. Margaret is unable to pay the $850 per month rent, so she and her family perform janitorial tasks for the landlord to make ends meet. The children's clothing is all secondhand, Margaret uses food stamps to make sure everyone is fed and when it is time to buy shoes for school, she has to save an entire paycheck. Tuesday marked the third anniversary of the last increase in the federal minimum wage. For the last three years, while the prices of gas and milk have risen steadily and the richest 1% have enjoyed huge tax breaks, the federal minimum wage has remained frozen at $7.25 an hour, which amounts to just $15,080 a year -- as long as you get paid for any time you take off. That's more than $7,000 below the federal poverty line for a family of four. As a result, the purchasing power of the minimum wage has slowly eroded -- in just three years, its real value has sunk to $6.77 per hour, a nearly 50-cent drop. The Bush tax cuts, which are simply the perquisite of the moment for the 1%, allow for the richest to prosper at the expense of middle-class and low-income workers. While CEOs make millions and their corporations make billions as part of a so-called economic recovery, the majority of Americans are struggling to make ends meet. This struggle is exacerbated by the low federal minimum wage. As middle-class jobs are increasingly replaced by low-wage work, however, this is the economic reality for a growing number of Americans. Unless Congress raises the federal minimum wage, economic security for workers in low-wage jobs, the fastest-growing sector, will disappear. It is incumbent on members of Congress to raise the federal minimum wage and index it to inflation, putting more money into the pockets of ordinary Americans to boost our economy and aid a real, long-term recovery. The Rebuild America Act has been introduced in both the House and the Senate to do just that, while also raising the federal minimum wage for tipped workers, which has been a meager $2.13 since 1991. The Fair Minimum Wage Act, not yet introduced, is also a call for a more decent wage. Support for these bills is support for an economic recovery that extends to all Americans. This legislation could make a difference for Bruce Gross, a father of three in Baltimore. He worked as a sandblaster, supporting his wife, their twin boys, daughter and two nephews, until the economy crashed. Now, Bruce makes $7.36 an hour as a telemarketer. Bruce's wife is sick and unable to work, leaving him as the sole breadwinner. Bruce estimates he brings home about $200 every other week and his bills are more than double that. Bruce and his family recently sat in the dark for a few days because he had to choose between paying his electric bill and buying groceries. When things got really rough, Bruce asked neighbors if they could spare a few slices of bread and some cheese for sandwiches. He is heartbroken that he is unable to provide even basic necessities, like food and school supplies, for his children. People who work for a living should be able to make a living from their work. Low-wage workers should not have to scrape by, while many of the companies they work for are making more money now than they were three years ago. The federal minimum wage hasn't kept up with inflation, but CEO pay has risen 725% over the last 30 years and 80% of all real income growth has gone to the richest 1% of Americans. The real value of the minimum wage peaked in 1968. Had it kept pace with rising living costs, the minimum wage would exceed $10.50 per hour today. Meanwhile, the U.S. economy has been reorganizing over the past 30 years away from middle-wage jobs in manufacturing and construction and toward low-paying jobs in the rapidly expanding service, retail and restaurant industries. We have little reason to expect large corporations that are the principal employers of low-wage workers to voluntarily offer higher pay; rock bottom wages are a core profit-making strategy for retail giants and fast food chains. Nor does reality match the myth that prosperity at the top will eventually ""trickle down"" to workers at the bottom: corporate profits are at their highest level as a share of GDP, and wages at their lowest, since the 1950s. Neither facts nor common sense support a federal minimum wage stuck at $7.25. It wasn't low-wage workers who crashed the economy. It was not a raise for these workers, but rather an unquenchable thirst for profit, that led to Wall Street's disastrous game of financial Russian roulette. Why, then, should low-wage workers pay the price? How high must profits go before a modest wage increase isn't raised as a specter of impending corporate doom? It's easy to exploit such fears in this economic climate, but these tired old canards -- trotted out in every minimum wage fight -- are just an excuse for political inaction and continued corporate greed. The bottom line is that people who work for a living put their money right back into our economy. What business in this country needs right now is customers and too many hardworking Americans aren't making enough money to get by. If we raise the federal minimum wage and demand the 1% pay their fair share to reduce income inequality, we will boost our economy, help small business grow and create jobs.","Writers: Working at minimum wage, Americans can't keep families fed and clothed .

"(CNN) -- So, where'd everybody go? Baseball's Philadelphia Phillies' attendance is down 8,290 per home game from a year ago. Toronto Blue Jays and Texas Rangers, each down more than 4,000. Minnesota Twins, more than 3,000. Detroit Tigers, Washington Nationals, Atlanta Braves, Arizona Diamondbacks, Chicago White Sox, 2,000-plus. Baltimore Orioles, Chicago Cubs, Cincinnati Reds, Cleveland Indians, Colorado Rockies, New York Mets, San Diego Padres, Tampa Bay Rays .... down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down. Like they say, come on out, good seats still available! As baseball's yearly All-Star Game gets under way Tuesday night in Minneapolis, we will be bombarded with a lot of talk about what a great young star this guy is, or that guy is. ""You'll be hearing a lot about this guy."" ""This kid's going to be around a long, long time."" ""He's got 'future Hall of Famer' written all over him."" Of course we will. Of course he does. Never mind all the one-season wonders. The flashes in the pans. The golden boys who turned to rust. The All-Stars who were barely seen or heard from again. It's a frat party and everybody's up for it. Major League Baseball has never been better -- at least that's what somebody will tell you and sell you. Except it's untrue. Seventeen of the game's 30 teams have poorer attendance than a year ago at this time. World Series television ratings get more disappointing year after year. Household-name players -- I mean popular and scandal-free ones like Mariano Rivera and Derek Jeter -- have come to the ends of their careers, with no clear heir-apparents. Is there a star player of today you'd go out of your way to see? ""Hey, Felix Hernandez is in town!"" ""You wanna go to the ballpark tonight and see Adam Wainwright?"" Those are your All-Star starting pitchers. Would you recognize either one if you saw him coming toward you on the street? Baseball is losing its luster. As ticket prices get higher, interest goes lower. As options on television expand, baseball's grip on the American public gets ever more slippery. TV's audience for Game 1 of the 2004 World Series between the Boston Red Sox and St. Louis Cardinals came to approximately 25.4 million viewers. When the same two teams met in the World Series last October, Game 1's viewership was pegged at around 15 million. One year earlier a series between the San Francisco Giants and Detroit Tigers attracted the worst TV ratings of any World Series in the past 30 years. Players of great prowess and promise do still come along. Miguel Cabrera. Andrew McCutchen. Robinson Cano. Clayton Kershaw. A kid can capture imaginations in the blink of an eye. Mike Trout. Jose Abreu. Yu Darvish. Yasiel Puig. They also can vanish from the radar just as quickly. Albert Pujols now seems two-thirds the superstar he used to be. Prince Fielder, CC Sabathia, Matt Kemp, Ryan Howard ... not exactly the game's hottest names anymore. Stephen Strasburg .... wasn't he the pitcher we were all waiting for? We're still waiting. Derek Jeters do not come along every day. Oh, he isn't nearly as famous nationwide as New Yorkers think he is. You could go months in California or Texas or Ohio without meeting a soul who cares that this is Jeter's last season, let alone anyone who could tell you who ""the Captain"" is. Yet he is a rarity in baseball indeed, particularly in this era -- a standout from beginning to end, as well as a guy who never gave us cause to question what kind of guy he secretly must be. He's been about as controversial as a Muppet. Baseball could use more like him. They had better show themselves soon, too, because fewer and fewer people are watching. You'll hear somebody tonight call it the national pastime, but let me assure you of something: This nation can find other ways to pass the time.","Mike Downey: Attendance at Major League Baseball games is way down for many teams .

"(CNN) -- A cargo manifest showed that two dogs were among the casualties of the doomed Malaysian jet that fell from the sky in eastern Ukraine this week.

No more information was immediately available. Non-living items on board included aircraft parts, diplomatic papers and flowers, according to a cargo manifest released by Malaysia Airlines. Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 tore apart Thursday in the sky over Torez.

The plane had 298 people aboard, including 80 children, the United Nations said. Debris and bodies remain strewn across the countryside in eastern Ukraine.

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- Pro-Russian separatists struck two helicopters as well as a jet with portable air defense systems Wednesday in the Luhansk region of Ukraine. A source within the Ukrainian military confirmed the statement by the ""South-East Army,"" which claims the group downed an Ukrainian Su-25 military jet and a Mi-24 helicopter. Another Ukrainian Mi-24 helicopter was struck, also in the Luhansk region, but it is unclear as to whether that aircraft crashed. On Sunday, a Ukrainian fighter jet was shot down in the Luhansk region, Leonid Matyuhin, the spokesman for Ukraine's counterterrorist operation, told CNN. The pilot managed to eject and is safe, Ukrainian state media reported. The ongoing fighting -- sparked last year with by political crisis over whether Ukraine would seek closer ties with Europe or Russia -- has left more than 2,000 people dead and just under 5,000 wounded in eastern Ukraine since mid-April, according to estimates from U.N. officials. The United States and the European Union have applied steadily increasing sanctions against Russian officials, banks and other interests since March, when Russia annexed the Black Sea Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea. Who are Ukraine's pro-Russia rebels? Russia's move came a month after Ukraine's parliament ousted pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych. Yanukovych left office after violent protests against his government in the capital, Kiev. Those protests were motivated in part by his decision to back out of a trade deal with the European Union in favor of closer ties with Russia.

"(CNN) -- Think of eight people you know. One of them may go to bed hungry tonight. Not surprisingly, about 98% of hungry people live in developing countries and the crisis will likely get worse. Over the next 12 years, the United Nations projects the global population will hit 8 billion people. If we want to solve the problem, we first have to target the people who produce the food. For nearly 70 years, Heifer International has been working with small farming communities to raise productivity and create a surplus that can be sold or provided to other hungry people. Next, we focus on the women. There are 600 million small farmers and herders in the world, but one of the key reasons there are so many hungry people is because nearly half of those farmers are women. Even though they are as equally capable as male farmers, these women face challenges that cause them to grow less food. According to a recent report by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), women farmers typically have less land to farm and probably don't own that land. They own fewer farm animals and have less access to improved seeds. In addition, they have lower education levels than men and are less likely to get credit or insurance. In fact, if women farmers were on the same playing field as their male counterparts, the FAO says the number of hungry people in the world would be reduced by up to 17%. So how do we level that playing field? We connect the unconnected. This is simply organizing farmers -- connecting them to each other, to supply chains and then to markets. But it goes deeper than traditional community development. Communities have to become engaged in a journey of personal transformation as individuals, families and villages. For success to be solid, there must be harmony that connects and heals the psychological and social effects of generations of poverty and hunger. It takes months of training for this transformation to take root. Only then does the physical transfer of livestock and other agricultural inputs like goats, heifers, seeds or trees take place. Then we prepare the families and work together to build pro-poor, wealth-creating systems to get their products into markets. The transformation we witness in community after community is a path from hopelessness to a sense of personal leadership, ownership and purpose. Self-confidence is built and equality develops between men and women. It is so powerful to watch people being incredibly proud that they have made the step from feeling oppressed, diminished and insignificant to becoming part of the solution. One of our largest programs is Rural Entrepreneurs for Agricultural Cooperation in Haiti. It's a five-year commitment to rebuild rural communities and improve economic opportunities. By the end of the project, we will have helped more than 20,000 vulnerable rural families with jobs, skills training and disaster preparedness. Working faster and bigger has to be our ultimate goal so that the small farmers of today can be fed and can prepare for the rapidly growing population. Success will depend on deeply embedded social engagement on the part of those farmers. And, on our part, to connect with them in ways that are supportive, patient and ultimately highly productive. Ending world hunger can be done.","About 98% of hungry people live in developing countries .

"(CNN) -- I haven't had a single Diet Coke in 2014. It was a conscious health decision, and the only real side effect, now, is that the world is awful and I hate everything. Including puppies. Quite frankly, my life was much better when I drank Diet Coke. It had purpose. Mind you, that purpose was to spend seven hours a day in front of a urinal. But some really good ideas came out of that. ""Andrew, we should totally build an ark."" I've actually written before about my Diet Coke addiction. It was legitimately bad. There was even a short period where it was pretty much all I drank. For instance, I would come home from a jog, tired and dehydrated having just spent a whole 20 minutes mildly exerting myself, and then I'd take long, deep pulls from a two-liter bottle, fresh and cold right out of the fridge. Just do it. Of course I miss Diet Coke, and I still get the urges. But it usually ends after about an hour when one of the neighbors sees me crying in the street without pants and calls the cops. Thankfully, however, all that seems to be a thing of the past, because now there's a new virtual reality video game that lets you digitally enjoy the greatest pleasure in all the world. It's called Soda Drinker Pro. And it's totally real. I played it. The game was created by 33-year-old Will Brierly of Cambridge, Massachusetts, and, like all good innovations, it was inspired by laziness. ""I woke up in the middle of the night and needed a soda,"" he told me via e-mail. ""Unfortunately, I didn't have one, so I decided to make a simulated soda."" Amazingly, over the course of one day, Brierly created the first five levels of Soda Drinker Pro. Which is probably why the graphics are what some experts might call complete and utter crap. But that's part of the Soda Drinker Pro charm. It's purposefully absurd, and, remember, this thing was built in a day. So, the game isn't exactly Rome. It's more like Tulsa. And the rules are pretty simple. You walk around different environments with a virtual soda in your hand, click left to put the straw up to your mouth, and then click right to simulate drinking. You hear the sound of draining fluid, and your soda levels deplete as you hold down the click. And that's pretty much it. May the odds be ever in your favor. Truth be told, I didn't actually play long enough to get past levels one and two (the beach and the park, respectively), but I'm sort of hoping that one of the now 100-plus levels is a drainage ditch in Tijuana so I can recreate some of my darkest moments with Diet Coke. ""SeÃ±or, usted estÃ¡ asustando a los niÃ±os."" Now, this might all sound a bit silly, and the bad graphics and simplistic game play are fine for goofing off on your Mac or PC, but Brierly has actually taken his ""first person soda"" to the next legitimate level of gaming. He proudly boasts that it has Kinect support for Xbox One, and that console will also offer exclusive levels of drinking soda throughout time. Like the Roaring 20s. Or, say, 1972. And Soda Drinker Pro even has Oculus Rift support. (Note to Dad: Oculus Rift is that incredible virtual reality software Facebook bought for $2 billion.) (Note to Dad: Facebook is that website mom is always on.) (Note to Dad: Virtual reality is ... oh, screw it. Never mind.) Beyond the fact that it's catching on at all -- albeit ironically -- it's also interesting that it's happening now. Brierly created the game six years ago, but it took a rather captive audience to get it off the ground. He explains, ""I didn't show anyone except some friends, but last year I did a presentation of Soda Drinker Pro at a soda drinking convention in Providence."" You read that correctly. There's literally something called the Providence Soda Club, and apparently they hold a convention. Which, I suppose, shouldn't be that unexpected. Rhode Island is so weird. It's not even an island. It's more like Tulsa. Follow @JarrettBellini on Twitter.","Soda Drinker Pro is a virtual reality game that simulates enjoying a soft drink .

"(CNN) -- MotoGP riders have led tributes to Colin Edwards after he announced his decision to retire from the sport at the end of 2014. Edwards, 40, is opting to bring the curtain down on a 22-year career that has brought him much success across the spectrum of motorbike racing. The American, currently with NGM Forward Racing, arrived in MotoGP in 2003 and has gone on to rack up 12 podium finishes since then. However, his most memorable triumphs came during his World Superbike days, landing the World Championship twice in 2000 and 2002. Edwards, who recorded a ninth-place finish in last month's season-opening Grand Prix of Qatar, revealed the news of his impending plans ahead of this weekend's Grand Prix of the Americas. ""In testing this year I could see that I need to change my riding style and it is against my instinct to ride differently so that has had an effect,"" he told reporters. ""I want to spend more time with my wife and my children and of course I want to say thanks to Yamaha and everyone who has helped me in my career."" Edwards' achievements since turning professional in 1992 have not gone unnoticed, with a number of his peers lining up to offer glowing tributes. Marc Marquez, who became the youngest ever rider to win the MotoGP World Championship last year at the age of 20, was full of praise for the American's longevity. ""Colin started riding at the top when I was just two years old,"" he said. ""I hope I can ride for as long as he has and I think he can be really proud of his career."" Six-time MotoGP world champion, Valentino Rossi, was sorry to hear of the news and feels the sport will be losing a great in Edwards. ""I am very sad about the news of Colin's retirement as he is one of my best friends in the paddock,"" he said. ""He is a great guy and a great rider."" Edwards' compatriot Nicky Hayden, meanwhile, added: ""I always look at Colin and admire the energy he has with so many miles and so many years behind him. ""It's a shame to be losing a fellow American from the sport. I hope he takes it easy for the rest of the year and takes it easy on the rest of us!""

Chris Ferrell, owner of Nashville's Pit and Barrel bar, told police he shot Mills, 44, in self-defense, according to a Nashville police statement. ""Wayne Mills by definition is one that is a stiff-necked, country troubadour with an affinity for honky-tonks and possessing a style of rustic simplicity,"" his official website said. He's an ""average country boy steeped in the Southern vernacular of God, guns and football,"" his official biography reads. Investigators say Mills and Ferrell, 44, were in the closed bar with ""a few friends and acquaintances"" when the two men -- who were friends -- ""began to argue and the others left."" Police are investigating Ferrell's claim that the shooting was justified by self-defense. Mills, who leads the Wayne Mills Band, died at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville hours after the shooting, according to band manager J.R. Smith . Smith told CNN that Mills suffered a bullet wound to his head. ""I hope justice is served,"" Smith said. Mills grew up in the north Alabama town of Arab, Smith said. He played baseball at Wallace State Junior College and football at the University of Alabama, where he earned an education degree, before becoming a professional musician. Mills had been working on his seventh album, ""Long Hard Road,"" and touring small Southern venues. His next gig had been scheduled for Saturday night at Granddaddy's Lounge in Ramer, Alabama.

"BUCHAREST, Romania (Reuters)  -- In the mobile phone version of the ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" video game, the torches hanging along the dark walls of Hogwarts glow in an eerily realistic fashion. Romania is known for its strong computing and language skills coupled with cheap labor. ""We invented the technology, it's called 'dynamic lighting',"" said Mihai Pohontu, general manager of Romania's mobile phone branch of Electronic Arts Inc, the world's biggest video game publisher. Romanian programmers, such as Pohontu's team, are among the most sought-after in the world as large international IT companies turn to the east European country to take advantage of strong computing and language skills coupled with cheap labor. Its computer literacy is not without its dark side -- the country has an unenviable reputation as a hotbed for computer fraud and a large community of hackers. But legitimate IT is one of Romania's fastest growing export sectors with turnover of about 1 billion euros ($1.38 billion). Roughly 90 percent of some 1,000 IT companies in Romania are foreign-owned and the government hopes exports will reach 1 billion euros in the next couple of years. In February, Bill Gates opened a Microsoft Corp. technical support center in Bucharest. The investment followed, among others, the launch of a development center by Amazon.com Inc in the university town of Iasi in 2005. That is the online retailer's only software development hub in Europe besides one in Scotland's Edinburgh. Other centers are located in India, the United States and South Africa. ""Romanian programmers are exceptionally creative. And in games, you need to explore,"" said Pohontu. Prospects for large cash inflows from the European Union after Romania joined the bloc this January, cut-rate taxes and low wages add to Romania's appeal. ""In Eastern Europe, Romania is appreciated as having the biggest growth potential together with Turkey and Russia,"" said Stefan Cojanu, head of Oracle Corp in Romania. The software maker, which has a support and software development center in Romania, has doubled its local staff to 1,000 over the last year since opening a tower office in central Bucharest. It plans to hire an additional 500 employees. ""The geographical distance, the similar time zone and business mentality argue for us to develop our activities in a country where costs are also lower,"" Cojanu said. Romania's low wages of around $600 a month compare with $1,050 in Poland and $950 in the Czech Republic. Both countries also attract hefty investment in the IT sector. However, some see a risk the sector is overheating. Double-digit wage growth and a shortage of skilled labor is dampening the enthusiasm of some investors and Romania is struggling with emigration as workers leave for better pay. ""The battle for specialists is very intense,"" said Ana Ber, head of human resources firm Dr.Pendl & Dr.Piswanger. ""There aren't enough of them, especially as many emigrated."" Industry observers say this state of affairs has prompted companies to focus on building support or software development centers, which need cheaper and lower skilled labor, rather than hiring high-end programmers. ""Romania remains good for outsourcing but not for first-class software authors,"" said Dragos Stanescu, sales and marketing manager at GECAD, a Romanian company that sold RAV Antivirus technology to Microsoft in 2003. ""The brains are already with companies that have good salaries and it is costly to buy them. A good senior programmer can earn 2,000 euros gross a month. Plus a 30 percent raise to buy him, and you have a salary of a good programmer in Germany."" FBI data show Romania may be the biggest single source of online auction fraud in the world, a multi-million dollar industry that scams people using Web sites like eBay. ""It's highly organized. They create fake accounts to trick people into thinking they are insured,"" said Gary Dickson, FBI representative in Romania. ""If Romanians were stopped, the amount of online fraud would drop significantly."" Experts say some 70 percent of software used in Romania is pirated, and salesmen still visit office buildings in central Bucharest to sell pirated CDs and DVDs. Some hackers hope their skills will help secure employment, although breaking into other people's networks for fame or as part of a job CV has its dangers. ""The Romanian hacking community is quite large. They see the computer as a ticket out of the country. It is the easiest way to get a better-paid job abroad,"" said Victor Faur. He faces a potential 54-year jail term if convicted on charges of hacking into U.S. government computers, including NASA. He was indicted in 2006. ""I saw a computer for the first time when I was 14. And I was glued (to it),"" said Faur, 23. E-mail to a friend . Copyright 2007 Reuters.

"(CNN) -- About a year after the 2005 London bombings, right-wing British journalist Melanie Phillips published a book that she called ""Londonistan."" It was an extended lament about what she called the decline of British values and the destructive consequences of multiculturalism. U.S. security agencies and others began to call the British capital Londonistan -- and only partly in jest. London, one of the great cities of the world that transcend nationality, had attracted dissidents from many countries, but particularly from Arab states that might have treated them harshly had they dared to voice their opposition to the ruling cliques at home. The Londonistan label was meant to draw a parallel between what was happening in London and what had happened in Afghanistan, where many opponents of the regimes of Muslim majority countries had congregated, first to join a war against the Soviet occupation, and then to fight a broader enemy. Now, Douglas Murray has written a similar article in the most recent edition of The Spectator, a well-respected British periodical, following the gruesome killing in Syria of the American journalist James Foley, apparently by a British member of ISIS. Murray argues that the nationality of the executioner should come as no surprise, given the misguided tolerance of extremism in Britain. It is true that British citizens have taken part in terrorist attacks, or attempted to, since the rise of global terrorism in the 1990s. But to suggest that Foley's beheading was somehow related to the laxness or timidity of the British security authorities, or a decline of the British state more generally, is going too far. It is also the wrong way to look at the problem. Britain, like the United States, has a well-deserved reputation for acting in accordance with the rule of law. And by and large, British justice is fair and impartial. That is surely one of the reasons why so many people have tried to enter the country. Those who have faced persecution at home have found the freedoms of expression and assembly denied them elsewhere available in every corner of London and other British cities. And British life has been enriched by their presence. Certainly it's led to social tensions. New communities establish traditions that the original population finds strange and even threatening. Immigrants seem to keep themselves apart and are prepared to work longer for less. Originally the government aimed to assimilate these newcomers, but realized that defining ""Britishness"" was hard enough for the British, let alone a concept that a new arrival could understand. Integration became the new objective, but this too is difficult in a society that's under strain and believes the best policy is a clear set of rules that still allow people to find their own way within them. Committing terrorist acts is not within the rules. And recent British legislation has tried to set firmer and clearer rules that make plotting terrorist acts a crime -- however hard it may be to identify a crime before it has been committed. This may help to deter and prevent terrorism, or it may not. It is always hard to measure what did not happen as a result of government action. The best way to deter terrorism is not to introduce ever-more draconian laws -- which inevitably miss their targets but affect everyone else -- but to continue to hold true to the values that terrorists seek to challenge. In the dark world of the self-described Islamic State, the law and its implementation are arbitrarily applied by those who hold the guns. There is no appeal against them. It is a world of intimidation and dictatorship, similar to but worse than the totalitarian states established by Saddam Hussein and Hafez Assad. Some British people may feel alienated from society in the United Kingdom; they may believe that they lack opportunity. But they are lucky to have the opportunity to say so, and to advocate for change. They would not have that in the ""Islamic State."" They would be dead. British people may have gone to join the ""Islamic State'"" hoping to find a new sense of purpose and self-expression, and perhaps the British fighters associated with Foley's death believe they have succeeded. But they are not the product of the United Kingdom. They are the product of something far deeper, rooted in the evolution of their own societies and the transitional period between immigrant parents and integrated children. If society is not fluid, and does not accept the rough ride that fluidity can bring, it will not move forward. Terrorism, as expressed by Foley's executioner, is reactionary and backward looking. It offers nothing to anyone. The ""Islamic State"" will never attract support from more than the handful of people who run it, and of the few hundred British people who may think it offers Nirvana and have gone to join in, I predict that the great majority will sooner or later look back at what they left and wish they were still there, however imperfect the conditions. Freedom comes at a price, but it is what we are fighting for as we combat the ""Islamic State.""","UK's tolerance of extremism leads to acts like James Foley's beheading, article suggests .

"(CNN) -- Some tennis players say they look deep into draws. Others claim they simply look at their next opponent. But one thing everyone agrees on is that draws can make all the difference. Take Wimbledon, for example. When organizers went against the world rankings and named Novak Djokovic as the top seed instead of Rafael Nadal, who was pushed down to No. 2, it helped the former. Nadal's early path was filled with hard-hitting, dangerous players and the Spaniard suffered yet another upset at the All England Club, losing to Australia's Nick Kyrgios in the fourth round. Djokovic, meanwhile, had a less bumpy road to the second week and he stepped up his game in the final to top Roger Federer. Federer, of course, wasn't such an easy draw for Djokovic, especially on grass. The two took part in a five-set classic and without an injured Nadal at the U.S. Open, they'll be expected to meet in the final again in New York in a little over two weeks, despite a recent wobble from Djokovic. As the top two seeds, they were placed on opposite sides of the draw Thursday, with Djokovic appearing to land in the more difficult half. He could face 2012 champion Andy Murray or resurgent Rogers Cup winner Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the quarterfinals and either Stan Wawrinka or the big-serving Milos Raonic in the last four. Wawrinka upset Djokovic on the hard courts of the Australian Open in January and stretched Djokovic to five sets at the U.S. Open last year. Djokovic, like Murray, isn't in great form, having slumped at warm-up tournaments. Federer, going for an 18th major, might meet huge servers in the second and third rounds, Sam Groth and Ivo Karlovic, and the highest seed in his quarter is the man who has been compared to the Swiss, Grigor Dimitrov. In his half lie fourth seed David Ferrer -- Federer is 16-0 against the highest-ranked Spaniard at the tournament in Nadal's absence -- and Tomas Berdych. Although Berdych has ousted Federer in two of their last three encounters, one at the U.S. Open in 2012, he enters the event in poor form and confronts feisty Aussie Lleyton Hewitt in the first round. In the women's draw, Ana Ivanovic surfaced in the same quarter as Serena Williams, who is trying to reach a grand slam quarterfinal for the first time this season. Williams crashed out early in Melbourne, Paris and London, but she beat Ivanovic to win the Western & Southern Open in Cincinnati last weekend. Also in her half are Wimbledon finalists Petra Kvitova and Eugenie Bouchard. Both have struggled since leaving the grass, yet in Bouchard's case that might be due to injury. Whoever emerges from the fourth quarter will be the favorite to reach the final, and the leading contenders are Simona Halep, Maria Sharapova and Venus Williams. Sharapova trumped Halep in the French Open final and won another bruising contest in Cincinnati last week. Venus Williams is an elder stateswoman at 34 but her first-round foe, Japan's Kimiko Date-Krumm, is even older at nearly 44. The last time they met at a major, Venus Williams prevailed 8-6 in the third set at Wimbledon in 2011.","Roger Federer plays his first-round match at the U.S. Open against Marinko Matosevic .

"Sandy Springs, Georgia (CNN) -- The old Chevrolet paint and body shop was vacant -- 24,000 square feet of metal and concrete surrounded by a sea of asphalt. But when some members of Congregation Or Hadash saw it, they saw a home. Since it was founded in 2003, the conservative Jewish congregation had bounced from location to location outside Atlanta -- a Methodist church, a windowless space in a school, any place they could rent or borrow as they grew. ""Sometimes, from week to week, we didn't know exactly where we were going to be,"" said Fred Wachter, president of the congregation and a member since its early years. ""All the while ... we probably walked every piece of available property and real estate in Sandy Springs, trying to find something, anything, that would look like it."" In 2010, the congregation purchased the former auto shop, seeing the promise of their own synagogue in its bare white walls. ""That was the first leap of imagination someone had to make, and it's a big leap,"" said architect Brian Bell, whose firm, BLDGS, worked on the synagogue. In architecture, it's called adaptive reuse -- remaking old buildings for new purposes. Bell and his partner, David Yocum, aren't Jewish, and they had never before worked on a religious structure. But the Georgia Tech faculty members had transformed several old buildings and an ""uncanny"" number of automotive spaces: A carriage house-turned-art gallery, a renovated a truck depot that became the Atlanta Contemporary Art Center and their own office, which is housed within a former Atlanta auto parts shop. There was nothing sacred about the auto shop, a spare structure built in the 1990s. But it was available, affordable and allowed the congregation to remain central to its members, all while healing a patch of earth that had been left neglected. ""Or Hadash,"" members point out, means ""new light"" in Hebrew. ""There was not an ounce of excess to it,"" Bell said of the old building. ""Even with this harsh industrial site, the idea was to impart their principles and values onto the site."" The congregation wanted its home to work for 362 days of the year, with a large sanctuary, social hall and classrooms for its 400 member families. They could always find a larger venue for the Jewish High Holidays, when more people attend services. They planned on an energy efficient, environmentally sound space and to send as little to the landfill as possible. They needed to stay within their budget -- $4.8 million to purchase and transform a building -- and refused to name spaces after donors, even if it would've raised more money. In their synagogue, they wanted everyone to feel equal. ""We really were able to think about how we wanted to do it and to make decisions over a period of time,"" said Wachter, who led the congregation's building committee. ""Everything was done very deliberately."" Or Hadash Rabbis Mario Karpuj and Analia Bortz, a married couple from Argentina, set the tone for the contemporary design of the space, and members weighed in with their own ideas. They didn't want anything ornate or fancy, but where there's color on the walls, it's warm and bright. The lobby was built to feel welcoming, like a hotel. In the sanctuary, the walls and ceiling are artfully askew, ""so your eye and mind can wander,"" said Bell, the architect. The bema, the podium at the center of the room, is positioned to be wheelchair accessible and keep all members level. High windows obscure the parking lot surrounding the building but reveal a border of trees. Skylights were placed to highlight the ark, the closet that holds the synagogue's Torah scrolls, as well as its ""infinite"" glass door and the Hebrew alphabet etched into it. The sanctuary was engineered to maximize acoustic performance. Services at Or Hadash often include music, and congregants speak to each other from across the room. In their old space, low drop ceilings meant they struggled to hear one another. Now, their voices are loud and clear. ""It's really something amazing,"" Wachter said. ""The ability to really be able to enjoy the rich sounds within the sanctuary is something that really makes a difference."" Congregation Or Hadash moved into its new home at the end of February, after less than a year of construction. This month, the building was honored in the Georgia chapter of the American Institute of Architects' Design Awards. Visitors are often wowed by the change and stunned to learn the building's history, said Bruce Warschoff, the congregation's executive director. As much as members love the space, they love the story. ""Once we found a place in existence, the idea of repurposing made sense,"" Warschoff said. ""It's nice to have room to spread out."" Even now, there are reminders of the building's past -- they kept the same footprint, and some of the original exterior walls, steel structure and concrete blocks remain visible. The old concrete floor is freshly polished, but watchful eyes can spot outlines of the former auto bays and windows where cars used to drive in. They kept the posts that used to guide cars inside, but painted them a warm red to contrast with the new gray exterior. Even concrete in the new courtyard is original but cut to improve drainage and create a new look. The congregation is gradually growing into the building. Flags still mark where plants and flowers will go in the ground, and the walls will remain clear of artwork until they better understand their own space. There are plans to improve classrooms and their kosher kitchen later, but they're grateful now for a consistent space with room to grow. It's a complete transformation, said Bell, the architect, even between the steel ceiling and concrete floor. ""You have to transform it. If you leave it too much the same, it doesn't have the potential to enlighten us,"" Bell said. ""We're always trying to break out out of the big box we started with.""","Congregation Or Hadash's synagogue is built from a former auto paint shop .

"(CNN)  -- It's an empirical fact: There are people out there who hate you. It doesn't matter how nice you are, or how many smiley face stickers and free hugs you dole out, there are probably a couple of people out there who rue the day you were born. (Likely us, if you do, indeed, dole out ""free hugs."") And never is this animosity so evident as it is on the Internet. Think about it: Before the advent of the Web, the average person lived in blissful ignorance of the ire of others, only catching whispers on the windblown grapevine of malcontent. Now, you have the potential to invoke someone's wrath with every blog entry, Facebook update and tweet. So how does one respond to this digital dislike? Read on, dear readers (10% of whom we likely disdain, and vice versa): . In the event of a passive-aggressive Facebooker . There are more than 650 million people on Facebook, and unless you're a solid adherent to Dunbar's Number and have carefully restricted those friend requests, you're probably ""friends"" with a couple of people you wouldn't actually call ""friend"" in real life. You know: high school classmates/tormentors, exes, former friends with whom you've had a falling out. If you were to run into said people on the street, they would probably do the whole, ""I'm staring at this poster for a children's yard sale that occurred three weeks ago very intently and therefore do not see you"" thing. On Facebook, some do the virtual equivalent: They block your access to photos and wall posts, (likely) remove you from their news feed and immediately toss out a ""Not Attending"" four seconds after you send them an invite to your ""Sock Puppet Sock Hop."" Yup, you're trapped in ""I'm being polite, but I hate you"" limbo, dear friend, and it's time to go on to the next world: one in which only friends dawdle in the sweet groves of amity. Translation: Unfriend those people posthaste. You have to grudgingly tolerate co-workers, extended family and B.O.-ridden elevator-sharers on a daily basis; don't let that same lenience spread into the realm of America's Favorite (Eye-glazing) Pastime. In the event of a Twitter war . Twitter wars have become the modern-day equivalent of the battles between Roman gladiators -- epic, public clashes that seem staged for the delight of a packed arena of rapt onlookers. We've seen some pretty intense examples in the realm of the celebrity (Kanye West, Courtney Love and various and sundry reality stars are repeat offenders), and, on a less buzzed-about scale, between friends and acquaintances. ""Social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter may bring (animosity) out more because of the massive and ready audience they supply,"" says Elias Aboujaoude, M.D., a psychiatrist and author of ""Virtually You: The Dangerous Powers of the E-Personality."" While the worst thing that could happen to a gladiator was being ripped limb from limb and possibly consumed by a lion, Twitter warriors face a much more dire (although less fatal) fate: an eternally damaged reputation. (Remember, guys, all of your tweets are being stored in the Library of Congress as we speak.) Why? Because Twitter fights are not courageous -- they're tacky. If someone slights you in 140 characters, we suggest sending them a Direct Message (if you give a damn about their opinion), or just blocking them and sticking to straight-up schadenfreude when it comes to entertainment. In the event of an all-out war . If you have a blog, YouTube channel or prominent place on an online forum dedicated to live action role-playing, you're going to have to fortify your gates against the trolls. The wonderful thing about the Internet is that it encourages everyone to have an opinion -- and the horrible thing about the Internet is that it affords everyone the ability to express it. As a general rule, if an under-the-bridge dweller sends you a mean e-mail, flames you in the comments section of your blog or pontificates on your unattractiveness under your latest cat grooming tutorial on YouTube, just don't engage. Said bumpy-faced one is looking to get a rise out of you, and executing a counterstrike will only result in more wholly eloquent zingers in the ""YOUUUU SUKKKK"" vein. Sports columnist Jeff Pearlman decided to track down and confront his trolls for a CNN column and found the whole ordeal to be an exercise in futility. ""It's sort of like stomping out ants with your foot,"" he says. ""It works temporarily, but then the ants come back even stronger. Truthfully, you're better off pretending these people don't exist. Because they're crying to be noticed; to have the platform you have. Engage them, you make their wish come true."" Still, that doesn't mean you have to suffer in martyred silence all the time. ""We should remember that any information attached to our name, whether it's accurate information we supply ourselves without thinking or mean-spirited and inaccurate statements made about us by haters, is going to stay online forever,"" says Aboujaoude. ""That is why standing up to hecklers can be an important part of maintaining our online reputation."" A simple fix is simply deleting any outright racist, rude or misogynistic comments from your own personal domains, or flagging abusive sentiments on the domains of others, and then contacting the webmaster. Or, you could be a little more creative. There have been some instances in which folks have stood up to trolls in a manner that entirely obliterated the original slight. For example, after one commenter posted a scathing -- albeit horrifyingly misspelled -- rant under a game on content creation site Newgrounds, the actor who voiced the game teamed up with a graphic designer to create a video dramatizing the venom-tinged words in all of their grammatically incorrect glory. That video, ""dot dot dot,"" went viral, in no small part because it was a clever retort to an impassioned troll, rather than a messy attack. The troll in question even ""Favorited"" the video. Sure, you can't make everyone on the Web like you. But grudging respect is sometimes more satisfying than blind adoration, anyway.","A  good and bad thing about the Internet is that it encourages everyone to have an opinion .

"(CNN) -- Here's a little secret BlackBerry doesn't want you to know: . It would be technically impossible for all Android phones or iPhones to experience a global four-day outage like the one BlackBerry saw this week, according to mobile communications experts. Why? The answer is in the technical details of how Research in Motion -- the company that makes BlackBerry smartphones, with their click-clacking keyboards and tie-wearing owners -- handles e-mails and text messages. Here's the gist: RIM acts as a middleman for all e-mail and BlackBerry text messages. It picks up messages from the wireless carrier and passes them on to the recipient. Androids and iPhones don't have a middleman for texts and e-mail. It's this BlackBerry baton-passing system that went down Monday, killing or slowing e-mail and texting services for millions of people in Europe, North America, South America, Asia, the Middle East and Africa. The ordeal lasted four days. ""It's because of the way RIM has set up the (network) architecture that is the downfall when it comes to these types of outages,"" said Sean Armstrong, who manages wireless communications at a large tech company. ""When it's working fine, it's a great system. When it's not working fine, it's a failure."" This week, it's fair to say the system was a big ol' failure. On social media sites, some BlackBerry users said they were so upset about the outage -- the largest in the company's history -- that they were switching to Apple iOS and Google Android devices. And customer satisfaction with BlackBerry already was low. ""Add up every other thing we've ever written about why BlackBerry is dying,"" wrote the tech blog Gizmodo. ""This is worse."" This is not to say that Androids and iPhones never experience network outages. But they wouldn't be global. And they would be the responsibility of a particular wireless carrier -- AT&T, Sprint, Verizon and T-Mobile -- or a particular messaging system, like Gmail, Hotmail or iMessage, Apple's new in-house messaging service. Not the maker of the phone. That makes their problems inherently more localized. ""All the stuff goes through them for some form or fashion,"" Nan Palmero, a writer for the site BlackBerryCool.com, said of the way BlackBerry handles messages and e-mail. That makes it possible, he said, for the global BlackBerry network to crash, which wouldn't be the case for iPhones or Androids. RIM, however, takes issue with this analysis. ""I would not characterize that as fair,"" RIM's co-CEO Mike Lazaridis said at a Thursday news conference. ""We run a global, secure-push environment that provides the kind of instant messaging that's made BlackBerry so compelling and so valuable."" RIM filters e-mails and BlackBerry messages through its own server farms -- giant warehouses full of computers -- for security reasons, said Armstrong. The company scrambles messages, making them more difficult to intercept. That's won BlackBerry big fans in the business world. The system also uses less battery power because RIM handles much of the computation work, Armstrong said. ""The process for checking your e-mail with a BlackBerry is done by the RIM servers,"" he said. ""So RIM is going to handle all the heavy lifting of going to your inbox and looking for new e-mail, and if it finds new e-mail, it's going to push it back your devices."" It also creates the risk of a global crash. But maybe that's not a completely bad thing. ""For two years, we haven't had a huge issue like this,"" Armstrong said. ""It's just been little bumps along the way. So I don't really see (the middle-man system) as a weakness. I see it as expected, because no system can be faultless."" Rich Miller, who runs the industry blog Data Center Knowledge, said it's clear BlackBerry was unprepared for a failure like the one that began on Monday. ""From what we can see from this outage, it appears RIM doesn't have the infrastructure or the process in place to handle a failure properly when it happens and then to recover from it once it's got a backlog of e-mail in its pipes,"" he said. RIM has said this week's outage was caused by a failure at one of its messaging servers in Europe, along with the subsequent failure of its backup system. Mike Gikas, a senior editor for technology at Consumer Reports, said problems like the one BlackBerry had this week could actually become more common because people are storing more of their data -- from photos to music and documents -- in the cloud, meaning on remote computer servers rather than at home. ""If these services ever get disrupted, that could just mean a lot of unhappy customers,"" he said. ""More and more of our stuff is stored on remote servers, and there's increasing burden on the networks to have them available 24/7."" As the BlackBerry outage shows, he said, not all of them are ready.","Experts: iPhones and Android devices will not see a global messaging crash .

"(CNN) -- As you may have read, Hachette Book Group (my publisher) is experiencing challenges with Amazon, as a result of negotiation over new selling terms for ebooks. The tactics used by Amazon to limit the sale of Hachette books to customers during this dispute are stirring up strong sentiments among authors and readers. The battle is taking place in a public forum, and is being noticed and discussed broadly. Amazon, the company founded by its CEO Jeff Bezos, is a brilliant innovator that has transformed bookselling and reading. It's one of the most important retail destinations where books are purchased. Bookstores -- both online and brick & mortar -- play a vital role in connecting readers with great books, and it is my hope that Hachette and Amazon will be able to resolve their differences soon, for the good of book lovers, and the authors they love to read. Now for confession time: I spend way too much time daydreaming about being Jeff Bezos. It's not that he's thinner than me. Or younger. It's not the superhuman confidence of his laugh. It's not the legacy of stunning innovations or his off-the-charts business intuition. It's not even his mind-boggling revenue stream. (I'm frankly boggled at my own revenue stream -- though it is just a stream next to his mighty rain forest river.) It's that I keep thinking about what a hero I could be, were I he. I think about how I, Jeff Bezos, have proven the theory that many, if not most people, would prefer not to get off their butts, get themselves to a store, make a purchase decision, carry it to the register, and carry the item back home when the purchase -- in this Internet-enabled age -- could more easily be delivered to them. But, at the same time, I think about how I, Jeff Bezos, am not so carried away with this success that I am going to lose sight of scale or sanity. Sure, I have ushered in the age of Internet commerce, but, no, I am not now hanging around just to collect my financial reward, or even to bask in the public recognition. You see, I, Jeff Bezos, am actually trying to make this a better world. Detroit, Tokyo, and Stuttgart might not like to hear me say it, but a million people driving a million cars back and forth to thousands of stores for their purchases is not just inefficient, it's wasteful (of energy, of resources, of time). A million people staying put, going about their lives, and mere hundreds of trucks delivering the people's algorithm-assisted purchases from a single marketplace -- that is sensible and right. But here is where I show that I'm not just an agent of change for change's sake, or an agent of efficiency for efficiency's sake. Here is where I show that Amazon is not a 20th-century-style behemoth ravening toward monopoly. Here is where I, Jeff Bezos, remind the world that my bazillion-dollar company came out of an online bookstore. Here is where I will make clear that Amazon has already been responsible -- directly responsible -- for getting millions of books into the hands and minds of millions and millions of people, and that this is nothing short of holy work. But, though perhaps I'm already a veritable saint of literature for how many book-reader connections I've made (arguably more than any single traditional bookseller, um, ever), I am not pointing to these laurels for resting purposes. I am mentioning them because for those of you who have really been paying attention, it shows what Amazon and I are really all about: I, Jeff Bezos, above all things, firmly believe that books -- great books, and the producers of those books -- are of paramount importance to humanity's salvation. You've heard about how I adored ""The Remains of the Day"" and about how I pushed my executives to read at least a half dozen titles, some of them novels? You think -- perhaps for the sake of everyday low-low prices -- I want to imperil the long-term, sensitive ecosystem that allowed these books to come into being? You think I want to be known as the man responsible for the biggest quality drought in the history of novel writing? You think I don't know that real-world booksellers and all the sales reps, agents, editors, assistants, and copy proofers whose livelihoods depend on the dusty old world of ""legacy"" publishing are not vestiges of a broken system, but part of a collaborative culture that has (over decades of author discovery and judicious advance payments) produced everything from ""Along Came a Spider"" to Amazon's book of the year, ""The Goldfinch?"" You think I don't know that books -- great books, especially -- are possibly the longest, hardest, most-blind-faith-requiring creative endeavor known to humankind -- and not just like any other ""product category"" in my Everything Store? You think I truly perceive publishers to be sickly gazelles and myself a herd-culling cheetah? Last time I looked, I was neither a very fast runner nor covered in spotted fur. Obviously these publishers -- however inefficient and old-fashioned (did you know many of them quaintly still let their employees do half-day Fridays in the summer?) -- remain the best way to find, nurture, and invest in up-and-coming authors. Yes, they have many silly and inefficient practices and still embrace technologies and administrative systems that make me wince, but I've been leaning on them and they have been getting better. So here's the headline, and not just for Washington Post readers: Today I am going to stop leaning on book publishers. I am going to stop brandishing Amazon's market share as a corrective cudgel. They needed a little remonstrative pressure, but now it's gone too far and they are doing what all embattled higher organisms do: They are joining forces against a common (though, as they will soon see, inaccurately perceived) enemy. Random House buys Penguin. Hachette absorbs Perseus. Trust me, if I'd wanted to disintermediate their old-fashioned carcasses, I, Jeff Bezos, would have done so already. But I'm not here to exterminate them, I'm here to improve them. And I have. I've taught them that ebooks, online marketing, and digital audiobooks are real things. And I have put enough pressure on them to clean their houses, to examine their internal hierarchies, and to jettison some particularly wasteful practices. But I, Jeff Bezos, also clearly see that we are going to have fewer great books and writers discovered in the coming years if there are fewer curators with the financial wherewithal to nurture them. And, no way around it, fewer publishing houses equals fewer curators. It's not a money thing, it's a diversity-of-perspective thing. One company -- no matter how high-minded and cleverly structured it is -- will offer fewer perspectives than many companies will. I, Jeff Bezos, was a physics student at one point and I assure you I understand principles this basic. So, starting today, I am going to deal with publishers fairly and openly. No more punishing them with delayed shipments of books we could have ordered. No more taking down of buy and pre-order buttons, knowing that Amazon can withstand the revenue dip far better than they can. Oh, and one other thing: I'm going to give new names to the Kindle and the Fire -- names that don't quite so obviously bring Fahrenheit 451 themes to the fore. And I'm going to do all this because I'm Jeff Bezos and not only am I pretty legendarily smart, but I'm pretty wise, too. Aren't I?","James Patterson: Amazon's tactics in pricing negotiations with Hatchette stirs controversy .

"Beijing (CNN) -- A large white poster dominates Liu Xiuzhi's simple room. In black Chinese script she has written the story of her decade-long struggle for justice. A story of how a simple legal dispute ended years later with Liu being branded a prostitute and thrown into solitary confinement. ""A day in that place felt like a year,"" she says. ""Ordinary people wouldn't be able to understand."" Liu's story begins, like many legal battles in China, over a property dispute with a powerful neighbor. She says that when she won a civil case against the neighbor, he sent thugs to beat her up. They left her unconscious, several teeth knocked out of her lower jaw. At first, complaints to the local police were met with indifference, she says. Then anger. So Liu started to petition. Following a centuries old tradition that started in dynastic China, Liu tried to take her grievances to local and national authorities. She says all she received was more beatings and humiliations. ""We are powerless people in China,"" she says. ""Either you have money in China and you have power or you are poor and you have none. I followed the law and I had to suffer."" Over time, her petitioning became more overtly political. She started to display signs with slogans like ""power and money rules in China"" and ""in China there is no justice and no equality."" State security took notice. They wouldn't let her leave her building during Beijing's 2008 Olympics, she says, adding that she was carefully monitored during state visits. When police caught Liu with documents for petitioning at a sports event in southern China, they finally lost their patience. Charged under a provision for ""hooliganism, prostitution, theft and fraud,"" Liu was shipped to the Xi An Re-education Through Labor Jail in southern Beijing. The re-education through labor system, or laojiao as it's known in China, began in the 1950s as a way for the fledgling Communist Party government to maintain order and stability in the chaotic post-revolution years. Half a century later, the system still allows police and other state security agents to arrest offenders for up to four years without trial. The government admits there are re-education facilities across the country and, by its own estimate, says they house tens of thousands or even more than a hundred thousand prisoners. Despite repeated requests, no officials would comment about Liu's case or about the country's re-education system. While laojiao was designed for petty thieves and prostitutes -- minor criminals that officials didn't want clogging up the courts -- rights groups believe that it is a convenient place to put government agitators. ""It is a way to silence people,"" says Amnesty International's Roseann Rife. ""It is a way to silence dissent and keep those quiet that offend the government."" Journalists, petitioners and members of the banned religious sect Falun Gong have all been put in re-education centers, says Victor Clements, a researcher for a Chinese human rights group. ""It is widely viewed as a convenient way to punish Chinese citizens who exercise constitutionally-protected civil liberties,"" he wrote in an email interview. Human rights activists and liberal Chinese intellectuals see the 10 years of Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao's leadership, while overwhelmingly positive for the nation's economy, as a lost opportunity to reform China's legal system and protect the individual rights of ordinary Chinese. Now, there is a push for reform. ""Re-education through labor is illegal,"" says Zhang Qianfan, a prominent law professor at Peking University's law school. ""The constitution should protect the basic rights of the people and if we can't implement it successfully it means the rights of the people won't be protected."" Zhang and more than a hundred other prominent academics, journalists and economists wrote and posted an open letter online earlier this year that called for incoming President Xi Jinping to ratify U.N. rights treaties and respect basic principles of human rights. Censors quickly deleted it. (Read a draft translation here.) Pressured in part by anger on social media, the government has pledged to reform the system. Recently, state media quoted officials saying it will be done by the end of 2013. However, none have elaborated on what the potential reforms could be. Many are skeptical. President Xi, while pledging to fight corruption and trim government excesses, shows few concrete signs of reforming China's legal system or allowing more public dissent. ""Even if re-education through labor is abolished, there are many other forms of administrative detention that effectively do the same thing,"" says Amnesty's Rife. Zhang, like many Chinese, sees extrajudicial prisons as a way for government officials to settle scores, silence petitioners, and muzzle critics . ""It stains our reputation. It makes China a joke. It causes a lot of tragedies for the victim, it doesn't help with our stability and security, so I believe that re-education through labor system should be abolished immediately,"" says Zhang. Liu Xiuzhi was broken by her time in Xi An prison. She says she was put in solitary confinement when she refused to admit the charges against her. She says it was a matter of principle. When she got out, after more than a year in prison, she vowed to keep fighting for justice. But she doesn't hold out much hope. ""On the television the Communist Party shows that it is taking care of everything and I really believed it. But when you encounter real trouble it's different. Whatever you say they will ignore you and punish you.""","Petitioner Liu Xiuzhi spent more than a year in one of China notorious labor camps .

"(CNN) -- Authorities have obtained an arrest warrant for Jesse Matthew, charging him with abduction with the intent to defile, in the case of missing University of Virginia student Hannah Graham, Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo told reporters Tuesday. Police believe Matthew was the last person with Graham before her disappearance. She was last seen September 13 in an area of Charlottesville known as the downtown mall. The Charlottesville Police Department is circulating a wanted poster for the 32-year-old Matthew, who is also wanted for two counts of reckless driving. He is described as an African-American man, standing 6 feet, 2 inches tall, and weighing 270 pounds. He is known to have contacts in Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington, D.C. Matthew willingly went to a police station over the weekend, along with several family members, walking through the front door and asking for a lawyer, Longo said. There was no warrant for his arrest then. Matthew and the lawyer spoke and then left, Longo said. The police chief declined to provide additional details on the case. ""Between now and the time that this matter goes to trial, we need to be very sensitive about the information that we share,"" he said. However, the chief stressed: ""We absolutely are continuing our search for Hannah."" On the evening of September 12, she was seen at a party before friends saw her at an apartment complex a couple of blocks away. That was shortly before midnight, according to a time line compiled by CNN affiliate WVIR. Hannah Graham disappearance: What we know . About 12:45 a.m. on September 13, a surveillance camera caught her outside a pub, about three-quarters of a mile from the apartment complex. A doorman turned her away at the pub, Longo said Sunday. Ten minutes later, she is seen running past a gas station -- no one appears to be pursuing her -- and witnesses say they saw her five minutes later roughly four blocks from the gas station, WVIR reported. She was at a restaurant, witnesses said. Videos offer clues in search for missing student . The surveillance camera at an Italian cafe captured her walking along the mall about 1:06 a.m. The camera at a jewelry store recorded her passing two minutes later, WVIR reported. At 1:20 a.m. she texted her friends to say was lost and trying to find a party, WVIR reported. She and a man were seen having drinks at a bar between 1:30 and 2 a.m., WVIR said. Police believe she may have been under the influence of alcohol, and may have been vulnerable or unable to defend herself. Investigators have previously searched Matthew's apartment and car. Potential evidence was sent to a lab for analysis. Jeffrey Ban, central laboratory director at the Department of Forensic Science in Richmond, Virginia, declined to say how long that work might take. ""Some cases are much quicker than others, just depends on the evidence -- depends on how much evidence we have, where the evidence is, how small the sample is,"" he said. ""The best I could tell you is that my staff, in a case like this, is very dedicated and they're doing everything they can in the quickest manner possible,"" Ban said. Authorities are offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to the safe return of Graham, 18, a second-year student at the University of Virginia. ""Hannah is beyond precious to us,"" her parents said in a statement released shortly after her disappearance. ""We are truly devastated by her disappearance. It's totally out of character for us not to have heard from her, and we fear foul play."" CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin, Stacey Samuel and Jean Casarez contributed to this report.","NEW: Potential evidence in the case has been sent to a lab for analysis .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- A deadline set by Libya's new leaders for the surrender of the towns of Sirte and Bani Walid, bastions of hardcore supporters of Moammar Gadhafi, passed at midnight Friday without any apparent deal. Before the deadline expired, a spokesman for the National Transitional Council said talks with loyalists were continuing into the evening. Absent a resolution, ""it's up to military planners to decide how to move forward,"" Shamsuddin Ben Ali said. Sticking points included the demand by Gadhafi loyalists for NTC fighters to enter their communities unarmed, and to refrain from searching houses. The loyalists also asked for blanket pardons, but the NTC wanted to prosecute loyalists with blood on their hands, Ben Ali said. Sirte is on the Mediterranean coast east of Tripoli, and Bani Walid is southeast of the capital. A military spokesman, citing heavy resistance from loyalists in Bani Walid, said anti-Gadhafi forces had retreated Friday. NTC media committee spokesman Jalal el Gallal said fighting for Sirte was taking place 55 kilometers (34 miles) east of the city. El Gallal said NTC fighters were met with small-arms fire as they advanced from the east, and a battle ensued with heavy artillery. A Benghazi hospital received a number of casualties, he said. Earlier, Abdallah Kenshill, an NTC chief negotiator, had told CNN that anti-Gadhafi fighters had been just 1.5 kilometers, nearly a mile, from the center of Bani Walid, situated on the north, east and south. Anti-Gadhafi fighters captured seven loyalists, including a brigadier general, he said, and three loyalists were killed. An anti-Gadhafi fighter was killed and four others were wounded, Kenshill said. CNN was not able to independently verify his account. Inside Bani Walid, meanwhile, pro- and anti-Gadhafi groups clashed, but NTC fighters were not involved, said Badr Abu Shahma, assistant to the commander of Misrata's southern front. Ben Ali also said he received intelligence reports that loyalist forces were moving captured NTC fighters to Qasr Bu Hadi for use as human shields. That town is 10 miles east of Sirte. Mahmoud Jibril, chairman of the NTC executive board, will visit Misrata on Saturday to survey the damage in the city, where he has tribal ties, Ben Ali said. The developments came as Interpol issued Red Notice arrest warrants Friday for Gadhafi, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court in The Hague for alleged crimes against humanity. A Red Notice allows Interpol, the international police agency, to circulate arrest warrants widely with an intention to extradite suspects to the ICC. At the United Nations, Ian Martin, the secretary-general's special envoy to Libya, told reporters that fears of a humanitarian disaster in the capital have not materialized. City infrastructure has suffered little damage, the disruption of the water supply has been largely alleviated, supplies of fuel and electricity are improving, schools are slated to reopen September 17, and there has been no general breakdown of public order, said Martin, who had earlier briefed the Security Council after his return from five days in Libya. ""That's quite a striking conflict with other post-conflict"" cities, he said. But those advances do not minimize the enormous challenges that transitional authorities still face. A Supreme Security Committee has been established in Tripoli to bring all armed elements under a single command, but ""the proliferation of weapons is a major concern, including to Libya's neighbors,"" Martin said. ""The approach they're taking is to, at this stage, tell the very top echelon of the military, the police, the civil service, to remain at home while decisions are taken as to which of them should or should not be part of the future,"" he said. Despite appeals by NTC leaders, acts of revenge have been carried out, ""especially of sub-Saharan Africans accused -- often, I think, quite wrongly -- of having fought for the Gadhafi regime,"" he said. In addition, ""terrible evidence continues to come to light of the deliberate human rights abuses and crimes of the Gadhafi regime, both those that took place over many years and during the fall of Tripoli, when many of the prisoners were massacred,"" Martin said. ""This is going to be a very heavy burden for Libya's new leaders as they seek to show that there will be accountability within the law for the worst violations, but at the same time promote national reconciliation."" The weight of that burden was underscored by a report by Human Rights Watch that 18 bodies were discovered Thursday in western Libya. The find corroborates reports by two survivors that the dead had been detainees held by Gadhafi forces in the town of al-Khoms who were killed in June. The dead suffocated when they were locked inside two metal shipping containers, the group said. A captured Gadhafi soldier led officials from the military council of al-Khoms, about 120 kilometers (75 miles) east of Tripoli, to the bodies, which were buried between Bani Walid and Orban, HRW said. ""The Gadhafi forces threw detainees in metal containers with little water and air on a brutally hot day, and refused to let them out despite cries for help,"" said Fred Abrahams, special adviser at Human Rights Watch. A 19th person died a few days later, so was not buried with the other 18, the group said. A video that appears to have been shot by a Gadhafi soldier shows several of the detainees -- blindfolded and bound -- being kicked and whipped inside the container. Meanwhile, an interim government is to be established within 30 days of the declaration of liberation, U.N. envoy Martin said. Until then, the NTC is assuming ""caretaker responsibilities"" to carry out urgently needed functions, he added. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has proposed a support mission for three months, after which ""we would then go back to the Security Council for a longer mandate,"" Martin said. CNN's Kareem Khadder, Ian Lee, Jim Bittermann and Umaro Djau contributed to this report.","18 bodies found in western Libya, Human Rights Watch reports .

"Berryville, Virginia (CNN) -- Travis and Joyce Miller might have the most fragrant garage in the Shenandoah Valley. The heady scent of hickory wood wafts from their rural home on Virginia's busy Route 7, catching the attention of hungry commuters who might expect to find a grandma tending the hearth or, even better, a pitmaster roasting a hog on the side of the road. What's cooking, though, is something a little bit sweeter (sorry, grandma): It's Falling Bark Farm hickory syrup. Never heard of hickory syrup? Neither had the Millers until a few years ago when a chance Internet search turned up mentions of it. In 2011, they showed up to the farmers market in nearby Purcellville, Virginia, with 48 bottles of their new science project -- ""which we felt was a little bit risky,"" Travis says. The risk paid off. The couple aim to sell 30,000 units this year. The Millers credit tapping into the market at the right time with all the right buzzwords: foraged, locally sourced and, most of all, unique. They're the first to admit they didn't have a divine syrup destiny; they're just retirees looking to get by via trial and error -- a challenge that Americans of all ages face regularly. ""Everybody out there is looking for something new,"" Travis says. ""The difficulty is not necessarily producing the product, it's about marketing the product."" The Millers are among a dozen or so hickory syrup producers nationwide; in comparison, the maple syrup industry produced 3.17 million gallons in 2014, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Millers have built their business by intriguing the average consumer, who often associates the flavor of syrup strictly with maple or ""pancake syrup"" poured from a character-shaped bottle. ""We say, 'You know what, if you just taste it. Just taste the hickory, we just want you to have the hickory experience. You don't have to buy it,' "" Joyce says. They find that the flavor is all it takes to win over new customers -- not to mention the loyal following of Washington-area chefs who appreciate the syrup's smoky, earthy undertones. ""We don't say it's better or worse than maple; it's just a different culinary experience,"" she says. The sugar content is similar to that of maple syrup, but the intensity of the sweetness is not there, Travis adds, which is why they suggest use in meat glazes or even cocktails. As the name suggests, hickory syrup is made from the bark of hickory trees -- shagbark hickory, to be exact. Instead of boiling down tapped tree sap like maple or birch syrup makers would, the Millers craft their product by extracting flavors from the actual bark that's been foraged from the forest floor. They scrub the bark clean, roast it over an open flame and then boil it with turbinado sugar to form a syrup. Throughout the Millers' 33-year marriage, the couple have always looked to their hands -- and the land around them -- as a means of making a living. They grow and eat their own produce, hunt and cook their own game, and have even built most of their houses from the ground up. Joyce says the initial plan was that if they could work a weekend producing syrup and make the same amount of money Travis was earning at his odd retirement jobs, they'd take that idea to the next level and pursue it full time. Three years later, the notion seems to have stuck. ""I think the family that works together, stays together,"" Travis says. At first, they experimented with compound butters and smoked salts. The smoking led them to looking into different woods to smoke -- from there they branched into hickory. ""And then syrup just started happening,"" Joyce says. ""And it's continued to happen. We're going to follow it wherever it takes us."" They individually bottle each unit in their home using a Hamilton Beach coffee urn, and drive orders to the post office in their truck with a license plate that reads, ""SRP HPNS"" (syrup happens). People in their small rural community know them as the hickory syrup folks, and have started to chip in by letting the couple stop by and pick up any naturally shedding bark off their property. Oftentimes, they come home to find bundles of hickory bark on their front porch like a basket of fresh baked goods from a new neighbor. ""We just try to do the right thing,"" Joyce says. ""I guess maybe all that's karma. It's come back around and starting to pay off."" An 8-ounce bottle retails for around $9.99, and the syrup is available nationwide in retailers such as Whole Foods as well as in Falling Bark Farm's online store. ""We don't want to get too big, too fast, kind of like the cupcake industry,"" Joyce jokes. ""We're just taking it a step at a time."" Besides, it's just the two of them producing all the sticky stuff. ""We're just two simple senior citizens making syrup,"" Joyce says. For the Millers, at the moment, money really does grow on trees.","Travis and Joyce Miller started producing hickory syrup as an experiment .
Hickory syrup is similar to maple syrup, but it's smokier and less sweet in taste .
In three years, Falling Bark Farm went from selling 48 bottles of syrup a year to 30,000 ."
"(CNN) -- Malaysian police have charged two people over the alleged theft of around $35,000 (110,600 Malaysian ringgits) from the bank accounts of four passengers on missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370. HSBC bank officer Nur Shila Kanan, 33, is facing 12 charges after allegedly transferring money between the passengers' accounts, Assistant Commissioner Izany Abdul Ghany of the Kuala Lumpur Commercial Crime Investigation Department told CNN. Nur Shila's husband, Basheer Ahmad Maula Sahul Hameed, a 33-year-old mechanic, is facing four counts of allegedly using a debit and other cards belonging to one of the passengers to withdraw money from an ATM. Funds were also allegedly transferred to a fifth account belonging to Pakistani man Ali Faran Khan, who is still being sought by police. Officers detained Nur Shila and her husband last Thursday after being alerted to the suspected fraud by HSBC bank officials in Malaysia. Both defendants have pleaded not guilty. They've been released on bail and ordered to surrender their passports. According to state news agency Bernama, their next hearing is on August 25. The allegations . It's alleged that between May 14 and July 8, Nur Shila transferred $12,600 (40,000 ringgits) from the account of Malaysian passenger Hue Pui Heng to the account of Chinese passenger Tian Jun Wei, according to Bernama. The bank officer is accused of then using fake documents to apply for a new debit card in Tian's name, and making applications to transfer money from savings accounts belonging to Chinese passengers Ju Kun and Malaysian flight attendant Tan Size Hiang, Bernama said. The first of the alleged offenses was committed two months after flight MH370 disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Extensive land and sea searches have failed to find any sign of the Boeing 777-200ER, which was carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew. Officials believe the plane crashed into the southern Indian Ocean, west of Australia, while on autopilot. New attempts to find the plane are expected to start in September. Australian officials have appointed Dutch company Fugro Survey to conduct the search. The company will use two ships equipped with towed deep-water vehicles, as well as side-scan sonar, multibeam echo sounders and video cameras, to search an area of 60,000 square kilometers (23,000 square miles) and depths of up to 7,000 meters (four miles).

"(CNN) -- The 45 U.N. peacekeepers seized in the Golan Heights have been freed and are in good condition, the United Nations said Thursday. The peacekeepers -- all from Fiji -- were captured two weeks ago by the al-Nusra Front, an al Qaeda affiliate, in the buffer zone between Syria and the Israeli-occupied territory. The personnel were handed over to the U.N. Disengagement Observer Force. A spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said discussions had been ongoing with captors by ""various parties"" at ""various levels"" to obtain the peacekeepers' release. The U.N. Disengagement Observer Force has overseen a buffer zone in the Golan Heights since 1974 to maintain a ceasefire between Israel and Syria. Fighting from Syria's civil war spilled over into the buffer zone last week. Al-Nusra Front used civilian cars to take the peacekeepers to a U.N. base on the Syrian side of the border, a CNN source said, and the troops walked about 200 meters to the Israeli-occupied Golan side. U.N. vehicles then took the troops to the U.N. observer force command center, the source said. Ban's spokesman said the secretary-general ""appreciates the efforts of all concerned to secure their safe release."" ""The Secretary-General emphasizes to all parties the impartiality of United Nations peacekeepers,"" the spokesman said. ""The Secretary-General demands that all parties respect UNDOF's mandate, freedom of movement and the safety and security of its personnel."" Fiji's prime minister described the peacekeepers as heroes in a statement Friday. ""They kept their cool and showed restraint under the most extreme circumstances imaginable. Because of their discipline, not one militant was killed and none of our soldiers were harmed,"" Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama said in a statement. The peacekeepers will be debriefed, he said, and ""obviously deserve a period of rest before they return to their duties."" Bainimarama also praised the courage of the peacekeepers' families. ""They were naturally distressed and anxious during this difficult time, but they never once questioned why their loved ones were sent to the Golan Heights in the first place,"" he said. ""They know better than anyone else that our mission is to bring peace and security to people living in troubled areas around the world.""

"(CNN) -- American journalist James Foley was beheaded by his ISIS captors to send a message to the Western world. And he is not the only Westerner held by the militant group. The video of his execution, posted to YouTube, shows another U.S. journalist, identified as Steven Sotloff. The ISIS fighter makes it clear the captive's fate hangs in the balance -- he will be killed, ISIS said, if the United States does not end its military operations in Iraq. Thousands of Syrians and Iraqis have been slain by ISIS militants as the Sunni extremist group seeks to build an Islamic caliphate stretching across a swath of territory. But the execution of Western captives holds greater shock value outside the region's borders -- and represents a powerful propaganda tool. Alternatively, those hostages, often journalists or aid workers, can be a useful tool if kept alive: either freed for hefty ransoms, used as bargaining chips for the militants' ends or sold on to other extremist groups. It's hard to know how many captives there are because governments, employers and families tend to keep kidnappings quiet for fear of putting the victims in greater danger while negotiators work to secure their release. But ISIS is believed to be holding a number of Americans, including Sotloff, a U.S. official told CNN on Wednesday. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, declined to identify them or say exactly how many Americans are being held. Missing journalists . The Committee to Protect Journalists estimates that about 20 journalists are missing in Syria -- most of them local, some from outside Syria. It says many of them are believed to be held by ISIS. Among them is American Austin Tice, a freelance journalist who was contributing articles to The Washington Post. Tice disappeared in Syria in August 2012. There has been no word of or from him since his abduction. More than 80 journalists have been abducted in Syria, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists -- a number the organization says is unprecedented in the three decades since it was founded. Some have been freed, others killed. Often a media blackout on journalists' abductions is lifted only in best- and worst-case scenarios. It emerged this week that U.S. special operations units were sent into Syria this summer to rescue Foley and other hostages -- but their mission proved unsuccessful. Richard Byrne, a spokesman for the news website GlobalPost, also revealed that ISIS had demanded a ransom of 100 million euros (about $132 million) for Foley's release. The journalist freelanced for GlobalPost and other news organizations. 'They are innocents' Foley's mother, Diane, expressed concern for other hostages on the Free James Foley Facebook page. ""We implore the kidnappers to spare the lives of the remaining hostages. Like Jim, they are innocents. They have no control over American government policy in Iraq, Syria or anywhere in the world,"" she wrote. Fears for the safety of Westerners held by Islamist militants have also highlighted the different approaches taken by governments when it comes to kidnappings. The UK government has a hard-line policy of never paying ransoms. The U.S. government also does not negotiate with terrorists. At the same time, other European governments in the past are thought to have handed over cash to terror groups to ensure the release of nationals. The United States, as in the case with the thwarted Foley mission, has in the past attempted hostage rescues. Sometimes these can work out, as happened in 2012 when Navy SEALs rescued U.S. aid worker Jessica Buchanan and fellow aid worker Poul Thisted of Denmark after three months' captivity in Somalia. They had been abducted while traveling there for the Danish Refugee Council. But sometimes such attempts fail. Linda Norgrove, a kidnapped British aid worker, was accidentally killed by a U.S. grenade during a SEAL rescue bid in Afghanistan in 2010. Tortured, beaten in captivity . While negotiations for potential releases continue, little or nothing is made public about the hostages' plight. But slowly details are emerging of the experiences endured by Foley following his abduction while on a reporting trip in northern Syria in November 2012. A source who says he was held last year with Foley told CNN's Bharati Naik that he, Foley and another journalist were held from March to August 2013 in a prison in Aleppo, Syria. At the time, the source -- who spoke on condition of anonymity -- said they were being held by the Nusra Front, a Syrian rebel group with al Qaeda ties. At one point, according to the source, there were nearly 100 people -- including European journalists -- in the prison. The source says Foley and the other journalist, who was not Sotloff, were transferred to an ISIS training camp. Foley and the other journalist, according to the source, were tortured in prison -- mostly beaten. 'Foley had to endure more' French journalist Nicolas Henin, who was taken hostage in June 2013 with French photographer Pierre Torres, told CNN that he also had been held with Foley in northern Syria before his release this year. ""We spent seven months together out of the 10 months that I was held in captivity. Most of the time our condition was OK -- but at the beginning and end of our time, we were not treated very well,"" he said, speaking from Paris. ""Foley especially had to endure more because he was American. He was missing his family and would talk often about them."" Foley said he had been initially kidnapped by jihadists fighting in Syria, Henin told France Info radio. That group eventually became part of the ISIS movement. Henin and Torres were released along with two other French journalists, Didier FranÃ§ois and Edouard Elias, on April 19. It's not known what went on behind the scenes to secure their freedom, but French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius insisted that France had not paid a ransom, Radio France Internationale reported at the time. Other Westerners held in Syria also have been released in recent months. Two Spanish journalists held for more than six months in Syria, El Mundo staff correspondent Javier Espinosa and freelance photographer Ricardo Garcia Vilanova, were freed in March. At the time of their capture, El Mundo said the journalists' captors were reported to be members of a group linked to ISIS. And a Danish photographer, Daniel Rye Ottosen, was freed in June, the Danish Foreign Ministry said, having been held captive in Syria since May 2013. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter, Nic Robertson, Barbara Starr and Allison Brennan contributed to this report.","ISIS has other Western hostages, including journalist identified as Steven Sotloff .

"(CNN) -- Three Afghan National Army officers -- guests of the U.S. military at a training exercise in Massachusetts -- disappeared on Saturday and reappeared Monday in the custody of Canadian border guards. The men are in custody at the Rainbow Bridge, a checkpoint on the border at Niagara Falls, and are being interviewed by federal authorities, Massachusetts State Police David Procopio said. The military, State Department and other government agencies are remaining especially quiet about the choice the three Afghan officers made to go off the radar. Maj. Jan Mohammad Arash, Cpt. Mohammad Nasir Askarzada and Cpt. Noorullah Aminyar went missing Saturday after a trip to a mall. The three were reported missing by base security late Saturday and were last seen at a Cape Cod mall in Hyannis. Authorities said they posed no threat to the public. Shelbe Benson-Fuller, regional press officer at U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said the agency was notified by the Canadian Border Services Agency when the men were taken into custody. Canadian officials declined to confirm if the three officers were seeking asylum. Arash, Askarzada and Aminyar arrived in the United States on September 11 for the annual Exercise Regional Cooperation and were quartered at Joint Base Cape Cod, the Massachusetts National Guard said. Their disappearance comes in the wake of an incident earlier this month when two Afghan police officers training with the DEA went missing for six days. Mohd Naweed Samimi, 24, and Mohammad Yasin Ataye, 22, were training in Quantico, Virginia, and went missing on September 13. They were later found on September 18 in Buffalo, New York, according to DEA spokesman Rusty Payne. The men, who Payne said were monitored by escorts at all times, never posed any threat or danger. They wanted to stay in the United States, but authorities found them and sent them home. In both cases, the Afghan attendees at the training sessions were cleared and given visas by the State Department. A source familiar with the process told CNN that officers are usually handpicked and vetted, including a complete background check, possible polygraph and interviews to determine whether they are a flight risk. The source says that the three officers did not break the law. The Massachusetts State Police concurred. The Exercise Regional Cooperation, in which the three soldiers training in Cape Cod were participating, included troops from six nations. Despite their disappearance, the guard said the exercise has continued. The purpose of the exercise is to train participating nations in ""stability operations"" and ""operations conducted during United Nations mandated peacekeeping operations,"" according to the guard. Roughly a dozen Afghan soldiers are still participating. The Regional Cooperation exercise has been conducted annually since 2004, according to the Massachusetts National Guard. Tajikistan is the lead nation for conducting the exercise this year. The last exercise was held in 2013 and led by the Republic of Kazakhstan's Ministry of Defense. Gen. Zahir Azimi, a spokesman for the Afghan Defense Ministry, told CNN that the ministry is investigating both incidents. CNN's Dave Alsup and Mary Kay Mallonee contributed to this report.","NEW: The three missing Afghan officers are in custody at U.S.-Canada border .

"(Mashable) -- The rumor that Facebook will suddenly start charging users to access the site has become one of the social media era's perennial chain letters. While Facebook prominently advertises that its service is ""free and always will be"" on its homepage, it hasn't stopped false rumors of a pay scheme from going viral on numerous occasions, most recently in conjunction with the major profile redesign that the site announced earlier this month. Given the ubiquity of these rumors, we thought it was worth exploring their origin -- and why we can guarantee Facebook will never charge you to use its service. A long history . Chain letters -- which date back to the days of snail mail -- have dogged nearly every online service that achieved critical mass. While they vary in the details, the general premise is that something negative will happen to your account unless you spread the message to your friends. On AIM, this took the form of IMs that needed to be shared with friends to avoid account deletion. On Friendster, rumors spread that the service was getting ""too crowded"" -- and hence, they needed to determine which accounts were active and remove those that weren't. On MySpace, word was that the service was getting so popular that the site would soon start charging members, and the only way to avoid the fees was to -- you guessed it -- forward the message to your friends. Of course, none of these situations ever actually materialized, but it didn't stop millions of users from passing the message along. Snopes has a detailed overview of these scams and others that have permeated the web over the years, going all the way back to the early days of Hotmail. Facebook's business model . The recent round of Facebook rumors suggest that the site will start charging for membership as a result of the upcoming new profiles. The new Facebook does indeed feature some dramatic changes, but you can rest assured that one of them isn't that the site will start charging you. Here's why: For starters, it doesn't need the money. Facebook is estimated to be on track to pull in around $4 billion in revenue in 2011, and has raised more than $2 billion in venture capital. It's also on track to go public in 2012, a move that would bring in significantly more capital for the company and value it at between $80 billion and $100 billion. More importantly, the company's business model revolves around having as many users as possible. Remaining free is paramount to doing that. Facebook makes its money on highly targeted advertising that's based on the plethora of data that its members share on the site. Restricting users' ability to use the site would actually be detrimental to that model. Facebook didn't even introduce its ad platform until 2007 -- because the company wanted to focus on adding users as quickly as possible. That's not to say social networking sites haven't found success in charging members for some services. LinkedIn offers premium memberships with features such as enhanced search, direct messaging and seeing who has viewed your profile. Some dating sites, like Match.com and eHarmony charge users to message each other. Still, those services are appealing to a specific audience -- Facebook's goal is to connect everyone in the world. That can't be done if you need a credit card to use the service. Why it will never charge you . Of course, Facebook is in business to make money. Beyond advertising, it has found ways to profit directly from its users through Facebook Credits, a form of currency that can be used on the site in social games like FarmVille and Mafia Wars. In the future, we expect Facebook to find additional ways to monetize. The company could grow its credit system to become a rival to PayPal. We could also see Facebook extending its ad platform beyond the social network itself and onto the wider Web -- in order to compete with Google's AdSense. There's also potential in e-commerce. Although Facebook's Deals product fell flat, an increasing number of merchants are starting to sell their wares directly on the social networking site. Might Facebook one day provide its own tools for powering such activity? It's certainly possible. The one thing that all of these models have in common is that they need a critical mass of users to be successful. Facebook has that, and would never risk losing it by charging people for basic access to the tools that make its multi-billion dollar business work.

"(CNN) -- Welcome to ""The Voice's"" swiveling chairs, Gwen Stefani and Pharrell Williams. Season seven of NBC's vocal competition kicked off Monday night, with Stefani and Williams as two of the series' newest judges. Mainstays Adam Levine and Blake Shelton, the anchors of ""The Voice"" as other stars like Christina Aguilera, CeeLo Green, Usher and Shakira have cycled through the judges' panel, made sure to make them feel right at home during the premiere. In the words of Williams, ""This is going to be fun."" In case you've forgotten how ""The Voice"" works, four judges go through rounds of blind auditions to build up teams of singers, whom the judges will then put through their paces until America crowns one of the contestants ""The Voice."" Stefani can rely on her prowess as a multitalented entertainer -- she's been a success as both part of a group and a solo artist, not to mention her fashion and beauty brands -- to woo vocal contenders over to her side. Her strategy worked well Monday, with Stefani able to grab Taylor John Williams, whose rendition of ""Heartless"" caught both her and Levine's attention, and ""Problem"" singer Bryana Salaz for her team. Pharrell Williams has his experience as a powerhouse producer on his side and pulled two of the night's best performers, Luke Wade and Elyjuh Rene, into his group. Shelton and Levine were not to be outdone. Levine landed young talent Clara Hong and Transportation Security Administration employee Damien, whose ""It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday"" got all four judges to spin around in their chairs. Shelton, meanwhile, brought previous contestant Allison Bray into his fold, along with crooner James David Carter, whose ""Nobody Knows"" had all the judges angling to work with him.

"(CNN) -- A California lawyer is facing license suspension for alleged deceptive advertising by Photoshopping herself into cozy pictures with politicians and celebrities on her official website. The California State Bar Court is recommending Svitlana Sangary be suspended from practicing law for six months, after an investigation showed her website featured fake publicity photos of her next to President Barack Obama, former President Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Arnold Schwarzenegger, George Clooney, Kim Kardashian, Ellen DeGeneres and others. The California Bar Association says Sangary's suspension does not go into effect until approved by the California Supreme Court and is recommending two-and-a-half years of probation after the six-month suspension. On Friday, CNN contacted Sangary for comment, and she said she would call back shortly. ""I will tell you much more later,"" she said. Later in the day, she declined additional immediate comment. She ultimately responded in a lengthy email Monday that defended her position, but did not flatly deny doctoring the photos. Misleading the public . Sangary faked many or all of the photos by taking original celebrity pictures and then overlaying her own image, the state bar court found. The ruling said because the ""photographs were part of an advertisement and solicitation for future work ... they were false, deceptive, and intended to confuse, deceive and mislead the public."" But high-profile legal analyst and celebrity lawyer Mark Geragos does not think an attorney's photoshop frenzy is troublesome or worth suspension. ""If that kind of puffery is actionable by the state bar, you are going to put the entire membership of state bar out of business,"" Geragos told CNN. ""There is no greater group of self-promoters than lawyers, and puffery goes with the territory."" Court documents say Sangary answered her notice of disciplinary charges with a ""16-page soliloquy with little to no rational connection to the charges."" A ""sweet sixteen"" response . As an example, court papers cited a portion of Sangary's response, which she wrote referring to herself in the third person: ""There is a popular expression, 'sweet sixteen'. The foregoing 16 pages can be characterized as bitter-sweet sixteen, in Sangary's view. It goes without saying as to why they are bitter. Can one envision the acts in the civil arena, more unseemly than the ones described above? ""Svitlana Sangary came to this country in her twenties, with nothing, and married another immigrant, who also had nothing ... Sangary's American dream has come true, as she has been able to achieve a point wherein now, in her thirties, Sangary is a prominent donor and philanthropist, supporting important social causes, who had recently received the email from President Obama, with the subject line 'I need your help today', asking Svitlana Sangary for an additional donation."" Sangary made similar statements in her Monday response to CNN saying the pictures ""represent the doors that an underdog, an immigrant woman can walk through, and the heights the first generation American can climb."" ""I put blood, sweat and tears to finally reach a point in my life when I became a major donor and devoted supporter of numerous charitable and political causes, and got invited to the events where I was blessed with the opportunity to socialize and have my pictures taken with the talented and successful people, who have been inspiring me for my whole life, whom I admire and look up to."" Sangary added: ""Please take a look at all my pictures, consult any computer guru if you like, and decide for yourself whether these pictures are real, authentic or Photoshopped."" Culpable of four counts . Stan Goldman, a Loyola Law School of Los Angeles professor with a background in legal ethics, argues lawyers' websites and photoshopping should be controlled by the state bar so that clients can make rational choices. ""You may not be misrepresenting law school, grades or experience, but this (attorney's website) is untrue,"" Goldman said. ""It's suggesting you are more well-connected, more important, more successful and talented than you are."" State Bar Court Judge Donald F. Miles found Sangary culpable of four total counts: deceptive advertising, two counts of failing to cooperate with a disciplinary investigation, and one count of failing to promptly release a client file. Sangary's website says she's a Pepperdine Law School graduate and her offices ""concentrate on trial practice and civil litigation, specializing in all types of litigation and dispute resolution in various forums."" CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","Svitlana Sangary faked photos of herself with celebs and politician, state bar court says .

"(CNN) -- With Fox's ""Gotham,"" we have the chance to see Batman begin once more. The much-hyped fall series made its debut on Monday night, starting off with a storyline that's pretty familiar to Batman fans and non-fans alike: the death of Bruce Wayne's parents. ""Gotham's"" take on the scene was more violent than usual, but it also added a new twist. A young Selina Kyle (played by Camren Bicondova, and destined to become Catwoman) also witnessed the young couple being gunned down. Monday's premiere did give screen time to a young Bruce (David Mazouz) as he grieved the loss of his parents, but the future superhero isn't the real star of the show. That title belongs to Detective Jim Gordon, who's not yet a commissioner, as played by ""The OC"" and ""Southland"" star Ben McKenzie. Gordon arrives in Gotham City because it's where the action is, but he soon finds out that things are far more complicated. Crime bosses Fish Mooney (Jada Pinkett-Smith) and Carmine Falcone run the city's underworld, and Gordon's partner, Harvey Bullock, isn't exactly the most ethical cop around. But compared to McKenzie's straight-as-an-arrow Gordon, the villains are so far the best part of ""Gotham."" Fish and her lackey Oswald Cobblepot -- who's also called by the nickname he hates,""Penguin"" -- were a treat to watch, as were the younger versions of Gotham bad guys Riddler and Poison Ivy during their very brief introductions. Thus far, McKenzie's Gordon seems like a one-note, righteous character, so we'll have to see if he gets fleshed out in future episodes. For critics, ""Gotham"" had a nice start but doubtful longevity. ""Taken strictly on its own terms, the Fox series is a handsome, gritty crime drama, with Ben McKenzie as the idealistic young cop and Donal Logue as his grizzled, ethically compromised partner,"" Brian Lowry said in Variety's review. ""Yet if the show is supposed to work for its peripheral connection to the Dark Knight and his colorful menagerie of villains before they became such ... well, that bat simply won't fly."" Mike Hale at the New York Times tried to focus on the positive, pointing out that at the very least, ""Gotham"" has ""consistent style."" ""If you're going to make yet another show or movie about an honest cop in a corrupt city,"" Hale said, ""you'd better make it look good. (A)nd this Gotham City, with its nightmarish gothic skyline under perpetually gray skies, looks pretty good."" Viewers on Twitter had mostly positive responses to the show -- and particularly its casting -- although not everyone was immediately sold. ""Amazing cast. I was impressed because this isn't the type of show I would watch in the past,"" said KE Vargas Barrett. Added another fan, ""I like the look and style. Characters known and unknown seem interesting. Glad Gordon was the focus. We'll see how it goes."" Marcus Alan Sheperd, however, ""was disappointed,"" he tweeted. ""Good thing I follow a 3 episode rule."" What did you think of the premiere?

"(CNN) -- Forty years after a Massachusetts woman was fatally stabbed, DNA evidence has led to the arrest of a suspect. Eileen Ferro was 21 when she was stabbed to death in her home on Ladyslipper Drive in Shrewsbury, according to a local newspaper account. On Tuesday, almost four decades to the day of her death, a Georgia man was arrested and charged with murder. A DNA match, officials said, turned the cold case into an active prosecution. The suspect is Lonzo Guthrie, 69, of Austell, Georgia. Guthrie was a furniture deliveryman who had a job at Ferro's home the day before she was stabbed, Worcester County, Massachusetts, District Attorney Joe Early Jr. said. He was never on investigators' radar at the time of the killing, Early said. Two seemingly unrelated events led to the DNA match, he said. Now-dead convict likely linked to Florida woman's '89 disappearance . In Massachusetts, investigators resubmitted evidence from the 1974 crime scene to a lab to re-evaluate it for any traces of DNA. Separately, Guthrie violated parole for a crime he committed in Los Angeles and was required to provide a DNA sample, Early said. These two sources of DNA provided the break that had eluded investigators for years, he said. Douglas County, Georgia, authorities arrested Guthrie without incident following questioning by Massachusetts State Police officers, Douglas sheriff's Sgt. John Sweat said. Guthrie was being held without bond and was fighting extradition to Massachusetts, Sweat said. Douglas County deputies began keeping an eye on Guthrie after Massachusetts officers contacted them in November. Guthrie wasn't unknown to authorities in Douglas. Guthrie is a registered sex offender stemming from a rape conviction in California, also in 1974. He'd also been arrested for driving with a suspended license, Sweat said. Most recently, Guthrie, who sometimes used the alias Norman James, occasionally worked in a business called Norman's Road Service Repair, Sweat said. Taken: The coldest case ever solved .

"(CNN) -- They were 31 characters read, and retweeted, around the world. If any doubts lingered over Twitter's capacity to break news first, the overnight raids launched by U.S. forces on Syria on Tuesday night offered another case study of what the microblogging site does best. Well before the first media accounts of the attack on the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa, Abdulkader Hariri, a Twitter user in the town, tweeted this: . ""Breaking: Huge explosions shook the city in what might be the beginning of US airstrikes on ISIS HQs in Raqqa"" Hariri is believed to be the first person to report on the first strikes the United States carried out against ISIS inside Syria. He posted his tweet shortly after 9 p.m. -- almost 30 minutes before Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby announced the operation to the world. ""US military & partner nation forces have begun striking ISIL targets in Syria using mix of fighters, bombers and Tomahawk missiles."" In this respect, Hariri's tweet recalls the U.S. raid on Abbottabad in Pakistan in May 2011 in which Osama bin Laden was killed -- and one Twitter user unknowingly reported details. Some of the first public accounts of the military operation that killed the terrorist leader came in the form of tweets from Sohaib Athar, a 33-year-old IT consultant. ""Helicopter hovering above Abbottabad at 1AM (is a rare event),"" the tweet said. CNN tried to reach Hariri early Wednesday morning, but was unsuccessful. In several subsequent posts, he live-tweeted the operation.","Twitter user Abdulkader Hariri in Raqqa is way ahead of the media as operation starts .

"Orlando, Florida (CNN) -- A whale trainer at SeaWorld died from ""multiple traumatic injuries and drowning"" after a 12,000-pound killer whale grabbed her ponytail and pulled her underwater in front of shocked onlookers at Shamu Stadium, the Orange County Sheriff's office said Thursday. Dawn Brancheau, 40, was ""pulled underwater for an extended period of time,"" by the whale, Chuck Tompkins, SeaWorld's curator of zoological operations, told CNN's ""American Morning."" The county medical examiner ruled Brancheau ""most likely died from multiple traumatic injuries and drowning after one of the park's killer whales pulled her into a pool behind Shamu Stadium,"" the sheriff's office said in a statement. The statement confirms Tompkins' account, saying that Brancheau was interacting with the whale, named Tilikum, in knee-deep water ""when the animal grabbed her by the hair, said to be in a long ponytail, and pulled her underwater."" Rescuers were not immediately able to reach Brancheau because of the ""whale's aggressive nature,"" the sheriff's office said. She was recovered by SeaWorld staff members after Tilikum was coaxed into a smaller pool and lifted out of the water by a large platform on the bottom of the smaller tank, authorities said. WESH: Watch tourist's video seconds before whale attack . ""While this incident remains the subject of an ongoing death investigation, there are no signs of foul play,"" the sheriff's statement said. ""All evidence and witness statements indicate that the death was a tragic accident."" Earlier accounts varied on how Brancheau ended up in the tank. A witness told CNN affiliate WKMG-TV that the whale approached the glass side of the 35-foot-deep tank at Shamu Stadium, jumped up and grabbed Brancheau by her waist, shaking her so violently that her shoe came off. A SeaWorld employee, who asked not to be identified, described the incident the same way. Orange County Sheriff's Office spokesman Jim Solomons said Brancheau slipped into the tank. Tilikum has been linked to two other deaths. He and two other whales were involved in the drowning of a trainer at a Victoria, British Columbia, marine park in 1991. The trainer fell into the whale tank at the Sea Land Marine Park Victoria and was dragged underwater as park visitors watched. In 1999, Tilikum was blamed for the death of a 27-year-old man whose body was found floating in a tank at SeaWorld, the apparent victim of a whale's ""horseplay,"" authorities said then. The Orange County Sheriff's Office said the man apparently hid in the park until after it closed, then climbed into the tank. The 22-foot-long whale was ""not accustomed to people being in his tank"" and ""wouldn't have realized he was dealing with a very fragile human being,"" Solomons said at the time. iReport: Photo taken moments before Sea World incident . Because of Tilikum's history, as well as his size, trainers did not get into the water with him, Tompkins told CNN. Specific procedures were in place for working with him, he said, although ""obviously, we need to evaluate those protocols."" ""He's just a really, really large animal,"" Tompkins said, noting that female killer whales weigh 6,000 pounds -- half of Tilikum's weight. ""Just because of his size alone, it would be dangerous to get in the water with him."" But the whale's previous incidents were also taken into account, he said. Tompkins pointed out that the 1991 incident occurred before SeaWorld owned Tilikum and that no one is sure what took place in the incident eight years later. Tilikum could have been trying to play with Brancheau or get her attention or companionship, said Nancy Black, a marine biologist who has studied whales for 20 years. Such whales play with seals and sea lions in the wild, tossing them in the air, she said. But they do not kill them and end up letting them go. ""I don't believe the killer whale purposely intended to kill the woman,"" she said. ""It was more likely an accident, I would guess."" But, she said, the whale could also have been frustrated for some reason. Tompkins said there were no indications of any problem with Tilikum or any other animal just before the incident, and that Brancheau ""had done a great session with him ... he seemed to enjoy what he was doing at the time."" The incident, however, raises larger questions regarding the captivity of wild animals. A spokesman for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals called the death ""a tragedy that didn't have to happen."" Jaime Zalac said the organization had called on SeaWorld ""to stop confining oceangoing mammals to an area that to them is like the size of a bathtub, and we have also been asking the park to stop forcing the animals to perform silly tricks over and over again. It's not surprising when these huge, smart animals lash out."" Black told CNN that killer whales in the wild live in family groups, and males stay with their mothers their entire lives. Family members rely on each other for social structure and play, and they cover hundreds of miles of ocean, she said. ""I think they do need more space, and situations like that do cause a lot of stress for them, most likely."" She said Tilikum had a ""flopped fin,"" something seen in captivity but not much in the wild. But Tompkins said, ""We have a tremendous track record with these animals at SeaWorld"" and a very small percentage of problems. It's useful to have animals in the park, he said, because it gives scientists a chance to study them and gives members of the public an opportunity to see them and learn about them. ""This is the first time in 46 years that we've ever had an incident like this with a trainer,"" he said. Although Tilikum is large and has to be handled carefully, ""to mark him as a killer is unfair."" In 2006, a trainer at the adventure park was hospitalized after a killer whale grabbed him and twice held him underwater during a show at Shamu Stadium. CNN's John Couwels and Brian Todd contributed to this report.","Whale shows canceled Thursday at SeaWorld .

"(CNN) -- It was obvious that Baltimore Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti didn't like his organization's integrity being questioned. On Monday, he sat down (didn't use a lectern) to talk with sports reporters about last week's ESPN report that implied the Ravens' top brass knew early on how bad the Ray Rice domestic violence case was and the team tried to influence Roger Goodell to give the running back a light penalty. While denying that was the case, Bisciotti did admit again that he and the team should have done more to get the video that led to Rice being axed by his Ravens and suspended by the NFL. Bisciotti spoke for 47 minutes, at one point telling a media relations person who wanted to end the news conference that it was OK to keep going. Here are five key points we learned from the owner's candid discussion and the letter to fans that the Ravens issued tackling 15 points from the ESPN report that it disputed. Who were the sources for the story? Bisciotti told reporters that he believed Ray Rice's people were most of the unnamed sources for the story as part of their attempt to get his indefinite suspension overturned. ""Almost everything in (the article) is anonymous but it's clear from the subject matter it's Ray's attorney, Ray's agent and Ray's friends. They are building a case for reinstatement and the best way to build a case for reinstatement is to make everyone else look like they're lying."" The Ravens owner said he wished the reporters for ESPN -- which issued a statement: ""We stand by our reporting"" -- had acknowledged to readers how big a role Rice's camp played in the story. In its report it said: ""'Outside the Lines' interviewed more than 20 sources ... team officials, current and former league officials, NFL Players Association representatives and associates, advisers and friends of Rice."" Bisciotti claimed some of those friends ""started making things up."" ESPN investigative reporter Don Van Natta appeared on ""Outside the Lines"" after Bisciotti made his claims and said they were false. ""It's an assumption he's making ... but it's unfortunately just not true,"" he said. When did the Ravens know what was on the in-elevator video? It's the damning piece of evidence that got Rice fired and suspended indefinitely. He is appealing through the players' union. The video from inside the elevator at a New Jersey casino shows Ray Rice in the early morning hours of February 15 knocking out his future wife with a vicious punch to the head. TMZ Sports posted what it says was a cleaned up version of the recording. ESPN reported that Ravens Director of Security Darren Sanders knew within hours of the incident what was on the video, through a report given to him by a police officer in Atlantic City. This conflicts with what the Ravens have said about when they knew what was on the video. Through the team's statement, Sanders said it was 10 days later when a police official described the video. ""The officer could not tell from the video whether Ray slapped or punched her, but Ray told me very clearly that he did not punch her,"" Sanders said, without elaborating when Rice described the incident to him. The Ravens stopped pursuing the video when the charge against Rice was elevated from a misdemeanor to a felony. Bisciotti said it was a mistake to defer to prosecutors investigating the case and that at some point the Ravens should have demanded the video from Rice's attorney. What did Ray say happened? It's a key point of contention. ESPN cited sources in this report and another that Rice told the Ravens and NFL officials that he punched Janay Palmer, his fiancee whom he married a month after the incident. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has said his original two-game suspension of Rice was in part based on the player's misleading testimony during a June meeting. The Ravens also said Rice wasn't forthcoming. ""It was our understanding based on Ray's account that in the course of a physical altercation between the two of them he slapped Janay with an open hand, and that she hit her head against the elevator rail or wall as she fell to the ground,"" Bisciotti said in the team statement. Sanders said Rice denied punching his fiancee. Ravens General Manager Ozzie Newsome was quoted in the Baltimore Sun that the video showed that Rice didn't lie to him. He said Monday that he had only asked Rice if he had hit Palmer and Rice said he had. ""I later said Ray didn't lie to me because he told me he hit her, and that is what the video later showed -- although the video was much more violent than what I had pictured,"" he said in the Ravens' release. Did the Ravens ask prosecutors and the NFL to go easy? Team President Dick Cass said that Sanders was the only person from the team to make contact with anyone in the New Jersey judicial or law enforcement investigations. The only thing anyone from the team did outside of requesting the video was to write a letter in support of Ray Rice that was included in his application for a pretrial intervention program. Bisciotti was upset by the implication that he and Goodell are buddies who share a love for golf and that the owner used a connection to ask for a favor. ""I know and like Roger Goodell, but it is inaccurate to call us 'good friends,'"" he said in the statement. The owner said his communication with the commissioner consisted of a brief conversation at an owners' meeting. ""One time I saw Roger at the NFL meetings, and I said, 'Where are we with this?' and he said, 'Nowhere until the police investigation is concluded.' That's the extent of what I did at that time,"" Bisciotti said. Could Rice rejoin the Ravens? Yes, but not on the field, Bisciotti told reporters. He talked about text messages he sent to Rice on the day the Ravens let him go: . Hey Ray, just want to let you know, we loved you as a player, it was great having you here. Hopefully all these things are going to die down. I wish the best for you and Janay. When you're done with football, I'd like you to know you have a job waiting for you with the Ravens helping young guys getting acclimated to the league. The ESPN report indicated Rice thought the job offer was a bid to have Rice go along with the Ravens' version of events. Bisciotti said it was an honest attempt to bring back a player he thought would have a retribution story to share with young players. ""People that redeem themselves are the best ones to lead others,"" he said. ""I believed that this was Ray's one terrible moment."" Bisciotti said he believed that Rice would be a ""great asset"" counseling with rookies and telling his story of personal redemption.","Ravens owner thinks its obvious most unnamed sources were sympathetic to Ray Rice .

"(CNN) -- Maybe it's the cobwebs, the skulls and the creepy books, but somehow one gets the feeling that this is no ordinary library. In fact, it's the inner sanctum of John Constantine, a tortured exorcist condemned to hell. More accurately, it's the set of the upcoming NBC series ""Constantine,"" and it's based on the cult favorite ""Hellblazer"" comics (from DC Comics, which shares a parent company with CNN). But ""Constantine"" isn't alone: a number of upcoming new shows pull their inspiration from comics. Just as superheroes have become a cash cow for movie studios, the comic book is now the choice source material for TV. There's ""The Walking Dead,"" which premiered in 2010 and is now one of the most popular series on the small screen, and then there's ""Gotham,"" Fox's Batman prequel that debuts to high anticipation Monday. The show follows the immediate aftermath of the death of young Bruce Wayne's parents, which parallels the story of Detective Gordon (Ben McKenzie) as he struggles to fight Gotham City's underworld while maintaining his ethical beliefs. And the place is already populated with up-and-coming supervillains, including Oswald Cobblepot (the Penguin) and Selina Kyle (Catwoman). While ""Gotham"" may seem tailor-made for the hardcore Batman fan, 15-year-old actress Camren Bicondova, who fills the role of the future Catwoman, is confident all audiences will understand the show. No matter ""if you're a 'fanboy' or a newcomer, it's entertaining,"" she said. The fans will appreciate the fresh perspective, she added, while ""newcomers get to see a whole new kind of show."" Fast track to TV success? While Fox has the future Batman, The CW has ""The Flash,"" which is set to premiere on October 7. Most people are at least somewhat aware of the ""Scarlet Speedster,"" a.k.a. Barry Allen, who'll be played in this series by Grant Gustin. The previous small screen Flash, John Wesley Shipp, plays the hero's father this time around. With that awareness comes high expectations for the new title, but members of the cast say they're ready to live up to the challenge. ""Everyone who is part of this production is very aware of the love for Flash,"" said Candice Patton, who plays Barry's love interest, Iris, noting that the producers are first and foremost fans of the character. ""Our series feels and looks like the comic book in a lot of ways. The design is so incredible."" As with any adaptation, for a feature film or network series, a huge hurdle can be the way the source material is interpreted and adapted on screen. With ""The Flash,"" they've stuck close to the comic, but with its CW cousin ""Arrow,"" another comics-based series from which ""The Flash"" was spun off, there's a more unique approach. So far, with the series having enjoyed two successful seasons, the risk has worked. The trick to getting it right, says ""Arrow"" executive producer Marc Guggenheim, is having a deep love of the character. ""Comic books are an operatic medium,"" Guggenheim explained. ""That's harder to get right or produce. Unless you love comics and that world, I don't know how anyone else would do the job. So it starts with love of the character and the source material."" Jeph Loeb, Marvel's head of television, agreed that the secret to success with comic book heroes is a focus on people. ""You're invested in Peter Parker and care about what happens to Peter, so you start from there,"" he said. ""['Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s'] Agent Coulson gave his life, literally, for an agency he believed in, only to find out that agency was raft with corruption. Combine that with the extraordinary, and you have something special."" A bonafide phenomenon . With CBS' announcement Friday that it was picking up a ""Supergirl"" TV series, every major network now has a show based on comic books. (Meanwhile, cable and others continue the trend, from FX's ""The Strain"" and TNT's possible future series ""Titans"" to Netflix's ""Daredevil"" and Sony Playstation's ""Powers."") If ""Arrow"" and ""The Walking Dead"" could be considered preludes to a trend, that trend is officially in full swing. But as with much in pop culture, the superhero adoration is cyclical, mainly because it's a timeless story, said ""Arrow"" actress Emily Bett Rickards. ""It's always interesting to see a hero's struggle and hide behind an identity,"" Rickards said. Back at Constantine's inner sanctum, Constantine himself, Matt Ryan, has his own theory as to why comic characters resonate. ""It comes down to hope and heroes and people really wanting to lose themselves in a form of escapism,"" he said. ""We all want to be able to do something that we can't."" Yet aside from the natural romance of heroic storylines, there's also an economic variable. ""[Comic books] already have that built-in fanbase, (so) they're easily adaptable,"" observed Josh McDermitt, a ""Walking Dead"" fan-turned-actor on the show. ""They have stories that are already established. I don't blame all those shows for jumping on the train -- the fan base is already there and they're rabid."" Essentially, networks are launching series that have been ""field tested"" first, said ""Veronica Mars"" creator Rob Thomas, who's now executive producer of the upcoming comics-based zombie series, the CW's ""iZombie."" ""[Comic book shows] gives studios and networks a comfort level to see something succeed in another medium and see where a story might go. It's a business built on risk,"" he said. ""Anything that mitigates that risk they're eager to jump on."" Obviously, crafting a TV series from a popular comic doesn't mean an automatic sure bet. That built-in audience will go right out the window -- or to another channel -- if creators fail to deliver a product that lives up to fans' stiff standards. Thomas, for one, can admit to some ""trepidation"" of how readers of the ""iZombie"" DC Comics series will react to his screen version. ""My mom found a letter not too long ago that I wrote to Stan Lee about something I found wrong with Spider-Man,"" he said. ""At 13, I was that kid berating somebody about getting the comic book wrong. Flash forward 35 years later, and it's all karma.""","As with movies, this TV season has a heavy reliance on comics .

"(CNN) -- What do LeBron James and Bill Clinton have in common? Both were mama's boys. And contrary to popular belief, that's not a bad thing. People tend to think of mama's boys as coddled and carried and then, later on, too attached for their own good. Mama's boys are often perceived as weak; a close relationship between mother and son is viewed as suspect. And yet studies support the idea that boys who grow up having tight relationships with their mothers have a certain advantage. They become strong, independent leaders. Just look at the commander in chief. Barack Obama has gladly admitted: He was a mama's boy. But there's scientific proof that the close mother-son bond is healthy and beneficial. A 2010 study out of the University of Reading, an analysis of more than 69 studies featuring more than 6,000 children, found that kids, especially boys, who have secure attachments to their mothers tended to have fewer behavioral problems throughout their childhoods. Later on, they were expected to display fewer signs of aggression and hostility. They were, it stands to reason, more adaptable, more patient. A 2011 study published in the journal Child Development, meanwhile, found that the quality of the mother-son bond directly related to his sense of morality and his likelihood to have healthy romantic relationships, and that conflict was the biggest predictor of delinquency. And in 2012's ""The Mama's Boy Myth,"" author Kate Lombardi used her relationship with her son as a base from which to explore mother-son closeness, ultimately arguing that despite the pressure many mothers feel to let their sons learn to cope largely on their own, keeping them in a closer relationship ultimately helps boys grow into well-adjusted men. Men who grew up having close relationships with their mothers, she writes, are less inclined to argue and more inclined to ""work it out."" They have an easier time in adult relationships. In my own work, I have encountered many close mother-son relationships, particularly while researching my first book, ""Raising Boys Without Men,"" which looked at many single mothers raising boys on their own. These mothers were, perhaps not surprisingly, inclined to develop very close bonds with their sons. I followed these families for many years and came to understand that mothers, as a whole who refused to buy into the fear of being too close to their sons tended to raise boys who were more responsible, sensitive to the needs of others and more self-assured. They were more likely to have a healthy respect for women. I learned that mothers who allowed and encouraged boys to show their more emotional side helped their sons develop confidence and empathy. There is one place where a tight mother-son bond could come at a disadvantage: Once the mama's boy marries. A 2013 study by researchers at the University of Wisconsin found that mothers worry far more when their sons marry than when their daughters marry, and that these worries can turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy, leading to the man feeling jealousy, anger or sadness that, in the worst-case scenario, can destabilize his marriage. Maybe no one's surprised that mothers could feel threatened by their daughters-in-law, but it's still no reason to avoid marrying a mama's boy. A confident mama's boy, after all, is often well-equipped to navigate tricky social territory. But what about mama's girls? No one seems to bat an eyelash at the concept of close mother-daughter relationships, at least not while the daughters are small. But, in fact, ""mama's girls"" may walk a fine line between close and too close. A study published in the July issue of Social and Behavioral Sciences found that relationships between mothers and daughters that could be described as ""connected"" helped foster better self-esteem than those relationships that could be described as something closer to ""interdependent."" That is, sharing and caring works; smothering does not. A study out of the University of Georgia, for instance, also concluded that too-close relationships -- those in which mothers were hyper-involved and overly critical -- could result in women with poor social skills and disordered attitudes about eating. We do know that the mother-daughter relationship tends to work best when the roles remain, for the most part, traditional. Indeed, mothers of both sons and daughters should worry less about getting caught up in ""perception"" and what other people think, especially at Mother's Day. If you suspect your son is a mama's boy, be thankful. Chances are, he will be, too.","Peggy Drexler: People stigmatize ""mama's boys,"" thinking they're weak .
In fact, studies show close relationship to mother can yield many benefits, she says .

"(CNN) -- For about 13 minutes, Team USA sat at the top of its World Cup soccer group, ahead of the mighty Germany and star-powered Portugal. Then Portugal struck back. With seconds left to play, Cristiano Ronaldo set up a header for his teammate Silvestre Varela, leaving the final score tied at 2-2. It was a harsh blow for the Americans, but it does not end their World Cup dreams -- it just makes them harder to achieve. With every team in Brazil now having played two matches, most groups now have clear winners and losers. But not Group G. In theory, any of the four teams in the group of Germany, the United States, Ghana and Portugal could still qualify for the knockout round. Here's how it could work for the United States. It plays Germany, the group leader, on Thursday. Third-ranked Ghana plays Portugal at the same time. If the United States beats Germany: . The Americans qualify for the knockout stage. Team USA would get three points for the victory, giving it seven. No other team in the group can match that, so the Americans go through to the next stage. Is that likely? It's possible, but it's not likely. Germany is the No. 2-ranked team in the world, and it hasn't lost a game yet this World Cup. The Americans haven't lost a game either, though. If the United States ties with Germany: . Both teams go through to the knockout stage. Each would get a point for the draw, giving them five points each. No matter who wins the Ghana-Portugal match, neither team can end up with more than four points. Is that likely? The odds aren't bad. Ghana held Germany to a draw Friday, proving that it can be done. Germany and the United States have each won one and drawn one. If the United States loses to Germany: . It's bad, but even that's not necessarily game over. Germany would definitely finish at the top of the group, and second place would depend both on how badly the Americans lose and what the margin of victory is in the Ghana-Portugal game. If the two teams draw, then the Americans come in second place. If Portugal wins by a narrow margin, USA still comes second in the group and goes through. But if Ghana wins by two or more, it'll be the Africans and not the Americans who advance -- making this the third World Cup in a row where Ghana eliminates Team USA. Monday's matches . Brazil and Mexico advanced to the Round of 16 with victories Monday while the Netherlands' win over Chile gave it the top spot in its group and the South Americans second place. Brazil continued its undefeated streak at home, cruising past hapless Cameroon 4-1 and earning the top spot in Group A. The SeleÃ§Ã£o will face Chile on Saturday in the Round of 16. The Netherlands, which downed Chile 2-0 in Group B, will face Mexico, 3-1 winners over Croatia, on Sunday. Already-eliminated Spain avoided total embarrassment Monday by cruising past Australia 3-0. Here's a quick catch-up on which teams have already qualified for the knockout stage and which ones cannot: . Through: . Brazil . Mexico . Netherlands . Chile . Colombia . Costa Rica . Argentina .

"(CNN) -- The wife of a Georgia man charged with murdering his toddler by leaving the child in a hot car for hours this summer has passed a polygraph test, her lawyer said Monday. So-called lie detector exams are not admissible in Georgia criminal court, and the test given to Leanna Harris was not court-sanctioned. She has not been charged in the case. But her attorney Lawrence Zimmerman said that a ""licensed veteran polygrapher and former law enforcement officer with decades of experience conducting polygraphs"" gave his client the test. He did not provide the full test questions and answers but gave reporters a select few questions and answers. The only questions Zimmerman provided: . â€¢ Prior to June 18, did you know that your husband would leave your son in that vehicle? â€¢ Did you plan or arrange with your husband to leave your son in that vehicle? â€¢ Did your husband tell you that he was going to leave your son in that vehicle? She answered no to those three questions, and the results showed that there was no deception in her answers, Zimmerman said. CNN asked Cobb County criminal lawyer Phil Holloway, who is not involved in the case, what he thinks of polygraphs as a means to gauge the truth. The tests are ""garbage"" and are used for ""public relations purposes,"" he said, to curry a more favorable opinion of a client with the public. Zimmerman said in August that Leanna Harris is ""concerned the district attorney's office may try to level a charge against her."" Police said Harris behaved strangely in the days before and moments after the death of her son. Georgia dad indicted on murder charges . One detective testified that she asked her husband, ""Did you say too much?"" in a police interview room after he was arrested. The detective also said that when employees at her son's day care told her that her son, Cooper, had not been dropped off as usual on the day he died, she responded, ""Ross (her husband) must have left him in the car."" Authorities have said both parents searched on the Internet for how hot a car needed to be in order to kill a child. ""She is holding up as best as any human being can. She's strong but she's very scared. She has lost a child. She's lost her husband, and she's waiting to see how this whole thing plays out, but it's very scary for her,"" Zimmerman said about his client. ""She believes it was an accident. There's no doubt in her mind,"" he said. Leanna Harris said she was a grieving mother caught up in ""the storm around my family,"" according to a victim impact statement obtained last month. ""The rush to judgment by the public and the mainstream media has left me with little confidence in our legal system and our society,"" the letter read. Read more: Mother lists herself as victim .

"(Wired) -- One of the most impressive spectacles visitors have found at the Sochi games doesn't have anything to do with sports at all. It's their own face, over 20 feet tall, rendered on a giant morphing wall at the entrance to Olympic Park. Read more: 'Brilliant Cube' lights up Gangnam . The Mt. Rushmore-style monument is ""the first thing you see when you go in,"" says Asif Khan, the British designer who conceived of the pavilion for Megafon, one of the games' sponsors. Spectators start by getting their likeness captured at one of seven photo booths throughout the park. A five-camera array generates a 3D image of the face, which is then processed for the facade, where it's rendered with 11,000 pistons, each acting as its own LED-tipped pixel. (After getting their picture taken, visitors get a QR code to scan that lets them know when to expect to see their mug go big.) Kahn worked with Basel-based engineering firm iart to bring the idea to life. Scott Eaton, a digital sculptor whose worked with animators at Lucasfilm and Pixar and contributed to films including ""Captain America"" and ""World War Z,"" was brought on as a sort of creative director for the project, creating a piece of software that situated each face at a certain angle. The faces, shown three at a time and cycled through every 20 seconds or so, are 8 meters tall -- larger than the face on the Statue of Liberty. Read more: The world's most incredible offices: Happier staff, more money? For Khan, the concept perfectly captured the spirit of the Olympics. ""I thought, if we can harness that latent emotive potential in the face, we can communicate with everyone -- without language, without any text, without anything,"" he explains. But he had to be careful about what he was communicating. At one point, Megafon wanted to explore the idea of rendering the faces in true color, using the LEDs to recreate spectators' skin tones. ""We had to pull that back a bit,"" Khan says. ""It looked like a giant was there. I mean, it was really scary."" Still, even in monochrome, the faces are a striking sight, harkening back to monumental sculptures of antiquity. If you want to put a more contemporary spin on the installation, you could think of it as a Mt. Rushmore for the Selfie Age.

"(CNN) -- All eyes will be on Lionel Messi and Arjen Robben when Argentina face the Netherlands in the World Cup semifinal in Sao Paulo to discover who will meet Germany in the final. The Dutch will be looking to their mercurial winger to steer them to a second successive World Cup final while Argentina will likely need some Messi magic if they are to reach a first final in 24 years. Both men have been central to the success of their sides so far in the competition earning glowing tributes from team managers past and present. Argentina coach Alejandro Sabella said his midfield maestro was like ""water in the desert"" following his side's 1-0 victory over Belgium in the quarterfinals. ""Each time he gets the ball, it represents hope for all of us and a threatening situation for our opponents,"" Sabella told reporters after the game. ""Regardless of whether he scores goals or not, his influence is decisive. A game has many aspects, apart from goals. ""When you have a player such as Messi, who never, or almost never, loses the ball, it's water in the desert and not just when he scores."" Dutch praise for Robben has been equally fulsome. Former Dutch coach Bert van Marwijk, who steered the Oranje to the final in 2010, believes Robben may be a better player than the Barcelona midfielder. ""Argentina have got Messi, we've got Robben. And quite frankly, I think the better player is Arjen,"" van Marwijk told Dutch broadcaster NOS TV. ""Four years ago, Arjen was injured just before the start of the tournament in a friendly against Hungary. He was carrying the injury for the whole tournament and was never really 100%. But this year he's been unstoppable."" Current teammate Dirk Kuyt has also lauded the Bayern Munich star's contribution in Brazil. ""I wouldn't swap Robben for any player in the world,"" Kuyt told FIFA.com earlier in the tournament. ""He is having an amazing World Cup. He's scored goals and created goals, he's so fast and he is a very important player for us."" Three goals and one assist at the finals attest to Robben's value, though he's also attracted plenty of criticism for his theatrical habit of going down in the penalty area during the tournament. Coach Louis van Gaal will need the 30-year-old to put in a flawless performance if the Dutch are to progress. As Sabella has hinted, two-time champions Argentina are perhaps even more reliant on Messi. The 27-year-old has scored half of Argentina's eight goals in the competition so far. With Angel di Maria ruled out with a thigh injury, strikers Gonzalo Higuain and Sergio Aguero (if passed fit) will be relying on Messi more than ever to set them free in front of goal. With three Ballon d'Or awards, three Champions League winners medals and six La Liga titles to his name, Messi would seal his place in football's pantheon if he became the first Argentine since Diego Maradona to lift the trophy. But he's not getting carried away just yet. ""To play a World Cup final with the great atmosphere of the Maracana is something what every player dreams of, but first we have to make sure we get there,"" Messi said, FIFA.com reported. Previous matches between the two sides have produced moments of individual brilliance -- Dennis Bergkamp's exquisite 90th-minute winner in the quarterfinal in 1998 was one of the greatest goals ever seen at a World Cup finals. Twenty-four years earlier it was Johan Cruyff who was strutting his stuff, scoring two goals for the Dutch in a 4-0 win at the 1974 finals hosted and won by Germany. Argentina's only victory against the Netherlands at a World Cup came in the 1978 final -- legendary striker Mario Kempes scoring twice in a 3-1 extra time win at the Estadio Monumental in Buenos Aires. For all the attacking flair on the pitch, the result, in the end, may hinge on the tactical nous of the men in suits standing on the touchline. Since taking over in 2011, Sabella has overseen just four losses in 39 matches. Van Gaal, meanwhile, has seen his side lose just twice in 26 matches during his second stint as the national coach. The 62-year-old, who will take over as manager at English Premier League side Manchester United after the World Cup finishes, has won plaudits for some cunning substitutions during the finals. The introduction of Klaas-Jan Huntelaar late in the game against Mexico helped turn the tide in the European side's favor. The Schalke striker, who came on for Robin van Persie in the 76th minute, laid off the ball for Wesley Sneijder's sumptuous 88th-minute strike before scoring a penalty in injury time as the Oranje snatched a 2-1 victory. Against Costa Rica in the quarterfinals, Van Gaal sent on goalkeeper Tim Krul in the dying seconds of extra time. The bold move worked as the Newcastle United keeper pulled off two saves in the shootout to send the Dutch into the semis and a step closer to a first World Cup title. ""Maybe Louis does have a golden willy,"" Robben cheekily said following the last-gasp win over Mexico in the last 16.

"(CNN) -- ""The food is excellent. The beer is cold. The sun nearly always shines. There is coffee on every corner. Life doesn't get much better than this."" That's Bill Bryson's take on Australia, and pretty much everyone else's. But beyond the beautiful beaches and cuddly marsupials, there are quirky, lesser-known facts to file away before preparing for a trip to Australia. Bust them out in an Aussie pub and you'll make instant friends. Not that they weren't going to be friendly anyway. 1. The Opera House was a major headache to build . Sydney's Opera House turns 40 this month. Celebrations in honor or the big birthday included an outdoor concert and a Danish design exhibition. But the performing arts center, which became a World Heritage Site in 2007, wasn't always so beloved. In 1956, Danish architect JÃ¸rn Utzon won the competition to design it, but construction proved tricky, resulting in years of delays and spiraling costs. Things came to a head in 1966 when the government refused to pay Utzon, resulting in his resignation. Peter Hall finished the job. Uzton didn't attend the official opening on October 20, 1973. Although amends were made in 1999, the architect never returned to Australia. 2.There are more camels than koalas . While the koala is a cuddly symbol of Australia, there are actually 10 times as many wild camels. Introduced in the 1800s to provide transportation through the country's desert heart, one million camels now roam the vast outback. The feral animals cause all sorts of problems, from drinking waterholes dry to destroying sacred Aboriginal sites. The population could double in a decade if left unchecked. This has prompted the government to adopt a controversial culling program. One place camels are welcome is the Northern Territory town of Alice Springs. Every July, the unpredictable beasts take center stage at the self-dubbed ""temperamental, terribly unpredictable, very entertaining"" Lasseters Camel Cup. 3. Aussies love to gamble . Australians are one of the world's biggest gamblers per capita, spending $1,314 each in 2012, according to H2 Gambling Capital. Slot machines -- ""pokies"" in the local vernacular -- are the nation's favorite bet, especially in New South Wales. The state has 100,000 slots in pubs and clubs, while Sydney is set to become the gambling capital when a second casino opens in 2019. But it's Victoria that pulls in the punters. Each November, the Melbourne Cup horse race stops the nation. It's so big it's a public holiday in the southern state. More: QT Sydney: The hottest, hippest historic hotel in town . 4. They invented Wi-Fi . Australia's national science agency, CSIRO, claims to have invented the wireless LAN technology that's the basis of Wi-Fi. Not everyone agrees, but it's got a patent to prove it. The agency has sued companies using the technology without a license -- its 20-year patent expires next month. It's not the first time the CSIRO has claimed a place in history. In July 1969, its 64-meter (209-foot) radio telescope in Parkes received television signals that allowed 600 million people to watch Neil Armstrong's moonwalk live. The observatory, affectionately known as ""The Dish,"" is open to visitors in the NSW country town that's also home to an annual Elvis festival. 5. The big island is surrounded by more than 8,000 smaller islands . Some people say Australia is the largest island on earth, while others call it a continent because it has its own tectonic plate. Whichever way you look at it, the island continent is fringed by thousands of smaller islands -- 8,222 to be precise. It's got an island state (Tasmania), the world's largest sand island (Fraser) and an Antarctic island (Macquarie). Many islands are named after animals, including Kangaroo Island off the South Australian coast, Lizard Island in the Great Barrier Reef and Cockatoo Island in Sydney Harbor. More: World's 100 best beaches . 6. It has a ""Greek city"" Melbourne has the largest Greek-speaking population in the world, after Athens and Thessaloniki. In fact, more than 200 languages and dialects are spoken in Australia. That's because more than 25% of Australians were born in another country, making Australia a melting pot of multiculturalism. Melbourne's vibrant Greek quarter around Lonsdale Street is home to Stalactites restaurant, a city institution open 24/7, and the annual Antipodes Festival, which features Zorba dancing and lots of souvlaki. 7. The country's one and only military coup was over rum . Aussies have a desperate love affair with beer, but in the late 18th century, rum was a popular form of payment in the fledgling colony of Sydney. That is until 1808, when Governor William Bligh decided to stop the practice. The edict didn't go down well with ringleaders of the rum trade, the New South Wales Corps. The regiment deposed Bligh in a military coup later known as the Rum Rebellion. The city's boozy past can be soaked up via a four-hour walking tour of the historic Rocks area with Sydney Urban Adventures ($137 per person). More: How to see the best of Sydney in a week . 8. Only 20 of its snakes will kill you . Most Aussies are proud of their killer wildlife. The country has 140 snake species and more of the venomous variety than any other continent. In fact, 20 of the world's 25 deadliest snakes are found slithering here, including the entire top 10. They're not all nasty. Snakes are naturally shy and would rather not come across humans. Just north of Sydney, the Australian Reptile Park has a milking program for its 200 venomous snakes. It also hosts hands-on wildlife shows. 9. Coast-to-coast takes four days by rail . Everyone knows Australia is a big place, but its size truly hits home on a trip from one side to the other. In 1912, work began on the Trans-Australian Railway to link Perth on the west coast with the eastern states. The first section built across the treeless Nullarbor Plain includes the longest stretch (478 kilometers/297 miles) of straight track in the world. Today, two iconic passenger trains use the line: the Indian Pacific trundles the 4,352 kilometers from Sydney and Perth in four days, while the Ghan takes three days to travel 2,979 kilometers from Darwin in the north to Adelaide in the south. 10. Burgers come with beets . In Australia, beets on a burger are a given. There are fancy burgers with goat cheese or chorizo, but a proper Aussie ""burger with the lot"" includes a slice of tinned beets. It also often comes with pineapple, fried egg, bacon, cheese and onions, but most Aussies will tell you the red veggies are what makes it taste so great.

"(CNN) -- When it comes to advertising on mobile devices, banner ads and pop-ups are the norm. But for Boston-based company SessionM, it's out with the old and in with the new. Lars Albright co-founded the organization in 2011 with business partners Mark Herrman and Scott Weller. The company aims to flip mobile advertising on its head by allowing users to interact with apps and adverts, and then rewarding consumers for engaging. CNN spoke with Albright to find out how SessionM is changing the nature of advertising on mobile. CNN: How does SessionM work? Lars Albright: The way it works is that the core software is getting integrated into a whole host of different applications. So it can be sports, news, weather, games. And with that base of applications that we have that gives us access to millions of users, we're then able to deliver very, very targeted advertising and affective advertising to those users. CNN: How do these rewards appear on-screen for users? LA: What it generally looks like, is you have a program where someone reaches an engagement milestone, like you've checked in for the day or you shared content with a friend or you've watched a video and a little message will pop-up and say, congratulations you've unlocked this achievement. And that achievement is something they can choose to claim at that time. Or they can ignore and claim later. Once they claim the achievement the loyalty layer comes full screen and they have a chance to then get congratulated by a sponsor and then they can go in and browse our store front the actual rewards they want to choose. And you can take your points and apply them for a sweepstakes, you can give to generate clean water, or get a Starbucks gift card. CNN: You previously worked in Apple's mobile advertising unit before transitioning to your own start-up. How did you make customers see the innovative potential in SessionM? LA: When you're truly doing something new, there's the advantage that you may be one of the few players that's doing something like this. But the challenge is that you have to educate the market and share your vision with the market. For us, part of it was just being really tenacious and persistent with getting our first customers to sign on and really and really saying or pitching that this was a chance for them to be a first, to be innovative as an organization and to be cutting edge on what's new and what's gonna work.","SessionM is redefining mobile advertising with customer rewards .

"Boston, Massachusetts (CNN)  -- Jim Gordon struggles to lift a book. It's 4,000 pages, more than a foot thick and one of the dozens of government reports over the last decade assessing the nation's first offshore wind farm. ""It's thicker than the health care bill,"" chuckles Gordon, the 56-year-old CEO of Cape Wind. Gordon's laugh has now turned into a celebratory smile. After a vicious nine-year fight on Cape Cod, Gordon has finally won approval of his wind farm to be built in the iconic waters of Nantucket Sound. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar on Wednesday signed off on the project. ""We're trying to pioneer a new path to move America forward in obtaining cleaner energy, a healthier environment and putting people to work to harness the inexhaustible winds that we're blessed with off the Cape,"" he said. It has been anything but easy. Cape Wind has spent more than $45 million -- most of it from Gordon's own pockets -- since 2001, when the project first sought a permit. His opponents have vilified him over the years as a greedy corporate energy man pillaging the pristine waters of the Sound. They say he's interested, not in green energy, but the green of the U.S. dollar. Gordon has refused to disclose potential earnings for his company; critics say Cape Wind stands to gain hundreds of millions in tax credits and subsidies. Gordon's hair has gone from black to gray since the fight began. And while the Cape has debated the project, countries like China have built their own offshore wind farms, forging ahead of the U.S. in wind energy. Gordon's opponents have come from the left and right. They have ranged from one of the most powerful senators in the nation's history -- the late Sen. Ted Kennedy -- to billionaire fossil fuel heavyweight William Koch. ""I'm for wind energy,"" Kennedy famously said. ""But we ought to do it right."" The Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port will have a view of the 130 wind turbines, located several miles from the shore. See how the views on the Cape will change . Koch, founder of the Oxbow Group and a resident of the Cape, sits on the board of Gordon's nemesis, the Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound. He's reportedly contributed more than $1.5 million to try to stop Cape Wind. Koch and his Oxbow Group have accused Gordon of duping the region, saying the Cape had better prepare for skyrocketing electricity prices. The price per kilowatt hour offshore is far higher than on land. ""This will only benefit one individual, and that's the developer himself, Jim Gordon,"" said Brad Goldstein, Koch's chief spokesman. ""Jim Gordon can try to wrap himself around wind all he wants. That dog will not hunt here."" Who is this wind man who challenged the nation's biggest power players -- and won? The son of a Boston grocer, Gordon says he decided to get into the energy business while waiting in line to get gas during the OPEC energy crisis of the 1970s. It was a wise decision: He consulted for power plants and made tens of millions of dollars by converting old power plants to natural gas facilities. He won over communities and brought in hundreds of jobs. In all, his group, Energy Management Inc., had seven New England power facilities; six of them were natural gas plants. He sold out in 2001 and with his millions turned his focus, and energy, to wind. ""He didn't buy an island in the Caribbean. He didn't sit on his money,"" said the Rev. William Eddy, a co-founder of Clean Power Now, a Cape Cod-based organization that has supported the wind farm. ""He decided to do something noble with it. You have to admire him for that."" Added Kert Davies, the research director for Greenpeace: ""He's amazingly tenacious and knows that it's a good project in the right place and a good thing for the economy and the planet. ... We're going to throw a party and toast Gordon."" Davies says every major environmental group has defended Cape Wind, because the U.S. needs to move away from its dependence on oil and expand its clean energy base. Gordon's biggest mistake, he says, was a belief that the project would be immediately embraced. The region's Democratic base and constant support of green energy made it seem like a sure deal. ""He underestimated what powers would come to bear on the other side,"" Davies said. ""It was a much tougher nut to crack than he thought. What it really boils down to is a few really rich local folks don't want it."" For two years, Glenn Wattley posed as the head of the Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound. Though a foe of Gordon's, Wattley admires him as a formidable opponent who has the quintessential American story -- a hard-working man who built a fortune out of nothing. ""Not only does he get an 'A' for effort, he gets an 'A-plus,'"" said Wattley, who has 35 years of experience in the energy market. ""He's shown himself to be very focused and very committed."" Gordon graduated from Boston University with a degree in public communications. Wattley says he used that to his advantage in the Cape Wind debate: ""He's a master at how you spin things."" Wattley's main beef with Gordon is the possibility of higher energy costs on the Cape. ""My sensitivity is my electric bill,"" he said. ""If we could really believe that prices would be lower, as he initially said, I don't see why this wouldn't be more popular."" Cape Wind has said it can't guarantee lower prices, but the energy will be cleaner. The head of NStar, one of Massachusetts largest utilities, recently told the Boston Globe that electric prices could go up in coming years due to renewable energy. That's another red herring from critics, says William Moomaw, a professor of international environmental policy at Tufts University's Fletcher School. ""The prices won't skyrocket for the local people. That's just non-sense,"" said Moomaw, part of a team that won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007.  ""There might be a small rise, but it would be relatively small."" He applauded Gordon for not bowing out in the face of withering criticism: ""Jim Gordon has to be one of the most persistent people who truly believes in the goal that he's set for himself. Most people would have pulled out long ago."" The wind farm turned into the most heavily vetted energy project in the nation, with dozens of public hearings and 17 state and federal agencies weighing in. The 130 turbines, spaced a third- to a half-mile apart, will cover about 25 of the 500 square miles of Nantucket Sound. They will stand more than 40 stories tall and provide up to 75 percent of the power to the Cape and islands. See the location of the wind farm . Gordon often visits his family home in Yarmouth on the Cape. Does he lie low while there because of the heated emotions Cape Wind has stirred? ""Not at all,"" he said. He finds just the opposite reaction. Locals come up to him in shops and restaurants. Keep going, they say. We know it's hard. The Cape Wind CEO admits he never anticipated the battle would drag on for nine years. That's too long, he says, for everyone involved -- from the affected communities to the investors to the government. The Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound has vowed to file a lawsuit to try to stop the project. Gordon says the group can try if it wants, but the Alliance should be prepared to lose again. He's now the pioneer behind Massachusetts' new revolution: offshore wind. He hopes to begin construction later this year, with the project completed by the end of 2012. ""When you believe in your heart that you have the right project at the right place at the right time,"" he said, ""you just keep putting one foot in front of the other.""","Jim Gordon faced a decade of criticism over his plan for nation's first offshore wind farm .

"(CNN) -- ESPN has fired the employee responsible for writing an offensive headline about basketball sensation Jeremy Lin and suspended an anchor who used the same ethnic slur, the sports network said Sunday. The headline read ""Chink in the Armor,"" referencing the New York Knicks' 89-85 loss Friday night to the New Orleans Hornets that ended the team's season-high winning streak. The phrase has two meanings; one is an ethnic slur. Lin, 23, came off the bench earlier this month to guide the Knicks to win after improbable win. The unlikely star of Taiwanese descent quickly turned into a global brand and ""Linsanity"" became the phrase of the times. The ESPN headline Saturday morning was up for 35 minutes before being removed, but the damage was done. The network apologized Saturday and said it was ""engaged in a thorough review."" It also apologized for a question ESPN anchor Max Bretos asked Wednesday night: ""If there is a chink in the armor, where can Lin improve his game?"" The network said Sunday that a third reference was made on ESPN Radio New York on Friday. ""The incidents were separate and different,"" ESPN said in a statement Sunday. ""We have engaged in a thorough review of all three."" Lin addressed the controversy during a news conference Sunday following the Knicks' 104-97 win over the Dallas Mavericks, the defending national champions. He said he did not think the headline was intentional. ""I don't think it was on purpose,"" Lin said. ""At the same time, they've apologized. I don't care anymore."" ESPN said the writer of the headline that appeared on the network's mobile website has been dismissed. Bretos has been suspended for 30 days. The radio commentator was not an ESPN employee. ""We again apologize, especially to Mr. Lin,"" ESPN said. ""His accomplishments are a source of great pride to the Asian-American community, including the Asian-American employees at ESPN. ""Through self-examination, improved editorial practices and controls, and response to constructive criticism, we will be better in the future,"" ESPN said.","NEW: ""I don't think it was on purpose,"" Lin says .

"(CNN) -- ""So, how many black friends do you have now?"" It's a question I get asked a lot, ever since I set out five years ago to find out why I, your typical middle-class white person, had no black friends at all. I do have black friends now, actually. Several. But I rarely offer that information when asked, because to ask white people how many black friends they have is to pose the wrong question. Recently, a Reuters poll came out showing that 40% of white Americans have zero nonwhite friends, and only 20% of white Americans have five or more nonwhite friends. People seemed shocked that the numbers were so bad. Personally, I was surprised that they were so good. America remains a deeply segregated and divided country. Even accounting for institutional and socioeconomic barriers, in the places we have the opportunity to integrateâ€”the high school cafeteria, for instanceâ€”we largely don't. The Reuters survey itself is misleading, lumping all minorities together under the vague heading of ""nonwhite."" Depending on what part of the country you live in (e.g, anywhere but Minnesota or Wyoming), it's not uncommon to have Asian or Hispanic friends. But the social divide between whites and those groups is more a function of the slow-rolling, generational process of immigrant assimilation. That is a wholly different phenomenon from the social divide between whites and blacks, which is the product of 400 years of slavery and segregation. That's the social divide we should worry about, and if the poll had focused on that, the numbers would surely have been much worse. The reason why ""How many black friends do you have?"" is such a terrible question is because it shows how we typically talk when we talk about race. Even when we try to talk about race in a constructive way, we usually make black people the object of the sentence, rarely the subject. Black friends are the things to be acquired to prove one is not racist. The way the question is asked accords black people no agency, nor does it reveal anything about the real character of the white person being queried. What you really want to know is not ""How many black friends do I have?"" but rather, ""Have I become the type of individual that a black person might choose to be friends with?"" That's a real question. Poll a couple thousand white people with that and you might start to get some interesting answers, or at least some confused and befuddled looks. White people are products of their own whitewashed, sanitized environment. Black people have been systematically excluded from white neighborhoods. Black stories rarely surface in popular culture. The history of race in high school textbooks has been boiled down to a handful of bedtime stories about Jackie Robinson and Rosa Parks. Try to tap into the average white person's feelings on race and you won't necessarily find feelings of hate and antipathy. You just won't find much of anything, no fully formed or well-considered thoughts about race of any kind. There's nothing really there. Even white people who want black friends don't know where to start. America's lack of integration wouldn't be such a big deal except for the fact that relationships and social networks are vital to economic advancement. Even when programs like school busing and affirmative action give black people access to white spaces, when those people go to climb the social ladder there's nothing there for them to grab onto, because there's very little reciprocal effort coming from the other direction. It's high effort and low reward. The result is that black people end up with integration fatigue. Many black writers responded to the Reuters poll with essays on why they didn't want white friends, and didn't need them. White friends weren't worth the bother. This is their prerogative, but ultimately, it's to society's disadvantage because white people control the access to, well, just about everything. If you don't have white friends, you might have a decent job and a comfortable life, but all the doors of opportunity in this country are not open to you. ""I may do well in a desegregated society,"" the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. said, ""but I can never know what my total capacity is until I live in an integrated society."" Interracial friendships, social bonds across the color line, are a key factor in putting the sins of America's past behind us. But it's not something that's accomplished by white people knowing lots of black people. It helps if white people know how to be better white people. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tanner Colby.","A recent Reuters poll shows that 40% of white Americans have zero nonwhite friends .

"(CNN) -- Some mothers choose what their children will eat. Others choose which children will eat and which will die. A Haitian boy begs for food. One child dies from hunger every six seconds, an aid agency says. Those mothers forced to make the grim life-or-death choices are the impoverished women Patricia Wolff, executive director of Meds & Food for Kids, encounters during her frequent trips to Haiti. Wolff says Haitians are so desperate for food that many mothers wait to name their newborns because so many infants die of malnourishment. Other Haitian mothers keep their children alive by parceling out food to them, but some make an excruciating choice when their food rationing fails, she says. ""It's horrible. They have to choose among their children,"" says Wolff, whose nonprofit group was formed to fight childhood malnutrition. ""They try to keep them alive by feeding them, but sometimes they make the decision that this one has to go."" The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. declared in his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech that ""I have the audacity to believe that peoples everywhere can have three meals a day for their bodies."" Four decades later, King's wish remains unfulfilled. The global food market's shelves are getting bare, hunger activists say -- and it will get worse. Food riots erupted across the globe this year in countries such as Egypt and India. Food pantries in the United States also warned that they were running out of food because of unprecedented demand. The news from the World Food Programme is even grimmer: A child dies of hunger every six seconds, and hunger now kills more people every year than AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis combined. As World Hunger Relief Week is marked, more people are asking: Why are so many people starving and what, if anything, can be done to eradicate hunger? The end of food? Wolff thinks hunger can be conquered. Her group produces ""Medika Mamba,"" energy dense, peanut butter food that's designed to ensure Haitian children survive childhood. Medika Mamba is easy to make, store, preserve and distribute, she says. ""It just takes the will to do it,"" she says of eliminating hunger. ""Look at what we did for Wall Street. We didn't have enough money for infrastructure, schools, but all of a sudden, we had all of this money for Wall Street."" Raj Patel, author of ""Stuffed and Starved: The Hidden Battle for the World Food System,"" says the right to food should be seen as a human right. But, he says, powerful corporate food distributors control too much of the world's food supply to ensure a robust global food supply. Patel says ""2008 was a record year in terms of harvest. There's more food per person in 2008 than there's ever been in history. The problem is not food, but how we distribute it."" Other causes for the rise in global hunger have been documented. They include: . • Surging oil costs have made it more expensive to harvest, fertilize, store and deliver food. • The rise in droughts and hurricanes worldwide has wiped out crops and made farming more difficult. • The world is running out of the raw materials -- water, oil, good farmland -- needed to keep the food system intact. ""A lot of people have begun to understand at various levels that the food system, as it is, can't go on,"" says Paul Roberts, author of ""The End of Food."" Every time an American bites down on a steak or hamburger, they're contributing to global hunger, Roberts says. As other countries become more affluent, they're copying our meat-heavy diet. The problem: It takes so much grain and other resources to produce meat, he says. ""If the rest of the world were to eat like we do, the planet would collapse,"" Roberts says. ""There's been this unspoken assumption that the rest of the world won't eat meat like we do. That doesn't go over well in countries like China."" Fixing our food system would be similar to weaning ourselves of our addiction to oil, Roberts says. It's going to require innovation, heavy business involvement and changes in public policy. People are going to have to find ways to grow food with less fertilizer and water, and use less energy to store and transport food, he says. Much of this innovation will have to be driven not just by activist and aid workers, but by savvy business people, he says. ""It's going to have to be profitable or the market won't be interested in it,"" Roberts says. ""And if the market isn't interested in it, it's not going to happen."" In the meantime, Wolff offers some of her own solutions. She says the practice of big foreign aid agencies shipping in food to poor countries like Haiti needs to be modified. Food has become too expensive to produce, ship and store, she says. ""You can't count on big aid agencies showing up to save everybody,"" she says. ""Not everybody can do it, and when they do it, it's not soon enough and not long enough."" She suggests that more groups teach local farmers in poor places how to produce their own crops. In Haiti, for example, her group employs 22 Haitians who make Medika Mamba and teaches other farmers how to grow crops for the mixture. ""Instead of throwing fish in the crowd, we should be teaching people how to fish,"" she says. Until that day takes place, Wolff, who is a pediatrician in St. Louis, Missouri, will continue to make her trips to Haiti, where mothers are forced to make their grim choices. ""It's the most difficult thing I've ever done,"" she says. ""You realize how absolutely blessed you are by the fate of your soul coming down the chute in the United States of America,"" she says. ""You wonder: Why did this happen to me and not to them?' ''","Global food system can't survive, author warns .

"Sydney, Australia (CNN) -- It's an awkward reality of royal reporting that we're also in the fashion business. To be perfectly frank I've no expertise nor credibility in this area but I do what I can by forwarding on any details I get from the palace. I also lean heavily on those who know what they're talking about. I'm certainly not dismissive. The ""Kate effect"" is a widely accepted phenomenon in the fashion business. The Duchess of Cambridge isn't known for high fashion; in fact she often wears high-street outfits that might even be -- gasp! -- out of season. But, when they're available, they'll sell out within hours of her wearing them, guaranteed. On tours like this one in Australia, there are new outfits appearing every day. When they're in the vaguely affordable bracket -- such as the $325 Diane Von Furstenberg wrap dress worn last week -- then it's spending spree time for her fans. Fashion detectives . Central to this phenomenon is an intrepid troupe of digital fashion scouts who identify and source Kate's outfits within minutes of them appearing in public. Chief scout would be Susan Kelley, best known by her Twitter handle: @WhatKateWore. Kelley was also the first to spot a potential challenger to Kate's royal fashion crown. Cue ""The George Effect."" ""Having one's child wearing the identical sweater a real-life Prince is wearing? That has a lot of cachet. Especially when it's something you can find at your local Baby Gap store,"" says Kelley. During George's main public engagement at Government House in Wellington, he was dressed in a pair of ""sailboat smocked dungarees"" by the British designer Rachel Riley. They were an instant sell-out in the smaller sizes. Susan Kelley says: ""There is also the allure that comes with scarcity. If there is such a thing as the anti-Kardashian baby then Prince George is it. He is not paraded out and about, his parents are not making deals to sell rights to photographs of him, he is very much protected behind the proverbial Palace walls. Nor is he seen wearing something new every time he is in public. ""The Duchess has done the same thing with his wardrobe she does with her own: repeating and recycling outfits. While the Prince has worn some more upscale items, designer duds for the sandbox set if you will, he has also worn those pieces more than once. His little cardigan with the soldiers on the front? Seen at least twice on the tour. His blue dungarees with the sailboat? Worn twice. I don't believe the Duchess has any intention of turning him into a clotheshorse."" Practical fashion? Kate certainly has a more relaxed sartorial approach than her regal predecessors. ""This hasn't been a vintage tour as far as royal fashion goes,"" says Rebecca English, royal correspondent for the UK's Daily Mail newspaper. ""But then, given the more casual nature of the trip, it hasn't leant itself to it either."" So far in Australia, the talk has been more about Kate's shoes than her outfits, says English: ""Particularly the fact that the Duchess has been wedded to her favorite wedge heels in even the most inappropriate situations. ""She wore five inch Russell and Bromley 'Corkswoon' wedges to walk around a mountain ledge with a stomach-churning 300-foot sheer drop in the Blue Mountains, and on the world famous surf beach at Manly she doggedly kept on her four inch Stuart Weizmann 'Minx' heels as she walked across the sand - even though her most senior aide had kicked hers off.""

"(CNN) -- Sony's big Wednesday event in New York for the new PlayStation 4 was streamed live online around the world -- filled with gameplay, tech talk and a display of new features. Curious gamers watched, flocking to Twitter and other social sites to share their thoughts. Perhaps ironically, not everyone was a fan of the PS4's ability to share via social sites. Lead system architect Mark Cerny outlined a menu of new social features built in to the PS4 such as sharing gameplay with friends, being connected through existing social networks and monitoring what you play and what you purchase. ""Why does Sony think we want to tell everyone about what games we're playing?"" Andrew Meskill wrote on Twitter. ""I want to sit in a dark room on my own with a pad."" In the gaming world, some said, sharing isn't always a plus. ""I would much rather figure out how to beat the game myself rather than have someone complete it for me,"" Chris Jarvis tweeted. And in the social age, whenever there's talk of sharing, inevitably the discussion turns to privacy concerns. ""'This system is very aware of the player and whatever is going on in the room at any given point,"" tweeted Jason Evangelho, a tech contributor for Forbes. ""I DO NOT want this, do you?"" But Dennis Fong, CEO of gaming-oriented social site Raptr, told CNN he thinks the social sharing feature built in to the PS4 is exactly what next-generation devices should be doing. ""The ability to capture an image, video, or instantly broadcast what's on your screen to your friends is transformational for the new generation of consoles,"" Fong said. ""Providing players community tools to create content for your game in the form of videos and live broadcasts is not simply a cool feature for gamers but also great for business. User-generated content keeps players engaged with the game even while they aren't playing it and also attracts new users from the buzz generated around this content."" But features aside, a gaming system is only as good as its games. That theme started early in the day when gamers on Twitter created the trending hashtag #PlayStationMemories. Many used it to recall fondly playing classic titles such as ""Crash Bandicoot"" or ""Spyro the Dragon"" on the original PlayStation console. Sony showed off how powerful the PS4 will be with in-game footage and demos from a handful of new titles, including updates to the ""Killzone"" and ""InFamous"" franchises. Their visuals and gameplay demos induced a lot of digital drooling. ""The pre-release video of 'Killzone 2' convinced me to get a PS3. 'Killzone 4' might've just done the same for the #PS4. Outstanding!"" Jon Lomas wrote about the demo for ""Killzone: Shadow Fall."" Even brand new games, such as ""Deep Down"" from Capcom, drew praise despite not showing any in-game footage. Lauren Anne liked what she saw when a dragon appeared on screen. ""Oh yes! Deep Down is going to be my top purchase for PS4!"" she tweeted. ""Dragons and gorgeous graphics are win-win for me!"" But the snark Twitter is famous for was evident during the rollout of ""InFamous: Second Son,"" a game set in a dystopian future where cameras monitor your every move. ""Ironically, this game is coming out on a system that will track & broadcast every damn thing you do or play or buy,"" wrote Game Informer senior features editor Matt Helgeson. Some folks didn't like that while tons of details were rolled out, the PlayStation 4 console wasn't displayed Wednesday. ""#2HoursIllNeverGetBack,"" tweeted one user in the site's hashtag-as-punchline style. Richard Preston went with a more established Internet catchphrase. ""Pic or it didn't happen,"" he wrote. In the end, most who paid attention seemed impressed with what they saw. But not all were ready to hand Sony the console-wars victory. ""#PS4 looking nice, but can't wait to see what #Microsoft has,"" wrote one user. ""The ball is in your court now."" Many gaming insiders predict that Microsoft will show off its new console -- possibly the Xbox 720 -- at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in June. That would likely mean new consoles from the two rivals both will hit the market in time for the holidays.","Gamers react to news about the new PlayStation 4 .

"(CNN) -- What happened in Cairo today sends a chilling message to any journalist covering Egypt: If you speak to a group whose message the government wants suppressed, you can be prosecuted and jailed for it. In other words, you can be imprisoned for doing your job. The lengthy sentences against three Al Jazeera journalists -- Peter Greste, Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed -- convicted of aiding terrorists and spreading false information have shocked and angered many around the world. And inside the Cairo courtroom, those closest to the accused were left reeling. ""Well, to be perfectly honest, my mind was blank. There was total disbelief,"" Peter Greste's brother Mike told me. ""I can't comprehend the decision made by the court today."" Mike Greste said the convicted trio were lead out of their cage shortly after the sentences were handed down. With no way to speak to his brother, he says he put his hand on his heart and raised a fist into the air to give Peter some encouragement. Condemnation of the court's ruling was swift. A Human Rights Watch researcher, Heba Morayef, tweeted that even deposed president Hosni Mubarak would never have jailed prominent journalists in this way: . It now appears as though no amount of political pressure or public outrage has swayed authorities in Egypt who -- after ousting President Mohamed Morsy of the Muslim Brotherhood last year -- have made it clear they will not tolerate dissenting voices. There is of course the fact that the three work for Al Jazeera, which is funded by the Qatari government and seen as supportive of the Muslim Brotherhood. Some have said the journalists are being used as pawns in a political rivalry between Egypt's new rulers and Qatar. The network issued a statement shortly after the ruling, saying the verdict ""defies logic, sense, and any semblance of justice."" The prosecution case against Greste, Fahmy and Mohamed included material from a story that was filmed when none of the defendants were even in the country. On another day, footage of a trotting horse was used by the prosecution. On yet another, music by Australian singer Gotye was introduced into evidence. All this would be genuinely hilarious if it hadn't ended in the sentences read out today by the judge. Verdicts that mean the three journalists were led back into custody once again as prisoners in the new Egypt. As for what the future may hold, Mike Greste told me his brother will appeal the sentence. ""We have to maintain support for Peter and continue to fight for his innocence."" As for us journalists, should we be concerned that if we do our duty -- in other words if we speak to all sides when reporting from Egypt -- we too will be tried, convicted and jailed for a crime we did not commit?

"(CNN) -- While Uruguay's star striker faces an uncomfortable wait to see what his alleged chomp on Giorgio Chiellini will mean for the rest of his World Cup -- and possibly his international future post-Brazil -- the world was equally aghast and amused at the sight of the footballer's on-field antics. Luis Suarez, who plays his club football for English Premier League team Liverpool and has just come off the back of an inspirational season, appeared to bite Italy defender Chiellini towards the end of their World Cup group game. He wasn't punished on the pitch, and Uruguay duly went on to win the match, knocking four-time champions Italy out in the process. Suarez is a national hero in Uruguay, a truly world-class player from this small but football-obsessed nation. His inclusion in the team despite a recent injury layoff has inspired La Celeste to two wins and qualification to the next round. Unrepentant . But while the world howls in barely-concealed glee and indignation at the incident, the Uruguayan press is remaining po-faced about Suarez' latest on-field folly. Montevideo's fourth estate mostly played down the incident, with El Pais leading with the fact that FIFA will investigate the incident, alongside a fairly sympathetic report carrying comments made by Suarez to TV station Channel 10 Uruguay, in which he played down his part in the scuffle. ""These things happen in the (penalty) box,"" an unrepentant Suarez was reported as saying. They certainly do, if only for him. This is the third time he's been accused of baring his fangs on the pitch, following incidents in Holland and England. In 2010 he received a seven-match ban for a bite on PSV Eindhoven's midfielder Otman Bakkal, and was sanctioned again in 2013 for gnawing on Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic. That earned him ten games on the sidelines. He was also accused of racially abusing French international Patrice Evra during an EPL match, earning him an eight-game ban. He also has World Cup form, ruining Ghana's hopes of progressing last time out with an obvious handball. In South Africa, too, he seemed to show little remorse. Support . The player received the immediate backing of his international manager. ""If you continue to attack we will see how to defend Suarez,"" Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez said, quoted in the Uruguayan edition of futbol,com. ""This is a World Cup and not cheap morality."" The site also carried a piece slamming the English press' reaction to their pantomime villain's latest on-field snack. The Uruguayan reaction wasn't all denial, however. McDonald's in Uruguay got in early with a twitter joke at the national hero's expense, inviting him to come assuage his hunger at one of their restaurants: ""Hey @luis16suarez, if you're still hungry take a bite of a Big Mac."" The refrain was echoed around the twittersphere, with a number of companies bearing toothy grins as they made light of Suarez' actions. #suarez and #bansuarez also trended for hours after the game. FIFA has opened proceedings against the forward, for breach of FIFA disciplinary code. FIFA added that Suarez and/or his national association are invited to provide their position and any documentary evidence they deem relevant, with a 5 p.m. (Brasilia time) deadline.

"(CNN) -- Of the four to five billion injections given each year in India, at least 2.5 billion are unsafe, according to one study. In some cases, that means they are administered using unsterilized second-hand syringes that could be contaminated with a blood-borne disease such as hepatitis or HIV. A simple change to the way syringes are made could dramatically reduce those figures and save thousand of lives each year, according to David Swann of Huddersfield University, in England. His design for a new kind of syringe that changes color after it has been used was nominated for an INDEX: Award. ""1.3 million people (globally) a year die from unsafe injection practices,"" Swann says, quoting WHO figures. ""It accounts for over 30% of hepatitis A and B cases and 5% of HIV cases."" He explained that in India it is common for scavengers to hunt through landfill sites looking for old syringes that they can clean up and sell to clinics. ""When you compare a sterile syringe just out of its packaging with a syringe that's been washed, how do you determine the difference?"" he said. ""We conceived an intelligent ink that, if exposed to air by taking it out of the package or if the package is breached that would activate it and turn it red."" Read this: Tiny computer takes prize at design awards . The ABC Syringe is impregnated with an ink that's sensitive to carbon dioxide and then sealed in a protective atmosphere so that it remains transparent until it is ready for use. After the seal is broken, the shell of the syringe starts to turn a dark red, alerting both doctors to the risk that the syringe may already have been used. Swann's intention is that the introduction of the ABC syringe should be accompanied by a public information campaign so that patients would also associate a red syringe with danger and would be able to insist on sterile equipment. ""We had to be really quite clever in looking at technologies that cost next to nothing, and modified-air packaging is one of those technologies,"" Swann said. ""It only adds 1% to the retail price, so on a two-and-a-half pence (four cents) syringe it becomes quite an interesting proposition."" According to Swann's calculations, if the ABC syringe is used for 5% of injections administered in India, after five years it will have prevented more than 700,000 infections and saved $130 million in medical costs. Watch this: Life-saving device brings hope to India . Denis Maire, who works for the World Health Organization's health systems and innovation taskforce, said the ABC Syringe could help to make injections safer. ""Anything that can contribute to decrease the reuse of syringes is worth considering and cost is certainly a major factor,"" he said. ""The great advantage of this concept is that not only health care workers but also patients can have a visual appreciation on the safety status of the device. In my view this could be a good deterrent for practitioners to reuse."" However, he noted that it would be possible for unscrupulous doctors to override the visual warning if their patients did not know the meaning of the color change. He also said that the one-minute delay before the syringe turned red may not be long enough. ""How would you distinguish good and bad syringes if the injections are not practised inside this lap of time?"" he said. ""It could create confusion and render the concept ineffective."" Ravi Naidoo, a member of the INDEX Award jury and the managing director of Design Indaba, an agency that aims to put creative ideas into practice, said that working with the international medical community would help to turn the prototype into a viable product. ""This innovation speaks to the endless possibilities of design, creativity and innovation in addressing real-world issues,"" he said. ""In addition to being cost-effective, which will ensure the accessibility of the solution, it also allows patients to take charge of a critical issue â€” great example of empowerment through smart design.""","Scavengers in India clean old syringes from landfill sites and sell them to clinics .

"(CNN) -- These are extraordinary times, and like a lot of Republicans I believe that a well-crafted stimulus plan is needed to put people back to work. But the Obama spending bill would stimulate the government, not the economy. Mitt Romney says Obama's spending bill would stimulate the government rather than the economy. We're on an economic tightrope. The package that passed the House is a huge increase in the amount of government borrowing. And we've borrowed so much already that if we add too much more debt, or spend foolishly, we could invite an even bigger crisis. We could precipitate a worldwide crisis of confidence in America, leading to a run on the dollar or hyperinflation that wipes out family savings and devastates the middle class. It's still early in the administration of President Obama. Like everyone who loves this country, I want him to adopt the correct course and then to succeed. He still has a chance to step in and insist on spending discipline among the members of his own party. It's his job to set priorities. I hope for America's sake that he knows that a chief executive can't vote ""present."" He has to say yes to some things and no to a lot of others. As someone who spent a career in the private sector, I'd like to see a stimulus package that respects the productivity and genius of the American people. And experience shows us what it should look like. First, there are two ways you can put money into the economy, by spending more or by taxing less. But if it's stimulus you want, taxing less works best. That's why permanent tax cuts should be the centerpiece of the economic stimulus.  Watch Romney make argument for tax cuts » . Second, any new spending must be strictly limited to projects that are essential. How do we define essential? Well, a good rule is that the projects we fund in a stimulus should be legitimate government priorities that would have been carried out in the future anyway, and are simply being moved up to create those jobs now. As we take out nonessential projects, we should focus on funding the real needs of government that will have immediate impact. And what better place to begin than repairing and replacing military equipment that was damaged or destroyed in Kuwait, Iraq and Afghanistan? Third, sending out rebate checks to citizens and businesses is not a tax cut. The media bought this line so far, but they've got it wrong. Checks in the mail are refunds, not tax cuts. We tried rebate checks in 2008 and they did virtually nothing to jump-start the economy. Disposable income went up, but consumption hardly moved. Businesses aren't stupid. They're not going to invest in equipment and new hires for a one-time, short-term blip. What's needed are permanent rate cuts on individuals and businesses. Fourth, if we're going to tax less and spend more to get the economy moving, then we have to make another commitment as well. As soon as this economy recovers, we have to regain control over the federal budget, and above all, over entitlement spending for programs such as Social Security and Medicare. This is more important than most people are willing to admit. There is a real danger that with trillions of additional borrowing -- from the budget deficit and from the stimulus -- world investors will begin to fear that our dollars won't be worth much in the future. It is essential that we demonstrate our commitment to maintaining the value of the dollar. That means showing the world that we will put a stop to runaway spending and borrowing. Fifth, we must begin to recover from the enormous losses in the capital investment pool. And the surest, most obvious way to get that done is to send a clear signal that there will be no tax increases on investment and capital gains. The 2001 and 2003 tax cuts should be extended permanently, or at least temporarily. And finally, let's exercise restraint in the size of the stimulus package. Last year, with the economy already faltering, I proposed a stimulus of $233 billion. The Washington Post said: ""Romney's plan is way too big."" So what critique will the media have for the size of the Obama package? In the final analysis, we know that only the private sector -- entrepreneurs and businesses large and small -- can create the millions of jobs our country needs. The invisible hand of the market always moves faster and better than the heavy hand of government. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mitt Romney.","Mitt Romney: We're in extraordinary times and we need to stimulate economy .
He says Obama's plan would stimulate the government more than economy .
Giving people permanent tax relief would be better than higher spending, he says .

"(CNN) -- Glass screens that can feel the touch of your fingers are all the rage these days. You'll find them in all kinds of gadgets, from smartphones to tablet computers. But the way a team of Disney Researchers sees it, there's one huge problem with this technology: All glass screens feel exactly the same. So, OK, that ""problem"" may not be keeping you up at night. But think about the difference between typing on a hardware keyboard, where you can feel whether your fingers are hitting the right keys, and a touch screen keyboard, where the letters ""q"" and ""w"" feel exactly the same -- as does the space between them. That's the problem that Disney Research is hoping to solve with a new technology it's calling ""TeslaTouch."" This new type of touch screen, which was demonstrated for the first time at a tech conference in New York this week, uses a small static force to control friction between a user's finger and the touch screen. ""It's kind of like a buzzing or a vibration. It has the same effect as a buzz,"" said Chris Harrison, one of the Disney researchers and a Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University. ""But if you carefully tune the frequency and the vibration of the panel you can actually create things that feel like sandpaper or rubber or a wall."" In the case of a touch screen keyboard -- like those on the Apple iPhone, for example -- users would be able to feel the location of the keys, and could learn to ""touch type"" without looking at their hands, he said. When people clicked on a file to drag it into a folder, they would be able to feel the weight of the file and would know, through their sense of touch, that it had landed in the appropriate location, he said. Larger files, like HD movies, could also be made to seem heavier than small files, like text documents, Harrison said. ""A heavier document, like one that's going to take longer to transfer, is going to feel heavier,"" he said. Unlike other attempts at touch-screen technology with ""haptic feedback,"" or impulses that stimulate the sense of touch, TeslaTouch has no moving parts. It uses small electrical impulses -- kind of like those involved in static cling -- to create a pull and push between a person's fingertip and the gadget's screen. Here are some of the nerdy details: The touch screen is made up of three layers. A glass plate, topped with a transparent electrode and an insulator, is what people touch. To simulate friction and texture, the electrode creates small electrical fields in the insulation layer. These fields oscillate between positive and negative charges, creating those sensations. Others have tried to use vibrations to make touch-sensitive screens feel more realistic. The BlackBerry Storm's screen, for example, compresses and clicks when users push on it successfully. But that doesn't allow for users to touch different parts of the screen and receive different touch sensations, Harrison said. That is possible with TeslaTouch. The Disney Research technology, which has not been commercialized, has been incorporated into at least two prototypes. One mobile device was demonstrated this week at a conference held by the Association for Computing Machinery. Another touch screen table is working at the Disney Research offices in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, he said. Check out the project's website for a video demo (bonus features include mysterious hands petting cats, pinching cloth and fondling glassware). If you're feeling especially studious, the research team has posted an academic paper that explains more fully how the tech works. He said this technology isn't the ""magic bullet"" that will bring multitouch, tactile touch screens into the mainstream. But it may move them one step closer.","A new form of touch-screen technology debuts this week .

"(CNN) -- In a rare move, ""Alone Yet Not Alone"" is ending its Oscar run on a low note. The Academy rescinded the best original song nomination for the film of the same name over accusations of improper campaigning. Its board of governors voted Tuesday night after revelations that the song's composer, Bruce Broughton, e-mailed members during the voting period. Broughton is a former member of the board. ""No matter how well-intentioned the communication, using one's position as a former governor and current executive committee member to personally promote one's own Oscar submission creates the appearance of an unfair advantage,"" said Cheryl Boone Isaacs, president of the Academy.

"(CNN) -- An awful lot of companies have tried to figure out how to make consumers want to stream Internet video in the living room. One of the few to have succeeded is Roku, whose cheap little boxes offer easy access to 1,200 channels of content, from biggies such as Netflix, Amazon and HBO Go to stuff you never knew existed. The company has sold 8 million boxes, which have been used to watch 1.7 billion hours of video to date. At this year's CES show in Las Vegas, Roku's big news is that it's going to be possible to watch those 1,200 channels without even paying for and hooking up that cheap little box. It's going to work with TV companies to build Roku TVs. Roku will design the entire interface, as well as the super-simple remote control; essentially, it'll be as if a Roku box sprouted a gigantic screen. (This is, by the way, Roku's second pass at partnering up with TV builders: The first is the Roku Streaming Stick, a tiny doohickey designed to be bundled with TVs.) The first two TV makers Roku is working with are two Chinese companies: TCL and Hisens. Considering their low profiles in the U.S, that doesn't sound like a big whoop, but the two Chinese manufacturers are the third and fifth largest TV producers globally, according to Roku. And both see built-in Roku as a way to raise their profile in the U.S. market. Anthony Wood, Roku's founder and CEO, told me that TCL and Hisense are just the start. Designing Internet TV software and services and signing up content partners is such a major undertaking that he sees Roku TV as an appealing proposition for every TV producer except Samsung. ""Our goal is to be the platform for TV,"" he says. These first two companies plan to ship Roku TVs in a variety of sizes from 32 inches to 55 inches this fall. Pricing will be announced later, but ""we think that smart TV features should be in every TV for essentially the same price,"" Wood told me. ""I'm sure there will be some small premium at the beginning.""","Roku will work with TV manufacturers to build Roku TV sets .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Walking down the streets of Beijing, it's hard to avoid seeing red slogans lining the sidewalks. Switching on a TV at home, almost every channel hosts a gala show performed on a red-colored stage. Such things are all part of a country-wide ""red"" campaign that China has promoted for several months in preparation for its big red-letter day, July 1. On that day, the Communist Party of China (CPC) celebrates its 90th birthday. The campaign ranges from impromptu singing sessions of ""red songs"" in city squares to touching personal stories of ""red stars"" in Chinese newspapers; from showing red movies in theaters to red tours of former party leaders' hometowns. A focus of the campaign has been on historical sites of the Revolution. According to CCTV, more than 8 billion yuan (US$1.2 billion) has been spent sprucing up famous places like Mao Zedong's hometown since 2004, and thousands of young professionals are encouraged to visit these sites. In his hometown, Mao a source of pride . In Beijing, preparation for the big day is intense. A giant emblem of the Communist Party, the hammer and sickle, was erected at the heart of Tiananmen Square. Huge flower displays of the number 90 are at all major intersections. Banners with slogans congratulating the Party's achievement hang at pedestrian overpasses. 'Red Songs' campaign . The current fervor originated in Chongqing when Bo Xilai became the Party chief of China's biggest city. The municipality launched its ""red song"" campaign in June 2008 as the start of the Red Culture Movement. Bo promoted 45 red songs ""by any means necessary,"" hoping they would replace pop songs in the hearts of the people. ""Red songs"" refers to the pro-revolutionary songs that were popular during the country's revolution, reconstruction and reform period, according to Xinhua news agency which quoted music professor Fan Zhuyin. Soon, the red song movement took one step further in Chongqing. The Chongqing satellite TV station suspended all crime shows and soap operas during prime hours TO show classic revolutionary dramas and musicals instead. It didn't take long for Chongqing, in the south-west, to earn the nickname ""Tomato,"" or ""Xi Hong Shi"" in Chinese -- the same pronunciation as ""west red city"". Nostalgia . The Chinese central government praised the red song movement as a wonderful example, encouraging other cities to follow suit. And they did. More and more organized singing and Red competitions are happening in all different corners of China. ""I could sing these songs in the past and they can be dated back to my childhood,"" 62-year-old Lu Zhichun told CNN in Beijing. ""My feelings toward these songs have not changed at all."" Lu and a group of senior citizens gather in Beijing's Jingshan Park once a week to sing red songs. They said that all the red songs give them a sense of nostalgia. ""The government would like to see the nostalgia of the revolutionary era through songs many can identify as a means of increasing social cohesion,"" explains Wenran Jiang, associate professor at University of Alberta in Canada. Communists, 90 years later, still fighting corruption . ""It hopes that people can unite under common themes of building a better society, a strong country with the CPC still as its leadership in the many decades ahead,"" Jiang says. Painful flashbacks . But to some Chinese, the red culture movement is not just another political campaign of the government. The feverish propaganda style and the enthusiasm it requires many painful flashbacks to Mao's Cultural Revolution and the ensuing political violence where tens of thousands died. Blogger Kun Yun Shan Fang wrote recently, ""Today's red song movement, to many people, brings back pain and trauma, and memories of being senseless and crazy which remind me of our wasted youth."" The red campaign has given rise to a heated debate on Mao's legacy. The 82-year-old economist Mao Yushi (no relation to Mao Zedong) declared in an article last month that Mao was one of the last century's greatest murderers and should no longer be regarded as a god by the Chinese people. In response, conservative website garnered more than 50,000 signatures for a petition to have Mao Yushi prosecuted, and they have sent the petition to the National People's Congress, China's parliament. At the recent press conference, when asked whether red song chorales springing up nationwide indicate an ideological return to the past, Wang Xiaohui, a senior official at the CPC Central Committee, said the red song fever does not signal an ideological shift. Read more of CNN's China coverage . He Bing, a law professor at the Chinese University of Political Science and Law posted a critical comment that has been circulated all over the Chinese web: ""This is a very absurd time: they encourage you to sing revolutionary songs, but don't encourage you to have a revolution; they encourage you to see the movie 'The Founding of the Party,' but don't encourage you to found a party."" ""It is an obvious effort by the CPC to mobilize popular support in Chinese society at the 90th anniversary. It is further intended to boost the CPC's legitimacy before next year's party congress when younger and less known leaders take over,"" said Wenfang Tang, professor at the University of Iowa. ""What will be interesting to observe is how the younger generations (post-1980) react to such a propaganda campaign,"" Tang says. ""Their attitude toward the CCP is the key to China's political future,"" Tang explains.

"(CNN) -- London experienced protests in the both the east and center of the capital just hours before the Olympic opening ceremony. Taxi drivers gathered at Hyde Park corner as part of a demonstration against Olympic traffic lanes, while protestors held a ""die-in"" against major sponsor Dow Chemicals outside the Olympic Park in Stratford. Despite the protest, thousands turned out to see the torch make it's final journey through London. Preparations were also in place for a special opening night concert in Hyde Park featuring bands Snow Patrol and Duran Duran. The first world records of the London 2012 Olympics were set by blind South Korean archer Im Dong Hyun-- hours before Friday's much-anticipated opening ceremony was due to begin. The traffic protest started at 2pm, with taxi driver Mick Bailey telling CNN: ""We're all sitting in our cabs and traffic is at a standstill. It's a sea of black cabs as far as the eye can see. Cab drivers argue the traffic lanes -- which are restricted to Olympic officials and athletes -- should also be available to taxis. Mick, who has been a Black Cab driver for more than 30 years, said businesses had dropped off since the implementation of the lanes. He added: ""The Olympic lanes are going to mean a great deal of hardship for drivers and passengers. We won't be able to pick up people on the left hand side of the road, there will be diversions and higher meter readings."" By 3pm the serious congestion had eased, the Automobile Association (AA) said. The protest followed another demonstration against major sponsor Dow Chemicals Friday morning. Members of the Bhopal Medical Appeal held a 'die-in' in protest against the company it claims has responsibility for the fatal 1984 gas leak in India. Dow Chemicals is a major sponsor of the Olympics, with the multimillion-pound deal including a fabric wrap around the stadium in east London. However, the deal has caused controversy with campaigners arguing Dow holds responsibility for the disaster in Bhopal, which killed an estimated 15,000 --- a claim which it denies. Dow bought Union Carbide -- the company which ran the plant -- 16 years after the disaster and argues it has no responsibility. Protesters gathered at 10.30am outside the gates of the Olympic park. Dressed in shrouds, they pretended to be ""dead"" -- a reference to victims of the fatal leak at the pesticide plant. London Assembly member Navin Shah told gathered protesters: ""I am proud that the Games are taking place in London but the protesters like me are simply against the sponsorship of Dow Chemical who have betrayed the victims of the Bhopal Disaster. These protests symbolize peoples' concerns about large scale environmental and human rights abuses."" Dow Chemicals told CNN it remained ""fully committed to our partnership with the IOC and to contributing to a successful, positive London 2012 Games"" and questioned whether the protest should go ahead. ""The use of the Olympic Games to protest has become an unfortunate part of what should be a global celebration. We believe in freedom of speech and encourage debate on this important issue,"" said a Dow spokesman in a statement. ""However, we regret the misinformed and misdirected allegations and actions of some, which are not constructive to the resolution of the issue or consistent with the spirit of the Olympic Games.""","London cab drivers cause gridlock in Olympic lanes protest .

"(CNN) -- The death of a 10-month-old girl left in a hot car in Wichita, Kansas -- the latest in a string of hot-car child deaths in the United States -- triggered the quick arrest of the girl's foster father and on Friday prompted state officials to launch home inspections of adoptive and foster families. The foster father told police he picked up the child from a babysitter about 4 p.m. Thursday, drove home and forgot the child was in the back seat, according to Lt. Todd Ojile of the Wichita Police Department. Investigators say the girl was locked in the car with the windows up for some two-and-a-half hours. Temperatures in the Wichita area reached the low 90s on Thursday. The foster father was in the process of adopting the girl with his partner, according to police. ""Both were extremely upset,"" Ojile said. Ojile says the couple's other children have been removed from the home as the investigation continues. The couple are the adoptive parents of two children and are foster parents to four others with ages ranging from 3 to 18 years old, he said. On Friday, Kansas Department for Children and Families Secretary Phyllis Gilmore ordered immediate home inspections for all adoptive and foster families associated with the agency that approved the couple for foster care. The 29-year-old foster father, whose name was not released by police, was booked on an aggravated endangerment charge but has not been formally charged. Ojile said the district attorney could file charges as early as next week. So far in 2014, according to statistics compiled by the Department of Geosciences at San Francisco State University, there have been at least 18 heatstroke deaths of children left in vehicles. In one highly publicized case, a Georgia father remains in jail awaiting trial on murder and child cruelty charges in the death of his toddler son, who was left in the father's SUV for seven hours. Should the government step in to prevent hot car deaths?

"(CNN) -- Nigerians staging a daily protest in the capital said Saturday they are fed up with their government's indifference to the abduction of nearly 300 schoolgirls, even as the Nigerian president once again promised to bring them home. For 11 days, the protesters in Abuja have demanded Nigeria do more to rescue the girls, who were kidnapped more than three weeks ago by the Islamist terrorist group Boko Haram. They vow to sit every day until the girls are rescued. ""We need to keep this up every day,"" protest organizer Rotimi Olawale told CNN. ""We are saying that we want our girls alive."" Saturday, President Goodluck Jonathan said he was worried about the girls and he thanked other countries, including the United States, that have pledged support in finding them. ""We promise the world that we must get these girls out,"" Jonathan said. U.S. support for Nigeria . U.S. first lady Michelle Obama on Saturday condemned the ""unconscionable"" kidnapping of the girls, saying in the White House weekly radio address it was the work of ""a terrorist group determined to keep these girls from getting an education."" Earlier this week, Obama tweeted a photo of herself with a sign that said #BringBackOurGirls. U.S. and British officials are in Abuja to help Nigeria's government look for the girls, plan rescue missions and advise on ways to subdue Boko Haram. President Barack Obama has directed his administration to do everything possible to help the Nigerian government, the first lady said. 'Nothing has been done' Scrutiny of the Nigerian government's response to the kidnappings has escalated. A report Friday from Amnesty International says authorities knew at least four hours before the attack that Boko Haram was on its way to raid the girls' boarding school in the northeastern town of Chibok. The report's findings echo accounts of a number of the girls' parents and villagers, who have described to CNN an ineffective military response in the days and weeks after the girls were taken. ""Nothing on the ground. Nothing,"" a Nigerian father told CNN. ""(For) 21 days, nothing has been done."" A young mother from Chibok said all that families have left is hope. ""If 23 years ago somebody had abducted me, taken me away and killed my dreams, where would I be today? I might be dead,"" Aisha Yesufu said. ""And for those kids, for nobody to care?"" Boko Haram's leader, Abubakar Shekau, took credit for the mass kidnappings in a video that surfaced this week. He said he planned to sell the girls into slavery. In a published interview Friday with Al-Hayat, a semiofficial Saudi newspaper, Saudi Grand Mufti Abdulaziz Bin Abdullah Al-Sheikh, a key religious leader in the Muslim world, condemned Boko Haram as a terrorist organization. He described it as an organization ""set up to smear the image of Islam"" and said the group is ""not right and misguided, because Islam is against kidnapping, murder and aggression."" Not enough troops to respond? The Amnesty International report alleges that after Nigerian commanders were informed of the pending attack, they were unable to raise enough troops to respond. A military contingent of between 15 and 17 soldiers and a handful of police officers in Chibok were unable to fend off as many as 200 Boko Haram fighters who stole the girls from their beds, the report says. The Nigerian government claims it responded with troops, helicopters and airplanes in the immediate aftermath of the mass abduction. ""It is a very painful period for all of us,"" Nigerian Defense Minister Musiliu Olatunde Obanikoro said. ""We've had sleepless nights trying to bring this to an end. Right now our primary concern is how that can be achieved and not disclose the details of where they are and whether they are in units or they are in one central location."" Nigerian officials have frequently been criticized for failing to prevent Boko Haram's deadly attacks, particularly in the terror group's stronghold of northeastern Nigeria. At least 2,000 people have died in violence in northern Nigeria this year alone, Amnesty said. The most recent Boko Haram attack killed at least 310 people in a town that had been used as a staging ground for troops searching for the missing girls.

"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- South Africans sang and prayed late Thursday outside the hospital where Nelson Mandela is being treated, singing ""Viva Mandela!"" after news the anti-apartheid icon's condition had stabilized. Colorfully dressed women danced in front of the Pretoria hospital where candles burned, the South African Press Association reported. Hundreds of people from the African National Congress Youth League and Women's League sang struggle songs, danced, and marched up and down the street in front of the hospital, according to the state-run South African Broadcasting Corp. ""There is no other like him,"" they sang. Zuma: Mandela's condition improves . Mandela's condition improved, President Jacob Zuma said Thursday, as the eyes of the nation remained fixed on his progress. Zuma spoke after visiting Mandela in the hospital and said the medical team told him the former president ""remains critical but is now stable."" ""I canceled my visit to Mozambique today so that I can see him and confer with the doctors. He is much better today than he was when I saw him last night,"" Zuma said. Mandela, 94, considered the founding father of South Africa's modern democracy, has been undergoing treatment at the Pretoria hospital since June 8 for a recurring lung infection. His oldest daughter said earlier that although her father is critically ill, he opens his eyes and responds to touch. ""I reiterate that Tata is very critical, that anything is imminent,"" Makaziwe Mandela told SABC. ""But I want to emphasize again that it's only God who knows when the time to go is. And so we will wait."" ""Tata"" is the word for father in the language of Mandela's Xhosa tribe. ""He's ... still reactive to touch. We will live with that hope until the final end comes,"" she said. The stream of family visits continued, with the former president's granddaughter Ndileka Mandela and grandson Mandla Mandela the latest to come to the hospital, the South African Press Association said. Concerned about rumors . Another grandson, Nkosi Mandela, issued a statement criticizing what he called ""hurtful"" and ""mischievous rumors"" about his grandfather's condition. ""Our government has been keeping all of us informed in this regard, and there is no reason to doubt the accuracy of the information they provide to the public,"" he said. ""At the end of the day, my grandfather's fate, like that of everyone else, lies with God and our ancestors,"" he added. ""However, many of us will continue to pray and hope for his recovery."" An official briefed on Mandela's condition said he was on life support late Wednesday. Government spokesman Mac Maharaj declined to comment on the report, citing doctor-patient confidentiality. Zuma's statement also warned against a rash of misleading reports about Mandela's condition. The ANC is organizing prayer sessions around the country ""where all South Africans can come together, hold hands and pray for Madiba, his family and medical team,"" it said in a statement Thursday. In South Africa, Mandela is most commonly referred to as Madiba, the name of the Thembu clan to which he belongs. It is a term of endearment and respect. 'We need you!' As the nation remained on edge, South Africans found solace in candlelight vigils. Police barricaded the street leading to the hospital's main entrance as crowds posted messages and left tributes at the hospital wall. ""We need you!"" one sign read. ""We love you tata, get well soon!"" said another. Police also cordoned off the street outside Mandela's Johannesburg home Thursday, the South African Press Association reported. About 30 journalists who were gathered outside were asked to move to the end of the street, but well-wishers were allowed to leave flowers and tributes by the house. 'A hero for the world' Mandela became an international figure while enduring 27 years in prison for fighting apartheid, the country's system of racial segregation. He was elected the nation's first black president in 1994, four years after he was freed. Even as he has faded from the spotlight, he remains popular and is considered a hero of democracy worldwide. He turns 95 next month. U.S. President Barack Obama, who is on a tour of the continent this week that includes South Africa, said his thoughts are with the nation's citizens. ""He is a personal hero, but I'm not unique in that regard,"" Obama told CNN Chief White House correspondent Jessica Yellin in Dakar, Senegal, the first stop of his African tour. ""I think he's a hero for the world, and if/when he passes, we know his legacy will linger on throughout the ages."" First lady Michelle Obama said Mandela ""is very much in our thoughts and prayers right now."" Speaking to middle-school students in Dakar, she urged the children to ""honor his legacy by leaving a proud legacy of your own."" ""If President Mandela could hold tight to his vision for his country's future during the 27 years he spent in prison, then surely you all can hold tight to your hopes for your own future,"" she said. ""If President Mandela could endure being confined to a tiny cell, being forced to perform back-breaking labor, being separated from the people he loved most in the world, then surely all of us, we can keep showing up and doing our best -- showing up for school each day, studying as hard as you possibly can."" Obama's schedule does not include a visit with the anti-apartheid icon.The president's trip to South Africa this weekend includes a stop on Robben Island, where Mandela spent a majority of his prison term. After South Africa, Obama plans to head to Tanzania, his last stop before returning to Washington.

"(CNN) -- For all of its expected action and drama, the new ""Halo 4"" boils down to an essential question: Are its central characters humans, machines or something in between? The answer may still be unclear by the time you're done playing this fantastic game. This edition of the hugely popular ""Halo"" franchise was developed by 343 Industries, which took over after Bungie Studios, creators of the first four games, split from Microsoft. To its credit, 343 Industries has retained the intense first-person shooter action ""Halo"" fans are used to but upped the emotional interplay between the iconic Master Chief and his artificial-intelligence companion, Cortana. The action begins with Master Chief in cryosleep and Cortana starting to undergo rampancy, a condition for older AIs in which they actually think themselves to death. At one point, Cortana likens it to having 1,000 arguments with herself, but she tries desperately to hang on to her sanity to help the Chief, her human ally. The connection between these two characters makes this campaign really special. From the opening scene with Catherine Halsey, the creator of the story's super-soldier program, to its climax, the tension between humans and machines runs throughout the story. Web series builds anticipation for 'Halo 4' Cortana seems more emotive than before -- a welcome addition to the character. Master Chief retains his detached, no-nonsense soldier persona for most of the campaign, but there are moments you want his helmet to come off so you can see the facial expressions you sense he's making. ""Halo 4"" hooked me emotionally before I realized it. Some scenes made me feel waves of despair or elation before I recognized I was mirroring the emotions in the game -- truly a sign of an immersive experience. The graphics of ""Halo 4"" are outstanding in their detailed depictions of characters and background environments. Whether foliage for a jungle setting or the individualized movement of little bits of wreckage, each scene is treated with careful attention to the smallest element. Characters look like live-action actors, and their movements and emotions have a realistic, almost filmlike quality. This technique has been used in other games, but ""Halo 4"" raises the bar for others to emulate. The voice acting and dialogue are fantastic and help pull you into the story. You'll quickly hate some characters based merely on the inflection in their voice. (You may even wish you could shoot them in the face -- I know I did -- but you can't.) The game introduces a new character from the recent ""Halo"" Web series, and I sometimes wondered if I was missing inside jokes from the related ""Halo"" books. But knowing the entire ""Halo"" universe isn't a prerequisite to enjoying this game. There are eight missions in the single-player campaign, with plenty of weapons and vehicles from which to choose. Combat in the game seemed more strategic than the straightforward, hard-charging style we've come to know from previous ""Halo"" titles. For example, using the armor's jump-pack accessory allows players to leap up to hidden spots and pick off enemies. And other armor abilities allow Master Chief to create a floating turret, which I found great for thinning out a battlefield before wading in. Don't worry, fans -- the big action sequences are still there. ""Halo 4's"" epic fight sequences require players to confront waves of enemies in one mission, then pick off bad guys one by one in another. And of course, co-op and online multiplayer action is available if you want to include a friend or try your luck against an opponent. Despite all the mayhem, what stood out for me about ""Halo 4"" was the story. The new developers made an effort to delve into the characters we've known over the years and morph them into something fresh. The ""man or machine"" question becomes more prevalent as the game progresses, and I found myself looking at different missions and scenes through that lens. Is Cortana more human as her mind begins to splinter? Does John-117, the solder we know as Master Chief, become a robotic killing machine? Or have both influenced each other so much that the differences we expect between the two become mixed, creating a symbiotic relationship that only becomes evident when one side lets down the other? During one tense scene, Master Chief tells Cortana, ""I was supposed to protect you."" She replies, ""We were supposed to protect each other."" The deepening interactions between these two main characters enhance the narrative and make ""Halo 4"" a wonderful new addition to a beloved franchise -- and the best ""Halo"" campaign so far. It keeps me wanting to play over and over again. ""Halo 4"" is available now throughout most of the world and will be available Thursday in Japan as an Xbox 360 exclusive title. It is rated M for mature due to blood and violence. Online interactions are not rated. This review was done with a provided limited edition copy and is solely focused on the single-player campaign.","""Halo 4"" is a wonderful new addition to a beloved franchise -- and the best ""Halo"" yet .

"San Francisco (CNN) -- Google has a simple and inexpensive new way to stream Internet videos on your TV. The company on Wednesday introduced Chromecast, a small device that lets you stream content to your television over a WI-Fi network, using your computer, phone or tablet as a remote control. The company said its goal is to create a device with zero setup time, no learning curve, and one that works with all platforms and devices. The $35 Chromecast is a radically different approach to TV than Google's previous failed attempt, the Nexus Q. It's smaller, cheaper and available starting today. The two-inch dongle looks like a thumb drive and pops into the HDMI port on an HDTV. It turns your phone, tablet or computer into a remote. Choose what content you'd like to stream and the Chromecast will play it on a nearby TV. ""The television is missing in the (streaming-video) picture. it is really, really difficult to get your online videos on the television,"" said Sundar Pichai, Google's senior vice president of Android, Chrome and apps, at Wednesday's press event. Google unveils upgraded Nexus 7 tablet . Chromecast supports both Android and iOS devices. At its event, Google demonstrated the device using a Windows laptop and an iPhone. Chromecast also is streaming directly from your Wi-Fi connection, so it's not draining your device's battery. That means you can multi-task, checking e-mail on your computer, tablet or phone while a custom YouTube playlist broadcasts on your TV. The device currently only streams content from YouTube, Google Play and Netflix, though more apps, such as Pandora, are expected in the future. A beta feature lets you stream any tab directly from a Chrome browser running on one of your non-TV devices. With Chromecast, Google is seeking a foothold in a small but growing field. Only 15% of households have figured out how to watch online video on their TV sets, according to Google. The device goes head-to-head with existing Internet-on-TV solutions like Apple TV or the Roku box. The Chromecast stick is on sale now in the Google Play store and at electronics retailers such as Best Buy, although it may not ship immediately.

"(CNN) -- He's kerpowed the Joker and put the Penguin on ice, but Batman faces a new adversary -- the mayor of an oil-producing Turkish town. The late Heath Ledger plays the Joker in ""The Dark Knight,"" the most successful film of the year.

""We found this criticism right and started to look for legal possibilities of a case like that,"" Hurriyet Daily News.com reported. Batman, which has a population of just under 250,000, is the provincial capital of the oil-rich Batman Province and lies close to the Batman River. In recent years it has been hit by a series of female suicides and features in the novel ""Snow"" by Nobel prize-winner Orhan Pamuk. ""The Dark Knight"" movie is based on the Batman comic-book character created in 1939 by Bob Kane.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- After wreaking damage on the Philippines and claiming at least 64 lives over Tuesday and Wednesday, a newly intensified Typhoon Rammasun is bearing down on Hainan and Guangdong provinces in southern China. The storm, which was downgraded as it passed over the Philippines, gained strength again over the South China Sea and is now battering Hainan, with its inner eye wall hugging the island's coast. Now categorized by the China Meteorological Administration as a super typhoon, Rammasun made landfall on the island province of Hainan at around 1:30 p.m. (1:30 a.m ET) Friday after veering westwards. The weather agency issued a 'red' typhoon warning, the highest of four color-coded warning levels. It is the first time this year the signal has been raised. Authorities in the region are on high alert. Prior to the storm's reaching Hainan, a bulletin stated its intensity will be 50-55 meters per second (180-200 km/h or 112-123 mph). Super typhoons are categorized as having sustained winds of 150 mph (241 km/h) or higher. Should Rammasun hit the mainland as expected, the storm is expected to produce strong gales that may top 93 mph (150 km/h), heavy rain and tidal surges. Given the rapid escalation in the storm's strength, it is unclear how comprehensive preparations for this storm have been in the areas likely to be affected the most. Shipping in the region has been suspended, as have some flights, including in Hainan, which is a popular holiday destination. Trains in Guangdong bound for Hainan have been halted in the provincial capital Guangzhou, and Hainan's high-speed railway has also had operations suspended, according to China's state-run news agency. China's National Meteorological Center also said inland areas of some provinces, including Yunnan, Hubei and Henan would experience rainstorms. The NMC warned of flooding in cities and landslides in mountain areas. The typhoon caused at least 64 deaths in the Philippines, as well as damage to property and infrastructure across Luzon, the largest island in the archipelago, according to the Philippines News Agency, citing of Office of Civil Defense. The agency said most victims were struck by falling trees or other debris. At least 103 injuries were reported and five people reported missing. The typhoon damaged more than 26,000 houses -- about 7,000 of those destroyed, the agency said. James Reynolds, a freelance journalist and videographer who was in Legazpi when the typhoon made landfall in the Philippines, said in a twitter post that Rammasun looked ""immensely powerful -- one of the strongest I've seen in the (South) China Sea for a long time."" Only two other super typhoons have ever hit China, Saomai in 2006 and Marge in 1973. Saomai, registered as a once-a-century typhoon, was the most powerful typhoon ever to have made landfall over mainland China. This storm, says CNN's Ivan Cabrera, could top both of these. The existing typhoon record of 78.9 m/s was observed at Dalaoshan, Hong Kong, on 1 September 1962 .","First red-level warning typhoon of the year bears down on southern China .

"(CNN) -- While the gaming world is focused on the new Xbox One from Microsoft, Activision is deploying its most popular franchise, ""Call of Duty,"" for its first assault on the next generation of consoles. Developer Infinity Ward has designed new game-engine technology to take advantage of Sony's PlayStation 4 and the new Microsoft console, both due by year's end. Its ""Call of Duty: Ghosts"" will come to PC, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 gamers this November 5, with next-gen release dates coming later. In a recent interview in Los Angeles, Activision Publishing CEO Eric Hirshberg showed off what next-generation gaming will mean within the new ""Call of Duty"" game. Rather than continuing the ""Modern Warfare"" storyline, the development studio decided to start from scratch with a new story and new characters. ""Ghosts"" sets players in an alternate-future America that's been crippled by a government in disarray. The Ghosts are remnants of the various branches of the Special Forces. They've adopted the best fighting techniques from these branches as they battle across an array of terrains and environments. Also new to the franchise is an interactive dog, which the developers created with the latest performance-capture technology. The dog promises to be a loyal and important companion throughout the game's campaign. This being a ""Call of Duty"" game, there will also be new multiplayer gameplay to entice players to log in and take on friends from around the world on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network. ""Call of Duty: Ghosts"" adds dynamic maps, including natural events such as floods and earthquakes and player-activated obstacles such as doors and explosive traps. We sat down with Hirshberg to talk about what opportunities next-gen consoles will open up for gamers. Here's an edited version of our interview: . CNN: What will define what next-generation gaming is this fall? Hirshberg: It's interesting. If you look into what's happened in culture, not just in gaming but overall in culture over the last seven years that this current gen has represented, the way that we communicate, the way that we consume entertainment, the way that we connect socially through digital spheres has completely transformed during that exact time period. The current-gen games like ""Call of Duty"" had something to do with that. They were the tip of the sword. Playing multiplayer in ""Call of Duty"" is probably one of the first mass things that people did together in a digital environment. Now we do almost everything together in a digital environment. All of those ways to connect with the devices in your pockets and being able to comment on everything, categorize everything and rank everything, hasn't really made its way into gaming yet. We were ahead of the curve a little bit with ""Call of Duty: Elite,"" which we came out with to try to create a more social experience. One of the things you're going to see with next gen is that with ""Elite,"" we were working around the current-gen limitations in order to make a meaningful connection to the game itself. We had to find our way through an obstacle course technologically to make that happen. Next gen is being designed with that in mind. There's really a baked-in connectivity to the next-gen hardware, the way it's being conceived, that I think will create many more opportunities for social connectivity surrounding video games. CNN: What will that mean to the community of ""Call of Duty"" gamers out there? Hirshberg: We're seeing 40 million people a month playing ""Call of Duty."" Six million people played today. This is 175 days after the launch of the last game. Anything that that many people do and care about, usually there's a whole ecosystem of content to service their interest in that hobby. They don't just watch a football game. They have a fantasy sports league. They have their favorite highlight shows. They have blogs that they read. They have statistics that they view online. They're connecting with that thing on multiple devices, multiple times a day, seven days a week, not just when there's a football game on. With gaming, it's pretty much either you're playing the game or you're not playing the game, and I think that with next gen you're going to see that ecosystem spread to different devices, different times a day, with a lot more supportive entertainment content for our franchises. CNN: When you look at past transitions to new consoles, the focus has been on improved visual fidelity. Hirshberg: You're going to see that, too. But to be fair, last time it wasn't just graphical fidelity. It was the introduction of connected machines. It was the introduction of multiplayer through Playstation Network and Xbox Live. Games like ""Call of Duty"" took that and ran with it, and there's a certain amount of humility we all need to have. No one will see the future exactly accurately, but the creation of those connected networks with the last generation of hardware created an explosion of new games with multiplayer and that's become the primary way people are spending their hours gaming. Next gen is always a combination of hardware design and ... what developers and creative minds do with that hardware. I'm just looking at the main differences and theorizing that that's where you're going to see an explosion of new creativity. CNN: What role do you feel ""Call of Duty"" will play in enticing gamers to upgrade to next gen? Hirshberg: The game needs to be great, but when you have a brand of the scale of ""Call of Duty"" that's so popular and so massive that it has the capacity to be one of the things that people really want to see. If you look at the last console transition, the top franchises were the ones that bridged the gap between the last gen and the current gen, and I think that will happen again. We can't take that for granted and assume that people will show up just because it's a ""Call of Duty."" It has to be a major game, and it has to be demonstrative and emblematic of everything that the next gen is capable of and that's why we're putting this level of investment against it. That's why we're not taking the easy route in doing a sequel to ""Modern Warfare."" That's why we're opening up the franchise and removing the restrictions and doing all new characters and an all new world and taking a whole new approach to the game. We want to set the standard for the next gen. CNN: What are the challenges when it comes to this transition? ""Call of Duty: Ghosts"" is also coming out on next gen, but the majority of gamers will be playing on current generation of consoles. Hirshberg: One of the decisions we made early on, which was not a simple decision, but we think it was the right one, is that we have the same exact team developing the game for the current gen as is developing for the next gen. Some publishers have a lead developer doing the next-gen game and then some outsourcing for the current gen. We felt like it was really important to deliver what I think will be the best current-gen ""Call of Duty"" ever because that game's going to benefit from all of the new thinking and all of the new ideas that are going into the next gen. Some of the things from a technological standpoint won't be executable on the current gen, like the Sub D and the texture mapping and that stuff, but all of the gameplay ideas like dynamic maps, character customization, the new story, the new world; the current gen will be the beneficiary of all of those new ideas. I think it's going to be the best current-gen game we've ever made. CNN: Traditionally, with new hardware comes lower price points for current gen. How much life there is in the current-gen systems moving forward, given that PlayStation 2 had a very long tail? Hirshberg: I try to not predict these things. What I know is we're going to have great games on every platform wherever our audience is. This has been Activision's philosophy for a long time. We've always been platform agnostic. Wherever there are gamers that want to have a great experience, we're going to have a great ""Call of Duty"" game for them; we're going to have a great ""Skylanders"" game for them. Even if the next gen is off to the races on Day One, there will still be a lot of people who either are waiting to see or saving their money and who aren't going to dive in right away, and we want them to have a great experience, too.","""Call of Duty: Ghosts"" will go on sale November 5 .

"(CNN) -- When I was in seventh grade, my grandmother informed our extended family that I was a pervert. Mind you, I was as squeaky clean in thought and deed as you'd expect a badly permed, brace-faced, Catholic school spelling bee winner would be, but that didn't mean I wasn't curious about a few things. I'd often give my bedroom over to visiting relatives, and this time, my grandmother had decided on a little light reading -- in this case, my copy of Judy Blume's ""Then Again, Maybe I Won't."" It might seem downright quaint in this age of instantly accessible porn and e-book readers, but an awful lot of ladies who came of age in the '70s and '80s and into the '90s got a significant chunk of our sex education from young adult books. More specifically, they were paperback books with cracked spines, decoy paper covers and pages dog-eared at the juicy bits. These weren't even necessarily acts of depraved, wildebeestly humping and sexytime (V.C. Andrews novels aside) but rather some thoroughly non-judgmental plot points about the gross, weird, lusty wonder of puberty and adolescence. In the pre-Amazon era, it was nearly impossible to just sidle into the local bookstore or library and nab one without fear of being branded a slut or a skank -- labels that both intrigued and confused us, and which we hurled with ignorant abandon. We relied on someone's cool aunt, older sister or slightly oblivious mom to get the goods and coordinated their circulation with military precision: ""OK, Lisa gets 'Deenie' tonight, and she'll hand off 'Forever' to Jenny B., who will give 'Up in Seth's Room' to Jenny P."" Woe was the girl who got caught flipping through the contraband in class, though. All blame and shame was on her, and it was understood that she'd have to get another copy into rotation. Because we were starving then, aching for information and affirmation that the feelings and odd body hairs were nothing out of the ordinary. Ordinary is all we wanted to be. A brief history of young adult literature . Judy Blume's Margaret Simon taught us the musts of bust expansion exercises and menstruation, while Deenie Fenner explored her ""special place"" during shower time. (Confession: It was years before I realized she was talking about masturbation, and I thought she had a ticklish spot in her underarm like I did.) Blume's Tony Miglione (of the grandma-scandalizing ""Then Again ..."") had his first wet dreams and found increasingly baroque ways to hide his boners, and the much-banned virginity-busting ""Forever"" gave a generation of women a reason to giggle every time they met a man named Ralph. Though Blume was the captain of the genre, plenty of other authors chummed the waters of teen girls' curiosity about sex, often bumping up against boundaries of shame and fear. We were grateful to have those maps. For me, that book that broke through was Bette Greene's ""Morning is a Long Time Coming,"" the sequel to her classic ""Summer of My German Soldier."" By eighth grade, I was roughly aware of the mechanics of the act, thanks to a bare-bones and thoroughly grudging syllabus laid out by my local Catholic diocese, teaching essentially: Don't, and shame on you for even thinking about it without a wedding ring on your finger. It was a relief and a revelation to see Greene's protagonist, Patty Bergen, echo that struggle. She met a handsome young Frenchman, thought for a hot second about the preachers who'd made her feel like a filthy sinner all her untouched life and opted for pleasure over guilt. Though it would be some years until I came to that particular crossroads in my own life, having sex celebrated, rather than demonized, by an author I'd come to trust was tremendously freeing. Washington-based writer Carol Blymire found a guidepost in ""Go Ask Alice,"" the ""anonymous diary"" of a drug-addicted runaway (later revealed to be the fictional work of novelist Beatrice Sparks), and veered from the course. ""I grew up in a family that didn't talk about sex. Ever,"" Blymire wrote in an e-mail. ""Everything I learned about boys and sex, I learned from my older girl cousins, friends, friends' moms, and books."" One Sunday morning in sixth grade, Blymire swiped her older cousin's copy of the book after hearing her go on and on about how cool it was. ""The drug stuff was way over my head. Didn't bother me, didn't scare me. The sex parts were totally intriguing, because she seemed so disconnected to it all. Having read 'Forever' around that same time, where it was all about Katherine and Michael's love, the main character in 'Go Ask Alice' seemed a little more like me -- weird, immature, not the kind of girl boys were interested in,"" Blymire wrote. ""It made me think that sex was, at some point, something I was going to do -- just to get it over with to see what it was like, and then decide if I was ever going to have it again or just be done with it. That it would be that easy to be disconnected from emotion. ""I'm glad I was wrong,"" Blymire concluded. The new names on the banned book list . And for all the care and caution of Blume, Greene and even ""Anonymous,"" there was the lurid, creepy abandon of V.C. Andrews' 1979 ""Flowers in the Attic."" There's no polite way to describe the plot, so I'll just rip off the bandage. For various complicated reasons, four siblings (two older and two younger) are kept locked in an attic by their wealthy, sadistic grandmother, who slowly poisons them with arsenic-powdered doughnuts. The two eldest eventually do what a healthy, normal, well-adjusted brother and sister would never even dream of doing: they begin a sexual relationship. Yes, it's as disturbing as it sounds, an icky emulsion of lust, taboo, sexual violence and moral fervor. It's also sold more than 40 million copies worldwide and spawned multiple sequels, a theatrical release and a made-for-television version that will air on the Lifetime network on Saturday. It was the single hottest ticket on the underground book swap when I was a freshman in high school. We were not alone in this; many smart explorations have been made on the topic of ""Flowers'"" intense appeal to adolescent girls (though it was never strictly marketed to them). But if I had to venture a guess, I'd say it's the one-two whammy of hormones and horror. First, the overheated soap-opera plotting gave otherwise shy, book-loving girls an excuse to to talk to one another on a ""literary"" level (eventually getting down to the nitty gritty) and bond in a way they might never over ""Call of the Wild."" Second, and perhaps even more significant, is the sharp relief into which it threw any real-life palpitations they might be experiencing. Made out with your lab partner under the bleachers or wondering if over-the-sweater is a base too far? At least you're not sleeping with your brother. San Francisco-based author Stephanie V.W. Lucianovic found the descriptions of the couplings so disturbing, she admits it might have caused her to hang on to her virginity than she might have otherwise. The phrase from the novel that Lucianovic said was ""quite the bucket of cold water on my teenage ardor"" is (ahem): ""It drove into my tight resisting flesh, which tore and bled."" In a written exchange, she admitted to some confusion, saying she ""initially thought (for some reason) that it was her thigh flesh that tore and bled ... but then I realized what it really meant. Either way, it made sex seem scary and painful and while I knew I wasn't going to get raped by a brother while living in an attic surrounded by tempting arsenic-laced doughnuts, I carried with me the belief that sex (when it happened) was bound to be painful."" Painful or not, because of these battered, dog-eared, passed-around volumes, none of us had to go through the mess of adolescence solo. We had Margaret, Deenie, Patty, Tony, Anonymous and even ol' Ralph alongside us to make us feel a little more normal in a hormone-frenzied world. And I find these days, reminiscing with women my age, that I have an urge to reunite with these fictional friends again. Maybe I will. Which YA books were you reading while nobody was looking?

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The possible sale of the L.A. Clippers appeared to have hit a contractual snag, but it quickly got unsnagged. Donald Sterling's lawyer is going on vacation, so the probate court deciding whether or not he gets to keep the team or his wife gets to sell it, postponed the next hearing until July 21. That goes against a stipulation in former Microsoft chief Steve Ballmer's agreement with Shelly Sterling to buy the Clippers for $2 billion, according to a court filing. The NBA was supposed to meet on July 15 to approve the sale, but only if the court had made a decision by then. No NBA decision, no sale? Not so, contends Ballmer's lawyer Adam Streisand. As long as the trial is moving forward, the sale deadline can be extended by 30 days. Court theatrics . An angry Donald Sterling lashed out at the NBA in a court hearing Wednesday, calling the league ""a terrible institution"" that told lies and wrongly made him a ""poster boy"" for racism. The 80-year-old billionaire and co-owner of the Clippers had taken the stand in the nonjury trial in probate court. He is battling his estranged wife Shelly Sterling over how she had him declared mentally unfit and then took over the couple's trust that owns the basketball team, which she's trying to sell for a record $2 billion. He was animated and, at times, visibly upset -- this time under questioning from his own lawyer. Sterling challenged the idea that he couldn't run the Clippers, insisting that ""to say someone else could take over is ludicrous."" He added that he still runs five corporations. ""I know everything,"" Sterling said. Started with racist comments . Donald Sterling came under fire earlier this year for making racist comments to his companion V. Stiviano that appeared online; others felt he dug an even deeper hole during an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper in which he disparaged basketball legend Magic Johnson and others. On Wednesday, he blasted the NBA as ""the worst corporation in America,"" saying he would never willingly sell the team and that he would fight the league in court as long as it takes. ""I will never, ever, ever sell this team,"" Sterling said. ""And until I did, I will be suing the NBA."" On Tuesday, Sterling tearfully said his wife, though beautiful and intelligent, just can't run their business empire. On the stand Wednesday, he said Shelly Sterling was pressured by the NBA to force a sale of the team. ""She was scared out of her mind,"" Donald Sterling said. Shelly Sterling: ""I started crying"" Later Wednesday, Shelly Sterling took the stand. She said she was moved to act -- including to get Donald Sterling evaluated by doctors, to assess his mental capacity and thus his ability to run the family trust that owns the Clippers -- after seeing his interview with Cooper. ""I couldn't believe it,"" she said, recalling watching that interview. ""I started crying. I felt so bad. I couldn't believe it was him. I didn't know what was wrong."" Shelly Sterling said her husband didn't seem to have a problem when he was later examined by doctors. But as she left the stand and walked toward him, Donald Sterling made his feelings loud and clear by yelling: ""Get away from me, you pig."" He then appeared to mutter under his breath, ""Shelly, how could you lie?"" Shelly Sterling's lawyer then asked Judge Michael Levanas to have Donald Sterling removed from court. The judge didn't comply, instead asking the Clippers co-owner not to ""make any statements to your wife."" Doctors say Sterling has Alzheimer's or another brain disease . Donald and Shelly Sterling were ordered by the NBA to sell the basketball franchise after Donald Sterling was heard making racial slurs against African-Americans in an audio recording. She took over the trust in which the couple equally own the Clippers after she sent him to two physicians who certified he was mentally incapacitated. Donald Sterling, an attorney and real estate investor, has early Alzheimer's or another brain disease, the doctors said. But Donald Sterling and his attorneys dispute he's incapacitated. Levanas is hearing evidence on whether Shelly Sterling acted properly when she removed her husband from the couple's trust. The judge said he is not deciding on Donald Sterling's mental capacity. Rather, the judge is going to rule only on issues of the trust and whether its procedures were followed correctly. Donald Sterling has said he believes the team may be worth twice the $2 billion price his wife negotiated with Ballmer, said Maxwell Blecher, another attorney for Donald Sterling. Donald Sterling's mental capacity not issue for trial . New doctor declares Sterling mentally fit . Who is Steve Ballmer? CNN's Linda Hal and Sara Sidner reported from Los Angeles, CNN's Greg Botelho wrote this story from Atlanta.

"(CNN) -- Google rolled out a new Nexus 7 tablet on Wednesday. But a much smaller, much cheaper new gadget may be the one that makes a seismic impact in the consumer technology world. Chromecast is a glorified thumb drive that enables Web streaming to television. At $35, it's also practically free, considering that it comes packed with three free months of Netflix. Streaming media onto the (relatively) big screen is nothing new. Set-top boxes like Roku and Boxee have provided the service, at least in part, for years. More recently, Google's now-defunct Nexus Q has battled Apple TV for the hearts and minds of consumers who have grown used to on-demand video on their laptops, tablets and even phones. With Chromecast, though, Google appears to have stripped down Web streaming to its purest elements. ""It looks like they have learned from their mistakes, and radically simplified the experience,"" Janko Roettgers wrote for tech blog GigaOM. ""Gone are the attempts to integrate existing pay-TV offerings, recruit app developers for yet another medium and ship devices with hideous, complicated remote controls. ""Instead, Chromecast is pure simplicity: Search and discovery of video content is happening on the mobile device or laptop, and all Chromecast does is stream media from the cloud."" Google and Apple have both tried and, at least so far, largely failed to make inroads into the living room with streaming TV products. Google TV struggled to get some major content providers to play ball. And Apple CEO Tim Cook has acknowledged that Apple TV has languished as more of a novelty for diehard fans than a mass-market success. (A full-on Apple TV set, which has been the tech world's most-anticipated piece of rumored vaporware for the past couple of years, could of course change that). Those products, along with Roku, Boxee and the like, have been, in a way, similar to traditional TV. Approved ""channels,"" chiefly Netflix, Amazon and other Web video services, are available. But Chromecast takes streaming to a whole new level -- offering a quick, simple version of what tech-inclined folks have been able to accomplish by rigging up their laptops or desktops with their TVs. Essentially, if you can watch it on a computer, tablet or phone screen, you'll be able to watch it on your TV. That's the logical end goal of Web streaming, and many analysts are saying Google struck a huge blow by being the first to offer it up in a way that the typical consumer can understand and use. ""By coming out early at an extremely affordable price, Google may wind up dominating the TV delivery industry,"" consumer tech analyst Larry Magid wrote for Forbes. ""It's hard to imagine that Hulu, Major League Baseball, HBO Go and every other content provider isn't beating a path to their door. I imagine that the TV networks, too, are anxious to get their content on the device."" Early interest in the 2-inch gadget appears to be high. Thursday afternoon, Chromecast was listed as out of stock on Amazon and Best Buy's website. The Google Play store was accepting orders, saying the device would be shipped in 3-4 weeks. While deals with the TV networks seem inevitable, Chromecast also could allow Google to make deals directly with content providers, in much the way Netflix has with original programs like Emmy-nominated ""House of Cards"" and a revived ""Arrested Development."" Web TV services like Hulu have thus far tried to limit their basic service to computer screens, offering the ability to stream to television for extra money. Now, Hulu says it's working with Google to offer an ""optimized"" version on Chromecast. How Chromecast will impact Google's battle with Apple remains to be seen. The existing Apple TV product, with its Airplay feature that streams from the Web, has its devotees. But it only works with Apple products, naturally. Chromecast is designed to work on any platform that can run its Chrome browser. So a user could, for example, stream a YouTube video from an iPad, then watch a Netflix movie from a PC -- all streamed on a TV set through a Google device. ""On paper at least, it's the best device Google has ever announced ...,"" Mat Honan wrote for WIRED, a CNN.com content partner. ""Did Google just win the living room? No. But it definitely just cozied up on a lot of couches and got comfortable.""","Google's Chromecast could be a TV game changer, analysts say .
The Web streaming device costs $35 and plugs into TVs .
Its simplicity is the key, some say .
How Chromecast will affect the TV battle with Apple remains to be seen ."
"(CNN) -- When players get their hands on ""Grand Theft Auto V"" on Tuesday, the gaming world will get another titillating dose of the sex and violence that has come to define the series in the eyes of millions -- many of whom have never played it. Early reviews of the game confirm a checklist of activities from any good criminal's daily planner: bong hits and lap dances, torture and tasers. They also herald the return of what The New York Times called ""the most immersive spectacle in interactive entertainment."" And in a world that's learned to take ""Call of Duty"" and Quentin Tarantino in stride, it's a combination some predict could result in the most lucrative entertainment launch in history. ""GTA is easily one of the biggest game releases of the year,"" said Steve Butts, editor-in-chief of games and entertainment site IGN.com. ""The previous game is still one of the biggest entertainment launches of all time, and there's no reason to think GTA V will be any different."" Launched in 1997, the ""Grand Theft Auto"" series is one of the most successful in video-game history, selling more than 125 million units. Along the way, the series has transcended the gaming world to become a cultural phenomenon through its rare mix of popularity and controversy. Samuel L. Jackson, Dennis Hopper, Ricky Gervais, Peter Fonda and Debbie Harry are among the voice actors who have lent their talents to the series. Flipping the script on the typical good-versus-evil story, gamers play ""Grand Theft Auto"" titles as criminals -- from two-bit hoodlums trying to work their way up the ranks of organized crime to seasoned, rough customers hell-bent on revenge for wrongs done to them by other crooks. Much of the franchise's appeal is its status as an ""open world"" game. While most video games, even those with story lines attached, keep the player busy on a predetermined course of action, open-world games allow greater freedom to explore. And while games with some open-world elements date back to the video arcades of the '80s, none had ever combined as many as the ""Grand Theft"" series, creating an immersive experience for players of its 10 titles and numerous expansion packs. Want to work out? Hit a night club? Get a job? Change the radio station on your car stereo? All are possibilities. But there's no denying that, for some players, the ability to do very nefarious things in that open universe has also been a draw. The game's big breakout among players, as well as critics, came in 2001 with ""Grand Theft Auto III."" Perhaps the most notorious discovery in that version, set in a New York-like ""Liberty City,"" was the player's ability to hire a prostitute, have (offscreen) sex with her, kill her and then steal her money. The now-defunct GameSpy named ""GTA III"" both ""Game of the Year"" and ""Most Offensive Game of the Year."" ""I think this is a technically marvelous game that at the same time is absolutely reprehensible ...,"" the site's most-offensive ""honor"" read. ""It's a game that rewards you for killing innocent people by the dozen. In Grand Theft Auto 3, I can hijack a car, kill the driver, run someone down on the street, commit drive-by shootings, and score points for doing all of it. ""In some scripted sequences, I'm tasked to kill people at random. In one, the identities of the victims don't even matter. The goal is merely to kill a certain amount of people within the allotted time. There are no significant penalties for offing bystanders."" The game was briefly banned in Australia and a modified version was later released. Other bans, protests and even lawsuits would follow. But IGN's Butts says that's not why the games have endured. ""The more salacious content definitely gets headlines -- and undoubtedly resonates with some members of the audience -- but the real appeal of GTA has always been in its open-ended world,"" he said. ""Here's a game where you exist in a simulation of a real city, a sort of real-world sandbox, where you can play golf, race cars, jump out of airplanes, fly blimps and loads of other activities. ""While those activities, by themselves, are fun, the real joy is in seeing the way the world responds to your actions and decisions. The combat and driving are obviously significant draws for some players, but they're not what most set GTA apart."" Controversies over violent video games feel almost as old as video games themselves, dating back to the 1980s. Perhaps that's why the din leading up to the release of ""GTA V"" hasn't been so loud. Which is not to say controversy has gone away. As recently as last month, authorities in Lousiana said an 8-year-old had been playing ""Grand Theft Auto IV"" before he shot and killed his elderly caregiver. (Age 8, it's worth mentioning, is far too young to be playing the game according to its ""M for Mature"" rating.) The sheriff's office implied the child's activities in a violent virtual world might have led to the killing. But Butts and others see a cultural shift that's taking the edge off of complaints.

"San Francisco (CNN) -- Calling it ""the biggest change to iOS since the introduction of the iPhone,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook on Monday unveiled an operating system for iPhones and iPads that will radically overhaul how users' touchscreens look. The new system, iOS 7, was part of a two-hour presentation that included refreshed MacBook Airs, the announcement of an iTunes Radio streaming-music service and a sneak peek at a new Mac Pro that will be the most powerful computer Apple has ever made. The keynote, kicking off Apple's annual Worldwide Developer's Conference, marked Apple's first major product event in nine months. But it was short on blockbuster launches or surprises -- no TV, no smartwatch and no upgrades to marquee products like the iPhone and iPad. Some pundits griped about a lack of groundbreaking hardware or features at a time when Apple is facing a stock-price slump, increasing competition from rivals like Samsung and a gnawing perception that the giant computer company is not as bold or as cool as it was under Steve Jobs, its late CEO and co-founder. Instead, developers assembled for the weeklong conference got the first look at a major reworking of Apple's mobile operating system, due this fall. iOS is home to more than 900,000 apps that collectively have earned independent developers $10 billion, according to Apple. The mobile design, overseen for the first time by new iOS boss Jony Ive, includes new typography, redesigned icons and a new color palette. ""I think there is a profound and enduring beauty in simplicity, in clarity, in efficiency,"" Ive said in a video introducting iOS 7. ""True simplicity is derived from so much more than just the absence of clutter and ornamentation. It's about bringing order to complexity."" Immediately noticeable: The pool-table green background on Game Center was gone. ""We just completely ran out of green felt,"" joked Craig Federighi, Apple's vice president for software engineering. In fact, virtually every recognizable app shown in a brief presentation looked considerably different from its iOS 6 counterpart. Animations float by in the background of the Weather app, while Calendar is now minimalist in black and white. But it's not just a redesign. Federighi demoed new features like Control Center, where users will be able to swipe up for music, flashlight and other tools. Airdrop, Apple's file-sharing software, comes to mobile with iOS 7, and the Photos app has been upgraded with such features as Instagram-like photo filters and photo albums that can be created by year or location. Siri, Apple's voice-activated ""digital assistant,"" is becoming more diverse. Users will be able to choose a male voice -- Siri has been solely a ""she"" so far -- and users can ask it to perform basic tasks like playing a voicemail or turning down the brightness on an iPhone or iPad's screen. iOS 7 became available in beta to developers on the iPhone Monday, but the rest of us will have to wait until the fall. It will work only on iPhone 4 or later, iPad 2 and later, the mini and the iPod touch. Also coming this fall is iTunes Radio, a free streaming service that sounds a lot like Pandora or Spotify. iTunes Radio will include over 200 programmed channels, plus others inspired by music the user already listens to. The service will be ad-supported and will encourage users to buy songs they like from iTunes. However, iTunes Radio joins a crowded streaming-music landscape -- Google launched a similar service last month -- and several analysts criticized it as a rare example of Apple playing catchup to its rivals instead of creating something new. Also Monday, Apple introduced revamped MacBook Airs with ""all-day battery life"" and offered a peek at the most powerful computer the company has ever made. Apple Senior Vice President Phil Schiller provided a peek at the new Mac Pro, a desktop that is Apple's fastest computer. In a teaser video, the new Pro looked like a shiny cylinder and, according to Schiller, will double the performance of the current model, launched three years ago. ""Can't innovate any more, my ass,"" Schiller told the audience in a jab at analysts who have said Apple is being surpassed by companies like Samsung and Google in the rollout of bold new products. The new Pro will be released this year and will be designed and assembled in the United States, Schiller said . The 11-inch version of the MacBook Air will go from five hours to nine hours of battery life, Schiller said, while the 13-inch version will go from seven hours up to 12. Schiller said the new models will have faster Wi-Fi connections and faster graphic loads. They began shipping Monday, with the 11-inch Air beginning at $999 and the 13-inch starting at $1,099 (that's a $100 break on the 13-inch). In a departure, Apple's next Mac operating system will not be named after a cat. Instead, the 10th iteration of OS X will be called Mavericks, named for a popular surfing spot in northern California. (Previous version names have included Mountain Lion, Snow Leopard, Tiger, Lion and Cheetah.) Among the system's new features will be Maps, previously a mobile-only product, and iBooks, which will let users read books they buy from the App Store on multiple devices. Other features demoed by Federighi included color-coded tags, a multidisplay setup for more than one screen and integration with Apple TV. He said internal tweaks have been made to make the system faster and to conserve battery life. The new system will be available in the fall. In opening the keynote, Cook noted that the company's online App Store has served up 50 billion downloads in its five years of existence. He said there are 900,000 apps in the store, 375,000 of which were designed for the iPad. ""Just a few hundred from those other guys,"" he said, in an apparent swipe at rival tablets that run Google's Android system and others. He also said the App Store has 575 million accounts, ""more accounts with credit cards than any store on the Internet that we're aware of.""","Apple rolls out MacBook Airs with an ""all-day battery""

"(CNN) -- A young woman steals her way down darkened passages in Korogocho -- one of Kenya's largest slums. Crime, prostitution and drug use are rampant in the locality where a quarter of a million people reside and the young woman's eyes dart around erratically on the lookout for danger. It should be one of the happiest days of her life -- she is pregnant and has just gone into labor. She is also one of the fortunate few that can afford to go to hospital. Some women face a homebirth where, instead of medical equipment, they must make do with cotton wool and razorblades. But the journey to hospital leaves her vulnerable to opportunistic assault. For Aggrey Otieno, a human rights activist, this scenario is exactly what he is trying to prevent. A facilitator of social change, he has dedicated his life to improving the living conditions -- especially for women and children -- in the Kenyan slum where he spent his childhood. ""Korogocho has been in the news for all the bad things ... HIV/AIDS is very rampant. People who do drugs are here. People who do prostitution are here,"" says Otieno. ""It is our responsibility who stay in the slum, to bring the change that we want."" Read this: African midwife, Nobel Peace Prize? In his mission to help the area where he grew up, Otieno established Pambazuka Mashinani, -- meaning ""grassroots awakening"" in Swahili -- with an ethos of empowering ""urban poor in Nairobi slums."" After being granted a scholarship through the Ford Foundation, Otieno attended Ohio University in the United States, receiving a Masters degree in communications and development and a diploma in African community health. Using these learned skills, Otieno returned to Kenya to begin passing on his knowledge and start Pambazuka Mashinani. ""So many people in this community look up to me -- in fact I think I am the most educated person here because I have a Masters degree,"" he says. ""Because of that, I feel I have to really give back to this community."" He adds: ""It is out of that I am trying to bring other people together to save lives in Korogocho."" Otieno's organization now has a number of programs including reproductive health, research and advocacy, youth and women's empowerment. One of the most widespread obstacles for women in the slum is the fact that most cannot afford healthcare so part of Otieno's mission is to bring healthcare directly to them in the form of support groups with trained professionals. ""(Local people) get trained on a number of topics -- like today's topic is on breast feeding ... when you support them, they end up supporting their children and the whole community and they end up being empowered. ""I believe by empowering one woman, I have empowered so many communities."" In addition to community education workshops, Otieno has also set up a network of 24-hour mobile medical units called telemedicine centers, which provide assistance for pregnant women from afar via text messages and, where necessary, vans are sent to pick up women from the slums and take them to a local hospital. ""We are making use of simple technology to save lives in the community -- through some laptops and computers,"" says Otieno. ""We have integrated them with software installed in health facilities around Korogocho and we also have mobile phone texting technology. ""What we have done is come up with some software to link the front-line health workers that are supporting us -- these people have mobile phones and they visit pregnant women in their homes -- and at the moment they see complications, they send text messages to the telemedicine center."" Doctors then review the text messages and provide analysis and support for pregnancy-related matters. ""Eight percent of Kenyans -- regardless if you are poor -- own a mobile phone. People do a lot of texting. It is very cheap for you to text ... so that really inspired me."" One doctor on the end of a mobile phone is Peter Muguma who greatly admires the work Otieno has done to lower maternal mortality rates in Korogocho. ""So many women are dying during delivery, dying during pregnancy,"" says Muguma. ""In the slums it is due to poverty, lack of awareness, transport."" ""We get a text message on our computer. This tells us the mother is sick or in labor and then I make arrangements for (an) ambulance or for someone to pick her up and take her to hospital ... When you save a life a lot of satisfaction comes out of that,"" adds Muguma. Otieno takes a lot of pride in what he is doing to change the lives of those in Korogocho, saying that facilitating social change at the grassroots level can have a ripple effect for years to come. ""I have seen my friends going through prostitution, drugs and a lot of my friends are criminals that were my classmates,"" he says. ""I am offering myself that you can also live here and be the change you want to be and at the same time you can be a role model that they can look up to so they can bring change in the community.""","Aggrey Otieno grew up in one of Kenya's poorest slums .

"(CNN) -- The new iPhone 5S's performance upgrades and 64-bit processing chip will make the smartphone more responsive and faster. And mobile game developers are excited about the possibilities they see opening up with that newfound power. Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice president for marketing, said the new A7 chip has tested up to twice as fast as the iPhone 5's processor. It is also the first 64-bit chip in a smartphone -- an announcement that caused some developers to smile. Perhaps it was no coincidence that during the Cupertino event on Tuesday, a mobile game was the first demonstration after the iPhone 5S was announced. ""Infinity Blade III,"" developed by ChAIR Entertainment and the final entry in the series, will launch on September 18 and was designed with the new A7 chip in mind. Technical director Geremy Mustard said the new power in the iPhone 5S has allowed his team to craft the ultimate ""Infinity Blade"" experience. ""With the unmatched power of the iPhone 5S and its A7 chip, we can now combine full-screen rendering effects, tons of polygons, and advanced gameplay processing in one smooth package,"" he said. ""And we are able to do all that with almost instantaneous load times, keeping gamers immersed in the experience instead of staring at a loading screen."" Creative director Donald Mustard believes mobile gaming will get another giant push forward with the phone's new technology, calling it ""true next-gen gaming"" on a device that fits in your pocket. ""The iPhone 5S allows us to have a huge, extremely detailed dragon spewing billowing flames that engulf the entire screen, while the hero, clad in armor that reflects the environment, swipes to defeat the beast,"" he explained. ""We're rendering a full depth of field blur and bloom pass, a color adjust pass, a vignette pass, and a distortion pass ... while maintaining a blazing frame rate."" ""It sounds like voodoo magic -- but it's not."" The new chip with 64-bit capabilities and improved graphics has developers salivating. But other features could open the door for different types of mobile gaming. ""The 64-bit architecture, combined with the improved processor specs, has the potential to offer supercharged graphic performance that will enable more immersive experiences,"" said Ross Dixon, executive producer at XMG. ""Combined with the A7 chip, and the upgraded camera, the motion coprocessor may also open up new opportunities for innovative gameplay that makes use of augmented reality and geolocation information."" Both Donald and Geremy said they did not have early access to iOS 7 or the new iPhone 5S when they were building ""Infinity Blade III,"" but they design their games with future tech in mind. So when they were presented with the new operating system and device, they were blown away by how many features they could turn on and still have a great game. But all that comes at a power cost, right? ""We are constantly pushing the devices to the limits,"" Donald said. ""The Apple team historically has used 'Infinity Blade' as their internal benchmark. We don't know how long you'll be able to play on the new phone, but on the iPhone 5, I could game on a flight from Salt Lake to New York ... about 5 or 6 hours."" Schiller said during the Apple reveal event that the battery life would be ""the same or better"" than the iPhone 5. Changes to the interface will also present opportunities for mobile game developers. The new ""parallax effect"" included in iOS 7 will create depth on what has traditionally been a flat display for the iPhone and game controller support will offer a new way to play games on the go with the smartphone. ""Important to gamers and game developers, the new interface provides a better game-playing experience,"" said Kabam CEO Kevin Chou. ""The new controller puts Apple at the forefront of bridging the ever-shrinking gap between consoles and iOS devices."" Expect game controller makers to roll out a cornucopia of controllers after the iPhones are released later this year, but it may take some time. Developers are looking at all aspects of the new operating system. ""iOS 7 opens up some great opportunities for us,"" said Justin Swan, lead designer of ""Trials Frontier."" ""Of course native controller support is really interesting for the types of games we are making, but new features like Airdrop and more ways to compete through Game Center could really pump up the highly competitive aspect of our games."" Mobile gaming will definitely get a boost from the new technology available to developers. Games should be deeper, richer and more interactive -- something only seen before on console platforms. With 700 million iPhones in the gaming marketplace and the addition of the new hardware inside, developers think this very well could be mobile gaming's time to make a dent with the noncasual gaming audience. ""For the first time we can imagine adapting our console game development knowledge for mobile devices without sacrificing a lot in the process."" Brice Ramard, mobile technical director for Ubisoft, said. ""With the (motion-sensing) M7 chip, we'll have the opportunity to look into bringing more movement-based games to iOS users,"" added Cyril Derouineau, CCO & CTO of Mobile for Ubisoft. Donald Mustard said the younger generation is growing up with mobile devices and they are the ones who are going to spur the mobile gaming proliferation in terms of quality and power. ""I really think it is going to be hard for (home) consoles to compete with the console (smartphone) I've got in my pocket especially as we move forward.""","A 64-bit chip could make gaming more intense on new iPhone 5S .

"(CNN) -- It captivated millions of people around the world for eight days in the summer of 1969. It brought glory to the embattled U.S. space program and inspired beliefs that anything was possible. Moon landing hoax theorists point to the ""rippling"" flag as evidence the landings were faked. It's arguably the greatest technological feat of the 20th century. And to some, it was all a lie. Forty years after Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin set foot on the moon, a small cult of conspiracy theorists maintains the historic event -- and the five subsequent Apollo moon landings -- were staged. These people believe NASA fabricated the landings to trump their Soviet rivals and fulfill President Kennedy's goal of ferrying humans safely to and from the moon by the end of the 1960s. ""I do know the moon landings were faked,"" said crusading filmmaker Bart Sibrel, whose aggressive interview tactics once provoked Aldrin to punch him in the face. ""I'd bet my life on it."" Sibrel may seem crazy, but he has company. A 1999 Gallup poll found that a scant 6 percent of Americans doubted the Apollo 11 moon landing happened, and there is anecdotal evidence that the ranks of such conspiracy theorists, fueled by innuendo-filled documentaries and the Internet, are growing. Twenty-five percent of respondents to a survey in the British magazine Engineering & Technology said they do not believe humans landed on the moon. A handful of Web sites and blogs circulate suspicions about NASA's ""hoax."" And a Google search this week for ""Apollo moon landing hoax"" yielded more than 1.5 billion results. ""We love conspiracies,"" said Roger Launius, a senior curator at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington. ""Going to the moon is hard to understand. And it's easier for some people to accept the answer that, 'Well, maybe we didn't go to the moon.' A lot of it is naivete."" Conspiracy theories about the Apollo missions began not long after the last astronaut returned from the moon in 1972. Bill Kaysing, a technical writer for Rocketdyne, which built rocket engines for NASA's Apollo program, published a 1974 book, ""We Never Went to the Moon: America's Thirty Billion Dollar Swindle."" In the book and elsewhere, Kaysing argued that NASA lacked the technology in 1969 to land humans safely on the moon, that the Apollo astronauts would have been poisoned by passing through the Van Allen radiation belts that ring the Earth and that NASA's photos from the moon contained suspicious anomalies.  See improved NASA footage of the 1969 moonwalk » . Kaysing theorized NASA sent the Apollo 11 astronauts up in a rocket until it was out of sight, then transferred the lunar capsule and its three passengers to a military cargo plane that dropped the capsule eight days later in the Pacific, where it was recovered. In the meantime, he believed, NASA officials filmed the ""moon landing"" at Area 51, the high-security military base in the Nevada desert, and brainwashed the astronauts to ensure their cooperation. Some believe Kaysing's theories inspired the 1978 movie ""Capricorn One,"" in which NASA fakes a Mars landing on a remote military base, then goes to desperate lengths to cover it up. Others insist NASA recruited director Stanley Kubrick, hot off ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" to film the ""faked"" moon landings. Oh, and those moon rocks? Lunar meteorites from Antarctica. Decades later, Kaysing's beliefs formed the foundation for ""Conspiracy Theory: Did We Land on the Moon?"" a sensational 2001 Fox TV documentary that spotted eerie ""inconsistencies"" in NASA's Apollo images and TV footage. Among them: no blast craters are visible under the landing modules; shadows intersect instead of running parallel, suggesting the presence of an unnatural light source; and a planted American flag appears to ripple in a breeze although there's no wind on the moon. The hour-long special sparked such interest in the topic that NASA took the unusual step of issuing a news release and posting a point-by-point rebuttal on its Web site. The press release began: ""Yes. Astronauts did land on the moon."" In various documents, NASA has countered that the Apollo astronauts passed through the Van Allen belts too quickly to be exposed to dangerous levels of radiation; that the module's descent engines weren't powerful enough to leave a blast crater; that the shadows in photos were distorted by wide-angle lenses and sloping lunar terrain; and that the Apollo flags had horizontal support bars that made the flags swing. Kaysing died in 2005, but not before grabbing the attention of Sibrel, a Nashville, Tennessee, filmmaker who has since become the most visible proponent of the Apollo hoax theories. With funding from an anonymous donor, Sibrel wrote and directed a 47-minute documentary in 2001 that reiterated many of the now-familiar hoax arguments. Critics of moon-landing hoax theorists, and there are many, say it would be impossible for tens of thousands of NASA employees and Apollo contractors to keep such a whopping secret for almost four decades. But Sibrel believes the Apollo program was so compartmentalized that only its astronauts and a handful of high-level NASA officials knew the entire story. Sibrel spent years ambushing Apollo astronauts and insisting they swear on a Bible before his cameras that they walked on the moon. ""When someone has gotten away with a crime, in my opinion, they deserve to be ambushed,"" Sibrel said. ""I'm a journalist trying to get at the truth."" In an episode made infamous on YouTube, Sibrel confronted Aldrin in 2002 and called him ""a coward, a liar and a thief."" Aldrin, then 72, socked the thirtysomething Sibrel in the face, knocking him backwards. ""I don't want to call attention to the individuals who are trying to promote and shuffle off this hoax on people,"" Aldrin told CNN in a recent interview. ""I feel sorry for the gullible people who're going to go along with them. I guess it's just natural human reaction to want to be a part of 'knowing something that somebody doesn't know.' But it's misguided. It's just a shame."" It's been 37 years since the last Apollo moon mission, and tens of millions of younger Americans have no memories of watching the moon landings live. A 2005-2006 poll by Mary Lynne Dittmar, a space consultant based in Houston, Texas, found that more than a quarter of Americans 18 to 25 expressed some doubt that humans set foot on the moon. ""As the number of people who were not yet born at the time of the Apollo program increases, the number of questions [about the moon landings] also may increase,"" NASA said in a statement. ""Conspiracy theories are always difficult to refute because of the impossibility of proving a negative."" Launius, the National Air and Space Museum curator, believes Apollo conspiracy theories resonate with people who are disengaged from society and distrustful of government. He also believes their numbers are overblown. ""These diehards are really vocal, but they're really tiny,"" he said. But Stuart Robbins, a Ph.D. candidate in astrophysics at the University of Colorado who gives lectures defending NASA from Apollo hoax theorists, believes their influence can be harmful. ""If people don't think we were able to go to the moon, then they don't believe in the ingenuity of human achievement,"" he said. ""Going to the moon and returning astronauts safely back to Earth is arguably one of the most profound achievements in human history, and so when people simply believe it was a hoax, they lose out on that shared experience and doubt what humans can do."" In its information campaign against Apollo's ""debunkers,"" NASA may have a potent ace up its sleeve, however. Its Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter is now circling the moon with powerful cameras, snapping crisp pictures that could reveal Apollo 11's Eagle lander squatting on the moon's surface. Then again, conspiracy theorists may just say NASA doctored the photos. ""Will the LRO's incredibly high-resolution images of the lunar surface, including, eventually, the Apollo landing sites, finally quell the lunacy of the Moon Hoax believers? Obviously it won't,"" writes astronomer Phil Plait in his blog on Discover magazine's Web site. ""These true believers don't live in an evidence-based world.""","A cult of conspiracy theorists believe NASA faked the Apollo moon landings .

"(CNN) -- ""The Maze Runner"" ran away with the weekend box office, ringing up the best debut since early August. The post-apocalyptic action flick, based on James Dashner's novel of the same name, cruised to victory with an estimated $32.5 million debut. In the world of young adult fiction turned Hollywood fodder, that's closer to a mega-hit like ""The Hunger Games"" than a flameout like ""The Mortal Instruments."" In ""The Maze Runner,"" Dylan O'Brien stars as the newcomer among a group of teens trapped in a mysterious glade, unsure why they're there or how to navigate the massive, menacing maze that appears to be their only way out. The film's strong opening should help restore some of the faith in YA novel adaptations after the recent weak performance of ""The Giver."" In fact, since the ""Maze"" novel is part of a trilogy -- and since the movie nearly made back its $34 million production budget in just three days -- it was no surprise when Fox announced plans for a sequel before the weekend even ended. ""The Maze Runner: Scorch Trials"" is scheduled to hit theaters September 18, 2015. Opening in a sluggish second this weekend was R-rated thriller ""A Walk Among the Tombstones,"" starring AARP action hero Liam Neeson as an alcoholic former detective turned unlicensed private investigator. Its lukewarm total of $13.1 million was still enough to hold off the weekend's other new wide release, ""This Is Where I Leave You,"" which stars Jason Bateman, Tina Fey and Jane Fonda as a dysfunctional family reunited by a funeral. After a month and a half, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" finally fell out of the box office top five, but it didn't go far: It landed in sixth place, with total domestic ticket sales now at $313 million, and $632 million in worldwide grosses. Look for the ""Guardians"" sequel in 2017. On a less successful note, writer/director Kevin Smith's comic horror tale ""Tusk"" managed to pull in just $886,000 after opening in 600 theaters. Justin Long stars as a smarmy podcaster who, while searching for stories, heads to Canada, where a man takes him prisoner and begins turning him into a walrus. Yes, you read that correctly. Domestic weekend box office estimates are from Exhibitor Relations Co. (final numbers arrive Monday afternoon): . 1. ""The Maze Runner"" -- $32.5 million . 2. ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" -- $13.1 million . 3. ""This Is Where I Leave You"" -- $11.9 million . 4. ""No Good Deed"" -- $10.2 million ($40.1 million in 10 days) 5.

"(CNN) -- A brand new story, make-your-own levels and authentic voices make ""Little Big Planet 2"" (Media Molecule, Sony) a worthy successor to its 2008 social hit and puzzle-platforming predecessor. Media Molecule, the team that developed ""Little Big Planet,"" takes another crack at opening the imagination of players with new challenges, weapons and rides. The hero, Sackboy (or Sackgirl, depending on the gender you choose), returns to tackle a single-player story that has a plot, supporting characters and villains. In ""LBP,"" players took their Sack avatar through different levels, based on real-world locations. In ""LBP2,"" the world has been overrun by the forces of evil and destruction, and Sackboy is recruited by the Alliance, a group that wants to restore goodness, and cupcakes, to everyone. The first thing I noticed in the single-player actions was the voices created by real actors. During gameplay in ""LBP,"" characters just muttered or grunted while speech bubbles spelled out what they were saying. Now, the nonplayer characters' voices lend extra atmosphere to the scenes. Sackboy still bounds through an obstacle course of physical challenges. He gets some new tools, such as gloves that help him lift and toss large items, and a grappling hook that shoots out to get him over and around larger chasms. The object is the same as the first game: Collect point bubbles and materials to dress up your Sackboy or the surrounding scenery with stickers. The action is whimsical, with a dash of British humor, and there are some laugh-out-loud references if you pay attention. The additional fun comes from making your own levels. Indeed, Alex Evans, one of the co-founders of Media Molecule and technical director on ""LBP2,"" said that players from the first game wanted more options to be able to share their own creations with others. ""It was the number one request of the first game,"" Evans said. ""It was, 'Oh, I spent the weekend making a shrine to my cat. How do I advertise it? How do I reach an audience?' "" Evans said they created a feature in the game that creates a URL for each level players make, so they can put it on Facebook or Twitter or in an e-mail. In this way, gamers' amazing levels are seen by a wider audience and hopefully inspire others to do the same. ""What we were amazed at the first time around was that there was actually really good content,"" Evans said. ""So we definitely learned a lot, and we've got a lot more recommendations to guide [players] to those levels that are likely to appeal to you."" Those who want to create will find new tools and tricks to make their imagination come to life much easier. Evans said these tools have been used in creative ways that developers never imagined. ""I've always been so pleasantly surprised by not patronizing gamers,"" he said. ""There is this untapped potential of the community that never ceases to amaze me in a very good way."" Most of the original creations from ""LBP"" were what Evans called ""homages"" to other role-playing games or classic platforming games. With the addition of new tools like the Create-a-nator, which lets Sackboy make whatever he needs to solve a puzzle, new community levels are expected to be more expansive and imaginative. There are also vehicles in ""LBP2"" that have their own abilities and powers. Sackboy can ride a bouncing puppy with a sonic bark, or a multi-humped camel that shoots missiles out of his mouth. It is also backward-compatible, meaning that anything that was created in the first game will play just as nicely in ""Little Big Planet 2."" Any Sackboy creation, including all materials and clothing, will automatically be loaded in ""LBP2."" Overall, the new single-player story with real voice acting and nonplayer characters is a welcome change from a simple physics-engine platformer. While the story is as old as time, the action and the humor are fun, exciting and an excellent way to learn all the game's new tools and tricks. The community (at the time of this review, it was filled with levels created by beta players) has a wide array of selections, from first-person zombie shooters to driving games to traditional platforming games. Media Molecule also has an area that recommends levels it likes. Media Molecule really hit home with ""Little Big Planet 2."" The only way you won't enjoy this game is if you can't imagine having fun.","""LBP2"" boasts authentic human voice acting, lending atmosphere to its scenes .

"(CNN) -- When the highly anticipated ""BioShock: Infinite"" hits stores on Tuesday, a naive 19-year-old with special powers and book smarts -- but little true grasp of the complexities of the world around her -- will meet a gaming public that's been awaiting her debut for years. Elizabeth may be the most talked-about video game character who's not controlled by the player since ""Portal's"" wry, sarcastic killing machine, GlaDOS. Her creators were so concerned about getting her just right that she almost never happened. ""When I first started working on her, she was horribly broken. There was a lot of internal opposition to her,"" said Amanda Jeffrey, a designer with Irrational Games, the publisher behind the wildly inventive ""Bioshock"" franchise. ""Almost everyone in the office was saying out loud, 'We should just cut her.' How on Earth do you begin to deal with this (type of) character who nobody has had any experience with?"" Enter the Liz Squad. So devoted was Irrational to creating a companion character like none other that they built an entire team of developers from different areas of the company with the sole purpose of making Elizabeth ""real."" ""Once the creation of Liz Squad became official, we had what was called The Liz Hammer,"" Jeffries said. ""If Liz Squad, or Elizabeth herself, needed something from the development team, then she got what she needed."" In the game's story line, the teen Elizabeth has the ability to change the world around her. But she's also been locked away from the rest of that world since birth. As Booker DeWitt, a former Pinkerton agent, the player must rescue, or kidnap, Elizabeth away from her predicament. The game portrays their journey together from a futuristic city in the sky into the post-Victorian world of 1912. Building off the successes of ""BioShock"" and ""BioShock 2,"" creative director Ken Levine wanted to further ramp up the player's emotional involvement in the game. ""We kept coming back to having a partner in the experience and as we looked out onto the field of partners that existed (in other games), the air gets pretty thin,"" Levine said. ""We wanted a character that would be absolutely central to the narrative. In video-game terms, that meant creating someone the player would connect with emotionally but who would also be useful to them during gameplay. ""The biggest challenge of this entire game wasn't the skylines and it wasn't the open world,"" said writer Drew Holmes. ""It was making her real because she is the game. If she doesn't work, everything else we've been shooing for is meaningless."" The realistic look and feel of Elizabeth didn't fully come together until within the last year. But gamers who already loved the expansive, altered-reality world of the series first met her in 2011 at the Electronic Entertainment Expo, the world's largest video-game gathering. Levine said that demo of the game showed what Elizabeth could do from a narrative standpoint, but that he still wasn't comfortable with how she behaved. He postponed the game from its original release date of March 2012 several times, specifically because Elizabeth wasn't right. ""She's the extension of what we were trying to do with the Big Daddy, which is more to me about an emotional resonance than a combat experience,"" Levine said. He was referencing characters from ""BioShock"" who are painted as both deadly monsters and loving companions to the ""Little Sisters"" they protect. ""What made the Big Daddy work was the emotional impact it had on the player. Same with Elizabeth. The goal was emotional."" It seems to be working. When Elizabeth was again revealed to the world in videos displaying her personality and emotional range, she was an instant hit. Fans and players clamored for more and seemed to form a bond with the wayward young girl. So much so, in fact, that when later videos showed Liz in different clothing or with a different hairstyle, the outcry over the changes was swift and harsh. The Liz Squad took that as a sign their work was on the right track. ""The fact that people are already so concerned about what Elizabeth is doing, how she's reacting, what she's wearing is just incredibly powerful,"" Jeffrey said. ""If nobody cared, it would just be a horrible place to be."" Emotional resonance aside, animation director Sean Robertson said the toughest thing to make Elizabeth look and move like a real person was her dress -- which comes with a long, flowing skirt that originally wouldn't behave. ""You don't see a lot of companion characters wearing dresses -- at least not of the non-miniskirt variety,"" Robertson said. ""Liz's character is important as she is a character of the time and women wore dresses then. We put a lot of work into the physics of the dress so it behaves correctly, the way it needs to and doesn't put her in any embarrassing positions."" While Robertson struggled with a dress, Holmes, the writer, said his greatest task was making gamers ultimately care as much about the teen companion as her creators did. ""She was the hardest thing we could have possibly tried to do,"" he said. ""It's one thing to get her in the game and get her to move around the world. It was another to then breathe life into her."" ""BioShock Infinite"" will be released worldwide on Tuesday, March 26, and be available on the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Windows PC. It is rated M for Mature due to blood and gore, intense violence, language, mild sexual themes, and use of alcohol and tobacco.","Elizabeth, a troubled 19-year-old, is the emotional centerpiece of ""BioShock Infinite""

"(CNN) -- The big hardware unveil at Monday's Apple press event was the new Mac Pro, a sleek cylindrical desktop computer and the most powerful machine Apple has ever built. It was the announcement that prompted Apple executive Phil Schiller to exclaim, ""Can't innovate anymore, my ass."" It also costs thousands of dollars and is way more machine than most people will ever need. The Mac Pro is aimed at a narrow market of professionals such as photographers, videographers, designers and animators. Since the line was first announced in 2006, the Pro has received relatively few upgrades compared to the rest of Apple's product line. The company has been busy focusing on its hit consumer and mobile devices, leaving many professionals wondering if they were being left behind. For people using the desktop computers in their businesses, the external look of a Mac is often secondary. So periodic internal improvements to the old tower design were enough to keep them satiated. Others had already abandoned the Pro line as the iMac and MacBook Pro became powerful enough to meet their photo- and video-production needs. For the remaining power users, reaction to the new Mac Pro is mixed. And the future of the computer, which is 2.5 times faster than the current model, is still unclear. CNNMoney: Apple's ultimate Mac is bizarre and beautiful . First things first: The new Pro is a design marvel compared to its clunky predecessor -- a sleek, black cylinder that bears little resemblance to computers as we've traditionally imagined them. It's smaller and cannot be expanded and customized as much as the previous system. Apple has built a machine so unique that people who want to add to it will end up building out, adding components like hard drives and PCI cards externally. To make that expansion possible, the industry must first embrace the Thunderbolt input-output standard. For example, it's no longer possible to pop in standard video cards. Mac Pro users will have to either get cards that fit the custom shape of the new computer or plug them into the computer using a Thunderbolt 2 connection. ""It's either going to change the way computers are built, or it will fall by the wayside,"" said Tony Welch, the creative services director at the Beyond Pix production studio. Welch is excited about the new product and hopes to upgrade his studio's systems, but he hopes Apple's ""risky"" bet to depend heavily on Thunderbolt for expansion pushes the companies that make hard drives, PCI cards and other peripherals to support the connection technology. But Chris Layhe of CLAi, a San Francisco post-production studio, is less impressed. ""Basically, it's two Mac Minis tied together in a cylinder,"" he said. ""It's a load of rubbish. The things that we need in the film and video business, everything's dependent on cards."" Apple adding ""kill switch"" to iPhones . Users of the new Mac Pro may want to stray outside Apple's closed system. Layhe, who has been shooting and editing film for 28 years, has seven Macs at his company. He is in the process of building a ""hackintosh"" -- a custom PC that uses the same cards and boards found in a Mac that can run Mac software, but has more USB slots and can take additional cards. These unofficial systems can cost as little as $1,500 to build. ""We don't want to switch to PC because a lot of the software we use is Mac only, and we've been Mac users for a long, long time,"" said Layhe, adding that all his backups and stored video are Mac compatible. Launched in 2006, the Mac Pro is one of Apple's priciest products, starting at $2,499 for the most basic setup. Many creatives who need to squeeze the maximum amount of power out of their machines get custom Mac Pro configurations, which can go as high as $12,000, not including monitors or accessories. A price hasn't been announced for the new Mac Pro. Monday's unveiling was just an early preview, and the computer won't be available until later this year. Pro users are a small part of Apple's business. Only 19% of the company's revenue in the first quarter of this year came from Macs. That's just shy of the 21% it made selling iPads and a far cry from the 49% it made on the iPhone. When Mac Pros were struggling, it was creatives who gave the brand some of its respectability and a cool factor. For now, they are enjoying a rare bit of attention from Apple and hoping for the best. ""We're all glad that they came out with a Pro tower at all,"" Welch said. ""I think we were all fearful that they would abandon the pro community.""

"(CNN) -- Edward Snowden is hoping to stay in Russia a little, or perhaps a lot, longer. The former National Security Agency whistleblower, who leaked secret information about U.S. spying programs, has formally requested that Russia's government extend his temporary asylum, Russian state news reported Wednesday. The asylum request was filed with the Moscow branch of the Federal Migration Service, said Snowden attorney Anatoly Kucherena, according to state-run Itar-Tass and RIA Novosti. As to how long Snowden might extend his stay, RIA Novosti reported that Kucherena said, ""We won't say yet in what status we would like to receive the extension because that decision is up to the Federal [Migration] Service."" Kucherena noted that Snowden's temporary asylum in Russia ends on July 31. He'd been holed up at a Moscow airport for five weeks before the Russian government granted asylum for one year on August 1. Since that time, Snowden has kept busy working for a Russian website and speaking out about the disclosures about the U.S. government's spying programs and processes that he helped make public. Snowden's disclosures in 2013 made him in an icon among those who praised him for risking his future to expose these secrets and a villain among those who accused him of being a lawbreaker who betrayed the United States. The former government information technology contractor collected information on spy programs -- in which the NSA mined phone and Internet metadata from thousands of people inside and outside of the United States -- and exposed the programs to the media. U.S. authorities have charged him with espionage and theft of government property. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton commented on Snowden's case in an interview this week with the German magazine Der Spiegel. ""I think he is a poor messenger for the message that he's trying to take credit for,"" she told the magazine. ""I think he could have provoked the debate in our country without stealing and distributing material that was government property and was of some consequence,"" Clinton said.

"Karachi, Pakistan (CNN) -- Clashes at Pakistan's largest and busiest airport left more than 20 people dead after militants armed with grenades stormed into a cargo area Sunday. Violence erupted at Jinnah International Airport in Karachi around 11:30 p.m. Sunday and raged on for more than five hours as security forces fought off attackers, leaving some passengers trapped inside the airport. Officials at Jinnah Hospital said the dead included eight members of airport security forces, two Pakistan International Airlines employees and one ranger. All ten militants involved in the attack were killed, military spokesman Maj. Gen. Asim Bajwa said. Two of them detonated suicide vests, he said. The attack ended Monday morning, and the airport is under military control, he said. It was not immediately clear who the militants were or why they staged the assault. Clashes broke out after attackers armed with grenades stormed the airport through three entrances, said Ahmad Chinoy, director-general of the citizen's police liaison committee. One militant blew himself up in front of an armored car, leaving some people inside the vehicle critically injured, Chinoy said. A plume of smoke rose over the airport as fires raged in at least two locations. Dozens of ambulances were lined up as police and military troops swarmed the area. A building caught fire in the attack, but no planes were damaged, Bajwa said. The airport's cargo area is about a kilometer (0.62 miles) away from the area where commercial planes take off. Bajwa said the militants were contained in a maintenance area of the airport. ""All passengers in planes evacuated to safer places,"" he said in a Twitter post during the clashes. ""Hunt for terrorists on."" Hours later, officials said the attack had ended and the airport was under the military's control. All flights at the airport were canceled as the violence unfolded. In a Twitter post, Bajwa said the airport would be cleared to resume operations by midday. Several days ago, Pakistan's government had warned provincial officials of a possible ""high-profile attack on a sensitive or key installation,"" but the warning did not mention the airport, said Qaim Ali Shah, chief minister of Sindh province. Earlier Sunday, at least 22 people were killed in twin suicide bomb attacks in Taftan, Pakistan, near the country's border with Iran. Quetta Police Commissioner Qambar Dashti said no one had claimed responsibility for those attacks, which hit a hotel housing Shia pilgrims.

"(CNN) -- Controversy continues to swirl around New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez -- including his relationship with a generous Democratic donor whose plane he took to the Dominican Republic and who has business ties in that Caribbean nation. Menendez first came under scrutiny shortly before Election Day last fall, when a conservative online publication cited three unidentified sources who claimed the senator had flown on private planes to the Caribbean and during the trip had sex parties with prostitutes. Menendez denied those claims and was easily re-elected. Questions revolve around his relationship with Salomon Melgen, the Florida man who owned a plane Menendez admits having flown three times -- once on official Senate business, and twice for personal reasons -- to the Dominican Republic in 2010. Melgen, his wife, Flor, and his daughter, Melissa, have been generous donors to Menendez, his fellow Democrats and related causes in recent years. Since 1998, the three South Florida residents have given at least $360,000 to candidates and groups such as the Democratic National Committee and the New Jersey Democratic State Committee, according to data on the Federal Election Commission's website. This does not include the $600,000 that Melgen's then company, Vitreo Retinal Consultants, donated to the left-leaning Majority PAC last election cycle, reports the OpenSecrets.org website run by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Now, Melgen himself is feeling the heat. Already hit by the Internal Revenue Service in 2011 with an $11 million tax lien, FBI agents arrived at the Melgen Retina Eye Center in West Palm Beach -- formerly called the Vitreo Retinal Consultants Eye Center -- after dark Tuesday to execute a search warrant. The search, which lasted well into Wednesday, was sparked in part by the appearance of a shredding truck on the property, said a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation. Agents from the FBI and U.S. Health and Human Services Department left the offices carrying box after box of material. An FBI spokesman in Florida has confirmed there was ""law enforcement activity"" at the location, but did not elaborate or mention any person specifically. Melgen's lawyer denies wrongdoing by his client. ""The government has not informed Dr. Melgen what concerns it may have,"" Dean L. Willbur Jr. told CNN on Thursday, adding that the doctor's issues with the IRS ""have been fully resolved."" ""We are confident that Dr. Melgen has acted appropriately at all times,"" said Willbur. Sen. Johnny Isakson, a Georgia Republican and member of his chamber's ethics committee, acknowledged Friday that his office is ""aware of the news reports regarding the FBI raid on Dr. Melgen's office."" Menendez's spokeswoman, Patricia Enright, has said the New Jersey senator assumes the committee is reviewing the entire matter, but he has not been contacted. ""The Ethics Committee will follow its established procedures on this matter,"" Isakson said. Menendez calls Melgen, who according to his official biography graduated from the Dominican Republic's National University and has been honored by its government, a friend and political supporter. Melgen and his family have frequently contributed to the New Jersey senator's causes -- contributing thousands to his campaigns, not to mention the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee he led from 2009 to 2011. Menendez, set to become chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is already facing questions over his travel on Melgen's plane. He has said the 2010 Caribbean trips, which took place in 2010, were ""paid for and reported appropriately,"" though his spokeswoman Enright admits it was an ""oversight"" for Menendez to take until January 4 of this year to pay $58,500 from his personal funds for two of the flights. Another issue has to do with whether Menendez advocated on behalf of ICSSI -- a port security company that Melgen has a stake in -- on Capitol Hill. During a Senate subcommittee hearing last July, Menendez didn't mention ICSSI by name, but he did press Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Matthew Rooney about an unnamed company who had a contract to X-ray cargo that went through all Dominican ports -- a contract that, he said, Dominican authorities ""don't want to live by."" ""If those countries can get away with that, they will,"" the senator said. ""And that puts American companies at a tremendous disadvantage."" Reached Friday, Menendez's chief of staff Dan O'Brien -- while not mentioning any company specifically -- proudly noted his boss's advocacy ""for more attention to the spread of narco-trafficking throughout Central America and the Caribbean."" ""Stemming the growth of narco-trafficking is a key challenge in the region, and it is a fight from which Sen. Menendez will never back down,"" O'Brien said. Not everyone supports ICSSI's contract in the Caribbean nation, as constituted. Foes include the American Chamber of Commerce of the Dominican Republic, a trade organization representing about 2,500 American and Dominican companies. The group said that while it doesn't oppose ""increased security measures ... we oppose the contract as conceived"" -- claiming it gives ICSSI a ""monopoly (in) violation of the Dominican constitution."" ""They are not what we believe they should be, and they violate all sorts of international treaties,"" said the chamber, which further claims ICSSI's rates are exorbitant. ""The ICSSI contract undermines national competitiveness, and there is no added value to it."" CNN's Jim Acosta, Greg Botelho, Adriana Hauser, Susan Candiotti and Ross Levitt contributed to this report.","Federal agents raid the office of a Florida doctor who has given to Democratic causes .

"Washington (CNN) -- Three days after Aaron Alexis walked into the Washington Navy Yard and randomly shot and killed 12 people, a congressional push for tougher gun laws still seems unlikely to materialize like it did following the the Newtown school massacre. But as more details emerge of Alexis' troubled past, lawmakers appear to be reframing the debate over gun violence, this time with emphasis on better treatment for mental health. The exasperated gun control debate takes a turn . After the December shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary school and a Colorado movie theater massacre the previous July that resulted in an insanity plea by the shooter, lawmakers and advocates on both sides of the gun debate called for improved mental health services. But those calls were drowned out by the more emotional and better-funded debate over gun control. Now, Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-New Hampshire, wants to re-introduce a mental health measure that had overwhelming support across party lines earlier this year. Co-authored by Sen. Mark Begich, D-Alaska, the legislation calls for more training and familiarity with services in schools and communities. The measure was added as an amendment to the broader gun control package in the Senate earlier this year, and while the chamber approved Ayotte's amendment by a wide margin, 95-2, the overall package failed. The mental health legislation went nowhere. Now she's trying to bring it back without attaching it to gun control bills. ""I actually think it can be taken up separately and easily passed,"" she said on CNN, pointing to the strong support the measure received in April. ""Very little gets 90 votes around here."" Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, also suggested a mental health bill can stand alone. ""I think we ought to move,"" Schiff said on MSNBC. ""The gun issue has been so difficult. I think we ought to try to move forward with whatever pieces we can."" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, said he still favors legislation for enhanced background checks but believes the mental health initiative should be the ""centerpiece"" in any new effort to stop gun violence. Dampening the hope of gun control advocates, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid told reporters in the aftermath of this week's Navy Yard slaughter that the votes aren't there to bring back the failed gun control legislation. Pressed on whether he'd consider a narrower version that strictly focuses on mental health, Reid simply said he ""would hope it would have the votes."" ""And I would be willing to do that,"" he continued. ""Anything we can do to focus attention on these senseless killings that take place."" Mental health as common ground . The most avid control advocates are still poised to push ahead with their agenda. Mayors Against Illegal Guns held a rally Thursday on Capitol Hill — an event scheduled before Monday's shooting — to keep pressure on lawmakers over expanded background checks. But as the investigation of Alexis continues, the conversation is largely focused on red flags from his history that were seemingly overlooked. Alexis had recently made contact with two Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals for apparent psychological issues and had exhibited signs of mental problems, CNN has learned. His father said he suffered from post-traumatic stress after working in 9/11 rescue efforts. Alexis, who was shot dead by police, was also arrested repeatedly for alarming offenses. He left the Navy after eight instances of misconduct, Navy officials said. Gun rights activists have fervently maintained gun violence stems from the deranged minds of individuals, and new gun restrictions won't do anything to curb the killings. The National Rifle Association has long been supportive of laws that keep guns out of the hands of those deemed mentally incompetent. Following the Virginia Tech massacre, the NRA backed a 2007 law that encouraged states to submit records of dangerously mentally ill individuals to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. ""The people that have been involved in these shootings have been people who have been severely mentally ill,"" David Keene, then-NRA president, said in January. Data released last year by the FBI shows that of the nearly one million federal denials of gun purchase attempts between 1998 and 2012, about 5,481 stemmed from mental health issues. Only about half of states still report records of those at risk. As of late 2011, 23 states and the District of Columbia had submitted records to NICS, with 17 of those states submitting fewer than 10 records, according to a report compiled by Mayors Against Illegal Guns. States face an array of logistical, technological and privacy obstacles in reporting those records, according to reports from government agencies and the Congressional Research Office. With that said, much work remains to be done for Congress if they decide to tackle mental health in the context of gun violence. A popular policy that's gaining ground . Polls also indicate the public favors increased mental health treatment as a way to prevent gun violence. Asked how much better mental health services would help the problem, 46% said ""a lot,"" while 35% said ""some,"" and 9% said ""not much,"" according to a CBS News poll from February 2013—at the height of this year's gun control debate. Asked in the same survey how much stricter gun laws could help 21% said ""a lot,"" 33% said ""some,"" 19% said ""not much"" and 26% said ""not at all."" When President Barack Obama announced a series of 23 executive actions in his gun control push this year, four of them focused on mental health components. White House spokesman Jay Carney was asked after the Navy Yard shooting whether Obama would push for renewed conversation about mental health and gun control—or, the reporter asked, does the president accept ""this is the normal?"" ""Well, he doesn't accept that it's the new normal. He believes that Americans don't and can't accept that,"" Carney said. ""We continue to call on Congress to listen to the voices of their constituents and legislate accordingly. And that includes mental health matters.""","Gun-control debate drowned out calls for better mental health services .

"(CNN) -- After Apple, Samsung and Google, another company is now rumored to be building a smart watch: South Korea's electronics giant LG.

Of course, details about the devices are lacking, which means we now have not one but four ""upcoming"" smart watches, and absolutely nothing is known about any of them. It's possible these companies consider the smart watch the next big thing. Remember some of these companies, namely LG, have built a phone-watch hybrid (pictured above) before.

"(CNN) -- The most insistent political question of the past four years has been: How can more Americans get access to medical care? The federal response was the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Better known as ""Obamacare,"" it is a complex mix of insurance changes and tax credits. When the act takes effect on January 1, 2014, it will provide access to insurance to about 30 million people who currently don't have it. Unfortunately, that was the wrong question. So the looming ""answer"" is wrong as well. Here's the right question: How can we improve medical care so that it's worth extending it to more people? In other words, how can we create a health care system that helps people become and stay healthy? I have argued for years that we do not have a health care system in America. We have a disease-management system -- one that depends on ruinously expensive drugs and surgeries that treat health conditions after they manifest rather than giving our citizens simple diet, lifestyle and therapeutic tools to keep them healthy. CNN special report: ""Escape Fire"" The brutal fact is that we spend more on health care than any other country -- an estimated $9,348 per capita in 2013 -- and get shockingly little for our money. The U.S. ""currently ranks lowest on a variety of health measures,"" concludes a new report from an expert panel commissioned by the National Institutes of Health. Specifically, Americans have more obesity, more sexually transmitted diseases, shorter life expectancies and higher infant mortality than the inhabitants of nearly all of the 16 developed ""peer"" countries studied. Why? A major culprit is a medical system based on maximizing profits rather than fostering good health. Let me be clear. I am not against all forms of high-tech medicine. Drugs and surgeries have a secure place in the treatment of serious health conditions. But modern American medicine treats almost every health condition as if it were an emergency. This leads to vast wealth for the corporate medical complex but poor health outcomes and empty wallets for the patients. Making this system more accessible by passing costs to taxpayers will simply spread its failures more broadly. The medical philosophy known as integrative medicine offers a better alternative. As defined by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine at the National Institutes of Health, IM combines mainstream medical therapies and complementary and alternative therapies ""for which there is some high-quality scientific evidence of safety and effectiveness."" It uses high-tech medicine sparingly to treat the most serious conditions while employing nutrition, exercise, stress-reduction and other simple, low-cost (or free) interventions to foster long-term health and resilience. It's one thing to read about the horrors of the modern medical system. It's quite another to see them vividly displayed in the faces and bodies of suffering Americans. I was honored to be interviewed for the documentary ""Escape Fire: The Fight to Rescue American Healthcare,"" premiering at 8 and 11 p.m. ET Sunday, March 10, on CNN. The film offers an unflinching look at the causes and effects of our medical system's problems and provides some hopeful solutions. Highlights include: . -- The torturous journey of Sgt. Robert Yates, an injured veteran wounded in Afghanistan. He was prescribed a shopping bag full of prescription medications that left him broken and miserable in body, mind and spirit. Watching Yates begins to regain his health through gentle, low-cost therapies, including meditation and acupuncture, is profoundly moving. -- A look at the revolutionary Safeway Healthy Measures Program. It gives the supermarket chain's employees financial incentives for taking responsibility for their own health, decreasing Safeway's insurance costs significantly while improving participants' well-being. -- The dramatic story of Dr. Erin Martin, an Oregon primary care physician fed up with being pushed to treat patients faster and faster to boost clinic profits. She enrolled in the Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine's Fellowship Program to find a better way, explaining that ""I'm not interested in getting my productivity up -- I'm interested in helping patients."" The film takes its name from the practice of setting a small fire to clear out nearby brush, allowing a fast-advancing forest fire to pass by harmlessly. Will we be sufficiently clear-eyed and rational to take a similarly bold action to avoid disaster wrought by our dysfunctional health care system? I hope so. In the film, I say, ""The present system doesn't work, and it's going to take us down. We need a whole new kind of medicine."" I am grateful to filmmakers Matthew Heineman and Susan Froemke for making that case in this persuasive and eloquent documentary. Please tune in to CNN Sunday evening.

"(CNN) -- Vivienne Westwood is as bald as a baby, the faintest hint of downy white hair sprouting across her naked scalp. Painted pink eyebrows sweep dramatically outwards. Wearing a sparkling, woven brown dress resembling an expensive hessian sack, she totters onto the stage at London's Southbank arts centre. Straining forward in her chair, the 72-year-old ""grandmother of punk fashion"" appears both vulnerable and fierce. Fragile and yet fearless. ""The world was so mismanaged and we hated the older generation because they weren't doing anything about it,"" she says about forging Britain's punk aesthetic with then-boyfriend and Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren in the 1970s. ""I don't hate the older people now -- I'm one of them. But I've been trying to do something to change things all my life."" 'God Save the Queen' Decades after the couple started their radical new clothes shop in an area of London called ""World's End"" -- displaying ripped t-shirts, rubber curtains, and even a live rat in a cage -- Westwood has become one of Britain's most prestigious fashion designers. This is the woman who, after receiving an award from Queen Elizabeth II in 1992, famously twirled around for photographers -- without wearing any underwear under her skirt. The provocative lady is still there, though a little more frail-looking these days, speaking at London's annual Women of the World Festival. ""Buy less, choose well, make it last,"" she tells a crowd of hundreds -- mostly women -- patiently listening to a lecture that meanders into climate change, banks, and social responsibility. Campaign culture . Westwood appears almost reluctant to talk about the ""superficial"" fashion industry she has conquered in a career spanning four decades. ""We face mass extinction,"" she says. ""It's being hidden from us because our rulers still pursue their own vested interest, they've been trained to think that the people do not understand what's good for them."" Her trademark head of fiery red hair has been shaved off, not for style -- but to draw attention to climate change.

"Athens (CNN) -- Minor scuffles broke out Wednesday between demonstrators and police in Athens as thousands of Greeks took to the streets to protest new austerity measures that critics describe as draconian. The daylong general strike is the first called by unions since Greece's new coalition government was formed in June and comes as the country grapples with an economic crisis and heavy debt burden. Police spokesman Panagiotis Papapetropoulos told CNN that some protesters had thrown Molotov cocktails in Syntagma Square, opposite the Greek parliament building in central Athens. Police responded with tear gas. Live footage from the square as the trouble briefly flared showed smoke rising from burning tires, as police in riot gear faced hooded protesters lobbing petrol bombs. At least 20 people were arrested amid the disorder, Papapetropoulos said. By late afternoon, the protest had dispersed. Police put the number of demonstrators in Athens at about 35,000; while protest organizers said more than 50,000 people had turned out. In return for international bailout funds, Greece has agreed to a harsh austerity program and labor market reforms -- measures that have led to violent street demonstrations in the past. Give Greece more time, says French prime minister . The Greek government is seeking new ways to implement budget cuts of 11.5 billion euros ($14.49 billion) to ensure the country receives another international bailout installment in October. The one-day strike in protest against further cuts was organized by the two biggest unions in the country, with rallies in a number of cities across Greece, including Patras, west of Athens. CNN iReporter Costas Liveris, a public worker, was among those taking part in the demonstration in the capital. Liveris, 36, has been hit hard by the country's economic crisis, losing 50% of his salary and barely clinging to his job as the price of basic foodstuffs continues to rise. ""I'm furious because even after the elections, we got promises but nothing [from the government],"" he said. ""It's the same policy but just a different party. ""For the last few hours on the protest, me and my colleagues discussed how disappointed we are. We have no hope."" Liveris said he and his fellow Greeks stand in total support of the Spanish people who protested against austerity Tuesday evening. ""It is the same policies that strangle the same people. We 100% stand with the Spanish,"" he said. Dozens of people were injured and arrested as protesters and police clashed in central Madrid. Demonstrators said police were shooting into the crowd with rubber bullets, although police would not comment. Officers at one point baton-charged the protesters to prevent them from approaching the Spanish parliament, which was in session. As large numbers began to assemble in Athens and other cities earlier Wednesday, Constantine Michalos, president of the Athens Chamber of Commerce, said he hoped the strike would not turn violent. Many people are tired of years of government-imposed belt-tightening measures that have not worked, Michalos said. ""The Greek people have taken up tremendous sacrifices in this time period, and it just has not delivered the desired results,"" Michalos said. ""Where we need to concentrate today is not on further austerity measures, because there have been extreme sacrifices made by Greek people in the last three years. What we need is to advance growth and stimulate the economy."" Barroso: Europe federation 'unavoidable' Parts of central Athens were closed to traffic Wednesday as protesters took to the streets, but they reopened later. The strike has shut down much of the public transport network, with no metro or electric railway services in operation. Buses and trolleys are operating only from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. local time. Many ships are confined to docks, and air traffic controllers held a two-hour strike, causing some disruption to flights. Schools are closed, and hospitals are operating on skeleton staff. Greece is in the grip of a years-long recession, and many people are struggling to make ends meet. While salaries have been cut for many workers, pensions and benefits have been slashed and unemployment rates have soared. As of May 2012, 53.8% of Greeks younger than 25 were unemployed, according to Eurostat, the statistics division of the European Commission. Greece's long-running economic woes have shaken global markets and led to fears the country could crash out of the eurozone single currency if it defaults on its debt. Last month, Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin to plead for more time to push through reforms to public finances. Members of the 17-nation currency bloc are waiting for the troika's report on Greece's troubled economy, due in the coming weeks, before making a decision. The turmoil in the eurozone has exacerbated concerns about other ailing nations such as Spain and Italy, which are also struggling with high unemployment and debt.

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Three prominent tribal leaders, including the head of Saddam Hussein's Sunni tribe and two others who had been working for national reconciliation, were killed over the past 24 hours in northern Iraq. Sunnis visit Saddam Hussein's grave in 2007. The man who took Hussein's body for burial was killed Tuesday. A bomb on Tuesday killed Sheikh Ali al-Nida, head of the al-Bou Nasir tribe, which includes Hussein's family, according to an official from Salaheddin province. The sheikh was traveling from Ouja, Hussein's hometown, toward Tikrit when an explosive attached to his sport utility vehicle detonated. He and his driver were killed, and two bodyguards were critically wounded. Al-Nida was leader in Ouja of the Awakening Council, an American-backed group of former insurgents or their supporters. In December 2006, al-Nida flew to Baghdad and picked up Hussein's body for burial in Ouja after the former dictator's execution. In Mosul, gunmen shot dead two tribal leaders from Tal Afar, an Iraqi Interior Ministry official said. Killed were Sheikh Abdul Nour Mohammed al-Tahhan of the Obeid tribe and Sheikh Mohammed Khalil Hamash of the Halabid tribe. They were headed to Tal Afar after attending a meeting in Mosul. Both are Sunni Arabs. They were working to bring together Shiites and Sunnis Turkmen in Tal Afar, which has a large Turkmen population. A Tal Afar official said both sheikhs played big roles in reconciliation there. Mosul and Tal Afar are large cities in Nineveh province, where American and Iraqi troops have been fighting al Qaeda in Iraq. Elsewhere in northern Iraq on Tuesday, Iraqi and U.S.-led coalition troops killed three suspected militants in an operation targeting al Qaeda in Iraq, the U.S. military said. The deaths occurred about 30 miles (48 kilometers) southwest of Kirkuk during an operation targeting an insurgent ""with a long history"" of terrorist activities around Kirkuk, the military said. ""Three armed men refused to comply with instructions to surrender. Responding to the perceived hostile threat, Iraqi and coalition forces engaged the armed men with small-arms fire and supporting aircraft, killing all three terrorists,"" the military said. Five people were detained in the operation, and troops destroyed explosives and grenades found at the scene. Coalition troops have been battling Sunni Arab insurgents in much of northern Iraq, including Tameem province -- which includes oil-rich Kirkuk, where Kurds, Sunni Arabs and Turkmens have been jockeying for political power. Meanwhile, a top American diplomat, explaining talks with Iraq on a bilateral relationship, said Tuesday the United States believes Iraq should not be used as a ""platform"" for strikes on other states.  Watch as Iraq's prime minister reassures Iran about pact with U.S. » . David Satterfield, a senior adviser on Iraq at the State Department, said respect for Iraqi sovereignty is an underpinning of the talks, which he believes can be completed by the end of July.

"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (CNN) -- A video of a teenage Malaysian mother beating her baby daughter has generated a storm of outrage online a year after it was filmed, prompting the Malaysian Police to announce that the woman is already serving an 18-month prison sentence for the offense. In a post on their Facebook page this week, the Malaysian Police said they had received hundreds of complaints and comments about the case after the four-minute video of the mother repeatedly striking the baby with her hand, her foot and a pillow went viral. The video fueled anger and disgust among Internet users from Malaysia to Massachusetts, where local news broadcaster WWLP-22News reported receiving ""many emails"" about the footage. The mother was 18 years old when she inflicted the beating on her 10-month-old child in May 2011, according to Arjunaidi Mohamed, the chief of police in Petaling Jaya, the suburb of Kuala Lumpur where the attack took place. A friend of the mother, who had become concerned after witnessing her beating the child previously, filmed the violence and took the video evidence to the police the same day, Arjunaidi said. As a result, the mother was convicted of child abuse and sentenced to 18 months in prison, he said, declining to disclose her name. Attempts to obtain comment from the mother or a representative for her were unsuccessful Friday. The baby was put into the care of a foster family after her mother's arrest and is now doing ""very well,"" said Fatimah Zuraidah Salleh, deputy director of the children division of the Social Welfare Department. Welfare officials check in every month with the foster family, who are unconnected to the family of the mother, Fatimah said. The initial furor this week among Internet users over the video appeared to stem from uncertainty about when the beating took place and the current status of the mother and child. Once the Malaysian Police clarified the situation, online reactions consisted of relief that the authorities had intervened and dismay that the mother had not received a harsher sentence. ""Good to hear police immediately took action and thanks for clearing the air,"" a Facebook user named Prakash Raj said in a comment on the police's page, adding that he thought the sentence was too light. ""She's lucky that didn't happen here in the States,"" said another Facebook user, Cindy Watanabe. ""Not only would her sentence be a whole lot longer, she probably wouldn't have made it to prison to serve her time and would never be able to hurt another child again."" A court will assess whether the mother, who is to be released in late November, will be allowed to regain custody of the child, should she wish to, Fatimah said, adding that the process is rigorous. Arjunaidi, the police chief, refuted speculation that the mother had been raped before committing the abuse. He said the woman was unmarried. He ascribed the cause of her actions to ""frustration."" It was unclear why the video had surfaced online a year after the event. The police are investigating the leak of the video, Arjunaidi said. By Friday evening, some of the Facebook posts of the video were taken down. CNN's Alden Mahler Levine contributed to this report.","An online furor erupted over a video showing a teenage mother beating her child .

"(CNN)  -- For Alesandra Rain, it all started with sleeplessness. In 1993 she was having marital troubles and her business wasn't doing well. Anxiety kept her up at night, so her general practitioner prescribed sleeping pills. ""It worked fabulously. I felt very relaxed and I would sleep better,"" Rain remembers. ""I thought this was certainly the right prescription for me."" Then a few weeks later, another symptom developed. ""It was so unusual. I started having bronchitis and lung infections,"" she recalls. She went to a pulmonologist who prescribed an antibiotic. Another complication soon followed. ""My heart started skipping beats, so I was referred to a cardiologist,"" explains Rain, who says other than a series of surgeries after a car accident, she had been completely healthy until this point in her life. The cardiologist ran a few tests and prescribed medication to treat arrhythmias. It didn't end there. Eventually she developed seizures. At this point, she was already taking at least six different prescriptions from three separate specialists. She went to see a neurologist who prescribed an anti-seizure medication on top of that. ""My whole day became pills and doctors and shots,"" she says. Rain's insomnia returned as things continued to spiral out of control. Despite all the testing and prescriptions, she says no one could figure out the problem. She was put on temporary disability. Depression followed. ""When I finally got to a shrink of course I was depressed, because no one could figure out what was wrong with me! It never occurred to me that it might be the pills themselves."" Too many drugs, too little communication . At her worst, Rain was under the care of a general practitioner, pulmonologist, cardiologist, pain management specialist and a psychiatrist. She was spending more than $900 a month, taking 12 different types of medication, amounting to about a thousand pills a month. ""That's what I call prescription multiplication,"" says Michael Wincor, an associate professor of clinical pharmacy, psychiatry and the behavioral sciences at the University of Southern California. He says it is not uncommon for patients to receive multiple prescriptions from different specialists, each focusing on a specific symptom. Wincor says it can be potentially dangerous for the patient, especially if the various physicians aren't communicating with one another. ""A patient could have adverse effects and think the medical condition is getting worse, when in fact it is a side effect of several different medications which are all interacting in a negative way,"" Wincor says. ""When you're on more than 20 drugs all at the same time, you'd want to question whether or not that's really necessary."" According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, prescription drug usage in the United States is continuing to rise. A recent report finds the number of prescriptions filled each year increased by 39% between 1999 and 2009, and the amount of money spent was $234 billion in 2008. The average American fills 12 prescriptions each year. ""Many side effects from drug interactions (not all) are exacerbations of known side effects of the single drugs that are made worse by the two drugs together,"" says Dr. Russ Altman, a professor of bioengineering, genetics and medicine at Stanford University. He co-authored a study in the journal Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics that found a widely prescribed antidepressant used in conjunction with a common cholesterol-lowering medication caused unexpected increases in blood sugar levels. Altman says most drugs are tested and approved independently, and it can be difficult to predict the side effects of drug combinations. ""It is very hard to find these in advance of release of the drug, because sometimes these effects will only manifest in the context of large numbers of patients,"" he explains. ""I don't think people really understand the nature of medication; the (drugs) will, by definition, have some toxic, collateral side effects,"" says Dr. Douglas Bremner, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Emory University. His 2008 book ""Before You Take that Pill"" warned patients of the risks and benefits of some commonly prescribed drugs. Bremner says medications clearly do a lot of good and are needed in many situations, but warns that when a patient is on too many ay once, there are serious questions about whether the therapeutic benefits outweigh the collateral. ""When you end up on 12 prescription medications you need to seriously look at what the situation is,"" he says. ""At that point, there's no way of knowing what's causing what anymore."" ""I don't want to do this anymore"" Wincor recommends patients fulfill all their prescriptions at one pharmacy, especially if they are receiving treatment from multiple practitioners. ""Often the pharmacist is the best point person because they're the last stop before the prescription hits the hand of the patient and are ready to be taken."" He says the most important thing is to have one person who is keeping track of the various drugs and how they could interact. If you can't have a single overall manager of treatment, experts suggest keeping a list of all your prescriptions and showing the list to any physician introducing a new medication. Altman says, when possible, introducing new medications one at a time can help you recognize side effects and interactions earlier. You can potentially trace them to the most recent drug added, he says. Bremner also advises patients to check out websites like Medications.com and Askapatient.com and read the experiences others have had with the medication you have just been prescribed. ""Patients should become more educated about the effects and not just blindly take what is given to them."" Alesandra Rain says she reached her tipping point in 2003. ""I opened my medicine cabinet and saw it lined with prescription pill bottles,"" she remembers. ""I looked at myself in the mirror. My skin was gray, I was hunched over in pain, my eyes were swollen and I had no quality of life. I thought, 'I don't want to do this anymore.' "" She decided to quit taking all her prescriptions cold turkey -- something neither she nor other experts recommend for any patient. ""You can't go cold turkey off that many pills without doing some damage,"" Rain says. She eventually enrolled in a drug rehab facility that helps victims of substance abuse. Today, Rain runs a company called Point of Return, which educates patients about the effects of prescription medications and helps them outline an ""exit strategy"" for safely tapering off highly addictive varieties of prescription drugs. ""I spent 10 years on the pills before I realized there was no exit strategy. It was always more drugs, never less."" says Rain, who later learned the cause of her initial insomnia was a B-12 vitamin deficiency. She is now taking one daily multivitamin. ""My life became nothing but a bag of pills, and I just thought there has to be a different way.""","At one point, Alesandra Rain was seeing six specialists .

"(CNN) -- Everyone knows that it's a time of dramatic change in Asia's airline industry. What many often fail to appreciate, however, is how much of that drama is being driven by an exponential rise of low-cost carriers (LCC) in the region. Consider a small sampling of the recent upheaval in Asia's skies. Following the dissolution of an ANA-AirAsia joint venture, AirAsia Japan is being rebranded (hilariously, to some) as Vanilla Air; Singapore's Tiger Airways has the new name of Tigerair; and Jetstar Hong Kong is expected to launch within the year; . Meanwhile, South Korea's Jeju Air has been busy recording a whopping 960% increase in profits compared with last year. Beating out all foreign legacy and low-cost carriers, its become the third largest carrier at Seoul's Incheon Airport after Korean Air and Asiana Airlines. While Southeast Asia has a remarkably high LCC presence of almost 50% -- meaning more than half of total seats are sold by low-cost carriers -- North Asia still has an extremely low LCC penetration and thus represents the biggest opportunity for the industry. North Asian travelers who have grown partial to the over-the-top service and quality of legacy carriers in the region are still finding the concept of low-cost carriers foreign, or simply irrelevant. ""They don't pop up in my searches when I look on travel sites, and it just doesn't occur to me to fly them because I have my existing frequent flyer programs that I feel bound to,"" says frequent business traveler Sunmi Park, 38, of South Korea. For the unacquainted, such as Park, here's a quick guide to the fleets with the often quirky names and bright liveries. 1. LCC fleets are young and frequently built around a single model . ""People tend to think that low-cost carriers have these old planes, but that is a complete myth,"" said Edward Lau, CEO of Jetstar Hong Kong, in a low-cost carrier workshop earlier this month. ""The opposite is actually true."" In order to keep the cost of buying planes as low as possible, low-cost carriers place bulk orders of the newest planes. For the same reason, each LCC usually has just one type of plane in its fleet -- bulk orders of the same plane get better pricing. When Jetstar's new Hong Kong airline debuts later this year (pending government approval) it will be launching with 18 new Airbus 320-200 aircraft. Apart from its new Hong Kong fleet, Jetstar's planes across all affiliates have an average age of four to five years. Similarly, AirAsia, the Kuala Lumpur based low-cost carrier that flies to more than 80 destinations in Asia, has a fleet of 141 Airbus A320 aircraft, with an average age of three years per plane. 2. Competitiveness hinges on ""fast turns"" and ""double daily"" service . In aviation lingo, a ""turn"" means the time it takes for a plane to take off on its next flight after landing. For LCCs, fast turns of about 25-40 minutes are imperative to keep costs down and to maintain high levels of aircraft utilization -- the time a plane is in the air each day. Full service carriers take about an hour and a half on turns. Even in an aviation market known for delays -- China is notorious -- LCCs keep costs down by factoring delays into their schedules. To keep LCCs viable for consumers, airlines need to have at least some ""double daily"" flights -- flights to the same destination at least twice a day. This means that if passengers miss their flight, they can take a flight to the same destination later the same day. ""The target of 'double daily' is to build scale and support integrity,"" says Alistair Hartley, Jetstar's executive director of planning and airline partnerships. 3. LCCs' entry into a market can stimulate the overall market . Studies have shown that LCC penetration can result in overall travel market growth in a given region. The launch of a low-cost carrier may eat into a dominant full-service carrier's market share, but the number of passengers in a market has been shown to increase overall, not only for the low-cost carrier, but for full-service carriers. The latter tend to lower prices in response to what LCCs are offering, scrambling to adapt business models to a new landscape. 4. LCCs have meant the most to Japan . Japan is the most interesting example of a stagnant market stimulated by the launch of low-cost carriers. Despite being one of the largest domestic aviation markets in the world, Japan has showed little or no growth in passenger numbers since the turn of the century. ""Japan has the unenviable distinction of being the only major market in the world to have about the same traffic today as 15 years ago,"" said a Centre for Aviation (CAPA) report published in August. However, with the launch of three low-cost carriers in 2012 -- Peach, Jetstar Japan and AirAsia Japan -- the ""abysmal"" domestic aviation market grew for the first time in six years. With the introduction of low fares, Japanese who couldn't afford to fly began traveling, with remarkable results. Domestic passenger numbers increased by 8.7% in 2012, the largest percentage growth in 20 years. Collectively, the three low-cost carriers added 2.6 million passengers to the domestic market and Jetstar Japan is now the largest domestic carrier from Tokyo Narita Airport. ""The contribution is not just in greater volumes of passengers whose traveling has a trickle-down effect across the economy, it is also in giving Japan's legacy carriers an incentive to become more efficient,"" said the CAPA report. 5. North Asia represents the greatest opportunity . The figures speak for themselves. Air traffic in Asia will increase dramatically in the next few decades. While U.S. airport passenger traffic was 1.467 billion arrivals (the largest in the world) and Asia's was 1.402 billion in 2009, Asia is expected to become the largest aviation market in the next few years. Hello Kitty: World's cutest planes head to the U.S. By 2030, Asia's passenger traffic is expected to exceed 4.88 billion, in contrast to 2.367 billion projected for the U.S., according to IATA's Airport Development Supplement published in 2012. Southeast Asia already has a high LCC penetration rate -- the LCC capacity share of total seats is approximately 56-57% -- but the percentage for North Asia is stunningly low at 9%. ""That's a 91% potential upside for us,"" says Jetstar's Alistair Hartley. No wonder LCCs are excited. And growing.","Low-cost carriers (LCC) are a major part of Asia's booming airline industry .

"(CNN) -- Racist abuse on social media shows no sign of diminishing in European football after British police launched an investigation into abusive tweets sent to Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli. The Italian international tweeted ""Man Utd...LOL"" on Sunday after Liverpool's rivals Mancheser United slumped to a surprise 5-3 defeat by Leicester City in the English Premier League, seemingly provoking a discriminatory response. ""We can confirm officers are looking into offensive comments made on Twitter about Mario Balotelli,"" said Merseyside Police on their official Twitter feed. The 24-year-old Balotelli's tweet was retweeted 150,000 times and was met with a torrent of abuse. ""We extend our support to Mario Balotelli after the appalling racist abuse directed at him on Twitter,"" said British anti-racism group Kick It Out. ""A large number of social media users alerted us to the messages by tweeting our official account and we have since reported this via True Vision -- the police's online reporting facility. ""During the 2013/14 season, 50% of all complaints submitted to us from across the game related to social media abuse,"" added the Kick It Out statement. ""The issue has been escalating and we urge fellow social media users to assist in bringing this type of abuse to the attention of the authorities by reporting directly to True Vision."" In an interview with CNN in 2013, Mario Balotelli -- then an AC Milan player-- vowed to walk off the pitch if he was racially abused at a football game. That was after he was subjected to racist chanting during an Italian league game against Roma at AC Milan's San Siro stadium. The 22-year-old put his fingers to his lips in front of the visiting supporters' section as a section of fans directed ""monkey chants"" at him and then teammate Kevin Prince-Boateng. In August, Balotelli joined LIverpool from Milan in a $26.5 million deal. The Italian has scored one goal since signing -- in Liverpool's 2-1 Champions League win against Ludogorets -- but the Merseyside club has had an uncertain start to the domestic season, losing three of their opening five games. The Italian is well known to English football fans after a turbulent two-and-a-half-year stint with Manchester City, where he helped the team to a first league title in 44 years while also gaining a cult following for his off-field antics.","British police investigate abusive tweets sent to Mario Balotelli .

"(CNN) -- One of Germany's most famous footballers has been banned by soccer's ruling body for failing to cooperate with an investigation into corruption within the game. Franz Beckenbauer, the only man to win the World Cup as captain and coach, has been provisionally suspended from any football-related activity for 90 days. FIFA said in a statement Friday that the 68-year-old had been asked to help with its Ethics Committee's probe into allegations against Qatar 2022 and the World Cup bidding process. ""The apparent breach relates to Mr. Beckenbauer's failure to cooperate despite repeated requests for his assistance, including requests that he provide information during an in-person interview or in response to written questions provided in both English and German,"" FIFA said. ""The case is now the subject of formal investigation proceedings being conducted by investigatory chamber member Vanessa Allard as chief of the investigation."" The chairman of the committee's investigatory body, New York lawyer Michael Garcia, is expected to announce his findings by the end of July after a long-running examination of the circumstances that saw Russia and Qatar awarded the 2018 and 2022 World Cups respectively. The December 2010 vote by FIFA's executive committee members to take the sport's showpiece tournament to the Middle East for the first time has been mired in controversy. Before it even took place, two high-ranking FIFA officials -- Nigeria's Amos Adamu and Oceania representative Reynald Temarii -- were banned after allegations of bribery. FIFA vice-president Jack Warner chose to quit the following year after being implicated in another bribery scandal involving Mohamed bin Hammam, then head of the Asian Football Confederation. Bin Hammam, who had hoped to be Sepp Blatter's sole challenger at that year's FIFA presidential elections, was banned for life. The Qatari has this year been involved in new allegations by Britain's Sunday Times newspaper, which claimed he had been offering bribes to FIFA delegates for support of his country's 2022 bid. The 65-year-old -- a former FIFA ExCO member -- has denied all accusations, while the Qatar 2022 Organizing Committee insisted that Bin Hammam had not been working for them. Garcia told FIFA's Congress of its 209 member nations this month that he had been aware of most of the evidence published by the Sunday Times ahead of the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, which kicked off on Thursday. Blatter used the Congress in Sao Paulo to indicate that he wants to stand for a fifth term in charge, breaking the promise he made when winning unopposed in 2011 that it would be his last. The 78-year-old, who has been in office since 1998, said his mission ""is not finished."" It sparked anger among FIFA's European member nations, with UEFA president Michel Platini withdrawing his support for Blatter. The former France international has indicated he is unlikely to run against the Swiss in next year's elections, but compatriot and former FIFA official Jerome Champagne will stand against his old boss Blatter. Beckenbauer led West Germany to World Cup success as a player in 1974 and as coach in 1990. He played a leading role in a united Germany hosting the 2006 tournament, and was one of the 22 FIFA EXCo members who voted on the 2018 and 2022 events. The Sunday Times alleged that he visited Qatar before and after the 2010 vote after being invited by Bin Hammam. Last week Beckenbauer told German media that he did not respond to Garcia's questions because they were in English and he did not understand them. Although he is no longer an ExCo member, Beckenbauer is still listed on the ruling body's website as a special adviser to the FIFA Football Committee. He is also an honorary president at Bayern Munich, the club where he spent most of his playing career and won three successive European Cups from 1974-76 and four German Bundesliga titles. Meanwhile, Interpol has sent a team to Brazil and to key areas around the world due to serious concerns about match-fixing and illegal betting at the World Cup. ""There are organized crime groups engaged in illegal betting, and with illegal betting there's a greater likelihood that there could be an influence on the outcome of the match or an influence on what happens on the pitch based on a bribe or some kind of corrupt act,"" the international crime agency's Secretary General Ron Noble told CNN Friday.","FIFA bans German great Franz Beckenbauer from football-related activities for 90 days .

But if you compare every county in the United States, Manhattan has only the third-highest estimated level of income inequality. A little place in Louisiana takes the title. East Carroll Parish, Louisiana, is home to 7,500 people, some of whom make six and seven figures and 41% of whom live below the federal poverty line. And is one U.S. capital of income inequality. The farming community, with picturesque Lake Providence at its center, is a scary window into the future -- a look at where the rest of the country is headed if we don't change our economic policies to work for everyone, not primarily the rich. The parish, tucked into the northeastern corner of the state, is the subject of my latest Change the List project because CNN readers voted earlier this summer for me to cover income inequality in the place where it is most extreme. You chose it as the top social justice issue of our time from a list of 20. Below, you'll find a list of the 25 most equal and most unequal counties (including parishes and equivalents) in the United States. These numbers come from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey, which uses a wonky measurement called the Gini Index to measure income inequality. A rating of 0 means the place has perfect economic equality. A rating of 100 means only one person in that place makes literally all of the money and everyone else is left with $0. The most equal countries in the world get ratings in the 20s and 30s. The United States, which is the most economically divided of all of the developed countries, had a Gini index of almost 48 in 2012, putting it behind the most-equal nations such as Sweden, Norway and Denmark, of course. But America, land of the free, home of the middle class, is worse on this measure than Iran, Nigeria and Nicaragua, according to a CIA list. Some argue income inequality fosters competition and growth. There's evidence, however, it's doing just the opposite. ""Inequality stifles, restrains and holds back our growth,"" the Nobel-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz wrote in January. ""When even the free-market-oriented magazine The Economist argues -- as it did in a special feature in October -- that the magnitude and nature of the country's inequality represent a serious threat to America, we should know that something has gone horribly wrong."" Meanwhile, extreme economic gaps tear at the fabric of society. We're a better country when prosperity is shared, as it was before the late 1970s. The data below is averaged over the five-year period from 2007 to 2011, which is the latest data available that includes all counties, including the smaller places. Some counties technically overlap because of margin of error, and the Gini index numbers are estimates. You can find a similar but older ranking in a 2012 Census report.

"(CNN) -- Luis Suarez, a player of unquestionable talent but with an unfortunate tendency to bite, now faces disciplinary action from soccer's governing body after he appeared to sink his teeth into an opponent yet again. FIFA said Wednesday that it has begun proceedings after the Uruguay striker was accused of biting another player during his team's World Cup victory over Italy a day earlier. Television pictures showed Suarez dipping his head toward Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini, sending both men tumbling to the ground. When the Italian defender eventually got up, he pulled down his shirt and furiously indicated he had been bitten on the shoulder. Suarez, 27, has already been banned twice in his career for his wayward teeth. But those offenses happened in club-level games. Tuesday's incident was during soccer's biggest spectacle, in front of an audience of millions. And whether he's ultimately found guilty, Suarez's teeth baring now takes its place in the annals of World Cup controversy, along with Diego Maradona's ""hand of God"" goal and Zinedine Zidane's headbutt. Suarez and the Uruguayan Football Association have until 5 p.m. Brasilia time (4 p.m. ET) Wednesday ""to provide their position and any documentary evidence they deem relevant"" to the disciplinary proceedings, FIFA said. Suarez, a mercurial player who has earned both accolades and ignominy in his career, could face a maximum ban of 24 matches or two years. It will probably be much less. Former Italian international Mauro Tassotti was given an eight-match ban in 1994, the longest suspension in World Cup history, after breaking the nose of Spain's Luis Enrique. And Zidane, the former France midfielder, was handed a three-match ban for headbutting Marco Materazzi in the 2006 final. After the game, which Uruguay won 1-0, Suarez said he simply collided with Chiellini's shoulder. ""The only thing I know,"" he said, ""is that those are occurrences that happen on the pitch."" 'Suarez is a sneak' To a large extent, Uruguay's fate at the World Cup rests on Suarez. Forced to undergo surgery, he missed Uruguay's opening game against Costa Rica. His team lost. He made a dramatic return in time to face England just five weeks after his operation -- and scored both goals in the South American side's 2-1 win. Then came Tuesday's faceoff with Italy. The two teams were scoreless in the first half. Then came the controversial tussle. Moments later, Uruguay's Diego Godin scored the match's only goal. Despite vigorous objection from the Italian players, the Mexican referee refused to look at Chiellini's shoulder, or penalize Suarez. (In yet another bizarre coincidence, the Mexican referee Marco Antonio Rodriguez is known as ""Dracula"" for his apparent resemblance to the actor who plays the character in a TV show there). ""Suarez is a sneak and he gets away with it because FIFA want their stars to play in the World Cup,"" Chiellini told Sky Sports Italia afterward. ""I'd love to see if they have the courage to use video evidence against him. The referee saw the bite mark too, but he did nothing about it."" Facing criticism again . FIFA vice-president Jim Boyce, who also presides as head of the organization's referees committee, said he had serious concerns over Suarez's actions. ""I have watched the incident several times on television,"" he said. ""There is no doubt Luis Suarez is a fantastic footballer but, once again, his actions have left him open to severe criticism."" Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez said he didn't spot the incident but would like to see images of it. ""And if it happened, the referee probably didn't see it,"" he said. ""So no, I don't have any more comments to make. We had more important things than this in a football match."" But he suggested that Suarez was being singled out by the media. ""There seems there is animosity against this football player,"" Tabarez said. ""He just came out of a difficult moment and he has been penalized. There are people hiding behind the tree waiting for something to happen."" Defended by captain . The Uruguay team captain, Diego Lugano, blamed Chiellini for exaggerating the episode. When asked by reporters about the incident, he said, ""You saw this, really? ""You need to show me because I didn't see anything. ""Did you see it today or did you see what happened in other years. You couldn't have seen it today because nothing happened. ""The worst of everything is the attitude of Chiellini. He's a great player, with an enormous status. It doesn't correspond with Italian football. As sportsmen leaving the field, crying and appealing against a rival. As a man he disappointed me totally."" Previous bites . The Uruguayan, who plays his club football with Liverpool, was banned for 10 games in April 2013 after being found guilty of biting Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic. He was also guilty of biting during his time in the Netherlands with Ajax where he was banned for seven games after leaving a scar on the collarbone of Otman Bakkal. Suarez's rap sheet is lengthy. At the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, he deliberately handled the ball on the goal-line to deny Ghana a place in the semifinals of the World Cup. He was sent off for his troubles but Ghana missed the penalty and Uruguay went on to finish third in the tournament. The following year after his move to Liverpool, Suarez was found guilty of racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra. He was fined $63,000 and banned for eight matches. Dazzling season . Last week, after scoring both goals in the game against England, Suarez hit out at the British media after claiming he had been unfairly treated over his transgressions. ""Before the game people in England laughed about my attitude over the last few years,"" he said. ""I want to see what they think now. I have dreamed of this moment."" Suarez enjoyed a sensational season with Liverpool -- scoring 31 league goals to help his club qualify for the Champions League. He was voted Player of the Year by his fellow colleagues and also named as the journalists' Player of the Year too -- awards that reflected a feeling that Suarez had put his troubled past behind him. But all those controversies came rushing back to haunt him Tuesday. His tangle with Chiellini appears to have put his participation in the rest of the World Cup in serious doubt. In this case, he may have bitten off more than he can chew. How social media chewed up Luis Suarez . Reality bites, but Uruguay have their hero's back . Smitten or bitten? Some adore Uruguay's Luis Suarez, others cry foul .

"(CNN) -- The military leader who took control of Thailand in a coup in May has been named the country's prime minister. Thailand's National Legislative Assembly selected General Prayuth Chan-ocha to lead the government in a vote on Thursday. He was the sole candidate for the post. Members of the assembly were chosen by Prayuth; more than half are also in the military. Prayuth seized control of the country on May 22, 2014 after months of unrest destabilized the elected government, led by former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra. Yingluck's promotion as leader in 2011 led to violent protests and counter-protests amid calls for her to resign. Critics accused Yingluck of acting as a mouthpiece for her brother, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was deposed in the last coup in 2006 and is now living in exile. After taking power, military authorities summoned leading political officials and other prominent figures. It imposed travel bans and delivered the firm message that dissent would not be tolerated. King's approval . A curfew was imposed, the military threw out the constitution, and Prayuth announced he'd be assuming powers to act as prime minister until a new one took office. Prayuth's formal promotion to the role needs to be approved by Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej, though that's considered a formality. The military leader announced in May that he had the revered King's backing to assume leadership. Since taking power, the Thai military has enforced the rule of law, seizing guns, arresting suspected criminals and shutting down illegal businesses.","Thai national assembly chooses coup leader as new prime minister .
