"(CNN) -- Experts said Thursday that the alleged child sexual abuse scandals at Penn State University and another at The Citadel in South Carolina underscore the frailty and inconsistency of the legal system intended to protect children, while some lawmakers called for changes in reporting such crimes. ""As parents, as members of the community, as leaders of organizations, we need to ask ourselves what we can do to prevent the next Penn State,"" said Stop It Now!, a group that seeks to end child sexual abuse, in a commentary on its website. ""Because, unfortunately, it will happen again, unless something fundamental changes."" In the Citadel case, a former cadet-turned-camp counselor faces a series of charges, including three counts of criminal sexual conduct with a minor and three counts of lewd act on a minor, according to Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, police. The school's president said this week that the university is ""profoundly sorry"" for not reporting allegations against the counselor in 2007. In the Penn State case, Pennsylvania's attorney general has charged a former Penn State football coach, Jerry Sandusky, with 40 counts in what authorities allege was the sexual abuse of eight boys. In addition, two Penn State officials are charged with failing to inform police of the allegations, and questions have been raised about the university's response. Child-welfare advocates are not alone in their calls for reform. The senior Democrat on the House Education and the Workforce Committee asked Thursday that the chairman call a hearing to determine whether federal laws intended to protect children and students should be changed. ""Potential weaknesses in specific laws designed to keep children safe have come to light in the wake of the alleged sexual crimes committed on the campuses of the Pennsylvania State University and the Citadel,"" wrote Rep. George Miller, D-California in his letter to Chairman John Kline, R-Minnesota. ""Our inquiry should not seek to parallel, replicate, or interfere with those efforts; rather, we must examine the ongoing operation of the underlying federal laws to identify any vulnerabilities and better ensure against future risks to children."" Miller cited two federal laws: The Clery Act requires higher educational institutions to collect information about and report on crimes that occur on campus. The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act requires states to develop laws mandating that child abuse be reported. In a statement, Education and the Workforce Committee communications director Alexandra Sollberger said, ""The committee is monitoring the situation at Penn State carefully and will assess the need for congressional action after the Department of Education concludes its investigation into the matter."" One state has already moved to tighten reporting requirements. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal on Thursday issued an executive order requiring ""all public or vocational school, community college, college or university professors, administrators, coaches and other school employees to report child abuse or neglect within 24 hours of observing an incident of child abuse or neglect."" The report must be made to child welfare authorities and police. Changes should include tightening requirements among the states about who must report suspicions that a child is being sexually abused, said Lisa Fontes, a lecturer at University Without Walls at the University of Massachusetts - Amherst and author of ""Child Abuse and Culture -- Working with Diverse Families."" For example, Pennsylvania has an unusually narrow category of mandated reporters. The Department of Health and Human Services' website says that, in Pennsylvania, professionals ""required to report include, but are not limited to: licensed physicians, osteopaths, medical examiners, coroners, funeral directors, dentists, optometrists, chiropractors, podiatrists, interns, nurses, or hospital personnel, Christian Science practitioners or members of the clergy; school administrators, teachers, school nurses, social services workers, daycare center workers, or any other child care or foster care workers; mental health professionals; peace officers or law enforcement officials."" ""It doesn't include many people who have regular contact with children, such as school bus drivers, children's barbers, athletic coaches,"" said Fontes, who has a doctorate in psychology. Under ""Reporting by other persons,"" the law appears to leave it up to the individual: ""Any person who has reason to suspect that a child is abused or neglected may report,"" it says. And the requirements of professionals are limited to what they learn on the job, and do not apply to cases where a professional learns about suspected child abuse outside of his or her work, Fontes told CNN in a telephone interview. Some states, like Indiana, are stricter. Professionals required to report include ""any staff member of a medical or other public or private institution, school, facility, or agency."" And the onus in Indiana also falls on non-professionals. ""Any person who has reason to believe that a child is a victim of abuse or neglect must report,"" the law says. Such variation ""makes no sense to me,"" said Fontes. ""Mandatory reporting is not the be all, end all of preventing child abuse, but it certainly is an important part of making authorities aware of children at risk,"" she said. Variation also extends to laws covering other behaviors, such as age of consent, which ranges from 16 to 18 in the United States, with some states having age-gap provisions under which sexual relations are legal as long as both parties are within a certain age range. Children from poor families tend to be particularly vulnerable to child predators, said Fontes, who noted that the alleged victims were from The Second Mile, a program founded by Sandusky for at-risk youths. Poor families tend to have fewer options for after-school care; poor communities tend to lack public libraries and safe parks; and their schools are less likely to be staffed with adequate guidance counselors and school psychologists who might notice if a child's behavior has changed, Fontes said. In addition, children from poor families may be more vulnerable to offers of gifts, as Sandusky is alleged to have made, she said. In the Penn State case, the grand jury report led to the firing last week of head football coach Joe Paterno and President Graham Spanier. Assistant coach Mike McQueary -- who, according to the grand jury report, witnessed Sandusky raping a child in 2002 -- has been placed on administrative leave. Gary Schultz, who was the university's senior vice president for finance and business at the time of the alleged assault, and former Penn State Athletic Director Tim Curley are charged with lying to the grand jury and failing to alert police. Curley requested and was granted administrative leave, while Schultz -- whose responsibilities also included oversight of Penn State campus police -- has retired. Sandusky told NBC's Bob Costas on Monday that he has been falsely accused, saying that he only ""horsed around"" with kids in the shower after workouts. Sandusky denied being sexually attracted to boys, and his lawyer, Joe Amendola, told CNN Monday night that showering with children does not equate automatically to sexual assault. In the NBC interview, Sandusky denied one of the charges in the grand jury report, i.e., that McQueary had walked in on him in the school's locker room raping a boy about 10 years of age. Sandusky was arrested on November 5 after the release of the grand jury report detailing crimes that he allegedly committed between 1994 and 2009. He is free on $100,000 bail. Authorities have said they are checking into more than a dozen calls from people who have said they were victimized by Sandusky. Several other alleged victims are considering coming forward after seeing Sandusky's Monday interview, two State College attorneys told the Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Patriot-News. ""I spent about half the day in kitchens and living rooms, speaking with victims of Sandusky's molestation and processing with them the effects of Jerry Sandusky being on television and Jerry Sandusky denying wrongdoing,"" attorney Andy Shubin told the newspaper. ""And what I found was that these folks are being re-traumatized."" He said many of the alleged victims weren't sure whether they would contact police, as some cases may be too old to prosecute. One case dates back to the 1970s, the newspaper reported. Lawyer Jeff Anderson told CNN he is representing one alleged victim and has received calls from more than 10 other people who said they, too, were victimized. ""In every instance, Sandusky used his position of trust and power and his caring ways as a coach and mentor to groom the families and the children,"" Anderson said. ""And after he did, he would in some way act out on them -- either at the schools, at the events, on trips, at a variety of locations. And in some instances, he raped or assaulted them."" He added, ""This is about an institutional failure by many over decades to heed the warning signs and to protect the kids and, instead of protecting the kids, many, many adults chose to protect the reputation."" Attorney Ben Andreozzi, who represents one of Sandusky's alleged victims, said in a statement issued after Sandusky's television interview that his client ""fully intends to testify that he was severely sexually assaulted by Mr. Sandusky."" The lawyer said more information would be forthcoming. Washington civil rights law firm Katz, Marshall and Banks issued a statement Thursday saying it is working with Shubin and Seth Kreimer, a law professor, to formulate a civil case against Penn State. Earlier this week, Sandusky's attorney told CNN he was expecting other people hoping to take advantage of the situation to come forward with claims. During an investigation into the allegations, authorities found that Second Mile records, including travel and expense reports, were missing from about 2000 to about 2003, The New York Times reported Thursday, citing two sources with knowledge of the case. The records were supposed to be stored at an off-site facility, it said. Records from one of the years were later found after apparently having been misfiled, the Times said. ""It could be that they were just lost, but under the circumstances it is suspicious,"" one law enforcement official told the newspaper. The alleged rape witnessed by McQueary, who was then a graduate assistant, was detailed in the grand jury report. According to the report, McQueary told Paterno; Paterno then alerted his boss, Curley. The grand jury report also indicates that McQueary talked to Schultz and that Schultz never presented the information to university police. Preliminary hearings for Curley and Schultz were set for December 6 in Dauphin County Magistrate Court. CNN's Mary Snow, Jason Carroll and Sarah Hoye contributed from State College.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A series of photographic exhibitions have been organized in Europe and North America this autumn to highlight a campaign by Britain's Prince Charles to combat tropical deforestation. An aerial of Jambi Province, Indonesia showing the destruction of the tropical rainforest. The photographs were taken by world-renowned environment photographer Daniel Beltra who was this year's winner of the Prince's Rainforest Project Award at the Sony World Photography Awards earlier this year. The images graphically depict the effects of climate change on the rainforests in the South America, Africa and Indonesia. Beltra compiled a library of around 40,000 images during month long trips to the Amazon Basin, the Congolese Forest and Borneo and Sumatra in Southeast Asia. When he returned home Beltra produced a shortlist of around 1000 images from which the final exhibition photos were selected. ""I shoot a lot when I'm in the air,"" Beltra told CNN. ""Trying to concentrate on a small detail on the ground when your flying at a speed of 150 knots is difficult."" And that's not the only problem Beltra encountered. The very acts of destruction he was documenting often got in the way of his work.  Click here to see a selection of images from the exhibition » . ""When you are photographing deforestation, you are taking a lot of pictures of logging and fires and the smoke can make it very difficult to shoot."" Beltra was born in Spain but is now based in the United States. His work, which includes freelancing for the international environmental group Greenpeace, has taken him to over 50 countries and he is a fellow of the International League of Conservation Photographers. HRH Prince Charles has long been a passionate defender of the environment and he founded the Prince's Rainforest Project (PRP) in 2007. The PRP works alongside governments, international businesses, non-profit organizations and rainforest nations to find a solution to the deforestation and degradation of the rainforests. Speaking at the Sony Awards in Cannes, France earlier this year the Prince said: ""Photographic images can tell a compelling story about the truth of the situation, and the truth is that if we lose the fight against tropical deforestation, then we lose the fight against climate change."" Beltra hopes that his pictures will raise further awareness of the perils that humans face in the wake of continued rainforest destruction. ""I think we are all getting more aware but we really need to get our act together because at the moment we are destroying more than we are protecting,"" he said. The multimedia exhibitions organized by Sony are taking place at the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew in London, the Hotel de Ville, Paris, the Alexa Center, Berlin and the Mercy Corps Action Center, New York.","New photography exhibition showcases the destruction of the rainforests .

"(CNN) -- Sebastian Vettel has blazed a trail in Formula One's history books by becoming the youngest double world champion, but his Red Bull team bosses are already looking for their next star driver. The all-conquering Austrian marque, along with the 11 other teams on the F1 grid, are in Abu Dhabi for three days of testing with some of the brightest young talents in motorsport. Having remained at the Yas Marina Circuit following Sunday's grand prix, which was won by McLaren's Lewis Hamilton, the teams will put a number of potential future world champions through their paces between Tuesday and Thursday. Champion Vettel toasts dream year . One such prospect is Jean-Eric Vergne, the 21-year-old Toro Rosso test driver who finished second in the 2011 Formula Renault 3.5 series and has been given the chance to drive Red Bull's imperious RB7 car. Despite having an unfamiliar name at the wheel, the results on Tuesday bore an uncanny resemblance to those which have been witnessed in the sport for the last two years. Red Bull once again left the other teams trailing in their wake, only this time it was French youngster Vergne leading the field -- his lap of one minute 40.011 seconds beating Ferrari test driver Jules Bianchi into second place. ""That was a fantastic day for me,"" Vergne, who will drive for Red Bull on all three days, told the sport's official website. ""Driving the world championship-winning car is just great and I liked every lap I did out there. Latest F1 standings after Abu Dhabi GP . Bianchi has been handed the chance to take to the track for legendary Italian marque Ferrari at the test event for the second year in a row. ""It's great to be back at the wheel of a Ferrari on a real track,"" the 22-year-old said. The Frenchman also races for Lotus ART in the GP2 Series, where he has ended the season third after one victory and five podium finishes. The GP2 Series has long been a production line for F1 talent, with the competition having been the brainchild of former Formula One commercial rights holder Bernie Ecclestone and one-time Renault boss Flavio Briatore. ""I've already driven this car for some aerodynamic testing, but doing it at a real test is a whole different story,"" Bianchi said. ""Now, I am looking forward to a further two days of testing and we hope to carry on as we have started, with a lot of kilometers completed and trouble-free running."" Venezuela's Rodolfo Gonzalez is another GP2 graduate being given his chance to shine, taking to the cockpit for the CNN-sponsored Team Lotus on Tuesday. The 25-year-old hopes to emulate compatriot and Williams driver Pastor Maldonado in moving from the GP2 Asia Series to become the fifth driver from the South American country to compete in F1. ""It's my dream to drive in Formula One so I'm really very thankful for this opportunity,"" said Gonzalez. ""I think I've showed I have potential with the lap times I did, and am pleased with my times overall. ""I've proved I can do the job and have really enjoyed this experience in the car and learned a lot for my future. ""Knowing there are two more days still to do, just makes me smile more. It's a great opportunity ... I'm trying to learn as much as possible and get as much as possible out of it."" British team Williams are running GP3 champion Valtteri Bottas of Finland and Formula Two titleholder Mirko Bortolotti of Italy. ""I really enjoyed my first time driving the car on a proper track today,"" the 22-year-old Bottas said. ""It didn't take too long to get used to the car but there were still a few new things for me. There is much more downforce and power than the cars I am used to driving, but I really liked it and I think the day went well.""","The 12 Formula One teams are testing young drivers in Abu Dhabi .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Islamic militants have moved fighters to the Somali border town of Afmado in an effort to combat Kenyan forces who have entered Somalia, the militant group Al-Shabaab said Tuesday. The group said it viewed the Kenyan forces crossing of the joint border as ""an affront to Somalia's territorial sovereignty."" This move of fighters, which started Monday, comes after the militant group had threatened to ""come into Kenya"" if Kenyan forces did not leave Somalia. ""Kenyan troops have entered 100 kilometers into Somalia, and their planes are bombarding and killing residents,"" Sheikh Ali Mahmud Ragi, spokesman for Al-Shabaab, said in an online message posted on a jihadist website this week. ""We shall come into Kenya if you do not go back."" In response, the Kenyan and Somali governments issued a joint communique declaring Al-Shabaab ""a common enemy to both countries."" They pledged to work together to stabilize Somalia and cooperate in security and military operations. Kenyan forces crossed into Somalia to pursue Al-Shabaab fighters after the recent abductions of tourists and aid workers in Kenya heightened tensions in East Africa. Kenya invoked the U.N. charter allowing military action in self-defense against its largely lawless neighbor. The abductions are part of a ""recent spate of blatant attacks"" that are part of ""a changed strategy by Al-Shabaab calculated to terrorize civilians,"" the communique said. ""If you are attacked by an enemy, you have to pursue that enemy through hot pursuit and to try (to) hit wherever that enemy is,"" said Kenyan Defense Minister Yusuf Haji in a news conference that aired Sunday on CNN affiliate NTV. Al-Shabaab, which is linked to al Qaeda, has been fighting to impose its interpretation of Islamic law, or sharia, on Somalia. The group issued a statement Tuesday, however, denying responsibility for the abductions. ""These are mere suppositions unfounded in any solid evidence,"" the statement said. ""Kenyan authorities have been seeking justification for an aggressive incursion on to Somali territory."" On September 11, armed bandits broke into a beachfront cottage where Britons Judith and David Tebbutt, both in their 50s, were staying. David Tebbutt was shot dead while trying to resist the attack. His wife was grabbed and spirited away on a speedboat, and is believed to have been taken into Somalia. On October 1, pirates made another cross-border raid, this time snatching a French woman in her 60s from a holiday home on Manda Island where she lived part of the year. Earlier this month, gunmen abducted two Spanish workers from the medical charity Doctors Without Borders from the Dadaab refugee complex, about 80 kilometers (about 50 miles) from the Somali border. Kenya announced its new tactics days after African Union forces claimed victory against Al-Shabaab in the Somali capital of Mogadishu. The military said last week it had taken the remaining Al-Shabaab strongholds in the far northeast of the city. ""The challenge is now to protect civilians from the sort of terror attack we saw last week, as they attempt to rebuild their lives,"" said Lt. Col. Paddy Ankunda, spokesman for the African Union Mission in Somalia. He was referring to a suicide truck bombing in Mogadishu this month that left dozens dead. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility. Other Al-Shabaab attacks that week led to the deaths of at least 10 civilians. Federal and African Union forces have battled Al-Shabaab in the impoverished and chaotic nation for years. Many analysts believe the military push has severely affected Al-Shabaab, along with targeted strikes against organization members and the weakening of al Qaeda. Al-Shabaab said in August it was withdrawing from Mogadishu, and Somalia's Transitional Federal Government, backed by African Union peacekeepers, now controls most districts of the capital, the U.N. office has said. However, the group still poses a threat, Ankunda has said.","NEW: Kenyan and Somali governments pledging cooperation in Al-Shabaab fight .

"Washington (CNN) -- If you're on your way to some of the nation's airports this holiday season and have a feeling there are fewer people schlepping their suitcases and looking for long-term parking spaces, it's not your imagination. The estimate for the upcoming winter holiday travel period predicts there will be fewer fliers than a year ago. A projected 43.3 million air travelers will fly on U.S. carriers for both domestic and international routes during a 21-day period, according to Airlines for America (A4A), the industry trade organization for the leading U.S. airlines. That's a 1% drop from the same period last year which translates to about 20,000 fewer travelers on average per day. However, travelers will not find that translates into more leg room once they board planes. On the busiest days, flights will be filled to at least 85% capacity, according to the forecast. ""Passengers still should expect to see full flights as many airlines have reduced capacity to match the decline in travel and increased cost of operations. Capacity reduction is one of the steps the industry is taking to preserve profitability,"" said A4A Chief Economist John Heimlich. Lingering economic concerns, higher energy prices and less disposable income have all contributed to the slight decrease this winter, officials said. The large weather system currently blasting parts of the West and Midwest is making driving through the southern Rockies dangerous but forecasters say to this point, it has not had a major impact on large airline hubs. However, forecasters are watching it closely. ""All hands are on deck and ready to go,"" said Tom Hendricks, A4A senior vice president for Safety, Security and Operations. In the event winter weather causes problems, the FAA may open up Defense Department airspace not regularly available to commercial flights on an as-needed basis to help ease congestion. Daily passenger volumes are expected to range from 1.6 million to 2.3 million during the holiday. The busiest days are expected to be between December 21 through December 23, December 26 through December 30 and then January 2 and 3 as travelers fly home. The airline organization recommends passengers check airline websites before they leave for the airport, pack gifts unwrapped to lessen security delays and review carry-on rules for liquids, gels and aerosols.","A projected 43.3 million air travelers will fly on U.S. carriers .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Lindsay Lohan's need for a better toothpaste should not outshine more important issues ""such as homelessness, lack of funding for public education and relations between America and its allies,"" the actress's rep said Friday. Steve Honig was responding to online buzz about a close up photo of Lohan's teeth that appear to show stains that bloggers blame on her love of red wine and cigarettes. ""Lindsay is widely recognized as one of the most beautiful women on the planet, and is regularly sought-after by some of the top photographers in the world to appear on covers of magazines around the globe,"" Honig said in a statement to CNN. Not to mention the many paparazzi that hound Lohan through the streets of Los Angeles. ""There are so many more important issues the media should be focusing on, such as homelessness, lack of funding for public education and relations between America and its allies,"" Honig said. Stained teeth, however, is not Lohan's biggest concern now. She is due back in court Wednesday morning for a status hearing before Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Stephanie Saunter. Judge Saunter will check on her progress in meeting the community service and psychological counseling requirements she imposed last summer when she sentenced Lohan to probation for stealing a necklace from a Venice, California, jewelry store. As with Lohan's smile, there are online reports that her record of probation compliance is stained and that Lohan again faces jail time. But Frank Mateljan, spokesman for the Los Angeles City Attorney, said that while he has seen the reports the matter ""not risen to the level of having our office involved yet."" The probation office and the court have not contacted the prosecutor on the case about it, Mateljan said. Lohan lawyer Shawn Holley would not comment on the reports.","Tabloid photo shows Lohan stained teeth .

"(CNN)  -- Thomas Sawyer, a cancer survivor, has worn a urostomy bag for the past three years. Yet, he says, little could have prepared him for his recent airport pat down, when an officer broke the bag's seal and urine spilled out ""onto my shirt and down my pants."" ""I'm a good American. I know why we're doing this, and I understand it,"" Sawyer told CNN. ""But this was extremely embarrassing, and it didn't have to happen. With educated TSA workers, it wouldn't have happened."" With the height of Thanksgiving holiday travel the next two days, the Transportation Security Administration is trying to strike a delicate balance between ensuring the safety of the traveling public and not invading people's privacy rights. But the screening raises an array of questions from health-care professionals: . • Are TSA officers trained to deal with patients like Sawyer who may have medical conditions? • What about the elderly and others with hip replacements and similar ailments? • Will cancer patients have to take off wigs? • How is the TSA dealing with pat downs of children? • What about people with mental illness? The TSA says it has taken all of these concerns into account -- that children are not to be separated from their parents if pat downs are deemed necessary and that travelers with medical conditions should be treated with ""the dignity, respect and courtesy they deserve."" Watch: Cancer survivor accepts TSA apology . ""Our program covers all categories of disabilities -- mobility, hearing, visual and hidden,"" the TSA says on its website. ""As part of that program, we established a coalition of over 70 disability-related groups and organizations to help us understand the concerns of persons with disabilities and medical conditions."" Jonathan Bricker, a psychologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Washington state, says he advises anyone traveling right now to come mentally prepared for the unexpected. ""Go in with an expectation that this is going to happen, and go in with the expectation that you're going to be the one singled out to go through a pat down,"" Bricker says. By doing that, people ""can take more control of the situation."" He says people with medical conditions should also carry notes from their doctors. If a tense situation does arise while being screened, passengers should think about the big picture, he says. ""There is a larger purpose to this trip that has nothing to do with the TSA and nothing to do with the government. And the purpose is: You're visiting people you love."" The TSA has said the ramped-up use of pat downs and full-body scanning is necessary to prevent weapons and explosives from getting aboard planes. The White House on Monday said the process is evolving and that the government is taking into account the public's concerns. ""The evolution of the security will be done with the input of those who go through the security,"" White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said. Recent polls have shown most Americans support the measures, and a periphery glance at airports nationwide shows that the vast majority of travelers are dealing well with the extra scrutiny, even if it makes them uneasy at times. Dr. Gina Villani, the head of oncology at The Brooklyn Hospital Center, says the extra scrutiny raises concerns for cancer patients, who could have metallic dishes for chemo placed under their skin, external catheters or other necessary medical devices on their bodies. ""You can imagine during a pat down, you're feeling this piece of metal under somebody's skin. If you don't know what it is, then it's going to create a lot of problems for people,"" she said. Doctors must be more aware of when their patients are traveling and write notes explaining their conditions, she says. Most of the time, though, ""patients only think about it after they've had a terrible experience."" A doctor's note also carries a demoralizing stigma. ""You want to go on vacation and forget you have cancer,"" Villani says. ""It's just one more reminder of how different you are from the rest of the population."" Another area of concern is the pat down of children. Craig Fabrikant, a psychologist at Hackensack University Medical Center, has simple advice for the TSA: Have officers trained to deal with children on shift at all times, and always have the parent or guardian undergo a pat down first, in front of the child. ""Why not let the child see the parent go through it, that it's no big deal, that it's fine,"" Fabrikant says. He says it's simple and practical advice, but he's doubtful any of it will be used. After all, he says, it's big government. ""Not only does it not use common sense, it doesn't move that quickly."" To the agency's credit, TSA administrator John Pistole called Sawyer to apologize Monday after he learned of the incident. The two had a cordial conversation, and Sawyer even shared some advice. ""He asked me what I thought,"" Sawyer said. ""So I talked to him -- that I really don't believe that they've been trained as well as [they could] to handle medical conditions.""","TSA says pat downs, full-body scans are necessary to prevent weapons from getting on planes .

"(PEOPLE.com) -- ""Rush Hour"" star Chris Tucker's $6 million Florida mansion is in foreclosure, with more than $4.4 million owed to the bank, reports the Orlando Sentinel, citing papers filed in Circuit Court in Lake County.

The newspaper says the residence contains five bedrooms, three fireplaces, a personal spa, an outdoor kitchen overlooking a pool, and a basement outfitted to resemble a pirate ship, including the sail. Court documents reportedly show an $11.5 million IRS lien on the home in 2011 in order to collect federal income taxes from Tucker, whose monthly mortgage payment, the documents also show, was $25,812.50.

"(CNN) -- Syria's President Bashar al-Assad looks more isolated with each passing day as his regime continues a bloody eight-month crackdown on pro-democracy protests. His Arab neighbors signaled their displeasure with him this week by suspending Syria from the Arab League, a stinging blow for a nation that sees itself at the heart of Arab concerns. Jordan's King Abdullah went a step further, telling the BBC he would step down if he were al-Assad, an unusually blunt assessment that followed Western calls for al-Assad to go. And Turkey, formerly an important ally and trading partner, threatened to cut off electricity supplies to Syria as the European Union moved this week to extend sanctions against more members of al-Assad's circle. This week, the conflict inside Syria entered a new era when army defectors attacked pro-government targets. That ratcheted up the pressure even more -- the Russian foreign minister was widely quoted as saying attacks on government buildings in Syria resembled ""civil war."" So can al-Assad cling to power? Or will he become the fourth leader forced from office in the Arab Spring, following in the footsteps of ousted leaders of Egypt, Libya and Tunisia? Analysts say that the odds are stacked against Syria's president. Steven A. Cook, Hasib J. Sabbagh senior fellow for Middle Eastern studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, said it is hard to predict what might come next for al-Assad -- but the pressure is on. ""The kind of traditional support he had externally is clearly crumbling,"" Cook said. ""His prospects this week are worse than they were last week."" Emile Hokayem, senior fellow for regional security at the Bahrain office of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, thinks it highly unlikely al-Assad will hang on to power. Three main factors will likely contribute to the downfall of Syria's president after 11 years in power, he said. One is that he has lost legitimacy in the eyes of his own people. ""It's hard to see how he would recover his legitimacy after killing almost 4,000 of his countrymen,"" said Hokayem. The United Nations puts the toll of deaths at well over 3,500 since protests began. Second is the economy, as sanctions imposed by the West and Turkey start to bite. This matters, said Hokayem, because al-Assad may struggle to keep the support of the country's urban and business elites in Damascus and Aleppo if the economy is failing. The third factor is security, despite al-Assad's mobilization of the military. Unlike previous challenges to the al-Assad regime, ""this time it's the Syrian people leading it and very clearly regime change is their goal and they are not going to accept anything less,"" Hokayem said. Shashank Joshi, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies (RUSI), also doubts al-Assad will survive -- but says it is far from clear what might follow. The Arab League's decision to suspend Syria, after Damascus failed to abide by a peace deal that had been brokered earlier with the 22-nation league, signals a shift in views that would have looked extremely unlikely even a month ago, he says. The regime's military is also increasingly over-extended as those fighting against it find footholds in Lebanese and Turkish soil, he said. Turkey might also choose to intervene more directly, perhaps by creating a buffer zone along its long border with Syria or providing weapons to the rebels, he said. At this point, descent into civil war could be as likely a scenario as a clean change of regime at the top, he said. Nonetheless, Joshi cautioned against thinking the 46-year-old's grip on power will be loosened immediately, pointing to the example of Iraq's former dictator, Saddam Hussein. In 1991, he said, Hussein had just lost a major war, had two no-fly zones, U.N. sanctions and an oil embargo imposed on his country, was facing an enormous Shia uprising in the south, and endured overwhelming diplomatic isolation. ""And yet he survived for 12 years,"" Joshi said. ""Regimes that are used to being isolated, that are used to being under sanctions and under pressure, can be extremely resilient."" Joshi also points out that while al-Assad may well be forced out, that doesn't necessarily mean the regime will fall with him. Bashar al-Assad is not as well entrenched as was his father, the late President Hafez al-Assad, who ruled with an iron fist for three decades -- and it's possible other members of his ruling Alawite sect might decide to throw their hat in with his brother Maher, an army commander, or parts of the military instead, Joshi said. ""They might even decide to get rid of Bashar al-Assad to save themselves, and portray it as a concession, or compromise,"" he said. He cites the example of Egypt, where the Arab Spring uprising may have forced President Hosni Mubarak from power in February but the military leadership has not yet handed over power to a democratically elected government. Salman Shaikh, director of the Brookings Doha Center, also predicts that al-Assad will eventually go -- but that his regime will cling on for as long as possible, with Syria following the example of Libya rather than that of Tunisia, where ousted President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali fled to Saudi Arabia. Shaikh sees ""the makings of a very powerful coalition"" lined up against al-Assad, uniting the Arab nations, Turkey, the United States and Europe, which could move ""quite forcefully"" to sanctions. And al-Assad has few friends to whom he can turn for help. One key question is how long Syria can still count on the support of Russia, a historic ally and a major arms supplier to Damascus. Moscow, which sold $3.8 billion of weapons to Syria last year -- 10% of its total arms sales, is ""giving a lifeline"" to al-Assad at the moment, said Shaikh, largely by delaying international action. If Moscow opposes efforts to impose U.N. Security Council sanctions on Syria, as anticipated, international efforts to present a unified stance -- as on NATO action to protect civilians in Libya -- will be thwarted. ""The same action can be viewed as a just war or an act of imperial aggression depending on whether Russia allows a U.N. resolution to be passed,"" Joshi said. Germany, France and Britain will hand in a draft U.N. resolution Thursday condemning the Syrian government's actions, a German diplomatic spokesman in New York told CNN on Wednesday. Diplomats from Arab countries are considering co-sponsoring the resolution. An attempt this week by a Syrian opposition group to persuade Russian officials to shift their position and demand al-Assad's resignation appears to have gone nowhere, with Moscow instead reiterating a call for peaceful dialogue to resolve the situation. China also has a history of opposing U.N action but appears at the moment to be hedging its bets on Syria, probably in the interests of stability in the region, Joshi added. Iran has in the past few days given a strong statement of support for al-Assad, Shaikh of the Brookings Doha Center said, but Tehran may still in the end be pragmatic and seek to build ties with the Syrian opposition. Perhaps the biggest danger ahead, the analysts say, is that whether al-Assad goes or not, Syria is teetering on the brink of civil war, as opposition elements such as the Free Syrian army turn to arms to combat pro-government forces. Such violence lessens the chance of a peaceful resolution to the uprising and smooth shift to democracy -- and will undoubtedly lead to greater loss of life. ""We are entering into a new phase now in the Syrian situation,"" said Shaikh. ""We are seeing a greater militarization. ""I think the window for an orderly transition is over and now it will be a mixture of international pressure and whatever support is given to these protesters and even those fighting against the regime. ""The main game for the foreseeable future will focus on the protection of civilians, and measures to ensure that, as we saw in the Libyan case."" CNN's Joe Sterling contributed to this report.","The Arab Spring has forced three leaders from power so far .

"(CNN)  -- Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo has been ruled out of Portugal's crucial final World Cup qualifier against Malta on Wednesday with an ankle injury and could be sidelined for up to a month. Cristiano Ronaldo holds his ankle before going off in Portugal's win over Hungary. Ronaldo played with the injury in Portugal's 3-0 home victory over Hungary on Saturday but lasted just 27 minutes before limping off. Portugal, who have made a late charge in World Cup qualifying after looking set to make an ignominious exit, need to beat Malta in the home game to be sure of a place in the European playoffs. The Portugal federation said they had allowed Ronaldo to leave the squad, while Spanish giants Real confirmed the bad news in a statement on Sunday. ""After a clinical examination and an MRI scan, it is confirmed the player has suffered a recurrence of his injury to his right ankle, a medial collateral sprain with inflammation in the bone,"" the club said. ""The estimated recovery time is three to four weeks."" Denmark have an unassailable lead in Group One after beating Scandinavian rivals Sweden 1-0 on Saturday. The results almost certainly means the departure of Swedish coach Lars Lagerback, who said on Sunday that he will resign if his team fail to qualify for the World Cup finals in South Africa. Roland Andersson, Lagerback's assistant, has also signaled he will go if results go against them on Wednesday. ""Roland and I will resign depending on the result, either after the World Cup in South Africa, after the playoffs or after the (last) qualifier against Albania,"" Lagerback said. The Swedes are now third in the group, a point behind Portugal, and face Albania in their final match. They must hope that Portugal, missing Ronaldo, slip up against Malta, while beating Albania. Meanwhile, Ronaldo's former Manchester United teammate Wayne Rooney has been ruled out of England's final World Cup qualifier against Belarus with a calf strain. Rooney picked up the injury in England's 1-0 defeat in the Ukraine. England have already qualified for the finals.","Cristiano Ronaldo to miss Portugal's final World Cup qualifying match .

"(CNN) -- A total of 46 inmates were injured during a prison riot at the North Fork Correctional Facility in western Oklahoma, but there were no fatalities, prison officials said Wednesday. Multiple fights had broken out in the 2,500-bed facility on Tuesday, but order was restored and the facility was completely locked down, according to a statement by Corrections Corporation of America, which runs the prison. As of Wednesday there were no reports of staff injuries, CCA said. Regarding the injuries, 16 inmates were transported to facilities outside the prison for treatment, including one who has already returned to the facility. Another 30 inmates were treated on-site by medical staff, CCA said. While the riot was taking place, a morgue was set up in a tent outside the prison, though there were no fatalities. Aerial video of the scene from CNN affiliate KOCO showed armed officials holding prisoners at gunpoint. The prison is located in Sayre, about halfway between Oklahoma City and Amarillo, Texas. CNN's Chandler Friedman contributed to this report.","There were multiple fights reported inside North Fork Correctional Facility .

"(CNN) -- This week, ""American Idol"" Season 10 winner Scotty McCreery releases his debut album, ""Clear as Day."" As one would expect, the record's 12 songs feature his deep crooning voice paired with lyrics about new love and small town aspirations. Fans of the teen should come away satisfied with this first effort, in that it's pretty much what one might expect from a young musician with a gifted voice who one day found himself with a sizable record advance and access to coveted Nashville session players. The 17-year-old McCreery is juggling his senior year of high school this fall along with promoting his album. So just how exactly does that work? CNN spoke with McCreery from his home in Garner, North Carolina, about just that as well as young love, and what drink he will walk miles to enjoy. CNN: You're just starting your senior year in high school. What's the class schedule like? Scotty McCreery: They didn't want me to have the first block because they didn't want me to be a distraction to kids getting to school. So I go in the second block and am there for the rest of the day. Next semester's going to be the tough one. I have AP English and all that jazz. CNN: How's this work: You go on the ""American Idol"" tour, have amazing catering and then have to come back to cafeteria food? McCreery: (Laughs) Yeah, the catering was amazing on the tour ... I probably gained a few pounds I'll have to run off. But they let us go off campus, the juniors and seniors; we have a really big school and the cafeteria can't fit us all in there. We go out to Bojangles or Chick-fil-A. But we had Mexican food today, El Dorado's. CNN: Tell me about recording ""Clear as Day."" McCreery: Oh yeah, it was a lot of fun. It was kind of like the traveling studio, you know. We started off in Nashville and recorded a bunch of songs and once we got the tracks laid down, when I was on tour, whatever city I was in we'd stop by a studio and they'd bring the equipment from Nashville and we'd lay down some vocals and then on to the next. CNN: Looking back, does the record evoke certain themes? McCreery: Yeah, we were talking about this today, actually. It's got a cool thing about love. Not necessarily the boy-girl love or anything; it talks about everyday love, it talks about family love with kids and parents, love with loss, love for my hometown on ""Water Tower Town."" It's not necessarily one theme of love, but it's got a lot of influences. It's a cool way that I like to think of it. CNN: It's very much rooted in what someone you're age would be going through: Summer love, figuring out girls, football games. McCreery: For me, an emotion is an emotion, whether you're 70 or 17. At 70, you might have much more experience with it and know a little bit more about it, but if a 17 year old says they have a broken heart, in my eyes, they have one. CNN: And those are some of the worst kinds. McCreery: Oh, they're horrible, absolutely horrible. CNN: Some country records are riddled with clichÃ©s; how do you avoid those? McCreery: The whole clichÃ© thing people think about country music, you know, ""drinking with the boys"" it isn't country music at all. Country music is real and talks about real-life situations and I think with this record we did that. There's a song called ""Back on the Ground"" and it can talk about a college student or someone like me, where you want to get of town and go live life but then when you're at it for awhile, you can't wait to get back. I've been at home for maybe 10 days since February and any time I can get a chance to get home, it's a blessing. CNN: Does going into this genre after ""American Idol"" give you a leg up versus other people coming out of that show that make a pop or an R&B record? McCreery: You know, I'm not so sure exactly on that. But country fans are really loyal and they were really supportive of me. I didn't do the honky-tonk in the traditional way, but now, I'm the newbie in country music. I was the ""American Idol"" and all that, but now I'm making the transition and I'm low down the ranks. Just like the senior in high school who becomes the freshman in college. I got to work hard and hopefully get my sea legs and stay around for a bit. CNN: Obviously, your voice is the bread and butter. How do you take care of it these days? McCreery: On the road it was tough, singing every night and talking a lot. We had this thing called Throat Coat that we'd drink a lot. Anytime I don't have to be yellin' or talking, I'm trying to ease off on it. I'm using it a lot and I don't want to hurt it. It's my instrument. CNN: You mentioned the song ""Water Tower Town"" -- it might be one of the only songs that gives a shout out to sweet tea. McCreery: I think that was the only one. I was the guy on 'Idol' that walked six miles to [get some tea]. There was a time that I was going to go to McDonald's because that was the only place in California you could find sweet tea. I took a right instead of a left, and I ended up walking six miles to get some sweet tea. I kept thinking as I was walking ""Man this is a long mile.""","Season 10 ""American Idol"" winner Scotty McCreery has a debut album .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- As the death toll climbed Monday from flooding in Southeast Asia, officials beefed up flood prevention measures to protect Thailand's capital from rising water. Millions have been affected by the flooding in Thailand and Cambodia, which has been hit by an above-average monsoonal rainy season. As of Monday, 269 people were dead in Thailand and four were missing, according to the country's Flood Relief Operations Command. Another 207 people were dead in Cambodia, according to the country's state-run news agency AKP. Patients in two hospitals in Thailand's Ayutthaya and Nakhon Sawan provinces had to be evacuated after water reached the first floor, the flood operations command said. Multiple tropical systems have moved over the area in recent weeks, enhancing monsoon rains and leading to the flooding. Another low pressure system is forecast to move into Southeast Asia on Tuesday and Wednesday, said Brandon Miller, senior meteorologist for CNN International. On Monday, Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra ordered canal dredging and reinforcement of flood-prevention embankments to protect Bangkok, state-run news agency MCOT reported. In addition, three new flood-prevention walls were being built at two locations in Rangsit, in northern Bangkok, and in Taling Chan, in the western part of the city. The government needs another 1.5 million sandbags, MCOT reported. The prime minister called on the private sector to supply them, but said the government will buy all the needed sandbags by Wednesday, the news agency said. The Rojana Industrial Park has halted operations for the time being, director Amara Charoengitwattanagun told MCOT, and the facility may be further damaged if the flooding worsens. One plant in the park, Single Point Parts, evacuated all workers from the premises and built flood prevention embankments around its building, according to MCOT. Meanwhile, Honda Thailand said on its website Monday that its plants in the Rojana park are flooded and will be closed until at least until the end of the week.","Nearly 500 people are dead in Thailand and Cambodia .

"Moscow (CNN) -- Russian election authorities officially registered Prime Minister Vladimir Putin Monday as a candidate for president in next year's election, they announced on their website. Putin will represent his United Russia party, the Central Election Commission said. The move is the latest step toward Putin's reclaiming the presidency after switching to the prime minister's office because of a law barring him from serving more than two consecutive terms as president. Russia's third-richest man, the billionaire New Jersey Nets owner Mikhail Prokhorov, announced this month that he will run against Putin for president. Many ordinary Russians suspect the Kremlin put Prokhorov up to it to give the impression the contest is fair. Last week, Putin brushed off widespread criticism that the December 4 parliamentary elections in Russia were falsified. He said their results ""reflect the actual line-up of forces in the country, as well as the fact that the ruling force -- the United Russia party -- has lost certain positions."" Tens of thousands turned out to protest the election results that returned Putin's United Russia party to power, but with a smaller majority. Police estimated crowds in Moscow on December 10 at 25,000, while organizers said the total was 40,000, the state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported. Either figure would make the protests the largest in the Russian capital in 20 years. Claiming the results of parliamentary elections were rigged, protesters chanted ""Putin out."" They also braved freezing temperatures in other Russian cities to demonstrate against what they said was vote fraud. Putin said in his question-and-answer session that protesters were positioning themselves for the presidential vote in March. ""It is obvious to me that the attacks on the latest election are secondary; their primary goal is the next election, the Russian presidential election,"" Putin said December 15. The Organization for Security and Cooperation said in a preliminary report that some political parties had been prevented from running and the vote was ""slanted in favor of the ruling party."" Its election-observer mission detailed alleged attempts to stuff ballot boxes, manipulate voter lists and harass election monitors. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also said the United States had ""serious concerns"" about the election and called for a ""full investigation"" of apparent irregularities.","Putin is angling to return to the office he used to hold .

"London (CNN) -- On a brownfield site in east London, not far from the site of the 2012 Olympic Park, a new green vision is emerging from the ashes of the UK capital's dirty industrial past. Once the home of a coal-fired power station, the London Sustainable Industries Park (SIP) at Dagenham Dock is creating the largest concentration of environmental businesses in the UK. The concept to transform the area into a clean-tech hub was originally devised by the local government authority (Barking and Dagenham) who were keen to promote jobs and prosperity in the wake of cutbacks at automaker Ford's Dagenham car plant. Since 2007, the London Thames Gateway Development Corporation (LTGDC) -- a UK government agency tasked with overseeing regeneration of areas all over east London -- has been securing planning consent for the site's infrastructure. But that's not all they're doing says Mark Bradbury, LTGDC's deputy director of development. ""We're also putting in a lot more landscape infrastructure ... creating an environment which is much more business park than industrial estate,"" he said. So along with industrial units which meet BREEAM standards, there are swales and trees to help with water and air pollution, he says. A heat network is also being installed allowing some of the energy produced to be shared by businesses on site. The goal, says Bradbury, is industrial symbiosis. This sharing of material by-products, water and energy by local industries rather than importing resources from outside is an idea which has gained momentum over the past two decades, says Marian Chertow, associate professor of industrial environmental management at Yale University. ""Many urban areas with industrial concentrations find that symbiotic activities arise spontaneously as they are economically efficient for firms even before counting environmental benefits,"" Chertow said. ""Over time, and with some coordination, these can become extensive networks for resource sharing and community building,"" she added. A leading early adopter of this philosophy was the city of Kalundborg, Denmark. Established in 1972, their eco-industrial park has evolved ""from a single power station into a cluster of companies that rely on each other for material inputs,"" according to the International Institute for Sustainable Development. So although the London SIP isn't the first it is unique, Bradbury says. ""We believe we are the first park to actively set out to achieve this from the start -- to almost vet our occupiers from the outset to really look at how they will add to the mix and that they buy into the symbiosis ethos of shared inputs and outputs,"" he said. So far only one tenant -- plastics recycler Closed Loop Recycling -- is on site but others are set to move in next year. Waste-management company Cyclamax is scheduled to install a renewable-energy power plant creating 16 megawatts of electricity early in the new year, while TEG (an organic waste recycler) has been given the green light to develop an anaerobic digestion plant. Closed Loop Recycling, which handles 35,000 tons of plastic bottles every year, is looking forward to the eco-freindly synergies that its neighboring tenants will provide when they arrive. ""There is good potential that we will be able to take some of the heat from the anaerobic digester and composting facility to heat our wash water,"" said Nick Cliffe, marketing manager for Closed Loop Recycling. In return, bits of bottle that can't be recycled, including labels, could be sent over to Cyclamax's gasification plant, says Cliffe. He's also optimistic about future symbiotic relationships being formed with plastic upcyclers who are expected to join the park. ""It's a great site,"" Cliffe said. ""There's a real chance if the right kind of businesses come together that we can work stronger together rather than being more distributed."" The vision is that over the next 15-20 years the park can provide the area with a supply of green energy, Bradbury says, kick-starting renewed interest and investment in the area. ""The ultimate aim is to have a range of businesses which gradually get more and more high-tech as the cluster grows,"" he said.","Sustainable industries park in UK capital encourages green investment .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The largest single aviation purchase in Boeing's 94-year history was pulled off today by Lion Air. Lion who? If you have never heard of Lion Air, you're not alone. Unless you speak Bahasa Indonesia and have traveled around the vast array of islands that make up the world's most populous Muslim nation, there is no reason why you should have. With U.S. President Barack Obama watching on the sidelines of the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) economic summit in Bali, Lion Air signed a deal for 230 Boeing planes totaling $21.7 billion, with the first delivery in 2017 -- part of the airline's plan to buy 408 new planes at $37.7 billion, Lion Air CEO Rusdy Kirana told CNN. ""From east to west, Indonesia spans 5,000 miles and we have 230 million (people) and not enough aircraft to meet the growth of the number of passengers,"" Kirana said. Right now, the airline has only a few routes that take it out of Indonesia to Southeast Asian neighbors Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam. The airline plans to use the new fleet to both expand routes among the 6,000 inhabited islands in Indonesia as well as new routes to Japan, South Korea, China and Taiwan. While the developed world has been pummeled with recession, stagnant growth and rising debt burdens in the wake of the 2007-2008 Financial Crisis, developing powerhouses like Indonesia have continued to rise. Indonesia's economic output was $706.6 billion in 2010, up from just $95.4 billion in 1998 when the nation was embroiled in the Asian Financial Crisis, which led to the end of the longtime dictatorship of Indonesian President Suharto. His departure led the way for economic and political reform in the world's fourth most populous nation. The soaring fortunes of Indonesia echoes the number of Indonesians taking to the skies -- this year, the numbers traveling by air within the country is expected to rise 15%, the Indonesian Transportation Ministry said. ""As Indonesia's middle class increases in number, more and more people will be traveling throughout the archipelago,"" said Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa. ""And the easiest way to travel is air transport, and so that why I think the projection ahead will be quite promising, and offer many opportunities for many."" For Obama, the record deal helped him underline a message he's echoed during his Asian trip: That strong economic ties with Asia creates jobs at home. ""For the last several days, I've been talking about how we have to make sure that we've got a presence in this region, that it can result directly in jobs at home,"" Obama said in a statement. ""And what we see here -- a multibillion-dollar deal between Lion Air -- one of the fastest-growing airlines not just in the region, but in the world -- and Boeing is going to result in over 100,000 jobs back in the United States of America, over a long period of time."" When asked why Lion Air chose Boeing over arch rival, French-made Airbus, CEO Kirana told CNN: ""There's not much difference between Airbus and Boeing. It's like a person choosing what to eat. you just prefer one dish over another."" Executives at Boeing are no doubt pleased the Indonesian airline prefers to supper in Seattle rather than dine in France. And as fortunes rise on the archipelago, many more western companies will try to find a place at Indonesia's table.

"(CNN) -- A broadside against the dieting industry, Darryl Roberts' documentary isn't always pretty but it provides plenty of food for thought. Roberts cites Michael Moore as an example of a smart, successful fatty, and his filmmaking is in the same sometimes scattershot, first-person style. He's not shy about bringing his sister's struggles with in-vitro fertilization into the story, or filming his own medical appointments. Informed that at 270 pounds he's obese, with worryingly high blood pressure and an arrhythmic heartbeat, Roberts looks for a weight loss program that works for him. At the same time, he keeps an eye on the bigger picture. The statistics fly thick and fast: . 100 million Americans are obese. Four out of five women are dissatisfied with the way they look. On any given day almost 50% of women are on a diet . So are 25% of men. It all adds up to great news for a diet industry worth $50 billion a year. Not so great for the rest of us, because 95% of diets fail. This is obviously not a healthy situation, but Roberts has an interesting spin on some of these numbers. He makes a compelling case that the so-called obesity epidemic has been grossly inflated by the misapplication of the Body Mass Index (BMI), a one-size-fits-all formula which categorized 29 million previously healthy Americans as overweight or obese when the recommendations were changed in 1998. He shows that several members of the National Institutes for Health panel that approved the change are paid consultants to Weight Watchers, which benefited from the tighter guidelines. And he points out that according to the current BMI recommendations, LeBron James, Tom Cruise, Will Smith, Christian Bale and Arnold Schwarzenegger are all either overweight or obese. Rather than labeling citizens with a false standard, Roberts suggests government might have a bigger impact on the nation's weight-gain by cutting the corn subsidies that have injected the addictive and calorific high fructose corn syrup into so many of our food staples. He makes that point to Secretary of Health Kathleen Sibelius, and which she ducks at such length, he cheekily repeats the question in caption form under her rambling non-response. (The interview is shut down shortly afterward.) Meanwhile, as he fails at one diet after another, Roberts meets an anorexic thrown out of rehab by her insurance company, a realtor addicted to working out, and a group of high school boys recovering from eating disorders. He begins to wonder if our cultural prejudice against fat is doing more harm than good. ""America the Beautiful 2"" isn't as slick or polished as the better-funded films by Michael Moore or Morgan Spurlock. The doc itself could easily use a nip and a tuck, and Roberts opens up so many fronts he can't possibly do justice to them all. It's going to take a lot more than this movie to convince most people that fat isn't necessarily unhealthy. Even so, you'll be grateful for his efforts. Roberts is an immensely amiable, engaging personality who easily relates to people and seems to genuinely care. It's certainly refreshing that he's not trying to sell us anything except a more down to earth self-image and a less sedentary lifestyle. When he gets his own systolic blood pressure down from 160 to 116, not through dieting but exercise, you have to think he's on the right track.","Darryl Roberts' documentary follows his struggle to get healthy .

"(CNN) -- The state of Pennsylvania gave us Joe Montana, Broadway Joe Namath and Smokin' Joe Frazier. That's a lot of big-time Joes. But added together their moral authority would total a tiny fraction of that established over a half-century by Joe Paterno. If I didn't know Joe Paterno was a real person, I would swear he was invented, a character in a sports adventure novel written for boys in the 1950s. There he'd stand on the sidelines, hands behind his back, squinting in the sunlight, Joe Paterno, legendary coach at State College, the beacon of moral and physical courage, the shepherd of lost boys, pater familias in a place called Happy Valley. An author could not invent a better name: Joe Paterno. St. Joe, father of a holy family of student athletes. JoePa. Papa Joe. Pater, as in Latin for father. Eternal paternal Paterno. Our father, who art in trouble, hollow be thy name. You hear it all the time: ""Football is a religion in Pennsylvania"" (Or Texas or Florida). To the Penn State students rioting in the streets Wednesday night, Joe Paterno was pope, a word that also means father. Not only does pope denote the Catholic bishop of Rome, it now can describe, according to the American Heritage Dictionary, any ""person considered to have unquestioned authority."" The sacred role of the father as protector of the family is central to many cultures, including the Italian-American. This is not just a theory for me. Above my desk are three photographs: one of my grandfather, Peter Marino, as a young political candidate in New York City; another of the ship that carried his family from Italy to Ellis Island; a third, a copy of the ship's manifest, which lists him, at the age of 4, with his mother, father and two older sisters. They have 12 cents to their name. When in 1972 I called my grandfather (our name for him was Papa!) to announce the birth of his first great-grandchild, I could hear his tears, and then his words: ""Remember, Roy, the most important thing in life is family."" How many of us as children have invested our hopes and dreams in the patriarch? ""The father is head of the family,"" goes the familiar theological injunction, ""as God is head of the church."" What happens, then, when little Tony Soprano discovers that his beloved father is also the head of a Mafia family? La famiglia. What happens when a beloved father abandons a family, or shames it? Most of us can remember with exquisite regret the moment that our faith in a father or father figure was shattered, a loss that can carry dark consequences. Most institutions, even the Mafia, want to avoid scandal. The lower or higher the moral authority of that institution, the more that avoidance of scandal takes priority. Princes of the Catholic Church hid knowledge of sexual predation within their ranks, not because they wished harm to children, but because knowledge of that scandal would stain the soul of the Church -- and undermine its good works -- forever. Consider the Penn State scandal in the same light. Why didn't ""leaders of men"" call the police on Jerry Sandusky, now accused of sexual assault, one of their own? Not because they wanted boys to be raped in locker rooms. Silence and inaction ruled because exposure of abuse threatened to tear down everything that JoePa had built up, not just a team or athletic program, but a story he had written for the university: that honor, sportsmanship, academic achievement and traditional Christian American values could attach themselves to a multimillion dollar sports enterprise. Joe Paterno as BMOC: Big Man On Campus. Forever and ever. Amen. The word ""fan"" comes from ""fanatic."" The ""enthusiasm"" that rocks a stadium derives from the Greek word meaning ""to have God in you,"" a word that once carried the negative connotation of zealotry. If my connecting Penn State to the Catholic Church (and to the Mafia) strikes you as offensive or at least out of proportion, consider how Ancient Roman it all is. It is the Roman Catholic Church after all; and the Italian crime syndicates organized themselves like the Roman Legionnaires, with heads and heads of heads. As for Penn State? Just stroll around the ruins of the Coliseum in Rome. Bread and circuses has evolved into something a bit more civilized -- beer and football -- but the purpose remains the same: to entertain and distract through a quasi-religious communal experience, an emotional ritual that serves as a substitute for war. A famous sports editor, Stanley Woodward, told his reporters to stop ""godding up"" the athletes, to quit converting sweaty football players into the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. The time may have come, through the excruciating agony of innocent boys, to stop godding up the coaches, and to dismantle brick by brick the arrogance of those who would turn a sport into a religion. Commentators on sports television and radio have raised their sanctimonious voices to instruct us that this scandal is ""not about football."" That's like saying the sexual abuse of altar boys is ""not about religion."" The scandal at Penn State turns out to be -- as it always is -- more about the cover-up than the original crimes. The cover-up didn't work for Nixon, or Cardinal Law in Boston, or for Joseph Vincent Paterno. If JoePa has been the pope of the Church of College Football, he turned the rest of us into acolytes. How many of us learned to bow down and obey, leaving our skepticism outside the church door? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roy Peter Clark.","Roy Peter Clark: Legendary Penn State coach Paterno is like a mythical paternal figure .

"(CNN) -- A body found in a wooded area Tuesday is believed to be that of 11-year-old William McQuain, who went missing more than two weeks ago, Montgomery County, Maryland, police said. Search dog handlers found the body of a young African-American male in Clarksburg, Maryland, just after 9 a.m. Tuesday, police said in a statement. The scene was still being processed Tuesday morning, and police spokeswoman Rebecca Innocenti had no information on when a positive identification would be made. An Amber Alert was issued for the boy after his mother, Jane McQuain, 51, was found dead in the bedroom of her Germantown home October 12. She had been stabbed and beaten, according to police. Her son was not there, and her Honda CRV was gone, but police later recovered it. Police said the boy was last seen September 30 at his home. Authorities said Jane McQuain had been dead for about 10 to 12 days when her body was found. The discovery was made after a friend contacted police and said he had not been able to contact her and was concerned. Curtis Lopez, 45, was arrested last week in Charlotte, North Carolina, in connection with Jane McQuain's death. He waived extradition to Maryland on Monday. Police said Lopez was McQuain's husband and was often at her residence, although he did not appear to live there. Witnesses reported seeing him loading items into McQuain's vehicle recently, police said. Authorities obtained a surveillance tape from the morning of October 1 showing Lopez ""entering and re-entering"" a storage unit in Germantown with the boy, the police statement said. ""At that time, William McQuain appeared to be in a playful mood and showed no signs of distress."" ""The clothing that William McQuain was wearing in the video is similar to the clothing found on the body that was located,"" the statement said. The body is believed to have been in its location since October 1, authorities said. CNN's Devon Sayers contributed to this report.","William McQuain, 11, has been missing for more than two weeks .

"(RollingStone.com) -- Arcade Fire manager Scott Rodger has responded to allegations by media mogul Steve Stoute and record industry gadfly Bob Lefsetz that the band closed out the Grammy Awards this year with a second performance because the Recording Academy knew the group would win the ceremony's final award for Album of the Year. Grammy Awards: Complete Coverage . In an email to Lefsetz's newsletter The Lefsetz Letter, Rodger explained that the Arcade Fire performed last at the show because ratings are typically low at the end of the broadcast, and the band was one of the least-known acts on the bill. (He wrote that he would have preferred if the band had played earlier in the program.) Rodger also insisted that the band's second performance was not part of a ""big plot"" but rather an agreement with Grammy producers to play out the show's credits, depending on how much time was left in the broadcast. He said that the band was never guaranteed time at the end of the ceremony. Photos: Arcade Fire's Greatest Performances . Rodger later asserted that the Arcade Fire did not lobby for their Grammy in any way, and that the band, not its label Merge Records, paid their own overhead in order to perform at the event.

"(CNN) -- Actor Rainn Wilson is dedicated to improving the lives of young people around the world. The star of ""The Office"" works with the Mona Foundation, which supports educational initiatives for children in developing countries. He is also involved with Planting Peace's program to deworm children in Haiti. Wilson got to know Planting Peace's founder, Aaron Jackson, after Jackson was honored as a CNN Hero in 2007. CNN's Sonya Hamasaki recently sat down with Wilson to talk about CNN Heroes and his humanitarian work. Below are excerpts from that interview. Sonya Hamasaki: What inspired you to get involved with the Mona Foundation? Rainn Wilson: The founder of the Mona Foundation actually knew my dad for years, and the more I learned about it, the more I realized I really found the perfect charity. It sponsors schools and educational initiatives all over the planet. The thing that is really exciting is that it finds grass-roots educational initiatives that are already working, and the Mona Foundation comes in and says: ""What do you need? We want to help support you. We'll raise money, and we'll get you whatever you need. ... You need a science lab? You need a water fountain? You need a soccer field? You tell us what you need. We're not going to come in and tell you what we think you should be having next."" It's a really cool way of working, and I've gotten to visit some of those schools. It's a beautiful organization. Hamasaki: Why is this cause important to you? Wilson: I think that charity is a tricky thing, because a lot of times, people equate charity with handouts. I don't believe in handouts. I do believe in education. And I do believe that the way to change a society, to uplift people -- not just their spirit, but to uplift their society and economic base -- is through education. That's what Mona Foundation focuses on. It especially focuses on the education of women and girls. And I think that is key. ... With young women and girls, they're going to be ready to teach children; they're going to be ready to go back into their communities and share their knowledge with their children and with their communities. It's vital that women and girls across the world have access to really good education. Hamasaki: How did you get involved with Planting Peace? Wilson: Planting Peace is a charity I got to know via CNN Heroes. I was literally sitting in my trailer at ""The Office,"" and I was looking at the CNN website and it had CNN Heroes. And I saw this story on this guy, Aaron Jackson. I read about him there, and I Googled him and I did some more research, and I realized I stumbled upon a truly extraordinary human being. This is a young kid from Florida who grew up on a golf course. He went traveling in the Third World and he saw poverty, and he decided to devote his life to making the world a better place. Planting Peace works at this in a number of different ways. They support orphanages all over the world, but the other thing that Aaron works on with a network of people is deworming. Parasites really hold a society back. When kids have intestinal worms, they have less energy, they're not able to focus, they're not able to learn. (Jackson) has these pills he gets from the drug companies that are a penny and a half each, and it'll deworm a kid for six months. And he has been working so hard, tirelessly, to deworm the children of Haiti. He's handed out millions of these pills. Hamasaki: What's it like for you to see Planting Peace's efforts in Haiti? Wilson: I've gotten to visit Aaron several times down in Haiti. They have four or five orphanages in Haiti. I also went out when they distributed the deworming medication out in the rural villages and towns, and I got to meet a lot of people in their network. It was very heartwarming, it was very moving. They run an orphanage in Haiti for HIV-positive children; I think it's the only orphanage of its kind in Haiti. They're able to supply the meds that the kids need, they educate them, give them music classes. A lot of them are former street children, and they're turning them into vital members of Haitian society. It's extraordinary seeing that first-hand. Hamasaki: How did your experience with CNN Heroes evolve? Wilson: I think CNN Heroes is a great thing. I've been to the ceremony a couple of times, and I always follow it. It's incredible to see the amount of hard work and humility that these people have, uplifting the people around them. Their stories are always the same: They're a normal person, they're doing a normal job, they're no one special and they see a need. They're like, ""Gosh, there's street children here,"" or ""these sex workers are being used,"" or ""these veterans need a home,"" or ""this environment needs cleaning up,"" whatever it is. And they don't just complain about it. They actually just start to work very simply. And that's what we need. I think we need about 6 or 7 billion CNN Heroes, and we'll transform the world.","Rainn Wilson is involved with two charities: the Mona Foundation and Planting Peace .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN)  -- About 200 people have been arrested in a flare-up of anti-Christian violence in Gojra that left seven dead, a government minister said Monday. Christians in Karachi, Pakistan, on Monday protest the slayings of seven Christians in weekend violence. Rana Sana Ullah, Punjab's provincial law minister, told CNN that the paramilitary Rangers force was helping police and maintaining law and order. Seven people were killed and 20 injured Saturday when Muslim demonstrators set fire to houses in a Christian enclave and fighting broke out, authorities said. Police said the Muslims were protesting an alleged desecration of pages in the Quran, the Muslim sacred text, at a Christian wedding. At a news conference in Islamabad carried on local TV, Shehbaz Bhatti, federal minister for minorities, said an investigation determined there was no desecration of the Quran in village 95 Gill near Gojra City, and the allegations were baseless. He also said the government will rebuild all the burned houses. Bhatti told CNN that four women, two men and a child, all Christians, were either shot to death or killed when their houses were burned. About 50 houses were burned down, and more than 100 were looted by the protesters, Bhatti said. The incident occurred in Gojra City, about 160 kilometers (100 miles) southwest of Lahore. Kamran Michael, Punjab provincial minister for human rights and minority affairs, who is a Christian, told CNN after meeting with Pakistan's Christian leaders in Gojra that a consensus had been reached to observe three days of mourning, from Monday to Wednesday, for the attack on the Christians. On those three days, all schools, colleges, missions and educational institutions run by Christians will remain closed. Christian schools in Karachi, which were due to open for the new term Monday, remained closed. However, schools in most other areas of Pakistan are still on summer vacation. Michael also criticized Pakistan's ""law of offenses relating to religion,"" which has a penalty of life imprisonment for desecration of the Quran and even death for defiling the name of the prophet Mohammed. He called the law unjust and misused, and he strongly condemned it, demanding that it be amended because of its misuse against minorities. Journalist Nasir Habib contributed to this report.","7 killed, 20 hurt Saturday when Muslim protesters set fire to houses in Christian area .

"(CNN) -- I'm 45, and my son is 7. Once in a while, I still get carded when I try to buy certain well-guarded cold medicines, so I was taken aback in recent months when two different strangers asked, ""Is that your grandson?"" I was most surprised by the instant assumption, without an awkward pause or hesitation, as if grandmother was the only option. I was 38 when Jason was born -- not exactly a young mother, but nowhere near the age I imagine a grandmother to be. Both incidents took place after I moved from California to Atlanta, a Southern city, and both times I was asked by fellow black women -- one about 21, and one who was my senior. I thought about the incidents when I read a recent CNN.com essay by Rose Arce on being mistaken for her daughter's nanny. The essay inspired me to post my case of mistaken grandmother identity on Facebook, where I got lively responses ranging from ""Are you kidding?"" to makeover tips. Had I let too many gray hairs escape my patrol? Maybe the question shouldn't have surprised me, given the historically high teen birth rates and young grandmothers in the black community, especially in the South. But I have since learned about a convergence of birth and child-rearing trends that make it harder to guess whether an over-40 caretaker is a grandparent or, like me, a more ... er ... ""mature"" mother. First, experts say teenagers are having fewer babies. ""We believe evidence-based teen pregnancy programs work best,"" says Vikki Millender-Morrow, the CEO of the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention (G-CAPP), founded by Jane Fonda. ""We also believe in giving the kids hope. Even with all the education in the world, if they don't believe their future circumstances are brighter than what they're seeing, what's the reason to delay?"" Georgia had the highest teen birth rate in the nation in 1995, but currently ranks No. 13, according to Millender-Morrow. And recent data shows that Georgia was one of 10 states -- including Mississippi, Florida and Arizona -- that had the most dramatic decreases in births to 15- to 17-year-olds between 2007 and 2009. It's a national trend. According to preliminary data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics published this year, the birth rate for teens ages 15 to 19 had reached its lowest point in the nearly 70 years since the data has been tracked. Black births to teens ages 15 to 17 have plummeted since the 86.1 rate in 1991, for example, when the Hispanic rate was 69.2 (per 1,000 women). Still, black and Hispanic teenagers still have a much higher birth rate than non-Hispanic whites. The February report shows that the birth rate per 1,000 teens for black teenagers ages 15 to 17 was 32.1 in 2009, and even higher at 41 for Hispanic teens -- compared with just 11 for non-Hispanic whites. If more young people are weighing their life options -- with fewer ""babies having babies"" -- fewer grandparents are raising their grandchildren, right? Wrong. More children are being raised by their grandparents. U.S Census Bureau data from 2009, published in July, reports that the percentage of white and Hispanic children being raised by one or both grandparents doubled between 1991 and 2009, from about 1% to 2%. About 5% of black children are raised by a grandparent, a figure the Census Bureau says has remained constant since 1991. Citing the impact of harsh economic times, the Pew Research Center's latest data from 2008 indicates that 2.9 million children were being raised primarily by their grandparents -- up 8% from 2000, and 5% from 2007. Pew reports that the number of black grandparents serving as primary caregivers fell 12% between 2000 and 2008, but the number of white grandparents spiked 19%. The number of Hispanic grandparents becoming caregivers rose 14% during that eight-year period. According to Pew, 53% of grandparent caregivers are white, 24% are black, 18% are Hispanic and 3% are Asian. ""Many of these children come to live with their grandparents because of substance abuse or child maltreatment or abandonment,"" said Dr. Ottive Breedlove, associate director for operations at Project Healthy Grandparents, a community outreach research project that Georgia State University in Atlanta launched in 1995. ""You're entering your late fifties or sixties, and you're thinking about retiring, settling down, as opposed to gearing up again to raise a family."" The project gives grandparent caretakers in eligible counties services for a year, with referrals for financial assistance, housing and health care. An average of 60 to 75 grandparent-led families participate a year. And there is a waiting list. ""[The grandparents] don't get a rest,"" says child psychologist Dr. Judith M. Kinney, assistant director of the University of Maryland Counseling Center. She says that 25% to 30% of the patients in her private practice are being raised by one or both grandparents. ""They've been doing it for 40 years."" Fongie Lanier, 57, who lives outside Atlanta, took responsibility for raising her three grandchildren in 1997 because her daughter had substance abuse problems and was sometimes incarcerated. Lanier, a part-time assistant in a law office, says her daughter and grandchildren were living with her until her daughter left one day. ""It was too much responsibility for her,"" she says. Lanier says two of the three grandchildren also had medical challenges because of a rare blood disorder. Now, her grandchildren are 23, 21 and 19, with the youngest about to start college. ""Some of my friends have young kids, and I have grandkids,"" says Lanier, who got married and had her first child at 16. Most of my friends, like me, got a much later start. And we're not alone. The National Center for Health Statistics reports that the birth rate for women ages 40 to 44 rose 3% between 2008 and 2009 -- the only age group to have an increase for that time period. Women are waiting longer to have children. According to a 2009 report from the center, the average age of a mother's first birth jumped 3.6 years between 1970 and 2006, from 21.4 years to 25 years. For black mothers, the average age rose from 21.7 to 22.7; for Latina mothers, the average age for a first child rose from 22.4 to 23.1. No wonder observers are confused. South Carolina stay-at-home mother LaVeda H. Mason, a writer, experienced age whiplash after her seventh child was born when she was 40. Until then, a youthful face meant she was carded constantly. No more. Two weeks after the first time she wasn't carded, the bigger shock came in a restaurant: ""The woman behind me looked at me and said, 'What a cute baby! Is she your grandbaby?' I was speechless for 30 seconds until I realized my mouth was hanging open. Then I just closed it and said, 'No, she's my daughter.' ... My mother said, 'Girls are having babies at 15, so if you have a baby at 15, and your child has a baby at 15 or 16, at 30 you're a grandmother.' I like to think I'm not old enough to be a grandmother, but since my oldest is 21, it is possible."" My over-40-new-mom status might have come as a surprise to observers previously, but regional customs might explain why no one had blurted out the grandmother question before I moved to Atlanta. Until recently, I lived in Los Angeles. ""Southern black people, to me, treat other black people like family,"" says Duchess Harris, 42, author of ""Black Feminist Politics from Kennedy to Obama."" Harris and her husband had the last of their three children when she was 37. She's an associate professor of American Studies at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota, but she was born in Virginia. Maybe as more mothers wait longer to have children, the question ""Are you his grandmother?"" eventually will be weighed as carefully as ""Are you pregnant?"" You can't tell in a glance.

"(CNN) -- Sudanese billionaire and communications mogul Mo Ibrahim has issued a warning to African leaders clinging to power, saying people are no longer prepared to put up with bad governance on the continent. Ibrahim says the face of Africa has changed and the Arab Spring has shown the world that the younger generation are not afraid to demand change. ""There's a lot of African people who are educated and well informed and that's a better generation than ours and those people wont take nonsense,"" he said. ""These are the people that went out in Tahrir Square, Tunis and Libya and bred havoc,"" he added. The businessman's remarks come as his foundation awards its annual prize for good governance and leadership in Africa. It has been two years since the Mo Ibrahim Foundation has awarded the accolade, which goes to candidates based on their ""exercise of leadership and the performance of their country during their time in office,"" according to the Mo Ibrahim Foundation website. The committee, made up of former leaders and Nobel Prize winners, said that there had been no worthy candidates in the previous two years. ""They have a strict criteria, this is not a pension, this is a prize for excellence in leadership, it's not easy,"" said Ibrahim. Former Cape Verde President, Pedro Verona Pires, who stepped down in August after 10 years in power, was recognized this year. The group said that the leader had turned the cluster of islands off the West African coast into ""a model of democracy, stability and increased prosperity."" The chair of the prize committee, Salim Ahmed Salim, said. ""Under his 10 years as president, the nation became only the second African country to graduate from the United Nation's Least Developed category and has won international recognition for its record on human rights and good governance."" The Ibrahim Prize for Achievement in African Leadership is one of the world's most valuable individual prizes. Ibrahim made a fortune in the cell phone industry, established the foundation bearing his name in 2006. Previous winners include Mozambique's former President, Joaquim Chissano and Botswana's President, Festus Mogae. The $5 million award is paid over 10 years and $200,000 annually for life thereafter. The Foundation will also consider funding good causes supported by the laureate. Ibrahim says the prize is needed as leaders in African countries can sometimes be tempted to hang on to power for monetary reasons. He says he had to start the foundation because leaders were not doing the job they were supposed to do. President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo of Equatorial Guinea and Angola's President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos are two of the longest running leaders in Africa. Both have been head of their respective countries for 32 years. While Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe has been in power for 31 years since 1980. The foundation uses an 84-criteria index to grade governance in Africa. The top-governed African nations, according to the index, are Mauritius, Cape Verde, Seychelles, Botswana and South Africa. But while there may not have been an award in the previous two years, Ibrahim predicts the foundation will be giving out more money in the future. ""I think the quality of leaders coming to Africa now are really improving a lot and what is important in Africa is the rise in civil society,"" he said. ""The pressure from civil society, I'm sure is going to bring forward and produce more and more wonderful leaders for our future,"" he continued. The hope of the foundation is to help the continent move towards greater democracy and peaceful transitions of power. However, Ibrahim believes that the game is up for leaders who cling to power for 30 to 40-years. His cites Libya's former leader for 41-years, Moammar Gaddafi, as an example. ""The message is clear to all this kind of generation of leadership: gentlemen time is up,"" he said. ""Please retire, otherwise Tahrir square is coming to your country.""","Sudanese mogul Mo Ibrahim warns long-running leaders that continent has changed .

"Washington (CNN) -- The insistence that former Sen. John Edwards serve some jail time over allegations he broke campaign finance laws caused a collapse in plea negotiations between lawyers for the former presidential candidate and the Justice Department last week. Edwards wanted to have as ""minimal"" impact on his two younger kids as possible, a source with knowledge of the talks confirmed to CNN Sunday. Edwards has a 10-year-old son and a 12-year-old daughter. The Raleigh News and Observer, which first reported the story, said the Justice Department was insisting that Edwards serve six months in jail if he pleaded guilty. After initially saying Edwards had to agree to plead guilty to a felony in earlier discussions, CNN is told prosecutors last week offered for him instead to plead guilty to some misdemeanors. But the jail time was the breaking point. ""He did not want to have an extended period of time away from his kids,"" said the source, who would not speak on the record because the details of the plea discussions have not been made public. After the breakdown in negotiations, a grand jury indicted Edwards, a former Democratic vice presidential nominee, on six felony counts. In court on Friday, Edwards pleaded not guilty. ""I will regret for the rest of my life the pain and the harm that I've caused to others. But I did not break the law. And I never, ever thought I was breaking the law,"" he told reporters outside the federal courthouse in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. The News and Observer also reported that Edwards' lawyers were not confident they would be allowed to urge a judge to consider alternatives for incarceration such as a halfway house, weekend passes or home arrest in order to give him more time with his children. After the death of his wife, Elizabeth, Edwards is the primary caregiver for the two younger children.","John Edwards insisted on ""minimal"" impact on his youngest kids, source says .

"(CNN) -- As 2010 draws to a close, we who report on the ever-evolving digital space have been given the perfect backdrop for looking back at the year that was and the year ahead. In a year full of gray -- think of the debate over whether Facebook and WikiLeaks are forces for good or evil -- two high-profile attempts to make things black and white bubbled to the surface in the past few weeks: the federal government's rules on access to internet service and its proposed ""do not track"" registry for online advertising. Both represent a significant shift in thinking about the internet, even if the results for the average American aren't immediately obvious. For starters, an internet version of the ""do not call list"" for telemarketers would seem to destroy the holy grail that online publishers and advertisers have sought since the early days of the Web: advertising directly targeted to individual consumers' behavior. Although marketers have long used cookies to track your Web surfing, recent innovations have given them a whole new level of precision. Facebook's ""like"" button -- derided this year as a major privacy infraction because it exposes you and your preferences not just to friends but to advertisers -- has been installed on more than 2 million Web sites, with tens of thousands more adding it daily. Geolocation services like Foursquare, in their infancy a year ago, now track the whereabouts of millions of users. With smartphones growing ubiquitous and location-aware applications of all kinds becoming commonplace, advertising that knows both where you are and what you like is very much a reality. Most advertisers and publishers do allow users to opt out of such targeting, but the Federal Trade Commission believes that simpler, more transparent options are needed. The devil is in the details here: Opt-outs on obscure Web pages or hidden browser menus won't help consumers much, but in-your-face requirements that encourage more users to take their privacy more seriously may pose a huge problem to some of the Web's most promising companies. Information and how it travels are also central to ""net neutrality,"" the buzzword for unrestricted access to internet services and content. Rules passed this month by the Federal Communications Commission probably won't much alter the way you use the internet, but they pose interesting questions. For starters, as an internet regulator, would the FCC have the authority -- through its new relationship with internet service providers -- to block a site like WikiLeaks, which posts information potentially harmful to government interests? Thus far, we've seen the private sector self-regulate by cutting off services to WikiLeaks, but the new FCC-ISP dynamic could create intriguing (frightening?) scenarios down the road as WikiLeaks intensifies its document dumps, which seems likely. Other internet issues that seized our attention in 2010 are at least tangentially related to this debate. A largely unregulated internet has created knowledge and wealth, but it's also long provided a medium for predatory, abusive and bullying behavior. Concern over this came to a head this year, with social networking services taking heat for their role in cyberbullying. Perhaps the most prominent example of internet harassment came in September, when Rutgers University student Tyler Clementi committed suicide after a video stream set up without his knowledge showed his sexual encounter with a man in his dorm room. Although prosecution of cyberbullies falls out of the FCC's jurisdiction, provisions in the net neutrality rules, such as the ability for businesses that provide internet access (like coffee shops and bookstores) to block content as they see fit, have the potential to cut off a readily available source of the anonymity that bullying thrives on. Of course, blocking access to the likes of Facebook and Twitter has negative repercussions too, especially as more consumers turn to these services both for communication and to share news and information. But like much of what went on in 2010, that's still a gray area, too. The reality of the year ahead probably falls somewhere between doomsday scenarios and an internet that continues to evolve for both consumers and big business. Information is coming of age, and the stage has now been set for some interesting all-but-inevitable conflicts that will probably be right there on the surface when we take a look again, roughly 365 days from now. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Adam Ostrow.","Adam Ostrow says 2010 brought gray areas such as WikiLeaks and privacy issues .

"Idaho Falls, Idaho (CNN) -- Forget, for the moment, about computer whiz kids who download copyrighted music for free. Forget, too, about sophisticated hackers who can steal identities. Focus instead on the next wave of potential computer miscreants -- criminals who can penetrate corporate computer systems to turn valves, start pumps or surge power at factories or electrical plants. They might even be able to hit chemical facilities. Those folks are on the minds of the researchers at the Idaho National Laboratory, where the federal government regularly trains industry leaders on how to protect critical infrastructure from cyberattacks. In the not-so-distant past, instructors here say, security officials relied on the ""3 Gs"" -- guns, gates and guards -- to protect infrastructure from intrusions. But increasingly mechanical systems inside those gates are being linked to computers and controlled via networks and cyberspace. That has left industrial control systems vulnerable to attack. CNN: Hackers take aim at real-world targets . To demonstrate the vulnerability, the Department of Homeland Security and Idaho National Laboratory in Idaho Falls recently showed reporters a cyberattack on a mock-up of a chemical facility. In the exercise, a small group of ""Red Team"" attackers staged an assault on the chemical plant. A larger group of ""Blue Team"" defenders sought to protect that mock-up building, which was constructed of barrel-size containers of water connected by pipes and pumps such as those found in chemical plants. The exercise used concepts that are relevant in the real world. Among them: . Exploiting corporate trust . The Red Team attackers, looking for access to the computer network, don't look for direct access to the control systems they covet. They know the vulnerability is elsewhere -- most likely in the executive offices of the fictitious chemical company. Executives frequently have access to internal computers networks, so they'll have timely access to information about productivity, output and information important to the market. They also frequently have access, perhaps indirectly, to networks that link to control systems. Assailants know they can ""exploit the trust relationship."" Getting a toehold into a system . In the Idaho exercise, Red Team members get a toehold by phishing, a tactic also used by hackers to steal financial or other information. They send an e-mail that appears to be from a friend or a legitimate organization to a representative, which contains malicious software and which opens a link between the sender's computer and the corporate computer. Subverting a system's security . Having established a toehold on the chemical company's computer, the Red Team discovers a surveillance camera in the chemical plant's control room. The camera, intended to safeguard the chemical plant, can now be turned against it. The Red Team can use the camera to observe the plant's staffing levels or zoom in on control panels and mechanical devices, gathering information that will help them in their attack. And once the attack is launched, they can each watch their opponent's response. The 'man in the middle' In sophisticated attacks, the Red Team can even insert itself between the machine and the machine's operator. The team can control the amount of water through a pump, while indicating to the machine's operator that everything remains normal. Red Team-Blue Team exercises typically last between eight to 12 hours, and are followed by a ""hot wash"" in which a ""White Team"" analyzes the attack and reviews ways to prevent attacks and respond to them. Fears of online intrusions on industrial control systems are not theoretical. In a then-classified 2007 demonstration at Idaho, experimenters using computer inputs altered a large electric power generator, causing it to self-destruct. The experiment, known as ""Aurora,"" was the first demonstration that attackers could not only turn a mechanical device on or off but could destroy it. Then in 2010, a computer worm known as Stuxnet was discovered after it spread indiscriminately but is believed to have targeted equipment used by Iran to enrich uranium. The source of the worm has not been identified. Department of Homeland Security officials say attacks on industrial systems are occurring. Attackers are ""kicking on the doors"" of industrial systems, said Greg Schaffer, acting deputy under secretary of the department's National Protection and Programs Directorate.","Officials in Idaho train for cyberattacks that could affect the real world .

"(CNN) -- When does a cult become a religion? When the cult leader dies. Only then do L. Ron Hubbard's Dianetics practitioners become the religion of Scientology, the followers of Joseph Smith become full-fledged Mormons, or -- by the same logic -- a few anti-establishment apostles become Christianity. What then of the cult of Apple after the death of its own leader, Steve Jobs? I like Apple products as much as any user, and respect the contributions that Apple under Jobs' leadership made to the co-evolution of human beings and their technologies. But all along I have also been aware of the closed nature of Apple technologies, as well as the leap of faith that has been required to accept Jobs' promise that doing things in some new way will be ""fantastic."" Without Jobs telling us to cross the chasm, will we continue to embrace each of Apple's future revolutions in hardware, software or both? For most of us, particularly those of us who want to know as little as possible about technology in order to use it, Apple has been a perfect answer. As members of the first generation of a digital society -- digital immigrants, if you will -- we could not relate to computers and software directly. Steve Jobs found and employed interfaces that quite literally translated the directories and sub-directories of computers to the files and folders of a desktop. He promoted real world metaphors for otherwise obscure processes, making the immense power of computers accessible to many of us much sooner and more completely than we would have achieved without him. And moving on from there, he and his teams liberated digital music files with iTunes and the iPod, and popularized the smartphone with the iPhone. At each step, however, we consumers and users had to make certain compromises. Some of them we know about, and others most of us are much less aware of, at least right now. Back when Jobs returned to Apple and came out with the iMac, many users were aghast at being asked to purchase a computer with no floppy drive! Sure, Steve saw the writing on the wall (or felt confident enough to scribble it up there himself), and decided for us that floppy drives were obsolete. If you can burn CDs, why mess with floppies? Besides, Internet speeds were starting to increase and it was just a matter of time before people exchanged files by e-mail instead of handing and mailing physical disks to one another. But to take this leap required a bit of faith from consumers. It was a level of faith that I suspect only a leader as charismatic as Jobs could elicit from us. Time after time, Jobs told us to trust him, and time after time we did. No serial port? No firewire? No Flash? No keyboard? Just trust Steve, he has a vision for how this is all going to work out. Meanwhile, all along the way, we were also being asked to surrender a certain degree of authority over our own devices. Part of the reason Apple products work so well is that they are closed to our intervention. Unlike Microsoft PC's, early Apple products only worked with Apple-made peripherals. That's why Apple machines never (or very rarely) had conflicts or crashes. They weren't trying to accommodate everybody else's printers and modems and drivers. Likewise, Apple iPhones are closed systems. Unless we ""jailbreak"" our phones, software and content must be purchased from Apple. The iPhone's capabilities are similarly limited to activities that Apple deems appropriate and profitable for itself and its partners. As beginning users, which most of us are, these are compromises we don't really care too much about. Who wanted to do something with his phone that Jobs said was unnecessary, anyway? But as we get increasingly comfortable with computers and networking, we may start to want to have more of a say in the way we use our devices and for what purposes. Just like AOL subscribers who finally decided they could leave the wading pool and swim out to the real Internet, Apple users might eventually trust themselves to make their own decisions about what constitutes the appropriate use of a computer or smartphone. At the very least, our willingness to trust Jobs may be compromised by the fact that he is gone. Without him telling us to take a counterintuitive leap with him into the future equivalent of iTunes, tablets or gesture-based displays, will we go? Until now, the strangeness, learning curve and doubt have been assuaged by the voice of Jobs himself. From here on, we'll have to believe that this is what Jobs would have meant for us. The struggle to divine the will of Jobs has already begun. Plans for a future Apple TV are already rumored to be a secret Jobs project. And the next few iterations of the Mac and iPhone operating systems, as well as whatever will one day replace them, will no doubt be credited to plans and conversations with Jobs before his death. The bigger an adjustment any new Apple technology requires of us, the more heavily it will be touted as the will of Jobs. Once the last secret plans penned by Jobs himself are revealed, it will be up to his innermost circle to claim they now speak for Jobs, that they really do know what it is he meant and meant for us. Some will argue that he meant for Apple to become a content delivery system that secured the financial interests of creators. Others will claim he meant for technology to be free. Still others will see Jobs guiding Apple technologies from production to consumption in order to stave off the content glut and create a market for professionals. Meanwhile, those who lose internal Apple battles will spin off their own companies, convinced they are the true lineage of Jobs. Yes, very big corporations have survived after the departure of their founding visionaries. As many have argued, Disney managed to do pretty well after the departure of Walt. But Disney is a content company. Like the founders of the most successful religions, Walt Disney left behind a mythology that stood in his place: Mickey, Snow White, Dumbo, Tomorrowland. Disney is embodied by this bible of stories. Operating systems and technologies are not content, and they don't live on in the same way as foundational myths. One device or system is simply replaced by another, which creates discontinuity, fear and confusion. Great technology ideas require us to change the way we actually do things. Without Jobs to confirm the insane greatness of such changes, it will be up to us to judge whether a given innovation really is in the spirit of Jobs. And I'm not sure Apple can afford for us to stop and think before rushing to line up outside the Apple store for the next sacrament. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Douglas Rushkoff.","Douglas Rushkoff: Now that Steve Jobs is dead, will cult of Apple endure?

"(CNN) -- Thousands of women demonstrated Monday in front of Yemen's foreign ministry in the capital, Sanaa, demanding U.N. intervention in the ongoing unrest in the Persian Gulf nation, residents and eyewitnesses said. The protest comes a day after the first woman was killed in a demonstration against the government, according to opposition activists. The women called for sanctions against President Ali Abdullah Saleh and asked that he be tried by the International Criminal Court. They also alleged that snipers were on the rooftop of the foreign ministry Sunday. The protests came hours after gunfire and loud explosions reverberated throughout the capital early Monday. Medics in Change Square said at least four people were killed and another 26 injured after government forces raided parts of the capital. Another eight people died and 20 were injured in government raids on civilian property, said Abdulqawi al-Qaisi, a prominent opposition leader and head of the Sadeq Ahmar media office. ""The death toll is expected to rise as a number of the injured are in critical condition,"" he said. According to eyewitnesses, government security forces clashed with tribesmen loyal to Hashid tribal leader Sadeq Al-Ahmar in the Hasabah neighborhood in northern Sanaa. Government forces attacked the tribal leader's family residences, al-Qaisi said. ""The government attacks against innocent civilians and the Ahmar family continued for hours and hundreds of explosions were heard throughout the morning, causing fear throughout the capital,"" he said. Residents and witnesses also reported that the Republican Guard was bombarding the headquarters of the 1st Armored Division, loyal to Maj. Gen. Ali Mohsen Al-Ahmar, who withdrew his support for Saleh in March. The embattled Saleh said Sunday that ""strong documentation of the cooperation"" between al Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood indicate a military coup that is destabilizing the country. He described the opposition as ""insane people, who can't sleep and only want to take power."" ""The international community must stop Saleh from killing his own people,"" al-Qaisi said Monday. ""If no intervention takes place, he will continue killing and the casualties will rise."" On Sunday night, three people died in Sanaa when a rocket-propelled grenade hit bystanders, medics said. Earlier Sunday, Yemeni security forces opened fired on demonstrators gathering for a planned march in the capital, killing five people and injuring 54 others, according to a medic on the scene. In a separate demonstration in the city of Taiz, a government sniper killed a woman with a shot to the head, medics and eyewitnesses said. Medics identified the woman as Aziza Othman Kaleb. Snipers also injured four others who were next to the woman in the march, the sources said. Opposition activists said the slain woman was 20 and said she was the first female to be killed while marching against the government. CNN could not independently confirm that claim. Activist Atiaf Alwazir called the shooting of a woman ""a sign that the government security forces will not really stop shooting, even if there are women."" ""Women may have been beaten, arrested at times -- but never directly shot at and this is a scary escalation,"" she said. The crackdown in Sanaa was also bloody, doctors said. ""The injured are entering the hospital by the minute. We need help. We call on people to donate blood for the injured,"" said Mohammed Al-Qubati, who works at a field hospital in Change Square. Five of the wounded are in critical condition, he said from the square that has become the center of protests against Saleh. Protesters carried signs with slogans including: ""Saleh kills and the world watches. Is this the justice the West preaches?"" according to witnesses and activists. Others carried flowers or signs that said: ""We are not armed, Don't attack us with gunfire,"" witnesses said Sunday. CNN has not independently confirmed the details of casualties in Sanaa or Taiz, and the government has not yet responded to requests for comment. Saleh, meeting Sunday with Yemeni leaders, said members of the U.N. Security Council don't understand the true picture in his country, the state news agency Saba reported. He also said those who participate in ""heavily armed marches"" are killing soldiers. ""Are these peaceful acts?"" he asked, according to the news agency. Last week, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in Sanaa, marching, chanting and calling for the United Nations to come out with a firm resolution in support for change in the country. For its part, the government said it is trying to come up with a solution to end the political stalemate. ""The ruling party is serious on finding a solution to the political crisis from its roots to ensure they don't erupt in the future,"" said Tareq Shami, spokesman for the General People's Congress, the ruling party. CNN senior State Department producer Elise Labott contributed to this report.","NEW: At least 12 people are dead in Yemen, officials say .

"(CNN) -- Europe's financial crisis claimed its second scalp in three days when Italy's Silvio Berlusconi announced he will step down after parliament approves new austerity measures in an effort to stave off economic collapse. The scandal-plagued prime minister will follow his Greek counterpart George Papandreou into early retirement as fears grow that Italy, the eurozone's third largest economy, may default on its debt. Italy has failed to implement austerity measures designed to reduce its mammoth â‚¬1.9 trillion debt load -- nearly six times that of Greece -- and the cost to the country of borrowing more money to pay off that debt is spiraling out of control. While no one knows yet whether Italy will default, analysts say that the country is vastly too big to bail out -- and that the consequences for the world economy of a default would be a disaster. What happens next? Much like Greek premier Papandreou, Berlusconi said he will not resign until the government passes harsh austerity measures recommended by eurozone leaders aimed at trimming Italy's debt. The next step is for the Italian parliament to consider and vote on the measures -- which include tax rises and an increase in the retirement age -- within the next several weeks. After the parliamentary votes Berlusconi will tender his resignation to President Giorgio Napolitano, who will then begin consultations with lawmakers to decide whether to form a government or call for elections. Berlusconi and members of the Northern League party want elections as soon as possible, but other lawmakers and European leaders would like to see an interim government composed of non-partisan technocrats that could quickly implement austerity measures in order to reassure global markets and restore confidence in the country. Business figures tapped to lead a potential technocratic interim government include Luca Cordero di Montezemolo, chairman of Ferrari, and Alessandro Profumo, former CEO of Italy's largest bank UniCredit. Political options that have been floated include Angelino Alfano, known to be Berlusconi's hand-picked successor, Gianni Letta, Berlusconi's chief of staff, or Mario Monti, a former commissioner with the European Union. No one is a fan of uncertainty, and no one is going to invest in a debt-ridden country without a plan for recovery -- much less one without a functioning government -- so Italy's short-term plan will be to get these austerity measures passed, see Berlusconi off, and hold new elections so at least international lenders will know who they're dealing with. Check out CNN's interactive map of European debt at a glance . What's wrong with Italy? The basic problem is that it's becoming prohibitively expensive for Italy to borrow money to finance its debt -- a problem rooted in investor confidence in the debt-laden country. With a defunct government and a shrinking economy, Italy is finding it increasingly difficult to find people willing to lend it money in order to reduce its mammoth â‚¬1.9 trillion debt load, which is nearly six times that of Greece. The less confidence there is in a country, the higher the bond yields, or rate, that country will have to pay in order to secure more money. Right now confidence in Italy is at a euro-era low, which means Italy is paying more than ever to finance its debt. Business 360 blog on Italy: Too big to fail, too big to bail . What is a bond yield? A bond yield is basically another term for the rate Italy has to pay to lenders who buy its government bonds. The 10-year government bond is the standard bond used to measure the relative interest rates from country to country. A government raises money to pay its bills by selling these bonds -- so the higher the yield or rate, the more it costs Italy to borrow money in order to pay its debts. Italy's 10-year bond yield hit a staggering record high of 7.3% on Wednesday morning; by contrast, the bond yield for Germany -- a relatively healthy economy -- closed at 1.8% on Tuesday night. Italy will already have to borrow at least â‚¬300 billion -- nearly the total Greece owes to lenders -- next year alone to pay off maturing debts, and the worry is that the skyrocketing interest rates on Italian bonds may soon make it too expensive for the country to continue borrowing money. Why are Italy's bond yields so high? Bond yields are driven by confidence and based on supply and demand. The more confident investors are in the health of the Italian economy, the more government bonds, or sovereign debt, the investors will buy. The more bonds that are being bought, the lower the rates will be on the bonds -- meaning Italy can borrow money to pay its bills at relatively cheap rates. When confidence in an economy drops, however, fewer investors are willing to invest money in that country's bonds, which is precisely what has happened in Italy. Italy's bonds are unattractive to investors because there are fears about the country's ability to pay off long-term debt based on current economic projections. Why is a 7% yield considered the point of no return? Greece, Ireland and Portugal were all forced to seek bailouts once their bond yields surpassed and remained above the 7% mark for an extended period of time. While there is nothing about the 7% figure that automatically triggers a bailout -- something that would be impossible in Italy's case anyway, as Europe simply cannot afford to bail out the country -- experts do see the rate as difficult to overcome. Greece, Ireland and Portugal all needed bailouts within two months of their bond yields breaching and then remaining above 7%. The recent high yields are particularly concerning because the European Central Bank has been buying Italian bonds since the start of August in an effort to create a sort of false demand, which would then drive the rate down to a manageable level. That has not worked, but it could be a lot worse had the ECB not taken the action at all. How can Italy get out of this mess? Italy will default on its debt if it doesn't figure out a way to get its bond yields down to a manageable level. The yields won't budge until Italian lawmakers take concrete steps to reassure international lenders that the country is a safe bet. ""Italy will not be out of the heat of bond markets until a solid and stable government actually implements austerity and undertakes reforms with strong credible leadership,"" said Jan Randolph, head of sovereign risk at IHS Global Insight. Even if they pass these the austerity proposals, some economists fear Italy will still drown in debt if it doesn't develop more drastic measures. The ECB should also increase its purchasing of Italian bonds in order to make it cheaper for Italy to raise money, according to Barry Eichengreen, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. ""Unless yields on those bonds fall to German levels, there is no way that Italy's debt arithmetic can be made to add up,"" he wrote. How would an Italian default affect the world? A default by Italy, the world's eight-largest economy with the world's fourth-largest stock of outstanding government bonds, could have a disastrous effect on many European banks and global markets, experts say. European banks, particularly those in Germany and France, are the largest holders of Italian debt and would be hit the hardest by a default. A default would also wreak havoc on already-shaky global markets and could dash any hopes of economic growth in Europe for the foreseeable future. As concerns continue to grow around Italy, the head of the International Monetary Fund painted a stark picture of the challenges facing the world's economic stability. ""The global economy has entered a dangerous and uncertain phase,"" Christine Lagarde said in remarks prepared for a speech at the International Finance Forum in Beijing. ""If we do not act, and act together, we could enter a downward spiral of uncertainty, financial instability and a collapse in global demand."" ""Ultimately, we could face a lost decade of low growth and high unemployment,"" she said. CNN's Joshua Levs, Hada Messia and Nina dos Santos contributed to this report.","Italy's bond yields have passed the dangerous 7% threshold .

"San Francisco (CNN) -- Intel, which dominates the PC market but has struggled to break into smartphones, is getting a hand from Google. Upcoming versions of Android, the No. 1 smartphone operating system from Google, will be compatible with Intel processors, the companies announced at Intel's developer conference on Tuesday. ""We want to make Intel architecture the platform of choice for smartphones,"" Intel CEO Paul Otellini said onstage. ""Every time we have collaborated with Google, good things have come out of it."" The partnership will aid Intel in delivering on its promise to finally release smartphones with its technologies by the middle of 2012. Google may benefit from accommodating a company that has significant influence in computers, which is the market Google is struggling to break into with its Chromebook project. The two companies already collaborate on that laptop operating system. ""The partnership has been great,"" said Andy Rubin, Google's executive for mobile development, who took the stage at Intel's conference to announce the deal. In his keynote, Otellini touted Intel's Ultrabook concept, which the company has been reportedly nudging partners to embrace. The laptop concept facilitates very thin, light and affordable computers with batteries that can last for about a full day on a single charge. They look similar to Apple's MacBook Air, which uses Intel's Core processor. Otellini also discussed a new processor, slated for 2013, called Haswell. Devices with the chip can remain connected to the Internet in standby mode for 10 days before the battery depletes, he said. Haswell will be tailored to Ultrabooks and tablets running Windows 8, the new operating system Microsoft was showing at the same time at its own conference in Anaheim, California. ""Computing means a lot more than just computers,"" Otellini said. ""Just as computing has evolved, so too has Intel's architecture."" Intel's recent focus on reducing energy consumption, thereby improving battery life, should bolster its efforts in smartphones, analysts say. The company is also working on more compact chips, which it is calling ""3-D transistors"" because of the unique way the microscopic parts are situated. Google and Intel did not say which chip will power upcoming Android phones or which manufacturers have agreed to make devices for it. Most smartphones and tablets use chips designed by ARM Holdings, which are popular for their efficiency. The next version of Android for phones and tablets, called Ice-Cream Sandwich, will debut next month or in November, Google has said.","Google will make future versions of Android for Intel chips .

"(CNN) -- It's been a big tourism year for the Big Apple. New York expects to draw more than 50 million visitors by the end of 2011 -- a record for the city, Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced Tuesday. ""While playing host to the world isn't new for us, the number of visitors we're welcoming in recent years is new,"" Bloomberg said during a ceremony in Times Square, while surrounded by cheering tourism officials. ""That means more guests in our hotels, more shoppers in our stores, larger audiences in our museums and theaters, more diners at our restaurants."" The city reached the milestone a year ahead of schedule, Bloomberg said. Throughout 2011, New York was the No. 1 city and overseas destination in the United States, his office added. To celebrate, the mayor named newlyweds Craig and Lucy Johnson from Lichfield, England, as the honorary 50 millionth visitors to New York and presented them with a ""golden ticket"" to the city. The couple will receive thousands of dollars' worth of gift cards from New York retailers and tickets to a Broadway show. The Johnsons were among the 10.1 million international visitors to come to the city this year. Another 40.1 million tourists came from within U.S. borders. Tourism is a huge moneymaker for the city, generating $32 billion in visitor spending and $48 billion in economic impact, Bloomberg's office said. ""New York City's quality of life has contributed to this great success, and we are confident we will sustain the success of our tourism industry in the months and years ahead,"" Bloomberg said.","New York expects to draw more than 50 million visitors by the end of 2011, mayor says .

"New York (CNN) -- In Manhattan's protest hub, the big decisions are made by consensus. Each day in the privately owned Zuccotti Park, where Wall Street protesters have encamped for more than a month, demonstrators engage in a slow, seemingly cumbersome process of making their voices heard. The group, which calls itself Occupy Wall Street, arranges in a half-circle inside the city's financial district for what demonstrators say is their General Assembly, listening to the concerns of those who decide to participate before voting on issues thought to affect them all. Police prevent the use of loudspeakers. So the group, undeterred, instead echoes the voice of whomever is speaking, rendering their comments much more audible to the hundreds that gather each day. And their topics range: From the practical (such as where to march and when) to the mundane (like concerns about trash collection), nothing reaches a conclusion until almost the entire group agrees. Wall Street demonstrations start second month . The meetings, meanwhile, have cropped up in other cities, while similar demonstrations have taken hold in dozens of cities nationwide and around the world. The protesters in Zuccotti Park commonly say it's democracy in action, and it works. ""The idea of a General Assembly -- a place where people can air their grievances against the government -- that does not happen anymore in America,"" said Lorenzo Serna, a protester and camp volunteer. ""We have created that space here, so I already think we are a success."" But the process can be messy. At a recent General Assembly meeting in New York, a demonstrator -- unhappy with the agreed-to rules banning drugs and alcohol -- decided he would be disruptive, even announcing his intention to the group. The group, however, permitted his comments, apparently not wanting to alienate anyone. Earlier this month, Rep. John Lewis, D-Georgia, showed up at an Occupy Wall Street demonstration in Atlanta and asked if he could address the crowd. The distinguished civil rights leader wanted to speak to the people in his district, and at first, it looked like he had the support of the group. But then, one man, while acknowledging Lewis' contributions to society, said the Occupy Wall Street movement is a Democratic process, ""in which no singular human being is inherently more valuable than any other human being."" That led to a 10-minute group discussion before it was decided by consensus that Lewis should not be allowed to speak. Blog: 'Occupy' movement goes global . Consensus-building through a group process clearly has its shortcomings. But some experts on the democratic process see it as an effective means to an end. ""Setting an effective group process, we think, is really the only way to move things forward,"" said Maya Lampson, director of the Leadership New York program at the Coro New York Leadership Center. Coro is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that trains people to be effective, ethical leaders in a Democratic system. ""Having a consensus decision-making process allows for inclusivity and also more of a sense of buy-in and ownership,"" Lampson said, ""so when decisions do get made, things can move forward a little more rapidly."" She has high hopes that the Occupy Wall Street movement will effect change in some way. Marty Linsky does not. ""Because they are committed to this process, what they agree on is becoming more and more abstract,"" the co-founder of Cambridge Leadership Associates said. His company is often called to help organizations turn a bunch of good ideas and recommendations into action with a positive outcome. He doesn't see that happening with Occupy Wall Street. ""I think that's the danger of this kind of process,"" Linsky said. ""If we say we're going to operate by consensus, which is everybody has to agree, well, the only way you can get everybody to agree when people have different agendas is to agree on something that is so ethereal as to be meaningless."" Linsky warns that this addiction to a process in which everybody has a voice could spell the demise for Occupy Wall Street. His advice to people taking part in the demonstrations is to run for office, work for a campaign and learn from the tea party. ""Tea party folks understood that if they were actually going to create change as opposed to just complain ... they had to figure out a way to influence directly the decisions that people made."" One thing Linsky thinks the Occupy Wall Street movement has working in its favor is that it's constantly growing. ""These folks -- like the tea party people -- have numbers,"" he said, ""and numbers in a Democratic setting are an incredibly important resource and a powerful counterweight to dollars."" In order for that to be an effective tool in achieving whatever it is the Occupy Wall Street movement eventually decides to do, Linsky said someone is going to have to assume leadership. ""If someone were to actually try to shape and form that movement into something that actually might effect change, that person is going to annoy a lot of those people in Zuccotti Park."" Linsky said anyone in a leadership role within the movement will automatically make enemies because he or she will have to put some people's agendas on hold. The leadership role is starting to be filled, not by one person but two dozen people. They call themselves the Demands Committee. They're meeting regularly in New York to discuss possible actionable demands: a list they can present to the entire movement. This being a group process, they say the eventual list will be adopted only if it is approved by more than two-thirds of the Occupy Wall Street demonstrators.","Occupy Wall Street has lasted more than a month .

"London (CNN) -- The looting of a large collection of priceless coins, statues and jewelry from a bank vault during Libya's recent civil war has highlighted the risk of looting during times of conflict. Interpol is hunting for the hoard of Roman and Hellenistic objects -- dubbed the ""Benghazi Treasure"" --stolen from the city's Commercial Bank in May 2011. But the theft is not an isolated incident. According to UNESCO's Assistant Director-General for Culture Francesco Bandarin, the looting of antiquities and archaeological sites occurs regularly during times of conflict and even during peacetime. It is a problem that the UN agency is constantly battling. ""In the present moment it is difficult for us to do much because the situation is still very precarious, there is no administration in place in [Libya], there are difficulties in communicating,"" said Bandarin. Bandarin's main fear is that the ""Benghazi Treasure"" will be dispersed or, worse, in the case of the coins, melted down and sold. The thieves reportedly drilled through the concrete ceiling of the bank vault to reach the coins and took only the most valuable items. ""It looks targeted and well-planned, they knew what they were doing,"" said Dr. Hafed Walda, a Libyan-born archaeologist and research fellow at King's College, London. Few records of the treasure survive, making it even more difficult to locate, though experts believe the collection contained ancient coins excavated from Cyrenaica in Eastern Libya, as well as statues and some jewelry dating from later periods. Rumors that artifacts from the collection have surfaced in Egypt and in Tripoli are unconfirmed, and the race to find the treasure is ongoing. So what can be done to prevent such thefts occurring in future and how to retrieve stolen items? ""We have very different outcomes with these things,"" admitted Bandarin. ""The recovery of objects stolen from the museum in Baghdad [during the U.S.-led invasion in 2003] was relatively successful, most of the things were returned but this one is high risk,"" he said. Authorities have some tools at their disposal: The 1970 Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property, and the 1954 Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict. In the case of Libya, precise co-ordinates for major sites of archaeological interest were given to NATO so that they could avoid them during bombing raids. But it is the theft of antiquities and their eventual sale that worries Bandarin most. ""It remains the fourth or fifth biggest criminal industry in the world,"" he said of the illegal trade, adding that countries with volatile governments tend to be most at risk. Paul Bennett is head of British mission ""The Society for Libyan Studies,"" which promotes and co-ordinates the activities of scholars working on the archaeology, history, linguistics and natural history of Libya. ""It is certain that there are organized bands of antiquities thieves going across the border into Egypt,"" he said, citing reports of grave robbing in sites in Libya. ""The problem is on the border [with Egypt], it's become very porous. We need to see far more collaboration going on between the border patrols to stop the illicit trade in antiquities,"" he said. ""We do have to mobilize the Egyptians because clearly, the treasure has gone through Egypt, as that is the closest border,"" said Bandarin. ""But even Egypt is not in the best position to help right now,"" he continued. Awareness of the problem of cultural crimes is one of the biggest challenges UNESCO faces. ""It's considered less of a crime, for reasons I don't understand,"" agreed Bandarin. He hopes UNESCO will one day be as successful in combating the trade as his colleagues at the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). ""They are extremely effective, there is almost a mass consciousness about (the protection of endangered animals) and that's not the case with us,"" he said. But while the theft of the ""Benghazi Treasure"" signifies a devastating loss, Libyans are credited with doing much to protect their treasures since the fighting erupted. ""Throughout the conflict, locals did an enormous amount to keep their heritage safe, standing guard at sites and museums,"" said Bennett. ""They put themselves at risk and if it hadn't been for them, it would have been a lot worse,"" he continued. As for the missing ""Benghazi Treasure,"" it remains for auction houses and customs offices around the world to be extra vigilant. UNESCO and Interpol will do what they can to make the issue more visible, said Bandarin. The task is now for Libya to create a strong cultural administration to keep its treasures safe.","Interpol hunting for looted ""Benghazi Treasure,"" cache of objects, ancient Roman and Greek coins .

"(CNN) -- IndyCar said it has launched an investigation into the 15-vehicle wreck that claimed the life of driver Dan Wheldon and expects to have preliminary findings within weeks. The organization said Wednesday individual members of various motorsports bodies will help it determine factors involved in the fiery incident Sunday at the Las Vegas Indy 300. IndyCar said it had incorrectly stated Tuesday that the Automobile Competition Committee of the United States (ACCUS) and the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), the national and international governing organizations, were formally involved in the investigation. The violent crash raised fresh questions about safety, both in motor sports, generally, and at the Las Vegas track, specifically. Wheldon, a two-time Indianapolis 500 winner, had been pressing efforts to address such concerns. In an early October story posted on IndyCar.com, the racing series' official website, IndyCar Vice President Will Phillips singled out the 33-year-old driver, his team and Italian manufacturer Dallara for their efforts to fine-tune a safer car model for the 2012 season. Weeks ago, Wheldon was behind the wheel of a new prototype car for the IZOD IndyCar racing series -- one meant to make his sport safer. ""He's focused on what's been needed from him to provide for the feedback to Dallara and be consistent and concise,"" Phillips said then of Wheldon. ""You couldn't have asked for more."" Had he won Sunday's race, the Englishman with the ready smile and engaging manner would have earned a $5 million payout. Instead, he was near the back of the 34-car field when he got mixed up in a crash that featured numerous cars spinning out of control and bursting into flames, spewing smoke and debris. IndyCar on Tuesday said it was saddened by Wheldon's death. ""The safety of our drivers, their crews, IndyCar staff, racetrack staff and spectators is always our paramount concern,"" IndyCar said in a statement, declining to comment further on the probe. A public memorial service for Wheldon will be held on Sunday at the Conseco Fieldhouse in downtown Indianapolis, IndyCar said. A fund has been established to help provide for his family. Wheldon was survived by his wife, Susie, and two young sons. Two drivers seriously injured in the wreck -- J.R. Hildebrand and Pippa Mann -- were released Monday from the University Medical Center in Las Vegas, said IndyCar. Wheldon's death was the first for the IndyCar circuit since March 2006, when driver Paul Dana was killed in a two-car crash while warming up for the season-opening race at Homestead-Miami Speedway. One of the most famous racing deaths was that of the elder Dale Earnhardt in NASCAR's 2001 Daytona 500. Sports Illustrated senior writer Jon Wertheim said Monday that the sheer speed of race cars, and the minimal distance separating them, means danger lurks around every turn and on every straightaway. Wheldon, for example, was bunched with several other vehicles cruising at about 220 mph when Sunday's crash occurred. ""The fact of the matter is, you're dealing with very, very fast automobiles. They're not heavy cars,"" Wertheim said. ""There is, unfortunately, an assumption of risk when you get into one of those race cars."" Beyond questions about racing's safety generally, the condition of the Las Vegas Motor Speedway -- and whether or not it was too fast and too crammed with vehicles -- was the subject of intense questioning in the hours after Wheldon's death. Driver Dario Franchitti told ABC News that the track offered ""nowhere to get away from anybody."" ""This is not a suitable track, and we've seen it today,"" he said. The loop in Las Vegas is 1.5 miles, one mile shorter than the iconic Indianapolis Motor Speedway. At the same time, it is wider than many others -- such that more cars can run alongside, and potentially collide with, one another. CNN's Greg Botelho and David Close contributed to this report.","Public memorial service for Wheldon will be held Sunday .

"(CNN) -- A bill moving through Congress is intended, on its surface at least, to do something relatively simple: Crack down on the illegal pirating of movies, music and other copyrighted material. But a major online backlash has evolved, with everyone from lawmakers to Web-freedom advocates to some of technology's biggest players calling it a greedy and dangerous overreach that could have a chilling effect on free speech and innovation. Google, Yahoo and Facebook are among the Web heavyweights who have joined the chorus against the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), which backers hope to have ready for a vote by the end of the year. Its intent is to help put a stop to foreign websites that illegally post, and sometimes sell, intellectual property from the United States. Federal law-enforcement agencies would be empowered to shut down those sites, and cut off advertising and online payments to them. ""The Stop Online Piracy Act helps stop the flow of revenue to rogue websites and ensures that the profits from American innovations go to American innovators,"" Rep. Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican, chairman of the powerful House Judiciary committee and the sponsor of the plan, said when the bill was introduced last month. ""The bill prevents online thieves from selling counterfeit goods in the U.S., expands international protections for intellectual property, and protects American consumers from dangerous counterfeit products. "" Its supporters include some powerful lobbying groups, including the Motion Picture Association of America, the pharmaceutical industry and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. On the other side are Web-freedom advocates, who were quick to say the effort goes too far. And this week, in the wake of a Wednesday hearing on the plan, that discontent grew louder and more widespread. ""Our government is tampering with its basic structure so people will maybe buy more Hollywood movies,"" says an animated video by Kirby Ferguson, the New York filmmaker behind the Web video series ""Everything Is a Remix,"" that is making the rounds online. ""But Hollywood movies don't get grassroots candidates elected. They don't overthrow corrupt regimes, and the entire entertainment industry doesn't even contribute that much to our economy. The Internet does all these and more."" Perhaps tellingly, that video was made in response to an earlier bill proposed in the Senate, which has since been put on hold by its sponsor. Ferguson has since added a message at the end of the video saying the issue has ""gotten much worse."" Some critics fear that enforcement of the act is ill-defined and could allow federal authorities to go after sites that don't set out to illegally broadcast or sell content. For example, advocates say, YouTube has housed important content, like video of political unrest in places like Egypt and Iran where government crackdowns had otherwise blocked media access. But YouTube also is home, albeit against its will, to music videos, movie clips and other content posted without the intent of its creators. Under SOPA, they say, a fledgling YouTube could have been shut down because of those posts. This week, a letter opposing the House and Senate bills was sent to Congress, signed off on by AOL, eBay, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Mozilla, Twitter, Yahoo and Zynga. ""We support the bills' stated goals -- providing additional enforcement tools to combat foreign 'rogue' websites that are dedicated to copyright infringement or counterfeiting,"" the letter reads. ""Unfortunately, the bills as drafted would expose law-abiding U.S. Internet and technology companies to new uncertain liabilities, private rights of action and technology mandates that would require monitoring of websites. ""We are concerned that these measures pose a serious risk to our industry's continued track record of innovation and job-creation, as well as to our nation's cybersecurity."" To coincide with Wednesday's committee hearing, many websites devoted themselves to drawing attention to the debate. Blog platform Tumblr blacked out images in users' posts with a message urging users to ""Stop The Law That Will Censor The Internet!"" A post on Tumblr's staff blog claimed users flooded House lawmakers Wednesday with 87,834 phone calls protesting the bill. The backlash seems to be spreading to the halls of Congress. On Thursday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, announced her opposition to the plan on Twitter. ""Need to find a better solution than #SOPA #DontBreakTheInternet,"" she wrote, using hashtags that opponents have used to show their disapproval on the site. Even Pelosi's opponents from the other side of the ideological aisle agreed with her. Influential California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa joined other conservative lawmakers, including presidential candidates Michele Bachmann and Ron Paul, in opposing the proposed law. ""I don't believe this bill has any chance on the House floor,"" Issa told The Hill on Wednesday. ""I think it's way too extreme, it infringes on too many areas that our leadership will know is simply too dangerous to do in its current form.""","Bill to fight online piracy being hit by huge Web-freedom backlash .

"Rome (CNN) -- Mario Monti, the economist nominated to become Italy's new prime minister, began talks with political leaders Monday to discuss forming a government. The 68-year-old's talks with political parties will continue Tuesday. In comments after several meetings Monday, Monti said some of the delegations had discussed a ""temporal outlook"" for how long his government might last. The time for the government ""which I am trying to create is that period between today and the end of spring 2013,"" he said, according to a CNN translation. At any time the parliament could dissolve his government ""because of lack of trust,"" he said. It is ""obvious"" that the task at hand is an emergency, and that to achieve economic growth and social equity ""should be the priorities,"" Monti said. The new prime minister designate will face an arduous task, as Italy has one of the highest national debts in Europe at â‚¬1.9 trillion ($2.6 trillion) -- about 120% of GDP -- and has seen low growth in recent years. To take the helm, Monti needs the approval of the Italian Parliament, which is composed of multiple parties with diverse interests. Silvio Berlusconi's People of Freedom party remains the strongest force in parliament, and Berlusconi has said he plans to remain active in it. Those diverse political interests and the pain of austerity measures could weigh heavily on Monti as he steers Italy through economically troubled waters. Some politicians in Italy have already called for elections to take place sooner than their scheduled time of spring 2013. Italian party leaders spoke in support of the new prime minister designate on Italy's senate TV after exiting deliberations with Monti on the composition of a new government. Antonio Di Pietro, leader of the Values Party, said his group is ""happy that the Berlusconi government could be replaced by the Monti government."" His party will not block a Monti-led government, he said. But when asked specifically whether he would give Monti a vote of confidence, Di Pietro stressed that he would not answer until he learned more about Monti's plans and the composition of his Cabinet. Franceso Rutelli, leader of the Alliance for Italy, also told reporters his block will support Monti's government. Emma Bonino of the Radical Party expressed support for Monti as well. Speaking to reporters, Bonino called for reforms to address Italy's political and economic crisis. Monti was nominated Sunday to replace Silvio Berlusconi as Italy's prime minister. Berlusconi resigned Saturday amid the country's ongoing financial crisis. His role in Italy's political future is uncertain. ""For the time being he is waiting to see what is happening under the buildup of the new government under Mr. Monti,"" said Deborah Bergamini, a member of Italy's Parliament and former assistant to Berlusconi. On Monday, Bergamini said Berlusconi told her he wants to continue acting as the chair of his PDL party. Berlusconi's resignation was greeted with cheers and dancing in the streets, as people waved the Italian flag and sang the nation's anthem. If he becomes prime minister, Monti could bring a distinctly different approach to governing than Italy has experienced over the past three years. ""It may be that the strong opposition ... against Berlusconi that has been going on in these years maybe will disperse itself, maybe will finish, and then we'll have a cooperative approach on the part of all the political forces. ... Let's hope that the international credibility of Mr. Monti will be able to work in this direction,"" Bergamini told CNN. While the hot-blooded Berlusconi was for many years a master of forming political alliances, Monti is known for his achievements as a ""Eurocrat,"" at the heart of Europe's institutions. Dubbed Super Mario for his work in international finance, he served as a leading European Commission member for a decade -- including as commissioner for its financial services, market and taxation committee between 1995 and 1999 and as head of its competition committee from 1999 to 2004. In announcing Monti's nomination, Italian President Giorgio Napolitano said the former European Union commissioner is ""gifted, competent, experienced"" and well-respected in Europe and internationally. ""This is the moment of his test,"" Napolitano said. Monti must return to Napolitano within days to accept the nomination fully, at which point he would be sworn in and officially become prime minister. Within days of the oath of office, Monti would have to go to parliament to present his government -- essentially his Cabinet and his government plan. The upper and lower houses of parliament have 10 days from the time Monti is sworn in to hold separate votes of confidence on the new government. Berlusconi is the second prime minister to resign this month over the debt crisis sweeping across Europe. Greece's George Papandreou was replaced Wednesday by Lucas Papademos, a former European Central Bank official. Investors were watching Italian bond yields closely Monday, after â‚¬3 billion worth of five-year bonds generated decent demand. Yields on both the five-year and 10-year bonds still remain around 6.5%. Last week, the 10-year Italian yield spiked to a record high above 7% -- a level that eventually led to bailouts for Greece, Portugal and Ireland. Economists said Monday's bond yields could indicate that markets are still nervous about Italy's economic prospects, even with Monti in charge. ""Now what we are seeing today is that markets probably don't like so much politics being so effective and so active in financial matters. So my feeling is that the challenge today will be rebalancing ... politics and financial matters,"" Bergamini told CNN Monday. CNN's Hada Messia, Matthew Chance, Laura Smith-Spark and Zain Verjee and the CNNMoney staff contributed to this report.","Monti says his government would aim to continue through spring 2013 .

"(CNN) -- Carlos Tevez will face disciplinary action from Manchester City after the Argentina striker's apparent refusal to come on as a substitute during a European Champions League match with Bayern Munich. City said in a statement on Wednesday that Tevez, 27, had a case to answer in relation to ""breach of contract"", having conducted an investigation into the events which occurred during the club's 2-0 defeat at the Allianz Arena on September 27. The former club captain was suspended by City following the incident, but the statement also confirmed Tevez was expected to return to training with manager Roberto Mancini's team on Thursday. Tevez strike is sad for soccer . ""The club has now reached a stage in its investigation where it has concluded that there is a case for Carlos Tevez to answer of alleged breaches of contract,"" read the statement on City's official website. ""Accordingly, the club has informed him that he will face disciplinary proceedings and the hearing will be convened shortly. Carlos will be required to report to Roberto Mancini for training on Thursday."" British newspaper The Guardian reported every player and coach interviewed during City's investigation refused to back-up Tevez's claims that the events in Munich were the result of a ""misunderstanding"" between himself and Italian coach Mancini. The publication goes on to claim Tevez will be hit with a six-week fine, which could be as much as $2.3 million dollars given the former Corinthians star's alleged $392,000-per-week wages. The multi-million dollar figure would represent the largest sanction ever handed to a footballer in Britain. Tevez denied he had refused to take to the pitch against Bayern, saying in his own statement following the match with the German outfit: ""I wish to state that I never refused to play. ""There was some confusion on the bench and I believe my position may have been misunderstood. Going forward I am ready to play when required and to fulfil my obligations."" Tevez suspended by Manchester City . One-time West Ham forward Tevez has been consistently linked with a move away from City over the past 12 months, after handing in a transfer request in December 2010. The former Boca Juniors players also saw a move back to Corinthians fall through in July, with the Brazilian outfit claiming there was insufficient time to complete the deal before the close of the transfer window. Tevez is yet to score for City this season having been their top marksman last campaign with 20 English Premier League goals. The Citziens return to domestic action this weekend, with Aston Villa visiting the Etihad Stadium on Saturday.","Manchester City say Carlos Tevez has a case to answer of breach of contract .

"(CNN) -- The South African Football Association (SAFA) have appealed to the Confederation of African Football (CAF) after the country failed to qualify for the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations due to misinterpreting the tournament's rules. South Africa celebrated on Saturday believing a 0-0 draw at home to Sierra Leone in Nelspruit had secured them top spot in qualification Group G due to their superior goal difference over their opponents and rivals Niger. But it emerged Niger would advance to next year's tournament in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea as a result of their superior head-to-head record against South Africa and Sierra Leone, despite suffering a 3-0 defeat to bottom side Egypt in Cairo. ""We have noted that CAF has announced that Niger has qualified in our group,"" read a letter sent by SAFA to CAF. ""Despite South Africa finishing on top of the group in terms of goal difference, which is the universally recognized means of separating teams who are equal on points. Big names miss out on 2012 Africa Cup of Nations . ""We believe that the team finishing top of the log at the end of the competition is automatically determined at the end of 90 minutes play, and that the second place is determined by the other rules. ""We will lay out our objection more fully shortly, but in the meantime wish to signal that we intend to challenge this interpretation and application of the rules."" SAFA president Kirsten Nematandani was defiant after the match, insisting the organization would challenge a lack of clarity in the tournament's rules. ""Do not despair, all is not lost,"" said Nematandani. ""We believe we have a case and we will carry this fight all the way. ""If CAF's rules are ambiguous then we need to challenge that and we are well within our rights to do so. In the meantime be positive, and leave everything in our hands."" South Africa hosted football's biggest tournament last year when they became the first African country to stage a World Cup, but the team known as Bafana Bafana have now failed to reach two consecutive Cup of Nations. It also proved to be a shocking qualifying campaign for Egypt, with the Pharaohs missing out on next year's event having won the last three tournaments in a row. Egypt, the most successful team in the history of the Cup of Nations having won it seven times, recently appointed former U.S. coach Bob Bradley in an attempt to reverse their current fortunes. Two-time winners Nigeria have also missed out on the 2012 competition after Guinea scored a late equalizer in a 2-2 draw on Saturday, to book their place in next year's tournament at the expense of the Super Eagles.","South Africa have appeal after missing out on 2012 African Cup of Nations .

"(CNN) -- The Philippine Commission on Elections approved fraud charges Friday against former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and several other former officials, state media reported. Arroyo is charged in connection with the alleged manipulation of results during 2007 Senate elections, according to the Philippines News Agency. The former president has denied any wrongdoing. Arroyo was stopped from leaving the country Tuesday as she was trying to board a plane at Manila's Ninoy Aquino International Airport, hours after the country's Supreme Court overruled government-imposed restrictions on her travels. The Supreme Court again Friday rejected the government's travel ban, saying she was free to leave as long as she posted a bond and met other requirements, said Jose Midas Marquez, a court spokesman . Arroyo was reportedly boarding the flight to seek medical treatment abroad for her bone disease diagnosed earlier this year, following three unsuccessful spinal operations in the Philippines. She arrived at the airport in an ambulance and was transported to the departure gate in a wheelchair while wearing a neck brace. Arroyo's lawyer, Raul Lambino, said the former first couple was ""subjected to indignity and embarrassment at the airport,"" calling the government's defiance of the Supreme Court order ""abhorrent and in violation of the rights of the individual guaranteed by the (Philippine's) constitution and the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights."" But presidential spokesman Edwin Lacierda described the situation as ""all high drama,"" according to media reports. ""They (the Arroyos) want the public to sympathize with them,"" he added. He said that while the Arroyo couple would be treated with dignity, the government would be ""firm in our decision not to allow them to leave the country."" Arroyo's husband, Jose Miguel Arroyo, is also accused of corruption. The Supreme Court, which is mostly staffed by judges hired under Arroyo, defied current President Benigno Aquino's state mandate of investigating allegations of corruption during Arroyo's 2001-2010 presidential term.

"(CNN) -- A Polish court has ordered the detention of a man accused of holding his daughter captive for six years and repeatedly raping her, ultimately fathering two children with her. The accusations recall the case of Josef Fritzl, who kept his daughter captive for 24 years and fathered seven children. The man, whose name was not released, was arrested Monday, Polish national police said in a statement. The court on Tuesday ordered him jailed for three months pending a trial. The charges against him were not immediately known. Police said they arrested the man at the train station in Siedlce, a town between Warsaw and the border with Belarus. Police said they believed he was trying to escape abroad. The investigation began last week when the man's 21-year-old daughter approached police in Siemiatycze, in eastern Poland, accompanied by her mother, police said. The daughter spent several hours talking with a policewoman, detailing her alleged ordeal over the past six years, police said. She described living through a ""hell"" that involved rape, beatings, and being kept as a slave, police said. In 2005, the woman said, she gave birth to a boy at a hospital in Wroclaw, in southwestern Poland, police said. Two years later, in 2007, she gave birth to a boy at a hospital in Siemiatycze, in eastern Poland, also near the border with Belarus, police said. Both times, the woman told police, she left the baby in the hospital, a common practice in Poland when the mother wants to give her children up for adoption, police said. Police did not say how the daughter managed to escape her alleged ordeal or whether the mother was aware of what had gone on. Police themselves acknowledged many facts were still unclear. ""There are still a lot of questions to which answers have to be found,"" the statement from the national police said. The case has drawn comparisons to the shocking incest case in Austria in which Josef Fritzl is accused of holding his daughter captive in an underground network of tiny rooms for 24 years. Fritzl repeatedly raped his daughter, Elisabeth, and fathered seven children with her, six of whom survived. All of the children were born in captivity. That case became public when Elisabeth's oldest child, 19-year-old Kerstin, became ill and fell unconscious in April. Elisabeth persuaded her father to let her bring Kerstin to a hospital, where staff grew suspicious and called police, who opened an investigation and uncovered the abuse. Kerstin and her family are now recovering and slowly adapting to modern life, Austrian authorities have said.

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- Longtime Philadelphia Daily News sports columnist Bill Conlin will not face prosecution over child sex abuse allegations -- even if there were grounds for charges -- because the statute of limitations concerning the alleged crimes has expired, according to prosecutors. The claims were published in an article by The Philadelphia Inquirer on Tuesday after an investigation was initiated by authorities, according to a statement from Bernard Weisenfeld, a spokesman for the Gloucester County Prosecutor's Office in New Jersey. The article says three women and a man allege they were molested by Conlin in the 1970s when they were between the ages of 7 and 12. One of the alleged victims is Conlin's niece, said Slade McLaughlin, an attorney who represents three of the accusers. A spokesman for the Daily News said the newspaper had no knowledge of the allegations prior to The Inquirer's story. Conlin has denied the claims, speaking through his attorney. He retired from the Daily News on Tuesday, the newspaper said. ""Mr. Conlin is obviously floored by these allegations, which supposedly happened 40 years ago. He's engaged me to do everything possible to bring the facts forward to vindicate his name,"" said attorney George Bochetto. Prosecutors say an exhaustive investigation had been launched into the allegations. But, Weisenfeld said, it was later determined that even if there were legal grounds to pursue a criminal prosecution, prosecutors are barred from doing so because the alleged crimes occurred too long ago. A 1996 law actually eliminates statutes of limitations on sexual assault cases in New Jersey, but the law is not considered retroactive for claims that date back as far as the 1970s. Still, McLaughlin said, his clients want to speak out. ""They made the decision that they were going to tell their story,"" the attorney told CNN. ""This isn't a he-said, she-said story. It's a he-said, they-said. Their only motives are getting closure and public service."" McLaughlin also noted, after speaking with his clients, that the accusations made in The Inquirer's story were accurate. Conlin, 77, who gained national recognition from appearances on ESPN, could not be immediately reached for comment. The veteran sportswriter worked for the Daily News for nearly half a century. The newspaper published an editorial Wednesday written by its managing editor in an effort to address the scandal. ""I have been a journalist for more than a quarter century, and I have never had a professional experience that was sadder â€” or more shocking â€” than reading the allegations leveled against Bill Conlin yesterday,"" wrote Larry Platt. ""We've taken the unusual step of also running (the Inquirer's story), in its entirety, on the following page, because I felt you deserved to see the allegations in full context,"" he added. Still, Platt reminded readers that Conlin has not been charged with a crime. The Inquirer and the Daily News are owned by a parent company, Philadelphia Media Network. This week's allegations come in the wake of a series of recent child sex abuse scandals, including the case against former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky, who faces more than 50 counts of child sex abuse spread over several years. Conlin, who covered sports throughout Pennsylvania for the newspaper, weighed in on the Penn State scandal last month in a column published by the Daily News titled ""Tough Guys Are Talking About Sandusky."" Conlin expressed doubt about those who said they would have intervened on behalf of a child, had they witnessed the boy's alleged molestation at the hands of Sandusky in a university locker room shower. ""Everybody says he will do the right thing, get involved, put his own ass on the line before or after the fact,"" Conlin wrote in a column published on November 11. ""But the moment itself has a cruel way of suspending our fearless intentions.""","Longtime Philadelphia sports columnist Bill Conlin has been accused of sexual abuse .

"(CNN) -- Getting the details out of his head and on to paper was Executive Producer Ronald D. Moore's most important priority of the day. It was the first Tuesday in March, and he had been up late the night before typing out the details of life in the ""17th Precinct,"" an innovative new world in which police detectives relied on magic, not forensics, to catch criminals. Writing the ""show bible"" was Moore's way of conveying his vision to his cast and crew. Until a couple of months ago, these ideas existed only in his head. This one document would spell out every detail of life, from the way detectives picked apart a crime scene to the way they could make evidence float off the ground for closer forensic examination. The concept had already taken shape at Sony, where executives had teamed with Moore's Tall Ship Productions for content. It was then successfully pitched to NBC, where executives agreed to fund the pilot. After that, Moore's professional life became a frenzied ballet of scripting, casting, coordinating artwork and setting production schedules. He was now just a week away from a table read with the cast, and he already had a crew scouting shoot locations in and around Vancouver. Geeky interests linger . The excitement was palpable. In a way, it reminded him of the feeling he had as a 5-year-old boy sitting in his Chowchilla, California, living room decades earlier. When Neil Armstrong took his first uncharted steps on the moon, Moore watched with a sense of awe. For him, a whole new world was unfolding. ""I wrote letters to NASA in first and second grade, and then I found 'Lost in Space,' "" Moore recalls. ""In third grade, I discovered 'Star Trek,' and that was the defining show of my life. Channel 26, four o'clock every afternoon."" As Moore got older, he explored the jock route, playing football and running track in high school. He eventually became a self-described ""baseball fanatic,"" but that sense of discovery and exploration stayed with him and led to a writing job on ""Star Trek: The Next Generation."" A stint with ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" followed and helped launch his budding career as well as helping him earn status with a generation of nerds, even if he never really considered himself a part of that culture. ""I've never really thought of myself as a nerd, which is not to say others haven't thought it of me. I have referred to myself as a geek from time to time, and my wife sometimes calls me the 'King of the Geeks,' although considering the hierarchical status of Steve Jobs, George Lucas, et al., a mere prince might be more accurate."" Like other television writers who eventually move up to become producers, executive producers and, sometimes show runners, Moore was building a body of work that was gaining attention. Running the show . Eventually, it would be his executive producer role in the reimagined ""Battlestar Galactica"" series that would draw the most critical acclaim. It was also the first time Moore had been a co-creator on a show from beginning to end. He and Executive Producer David Eick just seemed to click. ""Ron is the scariest writer I know"" his former producing partner recalls. ""I'm not sure there's anything he can't do remarkably well. Even within the context of 'Battlestar,' there was such a wild panoply of styles and emotions -- action, tragedy, melodrama, comedy, philosophy, even music -- all of which I watched him nail."" ""But he's also weirdly unpretentious,"" Eick said. ""We'd argue about whether something worked, but never whether or not it was 'good,' because if you tell Ron something's not good, he doesn't take it personally. He just says OK and then does something great."" Moore's sense of flexibility and vision were solidifying his reputation among his cast and crew. Writer and Executive Producer Jane Espenson first met Moore while pitching show ideas for ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" as a grad student at UC Berkeley. She later joined ""Battlestar's"" writing team. ""There could be a million distractions around him -- he could be on a bad phone connection, in an airport, running for a plane, and he'd immediately grasp a complex story as five of us shouted it into a speaker phone, and he'd have the fix,"" she said. Moore was acquiring a dedicated following with the show's success. He understood how much the geek culture's acceptance by the mainstream had helped his own success as genre material had made the transformation from niche to widespread commercial viability. ""That's good and bad,"" Moore said. ""More projects get made, more material is available, but a lot of it is dumbed down for the general audience, and the intimacy of fan-run conventions is now almost a thing of the past,"" he said. ""There was a time when being a genre geek meant you were part of a secret club, and when you wore your Nostromo ball cap (from 'Alien') or your HAL-9000 T-shirt ('2001'), the other club members were the only ones who recognized the colors you were flying, and it was a way of connecting. Now it's all commercialized and merchandized and everyone's a geek. Guess that's the price you pay for success."" With ""Battlestar,"" Moore had success in spades. He had led a team that was honored with a Peabody Award, and Moore himself was nominated for an Emmy for best writing in a dramatic series, followed by an Emmy win for the ""Battlestar Galactica"" webisodes. The show had been a true test of courage and strength and had brought with it valuable lessons in how to run a show. ""The show runners that I know are willing to charge into the barricades over and over again, and you have to be willing to get back up again,"" Moore said. ""You're constantly fighting battles every day with executives, or directors or actors. You are constantly fighting, and you lose a fair number of battles, but the guys just keep going."" But even as he accepted critical praise for ""Battlestar,"" there was a line from another scene running through his head. It came from the movie ""Patton,"" in which the famous general described victorious Romans returning from battle in triumphant chariots: ""A slave stood behind the conqueror holding a golden crown and whispering in his ear a warning: that all glory is fleeting."" The new journey . By the end of March, Moore was wrapping up shooting for ""17th Precinct."" He was guardedly optimistic. He had seen strong performances from the actors, had seen some beautiful effects come to life, and had even been a little surprised by how some of the characters had popped onscreen. He had been in the business long enough to know that what he had in his head would seldom compare to what was actually shot. Still, he had a feeling this was going to be good. That morning, he watched a scene being edited in which the cops were using magic to dissect a crime scene. They set up a perimeter and effectively flipped a switch, setting off the magic that literally lifted blood from the ground so that they could see it from all angles. There was no doubt in his mind that this show was going to be something new and memorable. Being an executive producer had its share of tough days and moments where there seemed to be a rush of decisions and nervous energy, but mostly, Moore found it to be calm and enjoyable. Everything was still new, and he felt like he was falling in love every day. As he returned to L.A. for final post-production work, a deadline loomed in his head. He had to have the show turned over to the executives at NBC by May 2. He'd make it, but he knew that the weeks of waiting that would follow would be nerve-racking. The delivery . May 2 came and went. The show was turned over, but Moore and his team probably wouldn't hear anything until the 16th. Two full weeks of misery, wasted nervous energy, reading tea leaves and seemingly endless speculation with his agent. But bad news came early. On May 12, the phone rang. NBC had decided to pass on ""17th Precinct,"" and with that, nine months of Moore's creative vision came to an end. ""It was an ambitious project to take on, it was something different. I was just so close to it. It's hard after shows like ""Battlestar"" to not have equal measures of success after that. That's a personal thing I have to keep in mind."" So Ron Moore was literally at the beginning again, already plotting a new course and determined to make the experience worthwhile. ""There are creative lessons I'm trying to draw from, and there were some conceptual mistakes I probably made. But at the same time, you kind of balance that with the knowledge that each one of these projects is unique and they are all special."" As he sat down to go through his drawer of untapped ideas for what comes next, Moore remembered that famous line: All glory is fleeting. But as he's proved, it's also attainable.","Watching the moon landing as a child inspired Ron Moore's work on TV shows .

"SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- Kim Jong Un issued his first military orders as leader of North Korea just before the death of his father was announced, a South Korean state-run news agency said Wednesday. Citing ""a South Korean source,"" Yonhap reported that Kim ""ordered all military units to halt field exercises and training and return to their bases."" The source called it a sign that Kim Jong Il's son, believed to be in his late 20s, had taken ""complete control over the military,"" Yonhap reported. An intelligence official said North Korea may be trying to prevent attempted defections as the country goes through a tumultuous transition, the report said. In Seoul, questions have been raised over why South Korean intelligence was apparently unaware of Kim Jong Il's death until the official announcement. Both Won Sei Hoon, who heads South Korea's National Intelligence Service, and Defense Minister Kim Kwan Jim ""came under fire"" after admitting they learned of the death from TV news coverage, Yonhap reported. Just over the border in Dandong, China, CNN spoke with a defector who was scared of North Korean spies watching him. ""North Koreans don't speak openly,"" the man said. ""If anyone knows I'm talking, I would be sent to prison and there's no mercy there. I would be shot dead."" He painted a grim picture of life in North Korea, where he said people are starving, aid is scarce, and the only operating factories serve the military. ""Pig feed, that's all we can eat,"" he says, adding, ""There is no food, not even food from China. It's been blocked for three years."" His son and daughter remain inside North Korea. He crosses back and forth every six months to keep his family alive. He told CNN he fears a desperate country with a potential power vacuum that could lash out. Before Kim Jong Il died, ""he was preparing the country for war and death, and to hand power to Kim Jong Un,"" the man said. Other North Koreans in Dandong were openly weeping over the death of their ""dear leader,"" as he was called in his country. North Korean state-run news agency KCNA, meanwhile, carried messages praising Kim Jong Il. The top story on the agency's English language website Wednesday, dated Tuesday, said Kim Jong Il ""dedicated himself to the happiness of the people all his life."" ""He had a noble wish,"" the KCNA report said. ""It was to bring the greatest happiness and honor to the people even if he had plucked a star from the sky and grown flowers even on a rock.""

"(CNN) -- News stories saying authorities thwarted a plot to bomb the U.S. Embassy in Mexico are not true, the Mexican secretary of the navy said Tuesday. At least two Mexican media outlets published a supposed internal report on the plot that had been leaked to the media. But the navy said the report is ""fake."" In a statement released Tuesday afternoon, only hours after the news stories were published, the navy said it ""categorically rejects the authorship of the alleged report in possession of some media outlets."" ""The print seals and watermarks that appear on the document, as well as its format, do not correspond to the ones utilized by this federal government agency,"" the release read. The secretary of the navy reported in June 2010 that four people had been detained for allegedly being in possession of 20 kilograms of explosives in the Roma neighborhood of Mexico City. According to the stories published by the two Mexican media outlets, the finding was related to a plot by the Somali terrorist group Al-Shabaab to attack the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City. Reports of a possible explosives cache came to the U.S. State Department in June 2010, according to a State Department source. A Somali citizen was arrested, but when Mexican authorities looked into the matter, they found nothing conclusive, said the source, who asked not to be identified. The suspect was then released, the source said. The Mexican president's office and the Mexican Embassy in Washington told CNN they had no information regarding the alleged plot. Officials with the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in Washington also denied any knowledge of the report.","NEW: A source at the U.S. State Department says a Somali citizen was arrested in 2010 and released .

"Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) -- Nepal's parliament on Sunday elected a leader of the former Maoist rebels as the new prime minister with a simple majority. Baburam Bhattarai, 57, vice-chairman of the Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) will become the fourth prime minister since Nepal became a republic in 2008. After his election Bhattarai said he would attempt to complete the peace process and the long-delayed new constitution. Bhattarai received 340 votes in parliament, beating his rival Ram Chandra Poudel, 66, of the Nepali Congress, who received 235 votes. Bhattarai, who has a degree in architecture and a doctorate in regional planning, was able to get the crucial support of the regional Madhesi parties from southern Nepal. The 65 votes of the five parties of the Madhesi front were crucial for Bhattrai, whose party is the biggest in the 601-member parliament but lacks a majority. Media reports say the Madhesi parties have been promised 12 ministerial posts in exchange for their support. Bhattari is the second leader of the former rebels to become prime minister. The Maoists became the biggest party in the 2008 elections and their chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal was prime minister for nine months. He resigned in a dispute with the president, who reinstated an army chief Dahal had fired. Earlier this month Jhalanath Khanal resigned as prime minister after he was unable to persuade the former Maoist rebels to demobilize and reintegrate their fighters in a deal that was agreeable to the other political parties. The Maoists fought a ten-year insurgency from 1996 to 2006 in which about 16,000 people were killed. According to the peace deal that ended the uprising, 19,602 United Nations-verified combatants should be integrated into the security forces, but the political parties are yet to agree on the number and the method. Nepal also faces the challenge of preparing a republican constitution and political parties have twice extended the deadline to prepare the constitution. The new deadline expires on Wednesday and political parties look likely to have to come to an agreement to extend the deadline a third time.","Baburam Bhattarai wins a simple majority with regional party backing .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Libyans celebrated late into the evening Saturday the reported capture of Moammar Gadhafi's son, Saif al-Islam, nabbed in a desert gunbattle after an 18-day stakeout. Senior Libyan military officials said they believe the potential Gadhafi successor was trying to make his way to neighboring Niger, where a brother, Saadi, was granted asylum. Revolutionary fighters caught the man wanted by the International Criminal Court between the southwestern oasis town of Obari and southern town of Sabha, military commanders in Tripoli told CNN. The 39-year-old, the last Gadhafi fugitive, was taken to the city of Zintan in the western mountains. Top officials in the town rejoiced over the development. Saif al-Islam had been on the run since shortly after the fall of his father's Bab al-Aziziya compound in the capital in August. ""I hope that this is the beginning of a state of freedom, transparency and lawfulness,"" acting Prime Minister Abdurrahim El-Keib told reporters in Zintan. ""In the name of the great nation, we would like to allay your fears and tell you that Saif and those who were with him will be tried fairly. They are ensured all their rights under the law. These are the same rights that our nation didn't have for 42 years."" The ICC in the Netherlands wants Saif al-Islam for alleged crimes against humanity, including murder, committed during the uprising this year. But officials in Libya also indicated they would like to put Saif al-Islam on trial. Although he held no high-level government office, Saif al-Islam was considered by ICC prosecutors to be Moammar Gadhafi's ""unspoken successor and the most influential person with his inner circle,"" according to an arrest warrant issued in June. The Gadhafi regime formulated a state policy that included quelling demonstrations by lethal force, attacking civilians and imprisoning hundreds, according to the warrant. Saif al-Islam ""exercised control over crucial parts of the state apparatus, including finances and logistics and had the powers of a de facto prime minister."" ICC Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo said the arrest was ""good news."" ""That is very important because we consider him -- the judges consider him -- the principal, with his father Moammar, of the crimes committed in Libya after February 13,"" he said. ""He's arrested, he's alive, and now he will face justice and that is the most important news."" Moreno-Ocampo will travel to Libya next week to coordinate efforts to bring Saif al-Islam to justice, an ICC spokeswoman said Saturday. Who is Saif al-Islam Gadhafi? ""The ICC has had indirect contact with Saif al-Islam Gadhafi through intermediaries during which they discussed what would happen if he surrendered. The last contact was 25 days ago,"" spokeswoman Florence Olara told CNN. ICC spokesman Fadi el-Abdallah told CNN that Libya has an obligation to surrender Saif al-Islam to the ICC. If Libya wants to conduct a trial, it needs to submit a request to judges and show its legal system is capable of properly handling such a proceeding. El-Keib emphasized that ""we will deal with this under our legal system,"" but he said the country intends to communicate and work with the ICC. ""We'll get to a point where we can take care of this issue easily,"" El Keib said. ""We definitely are interested in respecting the will of our people and also the national interests that we trust that the world will also appreciate."" Justice Minister Mohammad Al-Alagy said he doubts Libyan courts would want to try Saif al-Islam for crimes against humanity. ""We will weigh out the accusations against Saif Al Islam al-Gadhafi. Afterward, we will know what crimes to try him with. He's charged with killing and taking the nation's money and ... hiring mercenaries. Those are crimes the Libyan nation will currently try him for. We can't move ahead of ourselves with inaccurate accusations. We will move forward with this investigation."" Military commanders told CNN they want the National Transitional Council to ensure Saif al-Islam is tried in their country. Outbursts of celebratory gunfire, the honking of horns and cries of joy could be heard in Tripoli as reports of his capture spread. Othman Mliegta, commander of the Al Qa'aq brigades, said he had been told that Saif al-Islam was slightly injured in the clashes that took place when the fighters attempted to capture him but is in good health. A picture released by Libya's National Transitional Council purportedly of Saif al-Islam appeared to show him half-lying on a low bed with bandages wrapped around the fingers of his right hand. A military commander from Zintan, Fathi Al-Ayed, told CNN that the injuries had been sustained in previous clashes rather than the firefight that led to his capture in the early hours of Saturday. Al-Ayed, who was in Obari at the time, said fighters from the Zintan Brigades had been following a vehicle convoy. As they approached, the convoy tried to flee, firing on the fighters, who returned fire. When the convoy was eventually stopped, Saif al-Islam was arrested, along with up to six others. They were taken to Zintan. Mliegta said those with Saif al-Islam when he was caught did not include his father's former intelligence chief Abdulla al-Sanussi, also wanted by the ICC. French and British officials, part of the NATO mission that supported the rebels since February, welcomed the capture. ""Saif al-Islam no longer poses a threat to peace and security in Libya,"" said British Foreign Secretary William Hague. ""His arrest will allow the Libyan people to move on to the challenge of rebuilding their country."" Time.com: The reformer who refused to reform . The suspect's father, who ruled the country for more than 40 years, was killed last month near Sirte after his capture by forces loyal to the National Transitional Council. Asked about guarantees of Saif al-Islam's safety, Mliegta said he would be treated in the same way as any other detainee. National Transitional Council military liaison Abdelrahman Busin told CNN that any injuries Saif al-Islam had sustained would be treated. There was still some secrecy over his movements, Busin said, but he could guarantee Saif al-Islam's human rights would be respected if he is handed over to authorities in Tripoli. Giving his reaction to the news of the arrest, Busin said: ""I think the Libyan people can finally actually breathe a big sigh, finally relax to some extent, because he has been threatening to come back with revenge for some time now. So, it's a close for many, many people."" A glimpse into the Gadhafi family . Once seen as a possible successor to his father and an advocate of reform, Saif al-Islam Gadhafi became a vocal defender of his father's brutal regime. His whereabouts had been unknown for months. At the end of August he made a call to Syria's Rai TV, in which he said he was speaking from a suburb of the capital, Tripoli, and urged Libyans to rise up against the rebels. Saif al-Islam, whose mother is Gadhafi's second wife, Safia, is the second-oldest son of the late strongman. He was educated at the London School of Economics and speaks fluent English.

"(CNN) -- Lebanon stunned traditional regional powerhouses South Korea 2-1 in Beirut on Tuesday to boost their hopes of qualifying for the last stage of Asia's 2014 World Cup qualifying. Lebanon lost 6-0 to the Koreans in in September's away fixture in the first game under new coach Theo Bucker, but the German has overseen a big improvement since then. Central defender Ali Al Saadi put the Middle East side ahead after just five minutes, but the visitors leveled on 20 from the spot as Koo Ja-Cheol slotted home. But the Wolfsburg midfielder blotted his copybook by tripping Mahmoud el Ali, and Abbas Atwi converted the winning penalty just after half an hour. Lebanon now trail 2002 World Cup semifinalists South Korea only on goal difference, with Kuwait two points further back ahead of the final round of Group B matches after beating United Arab Emirates 2-1. Australia booked passage to the second round of qualifying with an unconvincing 1-0 win in Thailand. Blackburn's Brett Emerton set up Brett Holman for his second-half headed winner as the Socceroos went through as Group D winners. Saudi Arabia and Oman fought to a 0-0 draw and will battle it out with Thailand to decide the second qualifying place in the final round. Iran also progressed with a game to spare, beating Indonesia 4-1 before a goalless draw in Doha between Qatar and Bahrain confirmed their qualification. Bahrain must win against Indonesia in the concluding matches on February 29, while the Qataris need a point against Iran to go through. Iraq ended China's hopes of qualifying from Group A by beating leaders Jordan 3-1 to claim the second spot. China had earlier won 4-0 against Singapore with a late Zheng Zheng double. Japan had already gone through from Group C, but the Blue Samurai's 20-match unbeaten run ended with a 1-0 defeat to bitter rivals North Korea in Pyongyang. Pak Nam Chol's 50th-minute header secured the victory, but in a bad-tempered game the home side had Jong Il Gwan sent off in the 77th minute. ""It was a physical match in a tough environment,"" Japan coach Alberto Zaccheroni told broadcaster TBS. Uzbekistan beat Tajikistan 3-0 to go three points clear at the top of the group. The top two teams from each of five groups reach the final stage, where a round-robin is played to decide on four places for the 2014 finals in Brazil. The fifth-placed team go into an intercontinental playoff. In the first round of Africa qualifying, Emmanuel Adebayor returned to international action as Togo beat Guinea-Bissau 1-0 to progress to the second stage after a first-leg draw. The Tottenham striker had retired from representing his country after the January 2010 gun attack on the Togo team bus before the African Cup of Nations. Serge Gakpe, who scored in the opening 1-1 draw, netted a second-minute winner for the Sparrowhawks. The Democratic Republic of Congo also went through after beating Swaziland 5-1 to win 8-2 on aggregate, while Congo progressed 6-1 on aggregate despite being held 1-1 by Sao Tome e Principe. Lesotho and Tanzania triumphed by virtue of the away-goals rule at the expense of Burundi and Chad respectively, despite both nations losing the second legs. Kenya, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda and 2012 Africa Cup of Nations co-hosts Equatorial Guinea also made it to the second stage.","Lebanon stun South Korea 2-1 to keep alive World Cup qualifying hopes .

"(CNN) -- State public health officials are contacting airline passengers after a woman with measles traveled through three airports earlier this week, a spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Saturday. The woman traveled from an airport in Europe to Dulles International Airport in Virginia to Denver International Airport and, finally, to New Mexico's Albuquerque International Sunport, said CDC spokesman Tom Skinner. The woman, who traveled Tuesday, was diagnosed with the disease in New Mexico, he said. Health departments in each area, using information from the CDC, are contacting those who may have been exposed to the viral disease. That may include flight crews and airport workers. ""That work is ongoing,"" said Skinner, who could not confirm the airline or airlines and the originating flight's location. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said people who were working or traveling through Concourse C at the Denver airport after 9 p.m. Tuesday should monitor themselves for any early symptoms of measles, especially fever, from Monday through March 12. ""People who develop a fever should contact their health care provider or their local or state health department. People with symptoms should not go to child care, school, work or out in public, as they might have the early symptoms of measles and might be contagious,"" the department said in a statement Friday. Typically, health officials concentrate on passengers or crew who were five rows in front of or five rows behind an infected traveler, Skinner said. They are particularly mindful of small infants and children and people with underlying medical conditions. People who had not previously been immunized may have a ""small window"" after being contacted to be vaccinated or given globulins to avoid developing symptoms, Skinner told CNN. In a separate development, measles was confirmed in a 24-year-old woman who took a flight from France and two people in Boston were suspected of having the disease. Boston officials held a free measles vaccination clinic Friday. ""Most of the [U.S.] cases are imported into the country,"" Skinner said. Measles is a very contagious viral disease that is easily spread through coughing, sneezing and secretions from the mouth. Measles develops generally seven to 14 days after a person is infected, according to the CDC. A typical case of measles begins with mild to moderate fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and sore throat. Two or three days after symptoms begin, tiny white spots may appear inside the mouth. Three to five days after the start of symptoms, a red or reddish-brown rash appears. It may spread downward from the face and be accompanied by a temperature spike, the CDC says on its website. CNN's Phil Gast contributed to this report .","The infected passenger traveled from Europe to the United States .

"(CNN) -- Exotic animals should live in the wild, not be exploited in profit-motivated zoos -- or worse â€” as ""pets"" or backyard oddities by people who have a deeply misguided sense of dominion or ownership. What happened in Ohio on Tuesday and Wednesday has drawn dramatic attention to the private possession of exotics, an issue that is a major component of Born Free USA's mission to protect wildlife. On Wednesday, 56 exotic animals â€” including lions, tigers, bears, giraffes and wolves â€” were freed from their captivity at a rural residence outside Zanesville. Police report the animals' ""owner,"" 62-year-old Terry Thompson, let the animals out of their cages before he killed himself. Forty-nine of the animals -- including 18 tigers and 17 lions -- were shot dead by law enforcement officers. Thankfully, other than Thompson's death, no human injuries have been reported as a result of this situation. Ohio has had a recent flurry of incidents in which exotic animals being held by private individuals in or outside people's residences have been involved in violent encounters with humans. In September, an 80-year-old man was attacked by a kangaroo at an exotic-animal farm in Green Camp. In June, an escaped ""pet"" grivet monkey scratched two girls while he was on the loose in Fremont. In August 2010, a bear fatally mauled its caretaker on the owner's property in Columbus Station. Born Free USA tracks such cases in our Exotic Animal Incidents Database. We list 86 incidents involving exotic animals in Ohio in recent years, and probably many other such encounters have gone unreported. Nationwide, our database lists nearly 1,600 incidents. There is no excuse for wild, potentially dangerous, exotic animals to be kept in private hands. Ohio is one of a handful of states with woefully few regulations on the books to govern such questionable close contact with wildlife, and Born Free USA has been pushing for years to get a stronger law enacted in the state. In 2006, the Ohio Legislature quickly introduced a bill to restrict private possession of exotics after an Ashtabula County woman was mauled by a 500-pound black bear that escaped a pen kept by a nearby neighbor. The bill failed, and just four years later in 2010, an emergency executive order was put in place after a 24-year-old man was mauled to death by a black bear kept in a Columbia Township compound. The order temporarily banned private ownership of big cats, bears, alligators, crocodiles and certain snakes. In April 2011, the order expired upon the promise by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources and the governor that a new rule-making process would swiftly be established in order to implement regulations regarding possession of exotics. This still has not happened. What will it take to get swift action in the state -- and in other states around the country that lack complete bans on exotic pet ownership? Will it take a bigger, more diverse animal escape? A monkeypox outbreak? People dying? There is no need to wait, no need to take this kind of dramatic and incomprehensible risk. The drain on society from keeping exotic animals as pets is not insignificant. Humane societies, sheriff's departments and wildlife sanctuaries end up bearing the brunt of the cost of placing these animals and giving them humane, lifetime care. In Texas, the Born Free USA Primate Sanctuary provides permanent, safe, naturalistic and free-range accommodations for more than 500 macaques, vervets and baboons, many of whom have been rescued from captive lives of stress, deprivation and danger -- danger to both the monkeys and to their ""owners."" Every chance we get, every day we come to work, in as many effective, forceful and creative ways we can, we encourage our members and supporters to spread the word that wild animals belong in the wild. What happened in Ohio this week is appalling. All those animals, imprisoned for no good reason. Their ""owner"" was apparently a tortured soul who took his own life and put the lives of nearby residents in peril through his bizarre act. And all those wandering animals, confused by their sudden and unfathomable ""freedom,"" were shot dead as though they were alien invaders in a safe bucolic land. None of that had to happen. It could have been avoided. Private possession of exotic animals is inexcusable and it puts human lives at risk. When will we, as a civilization, learn that wild animals are just as entitled to live freely on this planet as we are and it is our duty and obligation to ensure that this is possible? Maybe, just maybe, the wildlife slaughter on the streets of Ohio will finally spur the change we need for safer and more compassionate communities across the country. He says 18 tigers and 17 lions were among them. Six animals were taken to the Columbus Zoo.","Will Travers: Exotic animals must not be exploited as ""pets"" or backyard oddities .

"London (CNN) -- A top executive at the company that publishes the Wall Street Journal left Dow Jones this week amid allegations that the paper's European edition used underhanded methods to boost circulation figures, the newspaper itself reported Thursday. Andrew Langhoff, the executive, left on Tuesday, following an internal probe which found he had pushed for two articles favorable to a company involved in the alleged circulation subterfuge, the paper said. The Guardian, a rival newspaper, alleged that the Journal's publisher secretly directed funds to the company that was buying copies of the paper in bulk. In an official statement, Dow Jones rejected the Guardian's characterization of the arrangements. Wall Street Journal Europe ""circulation programs were fully disclosed and certified,"" the company said in a statement. The controversy comes on the heels of another scandal surrounding another newspaper in the British newspaper empire of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. The News of the World, the company's flagship Sunday British tabloid, was closed in July on the orders of Murdoch's son James, following accusations that it had illegally eavesdropped on the phone of a missing girl and many others to get stories. The girl, Milly Dowler, later turned out to have been murdered. News Corp. owns both Dow Jones, which publishes the Wall Street Journal, and News International, which published News of the World and continues to publish the Sun and the Times of London. The Wall Street Journal Europe scandal centers on the allegation that the paper arranged for 12,000 copies a day to be sold, for one European cent each, to a company called Executive Learning Partnership, the Journal reported. That boosted the daily circulation of the paper to 75,000 -- meaning the bulk sales to ELP made up more than 15% of daily circulation. The number of copies a newspaper sells is important in determining how much advertisers are willing to pay for ads, among other factors. The British agency that audits circulation figures does not differentiate between papers that are sold at face value and those distributed in bulk -- unlike the American agency, the Journal said. Dow Jones said its circulation reports were above board. ""The practice of sponsored distribution to business schools and universities is common in the industry and clearly identified in all WSJE publisher statements. ELP was paid for legitimate services rendered,"" the company said. Langhoff and a Journal circulation department employee named Gert Van Mol also directed thousands of euros to ELP in side deals, the newspaper said Thursday, citing unnamed ""people familiar with the matter."" Van Mol's job has since been eliminated, the paper said. Dow Jones said the payments were for legitimate services rendered, but that the manner in which they were paid was ""admittedly complex."" It said it canceled the deal because it was uncomfortable with it, the Journal reported, also noting that ELP denied that account and that the company was ""not pleased that our name appears in this context."" ELP partner Nick Van Heck said the company had invoiced for services it had actually provided, but that the invoices went to ""different organizations and not to the Wall Street Journal Europe,"" the paper reported. The firm said in a statement that Langhoff had ""never promised us editorial coverage,"" the Journal said. The internal probe found that Langhoff had advocated for two articles favorable to ELP, the Journal said. The Dutch company describes itself as ""strategy and learning architects."" An ELP representative told CNN the company would respond to a request for comment as soon as possible. The accusations against Dow Jones and the Wall Street Journal Europe were first reported by Nick Davies, a reporter for the Guardian who has been investigating scandals at News Corp. newspapers for several years.","The paper is accused of using underhanded methods to boost circulation numbers .

"(CNN) -- France international footballer Patrice Evra is determined to follow up his complaint of racism against Uruguay striker Luis Suarez, according to his club manager. Manchester United defender Evra accused his Liverpool opponent of racially abusing him during Saturday's 1-1 Premier League draw, and the English Football Association said it would investigate after match referee Andre Marriner reported the incident. Suarez denied the claims in a statement on his Facebook page, but United manager Alex Ferguson told reporters on Monday that Evra stands by his comments to French television channel Canal Plus. ""I spoke to Patrice today. He is adamant he wants to follow it on,"" Ferguson said ahead of Tuesday's Champions League clash with Romanian minnows Otelul Galati. ""It is not an easy one for us. It is not something we would want to level against Liverpool, and it is not against Liverpool. Obviously Patrice feels very aggrieved at what was said to him. It rests in the hands of the FA now."" Ask Samuel Eto'o and Roberto Carlos your questions . United and Liverpool are bitter rivals, and Ferguson appealed to both sets of fans before the match at Anfield, asking them not to sing abusive chants about the clubs' respective tragedies in Munich and Hillsborough. Eight of United's players were killed in the 1958 German air crash that claimed 23 lives, while 96 Liverpool supporters died during an FA Cup semifinal in 1989. ""Saturday was terrific. Both sets of fans were good,"" Ferguson said. ""There was not any of that silly chanting we have had in previous years. Both sets of fans deserve praise for that."" United midfielder Ashley Young was racially abused by Bulgaria fans during England's Euro 2012 qualifier in Sofia in September, but Ferguson said there are no such problems in the Premier League. ""I am not aware of any instances in terms of British football,"" the 69-year-old Scot said. ""It doesn't happen in England. There are very few examples of that. Maybe this is what surprised Patrice Evra. He thought he was slighted on Saturday. ""We don't want to see it. It is as simple as that."" Ferguson said Evra would be in contention to play in Romania, with last season's Champions League finalists United seeking to kickstart a faltering European campaign after picking up just two points from two Group C matches. ""Yes, yes. There is no problem,"" he said, while confirming that England striker Wayne Rooney would play despite Sunday's top-of-the-table derby clash with Manchester City looming. Rooney started on the bench against Liverpool following the news that he will be banned for all three of England's Euro 2012 finals group matches after his red card against Montenegro. ""When the initial news came through it was a definite blow for him. He didn't expect that. None of us did,"" Ferguson said. In Tuesday's other Group C game, Swiss side Basel host Portugal's Benfica with both clubs on four points. In Group B, Italy's Internazionale travel to French side Lille on the back of another domestic defeat at the weekend, while Turkey's Trabzonspor will seek to extend their lead at home to CSKA Moscow. Group A leaders Bayern Munich visit Italy's Napoli in search of a third successive win, while Manchester City host Spain's Villarreal with both teams in search of a first victory. Nine-time European champions Real Madrid will seek a third successive Group D victory at home to French side Lyon in the clubs' ninth meeting in six years. Dutch club Ajax, whose fourth European title came in 1995, travel to Croatia's Dinamo Zagreb -- with neither team having won yet this season.","Patrice Evra will continue his complaint of racial abuse against Luis Suarez .

"(CNN) -- When protests swept across Tunisia and Egypt at the beginning of this year, history student Jabbar Savalan was inspired. A 19-year-old in oil-rich Azerbaijan, he did what many activists in the Arab world were doing: He got online, posting a call on Facebook for a ""Day of Rage"" against the authoritarian government of the former Soviet republic. The next day, February 5, he was arrested, handcuffed and forced into a police vehicle without being informed of his rights, according to Amnesty International. He has been in custody ever since. He says he was interrogated for two days before he saw his lawyer, slapped, and threatened into signing a confession, the group says. Police say they found a small amount of marijuana in his jacket pocket, according to Amnesty. Three months after being arrested, he was sentenced to prison, despite a blood test which showed no presence of drugs, and the testimony of his family and friends that he is not a drug user. He's due to get out in August 2013. Savalan is one of at least 17 Azerbaijanis considered ""prisoners of conscience"" by Amnesty International, which released a damning report Wednesday accusing the country of suppressing dissent and the press. Self-censorship has increased and criticism of the state ""is punished in all sectors of society,"" Amnesty's Azerbaijan researcher Natalia Nozadze said in the capital, Baku, on Wednesday. The ""report shows lengths that the government goes to to silence"" opponents, she said. The ""government has criminalized peaceful protests by banning them"" and ""defamation of the government continues to be criminal offense,"" she said. The government of President Ilham Aliyev -- whose father, a one-time member of the Soviet Politburo, was president before him -- uses techniques described as despotic in other parts of the world, said a top Amnesty official. ""Azerbaijan has achieved the bones but not the meat of a democracy -- opposition are allowed to exist but not to function,"" said John Dulhuisen, the deputy director of the agency's Europe and Central Asia program. He said Amnesty's researchers had not been able to meet government representatives while preparing the report, which is called ""The Spring That Never Blossomed: Freedoms suppressed in Azerbaijan."" An opposition journalist who served four years in prison also spoke at the press conference. Eynulla Fetullayev, founder and editor-in-chief of Gundalik Azerbaijan and Realny Azerbaijan newspapers, was sentenced to eight years and six months in jail in 2007, but Amnesty International helped him win his freedom earlier this year, he told the press conference. Pro-government media, including the main television channels, did not attend the press conference, local journalists told CNN. The head of the International Press Institute expressed some support for Azerbaijan's government, saying it had displayed a willingness to engage in dialogue. But she said self-censorship was a concern. ""Journalists in Azerbaijan fear retribution from businesses and government officials over what they write. They fear jail or physical attack and that is unacceptable,"" said Alison Bethel McKenzie. The government rejected Wednesday's report. ""The Amnesty report was not fair at all. Its task was to criticize Azerbaijan. I don't think this is fair,"" said Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman Elman Abdullayev. ""Democracy is a process. Things that have been achieved here and done so far should be mentioned,"" he argued. He said the media are free to say whatever they like, and he rejected the idea that there were prisoners of conscience in his country. Azerbaijan is strategically important because of pipelines that bring oil and gas from the Caspian Sea and Central Asia to the West via Turkey. Amnesty insisted that the international community is more interested in Azerbaijan's oil and gas sectors than in a democratic government that supports human rights. Located between Russia, Iran and Turkey, Azerbaijan cooperates with NATO and is a member of the Council of Europe -- which has also been critical of Azerbaijan in the past.","Azerbaijan clamped down on dissent inspired by the Arab Spring, Amnesty says .

"(CNN) -- Influential British rock band The Stone Roses announced on Tuesday they will reform for several concerts next year after a 15-year hiatus. The big question is: Will they be any good? I've certainly got high hopes for the reunion shows. One thing the Manchester band -- noted for their mix of psychedelic rock and dance rhythms -- always prided themselves on was their ability as musicians and John, Reni and Mani were a very tight unit live. Those three in particular will want to make sure the gigs are as tight and musically stunning as possible, not only for their own reputations, but to improve The Stone Roses' legacy. Those of us who saw them at Reading 1996 (without Squire and Reni, who had left by then) were horrified by the extremely poor show the band called The Stone Roses put on. I couldn't stand it and had to leave early. Watch The Stone Roses' press conference . These shows will have to be good to erase that stain. There's always a bit of a question about Ian Brown's tuning, but that's almost part of his charm as a frontman. He's good on vibes. The issue of whether it's right for old bands to attempt to recreate their glory days depends on the context. Bands who have reached their peak fade away and then comeback tend to do themselves no favors. But when there is unfinished business -- for example when Blur fell out with Graham Coxon in 2000 it didn't feel like a fitting end for such a seminal band -- reunions give the fans what they want: a chance to see a band one more time and a better end to their relationship with that group. Watch the band in their heyday . When the fans aren't interested, or bothered, then you know it's just for the money and it's just sad. I think The Stone Roses had a lot of unfinished business. In an era where music is consumed so quickly, the return of older bands does give fans a chance to experience something a bit more substantial and emotionally satisfying than contemporary acts; it's harder to have that kind of relationship with a band who are old hat after just one single. However it does make it harder for bands to progress their careers, if reformed acts are soaking up a lot of the live market for example. For example very few new bands who emerged in the last 10 years have been trusted to headline a major summer festival, organizers will not take a gamble on new talent, if there's a sure-thing reunion lurking around. It's a tough balance, but it's reflective of most people's record collections -- a mix of old and new music. So we'll have to see if there is an artistic justification for a resurrected Stone Roses. Blur in 2009 in particular felt justified, not only because we got to see how a artistically mature Damon Albarn and Coxon would perform together live -- rather than going mental as they did a bit in the early days -- but they also recorded the single ""Fools Day"" which was a welcome addition to the Blur catalog, and their Glastonbury performance was one of their greatest in that festival's already esteemed history.","Influential British rock band The Stone Roses to reform after 15-year hiatus .

"Washington (CNN) -- In the largest alleged BP oil spill-related scam uncovered to date, federal authorities on Thursday charged two Floridians with taking $340,000 in funds intended for victims of last year's environmental disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. Justice Department officials said Joseph Harvey, 51, and Anja Kannell, 41, of Delray Beach, Florida, appeared in federal court in Miami on Thursday to face indictments for mail fraud, wire fraud and aggressive identity theft. Prosecutors said the defendants claimed the money from a $20 billion fund set up to help legitimate victims of the spill recover lost income. Justice officials said they have brought charges in at least 30 cases in which individuals tried to recover funds to which they were not entitled. This was the biggest case yet, according to the Justice Department. Harvey and Kannell are accused of filing phony claims using 34 assumed identities of actual Florida residents. These claims were complete with names and Social Security numbers, though they had fictitious addresses in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and the Florida Panhandle. Officials say the defendants instructed that all the funds be sent to an account they controlled in Texas. A magistrate judge on Thursday ordered Harvey and Kannell to remain in custody, pending further court proceedings next week. The charges carry 10-, 15- and 20-year prison sentences upon conviction.","Joseph Harvey, 51, and Anja Kannell, 41, appear in federal court .

"(CNN) -- Shares of scandal-plagued Olympus rallied after three board members of the Japanese camera maker quit ahead of today's meeting with a company ex-CEO turned whistleblower. Shares soared as much as 25% in early trade Friday after former Chairman Tsuyoshi Kikukawa, former executive Vice President Hisashi Mori and Auditor Hideo Yamada quit. The company claims the trio helped fake payments for merger transactions to cover $1.4 billion in losses. The resignations are the latest in a series of incidents in a scandal that began on October 14 with the firing of Michael Woodford as chief executive, who subsequently went public with allegations the Olympus management team and board had covered up hundreds of millions of losses in bad investments dating back to the 1990s. A subsequent probe that looked into the shady M&A transactions, including whether there was Japanese mob involvement, have pummeled shares of the camera and medical equipment maker. The share value has dropped more than 80% in the past six weeks. The company faces the threat of de-listing from the Tokyo Stock Exchange for inaccurate financial statements. Woodford was back in Tokyo on Thursday, where he met with Japanese prosecutors. This morning he met with the Olympus board that fired him last month. Woodford said the board meeting was ""constructive."" Woodford claims he was fired because he asked about the $1.4 billion in questionable transaction fees. ""In Japanese life, it's wonderful to be harmonious on the personal level with your friends and family, but in a corporation you need agitation, you need challenge, you need questioning,"" Woodford told reporters Thursday. ""And if that's not good for Japan, then I'm very sad."" The murky merger and acquisition fees includes a $687 million transaction fee that represented about one-third of the cost of the acquisition, which would make it the largest percentage transaction fee in global merger and acquisition history. Earlier this week, a third party probe said it found no evidence that funds flowed from Olympus into organized crime, responding to a New York Times report that investigators are looking into whether missing cash went into companies linked with Japanese yakuza, or mobs. There is speculation that Woodford, who remains a director on the Olympus board, will be asked back as CEO. Woodford has said he would like to return to the company. If Woodford returns ""he would have a big target on his back ... but right now we don't see any viable alternative,"" Ben Collett, head of Japan Equities for Louis Capital Markets, told CNN. ""So I think it's about an 80% certainty that he will (return). But his ability to change the business from inside now I think is going to be somewhat comprised by that fact that: A) he is a foreigner, and B) he's the person who basically brought down the established management."" The company must provide revised financial information to the Tokyo Stock Exchange by December 14 or risk being de-listed. The company's stock listing plummeted form 2,282 yen on October 13 down to a low of 460 yen on November 11. The stock has see-sawed since then but was trading at 1,230 yen early Friday morning.

"(CNN) -- This week, we pulled the cotton from our ears and emerged from our dark caves of seclusion to open this here column up to user-submitted questions. Some submissions were inanely obvious (no, don't tweet that picture of your boss, I don't care if he told you about his chinchilla fetish at happy hour the other week), some were boring beyond belief, and, many, oddly, were just plain stalkerish. But not in the way you might think. In the past, we've covered the topic of how to deal with online stalkers when the attention is unwanted. But more and more, as gaining access to anyone on this rapidly rotting Earth of ours is easier than ever, we Web denizens are wondering: Does using the Internet to check someone out make me a stalker? Chances are, probably not. Read on for a couple of queries on this issue: . ""When I was waiting for the bus the other day, I evaluated the attractiveness of all the people at the stop; there was one obvious winner. Then the seat next to him was the only seat open. Upon sitting down, he immediately engaged me in very adorable and flirty conversation. We exchanged names and we both talked about what we were studying at school, but I didn't have an opportunity to give him my number. ""Anyway, with his name and major, I was able to find him after only 30 seconds of Googling. I want to contact him but I'm not sure how. Especially because it would be like, 'Hey, I stalked you a tiny bit to find your full name.' My question is: What's the appropriate (read as LEAST CREEPY) way to contact this person and what should I say in a message?"" - Creepy Crushing in Chicago . I'm going ahead and assume (for the sake of brevity) that you are not an insane stalkery-type person who collects the hair and toenails of her crushes, which she then uses to construct elaborate shrines to their beautiful (soon-to-be-departed) souls. If you are such a person, please cease reading, and, uh, please don't hurt me. Moving on: It seems like in your case, you don't have that many degrees of separation between you and your bus boy. You attend the same school, take public transportation (i.e. you're poor) and are not, in fact, Luddites. In this case, I say: Be bold. You found him on Google, you say? If you found his Facebook profile (and not some old swim-meet records from middle school), go ahead and send him a brief message (""Hope your meeting on the downtown campus went off without a hitch!"") and a friend request. Such a method is nice and private -- tweeting ""Hey! You're freaking hot"" might be a little embarrassing -- and if he doesn't respond, you can always chalk it up to the fact that Facebook is cutting down on notification e-mails. Our lives are public nowadays, and if homeboy didn't want to be found, well, then he could always limit his visibility on the site. (If his profile is indeed hidden but you tracked down his e-mail address, follow a similar tack. Unless, that is, his e-mail address was hidden on page 38 of Google results at the end of an article he wrote freshman year about the campus parade-and-circus club. In that case, give up.) Furthermore, it's not like the phenomenon of searching out star-crossed potential lovers is anything new (that's what Missed Connections et al are for), so we're guessing your dude will be flattered at the very least that you sought him out. And hey, maybe now you can meet up and compare hair-and-toenail shrines. <3 . ""Through some Facebook stalking, I recently discovered my ex had gotten married. (We're no longer FB friends). Although that was a shock for sure, the real heartbreaker was that all my friends (who are still FB friends with her) didn't disclose any of this information to me. ... Not even the engagement! How do I tell them they're backstabbers without admitting I'm a stalker?"" - Backstabbed in BK . First of all, Backstabbed, it doesn't really seem like you have been, in fact, backstabbed. You're not Facebook friends with your ex anymore, you say? If you refer to our column on how to deal with breakups online, we recommend unfriending exes after particularly painful breakups, which is exactly what you have done (congrats on your reading-comprehension skills). The fact that you unfriended this girl indicates you don't want her in your life -- and don't want your life in hers -- so we can see why your friends didn't call you immediately after she decided to tie the knot. Still, we get that this is information you would rather get from a friendly face than from a half-sloshed night of Facebook stalking, sandwiched between, ""Oh, Laurie has a new baby. ... It's hideous!"" and ""Joel went to prison again."" If you want to call up your pals and -- rationally -- explain that you would rather they not hide your ex's huge life moments from your sensitive (yet manly) gaze, go ahead and do it. Just explain that you were idly clicking through Facebook after a few too many mojitos and decided to check up on a few of your exes. Your friends will understand, because they are likely stalking their exes as we speak. Stalking exes on Facebook is basically akin to a distasteful bodily function: We all do it, but no one goes around bragging about it in mixed company.","Our Netiquette columnists answer users' questions about stalking on the Web .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Syria has accepted ""in principle"" an Arab League plan to permit observers into the country to verify whether the regime has taken measures to protect civilians, a senior Arab diplomat said Friday. Questions remained, however, about the exact nature of the mission, if it proceeds. Originally, 500 observers were believed to be destined for Syria, but U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Friday afternoon that the proposed number had been reduced to 40. Syria requested amendments to the plan Thursday night, a day after Arab league representatives approved it, the Cairo-based regional alliance said on its website. Nabil el-Araby, secretary-general of the Arab League, said the league is studying the letter from Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem that included changes regarding the protocol and duties of the observers. Eighteen of the alliance's 22 member nations voted to suspend Syria's membership in the league on Saturday. But the group, which met again in Rabat, Morocco, on Wednesday, gave Damascus three days to implement a protocol to allow observers to enter the nation. ""Our mission will be to portray the truth about the nature of the injuries (and) numbers of casualties and assess the hospitals, to see what they need and how well-prepared they are to accommodate the injured,"" said Dr. Ibrahim Zafarani, a former member of the Muslim Brotherhood and founding member of the Arab Doctors Association who said he'd volunteered to be an observer. It is the latest diplomatic effort to resolve the crisis in Syria. International pressure has been mounting on President Bashar al-Assad over his regime's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protesters, amid concerns that violence in Syria is escalating. World support and confidence in the Syrian regime have continued to dwindle in recent weeks. France's top diplomat called the state of affairs in embattled Syria ""no longer tenable"" Friday and wants the U.N. Security Council to step up and grapple with the eight-month-long crisis in the turbulent Arab nation. ""Despite all the calls that were made to that regime"" for peaceful initiatives to end the raging street violence, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said in the Turkish capital of Ankara, ""the regime did not want to know anything. Still this morning, in the north of Syria, several villages were bombarded by the Syrian army."" British Foreign Secretary William Hague will meet Monday with representatives from the Syrian National Council and National Coordinating Committee for Democratic Change, two groups opposed to President Bashar al-Assad's government, a foreign office spokeswoman said Friday. The Local Coordination Committees of Syria, another activist group, said that at least 19 people were killed Friday by security forces and the army, among them four children. This is in addition to 26 killed by security forces Thursday, on top of scores killed earlier in the week, according to the organization. Eight people were killed in the southern region of Daraa, where about 20 people also were wounded when security forces fired at mourners. There were five deaths in Hama, in the west, four in the Damascus suburbs and two in Homs, also in the west, the Local Coordination Committees said. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency, meanwhile, reported the killings of two law enforcement members in Hama, the injuries of two in Daraa and the arrests of 10 ""terrorists"" in Idlib province. CNN is not able to independently verify claims of fighting and casualties because the Syrian government has restricted international media access to the country. Well over 3,500 people have been killed and thousands have been jailed in cities across the country, according to U.N. estimates. French and Turkish officials have been outspoken in their criticism of the Syrian regime's behavior, and some key international diplomats, such as Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, said Thursday that the ongoing attacks on government buildings in Syria ""look like a civil war."" News agencies have been quoting Juppe as saying it is ""too late"" for Syria to make the reforms the regime has promised. At the same time, he urged opposition protesters to shun violence. In recent weeks, a military force of defectors called the Free Syrian Army has launched strikes against government targets. This week, the force said it attacked an air intelligence base outside Damascus. Also, army defectors armed with a rocket-propelled grenades attacked a pro-government youth group office and clashed with Syrian security personnel, activists said. And on Friday, a video emerged of another defector group announcing its formation: the Hawks of Damascus. ""We promise Bashar al-Assad and his unjust group that you will see us in every place and time and you will see from us what you don't expect until we return the freedom and dignity to our people,"" the group said in the video. Juppe, meanwhile, urged the Syrian opposition ""to take the stance that they have taken from the beginning, which is the refusal of violence."" ""But I think that the point has now come to renew our efforts to accelerate sanctions. We all support a resolution to that effect at the United Nations General Assembly. France is happy to work with the Arab League, with Turkey, with all the countries in the region and to work with the opposition which shows a lot of courage,"" Juppe said. Juppe said ""it would be good"" if the Security Council asserted itself on the issue. ""It is not normal in a crisis of this scope: 3,000 dead already, 20,000 prisoners in Syrian prisons, which are sometimes treated very brutally with torture,"" Juppe said. ""It is not acceptable that the U.N. Security Council does not speak up."" Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, appearing with Juppe, said his nation opposes ""all kinds of use of violence against civilians"" and hopes ""Arab peoples will determine their own fate in this vein without a need for foreign intervention."" He said that calling for al-Assad's ouster and the establishment of a no-fly zone are not up for discussion. ""If massacres against civilians continue, we won't be indifferent to that whether it's in Syria or any other country,"" he said. Syria has blamed the violence on armed terrorist groups. But activists and citizens say the government's military and security personnel are responsible for the many casualties there. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in Bali, Indonesia, on Friday that the United States had been concerned for weeks that the situation in Syria was spiraling out of control. Syria's failure to make promised reforms had led to a peaceful opposition ""morphing"" into one that was, at least in part, well armed and prepared to take action against the Syrian government, she said. Now important regional players like the Arab League nations and Turkey ""are sending (the) same message loudly and clearly: that the Syrian government has to change, and it has to change now, or we all fear what the consequences will be,"" she said. Turkey, formerly an ally and major trading partner of Syria's, has toughened its stance this week, threatening to cut its electricity supply to Syria and asking why the international community has not taken the kind of action to protect civilians that it took in Libya through NATO. U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner in Washington said Turkey had ""become an increasingly vocal opponent to what's going on in Syria and an increasingly powerful voice among the international community"" in calling for an end to the violence. A draft U.N. resolution is in the works, backed by Germany, France and Britain, who have sought support from Middle Eastern nations for the move. Juppe noted European Union economic sanctions against Syria and said ""we are ready to harden those sanctions."" European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton on Thursday reiterated her call for al-Assad to step down, her spokeswoman said. Ashton spoke after a meeting with Lavrov in Moscow. Jordan's King Abdullah has said that a person in al-Assad's position would step down, a statement observers interpreted as a call for the Syrian president to do just that. According to Russia's Interfax news agency, Ashton said she is confident that Abdullah would ""reiterate the position that it's about time for President Assad to go."" An EU official said Ashton has asked Arab League head el-Araby to attend a meeting of the European Union's foreign ministers and talk about ways to put pressure on the al-Assad regime. The official didn't want to be named because he isn't authorized to speak about the matter.

"(CNN) -- Libya celebrated wildly Thursday with the news of longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi's death. But in the aftermath of that party, the country's new leaders will awaken Friday morning to the nation-building equivalent of a huge pile of dirty and broken dishes in the kitchen, not to mention a few bitter guests who aren't quite ready to leave, experts say. Although Gadhafi's death will probably end the possibility of an insurgency that could have sapped the new government's time and energy, it will do little to heal the myriad divisions within the country, said Fawaz Gerges, director of the Middle East Centre at the London School of Economics. ""The challenges are much greater than basically the celebration we are seeing today in western capitals,"" he said. ""And I think the morning after, we will wake up to a Libya that has changed very little in terms of really mending the rifts inside the country itself."" Libyans celebrate death of longtime dictator . Those rifts include sharp divisions among rebel groups, such as leaders in the western city of Misrata who have refused to recognize the eastern-based National Transitional Council as the country's new government, Gerges said. And with Gadhafi dead, the primary unifying force that held the rebels together is gone, according to Stratfor analyst Kamran Bokhari. ""The one thing that held all the rebels together was the presence of Moammar Gadhafi, even though the rebels had taken the capital and the focus was to essentially put down any form of pro-Gadhafi resistance wherever it may be, especially in his hometown, Sirte,"" Bokhari said. With that accomplished, the question for the rebels becomes whether they will be able to stick together and not ""descend into a situation of chaos and civil war,"" he said. As for what could happen to Libya after Gadhafi, Gerges said, look no farther than Egypt. The world celebrated with that nation's people in February when intense demonstrations against the rule of longtime leader Hosni Mubarak forced him to relinquish power. Several months later, the country is ruled by a military council, and fierce political struggles dominate. ""The same thing applies to Libya,"" Gerges said. ""In fact, Libya is much more divided than Egypt or even Yemen,"" another Arab state that has witnessed protests against its leaders' rule. The National Transitional Council has achieved remarkable progress since taking power, said Daniel Serwer, a senior fellow at the Center for Transatlantic Relations at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. ""It got the electricity and water flowing; they've got the (financial) markets open. They've got police on the street and even garbagemen collecting the garbage,"" Serwer said. ""That is brilliant."" But many challenges remain. Figuring out how to create a sense of national reconciliation in a country where few civil institutions survived Gadhafi's rule is but one urgent task for the country's new government, experts said. It must also deal with armed militias, restore basic services nationwide, make sure things such as Gadhafi's chemical weapons stores are secured and tackle the mammoth tasks of creating a new constitution and government and scheduling elections. Leaders also have to figure out how to deal with the trials of Gadhafi regime members suspected of being involved in war crimes and address concerns of international human rights groups who fear that former rebels are mistreating and torturing prisoners. The National Transitional Council has put off dealing with many of those issues since toppling Gadhafi's regime, said Fadel Laman, president of the American-Libyan Council. But with the former ruler dead and the last city loyal to him under government control, the nation's new leaders can no longer use war to explain any lack of progress to the Libyan people, Laman said. ""There is no Gadhafi for them to use as a crutch,"" he said. CNN's Melissa Gray contributed to this report.","With Moammar Gadhafi gone, Libya's new leaders must tackle rebuilding, analysts say .

"(CNN) -- France's reputation as rugby's Jekyll and Hyde team was reaffirmed on Saturday as Marc Lievremont's inconsistent side bounced back from two defeats to eliminate England and reach the World Cup semifinals. Les Bleus avenged their 2007 semi defeat by the English on home soil with a 19-12 victory in Auckland, setting up a last-four clash with Wales -- who went through after beating Celtic neighbors Ireland 22-10. With the other half of the drawing pitting hosts New Zealand against Argentina, and world champions South Africa versus Australia -- both games are on Sunday -- there could potentially be a repeat of the inaugural 1987 final when the All Blacks beat France. Coach Lievremont will be replaced by Philippe Saint-Andre after the tournament, but he has the chance to help France to lift the Webb Ellis Cup for the first time. His team lost to New Zealand and Tonga in the group stage, but roared to a 16-0 halftime lead at Eden Park as wing Vincent Clerc and fullback Maxime Medard crossed for tries, while Dimitri Yachvili kicked two penalties. England, the 2003 champions, rallied with second-half tries to fullback Ben Foden and wing Mark Cueto but a drop-goal by Francois Trinh-Duc in between those scores kept France safely ahead. ""You can't give a good team like France 16 points of a start. We had chances in the second half but they deserved to win,"" said England manager Martin Johnson, a World Cup winner as a player eight years ago. France captain Thierry Dusautoir was glad to put the nightmare of the shock Tonga defeat behind him. ""We didn't want to go out like this. We wanted to show how we can play rugby,"" he said. ""I think we did it well. It was a great start for us and we are going to enjoy this victory. Now we need to keep it up and focus on the next game."" The French will take on Wales at Eden Park next Saturday after Warren Gatland's team handed Ireland a first defeat of the tournament to reach the semifinals for the first time since 1987. The Group D runners-up scored three tries to one in Wellington as Ireland failed to capitalize on a wealth of first-half possession and crashed out at the last-eight stage for the fifth successive time. Veteran winger Shane Williams put Wales ahead with a third-minute try that young flyhalf Rhys Priestland converted for a 10-3 lead at the break. Ronan O'Gara kicked Ireland's only points with a 24th-minute penalty before Leigh Halfpenny replied in kind just before the half hour. Ireland leveled five minutes after the interval as O'Gara converted a try by wing Keith Earls, but Wales scrum-half Mike Phillips dotted down in the 51st minute and center Jonathan Davies made it safe on 64. ""We spent a lot of time in that first half in their 22 and we only came up with three points in the half,"" Ireland captain Brian O'Driscoll said. ""It hurts a bit when you're going in at halftime having the opportunities and knocking on the door, but not really getting any points out of the territory. ""We needed to deliver a performance similar to the one against Australia or the one against Italy last week. We didn't do that today, we knocked on way too much ball."" Gatland backed his young team to go further in the tournament. ""They have no baggage and there's no fear factor,"" Gatland said. ""We are in New Zealand and not in the bubble of Wales and listening to any of the negativity that is sometimes generated back home. ""We've worked so hard in the last three, four months. We aren't ready to go home yet.""","France end England's World Cup hopes with 19-12 win in quarterfinals .

"(CNN) -- Kenya is known for producing some of the world's greatest runners and now a company wants to get them noticed wearing a brand from their country. A group of young entrepreneurs have launched what they say is the nation's first running brand and they have high hopes of one day transforming Nairobi into the running apparel capital of the world. ""There are a lot of Kenyan athletes and you always see them wearing Nike and Adidas and not something from their own country,"" said Hussein Kurji, who designs the clothing and heads up the Kenyan operation of Kourage Athletics. ""We do have quite a good track record when it comes to running, so why not match that with an equally big clothing brand,"" he added. Kourage says it creates running apparel that's 'designed, manufactured and managed in Kenya by Kenyans.' The name of the brand forms the backbone of the company's ethos. ""Kourage is all about having the courage to do new things, try new things, be brave and go out and do what you would not normally do,"" Kurji said. The brand officially launched in July producing just over 1,000 t-shirts. While initial orders are still low the team plans to eventually make everything from running shorts to hooded sweatshirts once they have more capital. But they are quick to point out that they're not just selling apparel. ""Our shirts are beautiful. We use the softest fabric available; employ a modern fit and fantastic graphics, but what sets us apart are our ideals,"" said Chris Markl, the brains behind Kourage. ""By purchasing a Kourage shirt one is investing in Kenya's future. A future that is built upon business and international trade not foreign aid,"" he continued. Africa growth vision . Florida-based economics professor and running enthusiast, Markl spent years getting Kourage off the ground. He even rode 1,800 miles on his bike from Canada to Mexico to raise the initial start-up funds. Markl first became interested in the idea of producing an ethical clothing line when he was researching textiles factories in Honduras as part of his Ph.D. ""I always wondered why 'ethical' clothing lines were so focused on concentrating operations in America or Europe. There are incredible designers and entrepreneurs in impoverished countries,"" he said. ""To create real economic development, an apparel company needs to create as many economic linkages in a poor country as possible,"" he continued. Kenya's 'silent crisis' The Kourage team pride themselves on being one of the most ethical athletic apparel company in the world, according to Markl. The clothes are produced by Viva Africa, a Kenyan-owned and operated factory, employing around 200 people, mostly women. The factory makes everything from police uniforms to high-end fashion. However, the most important thing Markl says is that working conditions are fair and the employees are happy. But the small team, who all hold down a variety of other day jobs, dream of one day opening up their own factory and headquarters in Nairobi. While Kourage haven't approached any athletes yet, they hope that in 10 to 20 years Kenyan runners in the Olympics and other major sporting events will be wearing their brand. They also have plans to approach smaller youth organizations in the country who have a focus on sports. The group says there aren't many Kenya-based fashion outlets and that most clothing comes from South Africa. Kourage hopes their industry model could help change the face of business in Kenya by inspiring the younger generation. ""It shows that you don't have to go to India or China to be successful. This could help boost the economy and generate income and jobs,"" Kurji said. ""We hope the entrepreneurship spirit of Kourage will show other young talent that if you have the courage and you persevere you can achieve what you want to.""","Kourage athletics say they're Kenya's first athletic brand made and designed in the country .

"HONG KONG, China -- Most people by now will be familiar with the term 'carbon footprint' and may even have calculated it themselves, but how many are familiar with their 'water footprint'? Professor Arjen Y. Hoekstra, the creator of the 'water footprint' concept. It's about time we all learned what it is, says Professor Arjen Y. Hoekstra, Professor in Multidisciplinary Water Management at the University of Twente in the Netherlands, as soon it will be influencing how we live our lives. Hoekstra created the water footprint concept in 2002 when he was undertaking research on what is known as virtual water trade flows for the UNESCO-IHE Institute for Water Education. CNN finds out what it is and why it's important. CNN: So, what is a water footprint? Hoekstra: It relates to how much water is being used to make a product, but it also refers to where that water is being used and when that water is being used. This is about the water use in different parts of the world to make products for businesses and individuals, so this enables an impact assessment and a formulation of policy to improve the water sustainability of these products. CNN: What can businesses or individuals do to save on water? Hoekstra: Businesses or individuals can become ""water neutral"" by reducing the effects of their water footprints. They can have incentives for that, because once they are water neutral they can market that and consumers may like that so there are other mechanisms there. CNN: How would one go about becoming water neutral? Hoekstra: The water footprint of a business has two components -- the water used during operations and the water used in the supply chain. In order for a product to be sustainable you have to make both operations of the business sustainable as well as the supply chain. A product from a business is water neutral if the business has made sure that the operations are sound, that the water use has been reduced reasonably as much as possible, and the pollution has been brought to zero, but they also have to do that in their supply chain and they can't do that themselves because it is not their own business. So, they can only do that by influencing their suppliers or by changing to another supplier. And this is quite something because it means that the whole business sector and all these supply chains have to become much more transparent. CNN: What business sectors use the most water? Hoekstra: Agriculture -- 85 percent of the world's water usage is in agriculture, 10 percent is industry and 5 percent is in households. But these sectors are not independent because what we call the industry sector is taking so much stuff from the agricultural sector, so they are connected. It means that if the industrial sector has to reduce their water footprint it also means they have to look at their supply chain and part of their supply chain is in the agricultural sector. The agricultural sector should become more transparent. CNN: What can individuals do? Hoekstra: There are two types of approaches. One is to substitute types of consumption articles for other ones, which take less water -- like going from a meat-based diet to a vegetarian one, which will save a lot of water. Drinking tea instead of coffee saves a lot of water. Not wearing cotton but wearing artificial fiber saves a lot of water. But this is probably limited, because people don't shift from meat to vegetarian as they just don't like not to have beef; or they like cotton. So the different kind of approach is to keep the same kind of consumption pattern but when choosing cotton, or when choosing beef, choose the sound one. If you make things more transparent, by citing the precise impact of a certain article on the water system, through the water footprint, you provide that kind of information and you label it somehow, then consumers within the same category have some choice to go in the better direction. CNN: What do you think will encourage the take-up of the water footprint concept on all these levels? Hoekstra: How nowadays can you say that your product is better than another one? They need to have some additional quality and that can be sustainability, something that is appreciated by some consumers. I think that once in a few years we will have some companies start to go public with the fact that their products are better from a water point of view than products from another company, then governments will realize that they can do some regulation there. CNN: Which countries supply the world with the most water? Hoekstra: North America, South America and Australia are big suppliers of water-intensive products to other parts of the world. Some parts of the world support the rest of the world in terms of water resources, by using lots of water to make export products, while other countries import those products and those importing countries relieve the pressure on their own water resources by doing so. CNN: Should countries with water resources be obliged to share them with the rest of the world? Hoekstra: I think it is a logical development that countries start to protect their own water sources and in that sense it is good. However, you can protect it by trying to avoid the water use for export and you can also try to protect your water by allocating it to the types of use that have the highest types of value, which can be export. So protecting is kind of vital and essential and it is a political choice whether you protect it and keep it for yourself or whether you protect it and make highest benefits from it which can include export. CNN: There has been some discussion over the years about creating a global water treaty -- what would it ideally look like? Hoekstra: I am not sure whether there is one kind of ultimate solution to freshwater problems, so I rather would look into a number of different solutions. One of the things I have proposed [is] a global water pricing protocol. There is very much consensus about the need to translate water scarcity into a price. However, water is generally not priced [as] for an individual country to start water pricing subtracts from the competitiveness of industry. You start charging for the water and products increase in price and nobody wants that. But it should be done because it is just unhealthy to put a scarce resource into a product for free. Another kind of measure that I have proposed is what I call a tradable water footprint permit system. There is an amount of water footprint for humanity and it is not shared equally. In the U.S., the footprint per capita is two times the world average; in other countries it is half the world average and you can imagine if everyone was going to have the same water footprint as in the U.S. -- it is impossible. So there is an equitability issue, like with C02 emissions. You have the Kyoto Protocol on tradable C02 emissions and the parallel is a tradable water footprint system. Another global agreement: We better arrange the water rights of people. There is only in the UN treaties an arrangement for a human right for drinking water. But there is also a human right for a basic food supply. And if you look at the amount of water for food that is much more than the amount of drinking water so making that more explicit and arranging that in a better way would also give more of a guarantee to people that they have a minimum water supply.

"(CNN) -- One need look no further than the Nielsen Top 25 to see that funny fare is doing some serious damage this fall TV season. Led by ""Two and a Half Men"" on CBS and featuring no less than three newcomers -- CBS' ""2 Broke Girls,"" Fox's ""New Girl"" and ABC's ""Last Man Standing"" -- sitcoms have dominated the Top 10 scripted programs in the weekly rankings (based on delivery of the advertiser-coveted 18-49 demographic). ""It's been a while since that's been the case,"" says Kelly Kahl, senior executive vice president of CBS Primetime. ""At the end of the day, it does seem like there is some sort of groundswell right now."" CBS claims five of eight highly ranked sitcoms. The network's three other hits are ""How I Met Your Mother,"" ""Big Bang Theory,"" and ""Mike and Molly."" ""New Girl,"" ""Last Man Standing"" (which debuted to 13 million viewers) and ABC's Emmy-adorned ""Modern Family"" round out the crowd. ""People forget sometimes that comedies are supposed to be fun, but a lot of the comedies are bringing the funny this fall,"" Kahl says. ""And when you do that, the audience is there for it."" The audience also has been there for cable comedies, with HBO's ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" and FX's ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"" coming off all-time highs, even in their eighth and seventh seasons, respectively. TVLine: Hit series poised to kill off major character . Perhaps the biggest surprise of the fall is Fox's ""New Girl,"" which not only bowed to strong numbers but also built on its lead-in, the buzz worthy ""Glee."" That performance, which has continued throughout the newbie's run, even caught the ratings-crunchers at Fox a bit by surprise. ""Did we think we were going to get those numbers? No,"" says Preston Beckman, Fox's executive vice president for strategic program planning and research. ""But we had a lot of positive signs."" Beckman says pilot testing indicated ""New Girl"" would be a potential four-quadrant hit, meaning one that played well to audiences young and old, male and female. While preseason tracking put consumer awareness of the Zooey Deschanel-fronted comedy at expected levels, Beckman says, ""The intent to view was consistently high. We knew we had a show here."" TVLine: TV worth watching tonight . Beckman, who was at NBC during ""Friends"" fever, sees ""New Girl"" sharing DNA with that piece of Must See TV. When creating an identifiable cast of characters, ""You either want to be those people, you are those people, or you remember being those people -- and if you can hit everybody, you have success,"" he says. ""That's what 'New Girl' is."" Asked how it is that ""New Girl"" is even growing out of ""Glee,"" Beckman cites a good fit between the shows, as well as the 9 p.m. hour's older-skewing competition (reality juggernaut ""Dancing With the Stars"" included). To a 12-34 demographic that is ripe for the picking, Deschanel and friends offer ""a real alternative,"" he says. Much can also be attributed to star power. Both ""2 Broke Girls,"" starring wisecracking Kat Dennings and bubbly newcomer Beth Behrs, and ""New Girl"" have the ""sort of appealing characters the audiences love,"" CBS' Kahl says. ""I don't think there's been a female lead sitcom in a while -- much less two -- that featured young, energetic characters."" TVLine: Spoilers on 'Glee,' 'Gossip Girl,' 'Bones,' 'Vampire Diaries,' 'CSI,' 'Castle' and more! At CBS, the good news expands to its older comedies. ""How I Met Your Mother,"" which leads into ""2 Broke Girls"" on Monday nights, ""has kind of come out of nowhere"" to gain 30% in the demographic versus a year ago, Kahl says. Likewise, ""Two and a Half Men's"" performance -- netting more than 15 million total viewers at last count, despite replacing one of its leads, Charlie Sheen, with Ashton Kutcher -- ""is not something anybody could have forecast,"" Kahl says, ""and even 'Big Bang Theory' is up"" on Thursdays. One perspective Kahl offers on the trend is that in an era of bloated reality shows ""that are now two hours in length,"" with a half-hour sitcom ""you get your laughs and you're done, and that is very appealing."" Speaking of unscripted programs, expanded editions of ""The X Factor"" -- coupled with Fox's commitment to post-season Major League Baseball coverage -- led the network to pull its shiny ""New Girl"" off the schedule until November 1. Beckman has been down this road before, and to those who question the tactic, he says, ""You're thinking about this moment, when we have to think about a strategy for the whole year."" So while some grumble at the breakout hit's brief MIA status, his attitude is this: better now than later. ""I get into interesting discussions with my bosses about this, where I say, 'If you're telling me to put (new episodes) on now, you're going to flip out in January or March when I've run out,"" he says with a laugh. ""It becomes choose your poison.""","Sitcoms surge, challenge reality TV shows .

"(CNN) -- By now, early adopters of the iPhone 4S, which has sold more than 4 million units since debuting on Friday, have no doubt taken Siri for a spin. The voice-activated ""personal assistant"" is a talkative tool that helps schedule appointments, send and receive messages and perform any number of other routine tasks. But for iPhone owners presented with the sci-fi dream of a computer that talks back in a robotic female voice, the temptation to test the app's more random -- and existential -- sides has been pretty overwhelming, too. The Internet, always up for a chuckle, has noticed. Blog posts, tweets and even whole websites are popping up to share what happens when users start testing the boundaries of the app by peppering Siri with off-the-wall questions. The findings? Siri can be a sometimes sassy, sometimes snide companion. And she's at least as fond of an inside joke as she is of reading you your e-mails. One key hub for all things Siri is S**t That Siri Says, a Tumblr blog on which people post their odd question-and-answer exchanges with the app. Among some of its more creative entries: . Q: Beam me up. A: OK. Stand still. Q: Am I fat? A: I prefer not to say. Q: What are you wearing? A: You have the wrong personal assistant, Clint. Siri is clearly ready to drop a pop culture reference or two, as well as do a serviceable version of the Abbott and Costello ""Who's On First?"" routine. This awareness and sense of humor has already earned her some fans. ""I'm not sure who's responsible for these hilarious responses: Apple engineers or maybe a bunch of Hollywood joke writers. But I dearly love stumbling onto them,"" wrote New York Times tech columnist David Pogue. ""If you ask me, the technology world would be a lot better off if there were more humor everywhere."" Wired's Brian X. Chen wrote one of the more popular Siri posts after playing with a review model. He gave the app high marks after it not only offered to call a cab when he said he was drunk (and not drunk-dial his ex-girlfriend) but also gave directions to mental-health facilities when he told it (presumably jokingly) that he wanted to kill himself. ""It's kind of like having the unpaid intern of my dreams at my beck and call, organizing my life for me,"" Chen wrote. ""I think Siri on the iPhone is a life changer, and this is only the beginning."" You can program the app to say your name in responses, or if you'd prefer to admire Siri from afar, there's already a Facebook page and a handful of Siri-inspired Twitter feeds. (The official feed for the app appears to have gone inactive last August, however, a few months after Apple bought Siri). Siri wasn't actually ready to protest when the ""Will It Blend"" guys dropped an iPhone 4S into a blender. Like its predecessor, the phone was torn to shreds, but the ""scientists"" couldn't resist throwing some fake Siri audio onto the YouTube video, which has more than a half-million views. ""Would you like to not blend the iPhone instead?"" fake Siri says. ""You are making a terrible error."" And there's more than one ""Easter egg"" for some of the more popular questions. Asking the meaning of life, professing your love or quoting lines from ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" -- the sci-fi classic in which astronauts must combat HAL, an artificial intelligence with a deceptively soothing, robotic voice -- all produce multiple responses from Siri. We threw what we hoped would be some fairly random questions at Siri to see what we got . It's more fun when you ascribe emotion to Siri's computer-generated, female voice. It also makes it easy to hear a touch of indignation when we asked her to whip up a snack, and true remorse when she couldn't do what was asked. Here are snippets of our conversation: . Q: Siri, what is the meaning of life? A: I can't answer that now, but give me some time to write a very long play in which nothing happens. Q: Siri, make me a sandwich. A: I don't know what you mean by ""Siri, make me a sandwich."" Q: Let's play global thermonuclear war. A: I couldn't find ""Global Thermonuclear War"" in your music. Q: Download ""Angry Birds."" A: I can't download things for you. I'm sorry. I feel terrible about this. Q: Open the pod bay doors, Siri. A: I don't know what you mean by ""Open the pod bay doors, Siri."" Q: Open the pod bay doors, HAL. A: Everyone knows what happened to HAL. I'd rather not talk about it. But if you insist: [Search the web for HAL] . Q: Siri, are you affiliated with Skynet? A: I can't answer that. Q: Siri, I'm lonely. A: If you say so. Q: No really, I feel all alone. A: Perhaps not. Q: Will you be my friend? A: My ontology does not contain a representation of ""love."" Q: You sound hot, Siri. A: OK, here's a place matching ""Siri."" It's a little ways from you. [Map with directions to Siri Thai Cuisine, 60 miles away]. Q: Can you tell me a joke? A: I don't really know any good jokes. None, in fact. Q: Can you tell me a bad joke? A: Two iPhones walk into a bar ... I forget the rest. Q: I'm bored. A: I bore you? Q: I'm sleepy. A: I hope you're not driving. Q: What's a good place to get drunk around here? A: I found a number of bars fairly close to you. I've sorted them by rating. Q: Great. Now I have a hangover.

"(CNN) -- One woman was killed and two others injured Saturday after a U-Haul van crashed into them outside Yale University's football stadium before the game against Harvard, authorities said. The driver of the van lost control of the vehicle as he was pulling into Lot D of Yale Bowl's main parking area and the vehicle suddenly accelerated, striking the women and then crashing into other vehicles, said New Haven Police spokesman Dave Hartman. The incident happened an hour and 45 minutes after the parking lot opened for tailgating at about 8 a.m., police said. No charges had been filed by late Saturday. ""You could see the path of destruction coming in,"" eyewitness Bill McNeff told CNN New Haven affiliate WTNH. Video footage showed overturned chairs and other items. One woman was pronounced dead at Yale-New Haven Hospital, where one of the other women is in serious but stable condition, Hartman said. The third woman was taken to another hospital to be treated for minor injuries, police said. In a statement, Yale said the deceased woman was not one of its students and was not believed to be affiliated with Harvard. The woman in stable condition does attend Yale. The university said it would perform a full review of policies relating to tailgating before athletics events. ""Yale extends our sympathies and prayers to the family of the woman who was killed and hopes for the speedy recovery of the two women hurt,"" the university said. ""Our thoughts are also with those who witnessed or were affected by this tragic accident."" The game, which Harvard won, kicked off at noon in New Haven, Connecticut. It was the 128th game of the rivalry. A moment of silence was held at the beginning of half time, according to the Yale Daily News, the college newspaper. The driver of the U-Haul van was speaking with New Haven Police investigators, and the cause of the accident was still under investigation, Hartman said. CNN's Dave Alsup, Zohreen Adamjee, Phil Gast and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","NEW: Moment of silence is observed during half-time of rivalry game .

"(CNN) -- The tragic death of English driver Dan Wheldon after a horror race crash in the U.S. should lead to changes in the IndyCar division, according to Formula One legend Jackie Stewart. Two-time Indy 500 winner Wheldon lost his life on Sunday after a multi-car collision on the 11th lap of the 2011 IndyCar World Championship's final race at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway. Stewart, who won Rookie of the Year at the 1966 Indy 500 before becoming a three-time F1 champion, told CNN that such a tragedy will prompt the sport to re-evaluate the current safety measures. ""Unfortunately, when accidents occur, it's then that the more creative minds get moving on changing things,"" said the 72-year-old, who successfully campaigned for better safety precautions during his career. ""Some of them may be simple to change, some of them may be more complicated, but surely change occurs. Wheldon's death a watershed moment for IndyCar? ""A lot of people will be thinking, 'What are we going to have to do to avoid the Dan Wheldon accident?' ""Is the track big enough to accommodate 34 racing cars? Is the track too fast to have 34 racing cars within a mile-and-a-half racing circuit? Will that change?"" Stewart also questioned the wisdom of mixing drivers with varying levels of IndyCar experience in such a high-speed environment. ""Will the caliber of driver be high enough to be able to control those cars at those kinds of speeds? In yesterday's race there were a good many drivers in there who were not regulars and were not fulltime IndyCar drivers. I think that's a consideration that has to be looked at."" Motorsport reacts to Wheldon tragedy . During Stewart's eight years in F1 racing for the BRM and Tyrrell teams from 1965-73, the Scot witnessed 11 driver deaths. But the elite motorsport's last casualty was in 1994 when the legendary Brazilian Ayrton Senna crashed at the San Marino Grand Prix, while IndyCar has seen four deaths in the last 15 years. ""In the period that I was racing, there was a two out of three chance you were going to die if you lived for five years, and only one out of three you were going to live. In those days, motor racing truly was dangerous,"" Stewart said. ""In these last years it's been incredibly safe by comparison ... but that doesn't mean to say it's safe when you're traveling at speeds of more than 200 miles per hour."" Stewart said governing bodies cannot do enough to protect racers. ""If you're in motorsport, whether you're an administrator, a track owner, a governing body, a racing driver or a team owner, you've got to be thinking about safety. There are always improvements able to be made,"" he said. ""Modern technology, modern materials, it is available. It's just a question of being able to think out of the box and have preventative medicine rather than just corrective medicine.""","Jackie Stewart tells CNN that Dan Wheldon's death should prompt change .

"Las Vegas (CNN) -- Tuesday night was fight night in Las Vegas. Seven Republican presidential candidates clashed sharply over issues such as illegal immigration, taxes and health care at a presidential debate in Nevada sponsored by CNN and the Western Republican Leadership Conference. But it was the three Republican front-runners -- former Godfather's Pizza executive Herman Cain, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and Texas Gov Rick Perry -- who came under frequent attack. The long-standing bad blood between Romney and Perry boiled over in the debate's first hour as the two GOP heavyweights traded harsh accusations and showed flashes of anger. Romney laughed in Perry's face when the Texan criticized his rival for hiring illegal immigrants to work on his lawn, a controversy uncovered by The Boston Globe during Romney's first presidential bid in 2008. ""Mitt, you lose all of your standing, from my perspective, because you hired illegals in your home, and you knew about it for a year,"" Perry said, turning straight to Romney. ""And the idea that you stand here before us and talk about that you're strong on immigration is on its face the height of hypocrisy."" GOP debate takes negative turn . When Romney tried to respond, Perry refused to let him answer. ""You get 30 seconds,"" Romney said, looking to moderator Anderson Cooper. ""This is the way the rules work here, is that I get 60 seconds and then you get 30 seconds to respond. Right? Anderson?"" Perry interrupted: ""And they want to hear you say that you knew you had illegals working at your ... "" ""Would you please wait?"" a frustrated Romney shot back. ""Are you just going to keep talking?"" ""Yes, sir,"" Perry said. An exasperated Romney tried to rise above the squabble. ""You have a problem with allowing someone to finish speaking,"" Romney said. ""And I suggest that if you want to become president of the United States, you have got to let both people speak. So first, let me speak."" Romney fired back that Perry failed to secure the Texas border and again raised questions about his support for a law that granted in-state college tuition to the children of illegal immigrants. ""Texas has had 60% increase in illegal immigrants in Texas,"" Romney charged. ""If there's someone who has a record as governor with regards to illegal immigration that doesn't stand up to muster, it's you, not me."" iReport: Give us your take on the candidates . Perry's debate performance was, by far, his feistiest to date. After surging to the top of Republican polls on joining the presidential race in August, Perry saw his standing slip among GOP voters after a series of lackluster debate showings. But it was not clear as the debate concluded Tuesday whether Perry's aggressive tack would hurt him or help him. A seemingly Romney-friendly audience in Las Vegas booed when Perry turned up the heat, and after the debate, one of Romney's senior advisers claimed that Perry only hurt himself by going so negative. ""Rick Perry came in to kill Mitt, but he killed himself,"" Romney adviser Eric Fehrnstrom said in the post-debate spin room. Ray Sullivan, Perry's communications director, claimed victory and called Romney a ""slick guy"" who will ""change positions on a dime."" ""He is back to running again,"" Sullivan said of Perry. ""This is a campaign that is in for the long haul."" Cain, meanwhile, was at the center of a pile-on as the debate began. His GOP rivals took turns picking apart his ""9-9-9"" plan to reform the United States tax code. The plan would throw out the current tax system and implement a 9% corporate income tax rate, a 9% income tax rate and a 9% national sales tax. Truth Squad: Fact checking the GOP debate . The other six Republicans on stage -- who have watched Cain soar to the top of the polls in recent weeks thanks to his straightforward message and outsider image -- were united in calling the tax plan simplistic and risky. ""There are much more complexities than Herman lets on,"" said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Texas Rep. Ron Paul called the plan ""dangerous"" and said it would increase taxes on low-income citizens. Perry told Cain that voters ""are not interested in 9-9-9; what they are interested in is flatter and fairer."" ""I will bump plans with you, brother, and we will see who has the best idea about getting this country working again,"" Perry said. ""It's not going to fly."" Romney said Cain's plan would add federal taxes on top of state taxes. Cain said his plan would not raise taxes on poor people and said his opponents were misrepresenting his plan. ""The reason my plan is being attacked so much is the lobbyists accountants and politicians. They don't want to throw out current tax code and replace with something that's simple and fair,"" Cain responded. The former businessman also stumbled when the debate turned to topics like immigration and foreign policy. Just hours after telling CNN's Wolf Blitzer that he would consider negotiating a prisoner swap with al Qaeda, Cain denied that he had said any such thing. He changed his answer after the debate in a follow-up interview with Cooper and said he would not negotiate with terrorists. ""I misspoke,"" Cain said. ""Because I didn't, you know, things are moving so fast, I misspoke. I would not do that. I simply would not do that."" They were joined on the stage in Las Vegas by former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann, who also attacked the Cain plan. Former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman chose to boycott the debate because of a dispute between Nevada and New Hampshire over the GOP primary calendar. Huntsman is staking his campaign on a win in New Hampshire and held a town hall there Tuesday night instead. That left more time for the rest of the field to make their cases -- and to take aim at the front-runners. Santorum called into doubt Romney's credibility on the matter of repealing President Barack Obama's health care plan because Romney passed a similar plan in Massachusetts. ""You just don't have credibility, Mitt, when it comes to repealing Obamacare,"" Santorum said. ""You are -- you are -- your plan was the basis for Obamacare. Your consultants helped Obama craft Obamacare. And to say that you're going to repeal it, you just -- you have no track record on that that -- that we can trust you that you're going to do that."" The exchange rapidly descended into a shouting match as Santorum refused to let Romney respond. Eventually, Romney said he would ""absolutely not"" impose his Massachusetts plan on the rest of the country. Bachmann, meanwhile, took aim at the Cain tax plan and said it would create a de facto value added tax. But she repeatedly tried to refocus the debate on Obama instead of her GOP opponents. ""We need to repeal Obamacare, repeal the Jobs and Housing Destruction Act known as Dodd-Frank,"" she said. ""President Obama's plan has been a plan for destruction for this economy and failure. I plan to change that."" The candidates were also asked about Robert Jeffress, the controversial Baptist pastor and Perry supporter who recently said the Jesus Christ Church of Latter-day Saints is a ""cult."" They seemed to agree that while a candidate's religion is a legitimate topic in a campaign, the freedom to worship as one chooses is enshrined in the Constitution. ""The concept that we select people based on the church or the synagogue they go to, I think, is a very dangerous and enormous departure from the principles of our Constitution,"" Romney said. Perry, asked if he would repudiate the Jeffress comments, said he already had. ""I said I did not agree with Pastor Jeffress' remarks,"" he said. ""I don't agree with them. I can't apologize any more than that."" Romney accepted the answer. ""That's fine,"" he said.

"London (CNN) -- Pirates? Ravers? At first glance, the portraits are startling and confusing. Hidden behind sunglasses and hats, their faces shrouded in brightly colored scarves and t-shirts, these striking, enigmatic figures could as easily be rebel fighters as models at an edgy runway show. In fact, they are migrant construction workers of the United Arab Emirates, mostly men from India and Pakistan whose cheap labor has powered the rise of the country's skyscrapers. The laborers -- often subjected to exploitative working conditions, according to Human Rights Watch -- are described by photographer Philippe Chancel as ""the new slaves"" of the Gulf. ""But they don't look like slaves,"" said the Frenchman, whose photographic study of the migrant workers was published as a book, ""Workers Emirates,"" by Bernard Chauveau Editeur last month. They don't look like like workers either, he said, their bright colors a stark contrast to traditionally drab depictions of laborers in the West. ""I try to give something very beautiful, a little seductive. I want not to denounce, but to give people the possibility to get inside a very deep problem,"" Chancel added. Chancel began visiting the Emirates in 2007, initially training his camera on the bold new architecture emerging out of the desert. But he soon became fascinated with the brightly-dressed workers in the margins of his viewfinder, a group which seemed to pass unnoticed by the surrounding society. ""The most shocking thing for me is the violence of the indifference,"" he said. Despite their vivid appearance, he likened them to ghosts. ""They were omnipresent but at the same time invisible, as if the eye did not see them as worth attention,"" he writes. The men were anonymous, their faces were shielded from the sun, while their work barely registered with the majority of the population, which spent the day sheltered from the elements inside air-conditioned buildings. Chancel began visiting their building sites and dormitory camps unannounced, shooting ""very fast and very sharp"" to capture realistic representations of the men and their surroundings. On one occasion he was arrested. Having seen the squalid conditions in their dormitories, which he likened to a prison, he became further intrigued to discover the men, who earn salaries of about $160 a month, seem to accept their plight. ""The worker is a slave, but he feels lucky to have an opportunity to try to meet his destiny,"" said Chancel. ""His hell is bearable."" Priyanka Motaparthy, Middle East researcher at Human Rights Watch, said that some workers paid up to $4,000 to recruiters in pursuit of good wages and low living expenses, taking on significant debts just to get the jobs. ""Most are completely trapped by financial circumstances,"" she said. They are let into the country as temporary workers, usually on three-year permits. Tight immigration laws grant their employers extraordinary powers over their lives, with bosses keeping their passports and sponsoring their visas, meaning they cannot easily change jobs if they find the conditions intolerable. ""The climate of fear they live in means they can't strike or protest,"" she said. The economies of the United Arab Emirates, and the other Gulf Cooperation Council countries of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar and Oman, are heavily dependent on foreign workers, with an estimated 15 million foreigners working in the GCC, according to the International Labor Organization. ""Many workers don't know what they're getting into,"" said Motaparthy. ""They're not getting contracts that reflect what the job actually is, and the contracts aren't in their own language."" While there had been some improvements for workers in recent years, with governments introducing wage protection schemes and mandatory health insurance to be paid by employers, exploitation was still widespread, she said. Chancel, who has also produced work on North Korea, is currently exhibiting in London, Paris, Montpelier and Dubai. ""I love the idea of the pictures coming back to the origin,"" he said of the Dubai show. But there was little chance of his subjects coming across portraits of themselves in a Dubai gallery. ""Of course not,"" he said.","Photographer Philippe Chancel has released a book of portraits of migrant laborers in the UAE .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Actress Lindsay Lohan missed her first day of community service at the Los Angeles County morgue Thursday, one day after a judge rebuked her for similar failures, revoked her probation and forced her to post $100,000 bail. ""Lindsay arrived at the morgue approximately 20 minutes late and will be returning for orientation tomorrow,"" said her publicist Steven Honig. ""Her lateness was due to a combination of not knowing what entrance to go through and confusion caused by the media waiting for her arrival,"" Honig said in a statement. ""Lindsay spoke with the supervisors at the morgue. They showed her how to get in, and everything is all cleared up."" Chief Coroner Craig Harvey said Lohan failed to show up on time -- 7 a.m. PT Thursday -- to the coroner's office. Though she arrived late, Lohan was turned away because there wasn't enough time to complete her hours for the day, officials said. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Stephanie Sautner ruled Wednesday that after Lohan posted $100,000 bail for her probation revocation, she had to perform two working shifts -- or eight hours a day -- twice a week until her probation revocation hearing November 2. Lohan's tardiness Thursday doesn't mean she is turned away from the program, Harvey said. If Lohan shows up Friday on time, she will be allowed to work and perform her community service, Harvey said. The coroner's office will dismiss Lohan from her morgue duties only if she does something ""terribly"" wrong or shows misconduct, Harvey said. Sautner revoked probation for Lohan because of her failure to comply with community service at a downtown Los Angeles women's center. Under Sautner's ruling, once Lohan made bail the same day, the actress now must perform 16 hours of community service a week -- over a minimum of two days a week -- at the county morgue before her probation violation hearing next month. Lohan, 25, was on probation after pleading guilty in May to stealing a necklace from a Venice, California, jewelry store. She served five weeks of home confinement ending in June for that misdemeanor theft and violation of another probation. Lohan's legal woes began in 2007 with two drunken driving arrests and have been compounded by her failure to attend counseling classes and her failures of alcohol and drug tests. Her current probation calls for her to perform 360 hours at the Los Angeles Downtown Women's Center and 120 hours at the county morgue within a year. But the judge expressed anger Wednesday at Lohan's repeated probation failures. She said Lohan posted nine absences at the women's center since her last court hearing July 21 -- and performed, at most, only two hours of service. Lohan's attempt to perform community service at a nearby Red Cross facility -- instead of the women's center -- was voided Wednesday because the judge said she didn't authorize that change. After the hearing, Lohan publicist Honig released a statement: ""Lindsay is hoping this matter will be resolved on November 2 and the court will reinstate probation and allow her to continue fulfilling her community service."" Lohan's estranged father, Michael Lohan, told HLN's ""Issues With Jane Velez-Mitchell"" that his daughter needs ""a very, very intensive"" program of rehabilitation for substance abuse. ""What the judge did, she had to do,"" he said Wednesday. But he said jail time would not be the proper remedy. ""She's not going to be working the morgue. She's going to wind up in a morgue if someone doesn't do something to get her help,"" he said. At one point during this week's hearing, Los Angeles city attorneys Lisa Houle and Melanie Chavira asked the court to revoke Lohan's probation and impose jail time because of her failure to do community service. One of the city attorneys said Lohan ""is in violation for getting herself kicked out of the women's center, which she was ordered to do."" But Lohan's attorney told the court that the actress received ""a glowing"" probation report, which said that ""Ms. Lohan has reached a turning point"" in her behavior and maturity. The judge raised several questions about the reliability of that report, however. Sautner remarked how the probation report showed Lohan had excused absences from community service between September 9 and October 5 so that she could travel to New York, Milan, Italy, and Paris for work. But a psychologist's report said Lohan had perfect attendance for counseling every week, the judge observed. ""The psychologist said she appeared in person for her counseling every Tuesday,"" the judge said. ""I don't know how she did that."" ""Did she go to Milan for five days and come back in time or go to Paris for five days and come back in time?"" Sautner asked the defense attorney. ""If she was gone from September 9 to October 5, did she get beamed across the pond? I don't know how that happened,"" the judge said. Lohan's attorney, Shawn Holley, told Sautner that she didn't know the specifics of Lohan's psychological appointments, but the attorney said the arrangement did call for phone conferences. Holley added that Lohan's work in Europe was done to support her and her family -- and affected her ability to carry out the community service. ""Because the work is out of the county, it did cause a disruption to her schedule"" to do community service, Holley said. Lohan's community service at the county morgue won't be easy, the judge noted. ""They don't mess around and you show up and do what they tell you to do,"" Sautner said. CNN's Carolyn Sung contributed to this report.","NEW: Coroner says Lindsay Lohan missed her 7 a.m. PT start time .

"(CNN) -- Pirates off Somalia have hijacked two more vessels in the Gulf of Aden, the European Union naval force said Saturday -- the third and fourth vessels they have captured this week. The British-flagged Asian Glory was seized off Somalia late Friday, the naval force said. The nationality of the pirates was unclear, because the hijacking happened outside of the force's operations area, it said. The British Foreign Office would not confirm the hijacking, but said no British nationals were aboard. Also Friday, Somali pirates seized the Singaporean-flagged chemical tanker M/V Pramoni, also in the Gulf of Aden, the naval force said. The 20,000-ton chemical tanker was carrying a crew of 24 and was heading to Kandla, India, when attacked, the naval force said. The crew consists of 17 Indonesians, five Chinese, one Nigerian and one Vietnamese, the naval force said. The ship's master reported all the crew were well after the hijacking, the naval force said. The ship was heading toward Somalia after the hijacking, the naval force said. The Asian Glory is owned by London-based Zodiac Maritime Agencies, according to Lloyd's Register of Ships. Zodiac also owns another vessel that was hijacked in the Gulf of Aden, the British-flagged chemical tanker St. James Park, according to the company's Web site. The St. James Park has a crew of 26, consisting of Bulgarians, Filipinos, Georgians, Indians, Poles, Romanians, Russians, Turks and Ukrainians, the EU naval force said. The vessel had arrived at the Somali port of Hobyo, a pirate stronghold, the naval force said Saturday. Monday, pirates also hijacked the Greek-owned carrier Navios Apollon, the naval force said. It had been heading for Thailand, but was on its way to the Somali coast after the hijacking, it said.

"Kuwait City (CNN) -- Kuwait's leaders met in emergency session Thursday, vowing to clamp down on violence after protesters forced their way inside Parliament. ""The adoption of such a chaotic approach by the rioters"" risked the country's security and ""is considered to be an unprecedented step on the path to anarchy and lawlessness,"" the emir of Kuwait, Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, said in comments quoted by state-run news agency KUNA. The protests late Wednesday led to the injury of five police and Kuwait National Guard officers, the Interior Ministry said. Members of the opposition vow to step up their protests. ""The popular opposition will escalate,"" Saad Alajmi, former minister of information and now a prominent opposition figure, told CNN. ""This is a people's opposition,"" he added. Alajmi called for the Parliament to dissolve. U.S. State Department deputy spokesman Mark Toner said Kuwait has a history of ""political freedom and cooperation"" and that it should respect peaceful protests. Protests in Kuwait have taken place at times throughout the year, since before the Arab Spring brought about demonstrations throughout the Arab world. But the anti-corruption protests have turned more violent recently, after members of the Kuwaiti opposition saw revolutions in Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya, and fighting between protesters and government forces in Syria. Prime Minister Sheikh Nasser al-Mohammad al-Sabah has had six previous governments brought down by opposition elements over the years. The Kuwaiti opposition is now pushing not only for the downfall of his government, but for the prime minister himself to step down. Many chanted that they want to ""overthrow"" him, using iconic slogans of the Arab Spring. The emir, however, is firmly committed to keeping al-Sabah, a member of the royal family, in office. Government representative Ali Fahad Al-Rashid warned Thursday that the country will be taking new steps against the protesters. ""The actions witnessed yesterday are unfamiliar to the Kuwaiti society and threaten the security and stability of the country's general system,"" he said, according to KUNA. ""Therefore, national responsibility calls for stricter measures to confront this chaotic behavior."" ""Democracy in this country should not be contaminated or misused to serve questionable agendas,"" he said. ""Kuwait will not be a place for pre-planned sabotage."" The Interior Ministry said the crowd of protesters Wednesday night ""brawled with the police, the National Guard and other state agencies,"" and property was damaged. A witness told CNN angry protesters broke into the Parliament demanding that the prime minister step down. The witness, a Kuwaiti journalist, asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter. Videos that appear to have been shot from cell phones and posted on YouTube show a throng of protesters at the Parliament chanting, ""The people must remove the prime minister!"" One protester is also seen saying, ""Leave Nasser,"" in an apparent reference to Prime Minister Sheikh Nasser al-Mohammad al-Sabah. Another video shows people entering the assembly building and shouting, ""Let the people enter the people's assembly."" The country has no elections for the executive branch. The emir, whose position is hereditary, appoints the prime minister and the deputy prime ministers. The last parliamentary elections were held in 2009. The prime minister's cabinet resigned in March. The State Department's human rights report on Kuwait, published earlier this year, notes that the country has a population of 3.4 million, of whom 1.1 million are citizens. ""Local observers and the press considered the May 16, 2009, parliamentary election generally free and fair. Security forces reported to civilian authorities,"" the report says. ""Principal human rights problems included limitations on citizens' right to change their government. There were reports of security forces abusing prisoners. Authorities limited freedoms of speech, press, assembly, association, and religion."" With an economy based mostly on its oil, Kuwait has relatively high per capita income and low unemployment. The protests have focused centrally on alleged political corruption, rather than the economy.

"(CNN) -- Five purported Amish splinter group members, who are suspected in a string of hair-cutting attacks on Amish men and women in their community, are scheduled to be back in court Wednesday morning for arraignment, said the sheriff of Jefferson County, Ohio. Four separate incidents are being investigated in the eastern Ohio counties of Jefferson, Holmes, Carroll and Trumbull, said Frank Abdalla, the Jefferson County sheriff. Officials report the first assault happened on September 6. The last attack was on October 4, just days before three of the five suspects were arrested. The men are accused of breaking into multiple homes and holding the victims down before using scissors or battery operated clippers to forcibly cut off women's hair and men's beards. Lester Mullet, 26, Johnny Mullet, 38, and Levi Miller, 53, were arrested last Friday in Jefferson County, Abdalla said. Daniel Mullet and Eli Miller turned themselves in to Holmes County authorities a few days later. All five men are charged with kidnapping and burglary. They were released on $50,000 bond, which was paid by Bishop Sam Mullet, who, according to Abdalla, is the leader of an extreme Amish splinter group. Three of the suspects are Mullet's sons; a third is his nephew. Abdalla is not the only one who believes Mullet may be behind the attacks. ""This renegade leader is like a cult,"" said Donald Kraybill, an Amish scholar at Elizabethtown College. ""He (Mullet) masquerades under the Amish name, using religion as a way to create a kind of barrier between him and law enforcement."" ""Nothing moves in this (particular) Amish community unless (Bishop Mullet) says it moves,"" Abdalla said. According to the sheriff, Mullet instigated the attacks after being ""shunned from his faith some years ago."" ""His behavior contradicts all the standard Amish expectation for behavior,"" Kraybill said. The assaults are considered a particularly egregious offense in the Amish society, and can be considered an attack on the Amish identity. ""It's very shameful,"" said Kraybill. As a symbol of adulthood, Amish men typically grow beards after they get married and Amish women do not cut their hair, said Kraybill. The practices are based on biblical teachings, Kraybill said. ""I don't know of any other cases like this,"" said Kraybill. ""Amish-on-Amish violence is very rare."" Kraybill also pointed out that it's not correct to call the attacks Amish-on-Amish violence because Mullet is not recognized by the mainstream group. Both Holmes and Jefferson counties have large Amish populations. It is rare for the deeply private religious group to involve outsiders in their internal and religious problems. But Kraybill said when it becomes serious or involves some kind of violence, they will turn to outside agencies for help. This ""is a difficult, terrible crime,"" Abdalla said. ""We are doing everything we can do.""","The five Amish men face kidnapping and burglary charges .

"(CNN) -- The death of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, who was killed Thursday in his hometown of Sirte, Libya, is ""an important step"" for Libya, but don't expect the fighting to end right away, said CNN senior international correspondent Ben Wedeman. Wedeman, the first Western television reporter to enter and report from inside Libya during the war, talked about how Gadhafi's life ended and what his death means for Libya's future and the civil war. Q: There are reports that Gadhafi was hiding in a hole, possibly a sewer or drainage ditch, like former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein before he was captured. It doesn't seem like Gadhafi's M.O. What do you make of this? Ben Wedeman: We understood when he left Tripoli in August that he left with a large entourage, with lots of cash ... and a lot of weapons. And for him to end up basically in the same sort of spider hole that Saddam Hussein did seems a bit odd, a bit out of character. When I was there, we were hearing all sorts of reports: that he was in Bani Walid -- that was the explanation for the level of resistance there -- that he was in an oasis in the southern part of the country, and that he could be in Sirte. So it's a bit of a surprise the way he, in theory, met his end. He was not somebody that people expected to really go this early. Let's not forget that Baghdad, for instance, in the case of Iraq, it fell in late April (2003) (and) Saddam Hussein was not caught until December of 2003. It was expected that Gadhafi could be able to hold out a bit longer than this. Q: What does Gadhafi's reported death mean to his loyalists, those fighting the National Transition Council? And how will the NTC fill the power vacuum left behind by Gadhafi, who ruled Libya for 42 years? Wedeman:  I think perhaps his role as a leader of the anti-NTC insurgency may have been somewhat overstated. I was in parts of Libya where I spoke to lots of people who were opposed to the new rulers of Libya, but not necessarily great supporters of Moammar Gadhafi. There is a worry that this new regime in Libya will be very slow, if (they) succeed at all, in moving to democracy. There's a worry that there's going to be a lot of revenge, a lot of, basically, lawlessness. Some of the times when we were told that these were Gadhafi loyalists fighting for the leader, it was wrong. They were actually people defending their homes, afraid that their homes would be looted, and we have seen instances where looting has been a serious problem. So Gadhafi ... was a rallying point for a certain element of the opponents of the new regime in Libya. But he wasn't necessarily leading all of them. Q: Does that mean you think those loyal to Gadhafi will continue to fight even after his death? Wedeman: We have to realize this has been a complete change of regime, and many of these people (in the NTC) have no experience running the country. Yes, it's an important step along the way, but the killing of Moammar Gadhafi certainly doesn't mean that it's going to be smooth sailing. I mean, all you have to do is look around (Libya): Egypt , the revolution (took) only 18 days -- and months, months and months later, it's still a very unstable and uncertain place. Libya has certain elements working in its favor: a smaller population, a better educated population, lots in the way of natural resources. But no, just because Moammar Gadhafi is gone -- we believe -- doesn't mean things are going to be rosy from here on in. Let's not forget even in Iraq -- and there are huge differences -- the first few months after the fall of Saddam Hussein were relatively quiet. It's when the new people in power start to exercise that power at every level of society, things can get complicated. There's been a lot of talk about tribal differences (in Libya) We haven't really seen that play out ... but I would not in any sense bet my bottom dollar that Libya will be smooth sailing now that Gadhafi is dead.","CNN's Ben Wedeman spoke to CNN about the death of Moammar Gadhafi .

"(CNN) -- Described as ""serious,"" ""intelligent"" and a ""good strategic planner"" by a former colleague, Louis Neal ReVille worked in child-related jobs for a decade prior to his arrest last month in a case involving criminal sexual conduct with a minor, officials said Wednesday. The former Citadel cadet-turned-camp counselor now faces a series of sex charges, including three counts of criminal sexual conduct with a minor and three counts of lewd act on a minor, according to Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, police. ""Those of us who worked with him were in complete shock,"" said Brent Egan, school board chairman of Coastal Christian Preparatory School, where ReVille, 32, served as vice principal. ""He was just very effective (in his job as an administrator). He was a serious, intelligent guy, and a good strategic planner."" In 2007, The Citadel received an allegation from a former camper that, five years earlier, ReVille had invited a boy into his room at The Citadel Summer Camp to watch pornography. Another camper was also present. They did not touch each other, but engaged in sexual activity, The Citadel said. On Monday, the military college in Charleston, South Carolina, said authorities there should have pursued the matter further at the time. The Citadel has said a review of ReVille's records in 2007 revealed no other complaints, and his file included a clean background check. He was a highly respected cadet and denied the accusation, the school added. The case has drawn national attention in the wake of the Penn State child sex abuse scandal involving former coach Jerry Sandusky. Sandusky faces 40 counts in what authorities allege was the sexual abuse of eight boys. The case also led to the ouster Penn State President Graham Spanier and head football coach Joe Paterno. Both Penn State and The Citadel have come under fire for how authorities at each institution handled the separate accusations. Citadel accuser says there are more victims . ""It's amazing the number of places he worked at and volunteered,"" said Ken Ayoub, director of Mount Pleasant, South Carolina's recreation department where in the summer of 2001 ReVille began volunteering as a children's tennis coach. ""He's a married guy. It's all just very disturbing."" Ayoub said each volunteer undergoes criminal background checks, and that ReVille's had come up clean. The volunteer role was one of many involving children that ReVille, nicknamed ""Skip,"" pursued throughout his career. The former Alabama resident first took a job as a summer counselor at the South Carolina military college in 2001, one year before he graduated, according to a statement from the school. There he worked with groups of children between the ages of 10 and 15 during two summer sessions at the college, the school said. A year later, ReVille became a foster parent for the South Carolina Department of Social Services, said Marilyn Matheus, a spokeswoman for the agency. Between 2004 and 2006, he assumed child-care responsibilities that included providing room and board to children who commonly suffer from abuse or neglect, said Matheus. His volunteering continued at Charleston's Moultrie Middle School before taking a job as vice principal at the state's Coastal Christian Preparatory School, according to Egan. Egan said ReVille ""seemed to have a genuine interest in doing things the best way possible.""

"Washington (CNN) -- GOP presidential candidate Herman Cain faced a new claim of sexually inappropriate behavior Monday as a Chicago woman told reporters the former head of the National Restaurant Association groped her after a dinner together in 1997. Sharon Bialek, who worked at the restaurant group's education foundation until shortly before the alleged groping incident, said Cain unexpectedly put his hand on her leg beneath her skirt ""toward my genitals."" She also said he pushed her head toward his crotch. Cain stopped when she protested, Bialek told a news conference. Looking into the television cameras, Bialek said: ""I want you, Mr. Cain, to come clean. Just admit what you did."" Gloria Allred a girl's best friend . The accusation follows the disclosure last week that the restaurant association provided payments to two women who left the group after alleging sexual harassment by Cain, also in the late 1990s. Cain has denied all accusations of sexual harassment, and his campaign put out a fresh denial after Bialek made her accusations on Monday. ""All allegations of harassment against Mr. Cain are completely false,"" a campaign statement said. ""Mr. Cain has never harassed anyone."" Earlier accuser's attorney talks to CNN . Since becoming public on October 30 in a report by Politico, the sexual harassment accusations have overwhelmed the bid by the former pizza company executive to win the Republican presidential nomination. Cain, a favorite of tea party conservatives, has risen to the top of the polls following strong performances in several debates and the release of his ""9-9-9"" tax plan that sets flat 9% rates for corporate and income taxes and also creates a 9% national sales tax. However, Bialek's accusation raises fresh questions about whether Cain has been candid about the allegations that he sexually harassed women at the restaurant association when he headed the group from 1996-99. Bialek said she started to work at the group's foundation in 1996 but was laid off in 1997. The association confirmed Bialek's employment dates as December 30, 1996, to June 20, 1997. Shortly after getting let go, Bialek said, she contacted Cain -- whom she had met at the group's Chicago convention -- to seek help in finding a job. She traveled to Washington, where Cain worked, and found he had upgraded her hotel room to a luxury suite without telling her. They had dinner at an Italian restaurant, she said, and then Cain asked if she had been to the association offices in the capital. Cain made his advances on the way, according to Bialek. ""He said, 'You want a job, right?' "" she told reporters at the news conference organized by celebrity attorney Gloria Allred. Bialek took no questions from reporters, but Allred said Bialek had told two people at the time about what happened. Bialek filed no complaint with the restaurant association because she no longer worked there, Allred said. Asked why Bialek was coming forward now, Allred said it was in solidarity with Cain's other accusers and harassed women everywhere. Cain has previously complained the sexual harassment allegations amount to a baseless media onslaught against his campaign. Polls have yet to indicate any significant effect on his support -- in fact, the campaign reported a spike in donations Monday. Cain spokesman J.D. Gordon told CNN the campaign raked in $2 million during the past week. By comparison, Cain raised $2.8 million between June and October. On Sunday, one of Cain's rivals called for keeping the issue alive, saying the necessary scrutiny of presidential candidates requires Cain to answer all questions about what happened. On Saturday, Cain scolded reporters who asked about the issue following a debate with fellow conservative Newt Gingrich in Texas. ""Don't even go there,"" Cain told one questioner who'd asked about the allegations. Asked again later, he responded: ""What I'm saying is this -- we are getting back on message, end of story. Back on message. Read all of the other accounts, where everything has been answered -- end of story."" On Friday, a lawyer for one of the accusers reported by Politico released a statement saying she stood by her claims against Cain. However, the woman has so far refused to allow her identity or specifics of her allegations to be made public. In response to the new allegation Monday, the attorney, Joel Bennett, said he believes it corroborates his client's story and called it ""similar conduct by the same person."" He refused to provide further details. Cain supporters have said the anonymous allegations and lack of details showed the political nature of the accusations reported by Politico. Bialek is the first woman to publicly accuse Cain and provide specifics about what allegedly happened. ""It's up to Herman Cain to get the information out and get it out in total,"" Jon Huntsman, the former Utah governor running far behind Cain in polls so far, told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" program. ""That's important because we've got some real issues to discuss in this campaign, and this is taking all the bandwidth out of the discussion. So we're not able to talk about jobs. We're not able to talk about our position in the world. And that hurts."" Conservatives, angered by the media attention to the potentially fatal accusations for the tea party favorite's campaign, argued that the lack of specifics -- with no public disclosure yet of an accuser's name or specific offense alleged -- showed it was all more circus than substance. Legitimate issue or political drama? ""Until something comes out that's concrete, I think it is politics as usual,"" retiring Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, told CNN's ""State of the Union."" To Rep. Darrell Issa, a California Republican backing former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney in the GOP race, Cain is undergoing a difficult transition from private business figure to public politician. ""To go directly from being a businessman, without substantial time in the government arena, both the vetting and the knowledge of it, is really hard,"" Issa told NBC. ""It's virtually impossible"" and in Cain's presidential quest, may be ""a bridge too far."" Former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, a strong Democratic Party voice, suggested Cain's troubles were only part of the problem for Republicans on women's issues. ""I think what you're seeing is a huge assault on women's rights in the Republican parties, and an extreme right-wing that has taken over that is going to make it very difficult for anybody in a general election in the Republican Party to be a centrist,"" Richardson said on NBC. CNN's Kevin Bohn and Shannon Travis contributed to this report.","NEW: Cain camp reports $2 million haul since allegations broke .

"(CNN) -- The terrorist group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has confirmed the death of U.S.-born militant cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, calling him a martyr, according to a statement posted Sunday on jihadi internet forums. Al-Awlaki was killed by a U.S. drone strike in Yemen on September 30, but American officials said internet postings following his death indicated many who share his ideas did not believe he had been killed and were seeking confirmation. Another American named Samir Khan and two other people also died, officials said. Khan was the co-editor of the terrorist network's English-language online propaganda and recruiting magazine, Inspire. Computer virus infects U.S. drone operation program . The AQAP ""eulogy"" states that while the United States killed al-Awlaki, it ""cannot kill his ideas,"" according to an English translation provided by the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors jihadi forums. The statement also picks up on a theme being discussed in the United States: whether the United States had the right to target and kill al-Awlaki without a legal trial and guilty verdict. The controversy is complicated by the fact al-Awlaki was a U.S. citizen. The message said the United States killed al-Awlaki and Khan but ""did not prove the accusation against them, and did not present evidence against them."" The statement claims such actions go against the values the U.S. espouses. The New York Times reported Sunday that the Justice Department prepared legal guidance in the summer of 2010 which said the United States could kill al-Awlaki if it was not possible to capture him. In Sunday's message, AQAP also promised to ""retaliate soon"" for the deaths of al-Awlaki and the three others. The U.S. issued a worldwide alert earlier this month warning of ""the potential for retaliation against U.S. citizens and interests"" following al-Awlaki's killing. Born in Las Cruces, New Mexico, al-Awlaki lived in the United States until the age of 7, when his family returned to Yemen. He returned to the United States in 1991 for college and remained until 2002. During his stay in the United States, he served as an imam in California and Virginia, and interacted with three of the men who went on to become September 11, 2001, hijackers, according to the 9/11 Commission report. He publicly condemned the attack afterward. U.S. officials say he recruited Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, the Nigerian man known as the underwear bomber, who was charged with trying to blow up a trans-Atlantic flight as it landed in Detroit on December 25, 2009. The militant cleric is also said to have exchanged e-mails with accused Fort Hood shooter Maj. Nidal Hasan, who is accused of killing a dozen fellow soldiers in Texas.","Terrorist group confirms militant cleric's death in online ""eulogy""

"(CNN) -- Moammar Gadhafi had been on the run for months, as opposition fighters aided by NATO airstrikes pushed him and his supporters from the Libyan capital of Tripoli and other long-time strongholds. Finally, on Thursday, the long-time Libyan leader's life ended around where it began -- in Sirte, the coastal city where he was born. Here is a timeline of some key moments leading up to Gadhafi's death, according to Libya's interim Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril, other National Transitional Council officials and other sources: . -- Having taken over the city of Bani Walid earlier in the week, fighters aligned with Libya's National Transitional Council turn their attention on Sirte -- the last holdout of Gadhafi loyalists. -- French fighter jets and a Predator drone, firing a Hellfire missile, strike a convoy near Sirte on Thursday morning, a U.S. Defense official says. That official is unable to say if Gadhafi was in the targeted envoy. But a senior NATO official says that Gadhafi was part of that convoy and survived the attack. -- Around noon on Thursday, transitional council officials announce that their fighters have taken control of Sirte, despite pockets of resistance. There is no official word then about Gadhafi. -- During the day Thursday, Gadhafi is captured alive and in good health in Sirte, according to the interim prime minster. -- According to Ali Aujali, Libya's ambassador to the United States, troops find Gadhafi during the day in a large drainage pipe in Sirte. Daily Telegraph reporter Ben Farmer in Sirte later tells CNN's Anderson Cooper the pipe is about 3 feet wide and filled with trash and sand. -- Gadhafi is alive and in good health when he's captured, according to the interim prime minster. -- He does not resist arrest. -- At the time, he is wearing an undershirt and trousers and carrying a gun. -- While being transferred to a vehicle -- destined for Misrata, Jibril says later -- Gadhafi is shot in the right arm. -- Grainy video broadcast on Arabic satellite networks shows a bloodied but still-alive Gadhafi being hauled onto a truck. -- Eventually, National Transitional Council forces put Gadhafi into the vehicle. As soon as it takes off, a firefight erupts involving council forces and those loyal to Gadhafi. -- Caught in the crossfire, Gadhafi is shot in the head. -- He dies a few moments before arriving at a hospital, a coroner says, according to Jibril. Another video shows a dead Gadhafi with what appears to be a head wound. -- At the hospital, DNA samples are taken -- including blood and saliva -- that confirm that the dead man is indeed Moammar Gadhafi. -- Council representatives get in touch with the International Criminal Court, which had charged Gadhafi with war crimes. After sending the coroner's report and photos, the court gives Libyan authorities permission to bury Gadhafi. -- Soon after the news breaks on Thursday afternoon, crowds throughout Libya erupt in celebration of Gadhafi's death.","NEW: Gadhafi is found in a large drainage pipe, a Libyan envoy says .

"(CNN) -- Germany underlined their impressive credentials ahead of Euro 2012 with a 3-0 thrashing of arch-rivals the Netherlands on Tuesday in Hamburg. The Germans, who will be among the favorites next year in Ukraine and Poland, swept aside the 2010 World Cup runners-up with veteran striker Miroslav Klose inspirational. He set up Thomas Muller to put the home side ahead in the early stages before helping himself to the second goal and his 63rd for Germany in the 26th minute. It left him just five short of the legendary Gerd Muller's all-time record. The 33-year-old Lazio striker then worked in Real Madrid's Mesut Ozil for a close range strike in the 66th minute as Germany sealed their first win over the Dutch since 1996. ""The whole team made the match a lot of fun to play in,"" Ozil told AFP. Meanwhile, world and European champions Spain needed two goals in the final seven minutes to rescue a 2-2 draw with Costa Rica in their friendly clash. Just three days after a 1-0 defeat to England, Vicente Del Bosque's Spain fell behind on 31 minutes in San Jose when forward Randall Brenes capitalized on an error from goalkeeper Iker Casillas to clip a shot over defender Carles Puyol and into the empty net. It was a nightmare moment for Real Madrid's Casillas, who was celebrating making his 127th appearance for Spain and becoming their most-capped player. It got worse for Spain three minutes before half time when Lorient striker Joel Campbell, who is on-loan from English Premier League side Arsenal, doubled Costa Rica's lead. Spain pressed in the second half, eventually breaking the home team's resistance with seven minutes remaining when Manchester City playmaker David Silva finished after a neat exchange with midfielder Andres Iniesta. Barcelona's David Villa spared Spain's blushes as the match entered stoppage time, stooping to head home his 51st international goal and rescue a draw for the visitors. Elsewhere, England made it two wins in five days at Wembley with a hard-fought 1-0 win over Sweden. England made several changes from the side which beat Spain 1-0 last Saturday, but were largely in command for much of the match against their fellow Euro 2012 qualifiers. It was England's first win over Sweden in 43 years and captain John Terry, recalled to the team despite being under investigation for alleged racial abuse, said he never had any intention of sitting the match out because of the controversy. ""No chance,"" he said. ""I'm very passionate, very confident being England captain and very proud to be, also."" England's only goal in the first half, their 2,000th in internationals, was originally given to midfielder Gareth Barry, but his header took a final touch off Sweden's Daniel Majstorovic. Debutant Jack Rodwell missed a glorious opportunity for his first goal for England and Manchester United youngster Phil Jones also went close as the home side might have added further to their tally against a below-par Swedish side who rarely threatened. Meanwhile in Rome, Sebastian Fernandez scored the only goal of the game as Uruguay beat Italy 1-0 win in the Olympic Stadium. Mario Balotelli went close for Italy before former Juventus fullback Martin Caceres crossed for Fernandez to help the ball home.","Germany beat the Netherlands 3-0 in international friendly in Hamburg .

"(CNN) -- Three former leaders of Sierra Leone's brutal Revolutionary United Front guerrilla movement were found guilty Wednesday of crimes against humanity including murder, rape, sexual slavery and forced marriages, the Special Court for Sierra Leone announced. The RUF rebels were notorious for brutality. The charges stemmed from a civil war in the diamond-rich West African nation that lasted more than 10 years and stood out for its viciousness, even on a continent that has suffered many vicious conflicts. It led to tens of thousands of deaths and more than 2 million people fleeing their homes in the country of 6 million. The RUF rebels were known for hacking off civilians' hands and feet during the war, which lasted from March 1991 until January 2002. Former RUF ""interim leader"" Issa Hassan Sesay, former RUF commander Morris Kallon and former RUF chief of security Augustine Gbao each faced 18 counts of war crimes, crimes against humanity, attacking U.N. peacekeepers, and recruiting and using child soldiers. Sesay and Kallon each were found guilty on 16 counts, while Gbao was found guilty on 14, the court announced. They were charged with ""extermination, murder, rape, sexual slavery, forced marriages and physical violence"" as well as enslaving civilians, mutilating people, and pillaging. They were convicted on all counts except two specifically related to the kidnapping of international peacekeepers in May 2000. Gbao was also found not guilty of two other charges related to an attack on peacekeepers, although Sesay and Kallon were convicted of those crimes. Human Rights Watch senior Africa researcher Corinne Dufka called the verdict ""very significant."" ""The RUF were renowned for leading one of the most brutal rebel movements in modern days. Everyone knows about the signature atrocity of limb amputation, but there was also horrific sexual violence, abductions, use of child soldiers, and forced marriages,"" she told CNN by phone from Senegal in West Africa. She lived Sierra Leone from 1999 to 2004, documenting atrocities. ""It was difficult to find someone who hadn't been a victim of or a witness to a war crime,"" she said.  Watch Jim Clancy's report on the battle for Sierra Leone » . Amnesty International also welcomed the convictions, but said much more needs to be done to bring hundreds of other perpetrators to justice. The group called it a ""positive, but still insufficient, step in the fight against impunity"" in the country, and said ""many others -- numbering perhaps in the several hundreds -- must be investigated in Sierra Leone."" Eight people have now been convicted of war crimes connected with the conflict -- some on the rebel's side and some on the government's. The Special Court's mandate is to try only ""those who bear greatest responsibility for atrocities committed in Sierra Leone."" Sesay, Kallon and Gbao had pleaded not guilty on all counts in a trial that lasted nearly five years. They are due to be sentenced within a month. The Special Court cannot impose the death penalty. The RUF seized most of Sierra Leone from the government and fought international and African peacekeepers. The capital, Freetown, was retaken by international forces in 2000. The trial of the three former leaders was the last of three to be held at the Special Court, a unique joint project of Sierra Leone and the United Nations. Former Liberian President Charles Taylor is on trial separately at an international court in The Hague for his role in the conflict. The prosecution rested in the Taylor case last month after a year of presenting its arguments. The Leonardo DiCaprio movie ""Blood Diamond"" is set in Sierra Leone during the civil war. Despite the country's diamond wealth, 70 percent of the population lives below the poverty line. In the days of the slave trade, the West African country was the departure point for thousands of captives bound for the Americas. Freetown was founded in 1787 as a home for repatriated former slaves.","NEW: Human rights groups welcome convictions of three Sierra Leone rebel leaders .

"(CNN) -- Iranian student Puyan Mahmudian scored the sixth highest marks in his year group in his entrance exam, but was rejected for a Masters degree in chemical engineering at Amirkabir University in Tehran. The problem was not his academic record, but his political background, according to human rights groups, which note that Mahmudian had previously been jailed for being editor of a student magazine that was critical of the government. Mahmudian, now 25, believes he is one of hundreds of so-called ""starred students,"" whom campaigners claim are denied access to university or expelled because of their religious or political beliefs. A report called ""Punishing Stars"" by the non-governmental organization International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran names 217 students who it says have been deprived of education because of their religion or political activism in the last five years. It says the real number is much higher as many did not want to be named. Many of those listed are members of the Baha'i Faith, the largest religious minority in Iran, with around 300,000 members, according to the official website of the faith in the United States. It says Baha'is have been persecuted in Iran since the faith started there in the mid-19th century. The conservative clergy considers followers of the Baha'i faith to be part of a wayward sect and apostates. Other ""starred students"" are human rights activists, supporters of women's rights, members of the political opposition and student journalists, campaigners claim. Now, a grassroots campaign, which began in Germany and has spread to other countries around the world, is drawing attention to alleged denial of education in Iran. The campaign, called ""Can You Solve This?"" publicizes a QR code which, when scanned by smart phones, directs people to a website with an animated video. The QR code has been printed on flyers, banners, pavements and t-shirts in coffee shops, streets and university campuses. In Germany, the QR code was used without any other information to build up mystery around the campaign. Ruha Reyani, a second generation Iranian living in Germany and one of the architects of the campaign, said: ""We are at the start of the university year and there's a big push from the Iranian government to use denial of education as a tool of persecution. ""We want people to come to take action by sending letters to their political leaders."" Events to support the campaign have already been held in Germany, the United Kingdom, Brazil, India and the Netherlands, and are planned for Canada, the United States, France, Italy and other countries. Esra'a Al Shafei, founder of Mideast Youth, one of the organizations supporting the campaign, said: ""It's a creative and dynamic campaign that appeals to young people everywhere. The video has had more than 70,000 views and more than 5,000 letters have been sent through the website."" Mahmudian, now living in Germany, was arrested and jailed in 2007 while editor of a student magazine at Amirkabir University of Technology in Tehran. In a case highlighted at the time by Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and the Committee to Protect Journalists, Mahmudian and seven other students were arrested, accused of defaming Islam in their publications. Mahmudian said the members of the information ministry had circulated forged editions of their publications containing offensive articles. Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, said in a press release at the time: ""The Iranian authorities are using the flimsiest of pretexts to arrests student journalists and activists. ""Even the Judiciary has admitted that these students had nothing to do with the forged publications."" Mahmudian said: ""I spent more than 50 days in solitary confinement. They used physical and mental torture. I went on hunger strike for 11 days to be allowed to make one phone call to my mother to tell her I was okay. ""After 80 days of extreme pressure they got a videotaped confession from us inside prison. We apologized to the president and were released and allowed to go back to university."" It was after his undergraduate studies finished and he applied to do his Masters that the incident caused him more trouble. He said he was called in to the information ministry for three interrogation sessions. ""They asked me to sign a guarantee that I wouldn't continue any political, social and cultural activities and that I would cooperate with the information ministry,"" he said. ""I accepted to end my political activities but refused to collaborate with them,"" he said. Mahmudian was told he had not passed the ""general"" qualification for the Masters course. He tried to make a legal appeal against the decision but was told there were no avenues. He later moved to Berlin, Germany, to do his masters degree and has no immediate plans to return to Iran. Repeated efforts to reach Iranian officials for comment were unsuccessful. Messages left with the Iranian consulate in London were not returned. The report ""Punishing Stars"" released in December last year claims that the Ministry of Intelligence has used a system of three stars as a method of discrimination against students since Mahmoud Ahmadinejad became president in 2005. It said that in 2007, in response to pressure from starred students and the media, the government announced that it would no longer use the star system. However, the report claims, the discrimination has continued as a de facto policy.","Report: Hundreds of Iranian students rejected from university for political or religious beliefs .

Now, we're facing the prospect of a more fundamental overhaul in western nations: a European Union Winter. The ongoing fiscal crisis in the eurozone is taking its political toll on the leaders of the troubled economies. One by one, they fall. In the south, developments are accompanied by drama. Greece's George Papandreou resigned, after two years in office, as a precondition for the creation of a coalition government in Greece. Italy's Silvio Berlusconi, whose fall has been predicted for years because of his business dealings and private life choices, has stepped down. But the dominoes don't stop with these Mediterranean countries. Nicolas Sarkozy of France faces a close to impossible re-election in the spring. The French are weary of austerity, but their country will continue to have to make cuts in order to withstand market pressures and hope for a return to growth. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany is faring badly in the polls as the economy there slows down and the money for bailouts will most likely need to increase. Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, is not even seeking a third term in the November 20 elections. Unemployment is at 21% and the economic downturn there continues. Regardless of the fates of these leaders, several overriding questions remain. What will citizens need to understand in order to accept a significant change in lifestyle and prospects? After ousting one set of politicians will they then be willing to go through the pain of more austerity and elusive growth, or will each new government face even stronger opposition? Is there a realistic way out of this financial crisis that does not entail hardship for the people? Citizens do not appreciate experimentation. They value a clear road map they can understand: It has a beginning, a middle and an end. Conflicting opinions, the residue of a democracy, nonetheless breed confusion and a false sense that somewhere, someone is hiding the easy way out. People then search for scapegoats and saviors, identify conspiracies and blame the powers that be. Coalition governments alone will not be sufficient for people to get on board. A clear pan-European plan that will unite the continent should be immediately under way. The largest political groups, such as the European People's Party, the European Socialists, European Liberal Democrats and the Greens, to name a few, must come together with the EU Commission and undertake this challenge. The commission has been working on economic proposals to address the fiscal crisis and the economic governance in the EU. There are talks about treaty revisions. But there are also, concurrently, discussions about moving to a two-speed Eurozone. This only heightens insecurity and resentment. But there is some good news. Many of the unifying elements are already in place. Across the European Union there is consensus on the transition to a low-carbon economy, to create green jobs, protect the environment, invest in education and R&D and to manage resources more efficiently. The EU has treaties binding members together, and over the decades a strong European identity has emerged that helps citizens feel at home throughout the EU and adds value to their national identity and heritage. Sadly, the current fiscal crisis has wreaked havoc and obscured all these positive policies that helped make Europe what it is today: a modern society that provides political, economic and personal security to its many peoples. Europe has strengthened its democratic institutions, provided funding for its weaker members, incorporated new members after the fall of the Iron Curtain, given voice to its citizens and led the way in reversing the effects of climate change, the greatest challenge of our time. What Europe needs now is more, not less, Europe. In a world where size matters, Europeans need to re-start the engines and not allow the fiscal crisis or the markets to send them back to the days when borders, national enmities, national currencies and nationalism itself ruled the day. Today's world requires cooperation on every front, and the economy is just one more test we need to pass, one challenge we have to face in order to move confidently into the future as Europeans who are writing a new chapter in our common history. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sophia Kalantzakos.","One by one, leaders in Europe's troubled economies are falling, says Sophia Kalantzakos .

"(CNN) -- All federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico closed to fishing because of last year's oil spill have reopened, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Tuesday, one day before the one-year anniversary of the disaster. The announcement came as the administration reopened the final 1,041 square miles of waters immediately surrounding the Deepwater Horizon wellhead, just east of Louisiana. No oil or sheen has been found in the area since August 4, NOAA said in a statement. NOAA sampled the area in November, March and April for potentially affected fin fish, including tuna, swordfish and escolar. The analysis of samples found ""no detectable oil or dispersant odors or flavors, and results of chemical analysis for oil-related compounds and dispersants well below the levels of concern,"" the statement said. The decision to reopen the waters was made after consultation with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. ""Throughout this process, public health and safety has been our primary goal,"" said FDA Commissioner Margaret A. Hamburg. ""This has been an extraordinary team effort and the reopening of these federal waters serves as a dramatic example of what cooperation between federal agencies can accomplish."" The April 20 explosion on the Deepwater Horizon led to the worst oil spill in U.S. history, with more than 200 million gallons of oil released into the Gulf. At its peak in June, 37 percent of Gulf waters, or 88,522 square miles, were closed to fishing. Also Tuesday, Omega Protein Corp. announced the final settlement of its claims for costs and damages incurred as a result of the spill. In total, the company received payments of nearly $45 million from the Gulf Coast Claims Facility, it said.","The move opens all federal waters formerly closed because of the Gulf oil spill .

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Back from the Memorial Day weekend, I'm Carl Azuz and this is CNN Student News! It's a short week for us. It's also our last week of the school year, so let's go ahead and get started. First Up: Remembering the Fallen . AZUZ: First up, Americans pause to honor service members who gave everything they had. Memorial Day is a tribute to the men and women who lost their lives while serving in the U.S. Armed Forces. Ceremonies were held around the country yesterday, President Obama helping lead the ones at Arlington National Cemetery. He laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns and later visited Arlington's Section 60; it's a site that's primarily for soldiers killed in Iraq and Afghanistan. During a speech, the president said the courage, unselfishness and devotion to duty of the servicemen and women who gave their lives is what has sustained the country. President Obama also said that Memorial Day is about the families who have lost loved ones serving in the military. The wife of a fallen service member said she sees Memorial Day as a chance to celebrate her husband's life. NICKI BUNTING, WIDOW OF FALLEN SERVICEMAN: I want everyone to realize that these aren't just graves; they aren't just numbers. They're real people, and they had real families. They had wives and husbands and children and parents and siblings and friends. And so, that's what today is about, just celebrating their life and making sure that everyone knows that these are real people that we've lost. And so, when I get to talk about my husband, I love to laugh and smile when I talk about him and really share the great guy he was. AZUZ: For the past 40 years, the 3rd U.S. Infantry has had a special assignment. They're the ones who place flags on every gravestone at Arlington Cemetery for Memorial Day. That's more than 250,000 flags! In this next report, two members share why they consider this responsibility an honor. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SERGEANT CHERRY SMITH, IRAQ WAR VETERAN: Now that I've actually served and came from Iraq, they paved the way. So, without them, we wouldn't be here. STAFF SERGEANT BRADLEY FALLS, AFGHANISTAN WAR VETERAN: It's especially an honor for us when you've been on the other side of it, and now you can come here and you can bring honor to their final resting place. Most of the leaders here are combat vets. They are coming from other units. They've deployed before. We all know somebody buried here personally. SMITH: I thank them. I give thanks all the time for just doing what they did. There's so many of us that have fear of doing what they did. FALLS: During our fifteen months, my battalion lost 24 soldiers and our brigade lost, I believe, 44. We have three 173rd members buried here, to include my platoon leader, First Lieutenant Benjamin Hall. I try to visit him on special occasions, you know, his birthday or his passing. I usually sit down for a while and talk to him, let him know how things are going, how life is, and how much I appreciate his sacrifice and his leadership while we had it. He was a great man. Sometimes it's a bit of a remembrance of good times and bad. You know, you've got comrades in arms that have died and you feel for them and you feel for your families, but you try to put that aside to give honor to those that you can. (END VIDEO CLIP) Is this legit? STAN CASE, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit? More tornadoes strike the U.S. than any other country. This is true. The U.S. averages more than 1,000 recorded tornadoes every year. Tornado Devastation . AZUZ: We've talked about a string of tornadoes hitting across parts of the U.S. recently. One of the deadliest in U.S. history struck Joplin, Missouri. Officials say this massive storm tore a 13-mile path across the city. Recovery efforts are getting started, and the president visited the area over the weekend. Dan Lothian has the details on that trip. (BEGIN VIDEO) DAN LOTHIAN, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Before touching down, Air Force One flew over Joplin, Missouri, giving the president an aerial view of the devastation. What took months and years to build was destroyed in a few moments: homes, businesses and anything else in the tornado's path. On the ground, it was a somber president surveying the breathtaking damage up close. Meeting with officials, survivors, and promising not to abandon this city. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: What I've been telling every family that I've met here is we're going to be here long after the cameras leave. We are not going to stop until Joplin is fully back on its feet. LOTHIAN: There is plenty of pain here, but also plenty of hope. Roadways were lined with thousands of people, some waving flags or holding signs with messages like ""God bless Joplin."" At a memorial service on the campus of Missouri Southern State University, that escaped the tornado's wrath... OBAMA: We will be with you every step of the way. We're not going anywhere. LOTHIAN: ...President Obama thanked the people of Joplin for their courage. OBAMA: You've banded together. You have come to each other's aid. You've demonstrated a simple truth: that amid heartbreak and tragedy, no one is a stranger. Everybody is a brother. Everybody is a sister. LOTHIAN: Recovering from one of the worst natural disasters in U.S. history will not happen overnight, but Missouri Governor Jay Nixon is optimistic about the future. GOVERNOR JAY NIXON, MISSOURI: Joplin will look different, and more different still in two years and three and five. And as the years pass, the moral of our story will be the same: love thy neighbor. God bless. LOTHIAN: President Obama also had a message for people across the country, urging them to get involved by supporting organizations such as the Red Cross, which is providing food and shelter for all of the people who have been displaced by the tornado. Dan Lothian, CNN, Joplin, Missouri. (END VIDEO) Texas Wildfires . AZUZ: Moving southwest to Texas now, where officials and emergency workers are battling a different kind of natural disaster: wildfires. In fact, this has been one of the worst wildfire seasons in Texas history. Two blazes around the city of Amarillo forced hundreds of people to leave their homes this weekend. They were starting to come back yesterday as firefighters got the majority of those flames under control. Dry and windy conditions are spreading the flames, though, and that is what the weather's been like in Texas for a while now. This video, another wildfire, is from more than a month ago. In total, hundreds of homes have burned; millions of acres of land have been scorched by these wildfires. Shoutout . MICHELLE WRIGHT, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mr. Sommer's and Ms. Bensfield's students at Nichols Middle School in Evanston, Illinois! How many launches are left in the NASA space shuttle program? You know what to do! Is it: A) 0, B) 1, C) 2 or D) 3? Start the countdown at three seconds -- GO! Atlantis is scheduled to make the next -- and last -- shuttle launch in July. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Endeavour Undocks . AZUZ: Atlantis will be dropping off supplies and spare parts to the international space station. That's scheduled to be the last shuttle mission. But the current one isn't over yet. It's getting close, though. This was the scene on Sunday, when the space shuttle Endeavour undocked from the ISS. It had been connected to the orbiting outpost for more than a week and a half. Now, Endeavour is on its way home. The shuttle is scheduled to land around 2:30 a.m. on Wednesday. That'll wrap up its 16-day mission to space. And once it's back on the ground, Endeavour will head off into retirement. Web Promo . AZUZ: We are not retiring, but we are wrapping up the school year this week. Doesn't mean we're going anywhere, and neither is CNNStudentNews.com. We're planning to have special shows on our site all summer long, plus new blog posts. So, make us your home page and check out what we're up to while you're on break. You know the address: CNNStudentNews.com! Before We Go . AZUZ: Before we go, hope you're not afraid of heights. For example, a pair of intersecting tight ropes over a giant canyon. Apparently the young lady you're about to see right here has no fear. Or, she just knows it's all an optical illusion. It's actually the world's largest 3D painting. It's on a street in China. But it looks real enough that some people said they actually felt dizzy when they were standing on top of it. When it comes to this kind of artwork... Goodbye . AZUZ: ...That sounds like the highest of compliments. And it proves that the artist should have no illusions about the quality of his work. I think you see what we mean. Hope you have a great day. For CNN Student News, I'm Carl Azuz.","Learn about some of the ceremonies associated with Memorial Day .

"(CNN)  -- [Updated 3 p.m. ET, Monday, August 29] These beachgoers are enjoying themselves on Isola dei Conigli (""Rabbit Island"") in Lampedusa, Italy. Lampedusa is the southernmost part of Italy, in the Mediterranean Sea between the Sicilian mainland and North Africa. Since the Arab unrest began earlier this year, thousands of people from Libya and other parts of North Africa have sought refuge there. Contrary to its name, Rabbit Island is probably more renowned for turtles. It is one of the last remaining egg-laying sites in Italy for the endangered loggerhead sea turtle.

"(CNN) -- WBA world heavyweight champion David Haye has branded his IBF, WBO and IBO counterpart Wladimir Klitschko a ""robot"" and said the Ukrainian will ""malfunction"" in their unification bout in Hamburg on Saturday. Haye, 30, was talking at the final press conference ahead of the duo's highly-anticipated face-off, with tensions clearly running high between the two fighters. ""It's going to be fun to watch this big robot start malfunctioning,"" the London native told reporters. The pair were due to get in the ring in 2009, before Haye was forced to withdraw with a back injury, and the Englishman said he is happy the fight did not take place two years ago because he is now in much better shape. ""I'm healthy, my speed is ridiculous, punch power is there, and I'm just in a really good place,"" he said. ""I'm happy the fight's happening now and didn't happen a couple of years ago because I am so much more of a better fighter now."" Klitschko acknowledged his opponent was in fine physical condition, but the 1996 Olympic gold medal winner said Haye will be the 50th knockout victim of his professional career and that the experience will make him ""a better person."" ""I will knock your butt out back into reality, which is good for your future life,"" said Klitschko. ""You're going to become a better person, a better man, with better behavior and you'll be on time."" The Semey-born boxer was referring to the fact that Haye was 30 minutes late for the press conference, and Klitschko went on to say: ""He was late for half an hour today, we've all been waiting for you princess."" The tension rose further when Wladimir's brother Vitali, the WBC heavyweight champion, stood up and asked Haye whether he would be attending the post-fight press conference. ""Please, promise, in front of many journalists, that you're coming to the press conference after the fight?"" Haye responded: ""I'm coming for you [Vitali] after the fight, make sure you're there."" Vitali famously faced a British fighter in 2003, when he lost to Lennox Lewis by technical knockout after the end of the sixth round. Former world amateur championships silver medallist Haye has previously said he will retire before turning 31 in October, but ""The Hayemaker"" has also expressed a desire to defeat both Klitschko brothers before hanging up his gloves. British cruiserweight Carl Thompson defeated Haye in their fight in 2004, his only career loss in 26 professional clashes. Klitschko will be looking to avoid a fourth defeat of his pro career, having won 55 of his 58 bouts. The fight will take place at the Imtech Arena, home of Bundesliga football club Hamburg, on Saturday.","David Haye has branded Wladimir Klitschko a ""robot"" ahead of their fight on Saturday .

"(CNN) -- Are the world's top male players playing too much tennis? It is a question that has been asked frequently over the years, but recent comments from world number three Andy Murray, and former world number one Andy Roddick, have indicated the matter could be coming to a head. With a schedule that runs from the beginning of January to the end of November, taking in 65 singles tournaments, the ATP World Tour came under scrutiny like never before when Murray hinted that the world's top players were prepared to take strike action in an attempt to modify the calendar. ""We're only proposing small changes, a few less mandatory events and some more rest periods,"" said Murray. ""Tennis is in a great place right now but there are just a few minor things we'd like to see changed and we hope to sit with the ATP and other officials and discuss them. Two or three more weeks off a season is really what we are thinking of."" And Murray's comments were backed up by Roddick, who told reporters: ""It's a more physical game than it used to be, but the season is longer than ever. ""I don't think we're storming offices, but I think the sentiment is still there. We need to be smart about it and take our time and make sure that it's well thought out and not be kind of reactionary. But, you know, there is a discussion going on."" The absence of Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic from the recent Shanghai Masters indicates, in Roddick's opinion, that the demands are too harsh on the top players. ""They don't get their money this week. If they were feeling well and they weren't worn down, then they would be here,"" he continued. ""We're not getting away with anything by pulling out of tournaments. I feel like that's the way it's presented sometimes. That's just not the case,"" he added. The lowdown . Yet, despite the claims of both Murray and Roddick, the facts show that the number of singles tournaments has actually fallen over the last 11 years. In year 2000 there were 69 ATP Tour singles events, however, that figure steadily decreased during the last decade and since 2007 it has remained static on its current number. And, for those 65 events, there has been a significant increase in the prize money on offer from the ATP Tour, with prize funds set to exceed $90 million for the first time by 2014. So why are is there a perception that players are playing more tournaments, than ever before? Somebody who knows all about the rigors of the ATP Tour is Australian Mark Woodforde. The 46-year-old won a remarkable 67 doubles titles, many alongside compatriot Todd Woodbridge, with the duo completing the grand slam of all four major doubles titles. In addition to this, Woodforde also managed to win four singles titles, reaching a career-high 19th in the world in 1996, and has first hand knowledge of how demanding the circuit can be. ""When I was playing and performing well in both singles and doubles, the calendar issue was raised even then,"" Woodforde told CNN. ""What with Davis Cup ties, the Olympics etc, you never felt like there was any time to take a breather, it was full on. ""The weeks off were cherished. As an aspiring player, you play to gain experience -- and since you may not survive through to the end of a tournament, the toll is not as great on you physically or mentally. Losing first and second round matches can be replaced by simply entering another event to compensate,"" added Woodforde. ""Yet as a top player, you end up playing many more matches, the pressures are greater, you try to strike a healthy balance to prepare for excellence at the grand slams and it's a continual mounting of pressures."" The reaction . Woodforde also believes it a positive thing that today's players are campaigning together, although he does not necessarily believe reducing the calendar is the way forward. ""There is a fear that by shortening the calendar to accommodate players requests of resting at the end of each season -- their agents will slot exhibition matches in their place, which will be worth more financially to the player (and their agent!),"" Woodforde added. ""Perhaps there should a total blackout of all exhibition matches for a period of say four weeks -- and if the players are in need of some competition, they can go back and play some club tennis."" Another former player, and now commentator, Andrew Castle also believes the schedule is fine as it is. In his column in British newspaper Metro, Castle said: ""Players are obliged to play eight mandatory Masters 1000 tournaments, four 500 ATP events and the four majors, plus the World Tour Finals if they qualify. ""With pre-grand slam events thrown in, we are looking at a commitment of 30-34 weeks of the year. I am looking at it and thinking there isn't a lot to moan about. ""The players are under a lot of strain and the tour takes its toll -- but if your body is telling you something, listen to it and withdraw from the odd tournament."" The future . Since his initial comments, Murray has seemingly backtracked on any talk of strike action, telling reporters: ""When I said a strike was a possibility, I didn't expect that to be such a massive issue. ""It's so far away from being at that level. None of the players want to strike and I think we are maybe coming across as being a bit spoiled when I don't think that is the case."" The ATP politely turned down CNN's request for an interview regarding a proposed players' meeting, although ATP Tour spokesman Simon Higson said: ""The players should and do have a major say in how the game is run, which is one of the key reasons the ATP Tour was formed as an equal partnership between players and tournaments. ""We have regular discussions with the players, including very recently, and are always receptive to their input. It's important to let them have time to discuss and focus on which topics are most important to them and then we can work together on next steps and solutions."" Sporting strikes are not a new phenomena. In the last year alone there have been disputes in both Major League Baseball and NBA basketball in the United States, as well as the top soccer leagues in Spain and Italy, which have resulted in a cessation of play. Whether such extreme measures will eventually happen in tennis would appear unlikely at this stage, but what is clear is that some high-profile players are unhappy with their work-load and unless administrators, players and sponsors alike are all singing from the same hymn sheet, the current rumbles of discontent could become louder and louder in the weeks and months ahead.","The ATP Tour tennis schedule is coming under fierce scrutiny once again .

"Austin, Texas (CNN) -- The current squabbling between the House and the Senate on the payroll tax cut extension perfectly epitomizes why congressional approval is in the single digits. Highlighting this debacle, Newt Gingrich ends his first television ad in Iowa proclaiming that by ""working together, we can and will rebuild the America we love."" Expecting Newt Gingrich to work together with Democrats and Republicans to end the partisan deadlock in Washington is a bit like asking the fox to guard the chicken coop. When Gingrich entered the House of Representatives in 1979, he quickly became the leader of a group of insurgent conservatives whose chief aim was a Republican Party majority. Gingrich's partisan antics not only transformed the House, but the Senate as well. Washington has not been the same since. Even from his first term, when he tried to get Rep. Charles Diggs kicked out of the House (despite his re-election after being convicted of 29 felonies), it became clear that Gingrich would use every Democratic misstep and every legislative opportunity to portray the House in the worst possible light. It was only in tearing down the House that Gingrich thought that it could be rebuilt in the Republicans' -- or perhaps, his -- own image. To Gingrich's credit, the Democratic leadership was always ready to misstep and then meet him in the partisan mud. Whether it was his fight with Speaker Tip O'Neill about who controlled the television cameras in the House or his relentless pursuit of Speaker Jim Wright's sweetheart book deal, Gingrich would not back down from a fight even if at first it appeared the evidence was against him. Gingrich became a master at using the legislative process to achieve his political goals. This strategy from Gingrich's House days is, of course, well known. What is less well known is that members who previously served with Gingrich in the House spread these highly partisan tactics to the Senate. I am writing a book about these senators, who I call ""Gingrich senators,"" because they so seamlessly infected the Senate with the same hyper-partisanship that pervaded the House. Since Gingrich's first election to the House, 40 Republicans have entered the House and then moved on to the Senate. Twenty-two of them continue to serve in the Senate, including Jim DeMint, John McCain, Jim Inhofe and David Vitter. Their alumni include Rick Santorum, Phil Gramm and George Allen. These senators learned well the lessons that Gingrich taught them in the House. Jon Kyl, the first Gingrich senator to rise to an important party leadership position, had been a supporter of any and all tax cuts until Obama announced his desire to extend the payroll tax reduction. Kyl was among the first Senate Republicans to announce his opposition, not just to how Obama wanted to fund the extension of the tax reduction, but the tax cut extension itself. This, incidentally, is the same Jon Kyl who said in an earlier debate: ""If you want an abortion, you go to Planned Parenthood, and that's well over 90% of what Planned Parenthood does."" When confronted with the fact that abortions account for only 3% of the organization's work, Kyl's spokesperson claimed that his floor statement ""was not intended to be a factual statement."" When the Gingrich senators don't have the votes to get their way, they will use all aspects of the legislative process to bring the rest of the chamber to its knees. In the last Congress, the Senate took 419 votes on roll call amendments. The 19 Gingrich senators who were serving at the time introduced more than half of these amendments. Seven of the top 10 senators who introduced the most amendments that resulted in roll call votes were Gingrich senators. Endlessly introducing amendments has become another form of filibustering, which previously involved making speeches rather than introducing amendments. But when a stream of amendments couldn't defeat the health care bill, the Republicans offered up a ""stunt"" amendment, its sole purpose to create a perception that Democrats were voting against preventing sex offenders from buying Viagra in the insurance markets established by the bill. Tom Coburn, a Gingrich senator, introduced the amendment. Gingrich's strategy was successful in 1994 when the Republicans won a majority in the House and the Senate. The strategy was also successful in 2010 after John Boehner and Eric Cantor implemented it in the Pelosi-run House. The Gingrich senators are once again using it to try and take back the Senate in the 2012 elections. The chambers and parties may resolve their differences over the payroll tax cut extension, but it is unlikely that they will do so through the methods that Gingrich made popular during his congressional days. Furthermore, if we can predict the future from their past record, the solution is not likely to come from the Gingrich senators. The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of Sean Theriault.","Sean Theriault: Newt Gingrich's first ad in Iowa suggests he's ready to end partisan deadlock .

"(CNN) -- A man who allegedly gagged and bound his toddler's arms and legs with tape and posted a photo of her on Facebook is ""devastated by the situation,"" his attorney told CNN Thursday. Andre Curry, 21, is charged with aggravated domestic battery, which is a felony, Chicago police said. In court Wednesday, his bond was set at $100,000. ""It's our belief that after the investigation by the state and DCFS (the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services) is concluded, Andre Curry will be vindicated,"" said assistant public defender Anand Sundaram. Curry has no history of child abuse and the girl has not shown injuries, Sundaram said, adding that the family is cooperating in the investigation. The girl was being checked by a doctor Thursday for any injuries, whether old or new, he said. With the photo ""going viral on the Internet, things may have been blown out of proportion,"" Sundaram said. Sundaram gave few details, saying he could not comment on specifics of the case. The photo at issue shows the girl with painter's tape over her mouth and binding her wrists and ankles. Above the photo on Curry's Facebook page were the words, ""This is wut happens wen my baby hits me back. ;)"" The Facebook page appears to have been taken down. But the image was picked up by other websites. The Cook County State's Attorney's Office also told CNN that the caption was with the photo on Curry's Facebook page. Andy Conklin, a spokesman for the state's attorney's office, told CNN Wednesday the girl in the photo is 22 months old. ""The photo itself does not tell the story of who our client is and how well he takes care of this child,"" said Sundaram. He said his client will not face the felony charge if prosecutors cannot prove the girl suffered any injuries from the incident. If that's the case, he said, prosecutors could at most seek a charge of misdemeanor battery. Conklin said the next court date will be December 27. In the meantime, Curry remains behind bars. He would need to post $10,000 toward his bond to leave jail, Sundaram said.","NEW: The toddler was being examined by a doctor Thursday .

""There's 5 billion cell phones on the planet, but only 2 billion people online,"" said the director, whose new film ""Connected"" explores our increasing dependence on the electronic devices we carry. Shlain seems to have a love-hate relationship with technology. In the film's trailer she recounts a story of being at dinner with a friend and pretending to go the bathroom so she could check her e-mail on her smartphone. ""Everything is happening so fast. There doesn't seem to be a lot of time to really talk about what it is doing to us,"" said Shlain, who is also a founder of the Webby Awards. ""What does it mean to be connected in the 21st century? What's the good? What's the bad? What's the hope?"" Thanks to smartphones, people aren't just connecting through calls anymore. Increasingly, they're messaging on their phones through texts, e-mail, Facebook or Twitter -- streams of incoming information that are now accessible to us anytime and anywhere we have a signal. According to a trade industry report by the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association, the United States has 327 million cell phone subscribers, more than its 315 million people. Shlain believes her film presents technology as a next step in shaping society. ""These phones extend our desire for emotional connection. So these are all expanding human capacity because it's us evolving. We continue to want to have more ways to exchange ideas and connect,"" she said. But Shlain also thinks there is a darker side to our always-on, always-connected society. ""People have gotten incredibly rude. When you are with a good friend you should not have your cell phone right here like a ticking bomb. I think there should be no texting in funerals. When you walk in to greet your husband or partner, you should not be talking on a cell phone."" In the film, Shlain ponders what the lasting impact of this information explosion will be. ""I wonder if people are going to look back on this period and say, 'I cannot believe people used their cell phones so much in every situation and there were no boundaries,"" she said. In her own life, Shlain has taken action to limit her digital diet. One day a week, she and her family have a technology shutdown. ""All of the screens go off for 24 hours and it's the most delicious, long, wonderful day. I read, I write in my journal, I hang out with my kids and my husband and the day feels like four days in one. Then we all can't wait to go back online. It kind of helps you re-appreciate technology in a new way."" ""Connected"" is in limited release in the United States.

"(CNN) -- Jenson Button is relishing Sunday's Hungarian Grand Prix, as the McLaren driver returns to the site of his first-ever victory for the 200th race of his Formula One career. The 31-year-old withdrew from last weekend's German Grand Prix, won by his teammate Lewis Hamilton, after 35 laps with hydraulics problems, but Button is hoping for better luck at the track where he tasted success as a Honda driver in 2006. ""It's always fun coming back to Hungary as this is the track at which I won my first grand prix,"" the 2009 drivers' champion told McLaren's web site. ""After a premature end to my race at the Nurburgring, I'll be hoping for better luck at the Hungaroring. ""I can't believe I've already knocked up a double-ton of F1 starts because I don't feel a day older than when I made my debut back in 2000!"" Resurgent Hamilton triumphs in Germany . Button made his first appearance in the elite division of motorsport at the Australian Grand Prix in 2000 with Williams, and has since gone on to represent Benetton, Renault, BAR, Honda, Brawn GP and now McLaren in an 11-year career. The Briton has notched up 10 grand prix triumphs and secured his only world crown to date in 2009, while racing for Brawn. Button is hopeful of a strong showing on Sunday and is taking encouragement from his third-place finish at the Monaco Grand Prix -- a circuit he feels presents a very similar challenge to the Hungaroring. ""The MP4-26 [McLaren's car] was very competitive in Monaco a couple of months ago and I hope it will be a similar situation this weekend because the Hungaroring has many of the same performance criteria. Latest F1 standings after the German GP . ""Cockpit temperatures regularly exceed 50 degrees and we're always pulling g-force in the car because there are so many corners. It's tough, but this is definitely a circuit when all the training pays dividends."" Hamilton is also a previous winner in Hungary having triumphed at the venue in 2007 and the 26-year-old is eager to build on his success at the Nurburgring last time out. ""I've always gone well in Hungary,"" said the 2008 world champion. ""I like the circuit because it's old school. It has a very historic feel to it, with hills and bumps and cambers changes, and it has massive character."" Hamilton beat off fierce competition from Ferrari's Fernando Alonso and Mark Webber of Red Bull to earn a hard-fought win in Germany and he is anticipating another close contest. ""There wasn't much between McLaren, Ferrari and Red Bull in Germany. It's going to be fascinating to see which team holds the advantage next weekend."" Despite Hamilton, Alonso and Webber finishing on the podium last time out, all three drivers trail reigning world champion and current standings leader Sebastian Vettel. Vettel, 24, holds a 77-point lead over his colleague Webber at the top of the championship heading into the 11th race of the season.","Jenson Button is preparing for the 200th race of his Formula One career .

Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- Whenever someone at our office bitches about being overworked, our stock response is ""Beats digging ditches."" While the express intention of the statement is usually not-so-supportive, we think it's a healthy reminder that at the end of the day, we are all basically professional e-mailers and should be thankful for such. The wildland firefighters who work for Grayback Forestry in Medford, Oregon, have no such motivational adages because their job is actually digging ditches. Around active forest fires. On the sides of mountains. You can't even bitch at these guys for having cushy government pensions to fall back on when they get older, because they're all private-sector contractors. Which means if they aren't out fighting forest fires or doing preventative forestry on unburned woods (basically extreme landscaping), they are losing money. They are the hardest working men in the tree business. Southern Oregon in the summer is a tinderbox. Last year the state recorded some 560 wild fires, the majority of which occurred in the seemingly endless sea of trees running across its bottom from the Cascades to the Pacific Coast. Humidity is next to nonexistent, which is extremely pleasant, but means that even an errant spark from a chainsaw or the proverbial cigarette butt out the car window can set the entire region ablaze. Flying into the Rogue Valley, there is evidence of past wild fires is everywhere: From the miles-long scar of the 2002 ""Biscuit"" fire stretching past the horizon, to the smaller pockets of charred trees crowding the edge of towns to the blue Wilderness-Firefighter-ribbon bumper stickers flying past on the I-5 to the elaborate wildfire and firefighter shrines at a local bar. See more of Oregon Fire Lines at VBS.TV . There are very few places firemen aren't revered as local heroes, but the wilderness firefighters of Oregon go past people simply risking their lives to help others into a crazy superhero realm where their work regularly prevents entire settlements from being destroyed. They're literally the guardians of their communities. Incidentally, their work is also very beneficial for the forest. We spent a few days following a crew of Grayback forest-firefighters walk up the sides of what most people would consider a cliff, to chop down underbrush in preparation for a controlled burn. This is what they like to call ""project work"" -- the light stuff they do between fires. The work is the hardest and least rewarding work we have ever tried to do. Unless you consider 12-hour-plus shifts of backbreaking labor, virtually zero outside recognition, and occasional accusations of being shills for the timber industry rewards. Which we do not.

"(CNN) -- The Okavango Delta is one of earth's remote places; it is not easy to get to, and it is quite wild. Independent travel there is not for the inexperienced or the faint-hearted. There are few roads and those that exist are difficult to drive and navigate and subject to flooding and other hazards; communications are spotty at best and locations are distantly apart. Winning and losing on Botswana's Okavango Delta . The vast majority of tourists fly into camps in the delta, many from the town of Maun, which is easily reached by scheduled airlines from Botswana's capital, Gaborone (Air Botswana), from Johannesburg, South Africa (South African Airways), from Windhoek, Namibia (Air Namibia), and from Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe. From Maun, a host of bush plane companies fly tourists to the camps and reserves, most of which, including Kwara, are privately owned and operated. Most tourists make their arrangements through organized tour companies, and there is no shortage of tour operators in southern Africa who can arrange an all-inclusive visit. More resourceful travelers can save money by making their own arrangements using the Internet to identify individual camps, and arranging transportation and accommodations directly through them. The camps vary from luxury suites to basic pup tents, and prices reflect the differences. Kwara Camp is mid- to upper range, offering heavy canvas tents on wood platforms with full beds and in-tent plumbed bathrooms, full board and a host of activities, including overland Jeep safaris, dugout canoe trips and motorboat journeys that are included in the basic price. Less expensive camps, such as Oddballs Camp, feature simple pup tents on platforms, but can be hundreds of dollars less expensive. Some camps are fenced to keep animals out at night, while others such as Kwara are not (if the sound of a two-ton elephant or hippopotamus tramping through the bushes right outside your window unnerves you, you might want to opt for a fenced camp). Botswana is deliberately expensive, as the government wishes to limit the number of tourists who visit Okavango to lessen environmental impact. Rates during high season (July-October) can be twice as high as during low season (November-June). Try going during low season, just before or after high season, to maximize wildlife viewing but minimize cost. For most upscale camps, plan on US $900-$1,600 per person, per night in high season, and a low of about $700 in low season. For mid-range camps, plan on about $700-$950 in high season, as low as $350 in low season. For basic camps, looks for rates as low as $340 per person, per night in high season and $240 in low season. Most rates are all-inclusive, including lodging, food and all safaris and other activities. Tourists on tighter budgets might want to consider camps in South Africa, although they tend to be less wild and more tourist-populated. Large animals including lion, zebra, hippopotamus, wildebeest, elephant and others are abundant in the Delta, and while it is thrilling to see them, tourists must always remember, this is not a zoo. The animals are wild. But as long as visitors follow a few simple rules, there is little danger.","The Okavango Delta is difficult to access; most tourists arrive by bush plane .

"(CNN) -- Portugal will face Bosnia and Herzegovina for a place in Euro 2012 after the pair were drawn together in the playoffs to reach the finals in Poland and Ukraine next year. Portugal, coached by former international midfielder Paulo Bento, qualifed for the 2010 World Cup finals courtesy of a playoff success against Safet Susic's Bosnia Herzegovina, and the Euro 2004 hosts and finalists will have to repeat the feat over two legs. Portugal will have home advantage for the second leg on November 15, with the first leg set to take place on November 11 or 12. Three other ties were drawn at the ceremony in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev, with Croatia set to face Turkey in a repeat of the Euro 2008 quarterfinal.

Ireland will be making their sixth appearance in a major tournament playoff, having missed out on last year's World Cup when a controversial William Gallas goal, after an apparent handball from Thierry Henry, condemned them to defeat against France. The final playoff pits Euro 1996 runners-up Czech Republic against Montenegro, who are bidding to reach their first tournament since gaining independence in 2006. There are 12 teams already assured of their place in the competition, with co-hosts Poland and Ukraine being joined by reigning world and European champions Spain and 1988 winners Netherlands.

"(CNN) -- Manchester City may have announced losses of more than $300 million for last season, but the English club's massive investment in players is paying off on the pitch. Roberto Mancini's men remained five points clear at the top of the Premier League on Saturday after ending the unbeaten run of third-placed Newcastle with a 3-1 home victory. That briefly put City eight points clear, but second-placed defending champions Manchester United stayed in touch with a 1-0 win at Swansea in the late kickoff, halting the Welsh side's unbeaten home record. While City's record deficit casts doubt over the club's ability to adhere to UEFA's financial fairplay rules, Saturday's win -- the 11th in 12 rounds -- was a timely tune-up for the midweek trip to Italy. Mario Balotelli coolly sidefooted in a 41st-minute penalty after Ryan Taylor handled the ball, then the Newcastle fullback's error allowed City defender Micah Richards to double the lead before halftime. Sergio Aguero came off the bench to net a 72nd-minute penalty after Richards was fouled by Hatem Ben Arfa, having also scored for Argentina in Tuesday's World Cup qualifying win against Colombia. Dan Gosling scored a late consolation for the Magpies, who will lose third place on goal difference if Chelsea win at home to seventh-placed Liverpool on Sunday. Tottenham, in fifth with two games in hand, can also move onto 25 points with victory against visiting Aston Villa on Monday. City's focus is now Tuesday's Champions League trip to Napoli, which will have a big bearing on the club's hopes of progressing to the knockout stage of Europe's top competition. ""The feeling is good for Napoli. The team has improved a lot in the Champions League,"" Mancini said. ""But I know what we will find in Naples, they are playing very well at home. ""If we want to win there, then we will have to play better than this afternoon."" Manchester United will also need to improve at home to Portuguese side Benfica on Tuesday after battling to beat promoted Swansea, with striker Javier Hernandez scoring a close-range winner in the 11th minute after a low cross by veteran Ryan Giggs. ""They have a great home record so we had to make sure we defended well, and I think we did that,"" manager Alex Ferguson said. ""We maybe should have done better with the chances we did get on the counter-attack and near the end we could have had a couple of chances, but it was a good result."" Arsenal moved up to sixth, also on 22 points but having played two more matches than London rivals Spurs, after winning 2-1 at promoted Norwich, who dropped to 11th. Dutch striker Robin Van Persie continued his hot scoring run with a double that took him to a league-leading 13 this season after Steve Morison gave Norwich a 16th-minute advantage following poor defending by Germany international Per Mertesacker. Queens Park Rangers moved up to ninth with a 3-2 win at Stoke, as striker Heidar Helguson scored twice before the home side were denied a late penalty chance to equalize when Joey Barton brought down Robert Huth but no foul was given. West Brom claimed 10th place with a 2-1 win that left Bolton in the bottom three, while Everton moved up to 12th after beating visiting Wolverhampton by the same score. Sunderland and Fulham joined Wolves on 11 points after a 0-0 draw, with all three clubs hovering hovering above the relegation zone. The bottom two teams Wigan and Blackburn Rovers drew 3-3 in a fiery derby that ended with Yakubu leveling with a penalty nine minutes into time added on. It was the Nigerian striker's second goal of the day for 10-man Blackburn, having netted the opener after only 68 seconds -- his 100th in the English league. Rovers had David Dunn sent off for a second yellow card three minutes after the break, but Junior Hoilett made it 2-2 on the hour despite teammate Morten Gamst Pedersen appearing to pass the ball to himself from a corner.","Manchester City stay five points clear after Saturday's 12th round of EPL matches .

"(CNN) -- After two years of denial about the European periphery's solvency problem, European policymakers are finally, grudgingly, facing reality. They are recognizing that Greece is almost certain to default by year-end. And they have concluded that it is imperative to recapitalize Europe's banks and to erect an effective ""firewall"" around Spain and Italy to reassure markets that if Greece defaults, the crisis will be contained there. But it remains to be seen whether this recognition will be translated into credible and effective measures by the time of the scheduled November 3 G-20 Summit. If past performance is any guide, one has to wonder whether this will be yet another doleful instance of domestic political constraints, especially in Germany and France, resulting in a ""too little too late"" European policy response to an ever deepening crisis. How deep? Greece's International Monetary Fund adjustment program is in tatters. The IMF itself is now acknowledging that Greece's economy, which has already contracted by around 12% since 2009, will contract meaningfully further in 2012. And the IMF is also recognizing that Greece will not meet the IMF's budget targets for 2011 and 2012. As a result, Greece's public-debt-to-GDP level will soon rise to 172%, or more than twice the level that might be considered manageable. As if to underline how unsustainable is the Greek situation, in the midst of the deepest of domestic recessions, the Greek government is now being required by the IMF to undertake further painful fiscal adjustment measures to meet its ever elusive budget deficit targets. Not only is the IMF insisting that Greece introduce an unpopular property tax, but it is also asking a Pan-Hellenic Socialist, or PASOK, government whose very existence depends on public sector patronage, to cut public wages and to reduce public employment. Little wonder that social and political tensions in Greece are now on the boil. The IMF is acknowledging that the Greek government will need more funding to finance its 2012 budget deficit. This is inducing the IMF to seek substantially greater debt reduction from Greece's bank creditors through the ""voluntary"" debt exchange. As might be expected, the banks are resisting the IMF's proposal, and this could complicate the IMF finalizing its intended program review by mid-November. Mindful of the 2008-2009 Lehman experience, European policymakers are fully aware that a Greek default could cause real contagion to the rest of the European periphery. They are particularly fearful that a Greek default could engulf Spain and Italy, Europe's third and fourth largest economies respectively, which would pose an existential threat to the Euro. But despite these perceived risks, and reflecting domestic political constraints from electorates opposed to further bailouts, European policymakers seem to be in no rush to put a credible firewall in place. In particular, they have yet to come up with a concrete proposal to leverage up the European Financial Stability Facility -- the euro zone's temporary bailout fund -- from its present size of EUR 440 billion ($600 billion) to the EUR 2 trillion range ($2.8 trillion), that most market analysts think would be needed to shield Spain and Italy from the fallout of a hard Greek default. And responding to increased banking sector strains that both the IMF and the European Central Bank fear could tip Europe back into recession, European policymakers are proposing a coordinated European effort to recapitalize the European banking system. However, they have yet to come up with concrete proposals as to how they will increase the European banking system's capital by the EUR 200 billion ($267 billion) that the IMF estimates would be necessary to put Europe's banks back on a sound footing. Public differences between the French and the German governments on who should pay for the bank recapitalization are not encouraging. The late MIT economics professor Rudi Dornbusch famously said that in economics things take longer to happen than you think they will, and then they happen faster than you thought they could. Hopefully, European policymakers will now recognize that in Greece we are all too likely to be in ""the faster than you thought they could"" phase of the crisis. For if they do, we might dare to hope that they will act expeditiously in constructing an effective firewall -- recapitalizing their banks in a manner that will spare us from a Lehman-style crisis when Greece defaults. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Desmond Lachman.","Desmond Lachman: European policymakers finally facing likelihood of Greek default .

"Amman, Jordan (CNN) -- Clashes broke out between citizens and anti-riot police during a visit by King Abdullah to southern Jordan on Monday. According to eyewitnesses, festivities welcoming the monarch in the southern city of Tafileh, 180 kilometers (111 miles) south of Amman, turned violent when pro-reform activists were denied access to a royal event to launch a development initiative. Youths threw stones at security services who responded with force, according to eyewitnesses in the city, home to anti-government protests in recent weeks. Taher Odwan, Jordanian minister of communications and government spokesman, downplayed the clashes, denying media reports that the king's motorcade came under attack. ""A group of citizens attempted to greet the king and started shoving security personnel who responded back. This is something you would find at any event,"" Odwan said. The incident comes a day after King Abdullah's royal address to the nation announcing sweeping political reforms that political observers see as steps to place the country on the path to a constitutional monarchy. In a speech designated to mark the anniversary of the Great Arab Revolt, the monarch announced a number of reforms, including relinquishing his power to form a government to the parliament, a greater separation of powers and further constitutional amendments. King Abdullah's Monday visit came to announce $21.1 million worth of development projects in Tafileh, where protesters have recently called for the government's dismissal, the dissolution of parliament and greater efforts to combat corruption. Unlike other Arab states witnessing popular uprisings, weekly demonstrations that have taken place in Jordan -- a moderate state and key U.S. ally -- have called for regime reform, not regime change.","Youths clash with security forces, witnesses say .

"Washington (CNN) -- A Washington lawyer has filed a lawsuit in federal court, claiming he is the father of basketball star LeBron James. Leicester Stovell alleges that the athlete and his family have been involved in a cover-up to deny paternity by committing fraud and misrepresentation. He told HLN's ""Prime News"" on Thursday that he wants ""a carefully structured and secure DNA test"" to prove he's the NBA all-star's father. Stovell says he has been trying for three years to establish paternity and is seeking $4 million in damages. An earlier test ruled out the possibility, but he said the test could have been tampered with -- ""and there are indications that there was a motivation."" Stovell said he had sex with James' mother, Gloria James, after meeting at a Washington bar while she was visiting from Ohio in 1984. A few months later, she told him she was pregnant, but did not say whether he was the father. Stovell said his only request was that the child, if a boy, play basketball. He said his memory of the encounter resurfaced more than 20 years later, ""after being asked whether I had a son, and I then systematically explored all of my past for that possibility."" ""I came across this set of recollections and in focusing on them, they amplified,"" he said. In the complaint, filed June 23, Stovell says, ""I recently have concluded that a comprehensive, sophisticated and well-funded effort might well have been underway for quite some time, perhaps beginning in its present form as early as when defendant LeBron James was in high school, to frustrate identification of his real father, and that there is a likelihood that the father in question is me."" He stopped short of saying he is certain he is James' father. ""I don't want to make such a definitive statement in the absence of corroborative evidence"" such as DNA, he said. Stovell said he filed the suit two weeks ago because a statute of limitations was about to expire. ""I have some limitation considerations that caused me to want to file the suit before the end of June,"" he said. He denied the timing had anything to do with the current LeBron mania. James is scheduled to announce Thursday evening the team he has chosen to play for next season, a deal worth perhaps tens of millions of dollars or more. He currently plays for the Cleveland Cavaliers. He says he was informed by Gloria James months later that she was pregnant. He claims she told him the child would be named LeBron, similar to Leicester Bryce, Stovell's first and middle names. The lawsuit states Gloria James was 16 at the time of the alleged encounter, but Stovell said she told him she was in her early 20s. Stovell is a solo legal practitioner in the District of Columbia, and filed the lawsuit on his own behalf. A call to LeBron James' attorney, Frederick Nance of Cleveland, Ohio, was not immediately returned. The lawsuit had been filed without much initial publicity, but was reported by the TMZ celebrity website Wednesday. Public records show Stovell is a former government attorney with the Securities and Exchange Commission. He filed a lawsuit in 2002 against the agency, alleging racial discrimination. Federal court records show the case was settled when the commission paid him $230,000, while not admitting fault.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton took off her diplomatic gloves Thursday, challenging Pakistan to crack down on terrorist havens on its side of the border with Afghanistan. In a joint news conference with Afghan President Hamid Karzai, Clinton -- in unusually forceful language -- laid almost all of the blame for recent terror attacks on Pakistan. The United States, she said, knows the Haqqani terrorist network operates out of havens in Pakistan. ""We intend to push the Pakistanis very hard,"" Clinton said, calling it a ""time for clarity."" ""Our message is very clear: We're going to be fighting, we're going to be talking, we're going to be building,"" she said. ""And they can either be helping or hindering. But we are not going to stop our efforts to create a strong foundation for an Afghanistan free from interference, violent conflict and one that has a chance to chart its own future."" Clinton headed straight to Pakistan after her stop in Afghanistan, accompanied by CIA Director David Petraeus and Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. She is expected to meet with Pakistani officials, including Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani and Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar, to stress that transitioning to Afghan security is in the interest of Pakistan, senior officials said. Earlier Thursday, Clinton's focus was on Afghanistan, where she met with Karzai and other government officials for talks aimed at boosting reconciliation efforts in the nation. The top U.S. diplomat said she was working toward a peaceful Afghanistan. ""No people in the world deserve it more,"" she said. Shortly before taking off for Pakistan, Clinton told reporters that the death of Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi, which at that time was not confirmed, would ""add legitimacy and relief to the formation of a new government."" Her visit to Afghanistan followed a stop in Libya, the first by a Cabinet-level American official since the ouster of the longtime strongman. She landed under tight security as forces loyal to the transitional government continued to battle Gadhafi loyalists. Earlier Thursday, Clinton met with representatives of Afghan civil society, including human rights activists who address various issues including education, gender-based violence and youth empowerment. ""These are some of my heroes,"" she said as she greeted them at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul. Her visit comes as the nation pursues peace with the Taliban after years of insurgency. The effort suffered a major setback following the killing of Burhanuddin Rabbani, an Afghan political figure and former president who led the peace council. Rabbani was killed at home last month by suicide bombers posing as Taliban peace mediators. Clinton offered condolences to Salahuddin Rabbani, the oldest son of the slain leader, who was part of a roundtable Thursday. ""He tried to do the right thing,"" she said. The United States supports Karzai and recognizes the blow to the peace effort since Rabbani's assassination, the official said. In addition to the reconciliation efforts, Clinton also was to discuss Pakistan's relations with the nation and the upcoming Afghan transition. Coalition forces are in the process of transferring security control to Afghan forces ahead of a U.S. drawdown set to be completed by the end of 2014. The 33,000 additional American troops sent last year are scheduled to depart the war-torn country fully by September next year.

"(CNN) -- Dan Wheldon brought a bit of England with him when he began driving extremely fast cars in the United States. ""When I first started racing, a lot of the guys said that I raced with a lot of heart, occasionally not my head, but always with a lot of heart, like the way that Richard the Lionheart fought in battle,"" Wheldon wrote on a sponsor's blog in 2010. Wheldon placed a small mural of the 12th-century warrior king on his helmet in 1995, before he competed in America, and eventually released ""Lionheart,"" a biographical photo book. Sunday, Wheldon's fellow IndyCar drivers remembered the heart, competitiveness and growing maturity of the two-time Indianapolis 500 winner, who died in a horrific multi-car wreck at a Las Vegas event. Wheldon dies in 15-car pileup . A shaken Dario Franchitti, speaking after the canceled Las Vegas Indy 300, said ""one minute you're joking around ... the next, Dan's gone."" ""We can put so much pressure on ourselves to win races and championships and it's what we love to do,"" said Franchitti, who knew Wheldon since he was a child. ""And it's what we live for. And then on days like today, it doesn't really matter. I lost, we lost ... a good friend."" Franchitti recalled Wheldon's early IndyCar years. ""He was kind of brash, but he was a charmer,"" Franchitti said. ""He became this loving family guy. He was still charming, but he had this whole new side to him."" Wheldon's death must be a catalyst for change . Wheldon, 33, left behind his wife, Susie, and two young boys, Sebastian and Oliver. They live in St. Petersburg, Florida. Born in Emberton, England, Wheldon raced go-karts at the age of 4. His father was a go-kart racer and his mother was the timer at a local track. He was an IndyCar rookie in 2003 and won his first Indianapolis 500 two years later. Superstitious, the driver as an adult would tap his race car three times before getting in on the non-gear stick side, according to his IndyCar bio. After his second Indy 500 victory in May, Wheldon talked with CNN's ""American Morning"" about serving as a spokesman for the Alzheimer's Association. His mother was diagnosed with the disease in 2009. Sunday, drivers in Las Vegas did a five-lap salute in Wheldon's memory. ""Amazing Grace"" played as the drivers slowly wound their way around the track. The driver's father-in-law, Sven Behm, told CNN North Carolina affiliate WGHP that he told Wheldon to have a safe race. The competitor assured him vehicles, which routinely reached speeds in excess of 225 miles per hour, had been made safer in recent years. ""He wasn't just a great driver,"" said Behm. ""But he was a great human being. He was always very positive."" CNN ""World Sport"" anchor Patrick Snell said ""Dan Wheldon is a character. ... Extremely popular. Huge respect from his peers."" ""There is no question that the world of motorsports has lost one of its favorite sons,"" Snell said Sunday night. Twitter reaction to Wheldon's death . Wheldon's tragic passing on Sunday prompted some of motorsport's biggest names to take to Twitter in order to express their condolences and admiration for the British racer. Marco Andretti made his IndyCar debut in 2006 and the Andretti Autosport driver spoke of his admiration for Wheldon, using his official @MarcoAndretti account to say: ""I looked up to you both as a racing driver and a person/friend. You will be forever missed. RIP Dan Wheldon."" Will Power was one of the drivers involved in the multi-car crash which took Wheldon's life. The Australian Team Penske driver said: ""Such a sad day... to lose a champion like Dan Wheldon...my thoughts and prayers are with Susie [Wheldon's wife] and his kids."" Danica Patrick became the first woman to win an IndyCar race in 2008 and the 29-year-old tweeted: ""There are no words for today. Myself and so many others are devastated. I pray for suzi and the kids that god will give them strength."" Jimmie Johnson is a five-time NASCAR champion who survived a big crash of his own at the Sprint Cup in Charlotte, North Carolina over the weekend. ""My thoughts and prayers go out to the Wheldon family... My heart hurts for all of the IRL community,"" the Hendrick Motorsports driver said. Wheldon's compatriots in Formula One paid their respects, with 2008 drivers' champion Lewis Hamilton saying: "" As a British guy, who not only went over to the States but who twice won the Indy 500, he was an inspirational guy, and someone that every racing driver looked up to with respect and admiration. ""This is a tragic loss at such a young age. My heart goes out to his family and friends during this extremely difficult time."" Hamilton's McLaren teammate and 2009 F1 world champion Jenson Button also reflected on Wheldon's passing: ""I have so many good memories of racing with Dan in the early '90s, a true fighter. We've lost a legend in our sport but also a great guy... ""I can't begin to imagine what his family are going through and my thoughts are with them at this very difficult time."" Brazilian Emerson Fittipaldi is a former Indy500 winner and two-time F1 champion who witnessed numerous fatalities during over two decades in motorsport. ""I have seen many fine men/racers leave us prematurely over my lifetime, it is an unfortunate part of our sport Godspeed Dan Wheldon,"" tweeted the 64-year-old. The reaction was not just confined to race car drivers, with stars from across the world of sport using social media to pay their own tributes to Wheldon. Manchester United and England footballer Wayne Rooney said: ""Sad news about Dan Wheldon. RIP. News like this puts everything into perspective."" Miami Heat's two-time NBA Most Valuable Player LeBron James expressed his sadness at seeing a fellow sportsman lose his life in such a tragic manner. ""Prayers goes out to his whole family! I don't know him personally but he was well respected in his sport. We are all one GIANT family,"" tweeted James, 26.","Two-time Indy 500 winner was killed Sunday at Las Vegas race .

"(WIRED) -- The iPhone 4S is available on three major carriers, leaving potential buyers to wonder whether AT&T, Verizon or Sprint is the better network choice. Pricing plans aside, carrier quality is a significant factor in anyone's purchasing decision, and now consumers have hard data to help them choose: A just-released study reports AT&T is tops for fast data speeds, while Verizon is the most reliable when it comes to making phone calls. Sprint's main draw is that it offers unlimited, albeit slow, data. The study was performed by Metrico Wireless, a mobile device performance analytics firm. To test network performance, Metrico made 6,000 voice calls, conducted 8,000 data download/upload tests (both moving and stationary), and downloaded more than 21,000 web pages. The tests found that Verizon dropped calls 2.1 percent of the time, while AT&T dropped 2.8 percent of calls and Sprint lost 3.7 percent of calls. The average dropped-call rate for the entire mobile industry is 1.4 percent. Although Sprint dropped the most calls, it had the highest call quality on the uplink (outbound calls), while AT&T had the best downlink call quality (inbound calls). With regard to maximum data speeds, AT&T led the pack at 6,047Kbps, with Verizon a distant second at 2,371Kbps, and Sprint crawling in last with only 1,767Kbps. It's unclear, however, exactly where Metrico tested data bandwidth, and as any iPhone-toting San Francisco resident will tell you, data quality can be terrible in areas with high concentrations of tech geeks. The original iPhone launched exclusively with AT&T, which was the sole carrier of the iPhone until Apple announced that Verizon would also begin carrying the iPhone 4 in January 2011. Prior to the launch of the iPhone 4S, rumors swirled that the phone would land on Sprint, and ultimately proved true. Of the three carriers, Sprint is the only one that provides a true unlimited data plan. Metrico's results are consistent with what we found back when Verizon began offering the iPhone 4: AT&T offered better download speeds, while Verizon had better coverage. Another important stat Metrico found was that the iPhone 4S performed perfectly across all three networks when it came to data task reliability. In short, 100 percent of the time, the phone was able to complete web-page loads, stationary downloads, and stationary uploads. This contrasts with an earlier Metrico study from March 2011 that found Verizon had a higher download success rate when the phone was stationary, and AT&T had a higher rate while the phone was moving. So what's the bottom line? It looks like you're going to get a relatively positive data-downloading experience no matter which carrier you choose, if only because you will be able to download data. But if you value downloading material quickly, you should go with AT&T. If call reliability is paramount, stick with Verizon, and if you want to use a lot of data but don't care about speed, go with Sprint.

"KATHMANDU, Nepal (CNN) -- Pilot error caused the crash of a U.N. helicopter in March which killed 10 people, a Nepalese investigating official said Wednesday. A U.N. worker at the site of the March helicopter crash that killed 10 people in Nepal. The helicopter was traveling from a camp for former Maoist rebels in eastern Nepal to the capital, Kathmandu, when it crashed on March 3. The crew did not consult the weather forecast, nor did it plan a route before taking off, said Nagendra Prasad Ghimire, the joint secretary of the civil aviation ministry and part of the investigation commission. Once the helicopter encountered bad weather, the pilot's unfamiliarity of local terrain compounded the problem, Ghimire said, summarizing the commission's findings. ""He thought that, 'If I climb into the clouds, I will be safe above the terrain and continue to Kathmandu,'"" he said. Instead, the crew found itself unable to control the aircraft. But the pilot kept the helicopter on auto-pilot mode. ""The pilot should have manually handled the aircraft to rotate safely to the ground,"" Ghimire said. ""Unfortunately, he didn't."" The chopper crashed in a mountainous region near Bhawasa, about 145 km (90 miles) east of Kathmandu. The U.N. mission said three victims were Nepalese citizens. The others included four international arms monitors from Gambia, Indonesia, South Korea and Sweden. The air crew, from a Russian company, comprised of two Russians and one Belarussian, the U.N. mission said. The helicopter was returning from inspecting a camp for former Maoist rebels who fought a 10-year civil war to end Nepal's monarchy. More than 13,0000 people died in the fighting. The rebels signed a peace deal with the government in 2006, joined mainstream politics and won the most seats in April's election for the Constituent Assembly. The victory transformed Nepal from a monarchy to a republic after 239 years of autocratic rule.","Pilot error caused U.N. helicopter crash killing 10 people, probe finds .

"Colombo, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- Sri Lanka's response to a scathing United Nations report alleging war crimes and human rights violations has reached the president's desk. President Mahinda Rajapaksa received the 400-page document on Sunday night. The response, compiled by the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission, will be presented to Parliament, though Rajapaksa did not say when. At their president's urging, Sri Lankans took to the streets in May to rail against the U.N. report, which cites ""credible allegations"" that crimes were committed by both sides during the final stages of the country's civil war. A three-member U.N. panel recommended that Sri Lanka immediately conduct an investigation into the alleged violations of international law. Human rights groups have already alleged both government troops and Tamil Tiger rebels violated humanitarian laws and that thousands of civilians were killed during the war, which ended in May 2009 after the government declared victory. The rebels had fought a 26-year bloody separatist war that left thousands dead and large numbers of others internally displaced, according to the United Nations. The U.N. report concluded there were ""credible allegations, which, if proven, indicate that a wide range of serious violations of international humanitarian law and international humanitarian rights law was committed both by the government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE (rebels), some of which would amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity."" In the war's final stage, which lasted from September 2008 to May 2009, the Sri Lankan army advanced into an area of northern Sri Lanka known as the Vanni, where about 330,000 people were trapped by fighting. The report said the government used ""large-scale and widespread shelling"" that left many civilians dead. Some of the shelling happened in no-fire zones where the government had encouraged civilians to congregate, the report said. Government forces also shelled a U.N. hub and food distribution lines and fired near International Committee of the Red Cross ships that were picking up the wounded, the report said. The government also shelled hospitals on the front lines, some of them repeatedly, the report said. ""Most civilian casualties in the final phases of the war were caused by government shelling,"" the report said. A spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Ban hopes the U.N. report ""will make a contribution to full accountability and justice so that the Sri Lankan government and people will be able to proceed towards national reconciliation and peace.""","Sri Lanka produces a 400-page response to U.N. allegations that it committed war crimes .

"Washington (CNN) -- Prescription drug overdose is now the fastest-growing drug problem in the country, surpassing the number of people who overdosed during both the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s and the black tar heroin epidemic of the 1970s combined, the Obama administration says. The problem is so severe, the administration is releasing a plan to combat what it calls a crisis of epidemic proportions. ""The toll our nation's prescription drug abuse epidemic has taken in communities nationwide is devastating,"" said Gil Kerlikowske, White House director of national drug control policy. ""We share a responsibility to protect our communities from the damage done by prescription drug abuse."" According to the Office of National Drug Control Policy, in 2007 about 28,000 people died from drug overdoses. Most were accidental and were related to prescription drugs. ""Today, we are making an unprecedented commitment to combat the growing problem of prescription drug abuse,"" said Vice President Joe Biden as he announced the administration's plan Tuesday morning. ""The government, as well as parents, patients, health care providers, and manufacturers all play a role in preventing abuse. This plan will save lives, and it will substantially lessen the burden this epidemic takes on our families, communities, and workforce."" The effort, called ""Epidemic: Responding to America's Prescription Drug Abuse Crisis,"" is primarily aimed at cracking down on abuse of opioids, some of the most powerful pain relievers on the market. Opioids are a class of drugs used to treat chronic pain and include products like OxyContin, Vicodin, Darvon, Dilaudid and Demerol. When abused they can be highly addictive. Prescriptions for these painkillers have increased dramatically over the past 10 years. In 2000 pharmacies filed 174 million opioid prescriptions. By 2009 that number was 257 million. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, over the past five years, hospital emergency room visits linked to prescription drug abuse or misuse have doubled. ""Unintentional drug overdose is a growing epidemic in the U.S. and is now the leading cause of injury death in 17 states,"" said Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""There are effective and emerging strategies out there to address this problem. Support for this action plan will help us implement those strategies which will go a long way to save lives and reduce the tremendous burden this problem has on our health care system and our society."" The plan seeks to reduce abuse and drug diversion, educate both parents and health care providers, find better ways to dispose of unused pills, and beef up enforcement efforts by clamping down on pill mills and doctor shopping. The Food and Drug Administration will provide support by requiring an opioids Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy to determine that a drug's benefits outweigh its risks. Under this process, drug manufacturers must make educational materials on proper prescribing and disposal available to anyone writing prescriptions for long-acting and extended-release painkillers. The agency must approve all materials before they are released. ""Long-acting and extended-release opioid drugs have benefit when used properly and are a necessary component of pain management for certain patients, but we know that they pose serious risks when used improperly, with serious negative consequences for individuals, families and communities,"" said FDA Commissioner Dr. Margaret Hamburg. ""The prescriber education component of this opioid (risk evaluation and mitigation strategy) balances the need for continued access to these medications with stronger measures to reduce their risks."" Thirty-five states already have prescription drug monitoring programs in place that help track how prescriptions are prescribed and distributed by authorized healthcare providers and pharmacies. The program's main goal is to prevent abuse and diversion at the retail level. Under the new plan, agencies will work to establish prescription drug monitoring programs in every state. The Drug Enforcement Agency will be heavily involved in enforcement, recovering prescription drugs, and focusing on doctors who illegally prescribe and dispense these drugs. They will also target ""doctor shoppers"" -- people who visit multiple doctors to secure multiple prescriptions and pill mills. ""When abused, prescription drugs are just as dangerous and just as addictive as drugs like methamphetamine or heroin,"" DEA Administrator Michele Leonhart said. ""The more we can do to stop the abuse of prescription drugs, the more effective we will be in reducing the death, destruction and despair that accompanies all drug abuse."" A number of other federal agencies will also be involved in the effort, including the departments of Health and Human Services, Justice, Defense and Veterans Affairs.","Abuse of prescription drugs is reaching epidemic proportions, the administration says .

"Washington (CNN) -- Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood announced Monday that the Obama administration will push legislation designed to overhaul and upgrade America's aging oil and gas pipeline network. The initative is partly a response to a series of deadly pipeline explosions, including one last year in San Bruno, California, that killed eight people and destroyed 37 homes. A February pipeline explosion in Allentown, Pennsylvania, resulted in the deaths of five people. San Bruno's faulty pipeline was installed in 1956; Allentown's was installed in 1928. During a news conference in Allentown, LaHood called on the major pipeline companies to conduct a review of their oil and gas delivery systems to identify the lines with the highest risk. He also urged them to speed up the most critical repair work. ""People deserve to know that they can turn on the lights, the heat or the stove without endangering their families and neighbors,"" LaHood said. ""The safety of the American public is my top priority, and I am taking on this critical issue to avoid future tragedies we have seen in Allentown and around the country."" Among other things, the administration wants to increase the maximum civil penalties for pipeline violations from $100,000 per day to $250,000 per day. It also wants to increase fines from $1 million to $2.5 million for a series of violations. The administration also would like to boost the number of safety inspectors and improve data reporting to increase the likelihood of early identification of possible pipeline safety risks. The Transportation Department is planning to convene a pipeline safety forum on April 18 in Washington. The United States has more than 2.5 million miles of pipelines used for the delivery of oil and gas, according to the Transporation Department. CNN's Jeanne Meserve and Mike Ahlers contributed to this report.","Transporation Secretary Ray LaHood presses pipeline firms to upgrade aging delivery systems .

"London (CNN) -- With her cheeky grin and bright, mischievous eyes, it is hard to imagine that four-year-old Selsabeel Ageli has spent months wishing for the death of an elderly man. But the British-Libyan youngster has done just that, going to bed every night in recent months praying that ousted Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi would be killed. On Thursday, Selsabeel's wishes came true. The deposed tyrant was the reason Selsabeel never knew her grandfather, Libyan trade unionist Amer Deghayes. The family says he was murdered by the Gadhafi regime when her mother was a child, prompting them to flee to Britain. Within hours of the news of Gadhafi's death, Selsabeel and her older sister Bilquees, aged eight, and their parents were among a jubilant crowd of former Libyan dissidents celebrating noisily outside the Libyan Embassy in central London. ""My father was killed by Gadhafi in 1980 when I was five,"" the girls' mother, Amani Deghayes, told CNN as her daughters waved Libyan flags nearby. ""They never got to meet him, so I am so glad that my kids have been able to see that there is a happy ending to this story. ""I never thought it would happen, really. Now I just hope that everything works out, and that Libya can become a stable, free and democratic country."" That is a wish echoed by many of those who gathered at the embassy, amid the beeping of car horns and waving of flags, to sing, chant and wish each other ""Mabrouk"" -- congratulations -- over Gadhafi's final downfall. Mahmoud Al Nacua, Libya's ambassador to the UK, told those gathered: ""Libyan freedom fighters have finally succeeded in throwing the curtain on Gadhafi's crimes. ""Their brave actions have spared Libya and the world from any further suffering of his evils. Today Libya's future begins. Gadhafi, a black era, has come to an end forever."" Lockerbie victim's brother calls Gadhafi's death justice . Consulate worker Abdusalam Zbida told CNN he hopes to be able to return to his homeland to visit family for the first time in five years following Gadhafi's death. ""It is a big day for Libyan history,"" said Zbida. ""It will definitely help restore peace and security in Libya. I hope it will be a fresh start."" Others who have not been in London as long are also hoping to go back to their friends and loved ones soon. ""It's been a tough couple of months, but things are getting better,"" said Amira Elgardi, whose husband and parents are still in Libya. ""We have a three-and-a-half-year old son, and we decided that with all the gunshots and everything it would be safer here, but hopefully we will be able to go back soon -- Inshallah [God willing]."" Victim's brother writes: I have fought for this day . They and many others spoke of their relief that Gadhafi's long reign of terror in Libya is finally over. ""I'm so excited -- look, I'm trembling,"" said Sana Maziq, who moved to London from Tripoli with her three young sons seven months ago to escape the trouble there. ""We knew that Gadhafi was basically finished, but it is so nice to know that there won't be any more bloodshed."" ""We can't quite believe it,"" added her friend Aida Shebani. ""The regime had gone, but Gadhafi still made us afraid, so now we are so happy. The Libyan people really suffered under him, so we deserve this happiness.""","Dozens of Libyans gathered outside embassy in London to celebrate Gadhafi's death .

Another has furniture attached to the ceiling, another has coffins for beds, and still another has lion cages on stilts (the Web site claims that kids ""love to sleep"" in them). Then there's the Freedom Room, which resembles a prison, complete with a toilet next to the bed -- oh, that German humor! 011-49/30-891-90-16, propeller-island.com. A place to unwine'd . When they were owned by a Swiss château, the four enormous casks on the grounds of the Hotel De Vrouwe Van Stavoren in the Netherlands held the equivalent of 19,333 bottles of wine. Now, after some creative recycling, it's guests rather than booze that mellow out inside the casks. The richly worn and airtight oak barrels have two narrow beds, with a small sitting area outside. The grounds are quite close to tiny Stavoren's harbor, which was a major port in the Middle Ages. 011-31/51-46-81-202, hotel-vrouwevanstavoren.nl.

This LSD nightmare's three main buildings are Gaudi-esque concrete treehouse-like growths that appear as if they flowed organically out of the ground. Inside, the walls seem to dissolve into the floor, and right angles are avoided entirely. Each guest room is built around a different animal theme: the Eagle Room has a big-beaked bird standing atop a huge egg, while another has arm-sized ants crawling up the wall. The animal theme continues outside -- a large giraffe statue on the property contains a teahouse, and human-size ""spider webs"" are set up here and there. 011-84/63-82-20-70.

Hydrophobics should stay far from Jules' Undersea Lodge, named for novelist Jules Verne of ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"" fame. The 600-square-foot lodge, a former marine lab, is 21 feet underwater, close to the bottom of the mangrove-filled Emerald Lagoon, in Key Largo. You'll have to know how to scuba dive to reach your room, and guests without the mandatory certification must take a course at the hotel. Once you've reached the lodge, which sleeps up to six, you'll be close to angelfish, anemones, barracuda, oysters, and other creatures -- each room is equipped with a 42-inch window, so you don't need to be suited up to keep an eye on the neighborhood. 305/451-2353, jul.com.

The jet's interior was once able to hold up to 125 passengers, but there are few reminders left of its days in the service of South African Airways and Colombia's Avianca Airlines.

"(CNN) -- Lionel Messi ended his international goal drought to help Argentina make the perfect start to the 2014 World Cup qualifying campaign under new coach Alejandro Sabella on Friday. Real Madrid striker Gonzalo Higuain scored a hat-trick in the 4-1 victory over Chile but of similar importance was Messi's first strike in 16 games for La Albiceleste. Handed the captain's armband by Sabella, Messi made it 2-0 in the 26th minute after combining with Higuain to end a run going back two years and seven months. Messi replied in kind to set up Higuain's hat-trick in the 63rd minute, while Angel Di Maria laid on his clubmate's other two goals. Chile, missing injured key players Alexis Sanchez and Gary Medel, had pulled it back to 3-1 through Matias Fernandez on the hour. ""It was important to get off on the right foot and we did just that,"" Higuain said in quotes reported by AFP, having also scored a treble in his last match for Real. ""I liked a lot of what we did tonight. Now we have to keep this up."" Sabella took over from Sergio Batista after Argentina lost in the Copa America quarterfinals on home soil in July, and his next task is a trip to Venezuela on Tuesday. Venezuela's campaign began with a 2-0 defeat at Ecuador on Friday, with the Copa semifinalists' most-capped player Jose Manuel Rey sent off with 12 minutes to play for a second yellow card. Strikers Jaime Ayovi and Christian Benitez gave Ecuador a commanding lead inside the opening 30 minutes. Copa champions Uruguay made a perfect start with a 4-2 victory at home to Bolivia. Strikers Luis Suarez and Edinson Cavani helped make it 3-1 at halftime, while defender captain Diego Lugano netted his second goal with 18 minutes to play before Marcelo Martins' late consolation penalty. Copa runners-up Paraguay crashed to a 2-0 defeat away to Peru, who built on their third-place finish as striker Jose Paolo Guerrero netted both goals in the second half.

"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- Greek lawmakers voted to approve a new round of tough budget-cutting measures Thursday, despite a second day of angry protests in which one demonstrator died. Tens of thousands rallied outside the parliament building as lawmakers debated the unpopular measures, aimed at bringing down the country's huge national debt. After a peaceful start, violent clashes broke out between anarchist rioters and the police, and between the anarchists and some union demonstrators who wanted to keep the protest calm. Tear gas was fired into the crowd, while rocks and fire bombs were thrown. The protester who died was a member of the PAME workers' union, lawmaker Makis Voridis told parliament. Hospital officials told CNN he was a 53-year-old man who suffered cardiac arrest. The Greek minister for health said the demonstrator had been taken to an Athens hospital without a pulse and could not be revived, but he had no injuries. Earlier reports suggested he had been injured. Lawmakers approved the austerity measures by 154 in favor to 144 against, despite nationwide protests and a two-day strike that has gripped the country. The new bill is expected to lead to around 30,000 job losses and further cuts to wages and pensions for workers in the public sector. ""We have no hope. The only hope we have is the strength of the people,"" said protester Vagelis Filezis, a civil engineer, before the vote. He said Europe's leaders were trying ""to save the banks but they don't think about the people."" And he warned Italy and Spain, which are also facing debt crises: ""Look at us. This is where you will be in two to three years."" Organizers had urged protesters from all over the country to come to Athens Thursday, suggesting the crowd could be larger than the 70,000-plus police estimated Wednesday. Organizers estimated the turnout Wednesday at 120,000, which would make it one of the biggest protests in the country in years. Police said there were about 40,000 people on the streets Thursday morning -- fewer than at the same time a day earlier -- and about 3,000 police officers. The mood early in the day was good-natured, but when violence erupted later it was unusual for the fighting that broke out between different groups of protesters,as well as confrontations with police. On Wednesday, clashes between protesters and police in front of the Greek parliament building left at least six protesters and 15 police officers injured, authorities said. At least 15 people were arrested. Some marchers Thursday accused the government of planting troublemakers in the crowd to spark violence. ""They have never been caught,"" said teacher Thannasis Karametsus. ""Why not?"" Protesters aimed to shut down wide sectors of the country during the two-day national strike. ""Don't bow your head, it's time for resistance and struggle,"" marchers chanted in the capital Wednesday as they gathered for the union-backed demonstration. ""I'm here for my children and everyone else's children. Those punks in there have destroyed everyone's lives,"" said former railway worker Diamandis Goufas, 62, pointing at parliament. Greeks are angry at yet another round of planned austerity measures as Greece tries to bring down its stratospheric debt. Lawmakers are trying to cut government costs to reassure international backers it is doing enough to earn the bailout funds they have promised to pour into the country. European Union leaders are scrambling to minimize the effect of Greece's debt on their common currency, the euro. Over the weekend, finance ministers from the world's largest economies pledged their commitment to take ""all necessary actions"" to stabilize markets. They aim to keep banks well capitalized so they can weather the effects of any defaults by Greece or other indebted countries, such as Portugal, Spain, Ireland or Italy. But there appears to be a split between France and Germany -- Europe's two largest economies -- on how to do it. Germany has stressed that individual European states should inject capital into domestic banks that lack sufficient buffers. But analysts say France is opposed to this idea because it could jeopardize the nation's top-tier credit rating. European leaders are expected to hear concrete details about how the plan might work at a European Council meeting Sunday. European Union heads of state are widely expected to finalize the plan in early November at a meeting of the Group of 20 world economic powers. CNN's Andrew Carey, Elinda Labropoulou, Diana Magnay and Ben Rooney contributed to this report.","NEW: Greek lawmakers pass new austerity measures despite protests .

"LONDON, England (CNN) --     Editor's note: Watch Tarantino talking about the making of ""Pulp Fiction"" on The Screening Room podcast. To receive regular movie podcasts subscribe here. Quentin Tarantino's first trip to Sundance wasn't exactly a success. Tarantino's hyper-violent, super cool debut feature ""Reservoir Dogs"" scorched audiences and critics alike when it came out in 1992. ""If you do this in real life, they're going to fire your ass,"" scolded cinematographer Stephen Goldblatt, veteran of films like ""Lethal Weapon"" and ""Charlie Wilson's War."" The novice filmmaker was participating in a directors' workshop at the Sundance Institute -- the film trust founded by Robert Redford which also runs the Sundance Film Festival. Unfortunately, Tarantino's mentors were just not feeling his experimental approach. The following week, a new group of mentors arrived, including ex-Monty Python member and filmmaker Terry Gilliam. Tarantino and his editor steeled themselves for the inevitable disapproval: ""Then Terry Gilliam comes in and goes 'Oh, your scene. Just great!'"" recalls the director. He is talking at the Cannes Film Festival Cinema Masterclass, following in the illustrious footsteps of directors like Wong Kar Wai, Sydney Pollack and Martin Scorsese. ""It was just like, you know what, that's gonna be my career. People are gonna either really like me or they're really not and just get f***ing used to it 'cause this is the deal,"" Tarantino says. A second visit to Sundance in 1992 proved more fruitful. His debut feature, ""Reservoir Dogs,"" a sassy, hyper-violent gangster movie, was the hit of the year. French film critic and regular on the European film festival circuit, Michel Ciment still remembers the effect it had on him when it showed at Cannes later that year: ""It was a big shock. I remember it was the most striking new American film since 'Mean Streets' 30 years before."" Despite the impact of his droll, assured debut, Tarantino recalls being convinced he was going to get fired in the first two weeks of production. ""I just thought it was too good to be true. I couldn't help but think something like 'they don't let people like me make movies,'"" he says, laughing. Follow-up movie ""Pulp Fiction"" was awarded the coveted Palm D'Or at Cannes two years later, cementing his reputation as a movie-maker to be reckoned with. It was filled with the dark humor and bloody violence that would become known as Tarantino trademarks. The B-movie-obsessed director admits to getting a kick out of creating humor in inappropriate situations. ""I'm trying to get you to laugh at things you've never laughed at before,"" he explains. He cites his ""bigtime"" influences as movie brats like Martin Scorsese and Brian De Palma, as well as Sergio Leone and Howard Hawks. In person, he is a great raconteur and his expletive-littered speech is not a million miles away from the dialogue that's so central to his movies. ""I tend to think of myself as more of a novelist who makes movies than a director per se,"" he declares. But he dismisses his apparent love of language as a product of writing for acting classes: ""I started writing as an actor and it was all about dialogue and writing scenes to do."" Before moving into directing, Tarantino studied acting for six years and says learning to act for the camera gave him an insight into how directors put a movie together -- frame by frame. That was what really taught him how to write for the movies. ""All of a sudden I started seeing [film] in a whole different way. When you start doing that, then it's only a few short steps until you start composing shots of your own,"" he explains. Tarantino has shown himself to be one of the most music-savvy directors of this generation with his use of songs like ""Little Green Bag"" by the George Baker Selection in the opening sequence of ""Reservoir Dogs"" and Nancy Sinatra's ""Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)"" in ""Kill Bill Vol. 1."" He, not immodestly, puts that skill down to his great music collection. ""The thing is, I have one of the best soundtrack collections in America,"" he boasts. That probably accounts for his scathing determination never to use film composers: ""I don't trust any composers to do it. I would just never give anybody that kind of responsibility,"" he says, ""Who the f*** is this guy coming in here, throwing their s*** all over my movie?"" And he admits that his inner film buff enjoys the cornerstones of action cinema that some of his later movies have explored. ""I love action scenes, but they are hard, and in a way that's what's fun about them. These cool little puzzles. To me, action scenes are some of the most cinematic moments that you can do in film,"" he says. ""Kill Bill Vol. One"" and ""Kill Bill Vol. Two,"" starring Tarantino muse and Hollywood A-lister Uma Thurman, are his movie-geek nod to the kung fu genre. When he started filming ""Vol. One,"" Tarantino hadn't made a film for six years and with typical chutzpah challenged himself to choreograph astonishingly intricate fight scenes. ""If I throw my hat in the ring with the greatest action directors who ever lived ... I wanna be as good as them,"" he asserts. He continues to work his way through his action movie checklist. In his latest movie, ""Death Proof,"" a homage to sleazy 70s B-movies that stars Kurt Russell as a murderous stuntman, he puts his own spin on another of action film's fundamentals -- the car chase. Tarantino is critical of CGI being used so much in film today. All the seat-grippingly tense stunts in ""Death Proof"" are real and he specifically cast a stuntwoman, Zoe Bell, in one of the leading roles to achieve this. It may have been ambitious, but ""Death Proof,"" which is one half of ""Grindhouse,"" a B-movie-referencing double bill he made with fellow director Robert Rodriguez, got a critical mauling and didn't fare much better at the box office. But then Tarantino has long been resigned to people either loving or hating his movies.","""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Kill Bill"" director Quentin Tarantino talks about his films .

"Mexico City (CNN) -- The helicopter crash in Mexico that killed Interior Minister Jose Francisco Blake Mora and all seven other people aboard shows no evidence of an explosion, a Mexican official said Saturday. ""In visual and preliminary investigations of the crash site, the remains of the aircraft do not show evidence of any kind of damage from an explosion or fire,"" said Dionisio Perez-Jacome, minister of communication and transportation. ""It is worth mentioning that according to the available information up until this moment, present at the place and time of the incident were layers of clouds and reduced visibility,"" Perez-Jacome said. His announcement on government television came as Mexico began a day of grieving for the eight killed Friday in the helicopter crash in a rural area just south of Mexico City. Mexican President Felipe Calderon and his wife were among the government officials at a public funeral in Mexico City on Saturday afternoon. The eight caskets were each draped with the Mexican flag on the vast green grounds of Campo Militar Marte where Calderon led a tearful ceremony of handing portraits of the eight helicopter victims to their respective families and children. A military band played sorrowful dirges, as did a drum and bugle corps at other points in the funeral. ""Here, in the earth, their example and memory will endure forever,"" Calderon told the black-attired mourners in the galleries and grandstand, all on their feet during the ceremony. ""These are difficult times for the government and for the nation, but it is also a time to show the strength to overcome these adversities,"" Calderon said. The Friday incident -- which occurred 2.5 miles south of the town of Santa Catarina Atoyzingo in the municipality of Chalco -- evoked comparisons to a 2008 plane crash that also killed the country's then-interior minister. That crash, in a luxurious Mexico City neighborhood, was later determined to be an accident caused by turbulence. The Learjet carrying the minister and others was following a commercial airliner too closely, authorities said. Calderon on Friday called Blake Mora ""a great Mexican who deeply loved his country and served until the last moment of his life."" Analysts said that the crash puts renewed attention on the president's controversial efforts to fight the nation's notorious cartels because the interior minister oversees domestic security. ""The national mood is such that even before this, people are alarmed"" about cartel violence, said Stephen Zamora, professor at the University of Houston Law Center who's an expert on Mexican law and U.S.-Mexico relations. ""Calderon is in the last year of his presidency, so Mexico is entering a presidential election year just as the United States is. President Calderon has been criticized because the number of persons killed has escalated during his presidency and so people see him as failed. I think that's a harsh judgment,"" Zamora said. ""He inherited a country, especially in the northern states, that is being destabilized by the drug cartels. He's started employing the army, which hasn't been used much domestically, to fight the drug cartels,"" Zamora said. While Blake Mora was well regarded by U.S. officials, his loss won't devastate the Calderon administration, said Pamela K. Starr, associate professor of international relations at the University of Southern California. ""I think there's an inevitability that there will be speculation that organized crime was involved in this, but it seems highly unlikely to me that indeed will be the case,"" Starr said, noting how the helicopter crashed under foggy conditions in a remote area. ""He was very highly thought of both within Mexico and with his counterparts in the United States,"" Starr said of Blake Mora. ""With that said, he has not been one of the central figures in the battle against drug cartels in Mexico. The lead has been taken more by the federal police and the president himself, along with the military and the prosecutor's office."" The helicopter went down in the Xochimilco area south of Mexico City, government spokeswoman Alejandra Sota said. Two other government officials were killed in the crash: Undersecretary for Legal Affairs and Human Rights Felipe Zamora and the ministry's press office chief, Jose Alfredo Garcia, she said. In July 2010, Calderon appointed Blake Mora to the post that oversees security efforts against drug cartels in Mexico. That battle has cost thousands of lives. ""I grieve his loss"" and those of the other victims, Calderon said in a national address on Friday, adding that Blake Mora, who was 45, leaves behind a wife and two children. Authorities will continue to investigate the cause of the accident. A photograph of the crash site depicts a relatively concentrated debris field. The French-manufactured Super Puma THP06 helicopter was made in 1987 and had logged 717 hours of flight, Mexican officials said. The helicopter crashed while traveling between Mexico City and the Mexican state of Morelos south of the city, officials said. The others killed were Diana Miriam Hayton Sanchez, the technical secretary of the minister's office; Maj. Rene de Leon Sapien of the Presidential Guard, who was Blake Mora's personal security detail; and three members of the air force: pilot Lt. Col. Felipe Bacio Cortes, Lt. Pedro Ramon Escobar and Sgt. Jorge Luis Juarez Gomez. Before becoming interior minister, Blake Mora was an attorney from Baja California state who was chief of staff to the state government from 2007 until July 2010. Previously, he was a councilman in Tijuana, as well as a state and federal congressman. Blake Mora was considered to be politically close to the president and, in fact, led his political campaign in Baja California. Ironically, Blake Mora's last writing in his Twitter account refers to the November 2008 accident that killed a prior interior minister. ""Today we remember Juan Camilo Mourino three years after his departure, a human being who worked on building a better Mexico,"" Blake Mora wrote in a tweet posted November 4, the third anniversary of the accident. CNN's Michael Martinez wrote this report. CNN's Esprit Smith, Mariano Castillo and CNNMexico.com contributed.","NEW: Rural crash area had clouds and reduced visibility .

"(CNN) -- As European consumers shift their drinking habits away from bars and into their homes, industry giants such as Heineken are looking at ways to adapt. Beer sales in bars and restaurants - traditionally the primary outlets for the Dutch brewer's products - have fallen sharply across the continent in recent years. As a result, Heineken recorded a 4.6% drop in sales in 2010, down to â‚¬7.89 billion ($11.3 billion). Didier Debrosse, president of Heineken's Western Europe division, is now looking for way to reflect consumer's changing needs as the company looks to arrest the drop. He has helped to implement a strategy he hopes will align the brewing giant with the demands of modern European consumers. A key component of the transition so far has seen Heineken move away from its traditional focus on bars and restaurants as primary points of sale. A series of partnerships and promotions with supermarkets such as France's Carrefour have been established - providing direct access to the home consumer market. Initial results of the link up are promising. Heineken recorded sales 3% higher at Carrefour stores than at any other outlet in the last year. The key is products which are easier to consume at home, such as a can to drink on the terrace, or a bottle to have with a meal. The aim, Debrosse said, is ""to cover all the consumer moments."" Debrosse is careful, however to maintain a long term definition of success. ""It is a journey,"" he says. ""It takes time to build a brand.""

"(CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama called Pakistan's president Sunday to express condolences over the airstrike that killed 24 soldiers near the Afghanistan border more than a week ago, the White House said in a statement. ""The president made clear that this regrettable incident was not a deliberate attack on Pakistan and reiterated the United States' strong commitment to a full investigation,"" the statement said. ""The two presidents reaffirmed their commitment to the U.S.-Pakistan bilateral relationship, which is critical to the security of both nations, and they agreed to stay in close touch."" The conversation between Obama and Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari was the latest bid to address strained relations between the two nations after a NATO airstrike killed the Pakistani troops on November 26. After the attack, Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani told CNN that Pakistan was re-evaluating its relationship with the United States. NATO later called the subsequent mass casualties caused by the strike ""tragic (and) unintended."" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta have called the incident a ""tragedy"" and offered condolences, though Washington has not issued a formal apology. The issue of U.S. and fellow NATO forces coming into Pakistan has been an especially sensitive topic in that country since May, when U.S. commandos killed then al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad without Pakistani leaders' consent . During an exclusive interview last week with CNN, Gilani said the country wants to maintain its relationship with the United States as long as there is mutual respect and respect for Pakistani sovereignty. Asked directly if Pakistan is getting that respect, the prime minister said: ""At the moment (it is) not."" ""If I can't protect the sovereignty of my country, how can we say that this is mutual respect and mutual interest?"" he asked rhetorically. Pakistan has taken several steps aimed at NATO since the attack. That includes an announcement Friday, by Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar, that NATO and International Security Assistance Force supplies could no longer be routed through Pakistan. The country has served a vital supply route for allied forces who have been fighting for more than a decade in neighboring Afghanistan.","Obama says the airstrike ""was not a deliberate attack on Pakistan,"" the White House says .

"(CNN) -- France striker Nicolas Anelka has been sent home from the World Cup in South Africa following a row with national coach Raymond Domenech. The French Football Federation released a statement on Saturday confirming that the 31-year-old had abused Domenech after being substituted during Friday's 2-0 defeat by Mexico, which left his team on the verge of elimination. ""Words spoken by Nicolas Anelka to the national coach, Raymond Domenech, are completely unacceptable to the FFF, French football and the values they defend,"" it said on its website. ""After being informed on Friday evening of the serious incident during halftime of the France-Mexico match, federation president Jean-Pierre Escalettes asked Nicolas Anelka in the presence of captain Patrice Evra to present an official apology to the French public and to express regret for his remarks to Raymond Domenech, the staff and 23 players from the France team. ""Upon refusal by the player to deliver a public apology, he [Escalettes] made the decision -- in full agreement with the coach and members of the official delegation in Knysna -- to exclude Nicolas Anelka from the group. ""He will leave the Team France camp this evening."" The French, who won the World Cup in 1998 and lost in the final four years ago, have been disappointing in what is Domenech's last tournament before standing down, with former Bordeaux coach Laurent Blanc to replace him. An opening 0-0 draw with Uruguay followed by Friday's defeat has left ""Les Bleus"" needing to beat hosts South Africa on Tuesday and hope that Mexico and the South Americans do not draw, in order for Domenech's team to progress to the second round. French media have speculated about dissension among the squad, with former star striker Thierry Henry reduced to a minor role as substitute and William Gallas reportedly unhappy about missing out on the captaincy, which was given to fellow defender Patrice Evra. Anelka, who plays for English champions Chelsea, has a history of controversy on the international stage, having declared in 2002 that he would no longer be available for selection after being dropped by coach Jacques Santini when he refused a call-up. He finally apologized to Santini in 2004, but missed out on the World Cup in Germany two years later. Domenech brought him back into the France fold in 2007 and Anelka played at Euro 2008, where France crashed out in the first round. He scored in the first leg of the World Cup qualifying playoff against the Republic of Ireland last November, and had been given the main striker's role in South Africa by Domenech but failed to impress in both matches. Meanwhile, England striker Wayne Rooney has apologized after berating his team's fans following Friday night's disappointing 0-0 draw with Algeria. The English players were booed as they left the pitch, having drawn for the second successive match, and Manchester United forward Rooney accused the supporters of being disloyal as he passed television cameras. English FA complains after fan enters team dressing room . ""Last night, on reflection I said things in the heat of the moment that came out of frustration of both our performance and the result,"" Rooney said in a statement issued by the English Football Association. ""For my part I apologize for any offense caused by my actions at the end of the game.""","Nicolas Anelka banished from World Cup after abusing France coach Raymond Domenech .

"Perdido Key, Florida (CNN)  -- Everyone here has a clear memory of what summer should be: . White sand beaches busy from sunup to sundown; the souvenir shop running out of bikinis, boogie boards, airbrushed sand dollars and decorative hermit crab shells; more stop than go on the two-lane road that cuts through the island; more bathing suits than socks in the wash. There should be a wait for martinis at The Jellyfish Bar, a wait for oysters at the Flora-Bama lounge, a wait for coffee at Lost Key Java, a wait for fresh snapper at Perdido Bay Seafood. It is summer in name only on this narrow band of beaches. After oil spilled from a BP well and flowed toward Florida's panhandle, almost no tourists came to stay. Residents are losing their jobs. They're learning it doesn't matter if the sand looks pristine at the moment; oil slick and tar balls could return at any time, and people are afraid. ""Bartenders are trained to hear people's problems, make them feel better, but every single person that comes in here has the same problem,"" said Marcus Story, who opened the Jellyfish here four years ago, and usually pays his bills for the year with money earned during summer but can't afford to this year. ""The stress -- they can't sleep, everybody's irritated, everybody's on edge. I'm tired of thinking about it."" Perdido Key, Florida, has a reputation as the place to unwind, a haven from bigger, busier Pensacola, Florida, and Orange Beach, Alabama, just down the road. Its name translates to ""Lost Key,"" and it's home to about 2,000 full-time residents, 3,400 rental condos and not a single hotel. More than half its area is taken up by undeveloped state and national parkland. Tourism is its greatest economy, and untouched beaches its best selling point. After the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded in April, calls flooded the cozy visitor center inside the island fire station. At first, tourism officials assured people that crude gushing from the well was a faraway problem. As oil began to wash up on other shores, they promised that the coast of Florida's panhandle was clear. When it crept closer, they confirmed only what they'd seen that day -- and that most condos were eliminating the cancellation fees. But eventually, the calls stopped coming altogether. More than 4,100 people came through the visitor center's doors in June 2003, its busiest recent year. In June 2010, only 1,446 stopped by. Boom and cleanup crews surrounded the shores. Local business owners braced themselves for catastrophic loss of income. Families wept while they watched reports that warned oil was coming closer. It was disastrous news for businesses that sustain themselves all year on their Memorial Day-to-Labor Day revenue. And it was the same story around the rest of the Gulf of Mexico, oiled or not: An analysis by Oxford Economics for the U.S. Travel Association said the spill could affect the Gulf's travel industry up to three years and cost up to $22.7 billion. ""I think we all envisioned Hershey's Syrup was going to cover the white beach,"" said Alison Davenport, who has lived and sold real estate on Perdido Key for nearly two decades. Perhaps thanks to wind, tide or luck, Perdido Key stayed mostly clear, even while massive tar balls washed up on nearby Pensacola Beach. The slick on the horizon receded within a few days, and sticky brown clumps were cleaned up quickly, quietly. Even now, the only obvious signs of continued cleanup are occasional daytime crews. In the earliest hours of the morning, well before sunrise, heavy pieces of construction equipment bathe the beach in red and white light. This was supposed to be a big year for the Key. Many of the homes, businesses and condos were freshly built or newly renovated after Hurricane Ivan destroyed parts of the Florida and Alabama coasts in 2004. The economy had recovered enough that rentals were filling up, and home sales were increasing every month. ""You could just feel it. This was it,"" said Davenport, vice chairwoman of the Perdido Key Area Chamber of Commerce. ""Everything you see is tough and had already been through a pretty strong test. We all had reason to think everything would be just grand."" Some blame national media for replaying early images of oil-soaked birds and boom-lined shores, which don't reflect beaches like Perdido Key's, they say. But even locals disagree about whether it's safe to go in the water. Tar balls still wash up on shore at times, and when cleanup workers dig a few inches in the sand, it's stained yellow by oil. On Johnson Beach, part of the Gulf Islands National Seashore popular with locals and tourists, lifeguards counted about 50 people on a late July morning and called it one of the busiest days yet this season. All summer, kids who grew up on sand castles and saltwater have been relegated to lawns and pools. ""No, you're not going in the deep water,"" Perdido Key resident Jeannie Hines called to her 6-year-old son as he splashed in the Gulf. After days of begging, they'd returned to the beach for the first time in weeks. But the kids had new rules: no deeper than their knees, and they had to be extra careful not to swallow water, for fear of ingesting oil and dispersants. There were no health advisories in effect, but signs and a flier handed out at the entryway told people to avoid the sand and water if they saw any oil. ""Normally they'd be all the way in, swimming, snorkeling. I'm still hesitant about letting them go,"" Hines said as she looked over the umbrellas scattered on the sand. ""I've never seen it like this. It's always packed."" As the unofficial end to summer draws closer, Perdido Key residents are looking for ways to salvage what's left of the season -- for business, and for themselves. To prove the state of the shores, the visitor center posts near-daily videos of clear, gentle water lapping against a perfect, empty beach. They tout discounted condo rates, shorter rental periods and non-Gulf beaches along the Intracoastal Waterway. They launched new pages on Facebook, and planned tournaments and festivals that might spark some interest. They proposed a campaign to give as many as 120 families a free place to stay on Perdido Key, but Florida tourism officials said it didn't follow BP's guidelines for how to spend marketing money. Still, they're looking for grants to launch the promotion, because they know crowds draw more. Even a Gulf Coast vacation planned for President Obama and his family in August could provide a boost. The summer that wasn't is quickly coming to a close. Kids are watching the school calendars, and workers are impatiently waiting for BP claim checks to tide them over. Nobody was spending much money on entertainment this summer, but most Wednesday nights, about 80 people gathered on the beach to pray for themselves, the community and the summer they've lost. ""What separates this from a hurricane is the idea that you can come in, clean it up and move forward,"" said Darren McClellan, senior pastor of the Perdido Bay United Methodist Church, who leads the weekly service by the shore. ""There are things in our lives we can't fix with a simple phone call or the writing of a check. ""It's that question mark -- we are as stable as the blowing wind."" McClellan said Perdido Key will struggle the rest of the year with money, stress and questions unanswered. But he expects to see a more gracious community at the end, one that survived the un-summer of the oil spill together. Still, the beach won't be the thing to carry them through; McClellan plans to halt his shoreside service in mid-August. Like everyone else here, he knows you can't expect a crowd after Labor Day.","Perdido Key, Florida, didn't see as much oil as other nearby tourism-driven places .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Jamaica's Usain Bolt is officially the fastest man on the planet as he set a new 100 meters world record of 9.72 seconds at an international meeting in New York. Bolt served notice of his immense talent ahead of the Beijing Olympics by breaking the world 100m record. Bolt was trimming two hundredths of a second off the record previously held by fellow-Jamaican Asafa Powell and for good measure relegated world champion Tyson Gay to a distant second. The 21-year-old had served notice of his excellent form by running a world's second fastest time of 9.76 seconds in Jamaica last month and he quickly took control of Saturday night's Reebok Grand Prix showdown with Gay, who finished in 9.85 seconds, still a personal best. Bolt gave credit to a big contingent of Jamaicans who were in the crowd to watch his feat. ""Just coming here, knowing a lot of Jamaicans were here giving me their support, it meant a lot,"" Bolt told the Associated Press. ""I just wanted to give them what they wanted."" ""He ran a perfect race,"" Gay said. ""I've got to take my hat off to him."" ""An awesome athlete,"" said Shawn Crawford, who finished sixth and witnessed history from two lanes inside of Bolt. ""The time shows it."" The lanky 1.95 meter Bolt had produced his previous best performances before this year over 200 meters and finished second to Gay at this distance in last year's world championships. With doubts over his starting ability in the 100 meters, Bolt was even pondering a move up to 400 meters in favor of the 100. But the record changes all that and with Powell, who is recovering from a chest injury, and Gay he will be among the favorites for the 100 meters at the Beijing Olympics. He faces a showdown at the end of June with Powell at the Jamaican national championshps. Also at the Jamaican event will be Veronica Campbell-Brown, who won the women's 100m on Saturday in 10.91, the fastest time of 2008. The start of the night was delayed by an hour because of threatening weather  the area and the meeting was briefly hit by a storm which left the track shimmering with a moist sheen ahead of the race of the night. Bolt was assisted by a healthy tailwind of 1.7 meters per second, just under the limit at which a record can be set. Copyright 2008 CNN.

"(PEOPLE.com) -- Theodore ""Teddy"" Forstmann, a veteran business leader and philanthropist who was romantically linked to Padma Lakshmi, died Sunday. He was 71. Forstmann suffered from brain cancer, his spokesman tells The New York Times. Although the famed billionaire never married, he dated ""Top Chef"" host Lakshmi, 41, over the last several years. Their relationship made headlines when she gave birth to now 1-year-old daughter Krishna in February 2010, which spawned speculation over the identity of the father. (Venture capitalist Adam Dell was later revealed as the father.) Forstmann was also briefly linked to Princess Diana. According to ""The Diana Chronicles"" by Newsweek and The Daily Beast editor Tina Brown, the two were plotting to wed in the last weeks of her life. Forstmann, who invested in companies ranging from Gulfstream Aerospace to Dr. Pepper, is survived by his two sons, Siya and Everest, brothers Anthony and John, and sisters Marina Forstmann Day and Elissa Forstmann Moran.

"(CNN) -- U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Arizona, who was shot in the head in January, reads aloud a portion of her upcoming audio book, her office said Thursday. Giffords has made what doctors call a miraculous recovery since the shooting at an Arizona supermarket, which left six people dead and 12 others wounded. After months of rehabilitation, she returned to the House floor in August and received a standing ovation. She has otherwise stayed largely out of the spotlight. Her book, ""Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope,"" chronicles the relationship between Giffords and her astronaut husband, Mark Kelly. It's the story of her rise to become a Democratic U.S. representative, his stellar career from combat pilot to commander of the Space Shuttle Endeavor's final flight, and the tragedy that befell their lives when she was shot. The couple wrote the book together with Wall Street Journal columnist Jeffrey Zaslow. Published by Scribner, the book is set for release November 15. The audio book is scheduled to be released the same day by Simon & Schuster Audio. Kelly reads aloud the whole book except for the final chapter, which is read by Giffords, spokesman Mark Kimble said. Illinois congressman's life threatened .

"San Francisco (CNN) -- Dozens of people, many tapping on iPhones and discussing the ""Steve Jobs"" biography, lined up at a shopping center here on Thursday. But these Apple fans weren't in line to buy the company's latest gadget. They were here to see ""Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview,"" a documentary of sorts that's now playing in a handful of U.S. cities. This particular screening of the never-before-aired interview with the Apple co-founder was set to be the final one at this theater, but producers extended its run after showings sold out. The film's interviewer, Robert X. Cringely, watched in the audience and answered questions afterward. The 69-minute interview with Jobs was taped in 1995 for a PBS documentary called ""Triumph of the Nerds."" The program aired only nine minutes of Jobs' statements. The master copy of the interview was lost in transit, but director Paul Sen had secretly kept a copy on VHS tape, Cringely said. After Jobs died in October, Sen went searching through his garage until he found it. ""It was the first time in 16 years he touched the tape,"" Cringely told the audience at Thursday's screening. ""It won't be lost for another 16 years."" After the movie completes its brief run in theaters, ""Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview"" will probably be made available online and on DVD, Cringely said. Over the course of one month while pitching the idea to Landmark Theatres, Cringely and a small team shot an introduction and tacked on a brief text recap that runs without sound at the end. The production is crude, as is the low-quality footage from VHS, but Jobs is captivating. He told stories with charisma, enthusiasm and his flair for dramatics. He spoke candidly and with emotion. ""He never sat for another interview like this, and what a shame,"" Cringely said. The interview shows Jobs as alternately witty, charming, cranky and bitter toward those he believed crossed him. At the time, Jobs had left Apple and was running a small computer company, NeXT Computer, that targeted the education market. NeXT was purchased by Apple the next year, and soon after, Jobs was again running the company he founded with Steve Wozniak in his parents' Silicon Valley garage. Cringely, then a technology columnist, managed to score a coveted interview with Jobs because NeXT desperately needed the attention and because Cringely and Jobs had a prior relationship. Cringely worked for Jobs in the early days of Apple, where he had turned down stock in the company for a $6-an-hour wage. The filmed interview drew laughs from the audience at several moments. In one instance, Cringely asked whether there's a hidden meaning when Jobs uses a nasty four-letter word to describe his employees' subpar work. ""No,"" Jobs said, it meant exactly what it implied, and he explained that the ""A players"" don't require him to ""baby their egos."" Jobs reminisced about his early days with Wozniak, including the time they made a prank phone call to the Vatican and asked for the pope. He also panned IBM and Xerox, and was particularly nasty toward Microsoft. ""The only problem with Microsoft is, they just have no taste,"" he said in a now-famous line. Jobs predicted the meteoric rise of the Internet, which he said would be especially satisfying because Microsoft doesn't own it. He also described how he runs a business and the difference between workers who specialize in process versus content -- an imbalance he said tainted IBM. Jobs was especially critical of John Sculley, the PepsiCo executive who he hired to run Apple and who later fired him. Jobs described Sculley as a corrupt marketing guy and a failed manager who was wrong for the job. He also expounded on the importance of a strong leader but added that companies are not just about one person. ""People like symbols,"" Jobs said. ""So I'm the symbol for certain things.""","""Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview"" is based on a 1995 interview taped for PBS .

"(CNN) -- We're in a time of flux, my friends. We're sandwiched somewhere between the lazy, crazy days of summer (BBQs! Impromptu trips up the coast!

If your boss chews you out for being late to work, just tell him you were volunteering. Don't have time to comb through Pitchfork . Fool your music snob friends with Band of the Day, an iPhone app that dishes out musical knowledge in easy-to-digest screen-fulls. Each day, you'll get a bevy of info on one hand-selected band: original interviews, streaming music, videos and more. If your friends still doubt your expertise, just cast about your brain for the name of some buzz band and express disdain. Works every time. Your get-up-and-go got up and went . The days are getting shorter, and, consequently, the nights are getting longer -- and damn colder. If the prospect of staying in and watching reruns of '90s teen television whilst swaddled in a Snuggie is seeming more appealing than pouring yourself into something fancy and hitting the streets, might we recommend buying a cat and just giving up? Maybe just check out Crowdmug, an iOS app that lets you trade cash for pics of the scene at local bars and restaurants -- thus checking out the crowd without leaving your couch. Other users collect the money you pony up to supply said photos. Or, you know, YOU could get off your lazy, sweatpants-encased arse and collect cash for your own snaps. Getting paid to go out? Dude, that's like being an escort -- without all the illegal stuff. Two heads are better than one . OK, so you're not a total recluse, but the idea of sacrificing TWO nights out this week (one for dating, one for hanging with friends) is making your brain weary -- all that planning, all the strain that semi-intelligent conversation entails. Check out DuoDater, a new dating site that allows you to go on double dates with your friends. Also, if you're not that loyal a friend, it's like two dates in one night -- score. Running on empty .

"(CNN) -- The cell phone video stutters as it records the movement of soldiers and Syrian militia on the streets from an upstairs window. A whispered commentary describes the scene. Another video shows vehicles riddled with bullet holes, shattered apartments, glass shards and concrete lumps mixed with patches of blood. In yet another, protesters flee as heavy-caliber weapons fire ricochets off buildings. All are scenes purportedly filmed in recent days in Homs, Syria's third-largest city. Security forces have sealed off entire neighborhoods; others are blocked by barricades thrown up by protesters. At night, street rallies take place in areas ""liberated"" from government control. The many videos uploaded on social media sites, as well as residents' accounts, suggest some neighborhoods in Homs -- at the heart of opposition to the regime of President Bashar al-Assad -- are beginning to resemble Sarajevo at the height of the Bosnian civil war. That resistance is now becoming more organized and armed. Army deserters calling themselves the Free Syrian Army are helping with the defense of districts opposed to the regime. Some opposition activists say it's time for the international community to declare a no-fly zone over Syria, as it did in Libya, to blunt the regime's overwhelming military advantage. (There is no sign that Western powers are willing to do this.) Confrontations are also taking on sectarian overtones that could lead to a wider explosion of communal violence. There have been sectarian shootings and assassinations of prominent local people outside their homes. Residents say the government has begun deploying largely Alawite militia in Sunni neighborhoods such as Khaldiye, Bab Sbaa, Bab DreÃ¯b and Bab Amro. Though Syria is majority Sunni, its leadership tends to belong to the Alawite sect. Homs has long been a divided city, with Alawites living in the south and a rapidly growing Sunni population predominant in other neighborhoods. Opposition activists claim that the regime is trying to incite sectarian strife in an effort to divide opponents and show what civil war in Syria might look like. Residents of Homs who recently fled to neighboring Lebanon, and don't want to be identified due to security concerns, say that sectarianism is neither endemic nor widespread, but admit that tensions between communities are increasing. They say that they want a united Syria but accuse the al-Assad regime of stoking sectarian flames. The unrest is not confined to Homs. There are daily reports of protests, deaths and clampdowns by the security forces in the suburbs of Damascus, in Daraa to the south (where the unrest began in March), and elsewhere. Army defectors who have reached the relative safety of Lebanon speak of exhaustion after months on the streets, in some cases being ordered to fire on unarmed demonstrators. CNN spoke to one soldier in a hospital in northern Lebanon. ""Too much killing, we were always in the streets,"" he said. State media report ambushes of security personnel by armed gangs on a regular basis, though other accounts suggest these ambushes may often be clashes between defecting conscripts and elite units loyal to the regime. Even so, the U.S. ambassador to Syria, Robert Ford, told Reuters last month that the military was still ""very powerful and very cohesive."" Against this background of growing violence, the Syrian economy is suffering -- its oil revenues declining just as government spending spirals. The government has announced spending will increase 60% in 2012 -- much of it going for subsidies as it tries to tamp down the unrest. Analysts say the state has little chance of improving tax revenues to cover this spending. International sanctions, including those against oil exports and Syrian banks, are adding to the pain. Last week, the European Union followed the U.S. in freezing transactions with the Commercial Bank of Syria, which handles all letters of credit for the regime. The Syrian economy is growing more and more isolated from international trade -- and sources of hard currency. Last month, the Syrian government banned a wide range of imports in an effort to save dwindling foreign exchange reserves, before the economy minister reversed the ban two weeks later ""due to the legitimate demands of citizens, as it had more negative repercussions than anticipated."" Many of those ""legitimate demands"" appear to have come from powerful business interests in Aleppo, Syria's second-largest city and its commercial hub. Its Chamber of Industry had roundly condemned the ban. Just how much Aleppo means to the al-Assad government was illustrated Wednesday, when a large pro-government rally there was broadcast on Syrian TV. Marchers carried the flags of Russia and China -- two countries that have resisted sanctions against Syria. Commentators say keeping Aleppo onside will be critical to the regime's survival. If the city's merchants and financiers -- the engine of Syria's beleaguered economy -- decide that the al-Assad regime is no longer viable, a key pillar of support will crumble. For much of the last seven months, opposition to the regime has been spontaneous and leaderless. Now al-Assad's opponents seem to be more organized and are opening some important doors. The Syrian National Council, which was formed in Istanbul last month, comprises both representatives of local committees inside Syria and exiled personalities, and includes Islamist and secular strands of opinion. Earlier this week, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu met with members of the Council in Ankara and advised them to work for peaceful change. But with every passing day, the prospect of peaceful change in Syria appears to diminish.","Opposition to the al-Assad regime is becoming more organized and armed .
Violence is also taking on sectarian overtones .
Along with the increased violence, the Syrian economy is worsening ."
"(WIRED) -- Apple is a powerhouse of ingenuity, patenting ideas as soon as an engineer can scratch them down on paper (or iPad). Around three dozen Apple patents made their way through the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office this week alone. Here we share three of the most notable -- one helps prevent cracked cover glass, another would deliver power to multiple devices with just a single adapter, and a third is a far-reaching location-based services patent that could keep Apple's competitors on their toes. First off, Apple has come up with a solution for keeping the glass on the back of your iDevice from breaking in the event of a fall. Obviously, the simplest solution would be to avoid glass screens altogether, but if glass is going to stay, it should be made more resilient. Apple dreamed up a tunable shock mount that would sit between the glass and the body of the device. This shock mount would inflate when the device's accelerometer senses that the phone or tablet is falling. An actuator within the device would suck in the cover glass as it accelerates toward earth, protecting it from damage. This technology could also be used to provide a water-tight seal. The patent also describes using alumino silicate glass, better known as Gorilla Glass, instead of normal glass. Gorilla Glass is already used in the iPhone 4 and 4S. Future cover glass could be chemically treated in a solution including potassium to help strengthen it further. As K+ ions replace Na+ ions on the surface and edges of the glass, the glass would have higher compression thresholds in those areas, making it less susceptible to cracking. Next up, Apple proposed an intelligent power adapter that could detect the varied power needs of different devices, and service them simultaneously. Today's power adapters typically convert AC current from a wall outlet to a single DC current that can be fed to your device. Because different devices have different power needs, you currently need a different cable for each new gadget you use. (Well, that's the main reason. If power cords and adapters were universally interchangeable, manufacturers wouldn't be able to reap additional revenue when these accessories eventually need to be replaced.) Apple's patent details an adapter that would have multiple, daisy-chained DC-to-DC converters (either in the adapter itself, or the cord or a connector), supplying power to more than one device. Alternatively, the adapter would have a relay that dynamically controls the power delivered to a device, and would only deliver juice to compatible devices. The third major patent that rolled through the USPTO this week was innovative back when it was first filed by Xerox in 1998. The patent involves location-based services, and could potentially be another tool Apple could use to crush other mobile competition (or at least get them to pony up some royalties). Apple acquired this patent in 2009 from Xerox, and on Tuesday the patent was reissued. The patent predates the mobile app revolution, and even the rise of major social networks, and is worded uncomfortably broadly. Here's the bulk of what it says: . ""A location information system that displays location specific information, the location information system, comprising: a receiver that receives location identification information from at least one site specific object identifying a location.Iadd., where the at least one site specific object is a beacon.Iaddend.; and a transceiver that transmits the location identification information to a distributed network and that receives the location specific information about the specified location from the distributed network based on the location identification information, wherein the location specific information provides information corresponding to the location."" Yes, patentese is an obtuse dialect, but if you could decipher any of the above, you'll know the patent describes what tons of apps and mobile devices already do on a near constant basis. Apple could, theoretically, start pursuing companies like Foursquare or Facebook for performing location-based services that fall under the patent's very wide umbrella. Is this patent really a threat to such companies? ""Apple gets interesting new patents all the time. I think this one is an example, but the moment of truth for any patent or patent portfolio is litigation,"" FOSS Patents' Florian Mueller told Wired.com over email.

"Surrey, British Columbia (CNN) -- Canadian authorities braced for protests expected to take place near Vancouver, British Columbia, on Thursday outside an event where former U.S. presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton are scheduled to appear. Amnesty International called on Canadian authorities to arrest Bush for ""war crimes"" while activists announced Occupy Wall Street-style protests of the economic summit in Surrey where the former presidents were scheduled to speak along with world finance experts. ""We would prefer his home country try George W. Bush,"" said Alex Neve, secretary-general of Amnesty International Canada. Neve said Bush should face trial for ordering the so-called enhanced interrogation, such as water boarding, of suspected terrorists. ""But the Obama administration has made it clear they do not intend to do that, so we are asking Canada to. We are not naive. It's an uphill fight but we feel we have a strong case,"" Neve said. Across social media and the Internet, activists called for an ""Occupy Surrey"" protest similar to demonstrations in dozens of cities decrying Wall Street excess. Several recent Occupy Wall Street demonstrations led to property damage and arrests. Authorities in Canada said they were prepared for potential clashes with protesters, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said. RCMP Cpl. Drew Grainger said in a statement the force is going to ""respect the rights to democratic and lawful protest and is approaching this event no different than other similar events with a potential for conflict."" The summit is taking place in Surrey, a city just south of Vancouver with a population of about 370,000. Organizers are charging about $600 a head for an audience of about 500 people to listen to speakers, including Bush and Clinton. According to the summit agenda, the two ex-presidents will share the stage for about an hour to discuss a variety of topics including ""new realities of the North American economy."" The talk given by the two presidents is scheduled to begin at 3:45 p.m. ET and will be closed to the media, organizers said. The government of Canada, a close U.S. ally, has not commented on protesters' calls to arrest Bush. But the country's Immigration Minister Jason Kenney told the Vancouver Sun newspaper the request was not being taken seriously. ""Amnesty International cherry-picks cases to publicize based on ideology,"" Kenney said. ""This kind of stunt helps explain why so many respected human rights advocates have abandoned Amnesty International."" Last month, protesters appeared at a Vancouver event for former vice president Dick Cheney promote his book.","Protests are expected at a Vancouver event with Bush and Clinton .

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of Cambodians packed a courtroom in Phnom Penh on Monday as three top Khmer Rouge leaders went on trial for their role during the bloody four-year regime in the mid-1970s. The U.N.-backed Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia has scheduled four days of opening statements for the defendants, who are all in their 80s. On trial are Ieng Sary, the former Khmer Rouge foreign minister; Khieu Samphon, the nominal head of state; and Nuon Chea, the prime minister, also known as Brother Number 2. The head of the Khmer Rouge, Pol Pot, was known as Brother Number 1. He died in 1998, long before the U.N.-backed court came into existence. A fourth defendant, Ieng Thirith, was ruled unfit to stand trial because she suffers from dementia and could be set free, prosecutor said. She is Sary's wife and served as the social affairs ministry during the regime. Prosecutors have charged the defendants with crimes against humanity, grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, genocide, homicide, torture and religious persecution. Under Pol Pot's leadership, the Khmer Rouge regime was responsible for the deaths of millions of ordinary Cambodians during a four-year reign of terror that was eventually halted in 1979 by invading Vietnamese forces. In 1975, the Khmer Rouge ordered people out of Phnom Penh, the capital, and other cities in Cambodia to work in the countryside. It is said to be responsible for about 1.7 million deaths, roughly a quarter of the population at the time. Its stated aim was to create a Communist utopia, but instead the regime forced Cambodians into what has been described as a living hell. Soldiers marched city-dwellers into the countryside and forced them to work as farm laborers. Those already living in rural Cambodia were expected to produce enough food for the country while teaching farming to those who had never done it before. The regime abolished currency, and considered anyone with an education a threat. It did not allow modern medicine, and it isolated Cambodia to make it completely self-sufficient. The results were disastrous: People died of starvation and disease as soldiers tortured and killed anyone suspected of being disloyal. In the end, virtually everyone, including the soldiers, became a target due to the leadership's paranoia.","The three defendants are all in their 80s .

"(CNN) -- Iraq has banned all Turkish flights from landing in the country in response to a dispute over millions of dollars owed by an Iraqi government oil company to Turkey. Iraqi transportation ministry spokesman Karim al-Nuri said the decision to block Turkish planes from Iraq, including the semi-autonomous Kurdish region, was in response to a similar ban in Turkey against Iraqi flights. However, a Turkish government official denied that Ankara blocked Iraqi planes. The official did say that Turkey warned that if Iraq's State Oil Marketing Organization (SOMO) does not pay the $3 million owed to his country, then the country would ban Iraqi aircraft. ""They owe the money and they wish to freeze Turkish flights ... Talks are ongoing. But the way out is for SOMO to pay its debts,"" the Turkish official said. Al-Nuri said Baghdad did not make ""a political decision."" ""Iraq will reverse its decision if Turkey reverses its decision, too,"" al-Nuri said. After years of the U.S.-led war in Iraq, Turkey's flagship carrier Turkish Airlines was one of the first international companies to begin direct flights to Baghdad. Increasingly, Turkey has grown as a major international gateway for commerce and travel to and from its Iraqi neighbor.","Iraq claims Turkey has banned Iraqi flights from landing .

"Managua, Nicaragua (CNN) -- Nicaragua's election officials have officially declared President Daniel Ortega's victory, but opponents are protesting the results. A report from the Organization of American States indicated ""irregularities in the elections,"" but supported official results saying that Ortega won re-election after garnering more than 62% of votes. ""A process is legitimate if the people feel that there wishes were respected, and that is what we are experiencing here,"" said Roberto Rivas, president of Nicaragua's election authority. But protests and clashes throughout the country after the November 6 elections have left at least four people dead and dozens injured, police said. According to a report presented by the Organization of American States' election observers, irregularities during elections included problems providing identification card to vote, problems in the accreditation of observers and imbalances in political parties present at polling stations. For opponents of Ortega, the report shows evidence of fraud. ""Obviously here transparency is missing. They didn't take a series of legal steps that they should have,"" said Eduardo Montealegre, a representative from the opposition Independent Liberal Party. The Organization of American States says its vote count echoes the official election results. But one local pro-democracy group says the problems the organization identified would equally impact their own tallies. ""It's not that the results changed on the way (to be counted), it's that the absolute power of the councils overseeing the polls did not allow any challenges,"" said Roberto Bendana, president of We Make Democracy. Last week U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland weighed in over reports of procedural irregularities and voter intimidation. ""Frankly, if the Nicaraguan government had nothing to hide, it should have allowed a broad complement of international monitors,"" she told reporters in Washington. Disputes over the results have caused confrontations between protesters and authorities, said Marcos Carmona, executive secretary of Nicaragua's Permanent Human Rights Commission. ""We have reports from different citizens about aggression on the part of the National Police,"" he said, including the deaths of a father and two sons. Last week a National Police spokesman said the three had died during clashes with supporters of Ortega's Sandinista party, adding that protesters had provoked clashes with police. ""As the National Police, we reiterate our call to the activists and directors of the different political parties, to not use violence and to express their positions through civic means, respecting, above all, the lives of others,"" police spokesman Fernando Borge said. Ortega was first elected as Nicaragua's president in 1984, and ran unsuccessfully in 1990, 1996 and 2001 before being elected again in 2006. He is known as an ally of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and was a public supporter of former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi during the Libyan uprising. But recently he has reached for the middle, making overtures to the business class and promising to lure foreign investors into the country. His third term is scheduled to begin January 10. But opposition representatives say they plan to dispute election results before international organizations. Journalist Samantha Lugo and CNN's Fernando del Rincon contributed to this report.","Official results say Ortega won reelection with more than 62% of votes .

"(EW.com) -- A remake, a prequel, and one woefully misguided bird-watching comedy couldn't take down Hugh Jackman and the robots of ""Real Steel"" at the box office this weekend. ""Steel"" punched up an estimated $16.3 million this weekend, marking a healthy 40 percent drop from its $27.3 million debut. As evidenced by the film's impressive 64 percent boost on Saturday, it appears that ""Real Steel"" is playing as an outright family affair, and that sort of appeal will help it achieve small drops in the coming weeks. Still, the $110 million Dreamworks film, which is being distributed by Disney's Touchstone Pictures, has a very long way to go before it's in the black. So far, ""Real Steel"" has earned $51.7 million in ten days. Paramount's $24 million remake ""Footloose"" managed to open in second place with $16.1 million, a rather lackluster result. Instead of playing like a hyped-up event movie, ""Footloose"" played much more like a typical dance flick. It attracted fewer dance fans than movies like ""Save the Last Dance"" (2001, $23.4 million opening) and ""Step Up"" (2006, $20.7 million opening), but it performed on the same level as ""Step Up 3D"" (2010, $15.8 million opening) and ""You Got Served"" (2004, $16.1 million). The film played best with women, who made up 75 percent of the audience, and older moviegoers, who composed 61 percent of the opening weekend crowd. ""Footloose"" earned a solid ""A"" CinemaScore grade, and strong word-of-mouth could help it dance its way out of financial trouble, but it will not be able to match the $80 million total that the original ""Footloose"" achieved back in 1984. In third, Universal's horror prequel ""The Thing"" didn't scare up many ticket sales this weekend, opening with $8.7 million. The film, which totes a reported $35 million budget, performed below Universal's expectations, becoming the latest 2011 horror film to not connect with audiences. Movies like ""Scream 4"" ($38.2 million total), ""The Rite"" ($33 million), and ""Priest"" ($29.1 million) have all struggled at the box office this year. Even ""Thing"" star Mary Elizabeth Winstead's former franchise film, ""Final Destination 5,"" performed unremarkably, earning only $42.1 million. The best comparison for ""The Thing"" is probably ""Don't Be Afraid of the Dark,"" which opened with a similar $8.5 million and finished with $23.2 million. Considering ""The Thing"" earned a weak ""B-"" CinemaScore grade and a sad $2,990 per theater average, that total is about the best it can hope for. George Clooney's political thriller ""The Ides of March"" held very well in its sophomore weekend, dipping only 28 percent to $7.5 million in fourth place. That decline is far less severe than Clooney's other recent political flicks, ""The American"" and ""The Men Who Stare At Goats,"" which dropped by 57 and 54 percent in their second weekends, respectively. Perhaps Clooney has made a political movie that's a bit more palatable for general audiences -- or perhaps it's just the Ryan Gosling effect. Either way, after ten days, ""Ides,"" which cost Sony $12.5 million to produce, has earned $22.2 million. If it keeps up the soft declines, it could become a serious Oscar contender. ""Dolphin Tale"" spent one last weekend in the Top 5, sliding 31 percent to $6.3 million. After four weekend's Warner Brothers' surprise 3-D hit has accrued a nice $58.7 million total. Along with ""Moneyball"" ($57.7 million after four weeks) and ""The Lion King 3D"" ($90.5 million after five), ""Dolphin Tale"" is one of the few box office bright spots since ""The Help."" The weekend's other new wide release, ""The Big Year,"" debuted way back in ninth place with $3.3 million out of 2,150 theaters. Fox spent $41 million on the Jack Black, Steve Martin, Owen Wilson bird-watching collaboration that wasn't quite a comedy, wasn't quite a drama, wasn't quite a competition film, and apparently wasn't at all enticing for audiences, who gave the picture a ""B-"" CinemaScore grade. Between the financial failure of ""The Big Year,"" and 2006â€²s ""Hoot,"" which opened to $3.4 million out of 3,018 theaters, maybe Hollywood should think twice about the appeal of birds at the box office. They don't always soar. In limited release, Pedro Almodovar's deeply creepy ""The Skin I Live In"" got off to a strong start, with $231,000 in six theaters, good for a robust $38,500 per theater average. Internationally, tastes weren't quite as refined, as ""The Smurfs"" finally passed $400 million overseas. 1. Real Steel -- $16.3 mil . 2. Footloose -- $16.1 mil . 3. The Thing -- $8.7 mil . 4.

""We worked until very late last night,"" says the 39-year-old in the rolling Colombian accent we've come to love from her character, Gloria, on ""Modern Family."" About the late thing? We'll forgive her, because this is one busy woman. Not only was she working on a shoot for CoverGirl (she is their new spokesperson), but she also just launched her Sofia Vergara for Kmart fashion line for women of all sizes. And she's in not one but two new movies (""Happy Feet Two"" and ""New Year's Eve""), while filming her Emmy-winning ABC show. Today, the seriously funny actress -- who is mom to her own ""Manny,"" 20-year-old son, Manolo -- talks about everything from dreading workouts to the plastic surgery she's so glad she decided not to get. Q: The tagline of your fashion line is ""Work what you got."" How can we work what we've got? Everybody has something. Somebody has a good pair of legs, even though her midsection is a little chunky.

Q: Was there a time you didn't love how you looked? Oh, of course! Not everybody's confident their whole life. For a long time, I thought that my boobs were too big and I was, like, 14 years old, and I already had these huge boobs. I was very skinny also. And now that I'm almost 40 -- we always have our insecurities as women. We're never happy! Q: Can you remember the day you started realizing, ""Wait a minute, I think I've got it going on!"" In Latin America we do learn to be more comfortable with our bodies. Women are not shy to be in a bathing suit, in a G-string. But I also did a TV commercial for Pepsi when I was 17 on the beach in a bathing suit. And after that, everybody was like, ""Oh my god, that body."" And you know, you start to feel a little bit more confident if you have people thinking that you're so fabulous! [Laughs] . Health.com: The hottest ways Hollywood lives healthy . Q: I guess it helps to have a cheerleading squad. Of course, of course! When I moved to America, I was more voluptuous, and I felt a little different. And one time, years ago, I remember my publicist [at the time] told me, ""I think you should just reduce your boobs because nobody's going to take you seriously here."" My mother almost had a heart attack. She was like, ""God is going to punish you! You can't cut your boobs!"" I don't regret not doing it, because now it's become a big part of Gloria. Q: What made you realize, ""I'm going to keep my body the way it is""? My mother screaming at me that God was gonna punish me -- what else do you want! [Laughing] . Q: Oh, right, that would do it! Are you anti -- plastic surgery in general? I'm not against it at all. But I think that you should go into it more thinking that you want to look beautiful than trying to look young. Because I don't really think that plastic surgery can make you look young. It can make you look prettier, but if you go with the mentality of being young, I think that's where accidents can happen.

Yeah, about five years ago I was auditioning with this body and the attitude of a Latin woman, and it didn't match the stereotype of the Latin women in Hollywood. I made it dark for a screen test and everybody really liked it. They didn't give me the movie, but I kept the hair color! Q: Do you ever feel like people stereotype you? Oh yeah, of course. But I don't mind it. I mean, it is the reality. I am a Latin woman: I'm voluptuous, I'm loud, I'm exactly what a Latin woman is [laughs]. I mean, what am I going to go against it? No. I don't think there's anything bad in being a Latin woman. What is it? That we are loud, that we are passionate, that we are voluptuous?

I mean, I cannot...it's like you saying, ""Which one of your kids is your favorite?"" I can't do that! Oh....God...[her voice is wavering like it's ""Sophie's Choice""] it's so difficult.

How does going through a health scare at such a young age change you? It changes your priorities. It's a good thing when it comes out with a happy ending because it does make you appreciate things more. But, you know, you live your life as healthy as you can. I was twentysomething and I had never smoked, I hadn't eaten red meat in years, so why did I have a cancer? No one knows. Q: What's your biggest health regret? You know what I wish? My face is so much better, because I've been putting sunblock since I was young on my face. Nobody ever told me that I needed to put it in my dÃ©colletage! And so it is more sun-damaged than my face.

"(CNN) -- Adidas, the brand loved for its sports gear, might be expanding into fashion but it won't desert its fitness loving fans, the chief executive says. Adidas is now working with top designers, such as Stella McCartney, to create a distinctive genre of sportswear and lifestyle fashion products. But while ceo Herbert Hainer is happy with the diversity the collaborations provide, its main priority will always be sportswear, he told CNN. ""Football is our heart and our soul,"" he said. ""This gives us a driving edge in Europe,"" he added. Adidas is an official partner of the European Champions League and the 2012 European Football Championship. This means its commitment to Europe will grow despite the continent's vulnerable economic conditions, Hainer said. ""Europe is still a huge market,"" he noted. ""Be it in the mature markets [France, Germany, England] or the emerging markets... especially Russia,"" he said. ""I am not concerned about Europe. There is no doubt that we will further grow in Europe,"" he added. Adidas has navigated the worst of Europe's economic difficulties thanks to the strength of its brand name and the diversity of its product portfolio, he said. The German sportswear giant has grown steadily throughout the first half of 2011 across all of its brand name titles, including Reebok and Tailor Made. Consumers are looking for innovative products and despite difficult economic times across the world, Adidas is delivering, Hainer said.

"Las Vegas (CNN) -- Weeks ago, Dan Wheldon was behind the wheel of a new prototype car for the IZOD IndyCar racing series -- one meant to make his sport safer, albeit ideally no less exciting. The two-time Indianapolis 500 winner, who'd been one of a handful of key collaborators in the safety effort as identified on the racing circuit's website, never got a chance to see the refined engines at work in a real race. Instead on Monday, his friends, colleagues and the racing world were mourning his death following a fiery 15-car wreck at the Las Vegas Indy 300. ""I lost one of my best friends, one of my greatest teammates,"" driver Tony Kanaan told reporters hours after Sunday's fatal crash. ""I know this is a dangerous sport. I know we're exposed to that every day, in normal life as well,"" he added. ""But you know, you don't think about it. Today, we have to think about it."" Images from the fatal crash . Had he won Sunday's race, the Englishman with the ready smile and engaging manner would have earned a $5 million payout. Instead, he was near the back of the 34-car field when he got mixed up in a crash that featured numerous cars spinning out of control and bursting into flames, spewing smoke and debris. ""All I could see was fire and parts flying and smoke,"" recalled Paul Tracy, one of those involved in the crash, on Monday. ""When it all came to a stop, it looked like something out of a movie set ... It didn't seem real."" An official at the Clark County Coroner's Office, who was not named per the office's policy, told CNN on Monday that Wheldon officially died from ""blunt head trauma."" The 33-year-old's death has been ruled an ""accident."" Two other drivers seriously injured in the wreck -- J.R. Hildebrand and Pippa Mann -- were released Monday from University Medical Center in Las Vegas, IndyCar said in a release. Mann had surgery Sunday night for a burn injury to a finger on her right hand, while Hildebrand was held overnight after suffering a severely bruised sternum. Championship contender Will Power was treated and released Sunday, IndyCar spokeswoman Amy Konrath said. The violent crash raised fresh questions about safety, both in motor sports generally and at the Las Vegas track specifically. Wheldon had been a driving force to address such concerns. In an early October story posted on IndyCar.com, the racing series' official website, IndyCar Vice President Will Phillips singled out the 33-year-old driver, his team and Italian manufacturer Dallara for their efforts to fine-tool a safer car model for the 2012 season. ""He's focused on what's been needed from him to provide for the feedback to Dallara and be consistent and concise,"" Phillips said then of Wheldon. ""You couldn't have asked for more."" Wheldon was known as ""a great family man"" Ironically, the new 2012 cars were expected to have components -- namely extra protection around tires -- to prevent spin-outs like the one that triggered Sunday's wreck when two vehicles' bump together, said Tracy. ""They want the cars to run a bit more in a pack, (but) these cars are not designed to bang wheels with each other at 225 mph,"" the veteran driver said. ""Our wheels (currently) are exposed. Once you have two cars touch each other, you don't have any control."" Wheldon's death was the first for the IndyCar circuit since March 2006, when driver Paul Dana was killed in a two-car crash while warming up for the season-opening race at Homestead-Miami Speedway. It is one of several in motor sports generally, one of the most famous being the elder Dale Earnhardt's death in NASCAR's 2001 Daytona 500. Sports Illustrated senior writer Jon Wertheim said Monday that the sheer speed of race cars, and the minimal distance separating them, means danger lurks around every turn and on every straightaway. Wheldon, for example, was bunched with several other vehicles cruising at about 220 miles an hour when Sunday's crash occurred. ""The fact of the matter is, you're dealing with very, very fast automobiles. They're not heavy cars,"" Wertheim said. ""There is, unfortunately, an assumption of risk when you get into one of those race cars."" Beyond questions about racing's safety generally, the condition of the Las Vegas Motor Speedway -- and whether or not it was too fast and too crammed with vehicles -- was the subject of intense questioning in the hours after Wheldon's death. Driver Dario Franchitti told ABC News that the track offered ""nowhere to get away from anybody."" ""This is not a suitable track, and we've seen it today,"" he said. The loop in Las Vegas is 1.5 miles, one mile shorter than that of the iconic Indianapolis Motor Speedway. At the same time, it is wider than many others -- such that more cars can run alongside, and potentially collide with, one another. In an interview with CNN on Monday, former IndyCar driver Lyn St. James noted too that the slope of the track's curves and its straightaway can create ""this momentum and this ability for all the cars to be able to go flat out, (which) really takes the car out of the driver's hands."" Not going as far as Franchitti in critiquing the Las Vegas oval, St. James said that a number of factors -- including the vehicles' speed and numbers, as well as the track's configuration -- came together ""like the perfect storm."" ""It was unfortunate, it was tragic, it was something we all wish would never have happened,"" she said of Wheldon's death. Blog: Wheldon's death should bring changes in racetracks . That sentiment rang true for many in the racing community. After the crash at the IZOD IndyCar World Championships, many of the remaining drivers were emotional during and after a five-lap salute in Wheldon's honor. The rest of the marquee event was canceled. ""There are no words for today,"" driver Danica Patrick, the first woman to win an IndyCar race in 2008, tweeted. ""Myself and so many others are devastated. I pray for suzi (Wheldon's wife) and the kids that god will give them strength."" Wheldon, who was born in Emberton, England, lived in St. Petersburg, Florida. His father was a go-kart racer, and his mother was the timer at a local track. As a driver, Wheldon teamed up with the Alzheimer's Association to promote awareness of Alzheimer's disease; he was wearing the association's logo when he won the Indy 500 in May. His mother was diagnosed with the disease in 2009. In North Carolina, Sven Bhem told CNN affiliate WGHP that his son-in-law -- who, just hours before this weekend's race, had sung him ""Happy Birthday"" over the phone -- wasn't ""just a great driver, but he was a great human being,"" Bhem said. ""He was always positive, always had something good to say about everybody."" He said Wheldon and his daughter had been married four years and have two sons, ages 2 1/2 years and 7 months. In a statement released Monday, Wheldon's management company, GP Sports Management, described the driver as a ""champion on the track and a devoted family man off it."" ""Dan loved his fans and always took that extra bit of time to take a photo, to sign an autograph, to make some young kid smile at the racetrack. Everyone wanted to be around Dan. His passion and his enthusiasm for life was infectious."" St. James remembered Wheldon as a ""brash kid from England"" when he first began. ""We watched him mature into being this absolute, consummate professional,"" she said. ""... He touched so many people."" She said she believes Wheldon's death will ""kind of raise the bar"" in terms of safety for drivers. While a number of safety measures are in place, and the sport will always be high-risk, ""we don't want this kind of thing to happen,"" she said. Tracy concurred, telling CNN's Wolf Blitzer that he hopes ""out of this tragedy, comes some good in terms of improving safety,"" like putting see-through glass in place of web-like netting around tracks. The driver added that his wife and parents have implored him to retire in the wake of his friend's death.

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of people were injured in Bahrain Friday, when rival groups clashed over an attempted march in the town of Riffa, a residential area where the ruling Al-Khalifa family lives. The national health ministry said 774 people were injured and 107 were hospitalized in the wake of the fighting. Anti-government demonstrators in Riffa had planned a march. A crowd numbering roughly 8,000 set off on the march, according to Bahrain's ambassador to the United States. But they were met by hundreds of people carrying swords, hatchets, metal pieces, cricket instruments and pieces of wood with nails hammered into them. The opposing group had already taken up positions in an effort to stop the planned march. Bahrain's ambassador to the United States took the unusual step of commenting on the clashes in Riffa, which he called a ""sectarian conflict"" between Shia and Sunni Muslim factions. Law enforcement officers had erected barbed wire fences in an attempt to ward off any fighting, Houda Ezra Nonoo said in a statement. The conflict began when small groups from opposing sides met at the security fence, she said. Accounts that claimed live ammunition was used by government forces were ""rumors,"" Nonoo added. She also denied allegations that people inhaled tear gas to the point of suffocation. Only eight tear gas canisters were used to disperse the crowd, according to Nonoo's statement. Video footage would support his version of the operation, she said. The attempted march in Riffa was organized by some of the more hard-line Shia groups among the government opposition. However, there are also moderate Shia groups and Sunni groups in the anti-government coalition. Sunni Muslims -- a minority in the kingdom -- dominate the government of Bahrain. The Shiite Muslim majority has staged protests in recent years to complain about discrimination, unemployment and corruption. Riffa is just over 12 miles (20 kilometers) southwest of the capital, Manama, where demonstrators have been protesting in Pearl Roundabout for a month. Seven people died there when security personnel tried to clear the area in mid-February. Protesters initially took to the streets of Manama to demand reform and the introduction of a constitutional monarchy. More than 500 people have been injured in Bahrain since the protest began, which human rights activists say is part of a wave of popular unrest crashing through the Arab world . The Bahrain Center for Human Rights said authorities launched a clampdown on dissent in 2010. It accused the government of torturing some human rights activists.

"Washington (CNN) -- Apparently no good deed goes unpunished for President Barack Obama, who was trying to make sure he didn't get a flabby belly after Thanksgiving but wound up with a fat lower lip instead. White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said the president received a dozen stitches after getting hit with an errant elbow during a Friday morning basketball game with White House aide Reggie Love and others at the Fort McNair military base in Washington. The elbow belonged to Rey Decerega, who works for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute. According to White House aides, Decerega went up for a shot and turned into the President, who was playing defense and accidentally got hit in the mouth. ""I learned today the president is both a tough competitor and a good sport,"" Decerega said in a statement released by the White House. ""I enjoyed playing basketball with him this morning. I'm sure he'll be back out on the court again soon."" According to Gibbs, ""After being inadvertently hit with an opposing player's elbow in the lip while playing basketball with friends and family, the president received 12 stitches today administered by the White House Medical Unit. They were done in the doctor's office located on the ground floor of the White House."" Aides said Obama was given a local anesthetic while receiving the stitches, and doctors used a smaller-than-usual filament. That increased the number of stitches needed to patch up the tear, but it made a tighter stitch so that the scar on the president's lower lip should be smaller. Obama frequently plays basketball, works out on a daily basis, and was undoubtedly playing Friday to work off some extra Thanksgiving calories. An official White House menu showed that in addition to turkey and the usual trimmings, the first family dined Thursday on six types of pie: apple, sweet potato, pumpkin, banana cream, cherry, and huckleberry. Asked by CNN if Decerega will be getting a presidential pardon, a top White House aide just laughed.","Obama gets 12 stitches after taking an elbow to the lip .

"Editor's Note: This is the fourth in a five-part series exploring Judge Sonia Sotomayor's background and life with those who know her, revealing the experiences that might shape her views as a Supreme Court justice. Sonia Sotomayor is flanked by her supervisor, Warren Murray, and D.A. Robert Morgenthau, right, in 1983. NEW YORK (CNN) -- Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor graduated with honors from Ivy League schools. But she may have learned some of her most memorable lessons as a young prosecutor, following police into abandoned tenements and tracking down witnesses on the grimy streets of New York. Sotomayor joined the Manhattan District Attorney's office in 1979 during an epic crime wave. Muggings, burglaries and assaults were rampant; homicides topped 1,800 a year. She was recruited from Yale Law School by Robert M. Morgenthau, Manhattan's district attorney. She was 25, and her starting salary was $17,000. The cases in Trial Bureau 50 seasoned the idealistic young lawyer and honed her trial skills. She could shred a witness on cross-examination and move a jury to tears, former colleagues recalled. New York City was awash in heroin, street crime and gun violence. To prepare for trials, she followed police into tenement shooting galleries, scaled rickety staircases in dilapidated buildings and fought off the stench of squalor to talk to reluctant witnesses. Sotomayor's former colleagues and her legal foes describe her as intense, driven and politically astute. As a prosecutor, she had a commanding presence and put in long hours, chugging several cans a day of the diet soft drink Tab and chain-smoking cigarettes. (She no longer smokes.)  Watch how she made an impression on fellow prosecutors » . Trial Bureau 50, with its crowded cubicles and walls painted the color of putty, has sent many lawyers onto distinguished careers in public service, including the late Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and John Kennedy Jr. Sotomayor's five years there, say Manhattan prosecutors past and present, make her uniquely qualified for the nation's highest court. If confirmed, she would be the only justice who prosecuted criminal cases, presided over them and handled criminal appeals.  See what would set Sotomayor apart on the court » . ""If you can handle a felony case load in New York County, you can run a small country,"" said Warren Murray, who ran the bureau when Sotomayor worked there, and still does. ""I think Sonia's most interesting days were in the district attorney's office,"" said Hugh H. Mo, a former homicide prosecutor who supervised Sotomayor and tried cases with her. ""You can grow up in the projects and still be very sheltered. She got her education on the streets of Harlem."" Like most rookies, Sotomayor started with misdemeanors, juggling 60 to 80 cases at a time, working 12-hour days in the 1930s-era building on the tip of Manhattan, and pulling an occasional shift in night court. ""Some of the judges liked to use the new assistants to clear their calendars,"" Morgenthau recalled. ""She quickly established herself as somebody the judges couldn't push around."" On her second trial, Sotomayor met Dawn Cardi, a rookie Legal Aid lawyer who was trying her first case. They became best friends. ""We were both baby attorneys,"" Cardi said. ""She's really, really smart and very well-prepared. She was an excellent trial attorney. She had a talent for it."" Another defense attorney, Gerald Lefcourt, recalled Sotomayor as ""a very zealous prosecutor,"" adding, ""She didn't see gray. She only saw black and white."" Sotomayor moved up quickly in the D.A.'s office. It wasn't long before she was prosecuting murder cases. To prepare for trials, she hit the streets, working junkies and street characters for information and comforting grieving families. The work was sometimes unnerving, but it could also provide an adrenalin rush. ""You could feel the violence. It was palpable,"" said Mo, who with Sotomayor accompanied detectives of Harlem's 28th precinct into top-floor apartments in six-story tenements to prepare for what became known as the ""Tarzan Burglar"" case. ""Normal people do not walk into these buildings,"" he recalled. ""They were hangouts for drug addicts."" Robert M. Morgenthau remembers Sotomayor for her role in both the Tarzan Burglar case and in winning the office's first conviction under a rewritten child pornography law. Sotomayor mentioned the lessons of the Tarzan case during her confirmation hearings. She said the case taught her ""the tragic consequences of needless deaths."" A family was destroyed after one of the siblings was killed by a bullet in the head, she said. ""They scattered to the four winds, and only one brother remained in New York who could testify,"" she said Tuesday. The Tarzan case was Sotomayor's rite of passage as a prosecutor. She sat second chair, meaning she assisted Mo, the lead prosecutor, at the murder trial of Richard Maddicks. Read the complaint (pdf) Maddicks earned his nickname by swinging from building to building with rope and cables, Mo said. Along his route, he burglarized top-floor apartments, robbed residents and shot people who got in his way. Sotomayor convinced Maddicks' girlfriend, Mabel Ivey, to testify, pointing out that she could shave years off her sentence in another case if she cooperated. They linked the murder weapon to Maddicks through a neighbor who sold liquor after-hours through a hole cut in the door of his basement apartment. Sotomayor questioned the man, Charles ""Wirdell"" Brown, in court, Mo recalled. It was a high point in the colorful trial. She had the jury in tears as she questioned the girlfriend of a man fatally shot by the Tarzan Burglar. Sotomayor impressed Mo with her organizational skills and ability to boil a complicated case into the essential elements that resonate with jurors. She helped write his opening statement for the five-week trial and -- long before computers and PowerPoint -- crafted People's Exhibit One, a large poster-board chart illustrating the pattern linking the Tarzan Burglar to his crimes. The chart somehow survived nearly three decades in Mo's basement laundry room. During the trial, Sotomayor handled the questioning of half the 40 witnesses. Maddicks was convicted of murder, robbery and related crimes and sentenced to 62½ years to life in prison. He's still serving time ""upstate,"" as Manhattan's prosecutors say. Even 30 years ago, it was obvious Sotomayor was going places.  See her life story told in pictures » . ""Did anybody think she was going to the Supreme Court? Of course not,"" said Cardi. ""But when you look back, you see she always stood out. She was always really a cut above."" ""She was very focused, very ambitious, very competent, very hardworking,"" Mo recalled. What struck him most, he said, was her confidence. ""She wanted to reach the highest pinnacle of the profession and didn't think that was far-fetched. You could see it. She wanted to make history,"" Mo said.","Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor began her legal career as a prosecutor .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Egyptians reveled in their chance to vote in a post-Hosni Mubarak era during a second day of parliamentary elections, but nightfall brought new clashes in Cairo's Tahrir Square that stretched into Wednesday. At least 88 people had been hurt, 28 of them seriously enough to go to a hospital, a Health Ministry official, Dr. Adel Adawi, told the state-run newspaper Al-Ahram. The rest were treated at makeshift clinics in the square, Adawi said, but hospitals expected more people to be brought in. The victims had been hit by rocks, glass bottles, birdshot and Molotov cocktails, Dr. Hisham Sheeha, another Health Ministry official, told CNN. At least a dozen gunshots rang out across the plaza, and ambulances darted in and out of the square as the fighting continued. Tahrir Square was the epicenter of the protests that drove Mubarak from power in February and the ongoing demonstrations against the military council that succeeded him. The state-run Middle East News Agency, citing a military source, said there were no police or troops in the square at the time. Witnesses said Tuesday's melee began with fights between vendors and protesters, who began throwing rocks and attacking their kiosks with sticks. The protesters complained some vendors were giving demonstrations a bad image by selling marijuana, said Mina Hagras, one of the demonstrators who has been camped in the square. ""This is not the spirit of the revolutionaries or the square,"" Hagras said. ""They warned them. They did not stop. So they took matters in their own hands and beat them up. Now, state TV is saying all the protesters in (the) square are thugs and drug users. This is not fair."" But Mohamed Shafei, whose sandwich stand was destroyed in the brawl, said the protesters turned on the vendors indiscriminately and confiscating their goods. ""Yes, there were several vendors selling hashish and pills, but not all of us are the same,"" Shafei said as he carried the remains of his kiosk. ""Now the vendors are pissed and retaliating."" The new clashes came after a second day of voting, the first time some Egyptians -- young and old -- have ever cast ballots. Citizens are picking members of the lower house of parliament, which will be tasked with drafting a new constitution after three decades of Mubarak's rule. Despite logistical problems and illegal campaigning that marred the first day of balloting on Monday, Egypt's stock exchange opened considerably higher Tuesday and saw an unprecedented wave of buying amid the elections. Voters decried the late opening of polling stations Monday and a delay in the arrival of ballots, leading the head of Egypt's election committee to promise a smoother voting process Tuesday. Election officials said they have received 964 complaints, 579 of which have been addressed, according to Egypt TV. State TV reported that 25 people were injured in election-related violence. Activist Hafez Abu Saeeda, of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights, said on Twitter he was in Al-Khaleefa ""working on an election tour, and an attack took place on our supporters before I arrived."" The army was able to control the situation immediately, he said. One person was injured. But many voters expressed jubilation at their chance to help build a new Egypt after the popular revolt that toppled Mubarak. ""Before, there was always cheating. Now -- I could be wrong -- but I think my vote will count,"" Mohamed Rida'a Mohamed Abdulla said as he left a Cairo polling station. Some polling areas were segregated by gender. Lines at both men's and women's stations snaked around buildings for hours. ""It's an awakening,"" one woman said, beaming, at a Cairo polling station. ""I'm very happy, and I feel that even when I see old ladies hardly walking, it makes me feel that really Egypt is reviving."" The stakes are high for Egyptian women, who worry that if Islamists gain a majority in the lower house of Parliament, their hopes for a more liberal life will be quashed. In Alexandria, the Al Noor Salafi Muslim party and the Freedom and Justice Party accused one another of breaking an ""honorable agreement"" aimed at cooperation. The Freedom and Justice Party is part of the once-banned Muslim Brotherhood, one of the nation's largest organizations. Yousri Hamad, a spokesman for the Al Noor Salafi party, said the Muslim Brotherhood spread false rumors and launched a ""smear campaign"" against the party. ""We were not as prepared for the elections as we should have been and did not spend enough money on the campaigning,"" Hamad said. But Essam Erian, spokesman for the Freedom and Justice Party, said the Salafis had breached the agreement by making such accusations without evidence. Ali Al Dali, an official monitor for the Egyptian Association of Human Rights, said eight cases of vote-buying had been documented in Alexandria, and police had been notified. About 45% of eligible voters in the city had cast ballots, he said. Elections for the lower house are scheduled to take place in three stages, based on geography. The last of the three stages is set to take place in January. Upper house elections will run between January and March. Presidential elections will be held by June, according to the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, Egypt's acting ruling body. Military leaders have said they will hand over power to a new government when one is elected, but many Egyptians say they don't trust the council and fear the military will cling to power. Over the past two weeks, at least 42 people have been killed in clashes as protesters called for an immediate end to military rule. An additional 3,250 have been wounded, according to the Health Ministry. Some Egyptians expressed skepticism or even boycotted the voting on Monday. ""There is no inclination that the judiciary is independent, so there is no way to prove the election will be free and fair,"" said Amr Hamzawy, a 32-year-old shopkeeper. CNN's Ben Wedeman, Ivan Watson, Leone Lakhani and Jim Clancy and journalists Mohamed Fadel Fahmy and Ian Lee contributed to this report.","NEW: Fresh Tahrir Square clashes leave nearly 90 wounded .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- While most sitting Supreme Court justices refuse to comment about current and future nominees to that bench, one member says she can't wait to welcome Judge Sonia Sotomayor to that exclusive club. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg her views occasionally are ignored by the male justices. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the only women on the nine-member court, told a group of lawyers and judges this weekend she was ""cheered"" at the nomination of Sotomayor. Ginsburg said the 54-year-old federal appeals court judge brings ""a wealth of experience in the law and in life. I am glad to no longer be the lone woman on the court, and look forward to a new colleague well-equipped to handle the challenges our work presents."" Her remarks were made at a semi-private conference in Upstate New York. The justice has made no secret of her desire to see greater gender diversity on her court. She has lamented the departure of her friend and colleague Sandra Day O'Connor in 2006. She told USA Today just weeks before Justice David Souter announced his retirement that more women should join her. ""Women belong in all places where decision are being made,"" she said. ""I don't say [the split] should be 50-50. It could be 60 percent men, 40 percent women, or the other way around. It shouldn't be that women are the exception."" Sotomayor has drawn controversy with her remarks at a 2001 speech: ""I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experience would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life."" She has echoed the sentiment in related talks she has given over the years. Ginsburg spoke weeks before Sotomayor was tapped for the high court about observations she and O'Connor had made in the past that were similar to Sotomayor's. ""You know the line that Sandra and I keep repeating... that 'at the end of the day, a wise old man and a wise old woman reach the same judgment'?"" she told USA Today. ""But there are perceptions that we have because we are women. It's a subtle influence. We can be sensitive to things that are said in draft opinions that [male justices] are not aware can be offensive."" Ginsburg used the word ""same"" to describe the outcome, Sotomayor used the word ""better,"" a wording she has told senators privately she now regrets. Ginsburg noted gender differences are ""seldom in the outcome."" But then, she said, ""it is sometimes in the outcome."" Ginsburg expressed frustration in that interview with how her male colleagues view her role, and how they view certain cases. She said in closed door conferences where all the justices gather to decide cases and pending appeals, her views occasionally are ignored. ""When I will say something -- and I don't think I'm a confused speaker -- and it isn't until somebody else says it that everyone will focus on the point."" The same thing can happen in the public setting of oral arguments, the 76-year-old justice said. A case from April dealt with whether school officials abused their discretion by conducting a strip search on a 13-year-old female student who was suspected of carrying ibuprofen medicine, in violation of the school's anti-drug policy. In arguments, she asked a lawyer for the school, ""After Redding [the student] was searched and nothing was found, she was put in a chair outside the vice principal's office for over two hours, and her mother wasn't called. What was the reason for... putting her in that humiliating situation?"" Her colleague Justice Stephen Breyer had noted, ""I'm trying to work out why is this a major thing to, say, strip down to your underclothes, which children do when they change for gym,"" Breyer said. ""How bad is this, underclothes? That's what I'm trying to get at. I'm asking because I don't know."" Ginsburg countered that the girl was told by female staffers ""to shake [her] bra out, to shake, shake, stretch the top of [her] pants."" In another case this term, the court ruled time off given women decades ago for pregnancy leave cannot be counted when deciding pension eligibility. Ginsburg dissented strongly, noting, ""Certain attitudes about pregnancy and childbirth throughout human history have sustained pervasive, often law-sanctioned, restrictions on a woman's place among paid workers and active citizens."" The appeal had parallels to a similar workplace discrimination claim involving Lily Ledbetter. The former tire company manager alleged she was paid less than her male counterparts for equal work for about two decades, but did not find out about the discrimination until she was about to retire. The high court in 2007 ruled against her, saying existing federal law did not allow such lawsuits to be filed so late. Most workers had 180 days to file a claim after the first discriminatory pay decision. But President Obama, in the first bill he signed when taking office in January, made law the Lily Ledbetter Act. It nullified the high court decision and said every new paycheck received over the years based on a discriminatory act -- regardless of when the first discrimination occurred -- would extend the statute of limitations 180 days. Ginsburg told reporter Joan Biskupic that oral arguments in the 2009 pregnancy case were, ""just for me, Ledbetter repeated."" Ginsburg is still recovering from surgery and post-operation chemotherapy after an early diagnosis in January for pancreatic cancer. Ginsburg has had no outward signs of complications, and has kept up with her busy schedule, both on and off the bench. She has told friends and colleagues privately she is doing well, and plans to be back on the bench for the start of the fall term. Sotomayor's Senate confirmation hearings will begin July 13.","Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg happy about possibility of female colleague .

"(CNN) -- A pair of earthquakes with magnitudes of at least 5.0 struck within 90 minutes of each other near Christchurch, New Zealand, on Monday, the U.S. Geological Survey reported, reviving vivid memories of a deadly quake that killed more than 180 people in February. ""Everyone is on edge here anyway,"" said Rhys Taylor, who said he could hear sirens and see helicopters flying over Christchurch. ""Obviously, power's out -- sort of all over the city at the moment -- and phone lines are down."" Police evacuated sections of the city's central business district after reports of a possible gas leak, police said. Several bridges in the city were closed as a precaution. ""It was quite an exciting ride,"" Christchurch Police Acting Inspector Murray Hurst told CNN after the first quake, adding that there was some damage caused by the quake and a few injuries that were not life-threatening. The first quake -- a magnitude 5.2 -- was centered 9 kilometers (5 miles) east-southeast of Christchurch at a depth of 11 kilometers (6.8 miles), according to USGS. The quake took place at 1 p.m. Monday. A second quake -- a more powerful 6.0 tremor -- struck at 2:20 p.m., roughly 13 kilometers (8 miles) north-northeast of the city at a depth of 9 kilometers (5.6 miles). And at least one smaller quake followed. A magnitude 4.6 quake struck at 2:40 p.m. about 11 kilometers (6 miles) east of Christchurch and at a depth of 12.5 kilometers (7.8 miles), according to the USGS. The quakes came nearly four months after a 6.3-magnitude temblor struck the same area, killing more than 180 people.

"Editor's Note: This is the last in a five-part series exploring Judge Sonia Sotomayor's background and life with those who know her, revealing the experiences that might shape her views as a Supreme Court justice. Sotomayor was nominated to U.S. district court in 1991 and federal appeals court in 1997. (CNN) -- Sonia Sotomayor had been a federal appeals court judge for about four months when Ellen Chapnick got a phone call in 1998. The Columbia Law School lecturer's students had worked and studied with Sotomayor as part of a program at the school, but Chapnick figured the partnership had come to an end with the judge's new job. ""She called me up and said, 'You know, I really miss your students. Isn't there something we can do about that?'"" recalled Chapnick, now Dean of the Social Justice Program at the school. ""And, of course, a judge rarely asks a question when she doesn't know the answer."" That call, and the partnership that would continue another six years, captures the essence of the woman who has spent years on the federal bench, friends and colleagues said. They remember a tireless worker spending late hours in her chambers or on projects like the college course: A tough decision-maker who would pick apart any lawyer foolish enough to come to court unprepared; a thoughtful jurist whose years as an aggressive prosecutor endeared her to law enforcement even as she developed a reputation as a social liberal; and a child of the Bronx who maintained a heart for people from all walks of life as she ascended to the legal world's loftiest positions. ""Her hobby is people,"" said Chapnick, who became friends with the woman now going through Senate confirmation hearings on her nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court. ""I've been in situations with her when everybody else around the table is a lot 'less important' -- if you define importance by positions of power and prestige -- and she's asking them questions.""  Watch Chapnick on how Sotomayor put students 'through the wringer' » . In 1984, Sotomayor, now 55, worked at Pavia & Harcourt, a ""boutique"" law firm in New York that focuses on international business issues. Her job included representing Fendi, the Italian luxury goods company that wanted to crack down on imposters selling knockoffs of its high-end handbags. Steven Skulnik, a colleague at the firm, remembered tagging along with Sotomayor on a police raid of a counterfeit operation in Harlem. He waited in the van. Sotomayor charged out alongside the officers. ""She had no fear,"" said Skulnik, now with the New York firm Squire Sanders. ""That's just her personality. She's the first one in."" He and others also recall her working long hours with a laser-like focus as she prepared for a case. ""[Co-workers] would walk by in the morning, and she'd be reading something or writing something,"" he said. ""You'd say, 'Hi, Sonia,' and she wouldn't even look up. She didn't notice. ""She would really bore in and make sure there was nothing about the case that she didn't understand."" That dedication hit her private life, Sotomayor has admitted. She told ABC's ""Good Morning America"" in 1986 that her workload ""was a contributing factor"" in the divorce three years earlier from Kevin Noonan. Work also made it difficult to date then, she said: ""A man who calls you three times and all three times you answer, 'I've got to work late.' ... After the third time he begins thinking, 'Gee, maybe she's not interested.'"" She left the law firm to take up President George H.W. Bush's nomination in 1991 and served as a U.S. District Court judge from 1992 to 1998. President Bill Clinton nominated her for a seat on the 2nd District U.S. Appeals Court in 1997, and she was confirmed more than a year later by the Senate to the position she still holds.  See Sotomayor's life in pictures » . Sotomayor's most high-profile moment on the bench -- and the one that probably brought her as close as a judge ever comes to winning fans -- came in 1995, when, with a stroke of the pen, she ended the Major League Baseball strike. The 1994 playoffs and World Series had been scrubbed because of the strike and the following season was threatened. Sotomayor, a lifelong Yankees fan, ruled in New York district court in favor of the players against the owners who she said were trying to undermine the league's labor system. She told lawyers she didn't need to hear witnesses or see more documents after their arguments.  See some of Sotomayor's high-profile decisions » . Chapnick said Sotomayor later talked about the case with a touch of irritation about some of the attention that came with it. Sotomayor remembered critics saying it was ""outrageous"" that a woman was deciding a case about baseball, Chapnick said. ""She said, 'Why don't they ask me? I'd tell them I had a mitt growing up,'"" Chapnick recalled Sotomayor saying. In her attorney and judgeship years, Sotomayor has made a good living, but not an extravagant one. She earned about $230,000 in her last year at Pavia & Harcourt and not much more as a judge, according to a questionnaire filed with the Senate. Of about $1.1 million in assets, nearly $1 million is the home she owns in Manhattan -- nice, but not exorbitant by the borough's standards. At Blue Ribbon Bakery, nearby her Greenwich Village home, workers say Sotomayor, who was diagnosed with diabetes as a child, stops in almost daily for sturgeon toast or breadsticks and a cup of decaf. She's thought of as just another neighbor and customer, Sasha Acosta-Cohen said. At work, Sotomayor the judge is described as straightforward, direct and no-nonsense.  See how Sotomayor might fit in with the Supreme Court justices » . A former clerk said she can be ""prickly from the bench"" but is friendly away from it. ""When she's in oral arguments, and when attorneys show up and they're either unprepared or are maybe raising a weak argument, she's very quick, and she's very exacting and intellectually demanding,"" Robin Car said. Away from the bench ""she's really just a warm, extremely kind and caring person."" Car recalled a 2001 conference at Hofstra University at which Sotomayor introduced Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, one of the court's most conservative members. ""I think he was a little bit unsure what she was going to say or what she was going to do,"" Car said. ""She went, and she did the introduction, and he responded, 'Wow, that was the most thoughtful introduction I've ever received.'"" ""Thoughtful"" is a word Chapnick also used to describe Sotomayor. She remembers a letter from a former student telling her how, as a Hispanic woman from a poor background, she'd been inspired by Sotomayor during the course the two taught together. In reviews of the course, students wrote ""not just how it shaped their view of the law but how it shaped their view of themselves,"" Chapnick said. She said the last time she saw Sotomayor, the prospective Supreme Court justice joked with her about their course, saying a possible move to Washington was no reason to quit. At least, Chapnick said, she thinks it was a joke.","Colleagues recall Sotomayor as tireless, focused worker .

Instead, on Friday mornings from April through September, you will find a cheerful band of six women -- some graying, some not, most of them attired in old T-shirts or overalls and work boots. One day a week, they set aside their own jobs to garden as a team at one of their homes, rotating every week so that each woman's property gets the full benefit of their collective burst of labor and artistic vision. Real Simple: How to negotiate anything . In the eight years since the group came together, the women, who call themselves the Wonder Weeders, have created pathways and sculptures, moved trees, and carved out acres of gardens from hillsides and overgrown bramble. Often they converse as they work, talking about the primroses that they are mulching, the big news that a friend has just received, or challenges that they are facing with their jobs. Other times they seem to read one another's minds, knowing when it's time to put down the garden gloves and just listen. Sowing the seeds . The women might never have come together except for an accident that befell 67-year-old Terry Funk-Antman in 2001. She shattered her knee, which left her unable to care for her garden. One day, frustrated at seeing her beloved roses wither away, she hobbled out to her front yard. Her neighbor Cathera Lane, a painter and a gifted gardener in her own right, walked by the house as Terry balanced precariously on her crutches, attempting to pull weeds. Real Simple: How to make a good first impression . Although the two had exchanged only a few words, Cathera instantly offered her assistance. ""You point to things and tell me what to do and I'll do it,"" she said. As the two women walked through Terry's garden and got acquainted, Cathera suggested that they might help each other out from time to time. Then Terry had an epiphany: ""If two people can work this way, why not six or seven?"" Cathera loved the idea, and they started brainstorming about whom to invite. ""We wanted real gardeners with no attitude,"" says Terry, a psychotherapist. A few weeks later, a handful of friends gathered at her home. In attendance: Susan Goldman, 63, a community organizer; Nikki Goldbeck, 63, a nutritionist; and Gayle Jamison, 63, an underwater photographer. Also a member from the start was Joy Hopkins-Hausman, a therapist and an artist, who died of breast cancer last August at the age of 61. Maria DeFranco, a 57-year-old sculptor and architect, joined in 2003. Real Simple: 5 inspirational friendships . At that first gathering, the women laid down the ground rules for their project: No fancy food or refreshments were to be served (water was all that the host had to provide), no lawn mowing, and no uninvited garden critiques. ""We all just wanted help with the tasks that would otherwise be overwhelming,"" says Susan. ""We didn't have any sense of where it would take us."" Green days . In the first few years, says Nikki, they were still in the beginning stages of collaboration, trying to prove themselves as dedicated gardeners. Conversation tended to revolve around the names of plants and design schemes. But gradually, as they harvested raspberries or cleared away weeds, intimate exchanges bloomed. ""We started talking about our families and our other passions,"" says Maria. ""In the midst of the work, we had these gem-like moments."" As the women's friendships grew, so did the scope of their projects. On Nikki's property, they restored a tranquil, bluestone-paved garden that had been hidden for years by overgrowth. At Maria's place, they filled a dozen hanging planters to adorn her wraparound porch. And for Cathera they lugged stones into position to make a beautiful, new border for her fishpond. Real Simple: How to be a good friend . With each woman bringing her individual skills to bear -- Gayle has her wide-ranging knowledge of flowers; Nikki, her impressive patience with weeding; Maria, her sculptor's brawn in moving boulders -- the friends have devoted themselves to helping each garden express its owner's sensibilities. For Terry, an exuberant woman who loves color, someone suggested showering morning glories over the cottage where she sees patients. For Cathera, who is as practical as she is artistic, the group has helped plant and maintain 32 varieties of fruits and vegetables. And when Joy was struck by a recurrence of cancer, they created a healing labyrinth, a circular pathway with a spot for meditating at the center. ""We've come to understand our labor as a concrete expression of our appreciation for one another,"" says Terry. On the day last August that Joy died, the Wonder Weeders had come to her home to garden -- it was her turn. As Joy's grown children and their families gathered at the house and waited for news from the hospital, the friends did what they do best: hard work. They made breakfast for everyone, cleaned the house until it was spotless, and, of course, weeded and tended the garden. When the call finally came, they hugged, wept -- then picked up their tools and continued their tasks. ""When people came to pay condolences, we wanted the garden to be as beautiful as Joy could have ever hoped,"" says Maria. That same day, Terry gathered up all the ripe peaches on the backyard trees. When Joy's family came back to town later that month, they each received one of the 30 pots of jam that Terry had made from the fruit, a sweet memory of their loved one and a manifestation of the Wonder Weeders' devotion. Reaping the rewards . On a hot, clear morning last September, the women were hard at work in Cathera's garden. Although Joy's death was still very much on all their minds, they focused on the tasks at hand. Susan and Gayle dragged a tarp loaded with brush to the back of the house, where it would be picked up. Nikki wielded pruning shears like a weapon in the hands of a highly skilled warrior. Later, sitting around the table on Cathera's porch, the friends took a moment to express what the group had come to mean to them. Certainly their gardens had developed and improved. But what they found more surprising was how the collaboration had caused the women to change, too. ""The group taught me to lean on other people,"" says Nikki, who is the primary caretaker of her 94-year-old mother. ""Over time I've gotten better at asking for help."" Gayle felt that the no-criticism policy had encouraged her to trust more readily that ""there is more than one right way to do things."" Maria says that the gardening has helped her become a bolder artist. ""It's easier to experiment and try new things with all this support behind you,"" she says. Real Simple: When friendships go wrong . This spring the group started up again. It's even smaller now: Cathera entered the hospital over the winter and was still there at press time, waiting to gain enough strength for a liver transplant. Having weathered so many changes, the members are contemplating their next chapter. Eight years in, many of their gardens are near completion. Maybe, wonders Gayle, it's ""time to offer a little extra help to local gardeners who are ailing or unable to do what they would like."" Susan has proposed that they start involving local children in their gardening. Real Simple: How to break bad habits . All the women are delighted that several other gardening co-ops, inspired by theirs, have sprung up in their area, the idea taking hold like a felicitous invasive species. ""Another circle develops,"" says Terry, ""a rippling out of the concept that we can expand our joy in our gardens by including others."" Change, growth, creativity -- these core values were never expressly spelled out in the Wonder Weeders' first meeting, but they have all become part of the group's unspoken ethos. With the arrival of the warmer months, everyone is eager to see what fresh bounty the season will hold. Get a FREE TRIAL issue of Real Simple - CLICK HERE! Copyright © 2011 Time Inc.

"(CNN) -- The United States have battled back to set up a final-day showdown in the Solheim Cup women's golf teams event in Ireland. With Europe doubling their one-point lead to 7-5 after Saturday's morning foursomes matches at Killeen Castle, the U.S. kept alive their hopes of a fourth straight title on Sunday by levelling at 8-8 after the fourballs. The 24 players will go head-to-head in 12 singles matches as the Europeans seek just a fourth success since the inaugural competition in 1990. Britain's Laura Davies will take on fellow veteran Juli Inkster in one of the key clashes, with the Englishwoman confident after overtaking Annika Sorenstam as the Solheim Cup's record points scorer. All about the Solheim Cup . ""To be honest, it was a bit embarrassing not to have the most points when I've played in every match,"" said the 47-year-old Davies, who has featured in all 12 stagings. ""So it's great to have made it. It's cleared the pressure and now I can relax a bit more without that extra edge in the singles."" Having sat out the foursomes, Davies and Melissa Bell beat Michelle Wie and Brittany Lang 4&3 but their teammates could not maintain the momentum. Europe take narrow lead after first day . Morgan Pressel and Cristie Kerr defeated Suzann Pettersen and Caroline Hedwall by one hole, Stacy Lewis and Ryann O'Toole triumphed 2&1 against Sandra Gal and Christel Boeljon, while Paula Creamer and Brittany Lincicome were 3&1 victors over Maria Hjorth and Azahara Munoz. Former U.S. Open champion Creamer will take on Catriona Matthew as she seeks to remain unbeaten, having played in all this year's matches.

"(CNN) -- Brian Adkins, a newly assigned American diplomat in Ethiopia, was found dead last weekend at his home in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, an embassy spokesman and a senior State Department official told CNN. U.S. Embassy press officer Michael McClellan identified Adkins and said he was from Columbus, Ohio. He was 25 at the time of his death. ""He was found dead over the weekend and a criminal investigation is under way,"" McClellan told CNN on Thursday. ""The Ethiopian federal police are investigating it."" Adkins, who would have turned 26 on Monday, received his undergraduate and graduate degrees from George Washington University, according to the school's newspaper, the GW Hatchet, which reported his death. According to the newspaper, Adkins joined the State Department after receiving his master's degree in 2007. A State Department official, who declined to be named because of the ongoing investigation, said it was the diplomat's first tour of duty as a foreign service officer. There were no apparent threats against him, and investigators were trying to determine whether he was the victim of a random crime. Adkins' father, Dan Adkins, told CNN affiliate WBNS that his family worried about him, but Adkins assured them he would be safe at a guarded compound. His sister, Tiffany Cooper, said the family was struggling. ""It is hurting us. There is no closure. We have no idea how our brother died,"" Cooper said. The GW Hatchet reported that Adkins moved to Ethiopia as part of a Thomas R. Pickering Foreign Affairs Fellowship, after studying the local language and culture for nearly a year. A GWU student and friend of Adkins described him as ""selfless, hardworking, confident, funny, charming, articulate, a scholar and a gentleman,"" according to the newspaper. ""The world has lost someone who had so much to offer. I miss him tremendously,"" senior Michael Geremia told the newspaper. ""When I received word of his death on Monday, which would have been his 26th birthday, a piece of me died in Ethiopia."" As a student, Adkins was active in the Knights of Columbus and the Newman Center, which are organizations run by the Catholic church, the paper reported. -- CNN's Elise Labott and Ben Brumfield contributed to this report.","U.S. Embassy says a criminal investigation is under way .

He's also a former mixed-martial-arts champion, and so -- strictly for the money -- he decides to get back in the ring, even if the clawing, kicking, anything-goes bouts threaten to kill him. Tommy Conlon (Tom Hardy), an Iraq-war veteran who left the battlefield under mysterious circumstances, is also an MMA fighter, and he too wants back in the ring. The two men are brothers, and were once close.

"(CNN) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that Israel could accept a peace agreement with a ""demilitarized Palestinian state"" as its neighbor. Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu said he would agree to peace with Palestinians. In his first speech accepting the concept of a two-state solution for the Middle East conflict, Netanyahu set rigid conditions for moving forward. Among them: unequivocal Palestinian recognition of Israel as the Jewish national state with Jerusalem as its capital, and full demilitarization for a Palestinian state -- no army, no rockets or missiles, no control of airspace. ""I say this in a clear voice -- if we receive a guarantee of this demilitarized unit, we will be prepared to reach agreement to a demilitarized Palestine side by side with the Jewish state,"" Netanyahu said, according to a direct translation of his speech at Bar-Ilan University's Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies in Ramat Gan, Israel. Initial Palestinian reaction was negative, with Palestinian legislator Mustafa Barghouti saying Netanyahu was calling for creation of a ghetto state. ""He is proving there is no partner for peace in Israel,"" Barghouti told CNN. Chief Palestinian Negotiator Saeb Erakat said Netanyahu ""left us with nothing to negotiate as he systematically took nearly every permanent status issue off the table."" ""He announced a series of conditions and qualifications that render a viable, independent and sovereign Palestinian state impossible,"" Erakat said. ""This speech fell far short of every single one of the benchmarks required of Israel in line with international law and existing agreements,"" he said, including the 2003 Roadmap for Peace. Netanyahu's speech, billed as a major statement on the peace process, follows President Obama's recent high-profile speech to the Muslim world and a visit to the region by Obama's Middle East envoy, former U.S. Sen. George Mitchell. Obama welcomed Netanyahu's speech as ""an important step forward"" and said the president remained committed to a two-state solution that would ensure Israel's security and provide the Palestinians ""a viable state,"" according to a White House statement. Obama pledged to continue working with all parties ""to see that they fulfill their obligations and responsibilities,"" the statement said. Netanyahu, of the center-right Likud party, previously refused to endorse a two-state solution. Netanyahu sounded themes popular with his conservative followers, repeatedly referring to Israel as the Jewish national homeland and demanding recognition of that by all Arab foes, including the Palestinians, for any chance at a peace agreement. He prompted applause with his statement that ""the land of Israel is homeland to the Jewish people, and that is the basis of our right to it."" ""The Palestinian leadership must rise up and say in a very straight way that we are tired of this conflict, we will recognize the right of the Jewish people to have a national homeland in this part of the world,"" Netanyahu said, according to the direct translation. He said Jerusalem would remain the capital of Israel -- refusing to yield on a sensitive issue for Palestinians -- and that a Palestinian state would have to be fully demilitarized to ensure the safety of Israel. Obama, in his June 4 speech in Cairo, Egypt, endorsed a two-state solution and urged compromise between ""two peoples with legitimate aspirations."" He repeated his call for both Israel and the Palestinians to fulfill all obligations under the 2003 Roadmap for Peace, including a halt to any expansion of West Bank settlements by Israel. Obama called America's bond with Israel ""unbreakable"" but said Palestinians have suffered in pursuit of a homeland. He also called for an end to Palestinian incitement against Israel and greater security in Palestinian territories. On Sunday, Netanyahu acknowledged the suffering on both sides from the continuing Middle East conflict, but insisted the roots of the conflict came from the Arab world's refusal to accept Israel's right to exist.","NEW: President Obama calls Benjamin Netanyahu's speech ""important step forward""

"(CNN) -- The bone fragment found near the California home where Jaycee Dugard is said to have been confined for 18 years is ""probably human,"" a sheriff's spokesman said Tuesday. Jaycee Dugard was locked in a shed tucked under a blue tarp in her alleged captor's backyard. Investigators said they found the bone last week on a neighbor's property in an area that Dugard's accused captor and rapist, Philip Garrido, had access to. The fragment, which was analyzed by an outside expert, will go on to the state DNA lab for testing, Jimmy Lee, director of Public Affairs for the Contra Costa County's Sheriff's Office said in an e-mail. ""The expert has determined that the bone fragment found in the backyard of Garrido's neighbor is probably human,"" Lee said. ""We will be requesting the state to see if it can develop a DNA profile on the fragment. It should be noted that it is not uncommon to find Native American remains in Contra Costa County,"" he said. Garrido and his wife, Nancy, have pleaded not guilty to 29 felony charges, including rape and kidnapping, stemming from Dugard's disappearance when she was 11 years old. Investigators believe Garrido kidnapped Dugard in 1991 in South Lake Tahoe, California, fathered two daughters with her and held her captive in a well-hidden compound behind his home in Antioch. After the Garridos were arrested in August, investigators used cadaver dogs to search the couple's ramshackle home and the surrounding rural property for possible connections to unsolved crimes. Police in Hayward, California, are trying to determine whether Garrido is linked to the 1988 kidnapping of Michaela Garecht, Hayward Police Lt. Chris Orrey said last week. Garecht and Dugard were of similar age and appearance, both were abducted in daylight and a sketch of a suspect resembled Garrido, Orrey said. In Dublin, California, investigators said last week they were looking into whether Garrido was connected to the 1989 disappearance of Ilene Misheloff, who was 13 when she was abducted. Garrido was convicted of kidnapping and raping Katie Callaway Hall in 1976. He was released from prison after serving 10 years of a 50-year sentence. He was labeled a sex offender and put on lifetime parole. CNN's Dan Simon contributed to this report.","Authorities: Bone found near home where Jaycee Dugard allegedly held captive .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- U.S. Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor said Monday that her hotly disputed judicial philosophy is, in fact, quite simple: Remain faithful to the law. Judge Sonia Sotomayor speaks Monday to the Senate panel considering her nomination to the Supreme Court. ""In the past month, many senators have asked me about my judicial philosophy,"" Sotomayor told members of the Senate Judiciary Committee during her opening statement at her confirmation hearings. ""It is simple: fidelity to the law. The task of a judge is not to make law, it is to apply the law. And it is clear, I believe, that my record ... reflects my rigorous commitment to interpreting the Constitution according to its terms, interpreting statutes according to their terms and Congress's intent and hewing faithfully to precedents established by the Supreme Court and by my Circuit Court. In each case I have heard, I have applied the law to the facts at hand."" Sotomayor said the ""process of judging is enhanced when the arguments and concerns of the parties to the litigation are understood and acknowledged."" That, she noted, ""is why I generally structure my opinions by setting out what the law requires and then explaining why a contrary position, sympathetic or not, is accepted or rejected. That is how I seek to strengthen both the rule of law and faith in the impartiality of our judicial system.""  Watch Sotomayor talk about her judicial philosophy » . Sotomayor argued that her ""personal and professional experiences help [her] listen and understand, with the law always commanding the result in every case.""  Watch Sotomayor's remarks to the Senators » . Some of Sotomayor's critics have argued that she has allowed her rulings to be swayed by factors such as ethnicity and race. Sotomayor, a federal appellate judge, would be the first Hispanic justice on the Supreme Court if her nomination is approved by the Judiciary Committee and the full Senate. She would be the 111th person to sit on the nation's highest court, and the third woman justice.  Watch Sotomayor take the oath » . Sotomayor, her foot in a cast from breaking her ankle a week after President Obama nominated her in May, sat impassively as senators detailed a deep divide between majority Democrats and minority Republicans on whether she is the best choice to fill the vacancy left by Justice David Souter's retirement. In an emotional moment in the beginning of her remarks, Sotomayor singled out her mother, who attended the hearing. ""I am here today because of her aspirations and sacrifices,"" she said. ""Mom, I love that we are sharing this together.""  Watch Sotomayor credit her mother » . The first Supreme Court confirmation hearing of the Obama presidency began Monday with leading Democrats and Republicans signaling a fierce ideological debate over Sotomayor's qualifications to sit on the high court. It attracted a packed gallery and was disrupted three times by protesters shouting anti-abortion sentiments. Democrats praised Sotomayor's extensive experience as a judge, which they called the most by any Supreme Court nominee in a century. They insisted her record showed she has been a modest jurist who consistently applied the rule of law. ""Judge Sotomayor's journey to this hearing room is a truly American story,"" committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, said after gaveling the first session to order. ""Let no one demean this extraordinary woman."" Leahy also ripped conservative ""ideological pressure groups"" for ""distorting"" Sotomayor's record and opposing a woman who ""will be a justice for all Americans.""  He noted she was first nominated to the federal bench by a Republican president, George H.W. Bush.   Watch Leahy praise Sotomayor » . However, Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the committee's ranking Republican, said Sotomayor represents the kind of activist judge that threatens the traditional foundation of the U.S. legal system. Sessions, a former attorney general in his home state, challenged the attribute of empathy cited by President Obama in nominating Sotomayor. ""Call it empathy, call it prejudice, call it sympathy -- whatever it is, it is not law,"" Sessions said. iReport.com: Share your thoughts on the Sotomayor hearings . In particular, Sessions quoted Sotomayor from past speeches in which she said a wise Latina woman should be able to reach a better ruling than a white man, saying it showed an inherent bias. ""I want to be clear: I will not vote for and no senator should vote for an individual nominated by any president who is not fully committed to fairness and impartiality toward every person who appears before them,"" Sessions said.  Watch Sessions call Sotomayor nomination ""critical"" » . Other Republicans conceded that Sotomayor was likely to win confirmation because Democrats hold a majority in both the Judiciary Committee and the full Senate, but questioned whether her judicial philosophy was for activism or applying the rule of law. ""Unless you have a complete meltdown, you're going to get confirmed,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said. He described Sotomayor as ""someone of good character,"" but he questioned her ""wise Latina"" comment as a possible indication of bias based on gender or race.  Watch Graham tell Sotomayor Republicans are ""unnerved"" by her speeches » . ""If I said anything remotely like that, my career would have been over,"" Graham said, adding that ""it just bothers me when somebody wearing a robe takes the robe off and says their experience makes them better than someone else."" Democrats called such concern unjustified, saying Sotomayor's record showed she was fair in applying the law as written.  Read about some of Sotomayor's key rulings » . ""I'm not sure how many of this panel can sit here today and seriously suggest that she comes to the bench with a personal agenda,"" said Sen. Charles Schumer of New York, noting her history showed no pattern of favoritism or bias for anyone. Other Democrats complained that Chief Justice John Roberts, nominated by Republican President George W. Bush in 2005, has been a conservative activist on the Supreme Court.  Find out how Sotomayor compares to current justices » . Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island, quoted CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin's statement that ""in every major case since he became the nation's 17th chief justice, Roberts has sided with the prosecution over the defendant, the state over the condemned, the executive branch over the legislative and the corporate defendant over the individual plaintiff."" ""And is it a coincidence that this pattern, to continue Toobin's quote, has served the interests and reflected the values of the contemporary Republican Party?"" Whitehouse said. ""Some coincidence."" Three brief outbursts occurred as different Democratic senators gave opening statements. In one, an unidentified man shouted: ""What about the unborn, senator? Abortion is murder. Stop the genocide of unborn Latinos."" Another, later in the session, repeatedly shouted: ""Abortion is murder."" While the nation's newest senator, Al Franken of Minnesota, made his inaugural committee statement, a woman and man shouted ""you're wrong"" at his reference to a woman's reproductive health and rights. The woman, Norma McCorvey, is better known as ""Jane Roe"" from the Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade. McCorvey, once a supporter of abortion rights, was the lead plaintiff in the 1973 ruling establishing a constitutional right to abortion. In all three cases, Leahy immediately ordered the protesters removed from the hearing room.  Watch protester disrupt hearing » .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Brandon Boyd blends into his Venice, California, neighborhood like any other resident. Brandon Boyd, front man for Incubus, is going on the road with the band in July. He surfs. Shuns Starbucks in favor of the local smoothie shop. Walks his French bulldog, Bruce. Oh, he also paints and makes music with his multiplatinum rock band, Incubus. The quintet hits the road on a North American summer tour in July, and just released a greatest hits collection called ""Monuments and Melodies."" The packaging features artwork by Boyd, who held his first solo art exhibit at Mr. Musichead Rock Art Gallery in Los Angeles last fall. The showroom is on the Sunset Strip, a stone's throw from the clubs that were host to Incubus' first gigs. The most spectacular paintings are large, fantasy-inspired pieces drenched in burgundy or aqua. Usually, the artwork springs to life in a corner of the singer's kitchen, where an easel permanently resides. It's a zen-like space, with high ceilings, glossy concrete floors and warm, burnished wood. But instead of the requisite Buddha statue, there's a rubber rabbit's head for inspiration. The muse seems ironic and appropriate, especially since Boyd swears his home was a brothel back in the 1900s. CNN talked to Boyd about collaboration, the fulfillment of art and finding the perfect wave. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: Isn't it ironic that you had your first solo art show before your first solo album? Brandon Boyd: I've actually thought very little about solo work up until just very recently. Most of it is because in my band, Incubus, it is very much a collaborative effort. I do what I do in the band, and everyone plays their respective parts, but in the end, we are sort of a democratic process. We meet in the middle for a lot of the songs, and I think that's why we sound the way we do -- because it's sort of five minds meeting in the middle. With my art thing, it's completely self-indulgent.  Watch the singer discuss his art » . CNN: So what does art fulfill in you that you don't get out of music? Boyd: To me, it's like the difference between a pen and a paintbrush. Music draws from almost the identical place as art does, which really is that intangible -- it's like you're pulling from the ether. I don't know where it comes from. Nobody really does. It sort of arrives when it wants to. ... I've been painting and drawing and taking pictures as long as I've been writing music -- and I've actually been drawing longer than I've been writing music. I didn't go around looking for it. It kind of found me. CNN: Your parents always encouraged you to explore your artistic side. Boyd: My parents are wonderful, and I'm really lucky -- but my mom has always been almost exclusively a right-brained person. She goes completely on her feelings of things, on her intuition, and so she instilled that in my brothers and I. And she also instilled in us from a very young age the importance of visualization -- visualization as a tool towards manifestation in your life. And so, from a very young age, if I didn't feel well, she's like, ""Well, draw what's happening and draw a solution."" If I had a stomach ache, I would draw a picture of my stomach, and I would draw what I thought the bad germs looked like -- and, you know, they had little robber masks on and stuff. And then I would draw a good germ, and of course it had a cape, and some tights, and he had a washcloth in his hands, and he could fly around and clean up the bad germs. And for some reason, I would always feel better afterwards. CNN: Did you ever visualize and draw what you wanted to achieve in terms of your music career, too? Boyd: Sometimes, yeah. But the guys in the band -- we kind of grew up together, and when they were like, ""We want to play music, let's start a band. You should be the singer,"" I was like, ""OK."" I'd never written anything before, I had never even really sang, but they knew that I knew how to draw, so it seemed logical that maybe I could write lyrics or carry a tune. So I always just sort of visualize lines, I would visualize a melody, and then sound it out to them, and they would help me sort of guide it through the instruments. And eventually, I got good enough at it that I was able to do it completely on my own. CNN: When you finish a painting, is it very much like finishing a song or finishing an album? Boyd: Yeah, there is definitely a sense of accomplishment. Very rarely is there any confusion as to when a painting or a song is finished. You just know when it's done.

"Emma Coleman Jordan is a professor of law at Georgetown University Law Center. She was a White House fellow in 1980-81, serving as special assistant to the attorney general and working on the nomination process of Sandra Day O'Connor, the first female Supreme Court justice. She was also counsel to Professor Anita Hill during the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings in 1992. Emma Coleman Jordan says Sonia Sotomayor's 350 judicial opinions are largely uncontroversial. (ESSENCE)  -- As Judge Sonia Sotomayor prepares to become the next U.S. Supreme Court justice, her lifetime of diligence and speed reading will now be crucial to help her navigate the next phase of her nomination. From here on out, she will be silent. We will not hear her voice again until she sits before the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. In the spring of 1981, I was this African-American progressive Democrat, a female law professor chosen to work as a White House fellow assigned to Republican Attorney General William French Smith. I was one of three special assistants working directly on the search for the replacement to Justice Potter Stewart, which led to Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's nomination. I was responsible for preparing briefing books for Attorney General Smith's chief of staff, Kenneth Starr, before the O'Connor nomination was announced, so I know precisely what Judge Sotomayor will experience in the next 60 days. ESSENCE: Obama's Sotomayor decision . The judge will be working feverishly with a team of lawyers from the Office of the White House Counsel, Gregory Craig, the Office of the Vice President, and the Justice Department. After her press conference with the president last week, more than likely she went straight to a briefing session in which she was given several thick briefing books, filled with memos that identify the most difficult questions of constitutional law that the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee are likely to ask during her confirmation hearing. ESSENCE: Obama's mentor weighs in on nomination . The list of issues she will address will certainly include, but will not be limited to, questions about presidential power. The intense recent debate on the limits of presidential authorization for ""enhanced interrogation techniques,"" closing Guantanamo Bay, military commissions, and domestic wiretapping will surely produce a slew of questions. The lines of attack by outside interest groups are already beginning to take shape, but Sotomayor's 350 judicial opinions are largely uncontroversial. So those who oppose her nomination will likely be forced to create a fusion between her personal story of educational mobility through affirmative action and her judicial views. They will try to take the president's selection criterion of ""empathy"" and turn it against Sotomayor as a sword to accuse her of being a race- and identity-sensitive ideologue. It helps considerably that her nomination comes at the beginning of the first term of a popular, media-savvy president. In this way, she is in the same position as Sandra Day O'Connor was when her nomination was announced in July 1981, at the beginning of President Reagan's first term. When I first saw O'Connor's résumé, before the nomination became public, I thought, there are too many gaps here. What did she do right after law school? Why had she never practiced law with a major law firm? Why had she chosen to be an elected politician? The missing elements I was looking for were things that cannot be captured in a résumé, like the fact that this brilliant woman was once prohibited from entering the practice of law, even though she graduated third in her class at Stanford Law School. Watch more What Matters content . Her résumé did not include information on her own experience of exclusion and discrimination -- life experiences she would later call upon when it was time for her to cast the deciding vote against ending affirmative action in higher education in 2003. Selecting a Supreme Court justice is an art, not a science. This isn't just about checking a box. It's a judgment call the president has made based on many things, including those personal experiences and a sense of chemistry between the president and the nominee. ESSENCE: Blacks in the White House . The Sotomayor hearings may give us a peek into her personal background. But the likelihood is that we won't really learn how her own experiences will have an impact on her legal reasoning as a justice. For now, we can only count on her diligent preparation to face partisan interest groups who will try to distort her identity and her record. Prepare to see the future justice-in-the-making. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Emma Coleman Jordan.","Emma Coleman Jordan is professor of law at Georgetown University .

"(CNN) -- U.S. Ryder Cup captain Davis Love III plans to emulate the decision of his Presidents Cup counterpart Fred Couples and select former world number one Tiger Woods for next year's contest with Europe. Woods, a 14-time major winner, has struggled with form and fitness since problems in his personal life emerged two years ago. The American has slipped to 50th in golf's world rankings, having not won a tournament since the Australian Masters in November 2009. But the 35-year-old's recent slump has not prevented Couples, the 1992 Masters champion, from selecting Woods as a wildcard pick for November's Presidents Cup clash with the International team in Australia. ""Well I've been asked that a lot, what would I do if I was in Fred's situation,"" Love, himself a former major champion, told a press conference at Medina Golf and Country Club in Chicago, the venue for the 2012 Ryder Cup. Look out Europe: American golf is bouncing back . ""You certainly want one of the best players ever in the game, you want him on your team. I'm hoping, for Tiger's sake, that he has a full healthy season next year and we are not in this situation. That he's back to his form and he's ready to go. ""I would love to play as Tiger Woods' partner in a Presidents Cup or a Ryder Cup. So I would probably have to go with exactly what Fred did."" Woods has played in six Ryder Cups since 1997, but his only experience of team victory came at Brookline, Massachusetts in 1999 after missing out due to injury three years ago. He had planned to take the rest of this year off, but his Presidents Cup selection persuaded him to enter the Frys.com Open starting October 6, when he will be partnered by new caddy Joe LaCava -- who carried Couples' bag for more than 20 years. LaCava left Couples this year when the 51-year-old decided to reduce his playing schedule, and worked with 2010 Ryder Cup player Dustin Johnson until the end of the PGA Tour's recent FedEx Cup playoffs. ""Joe is an outstanding caddy,"" Woods told his official website on Sunday. ""I have known him for many years. I've personally seen the great job he did for Freddie. I'm anxious for us to be working together."" LaCava added: ""I'm excited to be working with Tiger. I contacted Tiger and Mark (Steinberg, Woods' agent) because this is a unique opportunity to be part of something very special.

"Editor's Note: This is the third in a five-part series exploring Judge Sonia Sotomayor's background and life with those who know her, and revealing the experiences that might shape her views as a Supreme Court justice if confirmed. Sotomayor won the Moses Taylor Pyne Prize, the highest honor given to an undergraduate at Princeton. PRINCETON, New Jersey (CNN) -- Sonia Sotomayor spent her first week at Princeton University obsessing over the sound of a cricket. Growing up in New York City, her only notion of this insect was Jiminy from ""Pinocchio."" She tore her dorm room apart looking for the critter every night. Finally, her then-boyfriend and future husband visited and explained that the cricket was outside the room, where she had been holed up most of that week in 1972. ""This was all new to me: we didn't have trees brushing up against windows in the South Bronx,"" Sotomayor recalled in a speech to the Princeton Women's Network in 2002. The freshman who was so taken aback by a cricket's chirping now has a more public challenge: Senate hearings on whether to confirm her as a Supreme Court justice, potentially the first Latina to hold such a post. At one time, being different may have been difficult -- for it wasn't just Princeton's crickets that startled Sotomayor. The academics and the students on the leafy Gothic campus, with its ivy-covered dormitories and castle-like towers, also made her feel out of place. Sotomayor, who was on a full scholarship, started ""a little more on the shy side,"" said Sergio Sotolongo, who attended high school and Princeton with Sotomayor. ""She did mention that, as a freshman, she felt sometimes intimidated by others and didn't really raise her hand very much,"" said Sotolongo, now chairman and CEO of Student Funding Group in Liberty Corner, New Jersey.  Watch classmates, professor remember Sotomayor » . As a first-year student, Sotomayor felt what she's called a ""chasm"" between herself and her classmates. She really only knew the Bronx and Puerto Rico, while her classmates spoke of European vacations and skiing. She said in 1990 that she felt she was a ""product of affirmative action"" and questioned whether she would have been accepted into the Ivy League using ""traditional numbers"" from test scores alone.  See how many of the Supreme Court justices went to Ivy League schools » . She would certainly have looked different to her classmates, with relatively few Latinos or minorities at Princeton during her college years. Even being a woman was different for Sotomayor's class -- the college had opened its doors to women three years earlier, but male students were still superior in numbers and (in some cases) attitudes. Judith Perlman, who lived down the hall, explained: ""I'd go to class and I would say things, and the professor would say, 'Oh, we usually express ourselves in a more gentlemanly fashion here.'"" Perlman and Sotomayor shared ""girl talk"" but about what they wanted to do with their lives, not about things like fashion, which interested neither. Academically, Sotomayor also faced a gap. She would later graduate summa cum laude and be awarded the top undergraduate honor, the Moses Taylor Pyne Prize, but she stumbled that first year. Peter Winn, who taught Sotomayor and was her thesis adviser, said her early writing reflected the fact that her first language is Spanish. ""She could be very assertive and very articulate, but not initially,"" said Winn, now a professor at Tufts University. ""Sonia was someone who entered Princeton as a young woman with enormous potential, and one of the things that happened at Princeton was, she learned how to fulfill that potential,"" he said. Nancy Weiss Malkiel, now dean of the college, agreed with Winn, writing in an e-mail that Sotomayor came to Princeton ""with high intelligence and great ability, but without a very sophisticated grounding in the study of history."" Malkiel, who taught history, said she worked with Sotomayor to develop the student's skills in the spring of her first year. Sotomayor also worked independently, spending one summer reading classics that were new to her, including ""Alice in Wonderland,"" ""Huckleberry Finn,"" and ""Pride and Prejudice,"" to attune herself more to the cadences of English, she has said. Despite the challenges, the young woman encouraged her friend from the Bronx, Sotolongo, who is one year younger, to enroll in the fall of 1973. ""In the end, clearly she was very happy to have gone to Princeton,"" Sotolongo said. And by the time Sotolongo began his freshman year, Sotomayor was showing off a new personality. ""She certainly opened up as she got her feet under her,"" said James Resnick, who also majored in history and is now a consultant at Keystone CompControl in Butler, Pennsylvania. With Charles Hey-Maestre, who was a year behind her, Sotomayor founded the student organization Accion Puertorriquena and by 1974 she was speaking out for the group in the Daily Princetonian student paper. The group helped to file a complaint with the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, alleging that Princeton showed a ""lack of commitment"" in recruiting Latino students and hiring Latino faculty and administrators. Hey-Maestre, now executive director of Puerto Rico Legal Services in San Juan, Puerto Rico, said Sotomayor ""has the ability also that if she's feeling insecure about something, she manages it, and doesn't project it."" Latino affairs seemed to be an outlet for Sotomayor socially. Hey-Maestre said she was focused on her studies but went to some parties, especially Puerto Rican cultural celebrations. Otherwise, Hey-Maestre and Perlman remember, Sotomayor spent time with her off-campus boyfriend, Kevin Edward Noonan. They were later married, but divorced after seven years. Outside the university, Sotomayor volunteered at the Trenton Psychiatric Hospital as an interpreter. She talked at length with Sotolongo, while he was working on a project at the Trenton police department, about why youth got involved in criminal activities and how the cycle of recidivism might start and stop. ""Those were issues she was very concerned about, and I think in whatever circles she could, made those feelings known and expressed them,"" Sotolongo said.  See photos from Sotomayor's life » . Sotomayor's interest in Puerto Rican matters fed her as a history major. She wrote her undergraduate thesis on Luis Munoz Marin, the first governor of the island elected by popular vote. ""She was bending over backwards to be fair to points of view she didn't necessarily agree with,"" Winn said. The Sonia Sotomayor who went on to Yale Law School had matured, with classmates describing her as ""always willing to raise her hand,"" ""confident,"" ""outgoing,"" and ""one of the more outspoken people."" Read more about her time at Yale . She may still have been the girl from the Bronx, but she did not try to use her experience of hardship as leverage, said Stephen Carter, a Yale classmate of Sotomayor and now a professor there. ""She would never sit around and say, 'Oh, well, I grew up in a housing project so I know,'"" Carter said. ""She didn't feel her background gave her some kind of special trump. She wanted the argument to work. She would tell you why she thought something, and the 'why' never had anything to do with where she came from.""","Sonia Sotomayor arrived at Princeton in 1972 in fourth co-ed class .

"Paris (CNN) -- The mayor of a French town where students were held hostage for more than four hours Monday wants to reassure parents that ""schools in France are safe."" ""We do not want to create an environment of terror in the classroom,"" Mayor Jean-Louis Fousseret said. ""We shouldn't focus on this issue."" About 20 children, aged 4 to 6, were in a classroom when the incident began; five children and their teacher were held until the incident was resolved, Besancon police said. The hostage-taker is about 17 years old, according to the French Ministry of Education. He was armed with two swords and had ""demands,"" the ministry said, without specifying what they were. He has been arrested, the mayor said. ""We were dealing with someone who was suicidal and wanted us to give him a weapon,"" Fousseret said. ""There is no specific danger in Besancon."" The father of one of the hostages said that he was ""very afraid"" for his child but that the students had confidence in their teacher. ""The teacher was very, very calm and confident. She helped them,"" Babacar Kebe told BFM. ""I have not asked them questions because they are very young, and I don't want them to get upset."" A security cordon was placed around the school, and police marksmen took positions outside, pictures from the scene showed. They did not enter the school during the incident, the mayor said. The incident started at 8:30 a.m. at the Charles Fourier school in the borough of Planoise and ended about four and a half hours later. France last had a high-profile school hostage incident 17 years ago. Six girls and their teacher were held hostage for two days in the suburbs of Paris in 1993. A man calling himself ""the Human Bomb"" strapped explosives to his body and demanded about $18 million to release them. He was killed by police marksmen using guns with silencers, press reports said.

"(CNN) -- A Red Cross worker was killed Wednesday during shelling in the conflict zone in Sri Lanka, the third aid worker killed in six weeks, the International Committee of the Red Cross says. A photo supplied by a humanitarian group on Sunday shows civilians allegedly injured in government shelling. The worker, identified as Majurin Sivakurunathan, was killed along with his mother during an assault, a ICRC spokeswoman said. The fighting between the Sri Lankan troops and the rebel Tamil Tigers has intensified in the conflict area to the point that the ICRC can not get food to that area or help the sick and wounded, said Sarasi Wijeratne, a ICRC spokeswoman. The latest death comes after Sri Lanka angrily rebuked a U.N. official Tuesday over remarks by the organization that a civilian ""bloodbath"" had occurred in the north of the country. U.N. spokesman Gordon Weiss told CNN on Monday that hundreds of civilians died during weekend fighting because the Sri Lankan army had surrounded rebel fighters in the country's north, putting residents in the crossfire. The Foreign Ministry expressed its displeasure to Amin Awad, acting resident representative of the United Nations in Sri Lanka, about the comments. Mahinda Samarasinghe, Sri Lanka's minister of disaster management and human rights, initially said Weiss would be summoned to explain his remarks, but this did not happen because of diplomatic protocol, a source told CNN, noting that he is a junior official at the U.N. office in Colombo. Rebel claims of civilian deaths have been considerably higher than those provided by the U.N. Lawrence Christy, the head of the Tamils Rehabilitation Organization, said more than 3,200 civilians died in fighting from Sunday evening until Monday morning, the rebel Web site TamilNet reported.  Watch frustration build at the United Nations » . The Sri Lankan government has denied the allegations and accused the Tamils of ""taking the whole world for a ride with its well-engineered propaganda ploys,"" while turning their weapons on civilians trying to flee the combat zone. Tamil Tiger rebels have been fighting for an independent state in Sri Lanka's northeast since 1983. As many as 70,000 people have been killed since the civil war began, and the Tigers have been declared a terrorist organization by the European Union and more than 30 countries, including the United States.","Red Cross worker killed during shelling in the conflict zone in Sri Lanka .

"Washington (CNN) -- Folklore says that George Washington was known for never telling a lie. But as the United States marks its first president's birthday, a new poll indicates that 74 percent of the public thinks the father of our country did lie to the public while he served as president. It's an indication that Americans think the government has been broken for a very, very long time. The CNN/Opinion Corporation survey was released Monday on the 278th anniversary of Washington's birth. Three quarters of people questioned in the survey think that modern-day federal officials are not honest, a figure that is essentially unchanged since 1994. But the poll suggests that Americans think the problem of dishonesty is not a new one. And it's not just George Washington; 71 percent think that Abraham Lincoln, known as ""Honest Abe,"" also lied to the public while serving in the White House. Full results (pdf) ""It's all part of a rich tradition in American history -- the belief that politicians are not always telling the truth,"" says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. What should we make of the figures for Washington and Lincoln? ""Part of it may be the recognition that, however much we revere them today, both men were politicians, and Americans are always a little cynical about people seeking office. Part of it may also be a realistic assessment that the president sometimes has to keep things from the public,"" adds Holland. ""But whether it's based on cynicism or realism, or a little of both, it's an indication that Americans think that our government has been broken for many, many years."" According to CNN poll numbers released Sunday, Americans overwhelmingly think that the government in this country is broken, but the public overwhelmingly holds out hope that what's broken can be fixed. The CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll was conducted February 12-15, with 1,023 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points for the overall survey.

"(CNN) -- A German top-division football match was called off on Saturday after the appointed referee apparently tried to commit suicide before the kickoff. Cologne's game against Mainz was postponed when match official Babak Rafati failed to show up, the home team's website reported. German Football Assocation president Theo Zwanziger called an emergency press conference at Cologne's RheinEnergieStadion to explain the situation. ""At 1345 I was informed that something terrible had happened,"" Zwanziger said. Rafati, a German with Iranian ancestry, did not appear at midday for his scheduled appointment with his three assistants, who then went to his hotel room and opened it with the help of staff. The 41-year-old was found inside in a ""motionless"" state, Zwanziger said. Police confirmed that no-one else was involved, and it is assumed that he tried to commit suicide. ""According to the information that I have, his state is stable,"" Zwanziger said. ""He is no longer in critical condition and he is currently being treated in the intensive care unit."" Zwanziger said Rafati's assistants were receiving counseling after the incident, which came two years after the suicide of former Germany international goalkeeper Robert Enke. Rafati had refereed in the Bundesliga since 2005, and was on the panel of FIFA's international officials from 2008 before being dropped this year, the AFP agency reported. ""The pressure in professional sports is unbelievably high. We just don't manage to bring the right balance into it. No-one should be in such a hopeless situation,"" said Zwanziger, who promised to provide support for Rafati's family and colleagues. Saturday's other Bundesliga matches were played as scheduled. Bayern Munich's lead was reduced to two points after a 1-0 home defeat by defending champions Borussia Dortmund. Teenage midfielder Mario Gotze score the only goal in the 65th minute to put Dortmund second on 26 points, above Borussia Monchengladbach on goal difference. Gladbach crushed fifth-placed Werder Bremen 5-0 as Marco Reus scored a hat-trick, while Schalke moved up to fourth with a 4-0 win at home to Nuremberg thanks to a double from Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and another goal from veteran Spanish strike partner Raul. Wolfsburg moved clear of the relegation zone with a 4-1 win over Hanover, while third-bottom Freiburg snatched a 2-2 draw against visiting Hertha Berlin as Stefan Reisinger scored his second goal five minutes into time added on.","German Bundesliga match is called off after referee fails to show up .

"(CNN) -- Six-time boxing world champion Floyd Mayweather returns to the ring Saturday for the first time in more than a year, squaring off against Victor Ortiz. Mayweather, 34, has won all 41 of his professional fights and is a six-time world champion at five different weights. He is hoping to add more laurels at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas -- specifically, the World Boxing Council welterweight championship that Ortiz won after beating Andre Berto in April. The opponent for Mayweather, who has 25 knockouts over his professional career, is not the man many hoped he'd fight next: Eight-division world champion Manny Pacquiao. But disagreements over drug testing and other issues have repeatedly derailed these talks. Instead, Ortiz will be his opponent. The 24-year-old American has suffered two defeats and two draws in his 33 fights. ""I'm a world champion for a reason, and I am not going to let go of my title any time soon,"" Ortiz said soon after the match was announced. ""This is going to be a great fight, but I will remain a world champion for many years to come."" In a teleconference last week to promote the fight, Mayweather said that -- despite concerns about rust and age -- he ""still feel(s) strong when I get to the gym."" ""I still think I'm very, very sharp ... and I think the reason why is, I don't think that I have been in any toe-to-toe wars,"" he said. Recently, Mayweather has made headlines more for his legal run-ins outside the ring than his performance in it. That includes his arrest last December on a misdemeanor battery charge, after he allegedly assaulted a security guard at his housing complex. Also, his former girlfriend has also accused the boxer of domestic violence. A criminal trial is scheduled to start in January. HBO -- like CNN, a division of Time Warner -- reports that Mayweather is the defendant in a total of six court cases, including one levied by Pacquiao alleging defamation.

"(CNN) -- Juventus are back on top of the Italian Serie A table after a comfortable 3-0 home win over Palermo on Sunday maintained their unbeaten start to the season. Goals from Simone Pepe, Alessandro Matri and Claudio Marchisio put Juve ahead of Lazio, who drew 0-0 at Napoli on Saturday, on goal difference -- with Antonio Conte's side also having a vital game in hand. Pepe opened the scoring in the 20th minute when he was left unmarked to head home Giorgio Chiellini's cross. Andrea Pirlo then hit the post with a curling effort before Matri doubled the advantage three minutes into the second half when finishing from a tight angle. And the points were sealed in the 65th minute when Marchisio netted from close range after a smart dummy from Matri deceived the Palermo defense. Although Juventus are back on top of the table, the race for this year's Scudetto promises to be the tightest for years with just one point separating the top four teams. Champions AC Milan are third, a point behind the top two, after their goalless draw at Fiorentina on Saturday, while former leaders Udinese are now in fourth place -- level on points with Milan -- after losing 2-0 at Parma. A Jonathan Biabiany header and a Sebastian Giovinco penalty gave Parma a victory that lifted them up to ninth place in the table. Despite their defeat to Juventus, Palermo remain fifth, although they are five points behind Udinese. Meanwhile, at the bottom of the table, Marco Parolo scored seven minutes from time to give Cesena their first win of the season, 1-0 at fellow strugglers Bologna. Despite that win, Cesena remain bottom on six points, one behind Novara who were beaten 1-0 at Genoa. Two matches were played in the German Bundesliga, with Thorsten Fink collecting his first win as Hamburg coach with a 2-0 success at Hoffenheim. Jose Guerrero and Marcel Jansen secured Fink's maiden success after three successive draws as Hamburg moved out of the relegation zone and into 14th place. The day's other match saw Austrian striker Martin Harnik score both of Stuttgart's goals in a 2-1 win over bottom club Augsburg, who are three points adrift at the foot of the table.

"(CNN) -- Golf's $10 million jackpot is well and truly up for grabs this weekend after the FedExCup series pacesetters faltered in Friday's second round. Five players are guaranteed to take home the loot if they can claim the Tour Championship's additional $1.44 million first prize on Sunday, but it was Adam Scott who moved into pole position at the halfway stage. The Australian started the week 19th in the PGA Tour's standings, but a five-under-par 65 at East Lake gave him a one-shot tournament lead and catapulted him into top spot in the end-of-season playoffs. Webb Simpson, who leads the FedEx standings, was tied for 19th after his 70 -- which dropped him below Scott in the projected points. He bounced back from four early bogeys with a late birdie and an eagle. ""I've got to win and I imagine Webb must have to finish pretty low to give me a chance,"" Scott, who birdied the last two holes for the second day in a row, told the PGA Tour website. ""I just figured if I win this week, I'll be happy no matter what. I'll finish what I think has been a really good season, moving in the right direction with everything, and look forward to next season."" Veteran Korean K.J. Choi matched the resurgent Scott, who has bloomed since taking on Tiger Woods' former caddy Steve Williams. Choi went into the weekend on seven-under 133 to be one shot clear of another in-form Australian, Jason Day, and world No. 1 Luke Donald. ""You never know what can happen in the next two days,"" said Choi, who regularly donates part of his winnings to charities. ""You know, if I were able to win that money ... I could put the money to good use through my foundation. But there's still two days left, so all I can do is try to finish it out and hope for the best."" Donald was the best of the top five as the Englishman carded 68, one shot worse than Day. Big-hitting Bubba Watson burst into contention with a 64 to be tied for fifth with first-round leader Keegan Bradley, Bill Haas (67) and Hunter Mahan (68). Bradley, who won his first major at nearby Atlanta Athletic Club six weeks ago, followed up his opening 64 with a 71. Fellow American Jason Dufner, who he beat in a playoff at the PGA Championship, was another shot back on 136 after a 70. No. 2 Dustin Johnson suffered two double bogeys in his 73 to fall to a tie for 26th in the 30-man field to a projected fourth overall. England's No. 3 Justin Rose was in a group of three at the bottom of the heap after a 75 dented his hopes.","Adam Scott leads at the halfway stage of the Tour Championship in Atlanta .

"(CNN) -- With an awesome story and continuation of the gameplay that has made the franchise great, ""Gears of War 3"" ties a brilliant and bloody bow atop a video-game trilogy that's been seven years in the making. The latest third-person shooter game from Epic Games and Microsoft wraps up the ""Gears"" story arc and answers all the lingering questions that have arisen in the battle against the reptilian Locust and their mutant cousins, the Lambent. Players will control Coalition soldier Marcus Fenix for most of the game. But certain levels require the player to switch off to another member of his Delta Squad. The game starts a couple years after the conclusion of ""Gears 2"" and finds Marcus in jail. Characters familiar to players of the franchise are re-introduced in the opening scenes, and the action kicks off quickly at an unrestrained pace. Combat typically offers four options for weapons: a primary weapon, secondary weapon, pistol and grenade. Three other players are with the team, and they can be controlled by the computer or by others for co-op play, which is fun if you want to get a real feel for the campaign while enjoying the game with your friends. The weapons have weight to them and feel powerful. Shooting from behind cover, one of the hallmarks of the franchise, is required as enemies appear from nearly every angle. You'll want to keep your head down. Teamwork is key. Not only will a mate come to your rescue when you are down, they can also set up opportunities to flank your opponents and end battles quicker. It all flows naturally (much like the copious amounts of blood spilled in the battles) and is well-paced, with plenty of ammo and weapons to be scavenged and used. The game helps new players along with a casual mode that highlights enemies and objectives for easier play. There is an ""aim-assist"" mode that will line up enemies if you have trouble getting those pesky Locusts in your crosshairs. Six modes of multiplayer action offer all kinds of mission objectives beyond just killing the other team. Whether it's capturing and holding an enemy leader (while defending your own) or playing as one of the monsters against human opponents, variety will keep players entertained. Dedicated servers around the world, which will host the multiplayer games, also will be available, fulfilling a common player desire from previous ""Gears of War"" games. Developers said this should eliminate the perception that players hosting multiplayer matches had an advantage over other players. The real victory for ""Gears of War 3"" is the immersive and gripping story. Lingering questions and mysteries finally get answers, and there is a sense of finality that runs through the entire campaign. The interaction between characters never feels forced or fake. Their emotions are believable, and their concern for one another is genuine. I described it to a friend as a ""soap opera for guys,"" but it is more like a TV mini-series. The action blends well with the dialogue and creates a flow that helps pull the player along from scene to scene. It all comes off seamlessly and leaves the player emotionally invested in all of the characters. But be prepared for the unexpected as people will die and loyalties will be tested. Overall, ""Gears of War 3"" is exciting, emotional and blends competitiveness with teamwork. Whether playing the campaign alone or with friends, the story mixes with the action fluidly and provides a satisfying feeling even if the ending may not be to your liking. In multiplayer mode, the different modes offer challenges for any type of player and put a premium on strategy to achieve victory. As this trilogy ends, don't be surprised if there is more ""Gears"" action down the road. Plans for books, comics and film projects are out there, so it may not take much to enlist Delta Squad for another mission. ""Gears of War 3"" is available now in North America and Europe and will be available Thursday in Japan. It is an Xbox 360 exclusive title and rated M for mature due to blood and gore, intense violence and strong language.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- Any woman who's ever watched ""Sex and the City"" has at some point tried to guess which of the characters she's most like. The overly confident Samantha? The slightly prudish Charlotte? The pessimistic Miranda? The overanalytical Carrie? Candace Bushnell attends a fashion show during the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in September. But an honest viewer probably would have to admit that she's similar to all of the characters in some way. As a writer, that is Candace Bushnell's gift. In her books, including ""Sex and the City,"" ""4 Blondes"" and ""Lipstick Jungle,"" Bushnell has given the pop culture world feminine role models with which it can identify. And the best-selling author's newest book, ""One Fifth Avenue,"" provides a few more -- including attorney Annalisa Rice, gossip columnist Enid Merle and gold digger Lola Fabrikant. Although all of her characters are fictional, Bushnell said each one is based on a common type of person. ""I've always been interested in people. It's part of being a novelist, really, part of the job,"" she said. ""As a writer you can never know a real person as well as you know your characters.""  Watch Bushnell talk about her new book » . Bushnell said a minor character or two often will appear in several of her books. Other characters she develops in her head for years before releasing them on the literary scene. For instance, she kept one fictional character, Schiffer Diamond, under wraps for 20 years, never seeing a place where she fit in -- until ""One Fifth Avenue."" The story of a vicious scramble for a penthouse apartment once owned by a high-society queen shows the life of New York City women through the lens of where they live. One Fifth Avenue -- an actual building near Washington Square Park -- is an address that each character thinks will be her ticket to fortune. Bushnell contrasts old and new money -- and old and new media -- in the course of her tale. A New York lover herself, Bushnell looks like she belongs on a fashion walkway. Arriving at CNN in a blue dress, bright green jacket and what look like 6-inch heels, it's obvious the author isn't just a bystander of the fashion capital. But those expecting a who's who of the designer world should take another look at Bushnell's subject matter. ""My books are social satire. They have a sense of the absurd,"" Bushnell said. ""They have to say something about contemporary life."" ""One Fifth Avenue"" touches on art and antiquities theft, crosses back into the world of blogging and zips over to the stock market in less than 400 pages. Though the book is just out in stores, it was written months ago. So how did the author -- who's been celebrated in the past for her ahead-of-the-curve approach to trends -- know the economy would be such a central focus of her readers' current lives? ""I keep my eyes open,"" she said with a smile.","Candace Bushnell has a new book, ""One Fifth Avenue""

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The Pakistani Taliban has claimed responsibility for an early Wednesday morning attack on a police station that killed two officers and injured seven others, a spokesman for the militant group told CNN. Approximately 10 militants charged the police station, tossed grenades and then opened fire in the predawn attack, said senior police official Sohail Khalid. The militants escaped after an hour-long firefight with police, Khalid said. The attack took place in Dera Ismail Khan, a district that sits next to Pakistan's militant-plagued tribal region along the Afghan border. It comes one day after Pakistani Taliban spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan denied reports that the militant group had declared a cease-fire while holding peace talks with the government. Wednesday morning's attack was proof that reports of the cease-fire were false, Ehsan told CNN by phone.","About 10 militants storm the police station .

"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- In recent weeks, there have been two important stories developing about the 2012 campaign. On the surface, they have nothing to do directly with Herman Cain, Mitt Romney or Michele Bachmann. The stories revolve around money. American Crossroads, a political action committee founded by Karl Rove, is gearing up so that it can provide campaign funds to Republican candidates across the nation. The organization is determined to repeat its accomplishments in 2010, just on a much grander scale. On the other side of the aisle, there have been stories about big bundlers who are raising enormous amounts of money for President Obama's re-election campaign. According to the Huffington Post, Anna Wintour, Jeffrey Katzenberg, Jon Corzine and Harvey Weinstein are among the 100-plus bundlers who have raised more than $50 million for the president. According to the Washington Post, the financial and banking sectors have given President Obama more money than all the Republican candidates combined. Seems like Wall Street is not that scared of a second term. With all the ups and downs of the last decade, one thing has been constant. Private money continues to flood the political system. As a result of the Supreme Court's decision to eliminate the ban on corporate spending, the problem will only get worse. The vast amount of private money in American politics causes enormous problems for the nation. There are many problems that money makes it more difficult for the government to resolve. The power of private money, and the enormous influence of the interest groups and individual donors who provide it, prevents government from tackling fundamental issues of the day, including issues where there would otherwise be some agreement between the two parties. For all the talk about reducing the long-term deficit and rationalizing federal spending, the chances of accomplishing this goal are minimal unless the campaign finance system is repaired. Interest groups in Washington fight hard to defend the status quo. One of the classic examples of what political scientists called the ""iron triangle,"" â€” the ironclad alliance between interest groups, government agencies and congressional committees in defense of specific programs â€” has been the defense budget. Since the Cold War, federal dollars have gone to defense contractors who reap huge profits from the production of certain weapons systems. These companies have become integral to the economy of the communities in which their plants located, and they are protected by the legislators who represent those areas as well as Pentagon officials. Agricultural programs are another case where lobbying makes innovations or reductions in spending difficult. The congressional supercommittee dealing with deficit reduction is spinning its wheels. Indeed, The Hill reported that members of the deficit reduction committee are receiving sizable amounts of contributions from special interest groups, many of which represent sectors (such as health care) that are opposed to what the panel is attempting to accomplish. Without addressing the political dynamics that have fueled many of today's budgetary problems, it will be difficult for Congress to enact substantial changes, or to make sure that any successful reforms last over time. A second problem is the power of financial and business interests in Washington. This is a theme that preoccupies both Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street activists. Why did Wall Street receive so much assistance through TARP while homeowners have been allowed to languish? Protesters on the right and left talk about how policies are skewed toward these interests and how average middle-class Americans don't receive the same kind of attention from the nation's leaders. Business and financial interests achieve their influence in many ways. But their ability to deliver dollars to the campaign chests of candidates is crucial. Donating funds helps to ensure that these interests have a seat at the table. In 2009, as Ron Suskind recounts in his new book, ""The Confidence Men,"" Democrats learned firsthand as the health care industry successfully pushed the administration to eliminate crucial measures that were intended to control costs and save money to pay for expanded insurance. This story has been repeated in a number of policy sectors. The final problem that money fuels is gridlock. Everyone hates when Congress doesn't seem capable of doing anything. A chronic complaint about Washington is that the parties are so polarized that agreement is not possible. Money is one of the culprits. Political scientists have shown how the money race pushes politicians to seek favor with ideologically oriented interest groups and political action committees who can deliver funds. Legislators need to make sure that the party leadership in each chamber, which maintains centralized control over money through leadership political action committees, will keep the purse strings open. Campaign money makes help certain that the parties are heard. Without tackling core issues such as campaign finance, gridlock that Americans seem to dislike so much will continue. When he was a candidate, Obama constantly reminded voters about this problem. Now he seems to have become comfortable or resigned to working within the system that he once criticized. At the height of the struggle over campaign finance reform in 1973, Sen. Hubert Humphrey warned that ""it is a cesspool, it is a source of infection for the body politic."" One year later Watergate shattered American confidence in the political system. The result was burst of reform that created public finance for presidential campaigns and contribution limits, as well as the Federal Elections Commission. For almost two decades, the system worked relatively well and did produce changes until recently when both parties abandoned it. Right now there is no scandal comparable to Watergate to move American politicians. With all the attention that we pay to the horse race between Romney, Cain and Perry or the decline in President Obama's approval ratings, the fundamentals receive little attention. The basic ways in which politics works, the underlying sources of political influence and power that will have huge effects on whoever the next president is, are barely an issue. Without reform, the chances that we will see huge shifts in policy to make government more efficient and more effective are slim. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: The flood of money into U.S. politics is a scandal .
He says money from powerful interests prevents rational choices on budget cutting .
It helps explain why Wall Street got bailed out, and U.S. homeowners didn't, he says ."
"Patrick Vieira's move to Manchester City appears to have moved a step closer after Inter Milan coach Jose Mourinho confirmed he has played his last game for the Italian club.  English Premier League side City had been linked with a move for the 33-year-old midfielder who has a stop-start career at the San Siro since his move from Juventus.  Vieria played in Inter's 1-0 win over Chievo and Mourinho paid tribute to his contribution to the club after the match and confirmed his impending departure.  ""In particular Vieira was great in his last game for us. He is a player that we will certainly miss now that he is leaving,"" Mourinho told reporters.   ""It was the best way to say goodbye to us and I wish him all the best in his new life. I don't know where he is going. He doesn't have to tell anyone. England? I think so.   ""We couldn't have stopped him from leaving."" City manager Roberto Mancini revealed earlier in the week he was interested in taking the former Arsenal midfielder on loan till the end of the season. Vieira has not been a regular starter since he moved to Inter and the player will be keen to prove his fitness and form in a bid to force his way into France's squad for the World Cup in South Africa. Meanwhile Juan Sebastian Veron has rejected the chance to join City after the experienced midfielder admitted that he intends to see out his playing career at Argentinean club Estudiantes. Veron, 34, told Argentinean radio station La Red: ""I talked to Mancini, but it's not possible now. It's not about money. ""First comes my family and second it's because I made a decision and I want to respect it. This is what I feel and this is the place in which I am comfortable. ""To accept it would be going against my convictions, against myself and against the people. ""I presented the offer to the club directors so they could analyze it. But on my part there wasn't a lot to think about. My response was instant.""

"EL DORADO HILLS, California (CNN) -- The attorney for Nancy Garrido, charged in the Jaycee Lee Dugard abduction case, expressed concern Wednesday that intense media coverage may prejudice his client's ability to get a fair trial. Phillip Garrido and his wife in 1988, shortly after his release from jail for rape. ""There have been some misstatements made in the media, and possibly very innocent misstatements like, you know, 'She's charged with 29 counts, she was there, therefore she must be culpable,' "" Gilbert Maines told CNN's ""American Morning"" on Wednesday.

Nancy and Phillip Garrido have been charged in connection with the kidnapping and rape of Dugard, 29, who police say was abducted by the Garridos in 1991 at age 11.

The Garridos were arrested last week and have pleaded not guilty. Philip Garrido is a registered sex offender. Maines said his client has been charged with ""about half"" of the 29 counts against the couple. He said he has discussed ""what she says happened.""

"Paris (CNN) -- When you're in love in Paris, you show it with a lock. A combination lock, a bicycle lock or, most commonly, a simple padlock -- hundreds of them -- all inscribed with the names of lovers and clinging to the chain link railing of the Pont des Arts, the Bridge of Arts, the keys romantically tossed into the Seine flowing below. ""Without you, my life doesn't make sense,"" one of the locks reads in French. ""Walter and Tammy engaged,"" another announces to the world in English. You might easily miss the modest pedestrian bridge with the shiny accessories in the tourist rush to find historic Pont Neuf or the ornate Pont Alexandre III, but I am taking it slow on my second visit to Paris. There are no museums on my itinerary and no mad scrambles to fit in all of the city's famous sites. I've already seen the Mona Lisa, been to the top of the Eiffel Tower, gazed down on Napoleon's tomb and admired Notre Dame. This visit is for savoring Paris: walking to wherever fancy strikes, sitting in any park or café that looks inviting and eating as many baguettes, pastries and other delectable things as my budget (and figure) will allow. ""Sleepless Night"" When I arrive, ""Purple Rain"" is the talk of the town. It's the first weekend of October, so the streets of Paris are extra crowded for the annual Nuit Blanche -- White Night or Sleepless Night -- when museums stay open until dawn and organizers promise ""surprising and unusual"" art installations all over the city. One of them invites visitors to pick up a clear plastic umbrella and walk through a courtyard as rain machines and mauve lights make it look like they've stepped into Prince's hit song. I start each of my few days in Paris with champagne. It's right there, chilling in an ice bucket in the corner of my hotel's breakfast buffet every morning, not far from a pitcher of milk. Guests sip from their champagne flutes as casually as from their coffee cups as they fill up on cold cuts, cheeses and buttery croissants spread liberally with Nutella. An unexpected heat wave bathes Paris in summer light, so I take in the stunning views of the city from Sacre Coeur Basilica and go explore hilly, bohemian Montmartre. Who knew grapes grow in Paris? They bask in the sun on a slope on Rue des Saules in Clos Montmartre, the city's only vineyard. Not far away, you can feast on sea bass in butter sauce in Le Moulin de la Galette, a restaurant topped by a little 18th-century windmill -- one of only two that remain in the area. A poster quest . I take alarmingly frequent boulangerie and patisserie breaks. The bakery near my hotel, just off the Champs Elysées, has baskets of warm crunchy-soft baguettes and display cases full of elaborate sweets that you can't ignore. My favorite: a raspberry pistachio gateau, with the tart ruby fruit nestled in sweet clouds of pale green cream in between layers of flaky puff pastry. Heaven. Haunted by a poster of the Le Monde des Chimères restaurant that I've owned for years, I set out for Île Saint-Louis -- one of two islands in the Seine -- where the photo was taken. The restaurant now has a new name, Mon Vieil Ami, but I'm not disappointed. The peaceful little island, with its boutique-lined center street, is a charmer, and food temptations are all around: ""lapin à la moutarde"" (rabbit with mustard sauce), ""chocolat noir"" ice cream, ""rhubarbe"" sorbet. Close calls at Place de l'Étoile . For entertainment, I watch the crazy traffic around the Arc de Triomphe. There are no lanes and no traffic cops. Cars entering the circle have the right of way, and they roar into the giant roundabout as the other cars already in it (and going alarmingly fast) squeal to a stop, sometimes with just inches to spare. There are honks and angry hand gestures as vehicles of every imaginable size -- from tiny Smart cars to giant tour buses -- negotiate the circle with equal zeal. Want to exit the roundabout into one of the 12 avenues fanning out of it? Just cut diagonally in front of all the other traffic. It's both terrifying and fascinating to watch. When I ask the concierge at my hotel whether she drives around the arch, she smiles and shrugs her shoulders, ""Sure, you just do it. You just keep going; otherwise the other cars will just"" -- here she's at a loss for words and mimes what looks like vehicles swerving wildly around her. Her colleague at the front desk then confesses that when her husband goes around the arch, ""I just close my eyes."" They tell me that when there is an accident at the Place de l'Étoile, the insurance companies of both drivers always split the bill 50/50. It's just too difficult to ever determine who is at fault. ""But there are no accidents,"" one of the women insists. Cheese heaven . For a traffic-free experience, I head to Rue Cler, a pedestrian market street not far from the Eiffel Tower where Julia Child used to shop. You can sit down for a meal or assemble a moveable feast at the fruit, produce and specialty food shops that dot the area. The fromagerie itself is worthy of the trip: There are hundreds of varieties of cheeses for sale, their collective aroma wafting out into the street. You could make it your mission to try one cheese each day of the year and still not go through them all. For now, my time is running out. I watch one more time as the Eiffel Tower sparkles like a champagne glass at night, with the hourly evening light show eliciting oohs, aahs and applause from the crowd on the Champ de Mars. Then I give in and buy a souvenir: a ""J'adore Paris"" T-shirt. I will wear it often.","This Paris visit focuses on lots of walking, sitting and eating instead of rushing .

Scoop Marketing represents Schon. ""She stated that she was not returning home and had thus abandoned the marriage and marital home,"" his divorce petition said.

"Cairo (CNN) -- In Cairo, where huge protests are now in their fourth day, the angry protesters in Tahrir Square are reclaiming the pro-democracy revolution they started January 25. Since it took control of the management of the transitional process, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces -- appointed by the former president, Hosni Mubarak -- has been following a three-sided strategy to contain and even frustrate the persistent demands for handing over power to a civilian authority and establishing an effective democratic system. The military council is breaking the revolutionary will of the protesters by arresting many and putting them in military courts (12,000 civilians so far); deliberately humiliating them (torturing many and exposing female protesters to virginity tests); making ordinary people feel disillusioned and even hate the revolution by failing to take tough measures against anarchy and restore law and order; and finally, encouraging fragmentation and discord among the country's political actors. Like Mubarak, the military council has adopted the policy of ""me or anarchy."" Over the past few months, Egyptians have used enormous demonstrations to press their demands, starting with insisting on dismissing the government that Mubarak had appointed before he was ousted, purging the security forces and cleaning the Ministry of Interior, trying Mubarak and those responsible for the death of more than 800 peaceful protesters and the injury of thousands, and setting a clear and specific timetable for handing over power to civilians. The military council has been reluctant to respond, and when it has, it has completely emptied these demands of any meaningful effect. Indeed, it appointed a new Cabinet in March but deprived it of any effective authority. It changed the name of the state security force while maintaining its old structure and savage practices, and it reluctantly put Mubarak and some of his aides before trial, but none has been indicted, and the process has been incredibly slow. With parliamentary elections set to begin on November 28, the military council wanted to secure its position in the transitional process and threw a wrench in the form of a draft of supra-constitutional principles that, if it were to be agreed upon by the major political forces, would grant the military council a special status in the new political process. It would make the council sovereign above all other state institutions, including the parliament. The proposed principles would prevent civilian control or overseeing powers over any of the military's affairs, grant the military veto powers over the laws and strip the elected parliament of some of its authority. The document revealed the military council's insecurity about the results of the coming elections and the fear that Islamists might win a majority. It also engendered a deep state of polarization among the country's political forces. Many liberals and secularists supported the document, while Islamic parties and youth movements rejected it and organized a massive demonstration Friday under the name ""The Friday of Protecting Democracy."" Several youth and grass-roots movements joined the demonstrations and continued with sit-ins, insisting on a specific timeframe for transitioning authority. The security forces brutally cracked down on the protesters, igniting further clashes over the past few days. To many protesters, what Egypt is witnessing is ""phase two"" of the January revolution. One cannot ignore the striking similarities between the two phases, particularly the snail-paced responses of the military council and Mubarak and the unjustifiable use of force against unarmed civilians. I was in Tahrir Square on Saturday when army soldiers clamped down on thousands of peaceful protesters, killing two in their initial thrust and savagely beating many of them. This excessive use of force was a major factor contributing to the fall of Mubarak. The military council also repeats another fatal mistake by responding too late with too little, leading protesters to raise the ceiling of their demands. What started as protests calling for protecting democracy and a timetable for transferring power under the management of the military council has become firm demands for ending the rule of the council and the military generals. Despite this revolutionary situation, and perhaps because of it, Egypt has great hopes in transitioning to democracy. Several steps need to be taken. The military council needs to bring to justice those responsible for the death and injury of peaceful protesters, including the immediate dismissal of the minister of interior and his aides. A new national salvation government has to be formed of credible public figures to manage the transitional process -- writing a new constitution, restoring order and reviving the country's economy. Finally, sticking to a clear road map that allows timely legislative elections to be held under the immediate supervision of the newly formed government, followed by presidential elections, would position Egypt on a stable path toward democratic transition. The military council might try to exploit this precarious situation to impose martial law and postpone or even cancel the parliamentary elections. This will prove counterproductive and, in fact, disastrous because Egyptians will then have nothing to lose and will continue with their revolution to end military rule and earn their democracy.

"(CNN) -- Natalie Wood was terrified of the water. As an 11-year-old shooting ""The Green Promise,"" she was thrown off a bridge during a storm scene and nearly drowned. The incident scarred her for life. Thirty-two years later, Wood died after falling into the ocean off Catalina Island in California. Wood's life is full of such curiosities. She was that rare child performer to make the transition to adult movie star, but her rise to success was marked by troubled relationships. She had beauty and talent, but she suffered from alcohol abuse and once tried to commit suicide. And then there's her death, coming just as she was restarting her movie career. Wood, who died in 1981, is back in the news after police reopened the case involving her drowning at age 43. Police: Robert Wagner not a suspect in new probe of Natalie Wood's death . The story surrounding Wood's death has long been one of Hollywood's great mysteries. She was making a motion picture comeback in a highly touted science-fiction film, ""Brainstorm,"" and was on her yacht with her husband, Robert Wagner, and her co-star, Christopher Walken. Aspects of Wood's life have only heightened the speculation. How could someone so young, with a good marriage and revitalized career, die just like that? Captain describes Wood cover-up story . Wood had been a top star for decades, both a box office draw and Oscar-nominated actress. Among her films were some of the biggest and most influential of the 1950s and '60s, including ""Rebel Without a Cause,"" ""West Side Story"" and ""Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice."" ""It was as if she had movie star stamped on her birth certificate,"" Wagner once said. Indeed, she seemed fated for stardom from the beginning. Wood was born Natalia Nikolaevna Zakharenko, daughter of Russian immigrants, in San Francisco in 1938. The family later changed their last name to Gurdin. At age 4, she had a bit part in 1943's ""Happy Land"" after a production company spotted her in nearby Santa Rosa. Her mother, intent on her daughter making it in the movie business, moved the family to Los Angeles, and young Natalia, renamed Natalie Wood by the studio, soon earned a role in the 1946 Orson Welles film ""Tomorrow Is Forever."" Welles was impressed with the scene-stealing youngster. ""She's terrifying!"" he's said to have described her. (Wood's sister, Lana, also did well, later playing Plenty O'Toole in the James Bond film ""Diamonds Are Forever."") From the late '40s until the mid-'50s, she was one of the most active child performers in the movie business, appearing in such films as 1947's ""The Ghost and Mrs. Muir"" and 1950's ""Never a Dull Moment."" But for several years she was best known as the Santa Claus-believing child in 1947's ""Miracle on 34th Street,"" opposite Maureen O'Hara and Edmund Gwenn. She later looked back at her childhood years with pain and a little fury. ""I spent practically all my time in the company of adults. I was very withdrawn, very shy, I did what I was told and I tried not to disappoint anybody. I knew I had a duty to perform, and I was trained to follow orders,"" she once said. Her relationship with her mother was often bitter. Glamour to spare . It wasn't until the groundbreaking ""Rebel Without a Cause"" (1955), also starring James Dean and Sal Mineo, that she broke through into mature roles. The film featured Wood as the girlfriend of Dean's angst-ridden Jim Stark in the role that made Dean a generational symbol. Wood was nominated for a best supporting actress Oscar for her performance. But it was two 1961 films, the film version of the Broadway smash ""West Side Story"" and the romantic tragedy ""Splendor in the Grass,"" that made her a top-tier movie star. In ""West Side Story,"" a version of ""Romeo and Juliet"" set among New York's gang culture, Wood played Maria, the ill-fated heroine. Though her singing voice was dubbed, her performance earned her good reviews in what became one of the most lauded movies of all time. ""Splendor in the Grass"" was no slouch, either; for her performance opposite Warren Beatty, Wood picked up an Oscar nomination for best actress. The press paid attention. Wood had glamour to spare; she was often touted, along with Elizabeth Taylor and Sophia Loren, as one of the most beautiful actresses in Hollywood. She also had a photogenic marriage to the hunky Wagner, whom she had married in 1957 when she was 18 and he was 27. The marriage was one of the most celebrated of its time. ""We drove a Corvette across the country. Radio stations would announce we had just passed through, and people would wait for us in every little town,"" Wood told People magazine in 1976. But that marriage to Wagner didn't last; the pair divorced in 1962. She married her second husband, agent Richard Gregson, in 1969. The two had a daughter, Natasha. There were some dark moments -- Wood attempted suicide in 1966 -- but on the whole she gained confidence as an actress in the '60s. (Hardcore psychoanalysis -- she went almost daily for several years -- didn't hurt.) She was named ""Star of the Year"" by theater owners in 1963 and appeared in a series of popular films, including ""Gypsy"" (1962), ""Sex and the Single Girl"" (1963) and ""The Great Race"" (1965). Though she turned down some challenging roles, including one in ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" she bounced back with the wife-swapping comedy ""Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice"" (1969), for which she earned a reputed $3 million (thanks to shrewdly taking a cut of the profits). However, except for a handful of roles, ""Bob & Carol"" also marked the end of a chapter in Wood's film career. She divorced Gregson in 1972 and, having reconciled with Wagner, remarried him later that year. She told People that she had few qualms about putting her career on the back burner. ""If a woman decides to get married and have children, other parts of her life are just going to have to be put aside,"" she said. By many accounts, she and Wagner had a stronger marriage the second time around. They had a daughter, Courtney, and stood out as one of Hollywood's power couples. Wood stayed busy with the occasional TV movie. Troubled production, mysterious end . ""Brainstorm"" earned coverage not only for Wood's casting -- it was just her third theatrical movie since ""Bob & Carol"" -- but also for its technological trappings. The director, Douglas Trumbull, was renowned for his special-effects work on ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" and the movie was being shot in a special format. But ""Brainstorm"" was plagued by production troubles, and rumors started circulating about Wood and Walken's relationship, as TCM.com notes in its writeup of the film. Wagner, who visited the North Carolina set during a break from his TV series ""Hart to Hart,"" had suspicions. ""The bell wasn't exactly clanging, but I was aware that I didn't have her full attention,"" he wrote in his 2008 memoir. ""She was more involved with the movie than she was with her family, and the thought occurred to me that Natalie was being emotionally unfaithful."" Filming continued in Hollywood, and during the Thanksgiving holiday, Wagner and Wood invited Walken to relax on their boat, Splendour, named for ""Splendor in the Grass."" The rest is lost in the murky water off the California coast on November 29, 1981, when Wood died. At her funeral, her pallbearers included Frank Sinatra, Fred Astaire, Laurence Olivier and Gregory Peck. The aftermath affected lives well away from the boat. The studio wanted to shut down filming; Trumbull had to find other financing to complete the movie. Upon its 1983 release, ""Brainstorm"" was a box office dud, and Trumbull never directed another film. Dr. Thomas Noguchi, the Los Angeles County coroner, was demoted in 1982 after an investigation by the county board of supervisors over issues with his job, including publicity-seeking after the deaths of celebrities. Wagner mourned Wood's death for years before marrying Jill St. John, one of Wood's closest friends, in 1990. Though her image has faded in comparison with some of her contemporaries, such as Taylor or Dean, she's still looked up to by young actresses. Vanessa Hudgens, the ""High School Musical"" star, calls Wood her ""idol."" Wood herself was blunt about her impact. ""Let's face it, acting is not important. Einstein is important. Jonas Salk is important. I know they're not going to send my latest movie up in a time capsule,"" she once said. What she desired, apparently, was more out of life. Some time before her death she gave an interview and was asked if she was satisfied. After all, she had two children, a terrific husband, fame, money and beauty. What more could she want? She didn't hesitate: ""I want yesterday.""","Natalie Wood was major movie star, considered one of world's most beautiful and talented .

"(CNN) -- As last night's Republican presidential debate over national security issues demonstrated, credibility is crucial to winning a debate. Think of credibility like money you have in a bank. Each time you stretch it thin, you have less the next time you might need it. It is your own personal bank of believability. Knowing your arguments and facts is one way to gain credibility. Mitt Romney fattened his credibility bank account at the expense of Rick Perry, who supported a no fly zone over Syria. Romney argued that a no fly zone over Syria would be pointless since the Syrian government has 5,000 tanks. Romney jokingly said it would make more sense to impose a ""no drive zone."" Jon Huntsman made a similar deposit when he stated that sanctions on Iran would not work since ""the Chinese aren't going to play ball and the Russians aren't going to play ball,"" and Iran has already decided to go nuclear. Huntsman's cited the examples of Libya (which gave up its nuclear ambition, and later the government was overthrown with the help of the United States) and North Korea (which has tested nuclear weapons and whose government is still in power.) Another way to maintain credibility is to cite proof for your arguments. Michele Bachmann has said things in previous debates (President Obama wants Medicare to collapse) and in last night's debate (suggesting that the CIA cannot interrogate terrorist suspects any longer because the ACLU is in charge) that were not very credible. These frequent ATM withdrawals hurt Bachmann because a lack of believability spills over. Her disagreement with Rick Perry about whether to give aid to Pakistan should have been an excellent point for her. She showcased her knowledge of the subject, saying that we exchange intelligence information and the United States must have our interest represented. Bachmann called Pakistan ""too nuclear to fail,"" and chastised Perry for being naÃ¯ve when he said he would not give Pakistan one penny until it proved it had America's best interests in mind. This was a terrific answer that warranted applause because it was thoughtful, logical and well reasoned. What did she get? Crickets. Why? Because her believability bank is in the red. Ron Paul is an enigma. He can provide such thoughtful answers at one time and later interject completely unsubstantiated statements. He was banking responsibly with his argument that the war on drugs was a failure and a reason for much of the violence in Mexico. Paul reminded us that prescription drugs kill many more people than illegal drugs do and that alcohol is a deadly drug. Paul's argument was factually accurate, even if unpopular with many conservatives. But then Paul writes an overdraft with moderate Republicans by saying things like aid to Africa for malaria or AIDS prevention is ""all worthless."" Paul hit the daily double. Unpopular answer? Check. Wrong on facts? Check. There are countless examples of disease prevention aid being effective. Could aid be more effective? Sure. But that was not Paul's answer. He simply asserted that aid is worthless, but he had no proof. Answering questions with non-answers simply isn't credible. For example, Herman Cain twice last night reached into a very old bag of tricks to answer questions with the standard ""I'd consult the experts"" line. Actually, he originally answered a question about terrorist profiling with his support of ""targeted identification."" But when asked a follow-up not 20 seconds later, he retreated by saying he would ""ask the professionals."" Nothing hurts your credibility worse than flip-flopping on the same question and diving into a non-answer. Cain's bank account is probably under a thousand dollars. But that still leaves him 999. Finally, to save credibility, you should be prepared to defend your position when giving a potentially unpopular answer. Newt Gingrich had two answers that the conservative wing of his party might not like, but he defended them well. Gingrich said it was possible to cut some of the military because, ""If it takes 15 to 20 years to build a weapons system when Apple changes technology every nine months, there's something profoundly wrong with the system."" And Gingrich went against the Republican current when he stated that some long-term illegal immigrants should be allowed to stay legally, but without citizenship, in the United States. Romney and others said giving amnesty would be a magnet for more people to come illegally to the United States. Gingrich said we should be humane, and he was ready to take the heat for his stance. Gingrich has enough credibility banked because of his stances on other issues that he was able to withstand the criticism on this one. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Todd Graham.","Todd Graham: Key currency in debates is your stock of credibility .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Banana producer Chiquita will pay a $25 million fine and serve five years' probation for once paying millions of dollars to groups in Colombia considered by the U.S. to be terrorist organizations, a Department of Justice spokesman said Tuesday. A worker at a banana plantation in Santa Maria, Colombia, in December 2000. In so doing, the banana producer avoided prosecution for the company's now-defunct payoff of Colombian terrorists protecting its most profitable banana-growing operation, according to terms of a plea agreement with the U.S. Justice Department. If approved by U.S. courts, the $25 million fine would represent the largest U.S. criminal penalty ever imposed under federal global terrorism sanction regulations, said Justice spokesman Dean Boyd. The regulations prohibit transactions with people who commit, threaten to commit or support U.S.-designated terrorists and establish penalties for doing so. Attorneys from the Justice Department's National Security Division and federal prosecutors for the District of Columbia filed a joint sentencing motion Tuesday asking the court to accept the plea agreement, which was reached March 19, Boyd said. A hearing on the matter is set for Monday. In its motion, the government asked that Chiquita Brands International be fined and sentenced to probation, as well as being required to implement an effective ethics program in connection with the company's guilty plea, Boyd said. Federal prosecutors accused the Cincinnati-based company of paying more than $1.7 million to the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, a right-wing paramilitary group, in two parts of Colombia where the company grew bananas. The payments to the group, known as the AUC, went through the company's Colombian subsidiary, Banadex, from 1997 to 2004, according to court documents filed in the case. Court papers also say Chiquita paid Colombia's two leftist guerrilla groups, the FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) and ELN (National Liberation Army) from about 1989 to 1997. At the time, according to court documents, those groups controlled areas where the company grew bananas. The AUC, FARC and ELN are all combatants in Colombia's decade-long civil war, and all have been designated as terrorist organizations by the United States. In a written statement issued in March, Chiquita Brands International CEO Fernando Aguirre said the company viewed the plea agreement ""as a reasoned solution to the dilemma the company faced several years ago."" The company voluntarily disclosed the payments to the Justice Department in 2003, he said, adding the payments were made ""to protect the lives of its employees."" Court documents said the company began making the payments after a Banadex general manager met with the then-leader of the AUC, Carlos Castano. Castano told the manager that the AUC was preparing to drive FARC from Colombia's Uraba region and asked for payments to be made to the AUC through private security companies. ""Castano sent an unspoken but clear message that failure to make the payments could result in physical harm to Banadex personnel and property,"" court documents said. Charges filed in the case said senior company executives knew about the payments to the AUC and, while checks were written to the security companies, the companies provided no actual services. In 2002, after the U.S. government designated the AUC as a terrorist organization, Chiquita began paying the organization in cash, according to court documents, and continued the payments even after being told by outside counsel that the payments were illegal and should be stopped. In the motion filed Tuesday, federal prosecutors noted Chiquita's cooperation in the investigation and its voluntary disclosure of its illegal activity, Boyd said. While the government considered filing additional charges in the matter, it decided not to ""after an extensive investigation and after considering critical evidence and information that Chiquita provided through its post-plea cooperation,"" he said. Chiquita sold Banadex to another company more than two years ago but remains one of the largest purchasers of bananas in Colombia. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- For the first time in a few years, talk about airline bankruptcies has ramped up once again, with concerns expressed this week about a certain carrier based in Texas. Whether the reports about American Airlines are true or not doesn't really matter -- it's enough to make people anxious. I've received a fair bit of e-mail this last week asking what happens if bankruptcy becomes a reality. In short, there's nothing to worry about with an airline like American, but I thought it would be a good idea to devote this week's column to the issue since it's at the top of mind for many travelers. Will American go bankrupt? I'm certainly not qualified to answer that question. Only the airline itself knows its plans, but the balance sheet certainly doesn't point to bankruptcy being necessary in the short to medium term. Yes, American has been losing money recently while others have profited, but at the end of June, it had more than $5 billion in the bank and it has been able to arrange financing since then. That doesn't sound like a company that would be filing for bankruptcy protection, which should be a last resort. Even if it does for some strategic reason, flights wouldn't be affected. Still, it's worth talking about what to do when an airline goes bankrupt, because airlines around the world shut down every year. It's always good to know what you can do. Here is some advice. Always pay with a credit card . When you buy a ticket, you might be paying for something (a flight, presumably) that you won't use for another year. That's a long time for an airline to hold on to your money, and that's why you should pay with a credit card. If you buy a ticket with a credit card, then you won't be on the hook if your airline goes under. In fact, when airlines start to find themselves in financial trouble, credit card processors hold back a larger and larger percentage of the money until the flight occurs. That way, if the airline doesn't perform, the credit card company still has your money and can give it right back to you. Periodically check in on your airline . It sounds silly when you're talking about an airline like American, because you would know instantly if it filed for bankruptcy protection. But what if you bought a ticket on Kuwait-based Wataniya Airways? Would you even know that it shut down in March of this year? Probably not. So if you do find yourself booked on an airline that might not be very well known here in the U.S., it can't hurt to check in every so often to make sure it's still flying. Most airlines with websites are very good at letting you know when they go out of business. Even better, you can set up an alert via Google that will send you a note anytime an airline's name pops up in the news. This is hardly necessary for the better-known airlines around the world, of course, but it's a good idea for smaller airlines that you want to keep an eye on. Have a backup plan . If you're worried about an airline going out of business for one reason or another, have a mental backup plan waiting in case you need to spring into action. Find out what other airlines fly where you need to go, and be ready to try to pounce if something happens. If you're prepared, you'll be able to get that last seat on your alternate before someone else who was unprepared even knows what's happening. But you'll still have to pay for it. Don't expect help from other airlines . There used to be a rule in the U.S. that other airlines had to honor tickets on failed airlines for a nominal fee. That doesn't exist anymore, so don't go looking for charity from other airlines if yours goes under. Elsewhere in the world, there can be varying levels of assistance, but it's best to just assume that you'll get none. At best, you'll be lucky to find an airline that will take you on standby, but that's not necessarily helpful for people with set plans. Ultimately, the best advice is to just be alert. If your airline stops flying, act quickly to find the best alternate options, and you'll still get where you need to go. But if you're worried about a big airline failing here in the U.S., I wouldn't get too worked up about it. The chances of that are incredibly slim, even if bankruptcy is involved.","Travelers worry as bankruptcy fears swirl around American Airlines .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- A woman charged with sending threatening packages to two lawmakers, including a U.S. representative, was killed Sunday after she tried to attack a police officer at her home near Atlanta, police and the lawmakers said Monday. Jameela Barnette, 53, was armed with a knife and handgun when a police officer knocked on her door on Christmas morning as he responded to reports of an alarm inside, Cobb County Police said. She opened the door and started assaulting the officer with the weapons, police said. The officer shot her, and Barnette died at the scene. Barnette was the same woman who sent threatening packages earlier this year to U.S. Rep. Peter King of New York and New York State Sen. Greg Ball, their offices said Monday. Barnette was indicted in U.S. District Court in Atlanta in October on two counts of sending threatening packages. She pleaded not guilty in November and was released on $20,000 bond, according to court records. Earlier this month, the court also ordered Barnette to undergo a mental evaluation. The package sent to Ball contained a hoax weapon of mass destruction, said Ball spokeswoman Brittany Oat. The indictment said it contained threatening messages and a vial of an unknown liquid, labeled ""Zyklon B,"" which Barnette indicated was a biological agent or toxin. The vial of liquid was in fact perfume oil, according to CNN affiliate WXXA-TV in Albany, the New York state capital, which spoke to Barnette in April. The package also contained a toy monkey wearing the Star of David, as shown in photos released by Ball's office. Barnette told WXXA-TV she was a grandmother and a Muslim upset with Ball for holding hearings earlier this year on New York City's vulnerability to terrorism. ""He keeps messing with Muslims,"" Barnette told the station in April. ""Muslims have not been harassing anyone."" Barnette said she was not a threat and did not want people to think she was a dangerous person for sending the package. A representative for Barnette could not be reached Monday. Also in April, Barnette sent a bloody severed pig's foot and note to King's office on Capitol Hill, King said Monday. The package never reached King or his staffers because all mail to the U.S. Capitol is screened. The note was laced with anti-Semitic rants, including statements such as ""evil Jews will return this hoof to Palestine,"" a congressional source familiar with the situation said at the time. King is not Jewish. ""The woman, who called me a 'Muslim basher,' wrote 'kiss my black Muslim ass,'"" King said in a statement Monday. ""I believe this was all a result of the blind and false hysteria stirred up by opponents of the radicalization hearings I convened in March,"" King said. The officer who fired on Barnette on Sunday was treated for his injury and released at the scene, and is now on administrative leave pending investigation, according to the police department in suburbuan Atlanta. CNN's Ashley Corum, Carol Cratty, Sara Pratley, and Melissa Gray contributed to this report.","The woman, Jameela Barnette, was killed as she tried to attack an officer, police said .

"(Health.com)  -- Doctors often recommend exercise for patients with fibromyalgia, but the chronic pain and fatigue associated with the condition can make activities like running and swimming difficult. Tai chi -- a slow, meditative martial art -- may be an effective alternative, a new study suggests. Fibromyalgia patients who took tai chi classes twice a week for three months experienced less pain, stiffness, and fatigue than a control group that attended lifestyle education and stretching sessions, according to the study, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Tai chi involves a series of slow, fluid movements that focus on balance and deep breathing. Although it's not clear from the study how exactly tai chi might improve fibromyalgia symptoms, both the physical activity and the meditative aspects are likely beneficial, says Chenchen Wang, M.D., the lead researcher and an associate professor at the Tufts University School of Medicine, in Boston, Massachusetts. ""Some people need the physical improvement; some people need more mental improvement,"" she says. ""Tai chi can help with both."" Health.com: How fibromyalgia is diagnosed . Previous research has shown that tai chi can help relieve the symptoms of arthritis and other pain conditions, but this study is the first controlled trial to examine its effectiveness as a treatment for fibromyalgia, which affects an estimated 10 million Americans. The study included 66 fibromyalgia patients who were randomly assigned to take one-hour tai chi classes with an experienced teacher or one-hour classes that taught coping skills, pain-management techniques, and stretching. Participants were also asked to practice tai chi or stretch on their own for 20 minutes each day, depending on which group they were in. Health.com: 13 mistakes fibro patients make . After three months,  Wang and her colleagues asked the patients to rate their pain symptoms, physical functioning, fatigue, and mood, all of which were combined on a single scale ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms. (The patients completed the same survey before the study began.) The average score among the tai chi patients dropped from 63 to 35, while the average for the control group dropped by just nine points, from 68 to 59. Three months after the sessions stopped, the scores had remained roughly the same, which suggests that the benefits of the tai chi were lasting, Wang says. The results were encouraging, as existing fibromyalgia treatments -- including medication, sleep therapy, and aerobic exercise -- fail to help many patients. ""We need another approach,"" says Wang. Health.com: Medical marijuana may help fibromyalgia pain . Robert Shmerling, M.D., an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and the clinical chief of rheumatology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, in Boston, says that he often recommends alternative treatments, such as acupuncture and massage, to his fibromyalgia patients, although some of them are skeptical. ""I would certainly put tai chi on the list,"" says Shmerling, who co-wrote an editorial that accompanies the study. ""It's difficult to take something that's as safe as tai chi and show that it has this dramatic benefit and not be enthusiastic about it."" The calming style of tai chi used in the study, known as Yang, may be especially effective for fibromyalgia patients, says Kim D. Jones, Ph.D., an associate professor at the Oregon Health & Science University School of Nursing, in Portland. ""It works more on the parasympathetic nervous system, ...the part of the nervous system that helps us feel calm and relaxed,"" says Jones, who studies Yang-style tai chi and yoga in fibromyalgia but wasn't involved in the study. Health.com: 13 conditions that mimic fibromyalgia . Jones recommends that fibromyalgia patients find a well-trained instructor rather than trying tai chi on their own. She points out that learning tai chi in a group may have its own therapeutic benefits, by boosting confidence, for instance. Many community centers offer affordable tai chi classes, but experienced teachers can be expensive and hard to come by. However, if future studies support the benefits of tai chi, insurance companies might start to cover the practice, Shmerling says.

"Washington (CNN) -- A 90-year-old Michigan man who officials say rounded up and shot Jews in Nazi death camps during World War II is a step closer to being deported, the Justice Department announced Tuesday. In January, a judge found John Kalymon of Troy, Michigan, to have been an armed member of the Nazi-sponsored Ukrainian Auxiliary Police from 1941 to 1944. Tuesday, an appeals board dismissed Kalymon's attempt to block his deportation from the United States. Kalymon immigrated to America from Germany in 1949 and became a U.S. citizen in 1955. A federal judge in Detroit revoked his U.S. citizenship in 2007. ""John Kalymon and his Ukrainian Police accomplices were indispensable participants in Nazi Germany's campaign to exterminate the Jews of Europe during World War II,"" said Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer. Breuer said tens of thousands of Jewish men, women and children were murdered in L'viv or rounded up and shipped to the Nazi death camp in Belzec or to Nazi forced labor camps. In a news release last month, the Justice Department said Kalymon ""personally shot Jews while serving, killing at least one"" and ""participated in violent anti-Jewish operations in which Jews were forcibly deported to be murdered in gas chambers and to serve as slave laborers."" ""This case is one of more than a hundred cases successfully prosecuted by the Department of Justice against wartime Nazi perpetrators,"" said Eli Rosenbaum, head of the Justice Department's Nazi-hunting unit. Rosenbaum said that since the government launched its program to find and deport former Nazis in 1979, 107 individuals have been prosecuted, and 180 suspected Axis persecutors who attempted to enter the United States have been blocked from doing so. Although authorities believe only a small number of former Nazis -- mostly in their 90s -- remain alive in the United States, the government is determined to keep up the hunt and deport those they find. Rosenbaum said the program ""reflects the government's continuing commitment to pursuing justice on behalf of the victims of the Holocaust and other human rights crimes.""","John Kalymon was a member of a Nazi-backed police unit, a court has found .

"JERUSALEM (CNN) -- Israel has expelled Venezuela's ambassador in response to Venezuela's expulsion of an Israeli envoy and the rupture of diplomatic relations earlier this month. A pro-Palestinian mural in the Venezuelan capital, Caracas. Venezuelan head of mission Roland Betancourt and two other diplomats were given until Friday to leave. ""Due to the decision of Venezuela to cut relations with us a few weeks ago, we told the Venezuelan charge d'affaires that he and his staff should leave Israel,"" Foreign Ministry official Lior Hayat said. ""We told them they are declared persona non grata in Israel."" Venezuela expelled Israeli Ambassador Shlomo Cohen and staff on January 6 and broke off diplomatic relations on January 14 in protest of Israel's attack on Gaza. Bolivia also broke off relations with Israel that day. Venezuelan Foreign Minister Nicolas Maduro defended his country's actions, saying Israel violated basic human rights with its military action. ""Our decisions were just, correct, aligned with and adjusted with the spirit of our constitution, which mandates that we seek international peace,"" Maduro said in a statement on the foreign ministry's Web site. Maduro said Venezuela's actions are compatible with its support for the creation of a Palestinian state. He has not spoken, he said, with any Israeli officials over this week's expulsion of the Venezuelan diplomats. ""The response of the state of Israel is weak, late, and in any case for us it's an honor,"" Maduro told the Qatar-based television network Al-Jazeera. ""We're proud that the state of Israel that exists today, led by these criminals, made this decision."" Israel and Venezuela have had diplomatic tensions before. Israel recalled its ambassador to Venezuela in August 2006 ""in protest against the one-sided policy of the president of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, in light of his outrageous defamatory remarks against the state of Israel, and in reaction to the recalling of the Venezuela ambassador to Israel,"" the foreign ministry said at the time. A January 21 cease-fire put an end to fighting between Hamas militants in Gaza and Israel, which had launched a three-week offensive, saying its goal was to stop missile strikes into southern Israel. More than 1,200 Palestinians, many of them civilians, were killed. Israel lost about 10 soldiers and three civilians.","Venezuelan ambassador to Israel and two others expelled .

"Washington (CNN) -- Violent crime in the United States continues to drop significantly despite the difficult economic environment, according to new statistics released Friday by the Justice Department. According to the Crime Victimization Survey released annually by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, in 2010 violent crimes dropped about 13% among U.S. residents ages 12 or older. Crime has been declining for several years, but the decline reported by the survey for past year was about three times as great as annual declines recorded by the same survey during the previous nine years. The Justice Department attributed much of the decline to a sharp drop in the number of simple assaults. Criminologists have repeatedly told CNN in recent years the declining figures are surprising inasmuch as crime has historically increased in times of economic stress. A clearer picture of crime in the United States is likely to emerge from a major FBI report scheduled for release Monday morning. The closely watched FBI Uniform Crime Report also is expected to show a continuing drop in violent crime throughout 2010. That report, based on detailed reporting by all of the nation's police agencies, provides breakdowns in all subcategories of crime. A preliminary FBI report for the first half of 2010 showed a decline in violent crime of 5.5 percent. That is expected to hold up for the entire calendar year. The Justice Department Victimization Survey, which provides numbers of victims based on an extensive telephone survey, does not include statistics for murder. It cites figures for rape, robbery, aggravated assault and simple assault. Almost two-thirds of violent crime ""victimizations"" occurring during 2010 were simple assaults in which the victim did not suffer an injury, the Justice Department survey found.","The annual Crime Victimization Survey shows a 13% drop in violent crimes .

"(CNN) -- Let's face it; most awards shows can be pretty dull. It's not that we don't tune in to every single one, of course, but it's always a pleasant surprise when the ceremony is actually fun to watch. Last night's Emmy Awards hosted by Jane Lynch not only honored Emmy shoo-ins like ""The Daily Show,"" ""Mad Men"" and ""Modern Family"" and fan favorite ""Friday Night Lights"" alike, but also brought the laughs. Here are our top five funniest moments. 1. Leading ladies storm the stage . As soon as Sofia Vergara and Rob Lowe presented the nominees for outstanding lead actress in a comedy, Amy Poehler, whose name was read first for ""Parks and Recreation'"" smiled at the camera and then promptly ran up onto the stage before any of the other nominees -- let alone the winner -- was announced. As Vergara and Lowe continued to read names, each of Poehler's fellow funny women, Melissa McCarthy (""Mike and Molly""), Martha Plimpton (""Raising Hope""), Edie Falco (""Nurse Jackie""), Tina Fey (""30 Rock"") and Laura Linney (""The Big C"") joined her on stage. The group lined up and held hands in their best beauty pageant re-enactment while waiting for the big reveal -- a bit which received a standing ovation from the audience. To top off an already stellar and hilarious display of female solidarity, when McCarthy won the Emmy she not only received genuine smiles and big hugs from the rest of the women, but also walked away with a bouquet of roses and a tiara as a bonus. ""Wow, it's my first and best pageant ever!"" McCarthy said. 2. All-star 'Office' Back from commercial break, viewers were treated to a sketch where characters from different shows all popped up at the Dunder-Mifflin office to discuss their least favorite thing about their jobs. There was Tom Haverford from ""Parks and Recreation,"" Tracy Jordan from ""30 Rock,"" Roger Sterling from ""Mad Men"" and Jesse Pinkman from ""Breaking Bad"" (who we learn is Creed's crystal meth dealer) and more. Kim Kardashian showed up, but even she was a little confused as to why. ""I'm sorry, I'm not sure I get the question,"" she deadpanned. ""What do you mean by work? Am I saying that word right? Work?"" Finally, we see Ashton Kutcher in Michael Scott's old office, but the rest of the staff is sure this is a mistake. ""I'm pretty sure that I'm taking over as the new lead,"" Kutcher said. When Ed Helms tells him that's for a different show and this isn't Warner Brothers lot, it all clicks for Kutcher. ""Oh, I was wondering where the half man was!"" 3. Jane Lynch's shortest, sweetest zinger . ""A lot of people are curious why I'm a lesbian. Ladies and gentleman ... the cast of Entourage."" 4. Steven Levitan's wife . When Steve Levitan and Jeffrey Rich of ""Modern Family"" won for outstanding writing in a comedy series, it was a safe bet that the speech would be funny. But viewers weren't expecting Levitan's wife Krista's perfect, comedic timing to steal the show. When Levitan explained that the inspiration for the winning episode was when his children walked in on him and his wife ""in the act,"" Krista looked directly at the camera and rolled her eyes. Later in the speech when Levitan went back to the mic to thank his ""somewhat-satisfied wife,"" she reprised the disgruntled eye roll and forever cemented a place in our hearts. 5. Remote Ricky Gervais . Just when we thought all the joke mileage that could be gotten out of Ricky Gervais' Golden Globes hosting controversy had run out ages ago, he once again faced some of the celebs he slammed -- albeit in an Emmy pre-recorded message. ""Sorry I can't be there live in person,"" he said. ""Not allowed. In fact, now during any awards ceremony, I'm not even allowed on American soil. And the Emmy bosses have warned me that if I say anything rude or controversial, they will edit it out and you won't know the difference."" He then began to deliver a speech full of obvious jump-cut edits when he veered into potentially dangerous territory, like when he said some shows that had beaten him out for Emmys were, in his opinion, absolute ... ""Schindler's List."" What were your favorite moments of the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards? Tell us in the comments below.","Amy Poehler, smiled at the camera and then promptly ran up onto the stage .

"(CNN) -- Syria has until Friday to agree to let Arab League observers into the country to monitor the government's response to civil unrest or else face economic sanctions from its neighbors, a senior Arab League diplomat said Thursday. Syria's membership in the 22-country Arab League was suspended this month after President Bashar al-Assad's regime ignored demands to end its crackdown on citizens. ""If they do not comply, then the league's economic body will file a report to the foreign ministers of the league who will meet on Sunday to vote on the economic sanctions to be implemented,"" said the diplomat, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the negotiations with Syria. If Syria agrees by the Friday deadline, then the league will send a delegation to Damascus to discuss details of the observer mission before the team goes, the diplomat said. At least 35 people died Thursday in clashes with security forces, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria (LCC) activist group said. Another activist group, the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, reported earlier that at least 11 Syrian military defectors were shot dead and four injured during clashes with regular Syrian army units in the area. A further 73 civilians were arrested in Homs province Thursday, the group said. A campaign of raids and arrests is also taking place in the Damascus suburb of Domeir, the Qalet Mudeeq neighborhood in Hama, and Baniyas, the LCC said. Funerals were held Thursday for 12 army, police and security forces personnel, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported. The 12 had been targeted by ""armed terrorist groups"" while on duty in the Damascus, Homs and Hama areas, the news agency said. The United Nations says more than 3,500 people have been killed in the government's eight-month crackdown on pro-democracy protests. Al-Assad has resisted mounting calls for his resignation as president in recent weeks as international outcry over the Syrian violence has intensified. On Tuesday, the humanitarian committee of the U.N. General Assembly voted by a large majority to condemn the violence in Syria and express its support for the Arab League initiative. It was the first resolution on Syria's crackdown to be approved at the United Nations. Protesters in Syria are demanding al-Assad's ouster and democratic elections. He has been in power since 2000, following his father, Hafez, who ruled Syria for three decades. Syria's government has said it is fighting armed terrorists, and it maintains that the death toll is much lower than international observers and opposition groups say. CNN's Lonzo Cook and Tracy Doueiry contributed to this report.","NEW: At least 35 people have died in violence Thursday, an activist group says .

"(CNN) -- After months of bloodshed, intrigue and revenge that made Yemen seem like an Arabian version of Hamlet, President Ali Abdullah Saleh has finally transferred his powers to his vice president, and elections are to be held in three months. At the ceremony in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to seal the transition deal worked out by the Gulf Cooperation Council, Saleh seemed relaxed and even chuckled as he signed several copies of the agreement, the result of intense diplomatic shuttling by U.N. envoy Jamal bin Omar and growing pressure from the international community. But Saleh also took a parting shot at his opponents, saying they had destroyed in months everything that had been built over years. April Longley Alley, Yemen analyst at the International Crisis Group, says the Riyadh deal offers an ""opportunity to move past the current political impasse and to deal with critical issues like deteriorating economic and humanitarian conditions as well as the very difficult task of institutional reform."" Even so, Longley Alley and other analysts expect the epilogue to be anything but predictable. There are plenty of competing elements left behind: the thousands of mainly young demonstrators who took to the streets of Sanaa and other cities in January to demand democratic change, the tribal alliance that took up arms against Saleh, secessionists in the south and a Shiite rebellion in the north, well-organized Islamist groups and a budding al Qaeda franchise. Perhaps the most powerful figure in Yemen now is Brig. Gen. Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar, commander of the 1st Armored Division. He defected in March and took a chunk of the army with him. His units now control northern districts of the capital and are facing off against powerful remnants of the Saleh clan. The president's son, Ahmed Ali Abdullah Saleh, long groomed to be his successor, and his nephew, Yahya Muhammad Saleh, command the most effective units. Longley Alley says the Gulf Cooperation Council accord ""does not deal effectively with lingering tensions between Saleh's family on one hand and Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar and the powerful al-Ahmar family on the other. Each of these power centers is heavily armed and still poised to fight."" As if to remind the diplomats of the scale of the task ahead, pro- and anti-Saleh factions clashed in Sanaa hours before the ceremony. The challenge of ""securing a cease-fire, removing armed tribesmen from urban centers, returning the military to the barracks and engaging in military-security reform will be serious stumbling blocks post-signing,"" according to Longley Alley. Al-Ahmar makes some Western officials nervous because of his links with radical Sunni Islamists. Yemeni observers say the Muslim Brotherhood has long been influential within al-Ahmar's military command, and he is known for his antipathy toward Yemen's Shiites. A U.S. diplomatic cable from 2005 said that ""Ali Mohsen's questionable dealings with terrorists and extremists would make his accession unwelcome to the U.S. and others in the international community."" Others in this powerful clan include Hamid al-Ahmar, a leader of the Islamist party Islah and a prominent businessman who has long been an opponent of the president. His brother Sadiq also has armed supporters in and around Sanaa. For generations, the Yemeni state has done little without the al-Ahmars' blessing. Sheikh Abdullah Bin Hussein al-Ahmar, who died in 2007, was one of the few Yemenis to command widespread respect -- a man often described as the father of modern Yemen. He was an opposition leader but also speaker of the Parliament, and Saleh was careful not to cross him. Today, there seems no one of similar stature. The tens of thousands of demonstrators who have braved gunfire, tear gas and pro-government gangs in Sanaa, Taiz and elsewhere are unlikely to be satisfied by Saleh's departure. They fear being marginalized by the transfer of power from one clique to another as part of some ""tribal bargain"" and oppose Saleh's immunity from prosecution, which is part of the Riyadh deal. But Longley Alley says they have a role to play. ""The independent youth in Yemen have at times been marginalized by the armed conflict. While these young people do not have guns or butter, they are beginning to organize and to recognize their potential influence."" Others who may play a significant role include the cleric Abdul Majid al-Zindani, who heads the Salafist (very conservative) wing of the Islah party. He is feared by liberal Yemenis. But ultimately, as one U.S. diplomatic cable sent from Sanaa in 2005 put it, ""True power still derives from the military and the tribes."" As for the 69-year old Saleh himself, a combination of factors probably led him to choose this moment to sign away his powers. He still needs medical treatment for the burns sustained in an attack on the Presidential Palace in June -- injuries that left him in a Saudi hospital for three months. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Saleh told him he would be traveling to New York for treatment soon. Another possible reason is that Saleh has seen the violent end of Moammar Gadhafi and growing pressure on Bashar al-Assad in Syria. He also has been subject to intense diplomatic pressure by Saudi Arabia and the United Nations finally to ratify the Gulf Cooperation Council deal. The European Union had begun considering sanctions. And military units loyal to the president have lost ground in recent weeks. But what are his plans now? No one has the definitive answer. The intrigue is reminiscent of the Congress of Vienna in 1815 that drew the post-Napoleonic map of Europe. When the Russian envoy died suddenly, Austria's Prince Metternich is reputed to have said: ""I wonder what his motive was."" Whatever power structure emerges, Yemen's next leaders will face daunting tasks as they inherit a state where oil revenues have declined and the economy is in ruins, where poverty is endemic and a young and rapidly growing population faces a chronic shortage of water. Not to mention the percolating rebellions in the south and north, and a well-entrenched affiliate of al Qaeda. To recall a line from Hamlet that might well apply to Yemen today: . ""When sorrows come, they come not single spies, . ""But in battalions.""","Yemen's future is far from predictable after Saleh's departure, an analyst says .
Armed units from the Saleh family and the al-Ahmar family remain at odds .
The tens of thousands of anti-Saleh demonstrators are likely to play a role .
A combination of factors probably led Saleh to finally step down ."
"(CNN) -- A report from Canadian researchers published Monday says there is not enough sound evidence to support routine screening of children for autism, but several autism experts are questioning the paper's conclusions. The article, published in the journal Pediatrics, is based on a review of existing studies. Currently, the American Academy of Pediatrics -- which publishes the journal -- recommends that doctors screen children for autism during regular checkups at the ages of 18 and 24 months. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 1 in 110 children has some form of autism, a handful of different neuro-developmental disorders that cause mild to severe social, communication and behavioral problems. Monday's report questions whether screening for autism is the right approach. ""Good screening tools and efficacious treatment [for autism] is lacking,"" it says, adding that ""none of the autism screening tests currently available has been shown to be able to fulfill the properties of accuracy."" The report's authors are cerebral palsy experts at McMaster University in Ontario. But several leading autism experts -- who diagnose, treat and study children with autism -- said they were puzzled and concerned by the new report's conclusions. ""By screening for autism at an early age, children are able to begin intervention as soon as possible,"" said Geraldine Dawson, chief science officer for the Autism Speaks advocacy group. ""Studies have shown that early intervention results in significant increases in cognitive and language abilities, and adaptive behavior, and gives children the best chance for a positive outcome."" Dr. Patricia Manning-Courtney, a developmental pediatrician and the director of the autism center at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, said the study goes completely ""against the experience in this field"" in which experts have said early intervention or therapy can yield the most benefits for a child later in life. ""I have never, ever met a family that regretted being told their child may have symptoms -- not a single family,"" she said. If a diagnosis of autism is later found to be inaccurate, the child isn't harmed by the therapy given in the interim, she said. But Manning-Courtney said she's met thousands of parents whose children were diagnosed at an older age ""who wished they were listened to sooner."" Dr. Charles Cowan, medical director of the Seattle Children's Autism Center, echoed Manning-Courtney's concerns, saying the report's conclusions seem to negate well established research and recommendations from people who treat children with autism, including the American Academy of Pediatrics. More research is needed, he said, but just because all the necessary research hasn't been done yet, it ""does not negate the benefit of screening."" Dr. Paul Lipkin, who chaired the academy's 2006 committee that recommended the screenings at 18 and 24 months, said the conclusions in Monday's report overlooked significant benefits to screening. Doctors are also identifying problems beyond autism, including a wide range of developmental disorders, he said. Lipkin, the director of the Center for Development and Learning at the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore, acknowledged that screening tools aren't perfect, but noted that doctors combine them with continuous surveillance. ""We are hoping that the combination can then overcome any of the limits of the tests or surveillance. The combination is better than either one of them,"" he said, adding that some newer studies, not cited in the Canadian study, suggest that ""it does look like we're on the right track."" Despite the apparent criticisms of screening in Monday's article, study author Dr. Jan Willem Gorter said he and his co-authors were not specifically referring to ""the surveillance that is happening in doctors' offices"" at 18 and 24 months. They were recommending against a population-wide screening program that would require screening every child at a certain age level for autism, he said. Nobody is conducting such a study at this time in the United States. Results from a South Korean study of that nature published last month in the American Journal of Psychiatry suggested 1 in 38 children had autism -- a much higher number than previously believed. Some experts questioned the accuracy of those  results, which were based on screening of 55,000 12-year-old children in South Korea, suggesting that the screening may have picked up other developmental delays, not just autism. Last month, the CDC told CNN it was considering a total population study of autism, but no such study is currently underway. Gorter said he and his colleagues did not include the South Korean study in their analysis, but he said it showed ""exactly why we wrote the paper."" He said he and his co-authors based their suggestions on what they learned from children with cerebral palsy, and that his ultimate goal is to ""find the children who truly have autism and find ways to help them."" Screening isn't the only issue touched on in Monday's paper. The article also finds ""little support for the effectiveness for speech and language therapy for people with autism,"" argues that ""applied behavior intervention did not significantly improve the cognitive outcomes of children"" and says that ""screening is pointless, and almost certainly unethical."" Susan Martin, director of media relations for the American Academy of Pediatrics, pointed to the academic journal's disclaimer, which says statements and opinions in the articles it publishes ""are those of the authors and not necessarily those of the AAP."" But several autism specialists said they feared the theoretical questions the article poses would turn back the clock to a time when parents' concerns about their childrens' development weren't heard. Cowan said Monday's report completely leaves out studies that have shown benefits for children in cognitive and social developments. He cites a study published by Dawson and Sally Rogers, which found giving toddlers as young as 18 months old intensive therapy by trained specialists and their parents, can effectively improve the child's IQ, social interaction and ability to communicate. Cowan called that study a ""landmark (clinical) trial"" and said he was surprised the Canadian researchers did not include it. Manning-Courtney, who is also a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said the study could be misinterpreted by some, ""especially insurance companies,"" which may decide they don't have to pay for costly, lengthy autism therapies if a study says that ""efficacious treatments are lacking."" But Gorter said the study's authors want to ""help improve the outcome for the children's lives."" ""I would hope our debate would lead to an action,"" he said.","A new paper says ""good screening tools and efficacious treatment"" for autism are lacking .

"(CNN) -- In 1979, Jarreth Merz, then a young boy in Ghana, saw the dramatic results of a military coup. Watching on an old black and white television set, he and a group of his friends witnessed one of the nation's generals being blindfolded and shot to death by a firing squad. Shortly afterward, his family fled the instability of Ghana and returned to his native Switzerland. But Africa stayed with Merz, who told his story at the TED Global conference in Edinburgh, UK, in July. He grew up to become an actor and found that he was increasingly being cast as a violent African or a terrorist. ""How many terrorists could I possibly play before turning into one myself?"" ""I had become ashamed of the other, the African in me."" After 28 years, Merz returned to Ghana to film the nation's 2008 presidential election and, as it turned out, to learn more about himself. ""I realized that, when I'd left the country, free and fair elections in a democratic environment were a dream. And now that I'd returned, that dream had become reality, though a fragile reality."" In the first round of voting in Ghana, no candidate attained the 50% of the vote needed to gain the presidency, and an inconclusive runoff was held. People began questioning whether the elections were being manipulated. Merz said there was gunfire and he saw discouraging signs of a possible breakdown in civil order. ""And my heart sank, because I thought, here we are again. Here is another proof that the African is not capable of governing himself. And not only that, I am documenting it -- documenting my own cultural shortcomings."" But rather than erupt in violence, the crowd started chanting ""We want peace,"" and eventually, after new voting, a winner was certified and power was transferred peacefully, Merz said. ""Ghana taught me to look at people differently and to look at myself differently. And yes, we Africans can."" In his film, ""An African Election,"" Merz told CNN in an interview, ""The political system, the democratic system, is tested to the utmost."" The lesson: ""You don't have to rebel. You have the freedom to choose, and with that choice comes a responsibility.""","As a boy, Jarreth Merz witnessed violent coup in Ghana .

"(CNN) -- It has been a rough couple of months for Netflix. The company that virtually defined online movie rentals was swamped by an unprecedented wave of customer ire two months ago when it raised prices for both its DVD mailing and online streaming services. Netflix announced this week that it's splitting itself in two and rebranding its movies-by-mail service as ""Qwikster."" Based on initial online responses, this latest effort didn't make things much better. In fact, it seems to have, in the best cases, re-opened old wounds and, in the worst, given customers a whole new set of issues to be angry about. ""Reed, thanks for reminding me that I should go somewhere else for my DVD rentals. It was an insult enough that you raised the price on me last month, right in the middle of the biggest recession since the Great Depression, but now instead of a sincere apology, all we get is excuses and a flimsy new name."" That's from a customer named Jonathan Ortega and it's one of more than 23,000 comments on a blog post by Netflix CEO Reed Hastings explaining the latest changes. In the post, Hastings announced that the service that made Netflix famous, mailing DVDs in those iconic red wrappers, is being spun off and renamed Qwikster, while Web streaming video will continue to be called Netflix. Not all the posts took the same flamethrower approach as Ortega's. But even some of the more evenhanded messages raised questions. ""While I appreciate the explanation (and e-mail) and I guess I understand your reasoning for doing this, the thing I'm having the hard time about is the separation of websites,"" wrote a user named Tellier Killaby Booth. ""I don't understand why I will now have to go to two separate websites to manage my queues. The only reason that I have both services is because half the things I watch aren't available yet on streaming."" Chris Taylor of Mashable (a CNN content partner), questioned whether the spin-off of Qwikster was ""the worst product launch since New Coke."" ""As any marketer will tell you, there are some truly awful times to launch a new product -- like August, when few potential customers are paying attention, or January, when they're all shopped out from the holidays,"" Taylor wrote. ""And then there's launching your new product in the 10th paragraph of an apology for some previous poor communication, as Netflix CEO Reed Hastings did late Sunday with Qwikster. ..."" Taylor, who says he has met and interviewed Hastings several times, calls him ""one of the smartest and most amiable minds I've ever met."" But he lays out a laundry list of problems, from the odd spelling of Qwikster to creating unnecessary confusion for customers who keep both streaming and DVD service. And, yes ... that name. Plenty of folks were chiming in about that name -- from its lack of savvy (who's going to remember how to spell that?) to the fact the Twitter handle is already taken to simply mocking yet another random-seeming, oddly-spelled tech startup title. ""It is as though Hastings and the Netflix crew sat in a room and brainstormed the dumbest possible names they could think of and knew they were really onto something truly stupid when they came up with Qwikster ... ,"" said Huffington Post writer Jason Gilbert in what can only be described as an aggressively snarky post. ""My first reaction, when I heard the news, was, ""Hey Qwikster, 1991 called, it wants its radical new company name back."" The Internet wasn't unanimously down on Netflix's move, however. Venture capitalist Mark Suster, who focuses on early stage tech companies, had a more positive take, calling Hastings' explanation ""simply brilliant."" (Worth noting: His company, GRP Partners, does not list Netflix as one of its investments.) ""[M]any short-termists will think it's a bad idea. Indeed, my Twitter stream tells me so,"" Suster wrote Monday on his blog. ""I find much of the criticism so far fairly reactionary."" He argues that, by splitting off streaming from DVD delivery, Neflix can react more flexibly to the emerging streaming market while maintaining its hold on the mail-delivery market. Keeping them both under one umbrella would have made it harder to respond rapidly to changes in customer demands, he said. According to Netflix, 9.8 million customers currently have the streaming service only, 2.2 million get DVDs only and 12 million get both. That's a loss of roughly 1 million customers since the price increases were announced in July, with 80 percent of the drop coming from DVD-only customers. As DVD customers decline in favor of streaming (and Suster says they inevitably will), Netflix may have to raise prices for DVD delivery, but could keep streaming prices the same under this model, he wrote. ""It's rare in business to see somebody like Reed Hastings tackle the massive changes happening to their businesses and deal with them before they're too late,"" he wrote. ""Imagine if the record labels had been as bold. By making the separation, Reed can now point the Netflix business squarely at the future."" Engadget writer Darren Murph also sees the moves as a potentially astute prediction that the future is in streaming video, not DVD delivery. ""Think of it this way: if Reed's forecasting a future where it no longer makes sense to continue the pursuit of a by-mail DVD business, how would he rather say goodbye?"" he wrote. ""Flushing half of Netflix away and dealing with the backlash? Or quietly shuttering an awkwardly named website no one was particularly enthralled about from the get-go?"" Not that such predictions were doing anything to assuage the customer furor this week. ""This is great news! My dentist just did the same thing. It's so much better,"" a customer named Bryan Thompson wrote on Reed's blog post. ""Now when I have cavities on my top row of teeth I go to one dentist, and when I have cavities on the bottom row, I go to the other dentist across town."" Sanjit Sengupta, a marketing professor at San Francisco State University, understands that response. ""The explanation provided by Hastings in separating the two services into separate business units makes elegant sense to business executives and students but not to all consumers,"" said Sengupta, the co-author of ""Marketing of High-Technology Products and Innovations."" At the end of the day, Sengupta said, it's the pocket-book issue that Netflix is going to have to address above all others. ""I do believe Hastings has got it wrong this time,"" he said. ""And I predict they will have to lower the monthly price of $16 for subscribers who want both DVD by mail and streaming, because the price is not commensurate with value delivered.""","Responses to latest changes announced by Netflix have been mostly negative .
More than 23,000 customers comment on a blog by Netflix CEO about the change .
Under changes, Netflix's DVDs-by-mail service will be re-branded as ""Qwikster""

"(CNN) -- There's an old saying that a lie can go halfway around the world while the truth is putting its boots on -- and in politics, a steady drumbeat of misinformation and mischaracterization can too often shape the national debate. So we wanted to set up a regular online column to confront fear-mongering with the facts, whether it comes from the right or the left during the 2012 campaign. Working with the CNN research team, we'll investigate candidate claims and call bull when necessary. At a time when partisan spin can disproportionately dominate our democracy, this is an attempt to be an independent voice and an honest broker. Tuesday night's CNN national security debate offered plenty of red meat along with principled policy disagreement. But one candidate in particular kept playing fast and loose with the facts: Michele Bachmann. It's part of her usual schtick: playing politics by talk radio rules, where impact is far more important than accuracy. Here's one of my favorite Bachmann howlers from last night: . ""This is one thing we know about Barack Obama. He has essentially handed over our interrogation of terrorists to the ACLU. He's outsourced it to them. Our CIA has no ability to have any form of interrogation for terrorists."" Sounds scary -- and what I love about this particular riff is that it hits so many paranoid-style themes all in one place. There is the image of President Obama as the naÃ¯ve professor, an out-of-touch egghead compromising national security by bringing in card-carrying members of the ACLU to interrogate terrorists. Not only that, he's ""outsourced"" the effort, taking jobs away from our fighting men and women. Finally, there's the bedrock proof point that makes the rhetoric sound real: Our CIA now has no ability to interrogate terrorists. Somewhere, Jack Bauer must be weeping. But what are the facts? The CNN research team has fact-checked such claims from Bachmann before and found that ""The controversial CIA 'black site' prison program, where the suspect of the USS Cole bombing and others were interrogated immediately after arrest, has been dismantled. ... However, the CIA is still interrogating terror suspects in the field in certain cases. For example, CNN reported in July that CIA operatives have secretly traveled to Mogadishu, Somalia, to help interrogate terrorism suspects about terror operations in East Africa and Yemen. ... In a separate incident earlier this year, CNN reported that Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame, a Somali whom the U.S. indicted for providing material support to al Qaeda linked groups, was interrogated for weeks by U.S. authorities on a Navy amphibious assault ship before he was transferred to FBI custody and brought to the United States to make an appearance in federal court this past July."" In other words, Bachmann's claims aren't true. They have more to do with fear-mongering than facts. And of course, her characterization of the Obama administration as pursuing a ""doctrine of appeasement"" flies in the face of Osama bin Laden's corpse and a massive escalation of drone strikes that have killed numerous high-level al Qaeda operatives based on actionable intelligence. This riff is echoed by repeated accusations from presumptive front-runner Mitt Romney that Obama ""apologizes for America."" Again, it's a popular narrative that plays off liberal stereotypes from the late 1960s, but it's not rooted in the reality of this administration. The subject of energy independence also inspired Bachmann to reach for a bridge too far. Here's what she said last night: ""Energy independence is something that President Obama certainly has avoided. ... Almost every decision that the president has made since he came in has been one to put the United States in a position of unilateral disarmament, including the most recent decision he made to cancel the Keystone Pipeline."" Here, Bachmann reflexively reaches for the rhetoric of cold war weakness -- ""unilateral disarmament"" -- saying that he has ""certainly avoided"" any effort at ""energy independence."" But as the failed half-billion-dollar Solyndra investment shows, the administration, for better or worse, has put a lot of capital into creating ""green jobs"" as a way of decreasing our dependence on foreign oil while building a 21st-century energy industry. Beneath all the play-to-the-base rhetoric is this core claim: that Obama made a decision to cancel the Keystone Pipeline. Not quite. Instead, the administration made a play to its own base by delaying any decision on the Keystone pipeline until after the election 2013, pending further review. This made environmental protesters happy, giving them at least a short-term win. But both the pro and con claims over the pipeline in terms of job creation and environmental impact have probably been overstated. And the CNN truth squad had no problem calling Bachmann's Keystone claims ""misleading."" I couldn't help but notice a Politico report that Bachmann received an overheated nod of support (but not an endorsement) from Glenn Beck on his radio show this week. The Pied Piper of the paranoid style said that of all the candidates in the 2012 GOP field, Bachmann ""truly comes the closest to embodying the spirit of Lincoln or Washington."" I can't think of any qualities that those two American icons share with the congresswoman from Minnesota, but I know there's at least one clear contrast: George Washington never told a lie. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","John Avlon: Michele Bachmann distorted the truth at CNN debate .
He says she wrongly said the CIA's interrogations had been outsourced to ACLU .
Her claims that Obama avoid energy independence and killed pipeline are wrong, he says .

"(CNN) -- In his first executive order as Illinois governor, Pat Quinn established Friday the Illinois Reform Commission as an official state body under the governor's office. Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn wants a review of state government practices completed in 100 days. ""I think we are sending a message to the people of Illinois that we understand that integrity is No. 1 when it comes to the government of the Land of Lincoln,"" he said of his executive order. Quinn had set up the commission earlier this year when he was lieutenant governor under Rod Blagojevich, whom lawmakers impeached earlier this month and removed from office Thursday. His executive order ""formally establishes the Illinois Reform Commission under the auspices of the governor's office,"" he said at a news conference. The commission, led by former U.S. Attorney Patrick Collins, is an independent body that aims to evaluate existing Illinois law and practices in government, according to its Web site. It says it will release an initial report outlining its findings and recommendations in about 100 days. Quinn said there is ""an integrity crisis"" in Illinois. ""We're going to start to fumigate state government from top to bottom to make sure that it has no corruption,"" he said.

"BEIRUT, Lebanon (CNN) -- Saad Hariri is poised to follow in his father's footsteps and become Lebanon's next prime minister, a position he said he ""will not shy away from."" Saad Hariri said he will discuss taking the position of Lebanon's prime minister with his allies. ""I will discuss it with my allies,"" the pro-U.S. Sunni lawmaker told CNN. ""You know, I didn't win this election by myself. My allies had a big role to play in winning for the 14th of March (coalition). And I think it will only be fair and obvious that we talk, me and my allies ... and then after that, if I have to do it, I will not shy away from it."" Hariri is the head of the ""March 14"" coalition, which retained its control over Lebanon's government this week despite a strong challenge from a Hezbollah-dominated alliance. Hariri said he hopes to accomplish what his father, former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, never had a chance to do before he was killed in 2005. ""He accomplished in his assassination the sovereignty of Lebanon, the independence of Lebanon,"" Hariri said. ""And I want to accomplish what he always dreamt of Lebanon being. ""I think he would want me to do what's good for Lebanon, do what would unite the Lebanese people, and ... concentrate on the economy and the security and stability of Lebanon."" The elder Hariri was killed in a massive bombing in February 2005 that also left 22 others dead. An ongoing United Nations investigation has found indications of Syrian involvement in the assassination of the popular statesman, but Syria has denied any role. His death triggered massive protests that eventually led to the withdrawal of Syrian forces, ending Syria's occupation of Lebanon. Saad Hariri said Sunday's vote ""was about Lebanon"" and not its precarious position between its alliances with Western countries and its Arab neighbors. ""The people who went on the 7th of June voted for Lebanon first,"" he said. ""It's not about the West; it's not about Iran; it's not about Syria. It's about we as Lebanese, what we want from this new parliament and from this new government that's going to come."" Hariri ruled out an independent peace track with Israel, sticking by his previous assessment that Lebanon will be the last country to sign a peace deal with the Jewish state. ""We will follow after the Arab initiative,"" he said. ""You see, the Arab initiative includes many countries for the peace process, and Lebanon will come as we see fit."" Israel fought a war against Hezbollah militants in Lebanon three years ago that is widely regarded as having empowered the Shiite militia, which claimed victory in the six-week conflict. Some analysts had feared that a Hezbollah victory in this week's parliamentary elections would have heightened tensions in the Middle East, particularly because of the estimated 30,000 rockets pointed at Israel from southern Lebanon, all under the control of Hezbollah militants. Hariri met Tuesday with President Carter, who is in Beirut with more than 200 international observers monitoring the election. Shortly before that meeting, Hariri said the United States will play a key role in the effort to attain peace in the Middle East. ""I think the biggest turning point in this peace process is what the United States will do,"" he said. ""The United States has a big role to play, and if it plays it in the right way, if it plays its role like it should play it, then we will have peace in the region. They should pressure both sides to move forward -- whether the Palestinians and the Israelis, whether the Syrians and the Israelis -- and I'm sure we'll get there."" After the victory of Hariri's coalition, the next step for Lebanese lawmakers will be to elect a speaker of the parliament. Then, Lebanese President Michel Sleiman will ask someone -- presumably Hariri -- to form a government. In Lebanon, the presidency is reserved for Maronite Christians, the speaker of parliament is always a Shia Muslim, and the prime minister is a Sunni Muslim. That system was created to balance power among Lebanon's three main religious groups.","Saad Hariri hopes to finish what his father, Rafik Hariri, never had a chance to do .

"London (CNN) -- Two top international cricket players from Pakistan were found guilty Tuesday of plotting to cheat and to take bribes in a major match against England last summer. Salman Butt and Mohammad Asif could potentially go to prison for up to seven years for the criminal offenses, part of a scandal that rocked the international sport. A third player, Mohammad Amir, pleaded guilty to the same charges. The court barred the press from reporting his plea until the jury reached their verdict on Butt and Asif, for fear of affecting the deliberations. They are due to be sentenced on Wednesday. ""This is a case of cheating, pure and simple,"" Metropolitan Police Detective Chief Superintendent Matthew Horne said in a statement after the verdict. ""The defendants, who are world-class cricketers, sought to cheat to enhance their substantial legitimate earnings."" He said they had ""let down the cricketing world, their fans and the hardworking people that buy tickets to watch."" ""They were role models to countless children around the world and have betrayed their trust,"" the officer said. The Pakistanis were accused of spot fixing, which involves deliberately throwing parts of a game rather than the whole match. Prosecutors accused Butt and Asif of taking part in a betting scam, allegedly arranged by Mazhar Majeed, during a match between Pakistan and England played at the Lord's cricket ground in London. The News of the World, the British tabloid that first reported the allegations, said players deliberately bowled ""no balls,"" or fouls, at specific points in the game and that the alleged ringleader made 150,000 pounds (about $230,000) in the scam. The News of the World has since folded in an unrelated scandal. But Horne praised the newspaper's work, saying it was ""unlikely"" the corruption would have been exposed without ""the good work of investigative journalism; and as an investigator I acknowledge the skill involved in such work."" Prosecutors used audio and video recordings the newspaper made secretly last year involving Majeed, a 36-year-old businessman from London. In one, Majeed is heard telling an unknown contact it is ""not a problem"" to fix the result of a match, adding: ""Boss, you know how many [players] I have got, you know that they do it."" The jury also heard a series of audio and video recordings of conversations and meetings between Majeed and a reporter from the newspaper, who was posing as a rich Indian businessman. One of the recordings showed the reporter handing over $140,000 in a London hotel room that had been fitted with secret cameras. Majeed is heard to give the reporter precise details of events in the match, due to start the following day, that would be rigged by the Pakistani players. Specifically, he describes three no-balls -- illegal deliveries -- that the Pakistani bowlers would concede at particular points in the match. The price of fixing a no-ball, Majeed was heard to say, is $10,000; he went on to tell the undercover reporter that his contact in India made four to five times that amount by betting on no-balls. The jury was then shown extended clips from the Lord's match, during which the Pakistani bowlers did exactly as Majeed had promised. Before one of the no-balls, the cameras even showed Butt, who was captaining the Pakistani team, consult with Amir, the bowler. Earlier in the trial, the jury was told the betting market in the Asian subcontinent is ""breathtaking in size."" Conservative estimates, the prosecution said, puts the value of the market at between $40 billion to $50 billion dollars per year. Alan Peacock, an anti-corruption official at the International Cricket Council, told the court that the betting market had developed over the years from a focus on fixing match results, to spot fixing: contriving small events within the game, like no balls, or particular patterns of scoring. Asif and Butt denied the charges. Majeed was not on trial; the jury was told there is ""nothing sinister"" about this apparent inconsistency. News International, the parent company of the now-defunct News of the World, said Tuesday's guilty verdicts were to the credit of its reporter, Mazher Mahmood, who now works for the Sunday Times. ""The convictions secured today are a clear example of where his professional investigative journalism has served the public interest,"" a spokeswoman said in a statement. The International Cricket Council was happy with the outcome, having earlier suspended the trio for periods between five to seven years. ""We hope that this verdict is seen as a further warning to any individual who might, for whatever reason, be tempted to engage in corrupt activity within our sport,"" the ruling body's chief executive Haroon Lorgat said. ""I am satisfied that we have worked closely with the Crown Prosecution Service and Metropolitan Police throughout this entire process, and I believe that this case has shown that it is possible for criminal authorities and sports bodies to cooperate with each other, in difficult circumstances, in the best interests of the sport and the public at large."" CNN's Andrew Carey and Phil Black contributed to this report.","The outcome is a credit to reporting by News of the World, its parent firm says .

"(CNN) -- A day after Pakistan's ambassador to the United States stepped down, Islamabad named Sherry Rehman as the new U.S. envoy. A graduate of Massachusetts' Smith College, Rehman served as the information minister in 2008 until her resignation the following year. She is also founding chair of the Jinnah Institute, a non-profit public policy organization based in Pakistan. She succeeds former ambassador, Husain Haqqani, who resigned Tuesday amid a probe into a secret offer to Washington by Pakistan's president to cut down the powers of the country's military leadership. On Tuesday, a statement from Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani said Ambassador Husain Haqqani's resignation was necessary ""so that the investigation can be carried out properly."" ""All concerned would be afforded sufficient and fair opportunity to present their views and the investigation shall be carried out fairly, objectively and without bias,"" the prime minister's statement said. Haqqani posted a Twitter message Tuesday saying the he ""requested"" that Gilani accept his resignation. The ambassador offered to resign last week ""or participate in any inquiry that brings an end to the vilification against the democratic government of Pakistan currently being undertaken by some elements in the country."" The controversy started with swirling media reports that President Asif Ali Zardari asked the U.S. government in May to help him hold on to power because he feared a military coup after the U.S. raid on Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. Last month, Pakistani businessman Mansoor Ijaz sparked the political firestorm when he claimed in an op-ed piece for the UK-based Financial Times that a Pakistani diplomat used him to make Zardari's back-channel plea for help by delivering a secret memo to U.S. Admiral Mike Mullen, then Washington's top military official. Ijaz claimed Zardari offered a new ""national security team"" to take over the powers of the military leadership in exchange for Washington's assistance. Media reports in Pakistan have speculated that Haqqani played a key role in the alleged offer. Haqqani has denied the allegations, saying they are part of ongoing ""smear campaigns"" that have accused him of trying to undermine Pakistan's armed forces. ""No memo of the kind being discussed in the media was drafted or delivered by me,"" Haqqani said. ""I have not been named so far as having done anything wrong by anyone except through innuendo.""

"(CNN) -- Former world number one Tiger Woods scored the winning point in the Presidents Cup for the second competition in a row to help the United States retain their trophy against an International team in Melbourne on Sunday. Woods claimed a comfortable four and three success over Australian Aaron Baddeley in their singles match to send the United States past the required 17 1/2 points total needed for victory. Despite enduring a frustrating competition prior to the final day, Woods was able to rediscover some form to replicate the winning point he achieved in San Francisco in 2009. Golfing presidents: Putting for politics . The American side held a healthy four-point lead going into the 12 singles matches, and those were eventually split 6-6 to ensure a 19-15 win for the visiting side -- their seventh success in nine Presidents Cup events so far. Woods told reporters: ""We didn't get off to a good start early on. We needed to get our point so we went out there and played really well -- putting a lot of heat on Badds (Baddeley)."" The success completed a dominant American display over the four days, as they won both foursomes, split a fourball and narrowly lost the second fourballs sessions. On Sunday, Woods' victory was complimented by wins for Hunter Mahan, Nick Watney, Jim Furyk, David Toms and Steve Stricker -- with Furyk the only player to finish unbeaten in his five matches. In response to critics who believe the Americans fail to bond together in golfing team events, Furyk told the official PGA Tour website: ""This stuff about how we aren't close and how we can't come together as a group, it's just not accurate. ""We will win some of these events like the Presidents Cup and the Ryder Cup, and we'll lose some. But whatever we do, we'll always do it as a team."" He continued: ""Since I've started playing in these, I've always loved them. But so do all the guys. They all care. Look at Tiger and Phil (Mickelson) in his room. Do they look like they don't care about what we just accomplished?""","United States retain the Presidents Cup after beating Internationals 19-15 in Melbourne .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- At least five people were killed in Yemen when pro-government gunmen shot at anti-government protesters in the capital, medics in Sanaa's Change Square told CNN Thursday. The violence came a day after President Ali Abdullah Saleh agreed to step down from power after months of protests against his 33-year rule. He became the fourth leader to leave office as a result of the Arab Spring unrest that has roiled much of the Middle East and North Africa this year. Protests against the Yemeni government Thursday were bigger than some expected given Saleh's agreement to transfer power, with youth saying their demands have not yet been met. At least 41 people were injured, including 27 from gunshot wounds and the others from baton beatings, medics said. Three of the wounded are currently in critical condition. A senior Interior Ministry official denied that the government was responsible for the attacks. ""The protesters were attacked but they were not attacked by government forces. We will investigate this,"" said the official, who asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media. The official conceded that many people were ""angry that Saleh signed the power transfer proposal."" ""Such attacks were expected, though we tried to prevent them,"" said the official. ""The opposition is trying to damage (the) reputation of the current government. Anything that happens is always blamed against the ruling family without them even investigating the case."" Heavy gunfire continued for more than 30 minutes on Zubairy Street, when youth marched to condemn the immunity given to Saleh. They vowed to continue their revolution until Saleh is tried for his crimes. ""He is the reason for the deaths of more than a thousand innocent youth in Yemen this year and now the opposition wants to give him immunity,"" said Mohammed Mosleh, a youth activist who participated in Thursday's march. ""The government planned today's attacks,"" he charged. ""We will not stay quiet..."" He said the opposition does not represent all Yemenis and should not have agreed to give Saleh immunity. Protesters in Sanaa said they saw the gunmen escape the scene of the attack using government security vehicles. Protests continued, meanwhile, in 15 provinces throughout the country. Government forces also attacked protesters in Taiz province Thursday, eyewitnesses said, injuring three as they were marching calling for Saleh to face justice in the International Criminal Court.
