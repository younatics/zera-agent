"(CNN) -- South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford told the woman with whom he was having an affair they were ""in a hopelessly impossible situation of love"" last year when he was thought to be under consideration for the Republican vice presidential nomination, according to e-mails obtained by The State newspaper. Gov. Mark Sanford speaks during a news conference at the State Capitol in Columbia on Wednesday. The Columbia-based newspaper, which acquired the e-mails in December, told CNN that the governor's office had confirmed their authenticity on Wednesday. When contacted by CNN, a spokesman for the governor would neither confirm nor deny the authenticity of the e-mails. The e-mails between the GOP governor and a Buenos Aires, Argentina, resident named ""Maria,"" were exchanged in July of last year, according to the newspaper. In one July 10 message, Sanford told the woman about his plans to take a family vacation and meet with then-Republican presidential candidate John McCain who ""has kicked up the whole VP talk all over again in the press back home ..."" before he veered into more emotional territory. ""You have a particular grace and calm that I adore. You have a level of sophistication that so fitting with your beauty,"" Sanford wrote, according to the e-mails published on the newspaper's Web site.  Watch CNN.com's political team discuss the situation » . ""I could digress and say that you have the ability to give magnificent gentle kisses, or that I love your tan lines or that I love the curve of your hips, the erotic beauty of you holding yourself (or two magnificent parts of yourself) in the faded glow of the night's light -- but hey, that would be going into sexual details ..."" ""...while all the things above are all too true -- at the same time we are in a ... hopelessly impossible situation of love...."" he added. ""How in the world this lightening strike snuck up on us I am still not quite sure. As I have said to you before I certainly had a special feeling about you from the first time we met, but these feelings were contained and I genuinely enjoyed our special friendship and the comparing of all too many personal notes ..."" Earlier, ""Maria"" -- whose full name has not yet been released -- also proclaimed her devotion in a July 9 e-mail. ""You are my love ... something hard to believe even for myself as it's also a kind of impossible love, not only because of distance but situation,"" she wrote. ""Sometimes you don't choose things, they just happen ... I can't redirect my feelings and I am very happy with mine towards you."" John O'Connor, the newspaper reporter who wrote the story about the e-mails, told CNN Wednesday afternoon that The State did not confront Sanford with the messages in December because at the time ""there was little way to tell that these were authentic e-mails.""  Watch Gov. Sanford's conference Wednesday » . O'Connor said that given the recent events surrounding Sanford, the paper then decided to approach the governor's office with the e-mails. Sanford, who had been considered a potential candidate for the 2012 presidential campaign, admitted the affair Wednesday. The affair began in the last year and was discovered five months ago, Sanford told reporters without elaborating. He added he and his wife were trying to work through it. The governor had not been seen in public since June 18. When questioned, Sanford's staff had told media outlets that he was hiking in the Appalachian Trail. But Sanford was spotted Wednesday in Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport.

"(CNN) -- Sure, the wedding was stunning. The doves were released on cue, you didn't stumble on your vows, and your aunt Caroline stayed sober until after the toasts. But something was off: Your special day didn't play as well on social media as you were hoping. Where were all the RTs for that hilarious bouquet-catching Vine? Why didn't anyone Instagram the handmade Mason-jar floral arrangements in the restrooms? And only 10 likes for the first blurry picture of the new couple? Please. The W hotel chain is here to help. For a mere $3,000, couples getting hitched at any of the four W hotels in New York can hire their very own ""social media wedding concierge"" to make sure every moment of their special day is properly immortalized in tweets, Instagrams and Facebook posts. This concierge will be involved with the wedding from the very beginning, acting as an amateur Instagram-ographer, documenting bits of the planning process such as cake tasting and dress shopping. He or she will even help create inspirational Pinterest boards. On the wedding day, the concierge will live-tweet and Instagram the entire affair. They'll make sure your guests all use the same hashtag while posting from their phones during the ceremony and reception. (Is there anything more embarrassing than sloppy cousins using #ashleyandbrock instead of #ashleyandbrockforever?) When it's over, the hotel will compile the best posts into a book. ""If you want to build a social media footprint of your big day (and this is something people aim to do; we've even had people ask us how they can get their wedding to 'trend'!), That's where we come in,"" said Alyssa Kiefer, W's head of global social media. Kiefer says the W is responding to increasing interest among guests who want to integrate social media into their weddings. The hotel has even seen couples updating their Facebook statuses at the altar. Wedding photos: When snap-happy guests go too far . The idea of paying a ""concierge"" $3,000 to live-tweet your wedding was widely mocked Wednesday on Twitter. But like every other major life event, including new jobs, new babies and envy-inducing vacations, weddings are increasingly playing out on social media. If it wasn't shared publicly, did it really happen? In fairness, there are some practical reasons couples might want to share every detail of a wedding online. Perhaps an aging grandmother or far-away relatives can't make the trip but would like to follow along. (And if your aging grandmother is on Twitter, more power to her.) On the other hand, some brides and grooms may see their wedding less as an opportunity to make a lifelong commitment in front of loved ones and more as a savvy way to grab attention. If you can afford it, a lavish wedding is a great way to fit in a bit of shameless self-promotion. A social ""concierge"" is the opposite of another recent trend sweeping weddings: asking guests to unplug completely. Some wedding photographers, irked by having to jostle with snapshot-seeking guests, have pushed for phone-free ceremonies. ""In theory, one would hope it would be a service that seamlessly could fit into a wedding, but I worry it could very easily become a distraction and hindrance to all involved,"" wedding photographer Corey Ann said. Ann has seen a lot of younger wedding guests embracing dedicated hashtags. But she fears that could leave out older family members and guests who aren't updating social media accounts. The W hotel will also help couples hoping to unplug on their wedding day, if that's their preference. The planners can collect phones from guests as they arrive. ""To some, this may seem a bit over the top, and we're OK with that,"" Kiefer said. ""We're sure couples balked at the idea of traditional wedding planners years ago, and now you wouldn't think of planning a wedding without one.""","For $3,000, couples getting married at W hotels can hire a ""social media concierge""

"(CNN) -- Another chartered flight is scheduled to leave the United States for Cuba Sunday as a result of recent U.S. government moves to ease restrictions on travel to the Communist nation. In a partnership with Delta Air Lines, Marazul, a Miami-based travel agency that specializes in travel to Cuba, has restored direct flights between select U.S. airports and Havana, Cuba, a Delta spokeswoman said Sunday. ""We are excited to get back into the market in partnership with Marazul,"" Delta spokeswoman Gina Laughlin said, adding that some flights took place in October, departing from Miami. Marazul announced on its website that it has restored its direct flight between New York City's John F. Kennedy International Airport and Havana, scheduled to take off on Sunday. In December, Marazul will provide weekly flights from Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, Marazul announced. Round-trip tickets can only be purchased through Marazul travel, which has chartered a Boeing 737 with crews from Delta Air Lines for its Miami-Havana flight, the travel company said. Laughlin said loosened government restrictions on travel to Cuba has allowed Delta to re-establish the charter service with Marazul. According the Marazul's website, these flights are offered only to passengers who have been ""duly authorized"" by the U.S. government to travel to Cuba. This includes, but is not restricted to, travelers with close relatives in Cuba, official business travelers, professionals, students and other potential travelers authorized by the U.S Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). In September of 2009, OFAC announced it would ease existing restrictions on travel to Cuba, citing President Barack Obama's initiative announced the same year to ""reach out to the Cuban people in support of their desire to freely determine their country.""","Delta Air Lines partners with Marazul travel agency to provide chartered flights to Cuba .

"(CNN) -- At least seven U.N. peacekeepers were killed and 17 others were injured in an ambush Saturday morning near their base in Manawashi, north of the South Darfur regional capital of Nyala, a U.N. spokesman said. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed outrage about the attacks and identified the killed peacekeepers as Tanzanians, a spokesman said. A group of vehicles manned by troops and police of the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) was attacked. It was the third attack on the unit in three weeks, the spokesman said. The secretary-general ""expects that the Government of Sudan will take swift action to bring the perpetrators to justice,"" the spokesman's statement said. The Darfur region is located in Sudan along the border with the new nation of South Sudan. The convoy came under heavy gunfire, and fighting continued as peacekeepers were vastly outnumbered, said Chris Cycmanick, acting spokesman for the U.N. Mission in Darfur. There has not been any claim of responsibility for the attack. Violence has plagued Darfur for a decade. The United Nations estimates as many as 300,000 people have been killed and almost 3 million people have been displaced from their homes since the Darfur conflict broke out in 2003. Widespread atrocities have occurred during fighting between Sudan's government forces and militias and other rebel groups. The African Union-U.N. Hybrid Operation was established as peacekeepers in 2007, with the mission's headquarters in El Fasher, North Darfur.","The seven killed U.N. peacekeepers are Tanzanians .

"(CNN) -- We don't yet know what polluted swamp of mental sickness led Ismaaiyl Brinsley to embark on a multistate rampage that culminated with the barbaric, execution-style killing of NYPD Officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos on a New York City street. But the madman's actions could not have happened at a worse time for a city already embroiled in a bitter public battle over police-community relations. It's very possible that an important debate about race, policing and the proper use of force will be buried along with the martyred officers. Weeks of street protests over a grand jury's decision not to indict police officers who killed Eric Garner -- along with Mayor Bill de Blasio's statements in sympathy with the goals of the demonstrators -- had already antagonized police unions (which, to make matters even more fraught, are in the middle of trying to settle a contract with the city). Even before the slaying of the officers, a war of words between de Blasio and union leaders had grown strikingly bitter, prompting New York's most prominent cleric, Cardinal Timothy Dolan, to publicly call on both sides to ratchet down the rhetoric. The call for civility hadn't yielded much in the way of results -- the unions continued to bash the mayor, and a street demonstration earlier this month for the first time turned violent, with a pair of police officers beaten on the Brooklyn Bridge. ""It's not a time for political analysis,"" said a somber de Blasio at a press conference Saturday, shortly after meeting with the families of the slain officers. The mayor appeared shaken, in part because while entering the hospital where the dead officers' bodies lay, he passed through a cordon of dozens of officers who pointedly turned their backs on him instead of saluting. De Blasio's call for a temporary halt to political warfare didn't stop his adversaries from going on the attack. Typical of the criticism was a Twitter message from former Gov. George Pataki, a Republican who has been floating trial balloons about a possible run for president.  Pataki pronounced himself ""sickened by these barbaric acts, which sadly are a predictable outcome of divisive anti-cop rhetoric of Eric Holder and Mayor de Blasio."" The statement is farfetched to say the least: Neither Pataki nor anybody outside the psychiatric profession has the slightest idea why Brinsley shot his girlfriend, traveled hundreds of miles to New York, randomly killed two policemen and then took his own life. Boldly claiming that the mayor and attorney general led Brinsley to murder by mere words raises a question Pataki can't possibly answer: Which speeches, exactly, made it all happen? An even harsher tone came from police union leaders. ""There is blood on many hands tonight,"" said the president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, Patrick Lynch. ""Those that incited violence on the street in the guise of protest, that tried to tear down what New York City police officers did every day. We tried to warn it must not go on, it shouldn't be tolerated. That blood on the hands starts on the steps of City Hall, in the office of the mayor."" Watching the turmoil on television, you'd never know that New York is on track to register the lowest number of murder and other serious crimes since the city began tracking numbers in the 1960s. The city has never been safer -- but rarely has it seemed so divided and angry. Both sides are guilty of excess and poor judgment. ""Lynch's fulminations about legitimate policy differences have been destructively overheated,"" the New York Daily News said in a recent editorial, condemning the union president for circulating a form officers can complete that asks de Blasio not to attend their funerals if they end up killed in the line of duty. The mayor, who has openly supported the sentiment of demonstrators protesting the police killing of Garner, made mistakes of his own. De Blasio should have issued a harsh rebuke to activists who recently marched through the streets chanting ""Shoot Back!"" and ""What do we want? Dead cops!"" The mayor should have agreed to Lynch's demand that protest leaders loudly and publicly disavow such violent rhetoric. Can things get worse? Yes, they can. In 1992, cops upset at then-Mayor David Dinkins staged a rally at City Hall that turned into a near riot, with 10,000 officers taking over a bridge, tramping on cars, and booing and cursing at superior officers and elected officials. We haven't reached that point in New York -- yet. But these are dark, troubled times in an urban center where 20 years of dedicated effort by police and community have mostly conquered the true, common enemy -- the city's criminals, who are surely enjoying the discord that allows them to thrive in our divided city.","Errol Louis: Killing of two NYPD officers could not have come at a worse time for the city .

"(CNN) -- Shirley Temple Black, who rose to fame as arguably the most popular child star in Hollywood history, died late Monday night, her publicist said. She was 85. Temple Black, who also enjoyed a long career as a diplomat, died of natural causes at her Woodside, California, home. She was surrounded by family and caregivers, a statement from Cheryl Kagan said. She began acting at age 3 and became a massive box-office draw before turning 10, commanding a then-unheard of salary of $50,000 per movie. Her first film of notice was in 1932 when she played in ""War Babies,"" part of the ""Baby Burlesks"" series of short films. Appreciation: Shirley Temple, the model child star . For about 18 years, she sang, tap-danced and acted her way into the hearts of millions. Her corkscrew curls were popular with little girls from the 1930s through the 1970s. Early years . Her star shone brightest as a toddler, and 20th Century Fox cranked out a series of feature films with the adorable, talented little girl. Her hits included ""Little Miss Marker"" (1934), ""Curly Top"" (1935) and ""The Littlest Rebel"" (1935). At the box office, she beat out the great adult stars of her day, such as Clark Gable and Bing Crosby. Her popularity spawned a large array of merchandizing items, such as dolls, hats and dresses. She was the top box-office star four years in a row, from 1935 to 1938. Her career was at its peak as the country was suffering the effects of the Great Depression, and her films offered uplifting moments. But as she got older, the pace of movies slowed, and by 1939, her popularity was fading. She and 20th Century Fox terminated her contract early in 1940, just before she reached her teenage years. Share your memories of Shirley Temple Black . U.S. diplomat . She retired from filmmaking at 22 and married Charles Black, changing her last name from Temple to Temple Black. But she did not fade from the public eye.

Former U.S. President George H.W. Bush, who appointed her to the Czechoslovakia post, said Tuesday that he and his wife ""mourn the loss of an American icon."" ""She captured the affections of millions around the world by her endearing performances on the silver screen as a young girl, but I also admired Shirley for her selfless service to our country later in her life,"" Bush said in a statement released by his spokesman. ""In both roles, she truly lifted people up and earned not only a place in our hearts -- but also our enduring respect. ""Barbara and I send our condolences to Shirley's family and countless fans around the world."" A statement from Temple Black's family members said they ""salute her for a life of remarkable achievements as an actor, as a diplomat, and most importantly as our beloved mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, and adored wife of fifty-five years of the late and much missed Charles Alden Black.""

"(CNN) -- A New York judge on Thursday postponed a ruling on whether a former judge's self-professed racial bias led him to wrongly convict a man of murder nearly 15 years ago. The case is being revisited because former New York Supreme Court Judge Frank Barbaro, a longtime champion of civil rights, has since said he believes he denied a fair trial to a white man who claimed he killed a black man in self-defense. Barbaro now says that in the years after he convicted and sentenced Donald Kagan, his decision began ""haunting"" him. Testifying during a hearing in December on a motion to set aside the conviction, the former judge said he was convinced at the time that the defendant who stood before him was a racist who wanted to kill a black person. As a result, Barbaro now says, he ignored evidence that Kagan had acted out of fear and not hatred. New York City Criminal Court Judge ShawnDya L. Simpson on Thursday continued the case until September 22. Simpson, who presided at the December hearing, already had postponed making a ruling in the case twice this year. Defendant said he was armed out of fear . In a bench trial in October 1999, Kagan said he was acting in self-defense when he shot Wavell Wint, 23, during a confrontation at a Brooklyn movie theater 11 months before. Barbaro, who is white, didn't believe Kagan. The judge found him guilty of second-degree murder and criminal possession of a weapon. Kagan was sentenced to 15 years to life in prison, where he remains today. Barbaro, now 86, said in an exclusive interview with CNN earlier this year, ""I couldn't get out of my mind the look on the lawyer's face when I said I found him guilty. And the defendant on the stand, like he was pleading to me, 'It just happened, it just happened,' and that was sort of haunting me."" Kagan testified during the two-day trial in 1999 that he had been afraid of Wint, who was black. He said he came to the theater armed because the neighborhood had a reputation of being unsafe. Wint, according to the trial record, had been confrontational with a number of people that night before the encounter with Kagan. Wint was not armed. When their paths eventually crossed, words were exchanged and they scuffled. Wint was shot and killed, and Kagan was charged with murder. Barbaro landed the bench trial. Barbaro said it may have been his own reputation for fairness that persuaded Kagan to put his fate in the judge's hands and not a jury's. Barbaro: 'I think I made a mistake' In his opinion, Barbaro wrote, ""The circumstantial evidence convinces the court that when [Kagan], in response to [Wint's] verbal taunts, pulled out his gun for the second and last time, he fully intended to kill [Wint].'' He said later that he did not give much weight to the self-defense argument presented by Kagan's attorney. Barbaro always had his pulse on the cause of civil rights. He stuck up for the underdog in his personal life and professionally, as a lawyer and former state legislator, before becoming a judge. Was he so influenced by his civil rights passions that he had assumed the only reason Kagan shot Wint was because Wint was black? Had he given Kagan a fair trial? Patti Barbaro, the judge's wife, told CNN earlier this year, ""He said, 'I really feel I need to revisit this case. I need to get the transcripts. I don't feel comfortable with this. It's been haunting me.'"" Finally, in 2011, Barbaro called Kagan's defense attorney Jeff Adler and made an amazing admission: . ""I think I made a mistake,"" he told him. He asked the attorney to send him the transcript of the trial. Very unusual motion for reversal . After reading his own trial record, Barbaro came to the conclusion that in his quest for equality between the races, he completely ignored the trial evidence that had to do with Kagan's claim of self-defense. He realized he really hadn't considered whether Kagan felt an imminent fear for his life during the confrontation. That began the process of a lengthy new legal battle, with the defense filing a motion to set aside Barbaro's murder verdict based on one of the most unusual claims the courts would ever hear: The trial judge was admitting he had not given the defendant a fair trial. The judge -- who by then had retired and no longer had jurisdiction in the case -- became, in effect, a witness for the defense of the man he had convicted years earlier. Texas ex-prosecutor denies wrongdoing in Willingham death penalty case . Wint's family: 'It's not fair' Barbaro testified at the December 2013 hearing and was cross-examined by the prosecution, who questioned the judge's memory of events in an effort to discount his admission of racial bias. The family of Wavell Wint, including his now-grown son, attended that hearing, too. They were angry that the justice they felt they received with the verdict so many years ago could possibly be taken away. One month later, Wint's family returned to court to hear arguments on the issue by both sides. In an impassioned plea, the prosecution told the court the conviction should stand, that 14 years ago Judge Frank Barbaro thoughtfully issued a very well-reasoned opinion. They said even if his personal beliefs colored his perception of the case, that was not grounds to overturn the verdict. ""It's not fair,"" said Carmen De Jesus, who was Wint's girlfriend and the mother of his child. ""My son grew up without a father, it's not fair. [Kagan] pulled out the gun and he murdered that man."" Wint's family told CNN. After testifying last year, Barbaro said, ""It wasn't difficult to come forward. It is painful to know I sent an innocent man to jail."" Kagan, now 39, becomes eligible for parole in November. How much is a wrongful conviction worth?

"(CNN) -- Great evil often brings out the best in good men, men like Todd Beamer on Flight 93, Medal of Honor recipient Michael Murphy in Afghanistan and now the Aurora three -- the three young men, each in different parts of theater nine, who gave their lives to protect their girlfriends. Twenty-five-year-old Jon Blunk was sitting next to his girlfriend, Jansen Young, at the midnight premiere of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" when the gunman (who shall remain nameless) opened fire in the dark theater. Blunk instinctively pushed his girlfriend to the ground and threw his body on top of hers. Blunk, a security guard, served five years in the Navy and was in the process of re-enlisting in hopes of becoming a Navy SEAL, family and friends said. He was killed in the gunfire; his girlfriend survived. Twenty-four-year-old Alex Teves dived on top of his girlfriend, Amanda Lindgren, when the gunfire erupted. Covering her body, he took the bullets so they did not harm her. She survived the massacre; he did not. Matt McQuinn, 27 years old, threw his body in front of his girlfriend, Samantha Yowler, as the shooting continued. Yowler survived with a gunshot wound to the knee; McQuinn's body absorbed the fatal shots. These men were three of the 12 innocent people killed early that morning. Their incredible sacrifice leaves us asking: Why? Why would a young man with his entire life ahead of him risk everything for a woman he has no legal, financial or marital obligations to? Opinion: Looking into the minds of killers . As Hanna Rosin so eloquently pointed out in a recent article, calling it chivalry would be a tremendous understatement. By all appearances, these men believed that a man has a responsibility to protect a woman, even to the point of death. They believed that there are things in life worth dying for and the innocent woman sitting next to them was one. They believed, to put it simply, in a code of honor. They put the lives of the women before their own, an old fashioned notion to be sure, but certainly an honorable one (if you have any doubt, ask the survivors). Their instincts were to protect, not run away. Remembering the Colorado shooting victims . From all accounts, these young men were average, working men in their 20s. (We know a little about Jon Blunk, but not much, and we know even less about the others.) Like all men, they had their own struggles. After his death we learned that Blunk had an ex-wife and two children living in Nevada. He was scheduled to visit them to resolve marital issues. This isn't to take anything away from Blunk or the other two heroes, but to illustrate that, in spite of shortcomings, men can still recognize what it means to be a good man and act like one. Frum: Fear drives gun debate . This is especially important given the state of many men today. Record numbers of men aren't working or even looking for work. Record numbers aren't marrying or even acting as fathers to their children. These men need heroes to imitate whom they can relate to in everyday life, not just make-believe superheroes who catch their imagination for an hour or two. They need heroes like the Aurora three. While much of the media obsesses over the psychology and motivations of this deranged killer, we should hold the Aurora three high. It is only by telling their story that this code of honor will survive for future generations of men. ""The world is forwarded by having its attention fixed on the best things,"" Matthew Arnold wrote. In an age when traditional manhood has been increasingly relegated to fiction -- capes, masks and green screens -- these three men stand as real-life heroes. Their actions remind us that good triumphs over evil, not just in movies, but also in reality. How to help the victims . Are you a friend or family member of one of the victims?

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Two California men were sentenced to prison Thursday for their roles in the severe beating of a San Francisco Giants fan after a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2011. Marvin Norwood, 33, and Louie Sanchez, 31, were sentenced to four years and eight years, respectively. Members of victim Bryan Stow's family appeared in court and made statements to the defendants and the judge during the sentencing. Now brain-damaged as a result of the beating, Stow is disabled and unable to care for himself, said his father, David. ""The time you serve will be insignificant to what Bryan must endure. However, the years you spend in prison is what you two cretins deserve,"" David Stow said to the two men. Norwood, however, was scheduled to be released with credit for time served; he had been in jail in the case for more than two years. Federal authorities plan to take Norwood into custody, if released by local authorities, because Norwood faces a federal charge of a being a felon in possession of firearms, said spokesman Thom Mrozek with the U.S. Attorney's office in Los Angeles. Earlier in the day, Norwood pleaded guilty to felony assault by means likely to produce great bodily injury. Sanchez pleaded guilty to felony mayhem. In exchange for their guilty pleas, other felony charges were dropped against the defendants. Both men are from Rialto, California. The Dodgers issued a statement saying ""we are pleased that the culpable parties have finally accepted responsibility for their actions and have been sentenced for their crimes."" The baseball team declined to comment further because the Stow family is suing the organization in connection with the beating and the stadium's security. Prosecutors say the men attacked Stow, now 45, in the Dodgers' stadium parking lot after the Opening Day game on March 31, 2011. The paramedic from Santa Cruz went into a coma as a result of the beating and, after returning to consciousness, is still struggling with a severe brain injury. The men, who appeared in court in handcuffs, were harshly criticized by Judge George Lomeli. ""Mr. Stow will be forever trapped in the medical condition"" that the men put him in, he said during the sentencing. ""I have to comment on the attack, which was absolutely brutal. ""You blindsided Mr. Stow,"" the judge said. ""You are a complete coward."" Sanchez smirked during the judge's admonishment. ""You show no remorse whatsoever,"" Lomeli added. ""At the end of the day, it was only a game. ... And you lost perspective."" A statement from the district attorney's office said Sanchez attacked Stow from behind in ""an unprovoked attack"" and witnesses testified that Norwood prevented Stow's friends from helping him. Caregivers and family members shower, dress and feed Stow, who takes 13 medications a day, said sister Bonnie Stow. ""No sentencing you receive will be long enough,"" she told the defendants. ""Your lack of regret makes me despise you even more."" Another sister, Erin Collins, said the damage to her brother's brain was catastrophic. A shunt now protrudes on the right side of his skull, and its left side is slightly sunken. His skull has deep scars. ""Because of your actions, Bryan can't go to the bathroom by himself,"" Collins said. ""He has to wear adult diapers. I hate having to say that out loud, but it shows the severity of what you did. ""Being here, I hope to see one tiny bit of remorse in order to not think you are both that despicable, but I don't. How can we begin to consider forgiveness when you aren't even asking for it,"" Collins said. Collins also read aloud in court a statement written by Stow's wife that was directed to the defendants: . ""Our son Tyler's first word was ball. His next word was daddy. And when they started playing catch, Bryan promised to play catch with him every day, and he did until you took that away from him. Our daughter, Tabitha, loved to ride bikes with her daddy and he did that every day he could, again, until you both took that away. ""Based on your actions, it is completely obvious that you have no respect for human life.""

"(CNN) -- Miley Cyrus came to Mexico ""like a wrecking ball"" -- to quote her hit song -- offending fans at Monterrey concert and prompting a federal investigation. This happened Tuesday in Monterrey, during the first of four scheduled ""Bangerz Tour 2014"" gigs in Mexico: . As Cyrus was ""twerking"" in the middle of a song, one of the two dancers contorting beside her used a Mexican flag to spank the oversized, false buttocks she was wearing. Adding insult to injury: Tuesday was Mexico's Independence Day. Mexican law is very stern on the subject of respecting the flag, the Mexican seal and national anthem: Any action ""that implies contempt or lack of respect to the Homeland Symbols will be punished according to its severity and the condition of the offender."" The act of disrespecting a Mexican symbol carries a fine up to about $1,200 and three days in jail, and that's if it doesn't happen during the commission of a felony. There's been no word about putting the international pop star in the slammer, but lawmakers in Nuevo Leon state voted unanimously Wednesday to condemn the incident. Speaking to CNN, state Rep. Francisco Treviño said the Mexican Interior Ministry has opened an investigation at the request of the state legislature. ""I felt truly offended and annoyed by the fact that a foreign artist feels like she can come here and make fun of and mock our national flag on Independence Day, September 16th. She brazenly made fun of our flag,"" Treviño said. Regardless of where the investigation goes, Treviño says, it seems the 21-year-old Cyrus and her concert organizers have gotten the message. ""It's important to notice that in her second concert Wednesday (also in Monterrey) she didn't desecrate the flag. There were several flags on display at the concert venue, but their use was appropriate. I hope this incident serves to get the message out that we Mexicans don't like it when our flag is made fun of,"" Treviño said. It's not the first time the singer has been at odds with officials in Latin America. Regulators of public events in the Dominican Republic canceled her concert scheduled for September 13 in Santo Domingo on morality grounds. Cyrus is scheduled to perform in Mexico City on Friday and Guadalajara on Sunday before ""Bangerz"" moves on to Chile and Argentina.

"United Nations (CNN) -- Nearly 150,000 refugees from Sri Lanka's civil war remain detained in Sri Lankan government internment camps, according to the United Nations' chief humanitarian affairs official, John Holmes. Briefing the media Monday at U.N. headquarters in New York, Holmes said that the Sri Lankan government showed ""good progress in some important areas"" but said there are ""plenty of problems still to resolve."" Holmes is freshly returned from a three-day trip to Sri Lanka where he met with government officials and war refugees to reassess that government's efforts towards resettling the estimated 280,000 civilians that have been held in internment camps there since the final stages of Sri Lanka's civil war. The Sri Lankan government had previously promised to release all of its internally displaced people (IDPs) from the camps within a 180-day window after the end of the war in May, but missed its deadline earlier this month. It has now set a deadline of January 2010 for full resettlement. Holmes reported that despite a late start, the release of IDPs from the camps is now occurring at a faster pace. ""If people can move freely in and out of camps, then the question of the speed of return becomes a little bit less critical,"" he explained, noting that some refugees are now able to sign themselves in and out of the camps for a few days at a time, if not permanently. The refugee families allowed to return home have been promised relief packages including tin sheets for roofing from the Indian government and at least 25,000 rupees (US $218.30) from the United Nations' refugee agency. Holmes anticipated that ""those needs will continue for at least six months,"" adding that humanitarian organizations on the ground in Sri Lanka believe a residual caseload of 20,000 to 30,000 refugees will remain homeless in January. Holmes also expressed concern over the quality of the Sri Lankan government's recent actions on the camps. ""We would have wanted more consultation with the IDPs themselves; that's in accordance with the guiding principles for how the internally displaced should be treated,"" Holmes explained. He said that many of those released from the camps were returning to villages where their homes and possessions had been destroyed by acts of war and where sluggish efforts to remove landmines meant that paths were left perilous. ""But on other hand there is no disputing the general willingness of people to return and to endure what they have to endure in order to reestablish themselves,"" he added. Since October 2008, the Sri Lankan government has used internment camps to detain nearly 300,000 civilians during its civil war against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. While the Sri Lankan government justified its use of the camps as a way to protect civilians from landmines and Tamil separatists, its continued use of the camps after the end of the war in May have led some to accuse Sri Lanka of violating international humanitarian rights law. ""What we need to keep focusing on is accountability for violations for international human rights law for both sides during the conflict,"" Holmes advised. ""We're also very keen to encourage the process of political reconciliation, which is fundamental to make sure the opportunity posed by the end of the war is not missed.""","Returning refugee families are promised relief packages and $218 .

"(CNN) -- At the start of the 1980s there were more than a million elephants in Africa. During that decade, 600,000 were destroyed for ivory products. Today perhaps no more than 400,000 remain across the continent, according to Samuel Wasser of the University of Washington, who is widely recognized as an authority on the subject. It is a tragedy beyond reckoning and humanity needs to pay attention to the plight of the elephants before it is too late. In the past few years an epic surge in poaching has resumed the killing, thanks to the penchant for ivory in the Asian market -- especially in China, where ivory is now selling for over $1500 a kilo. Recently, Julius Kipng'etich, the head of the Kenya Wildlife Service, made a plea at the Library of Congress in Washington in an unprecedented appeal for the world to save Kenya's and Africa's elephants from the plague of poaching that has in recent years seen the decimation of tens of thousands of them. Interactive: Top 10 conservation hits and misses . It is an appeal that follows from Kenya's determination to torch about 10 tons of ivory last July near Tsavo National Park in a show of disdain for the destroyers of elephants and disgust at the resumption of poaching. If this level of killing continues, if elephants continue to be slaughtered for trinkets and statuettes, in 10 years' time most of Africa's elephants will be gone and an ineffable symbol of majesty and wonder -- and the linchpin in the ecology of an entire continent -- will have been consigned to oblivion. A recent Senate hearing in Washington called ""Ivory and Insecurity -- The Global Implications of Poaching in Africa."" underscores the significance of this issue. Iain Douglas-Hamilton, founder of Save the Elephants, John Scanlon, the secretary general of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), and Sen. John Kerry underscored not only the implications of elephant and wildlife poaching, but also the criminal syndicates who make billions on the illegal wildlife trade, as well as its impact on local populations in Africa, global security and even terrorism. An urgent and concerted international will is needed to fund law enforcement to protect what remains of the elephant population of the world. Read more: Kenya finds illegal ivory in boxes disguised as diplomatic baggage . Growth in human population is a major concern. Millennia-old elephant migration paths have been disrupted. Climate change is a menace to the elephant and all life. But the wanton shooting of the innocents to satisfy vanity has reached a level of madness no one can ignore. This is perhaps made most clear in the recent destruction of 400 elephants in the Central African Republic by armed militia from Sudan. The killing of elephants is not just a wildlife issue. The world now understands that it is a global issue. Not long ago the United Kingdom's Independent newspaper proclaimed that the loss of biodiversity was the greatest threat to humanity. How, amidst NATO's missile-defense problems in Europe, a possible nuclear Iran and the economic failings of modern nations, unemployment and inflation, can the future of the elephant be so urgent? It is not on the radar of the media nor is it a priority for most people. The answer comes from our ability to affirm life in its moral, ethical and, I would urge humanity to consider, in its spiritual dimensions. The elephant helped us walk out of Africa perhaps 60,000 years ago. We learned from tribal elders in east Africa that elephants, because they knew where to find water, helped humanity survive. It was alongside them that we populated the New World. They are central to our evolution. Elie Wiesel of the Foundation for Humanity has even said that to save the elephant is ""an urgent moral imperative."" Read more: Beauty trumps beast in conservation efforts . In Nagoya Japan, in 2010, world environmental ministers agreed on a global strategy to combat the loss of biodiversity. Those countries in Asia that are the driving force behind the mutilation of the greatest land mammal on Earth must join the battle to save the elephant in Africa and the elephant in Asia and the planet's other endangered fauna, such as the rhino and tiger and all the other species that are being so ruthlessly ransacked. In so doing they will save face. In a society fixated on growth and money, TEEB, (The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity) has plainly demonstrated the irreplaceable value of biodiversity, which yearly provides trillions of dollars of value. The forests, oceans, whales and elephants of the world must now enter the balance sheet of ultimate consideration. We have reached the point as a global civilization where we must fight for life and the meaning of life, and much of that stands in the body of the elephant and other fellow species, as well as the forests and the oceans of the world. This battle must not be lost. Elephants are one of the pillars of existence. We must never tell nor have to tell the children -- ""This is where the wild things were.""

"London (CNN) -- With all the tributes to Steve Jobs, one thing tends to get forgotten: the man helped us write. Jobs was the first to give us a real choice of fonts, and thus the ability to express ourselves digitally with emotion, clarity and variety. He made Type Gods of us all. Steve Jobs didn't invent typefaces, of course; I think Johannes Gutenberg may have had a stronger claim to that in Germany when he used his first carved letters in the 1440s. But Jobs realized their value like no one else engaged in personal computers in the early 1980s, and suddenly we were no longer dependent on professional printers, graphic designers and those long dark nights of the soul with rub-down letters. And who did Jobs himself thank for this advance? He credited the people who made the cost of his academic life so expensive at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. He said he dropped out to save his parents spending their entire life savings. And if he hadn't dropped out, he may not have discovered calligraphy. ""Throughout the campus,"" he remembered at an address to students at Stanford in 2005, '""every poster, every label on every drawer, was beautifully hand calligraphied."" So, having dropped out and finding himself a free agent, he decided to take a class in this art. ""I learned about serif and sans serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture, and I found it fascinating."" At the time, the student dropout believed that little he had learned would find a practical application in his life. But things changed. Ten years after college Jobs designed his first Mac, and it came with something unprecedented -- a wide choice of fonts. Originally he hoped to do this on the cheap, and by enlisting the designer Susan Kare he created new bitmap designs that were available in a range of styles and sizes. The original thought was to name them after stops on a local Philadelphia train route close to where Kare had grown up, but Jobs then plumped for the more accessible notion of cities he loved: London, Chicago, Geneva, Toronto, Venice, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. These names had the added advantage of reflecting the typographical character of the cities in question, so London had an old-fashioned serif ""blackletter"" feel that Dickens might have favored, Venice had an artisanal script feel, and Geneva had a cleaner Swiss sans-serif look. For some reason yet to be fully justified, the San Francisco font appeared to be made up of odd letters torn from a newspaper, a digital ransom note. Soon there would be more familiar names added to the mix, including Times New Roman and Helvetica. So this was the beginning of something -- a seismic shift in our everyday relationship with letters and with type. An innovation that, within a decade or so, would place the word ""font"" -- previously a piece of technical language limited to the design and printing trade -- in the vocabulary of every computer user. You can't easily find most of Jobs's original typefaces these days, which may be just as well: they are coarsely pixilated and cumbersome to manipulate (significantly, the typeface that Apple used in its early promotional advertisements -- remember 'Think Different'? -- were in a modern version of good old Garamond, a French style from the 16th century.) But the ability to change fonts on our computers seemed like technology from another planet. Before the Macintosh of 1984, most primitive word processors offered up one dull face, often on a green screen, and good luck trying to italicize it. Now there was a choice of alphabets that did their best to recreate something we were used to from the real world. IBM and Microsoft would soon do their best to copy Apple's lead, while domestic printers (a novel concept at the time) began to be marketed not only on speed but for the variety of their fonts. And here's the thing. Just as we celebrate the new iPhone or the new Kindle, let's observe how primitive is our choice of fonts on these machines, and how far they have to go to catch up with the past. The Notes app on the phone has three choices, and one of them is '""Marker Felt""; the Kindle has a few more, but the choice is still in single figures. Could it be that the one thing that Jobs recognized almost 30 years ago -- the absolute pleasure of the shape of letters -- is being forgotten in a race for miniaturization, speed and the relentless pursuit of gadgetry newness? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Simon Garfield.","Simon Garfield: New iPhone was introduced without Steve Jobs .
He says one of Jobs' great accomplishments was popularization of typefaces .
Suddenly consumers could express themselves through choice of fonts, he says .

"(CNN) -- If North Korea continues with its controversial missile and nuclear tests, it ""will move closer"" to its objective of reaching the United States with nuclear weapons, according to a Pentagon report. During recent heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula, Pyongyang repeatedly threatened the possibility of nuclear attacks against the United States and South Korea, prompting questions on the progress of its weapons program. North Korea's secretiveness has made it hard for Western intelligence agencies to gauge exactly what is going on inside its research facilities. Many clues have come from the regime's large-scale tests such as the long-range rocket launch in December and the underground nuclear detonation in February. The Pentagon's annual report to Congress on Thursday provided an overview of the military threat posed by North Korea, but it didn't say how long it believed it would take the isolated, Stalinist state to develop a fully operational nuclear missile capable of reaching the U.S. mainland. It described North Korea's ballistic missile program as ""ambitious"" and said that ""the pace of its progress will depend, in part, on how many resources it can dedicate to these efforts and how often it conducts tests."" Doubts over North's capabilities . A sign of differing views on North Korea's nuclear missile capabilities among U.S. intelligence agencies emerged last month. Addressing the House Armed Services Committee, a congressman read out an excerpt from a report by the Pentagon's intelligence arm that said it believed with ""moderate confidence"" that the North had nuclear weapons that could be delivered by ballistic missiles, albeit with low ""reliability."" But after the disclosure of that assessment from the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), top U.S. officials including President Barack Obama said the U.S. government didn't think North Korea was yet able to fit a nuclear warhead on a ballistic missile. The Pentagon report Thursday included no reference to the DIA excerpt, which didn't specify the range of the ballistic missiles that it was talking about. The report said that the type of long-range rocket that North Korea launched in December to put a satellite in orbit ""could reach parts of the United States if configured as an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of carrying a nuclear payload."" But it noted that ""a space launch does not test a re-entry vehicle (RV), without which North Korea cannot deliver a weapon to target from an ICBM."" The December launch and the display in April 2012 of an untested but road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missile help underscore ""the threat to regional stability and U.S. national security posed by North Korea,"" according to the report. Like father, like son . Its authors said they didn't expect much change under North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un, from the strategy shaped by his father, Kim Jong Il, who died in December 2011. The focus of that approach, they said, includes ""coercive diplomacy to compel acceptance of its diplomatic, economic and security interests; development of strategic military capabilities to deter external attack;"" and challenges to South Korea and the U.S.-South Korean alliance. Under Kim Jong Un, North Korea has so far continued the pursuit of more advanced nuclear and missile technologies, which according to the report, the regime sees as ""essential to its goals of survival, sovereignty and relevance."" The long-range rocket launch in December and underground nuclear test in February prompted international condemnation and tougher U.N. sanctions. Those measures were followed by intensified threats from Pyongyang, during which the United States said it would deploy additional missile defenses on its West Coast. The Pentagon report also highlighted the murkiness of the North's decision-making processes -- a particular concern during periods of heightened tensions like the past few months. ""Although North Korea is unlikely to attack on a scale that it assesses would risk the survival of its government by inviting overwhelming counterattacks by the ROK or the United States, we do not know how North Korea calculates this threshold of behavior,"" the report said, using the abbreviated form of South Korea's official name, the Republic of Korea. ""North Korea's use of smallscale attacks and provocative acts leaves much room for miscalculation that could spiral into a larger conflict,"" it said. CNN's Alison Harding contributed to this report.","A Pentagon report to Congress gives an overview of North Korea's military threat .

"(CNN) -- Health authorities indicated Friday there have been 361 cases of mumps in central Ohio, a significantly higher number than was reported just a few weeks ago. Most of these cases -- 208, to be specific -- have been linked to Ohio State University in Columbus, the city's health department said. The 361 total includes cases from Franklin, Delaware and Madison counties and was current as of 2:30 p.m. Friday. Some 139 of those diagnosed were students at Ohio State, while a number of others worked at or otherwise had a connection to the university. As recently as March 21, the same agency was reporting 63 mumps cases, of which 45 were tied to the university. The outbreak originated in February with a cluster of cases at Ohio State. Mumps outbreak spread beyond Ohio State campus . Melanie Amato, an Ohio Department of Health spokeswoman, attributes the spike to many students heading home, where they could end up spreading mumps or at least be seen and diagnosed by doctors. ""We don't expect the numbers to go down soon,"" Amato said. Eleven people have been treated at area hospitals for mumps, according to Columbus Public Health. But none were still in hospitals as of Friday, and no deaths have been linked to the disease, Amato said. Those affected range in age between 4 months and 80 years old, with about 60% being female. The Ohio Department of Health reports the first symptoms tied to this outbreak arose on January 7. Jose Rodriguez, a Columbus health department spokesman, has said that the earliest OSU case was on February 11. CNN Health Library: Learn more about mumps . There is a vaccine available for mumps, but it's only 88% effective, Amato points out. She explains: ""A lot of these people who got mumps were vaccinated."" Mumps typically begins with a fever, headache, muscle aches, fatigue and loss of appetite, which is followed by the swelling of salivary glands, according to the CDC. It is ""a highly infectious disease"" that spreads the same way as a cold or flu does -- through respiratory droplets when someone coughs or sneezes. There is no specific treatment for mumps, and patients usually recover after a week or two, but occasionally the disease can cause serious complications such as encephalitis, meningitis, deafness or inflammation of the breasts or ovaries in girls who have reached puberty, the CDC said. Five days of isolation is required, ""and that can be complicated in a university setting,"" according to Rodriguez. Even more frightening -- one-third of cases have no symptoms, he said. Mumps isn't the only infectious disease outbreak that Ohio is dealing with. Earlier this week, authorities reported 68 people had come down with measles in the state, part of what is already an 18-year high of measles cases in the United States. 2013: East Coast mumps outbreak linked to nightclub .","Columbus health department: 361 cases of mumps in central Ohio .

"(CNN) -- The Department of Homeland Security this week announced it is opening the largest immigrant family detention facility in the United States, amid concerns from immigrant-rights groups. The center in Dilley, Texas, was opened on Monday to house the surge of ""family units,"" or women and children who say they fled extreme violence in their native Central American countries to seek asylum in the United States. The privately contracted facility sits on 51 acres and will have 2,400 beds at a cost of $260 million per year to taxpayers, according to local reports. ""The regional refugee crisis in Central America demands a humanitarian response by the United States, not a show of force,"" a coalition of immigrant-rights groups said this week in an open letter to President Barack Obama. ""These mothers have faced unimaginable suffering and danger and have come to the U.S. seeking protection, often with close relatives in the U.S. who are willing and able to provide for them. They are not evading law enforcement; they are seeking out Border Patrol officers,"" the letter added. 5 immigration myths debunked . In a statement at the opening of the detention center, DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson said the facility promotes and highlights ""the border security aspects of the executive actions President Obama announced on Nov. 20."" ""We will continue to work with the governments of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras to address with them the conditions in those three countries that are the 'push' factors for illegal migration from there to here, and to repatriate those of their citizens who came here illegally."" Johnson added. Johnson said the Obama administration also intends to go forward with an ""in-country refugee program"" in the three countries, a program announced last month by Vice President Joe Biden. The program will ""allow parents who are lawfully present in the United States to request access to the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program for their children still in those three countries,"" Johnson said. DHS: More Central Americans apprehended than Mexicans . There are at least three other family detention centers in use by the federal government to house detained immigrant families, including centers in Karnes, Texas, and Berks County, Pennsylvania. A facility in Artesia, New Mexico, is expected to close in the coming weeks, and hundreds of immigrants staying there will get preference for relocating to the Dilley facility. Funding for the centers will expire in late February 2015 if Congress fails to act on a DHS request for supplemental funding for fiscal years 2014 and 2015, Johnson said. Immigrant-rights groups have been vocal in their opposition to the centers, which sprouted this summer as a result of the unprecedented influx of undocumented immigrants from Central America. Beyond the border: Getting there and then what? Earlier this year, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund claimed guards working at the Karnes facility requesting sexual favors in return for money. ""This is unjust and a repudiation of our nation's values and historic commitment to justice for all,"" said Leslie Holman, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.

"(CNN) -- Andile Ndlovu is one of South Africa's most prominent young ballet dancers, an international performer and award winner both at home and overseas. But for Ndlovu to be accepted into the rarefied world of classical dance -- which in South Africa is traditionally seen as an elitist and a predominantly white preserve -- the boy from the rough Soweto townships says he had to overcome outdated stereotypes. ""I used to be picked upon for the way I walk and the way I act or carry myself,"" he says of his time at school, where he became disparagingly known as ""the dude who did ballet."" He even recalls his closest friends teasing him about the tights, shoes, underwear and sparkly clothes that he would have to wear during practice and on stage. But by remaining focused, diligent and passionate about dance, the young Ndlovu never let the jibes get him down and he continued to practice obsessively. In late 2008, this perseverance was rewarded as he was offered a place at The Washington Ballet, one of the most prestigious dance companies in the United States. That year he shot to fame in a production of Don Quixote by the South Africa Ballet Theater. Now 23, Ndlovu has gone on to win awards at the Boston and Cape Town International Ballet competitions, as well as securing prominent roles in numerous ballet productions across the world. This success, he hopes, will eventually enable him to change conventionally held views not only of black dancers but male ballet dancers in general. ""What I wanted was to change people's minds in South Africa about black ballet dancers. I wanted to change that view, because everybody used to put it in a category for the elite people or, you know, it's only for a certain racial group,"" he says. ""I [want to] set the bar for anybody else that's coming, that's growing up, that's coming behind, and they will learn from my actions and what I do and hopefully I become a role model for them, especially South Africans,"" he adds.","Andile Ndlovu is a ballet dancer from the township of Soweto, South Africa .

"Washington (CNN) -- Senior State Department and Diplomatic Security officials may have covered up or stopped investigations of inappropriate or even criminal misconduct by staff, according to an internal memo from the department's Office of the Inspector General. The timeline surrounding the allegations places the incidents during former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's tenure, opening the possibility that a widening scandal might taint both her record and her possible political aspirations. Clinton has also taken heat for the department's response to the September 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya. Hillary Clinton Tweets the future is 'TBD' The memo itself, purportedly written by Ambassador Larry Dinger, describes some of the information as coming from office chatter. ""Sometimes the sources are one or more agents who became aware of the case from colleagues in what, given cubicles, can be a collegial environment,"" the memo says. Regarding the latest allegations, CNN was provided the documents by a lawyer for a whistle-blower who is a former senior inspector general investigator. They include: . • An active U.S. ambassador ""routinely ditched his protective security detail in order to solicit sexual favors from both prostitutes and minor children,"" the memo says. The ambassador's protective detail and others ""were well aware of the behavior,"" the memo asserts. When a diplomatic security officer tried to investigate, undersecretary of state for management Patrick Kennedy allegedly ordered the investigator ""not to open a formal investigation."" On Tuesday, CNN obtained a statement from the ambassador, who vigorously denied the allegations, calling them ""baseless."" A source close to the investigation of the ambassador told CNN that the ambassador's security detail reported to the inspector general that the ambassador would leave his house at night without notifying the detail. The detail followed the ambassador and saw the ambassador once go to a park that's known for illegal activity, the source told CNN. The detail said they never witnessed the ambassador engage in any sexual activity, the source said. The ambassador went to Washington and was asked what he was doing and he denied any wrongdoing, the source told CNN. The ambassador explained that sometimes he fights with his wife, needs air and he goes for a walk in the park because he likes it. Kennedy also issued a statement Tuesday, saying it is his responsibility ""to make sure the department and all of our employees -- no matter their rank -- are held to the highest standard, and I have never once interfered, nor would I condone interfering, in any investigation."" • A State Department security official in Beirut allegedly ""engaged in sexual assaults"" against foreign nationals working as embassy guards. The security official, the Office of the Inspector General says, was also accused of committing ""similar assaults during assignments in Baghdad, and possibly Khartoum and Monrovia."" The office's memo says that an inspector general's investigator who went to Beirut to try to conduct an investigation was not given enough time to complete the job. • A member of Clinton's security detail allegedly ""engaged prostitutes while on official trips in foreign countries."" The inspector general's agent assigned to investigate ""concluded"" that the ""prostitution problem was endemic."" • In Iraq, an ""underground drug ring"" may have been operating near the U.S. Embassy and ""supplying"" drugs to State Department security contractors, but an agent sent to investigate the allegations was prevented from completing the job. The allegations were first reported Monday by CBS. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki responded Monday. Controversies knock Obama off balance . ""We hold all employees to the highest standards,"" she said. ""We take allegations of misconduct seriously and we investigate thoroughly. All cases mentioned in the CBS report were thoroughly investigated and under investigation, and the department continues to take action."" During a Tuesday State briefing with reporters, Psaki reiterated that the memo contains ""unsubstantiated allegations"" and that some cases are ongoing and some are closed. But she would not, though repeatedly pressed by reporters, specify exactly which ones were open or closed. ""As a matter of policy, I'm not going to talk"" about specific cases, she said. ""We take every allegation seriously,"" Psaki added. ""We are seeing through the process."" On Tuesday, Nicholas Merrill, a spokesman for Hillary Clinton, said Clinton was completely unaware of any of the investigations mentioned in the Office of the Inspector General's reports and memos, including the case involving her personal security detail allegedly soliciting prostitutes. ""We learned of it from the media and don't know anything beyond what's been reported,"" Merrill told CNN in a written statement. Clinton officially left her post in February. Clinton's bio undergoes changes . What's behind Clinton's drop in poll numbers? Also Tuesday, U.S. Rep. Ed Royce, R-California, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said he has asked his staff to begin an investigation into the allegations, and sent a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry demanding an explanation. ""The notion that any or all of these cases would not be investigated thoroughly by the Department is unacceptable,"" Royce wrote in his letter to Kerry. CNN obtained a draft, dated December 2012, of a report by the inspector general's office evaluating the performance of the department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security Special Investigations Division. The report says that the bureau ""lacks a firewall"" that would preclude higher-ups from ""exercising undue influence in particular cases."" The bureau doesn't have a manual with approved guidelines on how to investigate cases, the report also says. Investigators with the inspector general's office ""discovered uncertainty"" among state agents about how to conduct thorough investigations, and noted that not going through the proper mechanisms can ""ruin"" a potential criminal investigation. The report also calls the department's Criminal Investigations Division ""unwieldy"" and says that ""frequent agent turnover"" makes it harder for the Bureau of Diplomatic Security to conduct investigations. The inspector general's office published a February 2013 final report whose key findings are, largely, the same as stated in the December 2012 draft. The division's current management structure, the report says, does not ""foster independence from career pressures and creates significant potential for undue influence, favoritism, and potential retribution. CNN's Jessica Yellin and Elise Labott contributed to this report.","House committee chief says he's asked his staff to begin an investigation .

"(CNN) -- If the trajectory of American daily life keeps heading in its current direction, the country may end up with only two dominant occupations: . -- Carrying stuff in boxes to people's houses. -- And keeping a watchful eye on those same people so they don't hurt each other or steal things when they do leave their homes. For all the talk about how e-commerce is outpacing the performance of traditional retail sales in brick-and-mortar stores, the men and women who could gain the most from the boom in online merchandising are not Web designers or those who come up with clever new shopping apps, but workers who perform one of the oldest jobs in the world: . Lugging packages from the curb to someone's front door. It's one task that can't be accomplished in cyberspace. During the 2013 holiday season, according to the Wall Street Journal, retail stores drew only about half of the foot traffic that they did three years earlier. And during the peak holiday shopping period, online sales increased by more than double the rate of sales at traditional stores. For every shopper who doesn't leave a store carrying a bag full of merchandise, but instead places orders online, there's someone who has to bring those items to the residence. And in the long run, the major beneficiaries of this shift in habits could very well turn out to be the people who undertake a decidedly low-technology endeavor: grabbing a box from the back of a truck and walking with it to a house. You can already see the effects of this in statistics kept by the United States Postal Service. It's no secret that, in our era of e-mails and texts, the number of first-class letters delivered by the post office has plummeted. As recently as 2008, the Postal Service reported that it was delivering 90.7 billion letters annually. By last year, that number was down to 65.8 billion. But the Postal Service's numbers for delivering packages, as opposed to letters, have actually gone up. In 2008, it delivered 3.3. billion packages; that had grown to 3.7 billion packages by last year. United Parcel Service says it delivers 16.3 million packages and documents worldwide every day -- 4.1 billion a year. Some time-honored, pre-digital-era manufacturing firms have figured out a way to make the lug-the-package-to-the-house business model work for them, too. International Paper Co., according to the Journal, ""is among the companies profiting from new digital habits. It bought several makers of corrugated cardboard boxes, which now fill with goods shipped by online retailers like Amazon. The Memphis-based paper company said it has a 35 percent market share."" But if carrying boxes is one line of work that has legs, another -- just as old-line -- may become even more in demand as the years go by. We can tell ourselves that our worlds are full of social media friends and amiable followers, yet the growth in industries devoted to protecting us from each other, both on the streets and in the electronic ether, betrays a certain distrust in the purportedly benign intentions of our fellow citizens. It's not just the checkpoints at airports, and surveillance cameras on street corners, and cybercrime-fighting software offered by manufacturers; Samuel Bowles and Arjun Jayadev, writing in the New York Times, noted, ""another dubious first for America: We now employ as many private security guards as high school teachers -- over one million of them, or nearly double their number in 1980. ... What is happening in America today is both unprecedented in our history, and virtually unique among Western democratic nations. The share of our labor force devoted to guard labor has risen fivefold since 1890."" This caution on the part of both citizens and industry may be warranted, but Bowles and Jayadev, reflecting on the melancholy underlying message of this, point out what philosopher John Stuart Mill wrote in 1848: ""It is lamentable to think how a great proportion of all efforts and talents in the world are employed in merely neutralizing one another."" Neutralizing one another or, more cheerily, showing up bearing boxes. The Postal Service reports that its letter carriers and package-deliverers drive 4 million miles every day. UPS operates a delivery fleet consisting of 96,028 cars, vans, tractors and motorcycles, as well as 237 aircraft. As the inexorable shift to e-commerce becomes the standard way of shopping, those numbers can only be expected to increase. And the private-security industry? That other growth field? There is an outside chance that it could eventually dwindle: if we should someday decide to put our faith in the sweet intentions and endless goodwill of our fellow citizens, both the ones we can see and the ones who invisibly make their way into our computers. Until then, though, there is a multitude of home-security and break-in-alarm products for sale online. And a multitude of men and women hired to carry them to the double-locked front door.","Bob Greene: America may end up with only two dominant occupations .
Greene: One is carrying stuff to people's homes, the other is protecting them .
He says with the rise of online shopping, more people need delivery services .
Greene: The other growth field is private security; we employ more guards now ."
"(CNN) -- He's won six medals in the Winter Olympics, including a gold in 2008, and a bronze just a few months ago in Sochi. Bode Miller's methods, however, have never been orthodox. ""I never really worked very goal-oriented,"" he admits. ""I think I've had some great results and I've had a long career, so, I mean, I'm happy about that. But I didn't really ever have goals, the way that most people did."" Miller has always intrigued media and fans alike. An unconventional upbringing in a New Hampshire log cabin with no electricity or running water gave way to a skiing career in which, for Miller, his natural talent and love of the sport always won out over, well, winning. Indeed, his goal, as stated in his book ""Bode: Go fast, Be Good, Have Fun"" was to ski ""as fast as the natural universe would allow."" Back home after an emotional Olympics in Sochi, where Miller cried during a live interview with NBC's Christin Cooper when asked about the recent death of his brother, Miller is focusing on another project: his Turtle Ridge Foundation. Miller began the foundation after close friend Cameron Shaw-Doran suffered a traumatic injury that left him paralyzed from the chest down. ""I was trying to help him get re-involved in sports. He was a great athlete before his injury and was really having a hard time sort of adapting, which is a really tough process when you're injured like that,"" says Miller. ""Just to watch him go through that I saw how hard it was and how little support there was for him."" The experience motivated Miller to find ways to help get disabled and injured athletes more involved in sports. ""We provide the sporting equipment for them and the environment that allows them to participate in whatever sport that is,"" Miller explains. Shaw-Doran serves as director of equipment development for Turtle Ridge, and Miller has called on friends and associates from across the sporting world to create and adapt equipment to help adaptive skiers and adaptive athletes in other sports. A major annual event for Turtle Ridge is Bodefest, an all-day ski and barbecue extravaganza on Miller's home turf of Cannon Mountain, New Hampshire, complete with autographs, an auction and a chance for children to race their idol. Watching Miller hurtle down the mountain, swarmed by a speeding army of tiny ""Bodephiles,"" it's a wonder and a testament to his skills that the whole thing doesn't end in a giant human snowball. ""All the kids want to try and get on the lift with me for at least one run and there's 400 kids or so. It turns into a bit of pandemonium on the way down,"" Miller says. Not only is Bodefest a fundraiser, but it's also an opportunity for adaptive athletes to try some of the new equipment on the late-season snow. ""The program's really just changed my life,"" says adaptive skier Owen Anketell, who has a condition that affects the muscles in his lower legs. ""I never thought that I'd be able to ski even though I'm in a wheelchair -- or bike -- but this program's really changed my opinion on adaptive sports."" ""The key is empowering,"" says Miller. ""When we build some of our ski equipment and you give it to a kid who never had the chance to go up and experience what it is to ski down a giant mountain and you watch how life-changing that can be for them, I think it's really -- it's pretty incredible."" The sentiment seems to fit with Miller's general philosophy of focusing on how the sport makes you feel, rather than the end game, a feeling he believes everyone is entitled to, regardless of ability. It may not be competition, but it is a goal he can take into retirement -- and still win.","Bode Miller started the Turtle Ridge Foundation after a close friend was paralyzed .

"(CNN) -- French Defense Minister Gerard Longuet traveled to Afghanistan to discuss security with local authorities, a spokesman said Saturday, a day after Allied forces suffered heavy losses in the country. A helicopter crash killed six U.S. Marines and a separate attack killed four French soldiers Friday, prompting Paris to consider an early troop withdrawal. ""If France does not manage to find a solution with the Afghan authorities to ensure better security of the French soldiers, then we will seriously question our military presence in the country. It is too early to speculate what actions would be taken. The minister will return when he feels he has the information and assurances he is looking for,"" said Col. Thierry Burkhard, spokesman for the defense ministry. President Nicolas Sarkozy has said he was suspending French training operations and combat help as a result of the attack, which injured 15 others. ""The French army is not in Afghanistan to be shot at by Afghan soldiers,"" he said. France could bring its troops back early from Afghanistan if the necessary security is not restored, Sarkozy said. France has 3,935 troops in Afghanistan, according NATO's International Security Assistance Force. The attack in eastern Afghanistan followed a similar shooting last month by an Afghan soldier that killed two French soldiers serving in an engineers' regiment. Also Saturday, the U.S. Department of Defense identified six Marines who were killed in Afghanistan when their helicopter crashed. Jesse W. Stites, 23; Kevin J. Reinhard, 25; and Joseph D. Logan, 22, were all Marine corporals. They hailed from North Beach, Maryland; Colonia, New Jersey; and Willis, Texas, respectively. Master Sgt. Travis W. Riddick, 40, of Centerville, Iowa, also lost his life. Two officers were also aboard the CH-53 helicopter: Capt. Daniel D. Bartle, 27, of Ferndale, Washington; and Capt. Nathan R. McHone, 29, of Crystal Lake, Illinois. They were assigned to Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron 363, Marine Aircraft Group 24, 1st Marine Aircraft Wing, III Marine Expeditionary Force, Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii. The NATO-led force reported no enemy activity in the area of Friday's crash, but the Taliban claimed credit for bringing down the chopper. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen paid tribute to those killed and injured Friday, saying it was a ""very sad day"" for ISAF troops in Afghanistan and for France. ""Such tragic incidents are terrible and grab headlines, but they are isolated,"" he said. ""The reality is that every day, 130,000 ISAF troops from 50 nations fight and train with over 300,000 Afghan soldiers. That takes a lot of trust among a lot of soldiers. ""We have the same goal. An Afghanistan that is responsible for its own security. That is what Afghans want. And we remain committed to helping Afghans.""

"(CNN) -- ""Sitting in class, second grade, teachers would put me outside the hallway because I had been ticking so loud I was a 'distraction,'"" recalled 25-year-old Amber Comfort. ""Teachers would walk by me back and forth and say 'you'd better stop that before you get into my class next year.' Things that were just completely obscene, that you would never expect the world to be, and I had to deal with on a daily basis."" From the age of five, Comfort has suffered from Tourette's syndrome, a neurological disorder that causes her to make involuntary movements and loud noises, known as tics. For almost 20 years, the condition has shaped every moment of her life. ""I don't remember any parts of ever being tic free,"" she said. ""There's not a day that's gone by that I don't remember moving or making noise when I couldn't help it."" But she has not let Tourette's dictate how she lives. Comfort graduated from high school with honors and was even accepted to college on full scholarship. But her uncontrollable outbursts have made it hard to continue her education or even hold down a steady job. There is one thing that comes easy though. Singing. She loves to sing, and when she does, her tics are curiously absent. ""Singing is what gets me through a lot of hard days. When I'm on the computer, when I'm driving, when I write poetry, basically anything with a sense of focus,"" Comfort explained. ""When I have to worry about my tics I do just that -- I worry about my tics."" Deep brain stimulation . There is no cure for Tourette's syndrome. But after years of suffering and unsuccessful therapies, Comfort was selected for experimental surgery by specialists from the University of Florida's Center for Movement Disorders. The procedure is called deep brain stimulation (DBS), where small electrodes are implanted into the brain to stimulate affected regions in patients with movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease or tremors. The delivery of electricity is at the root of what makes DBS work. The electrodes are attached to an impulse generator, or pacemaker, implanted under the patient's skin, which provides electrical impulses to the affected region of the brain. By providing impulses to circuits in the brain associated with a specific motor skill, it's possible to change the connections between neurons and stop the abnormal activity that causes the symptoms. DBS was first approved for tremors in 1997 and since then more than 100,000 patients have had the procedure. But Comfort's surgery would be the first time the technique had been used for Tourette's. Tourette's syndrome is characterized by an impulsivity that combines both emotion and motor activity and makes the underlying neurology differ from that of Parkinson's and other conditions previously treated with DBS. ""The difference in Tourette is the movement isn't there all the time,"" explained neurologist Dr. Michael Okun, co-director of the Center for Movement Disorders and author of ""Parkinson's Treatment: 10 Secrets to a Happier Life with Parkinson's Disease."" ""The patients that have a tic, they get this build up; they call it a premonitory urge. They feel like they need to move and until they move, they don't feel better."" This urge to tic is a daily woe for people like Comfort. ""It's like having 15 mosquito bites that you can't itch,"" she said. ""There's no way to ever tell they are coming."" Until now, treatments available for Tourette's have been behavioral therapy and drug medications. These treatments, however, only manage the severity of tics to make them less disruptive and do not prevent them. ""Without my medications, I am one of the worst cases the doctors have ever seen in the United States,"" said Comfort. Experimental surgery . In September 2014, Comfort had the DBS electrodes implanted in her brain -- a 12-hour process that involved six operations. In addition to the standard electrode leads, she had a new grid-like device implanted on top of her brain -- an experimental procedure intended to gather information from her brain that could not only lessen her tics, but maybe someday stop them. Not only did Comfort have four holes drilled into her skull, but she was awake throughout the process. ""The way sedatives work is by suppressing brain activity, so we get better recordings if we don't use any sedatives,"" explained Dr. Kelly Foote, also co-director of the Center for Movement Disorders, who performed the surgery. The team uses music to help relax the patient while the painless, but stressful, procedure is carried out. ""We let them pick the music to take the focus off the fact that I am drilling a hole in their head, and cutting their scalp and that sort of thing,"" said Foote. Comfort's surgery was a success, but implanting the stimulation and recording devices is just the start of the DBS process. Okun and Foote will now monitor Comfort's brain activity over the next six to 12 months. The grid will provide insight into the underlying cause of her Tourette's syndrome and allow the doctors to regulate the electrical impulses so that they can begin to manage and maybe someday, eliminate her tics. For Comfort, this is her chance to finally live a normal life. ""If it's a chance to change my life for the better and to make sure I don't have to deal with this anymore, I'm up for it,"" said Comfort. ""I have had this 20 years, and I think I've done my time.""","Tourette syndrome causes sufferers to make involuntary movements and noises .

"(CNN) -- Recently, Loyola Law School in Los Angeles issued a memo to its students outlining what not to wear to work-study jobs. For one: low-cut tops. Another: those sexy Louboutins. ""I really don't need to mention that cleavage and stiletto heels are not appropriate office wear (outside of ridiculous lawyer TV shows), do I?"" asks the author of a memo entitled ""Ethics, Professionalism and Course Requirements for Off Campus Externs"" but then goes on to mention it anyway. ""The legal community is small in L.A. and judges and lawyers who have unprofessional experiences with externs talk freely amongst themselves about the experiences. It can be embarrassing."" It can also be sexist. I'm talking about the memo, of course, which offers no such guidelines on appearance for men, if we're to assume that men aren't among those whose cleavage and heels are generating whispers within L.A. courtrooms. The memo's implication is that there's a relationship between how women look and how well they do their jobs, and that it's okay to judge a woman on her appearance. It's one thing to acknowledge that a bias exists in society, but quite another to insist on kowtowing to it, and to expectations that are, in most cases, initiated and maintained by men, but not imposed on men. Women are very often reduced to, or at least measured by, their looks, in every industry, and the message can be infuriatingly contradictory. Look good, but not too good. Pay attention to vanity, but don't be obvious about it. Be different, but about the same as everyone else. The Loyola memo noted that the school had received ""complaints from supervisors"" about students' dress, though it isn't specific about the nature or number of the complaints. While it's possible that some women may go overboard, perhaps the topic could have been addressed with the individual(s) against whom the complaints were filed. After all, overboard is both subjective and confusing. At least one law professor advised women to get ahead by wearing ""skirts to appeal to men, makeup to look healthy and competent, and heels to appear more powerful."" What's a constant, though, is that looks matter, and usually that attractiveness pays. So why shouldn't women, who face any number of disadvantages in the workplace, use what they can to get ahead? According to research by Daniel Hamermesh, author of ""Beauty Pays: Why Attractive People are More Successful,"" the top one-third of attractive females earns about 10% more annually than those in the bottom sixth of the genetic pool. A 2006 study from the University of Helsinki that looked at the role of beauty in politics found that the better-looking the candidate, the more competent, trustworthy and likeable he or she was perceived to be. When it comes to dress, a recent Harvard Business School study found that dressing distinctly could make a woman appear confident and influential, two qualities especially relevant for courtroom lawyers. We can't blame Loyola Law School for society's obsession with appearance, and if judges and juries are indeed forming opinions about female lawyers' abilities based on the length of their skirts, it's important for would-be lawyers to recognize that. It's not right, but perhaps it's a reality. Law in particular is a profession that relies heavily on the opinions and very real biases of others. That said, we can hold the school responsible for helping to perpetuate the mixed messages women receive about their appearance, and for issuing a memo that, while perhaps useful in spirit, was insulting and condescending in tone. Loyola is a highly rated law school; it stands to reason that the students accepted there have at least some common sense and social awareness. Presumably there are some brains behind those bodies. By widely issuing the memo using the language it did, Loyola expressed doubt in the abilities of its female students to make their own decisions regarding something as basic as what to wear. It's important for a school that's in the business of educating women to recognize and support the idea that women can be both smart and attractive; to help shift the conversation from an either/or. Meanwhile, women should keep pushing the boundaries and resisting definitions, and wearing what they deem appropriate. There was a time, after all, that pantsuits were considered ""shocking"" courtroom garb, a convention that changed because women insisted it change. With persistence, eventually what will matter most is how women perform their jobs, and not which shoes they happened to choose that morning. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Peggy Drexler.","A Loyola Law School memo advises students what not to wear to work-study jobs .

"New York (CNN) -- Three bikers have been indicted in connection with a well-publicized clash with a New York SUV driver, the Manhattan District Attorney's office said Friday. Craig Wright, 29, and Reginald Chance, 37, were indicted Friday, according to the district attorney's office. A third man, Robert Sims, 35, was indicted on Thursday, it said. Authorities say Alexander Lien was chased by bikers after he initially bumped one during a biker rally on September 29. When his SUV was surrounded by several bikers, Lien called 9-1-1, told police he feared for his life and drove off, running over bikers and critically injuring one. Lien's wife and 2-year-old daughter were in the vehicle with him. Lien has not been charged. The chase that followed ended in traffic. Police say Lien's windows were smashed; he was dragged out of the SUV and beaten. He was treated and released from a hospital. Officials did not detail the formal charges against the three men. In New York, charges in an indictment are not announced until defendants have been arraigned and can enter a plea. Chance was accused of using his helmet to smash the SUV window, according to police. The lawyer for Chance concedes his client ""overreacted,"" but claims he did not take part in beating the driver. Authorities arrested Wright for allegedly hitting the SUV driver through the window of his vehicle. Sims was accused of stomping on the driver after he was pulled from his SUV, authorities said. Wright, Chance and Sims are scheduled to be arraigned on October 30, according to the district attorney's office. At least seven people have been arrested, including the three who were indicted. Authorities, who have appealed for the public's help in identifying people in photos, haven't ruled out more arrests or charges. Meanwhile, a New York Police officer who works in Internal Affairs joins the ranks of at least two others with the NYPD who waited several days to tell their superiors they were at the rally where the SUV driver was beaten and kicked, according to the lawyer for the officer. ""He did what he had to do (by coming forward),"" the officer's attorney, Pat Bonanno, told CNN. A law enforcement source, with knowledge of the case, told CNN the Internal Affairs officer didn't report he was at the rally for at least a week. CNN is withholding the officer's name, who worked for Internal Affairs for five years, because he has not been charged with any wrongdoing at this time. The story was first reported by DNAInfo.com, a site specializing in crime news. Bonanno says the officer belongs to a motorcycle club and was riding with hundreds of bikers who participated in the September 29th rally, but insists he didn't witness the assault on Lien. ""He wasn't aware of anything of the nature posted on YouTube and he doesn't have any firsthand knowledge of what was going on,"" Bonanno said. ""Once all the videos are reviewed and witnesses interviewed, we'll find that my client has no culpability for anything that happened that day."" Bonanno offered no explanation as to why the officer waited so long to tell his superiors he was there. ""That will be addressed in an appropriate time and manner,"" he said. The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, tells CNN authorities are investigating his account. Law enforcement sources have told CNN there were no on-duty police officers riding with the bikers in an undercover capacity. NYPD Deputy Commissioner John McCarthy declined comment as did the Manhattan District Attorney's office. At least two other officers are under investigation. One of them is Detective Wojciech Braszczok, who faces three felony counts including gang assault. Prosecutors say the off-duty cop is on video allegedly using his fist to bash in the rear window of Lien's SUV and kick it. Braszczok's lawyer has denied his client did anything wrong and says video will exonerate him. Another law enforcement source has told CNN another off-duty officer who didn't immediately report the incident was riding with Braszczok. That officer, according to sources, has been reassigned to a desk job. He is not believed to have witnessed the assault and is not expected to be charged, said the source, who was spoke on condition of anonymity. Outlaws or stunt artists?

"(CNN) -- As the kids trooped back into the suburban Atlanta elementary school that was stormed by a gunman earlier this week, everyone was talking about Antoinette Tuff. The bookkeeper, an eight-year veteran of the DeKalb County school district, talked suspect Michael Brandon Hill into surrendering after a brief standoff with police Tuesday afternoon. Faced with an armed 20-year-old who told her he was off his medication for a mental disorder, Tuff shared stories of heartbreak from her own life to help calm him down -- a recent divorce, a son with multiple disabilities. Tuff was off Thursday as the students returned to Ronald E. McNair Discovery Learning Academy. But Principal Brian Bolden said he credited Tuff's quick thinking for avoiding what could have been a major tragedy. ""Her name, Antoinette Tuff, says everything about her,"" Bolden said. ""Tough. She has always been that way from the first time I met her."" Online, a Facebook page calls for Tuff to be awarded the Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, while praise overflowed on Twitter. ""Antoinette Tuff used kindness and love in the face of terror, saved lives and showed true courage. Bravo Ms. Tuff,"" Kathy Groob wrote from Covington, Kentucky, in a typical reaction on Twitter. And in New York, Francis Lam added, ""Everyone: learn negotiation from her."" Chris Voss, a former FBI hostage negotiator, said Tuff's performance was ""amazing."" ""She didn't do anything where she acted like a victim,"" Voss told CNN's ""New Day."" ""She didn't say, 'Please, don't hurt anybody.' She was very direct ... she actually calmed the dispatcher down."" Her tone of voice and matter-of-fact manner with Hill ""did not encourage predatory behavior,"" Voss said. Georgia school shooting suspect was arrested in March . The recording of Tuff's 911 call relays how calm she was. ""It's going to be all right, sweetie,"" she tells Hill at one point in the call. ""I just want you to know I love you, though, OK? And I'm proud of you. That's a good thing that you're just giving up and don't worry about it. We all go through something in life. No, you don't want that. You going to be OK. ""I thought the same thing, you know, I tried to commit suicide last year after my husband left me. But look at me now. I'm still working and everything is OK."" Tuff, 46, and her husband separated in 2012 after 26 years of marriage, and their divorce became final in June, according to court records. Their son is 22. A neighbor, Charlie Smith, said Tuff is friendly, but reserved. Their conversations have typically been limited to waves and pleasantries, she said. ""Everybody's doing their own thing, going to their own jobs, and when you come home you've got a lot to do,"" said Smith, who learned of her neighbor's role in the McNair standoff on television. ""She handled it really well,"" Smith said. Another nearby resident, Lula Rivers, said Tuff ""sacrificed herself"" for the children in her care, putting herself at mortal risk if things had gone differently. ""I am a retired teacher.

"(CNN) -- Is ballet dying? Isabella Boylston, the 27-year-old new principal dancer at the American Ballet Theatre, says it's not. Born in Idaho, she started dancing at 3 even though no one in her family knew anything about it. Her love for ballet has taken her touring around the world. While ballet is still very much admired, this classical and rigorous art form is no longer enjoying the popularity it once had in its glory heydays. ""For most of the 20th century, including the entire post-war period, ballet was central to our cultural life. Now more than ever before it needs to be connected to the culture and the direction we're heading,"" says Jennifer Homans, a dance critic who has written about the history of ballet. Homans says the tremendous social changes that occurred after the 1990s affected ballet's cultural prominence. The important question now is: What is the place of ballet in a rapidly changing and high-tech society where people like to watch three-minute YouTube videos or check text messages constantly? To help revitalize ballet in the 21st century, New York University is opening the Center for Ballet and the Arts on September 22. ""The big issue is the future of ballet. It is being reinvented as we speak -- and that takes time, talent and resources,"" says Homans, who is the heading the center. With this new ballet think tank, and with dancers like Boylston who is full of optimism, will ballet leap gracefully into the 22nd century? Time will tell. CNN spoke with Boylston about what it's like to live and breathe ballet today. Why should we care about ballet? Ballet is such a unique art form. You can say things through dance that you could never express in words, and ballet has the ability to touch people on a deep, abstract level. In some ways, ballet is more valuable now than ever. Everything today is so fast-paced and technologically overloaded -- people are constantly staring into computers or their phone screens for entertainment. But going to the theater to see a ballet is unique in that it's completely live and in the moment -- unfiltered and unedited. It's a real and tangible meditation. What sparked your passion for dance? I was about 11 when I completely fell in love with ballet. I was going to this little ballet school situated above a tavern, and we had live piano music, which is really rare for ballet class at that age. My teacher would bring a bag full of silk scarves and at the end of each class we would each take one and dance around and improvise to the music. It felt so free and was the perfect outlet for my creativity. I also loved watching dance movies. I loved ""Center Stage"" and ""The Turning Point."" Do you have a favorite character? So far, it's been Giselle. It's about a girl who falls in love for the first time and she's on this incredible high, then she gets betrayed and everything comes crashing down. She goes completely mad in front of everyone onstage and dies. In the second act she comes back as a spirit and finds forgiveness within herself. When I performed it this past season, I felt like I became her. It was so emotional, and I could feel so much support from the other dancers onstage. Everyone was invested in the story. Another favorite role is Odette/Odile in ""Swan Lake."" The Tchaikovsky score is incredible, and I love the animalistic swan imagery. It's a fun challenge to play up the contrast between White Swan and the Black Swan. What are the 3 most painful things you've ever had to do? Most people don't realize how athletic ballet is -- you have to be so mentally strong to be a dancer. One of the toughest things I had to do was Act 2 of ""Swan Lake"" when I was in the Corps de Ballet. You have to stand very still on one leg in a position called b plus for what seems like an eternity, after jumping and doing hard dancing. Your feet cramp and everything hurts. When I first performed it as a teenager, I think I had tears streaming down my face. But then you learn how to pace yourself and it becomes more enjoyable. Another ballet is ""Theme and Variations,"" by George Balanchine. It's definitely one of the hardest things I've done. You get unbelievably tired, to the point that it feels almost impossible to get through. I've seen people throw up in the wings from exhaustion after it. It's the same with Black Swan Pas de Deux from ""Swan Lake"". But, I don't focus on the pain. We love what we do. And it's the best feeling when you get through something really physically hard and the curtain comes down and you've given it your all physically and emotionally. How many hours do your dance every day? On average, I probably dance for 7 to 9 hours a day. We start every day with ballet ""class,"" which is a series of exercises you do to maintain strength and warm up. That's followed by rehearsals and sometimes a performance at night. What do you say to people who say ballet is boring? They've probably never seen a great ballet with great dancers. For instance, if you watch a bad football game it can be boring, too. Ballet has something for everyone to admire. If you don't like the choreography, you can listen to the music, and if you hate that too, then at least there are beautiful people onstage. There are some young choreographers working today like Justin Peck, who make ballets that are the farthest thing from boring. We are making a dance film together that will come out later this year. Stay tuned! Do your feet hurt all the time? Actually, no. Your feet become accustomed to being en pointe and our pointe shoes are surprisingly supportive, taking the stress off your toes. Other parts of my body hurt though. Ironically, the harder I'm working the less pain I have, because your body gets into crazy shape. Any indulgences? I've been pretty lucky and can eat pretty much whatever I want, especially when we are in season. On a show day I always have a bacon egg and cheese sandwich for breakfast. I don't eat a lot of sweets. My favorite food is pasta, specifically bucatini all'amatriciana, which I discovered when I was performing in Rome. And I love having a glass of wine after a show.","Isabella Boylston is a principal dancer at the American Ballet Theatre in New York City .

"(CNN) -- Zach Sobiech, 18, passed away Monday morning, surrounded by family and friends. In the past few weeks, donations to Zach's cause -- the Children's Cancer Research Fund -- skyrocketed, as did downloads of his song, ""Clouds,"" which at the time of his death had more than 2.9 million page views on YouTube. Listen to ""Clouds"" ""We'd like to thank those people who listened with their hearts and helped Zach bring his message and his music to the world,"" the Sobiech family said in a statement. When he was 14, Zach was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, a type of bone cancer that mostly strikes children. His prognosis wasn't great. Last May, with no more treatment options, he was given a year to live. Zach began writing music after his cancer was diagnosed. His mom, Laura, was cleaning the family room downstairs last year when she found a folded-up piece of paper. She unfolded it to make sure it wasn't a homework assignment. ""I read through it and then I realized what I was reading,"" she said. It was his first song, ""Clouds."" Zach wrote it for himself and his family. He wrote many more in the following years. Watch celebrities sing along to ""Clouds"" ""I fell down, down, down into this dark and lonely hole,"" he sings at the beginning of the song, his voice beautiful, mellow -- kind of reminiscent of Jack Johnson's. When Zach's song was posted to YouTube last year it quickly went viral. Recently dozens of celebrities posted a response -- joining forces to lip sync to Zach's voice singing ""Clouds."" ""And we'll go up, up, up, but I'll climb a little higher,"" sang Jason Mraz, Anna Faris and Rainn Wilson. ""Go up in the clouds because the view's a little nicer up here, my dear,"" sang Bryan Cranston and Rachel Bilson, Ashley Tisdale and Colbie Caillat. ""It won't be long now,"" sang the Lumineers. ""If only,"" sang Sarah Silverman, ""I had a little bit more time."" It was a hello to Zach, and a farewell. It was a collective expression of love and gratitude. The motley crew of celebrities on the video was assembled by Wilson, an actor, and director/actor Justin Baldoni, who directed a short documentary about Zach for his compelling online reality series, ""My Last Days,"" which runs on Wilson's SoulPancake YouTube channel. Get to know Zach . ""Going out to see Zach in Minnesota was one of the greatest experiences of my life,"" said Baldoni. ""To make the choice to be happy despite whatever sad or tragic circumstances you may be living through ... he is this old soul who inspires everyone he meets. You leave and you think: 'I want to be a better person.'"" Watch Baldoni's film and you can see why. There's Zach, a fresh-faced Minnesotan teenager, in one of the opening frames, saying: ""I want everyone to know: You don't have to find out you're dying to start living."" He tells us at the beginning of the film: ""You know most people live kind of in the middle, in between 'all your dreams come true' and 'you're dying,' and it's a very comfortable place to live. I'm living on the two extreme ends, so you have really, really good days and you have really, really bad days."" He lived on those extreme ends for the better part of the past four years. And how gloriously. In his final days, Zach slept a lot. Once in awhile he was able to muster up enough energy to bring out his guitar and play. ""It's those times when we remember how it used to be,"" said his mom. She told me about a trip the family took last year, ""a sort of pilgrimage to Europe,"" with 10 intense days of sightseeing. ""We packed a lot into those 10 days,"" she recalled, ""and maybe these past 3Â½ years have been like that pilgrimage. I haven't had the chance to let it sink in. I don't let myself go to that place of grief. There will be plenty of time to think about what we have lost later."" And maybe, she said, that is the lesson here: that no matter where you are in life, look at what you have and be grateful. It's the kind of thing you hear all the time, but putting it into action takes some work. ""That's what Zach's always been really good at: recognizing what is good and being grateful for it,"" Laura said. ""He taught all of us how it's done."" Taylor Engel, one of the YouTube commenters on Zach's video, writes: ""Well, you got a 6', 220 pound man sobbing his face off here. Prayers and thoughts with you, Zach...I hope someday I can be half the man you've become."" So many of us felt the same way as we watched his video for ""Clouds"" -- grateful for having had him walk among us, albeit for a short time, as he sang: ""And maybe someday I'll see you again. We'll float up in the clouds and we'll never see the end ...""","Zach Sobiech was diagnosed at 14 with osteosarcoma, a bone cancer .

"London (CNN) -- A Dutchman has built a replica of Noah's Ark to biblical proportions, following a dream his homeland would be flooded. Johan Huibers, a wealthy businessman, used the ancient measurement of the cubit -- the length of a man's arm from elbow to fingertips -- to build the vessel to the dimensions specified in the book of Genesis. The finished craft -- which has just been opened to the public on the Merwede River in the Dutch town of Dordrecht -- is 300 cubits long (about 450 feet or 137 meters), 50 cubits wide (about 70 feet or 21 meters), and 30 cubits high (about 45 feet or 14 meters). Floods force evacuations in Costa Rica . Huibers has filled his ark, which will operate as a ""Bible museum,"" with life-sized plastic animals and an aviary of live birds to give visitors more to interact with. ""We want to tell people about God,"" Huibers told AFP. ""We wanted to build something that can help explain the Bible in real terms."" It is not Huibers' first ark. He completed his first, a half-scale replica of Noah's Ark, in 2004, and used it to take tourists on canal trips, before beginning work on a full-scale version in 2008. The origin of the project stems from a dream Huibers said he had in 1992, in which the low-lying Netherlands was flooded by the North Sea. More damage expected after floods in North Korea kill dozens . ""The next day I bought a book about Noah's Ark. That night while sitting on the couch with my kids, I looked at it and said: 'It's what we're going to do,'"" he told AFP. ""I have always been a dreamer."" He resolved to build the ark, to inspire children with the biblical story of how Noah and the inhabitants of his Ark survived the flood that, according to Old Testament, washed the world clean of sin. Despite his best efforts, it was impossible to adhere entirely to the biblical description of the Ark. Genesis describes Noah's boat as made of ""gopher wood,"" but experts disagree over what this is. Instead, Huibers and his team built the boat by welding together the metal hulls of 25 barges into a single frame, which was then covered with Scandinavian pine. Weighing about 3,000 tons, the boat contains sleeping quarters, a theater, restaurant and conference facilities to seat 1,500 people. Huibers initially wanted to sail his ark to London for the Olympics to share his message with sports fans. But he was forced to abandon his plan to sail across the North Sea after authorities raised safety issues.

"(CNN) -- The secret to traveling in Jordan is to sit back and let your expectations be defied. Expect the unexpected in a country that offers glorious contradictions for the traveler to experience. The Jordanian state, for example, is less than a century old, but its history is ancient. The country contains the sandstone city of Petra, built and abandoned by the Nabateans and lost for a millennium after that, alongside Roman ruins, crusader castles, and mountains where prophets lived and listened. The Jordanian summer is long, hot, and dry, but it is still possible to swim and climb through the country's river canyons throughout. The winters are freezing, but thermal waterfalls offer relief. The Red Sea at Aqaba offers exceptional marine life, but no fish or plants can withstand the intense salinity of the Dead Sea, which allows the visitor to read a book whilst floating, even if the water itself is hundreds of meters below sea level. If the Fertile Crescent of the north gave Jordan its life, then the deserts of the south, home of the southern Bedouin nomads, gave Jordan its soul. I tried to learn a little about the Jordanians by traveling across the southern desert, from Wadi Rum to Aqaba by camel. I learned a lot about myself along the way. Ships of the desert . Camels may have an image problem, but they're not unreliable. True, they love to eat, and will eat almost anything, including bananas. Driving a camel is less an exercise of steering than of prompting the animal from one shrub to another. But any creature which, at the age of four, possesses the strength and endurance to cross one of the harshest places on Earth with a man and his supplies on its back, whilst drinking only twice in five days and eating nothing but thorns, does not deserve the label of unreliable. More: Couch surfing a cave in southern Jordan . The sensation of riding a camel is at once irregular and predictable, much like sailing in a small boat. Maybe that's one of the reasons why they've long been called ships of the desert. The view from the animal is astonishing, totally panoramic and unobstructed. And what a view it is that Wadi Rum offers. ""Vast, echoing, and God-like"" These words were used by Lawrence of Arabia to describe Wadi Rum, as he traveled the same route as us almost a century ago. By road, and by car, the 40-mile journey from Wadi Rum to Aqaba can be done in less than an hour. By camel, and through the extended isolation of the desert, a comfortable journey will take five days and four nights. That pace will allow you to see the sites of Wadi Rum, and explore this imposing place. The red sands stretch like seas between mountains of crimson sandstone. The rock monoliths have been sculpted by nature to resemble the drippings of candle wax on a monumental scale. Perspective becomes confused in Wadi Rum. The elements contort, and move in eerie ways. The wind comes from nowhere, blows strongly for a few seconds, and then disappears for hours. Bright blue birds leaped and darted around our camels before, just as suddenly, they disappeared. There is endless space in the desert, but time is something that you bring with you, like mineral water or tinned sardines. It is as though Rum has always been that way, and always will be. There is the movement of the sun, and the interplay of light and shadow, and that defines your waking hours. At night the campfire flickers and the moon drifts, and you are dazzled by the glitter of innumerable stars. The rocks retain the sun's warmth for hours after it sets, and will lend it to you as you sleep against them. There is silence and there is peace. If you go . Wadi Rum is four and a half hours drive from Amman, the Jordanian capital, by rental car. The national coach company, JETT, does not travel directly to Wadi Rum, but there are services to Petra (where buses cover the one hour connection to Rum) and to Aqaba (which is 40 minutes by taxi from Wadi Rum). More: The cave dwellers of Petra . The Wadi is not a single valley (as the Arabic word suggests) but rather a vast area of protected desert in which the Bedouin have established numerous government-approved camps. Always book a camp by email or phone, and try contacting several, before arriving at Wadi Rum. This allows you to secure the best price, and know what to expect. More: 'Inside the Middle East' heads to Jordan . Most camps offer a similar service of tent or under-the-stars accommodation, meals cooked in the Bedouin style, and various desert activities. A night in the desert and a day of activities can cost you anything from around $30 per person upwards, depending on the degree of comfort you seek and whether you prefer a private or large group journey. Prices can always be haggled, and are listed on the websites of tour companies along with the activities that they offer (see below). Wadi Rum is an outdoor experience, so don't expect any hotels. A five-day camel trip is a more complex and unusual endeavor, so prices will always be negotiated and you should try several companies. I received quotes that varied from $80 to around $110 per person per day for a trip of two people. This includes everything from guides, camels, food, water, and bedding, which is brought to you each day by a jeep. I traveled with Sabbah Ali (sabbahrum@yahoo.com) who offered fantastic quality and service. He is affiliated with Jordan Tracks. Other larger agencies are Bedouin Roads and Rum Guides. When to go . Like the rest of Jordan, temperatures in Wadi Rum are very cold in the winter months and very hot in the summer, making the best time to visit during the Spring (late March to early June) and Autumn (late September to early November). What to take . Even during Spring and Autumn there is a difference between day and night time temperatures that makes it wise to pack for heat, but prepare for cold. Bring some light thermals and a sturdy jacket, as these are great for sitting around a campfire then sleeping under the stars. Comfortable clothing is fine for riding a camel, and if you don't buy the red and white Jordanian head scarf, or keffiyeh, then your hosts may be able to provide one, as they serve well against all conditions and are the Bedouin item of choice. Walking boots are a must for Wadi Rum if you intend to hike or climb, and for camel riding it is advisable to wear socks to the knee, and tight underwear under a loose underwear layer to prevent any rubbing of your skin. Sun cream must be worn, even under thin clothes. Sensitive electronics may deal badly with the sand and climate of Rum, so be careful. If you want to bring a book then bring a torch too, because there's no electricity in the middle of the desert, but you may prefer to watch the stars and take a well-earned sleep instead.","Wadi Rum is a vast area of protected desert in southern Jordan .

OP to RS: I know. It was just when you got back from tropica you made it sound like you had only smoked weed once and then last night that came out. I don't know how many times you took or if you took other things or what you did when you were on them . RS to OP: I'm sorry if it upset you it wasn't my intention . OP to RS: I do appreciate it. could never be with someone that was . RS to OP: Me neither . RS to OP: It's like I see rabbit things in your house and when we go places you take pics of them everywhere. For me I'm thinking who do you have that connection with? And the same things will play on your mind. At the end of the day this is now not then . RS to OP: I wasn't a stripper or a ho . RS to OP: I certainly have never been a prude and I've had fun but all innocent and without harmful repercussions. January 27, 2013: . RS to OP: I'm not 100% sure why I'm sitting down to type you a message first but perhaps it says a lot about what's going on here. Today was one of my best friend's engagements and I wanted to stay longer I was enjoying myself but it's over now. You have picked on me incessantly since you got back from CT (Cape Town) and I understand that you are sick but it's nasty. Yesterday wasn't nice for either of us but we managed to pull through and communicate well enough to show our care for each other is greater than the drama that attacked us. I was not flirting with anyone today. I feel sick that you suggested that and that you made a scene at the table and made us leave early. I'm terribly disappointed in how the day ended and how you left me. We are living in a double standard relationship where you can be mad about how I deal with stuff when you are very quick to act cold and offish when you're unhappy. Every 5 seconds I hear how you dated another chick. You really have dated a lot of people yet you get upset if I mention ONE funny story with a long term boyfriend. I do everything to make you happy and to not say anything to rock the boat with u. You do everything to throw tantrums in front of people. I have been upset by you for 2 days now. I'm so upset I left Darren's party early. SO upset. I can't get that day back. I'm scared of you sometimes and how u snap at me and of how you will react to me. You make me happy 90% of the time and I think we are amazing together but I am not some other bitch you may know trying to kill your vibe. I am the girl who let go with u even when I was scared out of my mind to. I'm the girl who fell in love with u and wanted to tell u this weekend. But I'm also the girl that gets sidestepped when you are in a s**t mood. When I feel you think u have me so why try anymore. I get snapped at and told my accents and voices are annoying. I touch your neck to show u I care and you tell me to stop. Stop chewing gum. Do this don't do that. You don't want to hear stuff cut me off. Your endorsements your reputation your impression of someone innocent blown out of proportion and f***ed up a special day for me. I'm sorry if you truly felt I was hitting on my friend Sams husband and I'm sorry that u think that little of me. From the outside I think it looks like we are a struggle and maybe that's what we are. I just want to love and be loved. Be happy and make someone SO happy. Maybe we can't do that for each other. Cos right now I know u aren't happy and I am certainly very unhappy and sad. OP to RS: Please let me know when I can call you . RS to OP: I'm here . OP to RS: I want to talk to you. I want to sort this out. I don't want to have anything less than amazing for you and I. I am sorry for the things I say without thinking and for taking offense to some of your actions. The fact that I'm tired and sick isn't an excuse. I was upset that you just left me after we got food to go talk to a guy and I was standing right behind you watching you touch his arm and ignore me. And when I spoke up you introduced me which you could've done but when I left you just kept on chatting to him when clearly I was upset. I asked Martin to put on that Kendrick Lamar album in the car and don't know it. Granted that it was a s**t song but you should've just lent forward and whispered in my ear to change it seeing as I had to drive to pick up your friend. I was 30 minutes late and I know you don't like it when I drive fast but then you could've asked Gina to drive herself so that we wouldn't have to. When we left I was starving the only good I had had was a tiny wrap and everyone was leaving for lunch. I'm sorry I wanted to go but I was hungry and upset and although you knew it, it wasn't like you came to chat to me when I left the table. I was upset when I left you cos I thought you were coming to me. I'm sorry I asked you to stop tapping my neck yesterday, I know you were just trying to show me love. I had a mad headache and should've just spoken to you softly. In sorry for asking you not to put on an accent last night pretty much the same and didn't have the energy. February 8, 2013 . RS to OP: I like to believe that I made you proud when I attend these kind of functions with you. I present myself well and can converse with others while you are off busy chatting to fans and friends. I also knew people there tonight and whilst you were having one or two pics taken I was saying goodbye to the people in my industry and Fitz wanted a photo with me. I was just being cordial by saying goodbye whilst you were busy. I completely understood your desperation to leave and thought I would be helping you by getting to the exit before you because I can't rush on the heels I was wearing. I thought it would make a difference in us getting out without you getting harassed anymore. I didn't think you would criticize me for doing that especially not so loudly so that others could hear. I might joke around and be all Tom boyish at times but I regard myself as a lady and I didn't feel like one tonight after the way you treated me when we left. I'm a person too and I appreciate that you invited me out tonight and I realize that you get harassed but I am trying my best to make you happy and I feel as though you sometimes never are, no matter the effort I put in.

"(CNN) -- Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity, venerated by Christians as the birthplace of Jesus, could become the first World Heritage site in the Palestinian Territories, following a UNESCO meeting later this month. The nomination, which includes the church and surrounding route taken by religious pilgrims, is the Palestinians' first bid for inclusion on the prestigious list of sites deemed as holding ""outstanding universal value"" as part of the world's shared heritage. It comes after Palestinian membership to UNESCO, the United Nations' heritage body, was granted in October 2011, when UNESCO's general assembly voted by 107-14 to accept the Palestinians. The vote proved controversial with the United States, which holds the view that a peace deal must be reached with Israel before the Palestinian Territories can be granted full membership of international organizations. The U.S. and Israel's subsequent funding cut to the body saw UNESCO lose more than a fifth of its revenues. Bethlehem, situated in the West Bank, about eight kilometers south of Jerusalem, is considered the Palestinian Territories' top visitor destination partly due to the religious significance of the church. One of the oldest surviving Christian churches in the world, it drew 2 million visitors last year, according to Nada Atrash, an architect and head of the research and training unit at Bethlehem's Center for Cultural Heritage Preservation, which has been lobbying for the site's inscription as a World Heritage destination. She said the center considered Bethlehem's inclusion on the list ""as a Palestinian dream, and as a reward of 11 years of work in the field of preserving the cultural and natural heritage in Palestine."" See also: Book festival finally allowed into Gaza . Visitor numbers have hit record highs in recent years, but, according to a report into developing tourism in the town, Bethlehem has yet to properly capitalize on its potential. The majority of the visitors were day trippers on short visits, meaning the full economic benefits of tourism did not flow into the town. Atrash said it was hoped that gaining World Heritage status would help efforts to boost Bethlehem's appeal as a destination and keep visitors in the town for longer than a visit to the church. ""We are mainly seeking to extend the stay of the visitors, who usually drop (in) to Bethlehem for few hours to visit the church and leave without visiting the town,"" she said. ""We hope that this inscription would contribute to both the promotion of the site and its protection."" The condition of the church, which has suffered extensive earthquake damage in its history, has been of concern. One of the issues is that responsibility for its administration is shared between three religious authorities -- the Greek Orthodox, Armenian and Roman Catholic churches. On occasion, tensions between the groups have spilled over into violence; in December, about 100 Greek Orthodox and Armenian clerics fought with brooms when a tussle broke out while cleaning the church. One of Christianity's most holy places, the site's focal point is the Grotto of the Nativity, a rectangular cavern beneath the church that has been considered the site of Christ's birth since at least the 2nd century. A 14-pointed silver star set into the marble floor marks the precise spot where Jesus is said to have been born. In the 4th century, Emperor Constantine founded a church on the site, which was destroyed in the year 529, only to be replaced by larger structures, which form the basis of the church today. UNESCO's World Heritage Committee will consider the Church of the Nativity among 36 sites nominated for inclusion on the list at its next meeting, to be held from June 24 to July 6, in St Petersburg, Russia. UNESCO spokeswoman Susan Williams said it was not possible to predict the outcome of the meeting, where the committee would make its decisions ""based on the information that is provided by the expert bodies, and the different presentations that are made."" ""If the committee approves, it it's a done deal,"" she said. For the first time in its 40-year history, members of the public and the media will be able to follow the debates of the Committee through live streaming on the internet.

"Union City, Oklahoma (CNN) -- David Stottlemyre was inside an oil field repair shop in El Reno, Oklahoma, when he saw a tornado ""looking at us dead in the eye."" The lifelong Oklahoman said he and two co-workers stayed inside as the building took a direct hit; the roof collapsed and the structure blew apart. Though the three survived unscathed, ""We're all pretty shook up,"" the oil field mechanic told CNN. ""Surreal, really no other way to explain it."" Friday evening's twisters killed at least nine people, two of them children, and injured scores more in Oklahoma, the office of the city's medical examiner said. Five victims had not been identified. Canadian County Undersheriff Chris West said the seven fatalities in his county were inside vehicles. Oklahoma City-area hospitals treated 104 people for injuries related to the storm, the state health department said. Eleven were still being treated as of 5:15 p.m. (6:15 p.m. ET), hospital officials said. A National Weather Service survey team found damage indicating an EF3 tornado had struck near El Reno, 25 miles west of Oklahoma City. EF3s pack gusts of 136 to 165 mph. The strongest tornado is an EF5. It measured peak rainfall of 7.9 inches 45 miles east of Oklahoma City, outside Meeker. How to help . The storms came less than two weeks after a monstrous EF5 tornado turned parts of Moore, a suburb of Oklahoma City, into rubble. ""There's just no rest,"" city spokeswoman Kristy Yager said. In all, 17 tornadoes were reported in the Midwest. The number was expected to change when officials conduct storm surveys, said Kurt Van Speybroeck, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. At one point, some 200,000 customers were without power in the Midwest, most of them in Missouri and Oklahoma, though that number fell significantly as Saturday wore on. Three Oklahoma City-area medical facilities were running on generators Saturday, the health department said. Tornado damage 'sobering' While twisters damaged houses in Missouri and Illinois, Oklahoma City and its surrounding areas, including El Reno and Union City, were hit hardest. The storm system swatted down power lines and uprooted trees, flicked big rigs on their sides and yanked off part of the terminal roof at Oklahoma City's Will Rogers World Airport, where some 1,500 area residents had taken shelter in a tunnel. Get up to speed on the massive storm . ""We're just grateful we were able to get everybody down there,"" airport spokeswoman Karen Carney told CNN. A power outage and debris on the runway -- caused by 80 mph winds, not a tornado -- at one point forced the airport to cancel all flights. Service resumed Saturday, when the lights flickered back on to reveal water damage to the walls, counters and floors, Carney said. One twister tore open Kris Meritt's parents' brick house like a carton, sucking out its contents and tossing most of them onto the lawn. It spared the walls and part of the roof, then moved on to raze the house next door. The parents returned to survey the damage, but rushed off when another tornado was headed their way. ""It's a sobering thing to think about life, and to see all your memories just tossed about,"" Merritt said. ""Everything from your childhood on up."" Though Friday's tornadoes were not as strong as the EF5 twister that killed 24 people on May 20, fear drove some people into their cars to flee, ignoring warnings not to drive. Officials described parts of Interstates 35 and 40 near Oklahoma City as ""a parking lot."" ""People were actually driving southbound in the northbound lanes to try and get out of the way,"" said storm chaser Dave Holder. J. Marshall Shepherd, president of the American Meteorological Society and director of the Atmospheric Sciences Program at the University of Georgia, said Saturday that should not have occurred. ""We knew well in advance these storms were going to be quite dangerous,"" he told CNN. ""The weather service was crystal clear, to stay off the roads after 4 p.m. yesterday."" In Moore, the storms affected residents still picking up the pieces from the previous disaster. ""There's damage everywhere,"" Mayor Glenn Lewis told CNN's Anderson Cooper. 'Overwhelmed' by rains, flooding . Most of Lewis' already devastated town blacked out Friday night, with flooded streets adding to the headaches. ""I can't even get home to see if my house is OK,"" the Moore mayor said Friday night. Eight to 11 inches of rain hosed Oklahoma City, drenching the area, Yager said. Get up to speed on the massive storm . An inch of water pooled on the first floor of City Hall, and apartments in low-lying areas of town were hit harder. ""We've seen widespread flooding throughout the entire 621 square miles,"" she said. Flooding stranded some motorists. ""We saw flooding in areas that we don't see flooding,"" said police Lt. Jay Barnett. ""We were overwhelmed."" 3 die by drowning in Missouri . The impact of the severe weather spread beyond Oklahoma. A powerful storm caused major damage to a gymnasium of Gillespie High School in southwestern Illinois, with bricks piled up from what had been the gym's front now piled up on the school's lawn, Gillespie Mayor John Hicks said. Seven to 10 homes were destroyed, and more than 30 others suffered damage, in the storm. Thankfully, though, no one died or was significantly injured in the town of about 3,400 people. Gillespie's mayor said things might have been much different had the storm struck next week, when hundreds were set to gather not far from the high school for a celebration called Black Diamond Days. In Missouri, Gov. Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency, as the storm front moved into his state stripping sidings and roofs off homes and causing deadly flooding. A tornado in St. Charles and St. Louis counties left a path ""over 10 miles of significant damage ... that caused dozens and dozens of houses to be literally blown up,"" the governor told CNN affiliate KSDK on Saturday. Aerial video from CNN affiliate KMOV showed the second floors of several homes ripped apart, with houses to the front and behind still standing. In one home, a man walked across the exposed second floor, walls and roof gone, at one point picking up what appeared to be a picture as he negotiated debris on all sides. Nearby, shirts still hung on one side of what used to be a closet. Also damaged was the 10,000-seat Family Arena in St. Charles, county spokesman Colene McEntee told CNN. The damage led three high schools in the Francis Howell school district to cancel graduation ceremonies that had been scheduled for Saturday, KSDK reported. No one was killed in that tornado, but three people drowned in the state, according to Nixon. Problems with high waters aren't necessarily going away, especially in the southern part of the state. ""Waters are rising, floods are still occurring, and we're asking people to be very safe,"" the governor said Saturday afternoon. Moore re-traumatized . In Moore, the howls of civil defense sirens sent storm-weary residents scrambling again. Candace Looper retreated to her windowless laundry room with her cat and stacked couch pillows on top of her. ""I've been praying, and I've been singing 'The Lord's Prayer' and singing 'Amazing Grace,' so I'm OK,"" she told CNN. LaDonna Cobb and her husband, Steve, were with their children at their school on May 20 when a tornado demolished the building. A photograph of Steve Cobb carrying one of their daughters with his wife looking to him with blood on her face emerged as a symbol of Moore's suffering and resilience. Friday's tornadoes drove them into a shelter and put fear into their hearts again. ""We're terrified,"" Cobb told CNN's Piers Morgan. The second tornado was particular unsettling for their children. ""They were not handling it very well. They were pretty upset,"" Cobb said. Once it passed, Lewis, the city mayor, rode around town in his pickup. ""This is unbelievable that it could possibly even hit again,"" he said. ""We just started picking up (debris) two days ago."" CNN's Nick Valencia reported from El Reno, Oklahoma; George Howell reported from Union City, Oklahoma; and Holly Yan and Ben Brumfield from Atlanta.

"(CNN) -- The Aral Sea was once the world's fourth-largest lake. Now much of it is a vast toxic desert straddling the borders of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, two former Soviet states in central Asia. In recently released images, NASA's Earth Observatory shows the extent of the lake's recession over the past 14 years. The damage reached its peak this year, when the eastern lobe of the South Aral Sea -- which actually was the center of the original lake -- dried up completely. Until the 1960s, the Aral Sea was fed by two rivers, the Amu Darya and Syr Darya, which brought snowmelt from mountains to the southeast, and local rainfall. But in the 1960s the Soviet Union diverted water from the two rivers into canals to supply agriculture in the region. With the loss of water, the lake began to recede and its salinity levels began to rise. Fertilizers and chemical runoff contaminated the lake bed. As the lakebed became exposed, winds blew the contaminated soil onto the surrounding croplands, meaning even more water was needed to make the land suitable for agriculture, according to an Earth Observatory release. The falling water levels changed the local climate, too. Without the lake water to moderate temperatures, winters became colder and summers hotter, the Earth Observatory said.","Eastern lobe of what is now known as the South Aral Sea has dried up completely .

"(CNN) -- In the latest round of Rand Paul vs. Chris Christie, the Kentucky senator tweaked his potential 2016 rival Sunday for his recent outburst in which the New Jersey governor told a heckler to ""sit down and shut up."" After watching a clip of the confrontation on CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" Paul smirked and suggested ""this sort of bully demeanor"" might work well in some places -- but not in all. ""I can't imagine that -- I grew up in the South. And we're 'yes, ma'am' and 'no, sir' and a little bit more polite,"" the Kentucky Republican said. Rand Paul on Chris Christie in one word: 'Bridges' ""I think people want someone to be bold. And there was a time when I thought, you know what? When he stands up and he says things boldly, that's kind of good. He's not taking any flak,"" he continued. ""But there can be too much of that, too."" The first-term senator and Christie have butted heads through the media for more than a year over their ideological differences. Rand Paul 'sucks' air out of GOP conversation . They're both considered potential top contenders for the GOP presidential nomination, as they've aggressively traveled across the country this year, campaigning for 2014 candidates and laying the groundwork for possible White House bids. They've each traveled to more than 30 states. On some issues, Paul and Christie sound a lot alike . ""We live in a world where we have so much cacophony of voices on TV sometimes of yelling back and forth,"" Paul said. ""And I think there's a resurgence of people who want a little more civility and discourse."" Christie defended his reaction to the heckler, telling reporters in New Mexico that it's simply his style to confront people who are being rude. As he put it, the heated exchange was ""just another day at the ranch -- Rancho Christie."" Christie to heckler: 'Sit down and shut up' Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, who clashed with Christie over the Republican Governors Association chairmanship, also criticized the governor for his tone. ""I did say after the last presidential election, if we want voters to like us, we have got to like them first,"" Jindal, another possible 2016 Republican, said Friday on Fox News.

"(CNN) -- Following a big night for Republican gubernatorial candidates, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie took a victory lap Wednesday morning with interviews on all five major news networks, where he brushed off questions about 2016 and defended his recent shout-down of a heckler. Here's a few messages he tried to push: . 1. He says he hasn't made a decision on running for president: The political calendar is now focused on the next presidential election, but Christie appeared no more closer to making a decision on 2016. Pressed by CNN's Chris Cuomo on ""New Day"" to elaborate on his own thought process and the public pressure he's facing to run, Christie didn't budge. ""I'll make this decision based on my own time table and not on anybody else's,"" he said. As chairman of the Republican Governors Association, Christie helped raise more than $100 million in the past year and Republicans gained multiple governorships Tuesday night, while still others have yet to be called. Asked how he can say no to 2016 after having a successful year, Christie said: ""I don't know that you'd say 'no'."" ""But I haven't said yes,"" he continued. ""That's a big difference."" On ABC's ""Good Morning America,"" Christie said the past year of traveling gave him and his family a better feel for what a national campaign would be like that. But is it fair to say he's closer to a 2016 run, asked George Robert Stephanopoulos. ""No, not fair to say,"" Christie said. ""It's fair to say that what I'm looking for is a nap."" 2. He doesn't regret yelling at the heckler: Even some Republicans â€” including Mitt Romney, Bobby Jindal and Rand Paul â€” argued Christie's sharp reaction to a heckler last week wasn't the best way to handle the situation. But Christie said he has no regrets. Asked on CNN and NBC whether he thinks he'll be able to control his Jersey temperament if he runs for president, Christie took issue with the premise. ""Why would anybody think that what I did last night wasn't controlled, first off? Why would they think that I didn't do exactly what I wanted to do?"" he said on CNN. Christie said on almost all the shows that he wouldn't do it differently if he's interrupted like that again and thinks his style will play just fine in other states . ""I'm going to be myself. If I decide to run for something and that's not good enough, then that's not good enough,"" he said. I'm not going to change who I am--not for anybody"" Asked on NBC whether he might at least try to ""hide"" that part of his personality, Christie candidly replied, ""There's no hope for that."" 3. He says he's not trying to take credit for Tuesday night's success: Christie was strategic in trying to keep the candidates in the spotlight Wednesday morning, saying on NBC that ""the candidates deserve the credit -- it's always about the candidates."" When Gayle King on CBS asked if his morning show appearances could be called a victory lap, Christie said with a straight face: ""You can certainly call it an acknowledgment of a lot of hard work by a lot of great governors."" The sweetest personal victory for him, he said on CBS, was Gov. Paul LePage's re-election victory in Maine. But he added that Republican pickups in blue states like Massachusetts, Maryland and Illinois were also great. ""I love that map this morning,"" he said on Fox News. ""It looks absolutely fabulous."" He didn't hesitate to take some shots at Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, who's openly considering a 2016 presidential run, saying the GOP's win in Maryland is a rejection of O'Malley's policies of ""high taxes and big spending."" ""Even for Maryland it got to be too much,"" Christie said on CBS. 4. Tuesday night was also a message to Obama: Christie said on Fox News that Tuesday night's results were a ""a reflection of the president's lack of leadership."" ""The biggest emotion I saw (when traveling) was anxiety,"" he said. ""We used to control events, now events control us."" He argued that ""the president needs to step up and finally lead and work and compromise"" with the new Republican majority in Congress.","Chris Christie appeared on five morning news shows on Wednesday .

"Toney, Alabama (CNN) -- She says she didn't want to do it, but was convinced by a teacher's aide to act as bait to catch an accused sexual predator. What happened next was horrific: The then-14-year-old girl says she was sodomized by a fellow student in a school bathroom. Now 19, she is telling her story publicly for the very first time. ""I just felt like I was set up by the teachers. They gave me a word that they couldn't keep,"" said the woman, who asked CNN to call her ""Jaden."" According to court records, a 16-year-old student approached Jaden in the hallway of Sparkman Middle School in Toney, Alabama, on January 22, 2010, and asked her to meet him in a bathroom for sex. It was not the first time the boy had propositioned her, said Jaden, who was enrolled in the school's special education program. Usually, she just ignored him. But, on that day, Jaden told a friend, who suggested she tell a teacher's aide about what was happening. That aide, June Ann Simpson, knew of other girls who the boy had tried to lure into a bathroom for sex, according to a 2010 federal lawsuit filed by Jaden's father against Madison County Schools and officials. Simpson, in turn, told the school's principal, Ronnie Blair, about the allegations. According to a 2012 deposition, Blair told Simpson the boy would have to be proven guilty to be punished. In response, Simpson crafted a plan to prove the allegations, using Jaden as bait. The idea was to have the girl agree to meet the boy in a bathroom. Simpson would watch surveillance video, and teachers would intervene before anything happened. ""I told her no. I didn't want to do it,"" Jaden told CNN. She acquiesced later that day. ""I just wanted it to stop,"" Jaden said about the alleged harassment. 'He just gets away with it' Key questions in her case center around who knew what and when. Jaden and Simpson claim they then went to the office of vice-principal Jeanne Dunaway. However, Simpson says when she told Dunaway about the plan, Dunaway did not respond. During a deposition, Dunaway denied the conversation happened. Jaden says she then left Dunaway's office and found the boy in the hallway to tell him they could ""do it."" Simpson stayed behind to watch surveillance monitors, hoping to catch the two walk into the bathroom. She never did. According to Jaden's written statement after the incident, the boy made a last-minute change. Instead of meeting in the boys' bathroom on the special needs students' corridor, the boy allegedly told the girl to meet him in the sixth grade boys' bathroom, in another part of the school. Once there, Jaden says she tried to stall the boy, hoping a teacher would rush in. She told him she didn't want to have sex, and she tried blocking him, according to her 2012 deposition. Nothing worked. Jaden says the boy sodomized her. ""I thought they were going to do what they said they were going to do -- and be there and stop him -- just get him in trouble,"" Jaden told CNN. The alleged attacker was never charged and the case was never presented to a grand jury, according to Madison County District Attorney Robert Broussard. The incident was characterized as ""inappropriate (sic) touching a girl in boys bathroom"" according to school disciplinary records. The boy was suspended from school for five days and sent to an alternative school for a short time. The alleged attack was at least the 13th incident of sexual or violent misconduct in the boy's file, all within two academic years. While at the alternative school, the boy was suspended for sharing pornographic images on a cell phone. He was eventually allowed to return to Sparkman Middle School while Jaden was still enrolled as a student. ""He just gets away with it, I guess,"" she told CNN. June Ann Simpson resigned shortly after the incident. ""My client has gone from being a teacher's aide to being a scapegoat,"" Simpson's attorney, McGriff Belser III told CNN. Dunaway is now the principal at nearby Madison County Elementary School. 'Hard for me to have good days' In 2013, a district court judge allowed the father's claims of state violations, including negligence, against Simpson and Dunaway. The judge tossed out the federal claims -- that the school district violated Title IX and that Simpson and school administrators deprived the girl of her civil rights. Title IX is a federal law aimed at ending sexual discrimination in education. In part, it dictates how schools that receive federal funds must respond to claims of sexual harassment. Both sides have appealed. ""(Judge T. Michael Putnam) found the board of education's policies were proper. He found that the school administrators took appropriate action and complied completely with federal law as soon as they were notified of this unfortunate incident,"" attorney Mark Boardman told reporters last month. Boardman's firm represents Madison County Schools and the administrators named in the 2010 lawsuit. The firm has not responded to CNN's numerous calls for an interview. Also in September, the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division submitted a 126-page strident amicus brief to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, disagreeing with the district judge's order. The brief, submitted jointly with the U.S. Department of Education, argues the school, in its capacity as a recipient of federal funds is ""liable for (its) deliberate indifference to known acts of peer sexual harassment."" ""If Title IX imposes any responsibility on school officials to prevent sexual harassment, it surely requires a response when they learn, as here, that a 14-year-old special needs student is about to be used as bait to catch a 16-year-old student with an extensive history of sexual and violent misconduct,"" federal attorneys write in the brief. On the same day the federal brief was submitted, the Women's Law Project, joined by 32 national and local organizations, submitted a joint brief supporting the family's lawsuit. The National Women's Law Center and the family's attorney, Eric Artrip, have also submitted a joint brief to the Eleventh Circuit. ""It means a lot. It says that people actually care about what happens,"" Jaden told CNN . Months after the incident, the teen transferred to a school district out of state, but eventually dropped out of school before graduating. Jaden says she continues to struggle. ""It's hard for me to have good days,"" she told CNN. ""I have days to where I just want to sit there by myself. I get angry faster, and I get insecure."" Asked what might help her, she stressed the importance of justice and closure. ""By actually having our day in court, and letting everything be known, so that it won't happen again,"" Jaden said. CNN's Stephanie Gallman and Dana Ford contributed to this report from Atlanta.","The woman, now 19, talks about her story publicly for the first time .

"Kangerlussuaq, Greenland (CNN) -- For hundreds of years the Arctic has fascinated explorers and scientists who wonder what treasures may lie under the massive ice plains that occupy much of the territory here. Adventurers from across the globe have been coming to Greenland for years to try and uncover what secrets lay beneath the massive ice shield here, which is more than twice the size of the U.S. state of Texas. It turns out that many of the riches are not hidden under the frozen and compressed snow layers, but right in them. Scientists gather a wealth of information from the ice in Greenland. It gives of them details on climates dating back more than 100,000 years, including temperatures, precipitation, cloud cover, and special occurrences such as volcanic eruptions that leave traces of ash. ""If we can understand the past, then it will help us better predict the future of climate change,"" says Trevor Popp, a climatologist from the University of Copenhagen. ""And Greenland is the best place to experience the processes first hand. Someone once told me this is where the rubber meets the road when it comes to studying climate change."" Read: Chasing down the world's vanishing glaciers . An abundance of research missions have been launched to the Arctic ice shield. One of the most respected organizations working here is Germany's Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research. The AWI as it is known as has now given CNN the chance to participate in a mission to the Arctic, featuring the institute's most advanced new research aircraft, Polar 6. ""It is a two-fold mission,"" Daniel Steinhage the geophysicist who headed the endeavor told us. ""On the one hand we will fly radar survey missions over the ice to penetrate the first hundred to two hundred meters. Then we will land in some of the places along our flight route to drill shallow ice cores for more exact results."" The mission's goal was to develop an improved method to map the upper layers of Greenland's Arctic ice, down to about 150 meters under the surface, in a bid to improve climate projection models that try to tell us how temperatures, rainfall and weather patterns on earth will evolve in the future. The research seems urgent after increases in severe weather like hurricanes have increasingly raised the question of how global ice melt contributes to these weather phenomena. Read: Greenland, Antarctica ice melt speeding up . Sepp Kippstuhl, a glaciologist at AWI says researchers are not sure how much humans contribute to climate change, but that industrialization and the emissions it creates surely have effects on climate. ""We turn on so many screws that something somewhere has to change, but we don't know what that change is or how severe it is. That is why we are trying to improve our climate modeling,"" says Kippstuhl. The AWI's mission to the Arctic will try and improve methods of gaining data on ice melt in the Arctic. After outfitting the Polar 6 research aircraft with antennas and state of the art computer systems for over a week, the team and the aircraft head to Kangerlussuaq in Greenland -- a former U.S. military base that is home to about 600 people and the largest airfield on the island. Polar 6 is a unique plane. The airframe comes from a DC-3 Dakota, a plane used by the U.S. and other militaries in World War II and the following years to transport goods. However, while Polar 6 might look like an old plane, it is outfitted with state of the art modern avionics and brand new engines, making it as reliable as any modern day aircraft. Read: Greenhouse gases reach new peak . The first part of the AWI's polar mission was conducting radar survey flights to the middle of Greenland's ice shield. After take off from Kangerlussuaq and a flight over some of the most majestic fjords in the world, Polar 6 reached the glaciers on the fringes of Greenland's inland ice. It took the aircraft another two hours to get to the radar survey area. The ice here is a lot like the salt flats in Nevada, there are no hills or valley, no landmarks whatsoever, making it extremely hard for the pilots to distinguish the clouds from the surface. ""The extremes that we operate in are really not something that can be taught,"" Polar 6's captain Erik Bengtsson, a Canadian, told us while navigating the ice plains. ""You need to just gain experience flying in these conditions and you always have to keep an eye on the weather because it changes so quickly out here."" Around three hours into our flight, Steinhage was finally able to boot his computers and start using the radar equipment. Read: Trying to agree a Kyoto 2.0, as the planet simmers . ""The radar penetrates about 150 to 200 meters into the ice,"" Steinhage said, while monitoring a variety of screens in the plane's hull. ""The useful data goes about 100 to 120 meters deep, after that it is very distorted, but the data from those depths is very useful."" The data gathered by Polar 6's radars is part of the puzzle to try and map conditions in the top layers of the arctic ice shield. The ice here consists of compressed snow that fell in Greenland in the past and was then pressed into layers as more and more precipitation came down over the years. The ice is layered much like tree rings. Each layer represents a certain point in time and gives clues to the climate conditions of that era. ""If we can understand the past and get data from the past, then we can enter that information into our computers and run it forward to try and predict how the climate will change in the future,"" Steinhage said. ""The problem we have is that every time we get new data there are also new questions as well. There are so many factors influencing the world's climate that it is very hard to predict how it will change in the future."" But each bit of information also delivers some answers to questions about the how our climate is evolving. Read: Drought-stressed trees face race to adapt . For the second part of the AWI's missions, the team loaded a heavy drill into Polar 6's hull and landed right in the middle of the ice shield on skis to drill ice cores. Delivering the drill with a plane is unique in itself, so far researchers would mostly use snow mobiles or other special vehicles to transport equipment to drill sites. A process that could take days, with Polar 6 only takes a few hours. Sepp Kipfstuhl is in charge of shallow ice core drilling at the AWI and brings more than 30 years of experience to the table. After a rough landing right on Greenland's inland ice, Kipfstuhl and his team set up their drill and begin working. The cores they pull out of the ice will have to be scientifically evaluated in a lab for months after the end of the mission, but with his experience Kipfstuhl immediately points to signs that point to very warm summers here in the Arctic in the past years. ""On the ice you will see melt layers,"" he says pointing to dark and very compressed layering in the ice. ""They are extremely prominent melt layers and guys who drilled here 30 years ago say they don't remember melt layers this prominent. The melt layers point to extremely warm summers here in the past years, where the ice surface melted and then froze again during the winter."" That preliminary evaluation is also backed by NASA data from its ice tracking satellite. The space agency recorded unprecedented surface ice melt in the Arctic this past summer with about 97% of Greenland's inland ice showing signs of thawing. In normal years, about 50% of the ice shield's thaws. This process is also clearly visible from the air as Polar 6 flies over Greenland. Clear blue meltwater ponds dot the landscape, growing larger under the Arctic summer's sun. Kipfstuhl and his team spent about seven hours drilling on the ice shield. All of the work happens at night because during the day the thawing is so bad that the ice surface becomes too slushy to operate a drill -- another sign that temperatures are rising. Like most scientists, Kipfstuhl is not willing to speculate how much humans are contributing to global warming. But he does say that humanity is taking a big risk. ""We are doing an experiment with our planet and we have no idea what the outcome will be, what the result will be. All we can do is try to predict it, but there are so many variables in our environment that it is very hard,"" he said. The debate on climate change is extremely politically charged and it is hard to get unbiased information. In a nutshell climate researchers will give the following facts. The earth is getting warmer. Temperatures have increased dramatically since the industrial revolution but it is still unclear how much humans are contributing to global warming because there have been warmer and colder climate cycles in the past. Warming temperatures and ice melt will lead to rising sea levels and may be contributing to more frequent and more intense severe weather on earth. There is very little certainty in today's climate research and missions like the one that the Alfred-Wegener-Institute conducted in Greenland constantly try to improve the available data to give a more accurate picture of what the future might hold on this planet we inhabit. Their predictions become a little more accurate with every expedition but every mission also brings up new sets of questions that will take decades to answer.","CNN correspondent joins scientists on mission to Greenland to understand how the vast ice sheet is changing .

"(CNN) -- Texas Democrats are calling for the resignation of a Republican elected county judge who warned this week that the nation could descend into civil war if President Barack Obama is re-elected. ""It's really up to Judge (Tom) Head to do the right thing and resign and stop embarrassing Lubbock County,"" said Kenny Ketner, who became the county Democratic Party's chief Monday. ""I wish we were getting worldwide attention for something better than a crazy county judge,"" Ketner told CNN. ""But what are you going to do?"" There is no recall process for Head's office in Texas, Ketner said. The county's Republican Party chief, Carl Tepper, accused the Democrats of ""opportunism"" and said he had called Head and left him a message offering ""moral support."" ""I don't agree with him, but everyone has their opinion,"" Tepper said. ""I can respectfully disagree with him and he can still be an elected official."" While Tepper said he had not heard from state Republican Party chiefs, the Texas Democratic Party did weigh in with a statement. ""This nonsense is what passes for mainstream in today's Republican Party,"" the statement said. ""It's not only ridiculous, it's dangerous. It's crystal clear that Judge Head should resign."" In remarks this week, Head called for a well-equipped force to battle the United Nations troops that he said Obama might bring in. The comments by Head, who oversees emergency planning efforts, were broadcast by CNN affiliate KJTV. He made similar remarks on radio station FOX Talk 950. Saying that as the county's emergency management coordinator he has to ""think about the very worst thing that can happen and prepare for that and hope and pray for the best,"" Head told radio host Jeff Klotzman that he believes ""in this political climate and financial climate, what is the very worst thing that could happen right now? Obama gets back in the White House. No. God forbid."" Why are tax hikes politically radioactive? Referring to unexplained ""executive orders"" and other documents that Obama and ""his minions have filed,"" Head said, ""regardless of whether the Republicans take over the Senate, which I hope they do, he is going to make the United States Congress and he's going to make the Constitution irrelevant. He's got his czars in place that don't answer to anybody."" Obama, Head said, will ""try to give the sovereignty of the United States away to the United Nations. What do you think the public's going to do when that happens? We are talking civil unrest, civil disobedience, possibly, possibly civil war. ... I'm not talking just talking riots here and there. I'm talking Lexington, Concord, take up arms, get rid of the dictator. OK, what do you think he is going to do when that happens? He is going to call in the U.N. troops, personnel carriers, tanks and whatever."" Head vowed to personally stand ""in front of their personnel carriers and say, 'You're not coming in here.' And I've asked the sheriff. I said, 'Are you going to back me on this?' And he said, 'Yeah, I'm going to back you.' Well, I don't want a bunch of rookies back there who have no training and little equipment. I want seasoned veteran people who are trained that have got equipment. And even then, you know we may have two or three hundred deputies facing maybe a thousand U.N. troops. We may have to call out the militia."" Opinion: Taxmageddon headed our way . Sheriff Kelly Rowe told KJTV there had been no conversation about such a civil war scenario. The two have discussed contingencies for emergency management, he said. The lone Democrat on the Lubbock County Commissioner's Court, Gilbert Flores, described Head with a colorful West Texas saying: ""He's a six-pack short of a full case of beer, if you know what I mean."" KJTV reported that the warning was linked to taxes. Head ""indicates a tax increase is needed to shore up law enforcement to protect us,"" the station reported, adding that a tax increase is under consideration that ""would largely benefit the district attorney and sheriff's offices. But the emphasis is more on salary competitiveness than doomsday scenarios."" Head made his controversial remarks Tuesday. On Wednesday at a county commissioner meeting, he emphasized that his remarks were about ""worst-case scenario in my opinion,"" and added, ""Do I think those are going to happen? Probably not."" Also Wednesday, he told the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal, ""I cannot divorce my theology and my philosophy from me, from my office, you know? I am pro-life, I am pro-gun rights, and if you're going to vote for me and say you don't believe in gun rights, you don't want me in office, so you won't vote for me."" Attorney Rod Hobson jokingly put up U.N. flags outside his Lubbock office, KJTV reported. ""When I saw the story I thought, once again, Lubbock is going to be the laughingstock of the entire nation,"" Hobson said. ""What makes it so sad is he is our elected county judge, who is in charge of a multimillion-dollar budget. That is scary. It's like the light's on, but no one is home. ... I'd just like to think he's off his meds."" But video from the Wednesday meeting showed at least one citizen supporting him. ""Judge Head, thank you, and God bless,"" the citizen said. Head did not respond to e-mail or phone calls to his office on Thursday. Both Ketner of the county Democratic Party and Tepper of the county Republican Party said they have received calls from people on both sides of the issue. While many callers to Ketner have asked if there is any way to boot him from office, some have said they support the judge, Ketner said. Tepper said Republicans are split over the issue. ""There's quite a divergent mix of views"" within the party, he said. ""Some people are very staunch defenders of Judge Head. And some people don't appreciate how he said what he said."" Democrats are pushing for members of the public to show up Monday to a county commission budget meeting. ""Normally, nobody shows up,"" Ketner said. But given the attention Head's remarks are getting, this meeting just might draw a crowd, he said. Follow the latest political coverage on the CNN Political Ticker .

"(CNN) -- What was, in retrospect, most heroic about Neil Alden Armstrong, who died Saturday at age 82, was the manner in which he shied away from the spoils and trappings of heroism itself. Being the first man on the moon, after all, would seem to place you on top of the world, providing a kind of lifetime pass to wherever you wanted to go -- and whatever you wanted to be. Thinking of running for office? Name the district, state or country and it's yours. Maybe you'd like to go into business. The line of people with dotted lines to sign stretches from here to infinity. And so do their wallets. Show biz? Hmmm -- that's a tough one. You and Bob Hope weren't exactly magic together on that USO tour. But, well, we can make something happen, right? This is America, after all, and you are the Greatest American Hero! Armstrong's one small step resonated for all mankind . But Armstrong, a native of Wapakoneta, Ohio, so steeped in flying that his idea of winding down was piloting gliders in his spare time, wanted exactly none of those options. Having his choice of any possible future after leaving NASA in 1971, he chose to go back to his home state and teach aerospace engineering at the University of Cincinnati. It was an unusual, but, by then, hardly surprising move by the laconic commander of Apollo 11, the July 1969 mission that fulfilled President John F. Kennedy's mandate for an American lunar landing within a decade. Before, during and after that epochal journey, Armstrong came across as something of an enigma to global media anxious to make him the brightest star on Earth. This was going to be tough. Rather than having the jaunty wit of a Wally Schirra, the affable magnetism of a John Glenn or the flinty swagger of a Chuck Yeager, Neil Armstrong came across as nothing more than the earnest, no-nonsense engineer he actually was. No artifice, no flash, no -- well, frankly, no star power to speak of. Within the fraternity of test pilots, however, Armstrong was among the brightest of stars. Before being chosen in 1962 as one of the ""Group II"" astronauts -- which included Apollo 13 commander James Lovell along with such legends as Frank Borman, Pete Conrad and John Young -- Armstrong was one of the elite pilots selected to fly the X-15 rocket plane up to five times the speed of sound and toward the edge of space. Remembering Neil Armstrong . And that no-nonsense demeanor served Armstrong well in his work. As command pilot of the March 1966 Gemini 8 mission, the first in which one spacecraft docked with another vehicle in orbit, Armstrong showed cool composure when a malfunctioning thruster caused his two-man spacecraft to tumble end over end. His decision-making may have prematurely ended the mission, but it saved his life, co-pilot David Scott's life, and possibly the whole American space program. And yet, all many people remembered about that flight was that its mishap pre-empted that night's broadcast of CBS's ""Lost in Space."" Armstrong's seemingly casual reaction to peril left his NASA colleagues in awe when, in May 1968, he picked exactly the right time to eject from a lunar landing simulator that had spun out of control. His only injury was a bitten tongue sustained after parachuting to safety. He was back at his office, working, that same afternoon. Few of these facts were widely known by the public when Armstrong, along with Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins, was picked for the lunar landing mission. All people knew about the astronaut who would turn out to be the first man on the moon was what they saw. And what they saw mystified them. In press conferences and interviews before the Apollo 11 flight, Armstrong spoke mostly in clipped, dry sentences, almost as if he were transmitting radio messages from a distance while still on Earth. Norman Mailer, assigned by Life magazine to cover the flight, found him in press conferences to be ""extraordinarily remote ... apparently in communion with some string in the universe others did not think to unravel."" Even those famous first words upon stepping off the Lunar Module -- ""That's one small step for man. One giant leap for mankind."" -- resounded to a waiting world as tentative, fragmented; almost as if they had to be pulled from Armstrong after a struggle. Yet over the span of 40-plus years, those eleven words have achieved iconic stature in no small way because of the unassuming manner in which they were uttered. Armstrong taught at Cincinnati for eight years before leaving in 1979, characteristically without explanation. He was hardly a recluse afterward, though he maintained a relatively low profile; lower, anyway, than you'd expect for the first man on the moon. He sat on boards of banks and corporations and served on various commissions, including the one investigating the 1986 Challenger disaster. (That panel included another space pioneer, Sally Ride, who died little more than a month ago.) Obituaries 2012: The lives they've lived . He was cautious about giving interviews and autographs, hawkish about the use of his name and of anything related to his Apollo 11 mission. While his fellow Apollo 11 moon-walker, Buzz Aldrin, seemed up for anything from ""Dancing With The Stars"" to ""Transformers 3"" (and he's been a wry and inspirational figure to have on the scene), Armstrong kept his distance from the media circus beyond authorizing a biography, ""First Man: The Life of Neil A. Armstrong,"" in 2005. If he raised his voice in public at all, it had only to do with space exploration and his growing sorrow over America's gradual withdrawal from taking the initiative in manned flight. Still, by his ninth decade on planet Earth, Armstrong seemed to be more relaxed in public and generally more visible than he used to be. If anything, his time hugging the corners of fame made him seem even more admirable as a man who refused to sell himself or his legacy out, no matter what temptations were available in a celebrity-crazed culture. For one spellbinding week 43 summers ago, Neil Armstrong did something that once seemed unimaginable. Since then, he lived his life in a way that now seems improbable. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gene Seymour.","Gene Seymour: Neil Armstrong was a star test pilot, cool and decisive under stress .

"(CNN) -- Add Iran's news agency to the long list of those hoodwinked by the satire of The Onion. Iran's semi-official Fars News Agency published a story Friday claiming that a Gallup poll found that rural white Americans prefer Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad over President Barack Obama. Such a poll would indeed be big news in Iran (and the United States) -- if it were true. But the source was The Onion, the publication that presents the outlandish as real news. Its serious tone fools many who are new to the lampoons. Onion yarns have tricked news outlets in the U.S. and overseas. Ahmadinejad: I'm quite popular . What sets Fars apart from others, however, is that the agency published the Onion story as if it were its own. Fars News Agency used the story verbatim, giving the same headline: ""Gallup Poll: Rural Whites Prefer Ahmadinejad To Obama"" Fars also took all the credit at the get-go: . ""TEHRAN (FNA) -- According to the results of a Gallup poll released Monday, the overwhelming majority of rural white Americans said they would rather vote for Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad than US President Barack Obama."" (The Onion story used a Charleston, West Virginia, dateline.) The article went on to quote a West Virginia resident as saying he would rather grab a ballgame or a drink with the Iranian leader than with Obama. The phony resident then lauded Ahmadinejad: ""He takes national defense seriously, and he'd never let some gay protesters tell him how to run his country like Obama does."" If that weren't enough, Fars continued, ""According to the same Gallup poll, 60 percent of rural whites said they at least respected that Ahmadinejad doesn't try to hide the fact that he's Muslim."" A Fars news editor said Friday that the outlet took the item off its English-language website once editors realized that The Onion wasn't a legitimate news organization. Without breaking from its farce, Onion Editor Will Tracy wrote in an e-mail that Fars is a subsidiary and has been ""our Middle Eastern bureau since the mid 1980s, when the Onion's publisher, T. Herman Zweibel, founded Fars with the government approval of the late Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini. ""The Onion freely shares content with Fars and commends the journalists at Iran's Finest News Source on their superb reportage,"" Tracy wrote in his statement. There's no word on whether either president is laughing. CNN's Tricia Escobedo and Shirzad Bozorgmehr contributed to this report.","Iran's semi-official Fars News Agency falls for an Onion story .

"(CNN) -- ""Moments like these, terrible as they are, don't show our weakness; they show our strength."" These words were spoken by Suffolk County, Massachusetts, District Attorney Dan Conley after Monday's terror attack in Boston. A day later, signs of that strength are seen in the stories of people -- you might call them heroes -- who were near the Boston Marathon finish line when two bombs exploded seconds apart. Honoring a son . Carlos Arredondo's story began nearly nine years ago, when he doused himself with gasoline and used a welder's torch to set his body on fire. Arredondo, a Costa Rican immigrant living in Florida, had just been told his 20-year-old son, Marine Lance Cpl. Alexander Arredondo, was killed in combat in Iraq. Arredondo initially thought the three Marines pulling up to his home were bringing his son to surprise him on his 44th birthday. Arredondo, now 52, recovered from his burns and became a peace activist, traveling the United States with a coffin filled with his son's possessions. This journey brought him to the marathon finish line to watch someone who was running in honor of his son. Arredondo handed out American flags to spectators. He wore two buttons on his shirt with photographs of Alexander and his other son, who committed suicide at age 24. What happened next could have been a scene familiar to his Marine son: A bomb exploded. Arredondo is seen on video, wearing a cowboy hat, helping National Guard troops, police and firefighters wrestle a fence open to allow emergency responders to reach the dozens of wounded people bleeding on the Boston sidewalk. Once there, Arredondo found a young man -- perhaps the age of his son -- bleeding from serious leg wounds. ""I just concentrated on that young man and tied him up, his legs, and talked to him,"" Arredondo said, his hands trembling, in a video posted on YouTube. He used part of his clothing to make a tourniquet to slow the blood loss from the man's severed artery. ""He was conscious,"" Arredondo said. ""I let him know the ambulance is on the way, that it's OK."" When paramedics arrived, Arredondo helped put the man in a wheelchair. A news photo that has become an iconic image of the tragedy shows Arredondo, his hands covered in blood, running alongside as the man is rushed to an ambulance. ""There were so many people who lay next to me begging me for help, begging me for help, but I only can help one at a time,"" he said. ""So I just helped that young man."" The man told Arredondo his name, but he couldn't remember it later. Hours later, he still held on to an American flag, now stained with blood. Running to help . Dr. Vivek Shah was 25 yards away from finishing the 26.2-mile run when the first bomb exploded to his left. He wasn't sure ""whether it was the fireworks gone bad or something that was supposed to happen,"" Shah said Tuesday. ""Then, after the second explosion went off, we knew something was wrong because all of the spectators and fans started running away from us,"" Shah said. Shah's story represents the heroism of many other medical professionals who were close by when the terror began: doctors, nurses and paramedics who were running, spectators in the stands or waiting at the finish line to treat exhausted runners. Sources: Bombs were likely in pressure cookers . ""My whole family was on that side where the explosions had gone off,"" Shah said. ""So I started running towards where the bombs had gone off to check on my family and see if there was anything I could do to help."" What he found on the sidewalk was beyond anything he's seen as an orthopedic surgeon. ""It's nothing that you can ever describe,"" he said. ""In all of my medical training, I've never seen anything like the amount of trauma I saw yesterday on the sidewalk there."" When Shah reached the wounded, he was not alone. ""By the time I got there, there were so many first responders and volunteer physicians,"" he said. ""I've never seen anything like it in terms of the quickness of the response to that tragedy."" Time is vital in saving lives, according to CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta. Doctors call the first 60 minutes the ""golden hour"" in trauma response, he said. Within the first 15 minutes, 15 patients were at Brigham and Women's Hospital, a Level I trauma center, Gupta said. Seven operating rooms were immediately cleared for the nine patients needing surgery, he said. Already a hero . Joe Andruzzi could be called a hero even before Monday. The former New England Patriots lineman helps children with brain cancer and their families pay for their treatments through his foundation. The Joe Andruzzi Foundation had a team of runners in the Boston Marathon to raise money to help more patients. Andruzzi, who was near the finish line when the bombs exploded, rushed to help, along with many others. When football fans recognized him in photos, carrying a wounded woman to a triage tent, Andruzzi was quick to downplay his role. ""While I appreciate the interest in hearing our perspective on today's horrific events, the spotlight should remain firmly on the countless individuals -- first responders, medics, EMTs, runners who crossed the finish line and kept on running straight to give blood, and the countless civilians who did whatever they could to save lives,"" he said in a statement Monday. ""They were the true heroes. Our thoughts and prayers go out to all those affected by this senseless tragedy."" Andruzzi knows heroes. His brothers were New York firefighters involved in the September 11, 2001, World Trade Center attack. Anonymous hero . A Northeastern University student seriously wounded by shrapnel from the first blast is searching for her personal hero, a man she knows only as Tyler. Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick is helping the woman, whom he met at Tufts Medical Center, to find Tyler. Victoria -- he didn't give her last name -- was scared and, ""as she described it, hysterical"" when a firefighter carried her to the medical tent near the finish line, Patrick said at a news conference Tuesday. ""There was a person who helped calm her down, who described himself as an Army sergeant, an Afghanistan vet,"" Patrick said. ""I don't know whether he was assigned to medical tent or, like so many people there and elsewhere in the commonwealth, just jumped in to help."" Tyler helped Victoria in a way few people could. ""One of things he said to her to calm her down was to show her his own shrapnel wound or scar from ... when he was in Afghanistan,"" he said. An ambulance took Victoria to Tufts Medical Center, but her memory of Tyler followed. ""Victoria very, very much wants to thank Tyler personally,"" Patrick said. ""So, if Tyler is out there and listening or reading your reports, we would love to hear from Tyler so that we can connect him to Victoria."" Call the governor's office, Tyler. The number is 617-725-4000. CNN's Sarah Aarthun contributed to this report.","NEW: Wounded woman searches for her personal hero, Tyler .

"(CNN) -- An online petition to save a healthy young giraffe from death has failed, despite thousands of signatures from animal lovers. Copenhagen Zoo said it euthanized the male, named Marius, on Sunday because of a duty to avoid inbreeding. After an autopsy, ""Marius"" was dismembered in front of a zoo audience that included children, and fed to the zoo's lions. Despite online uproar over the move and reports of last-minute attempts to save the animal, the zoo in the Danish capital said it had no place for Marius in its giraffe herd. ""Our giraffes are part of an international breeding program, which has a purpose of ensuring a sound and healthy population of giraffes,"" Bengt Holst, scientific director at Copenhagen Zoo, told CNN. ""It can only be done by matching the genetic composition of the various animals with the available space. ... When giraffes breed as well as they do now, then you will inevitably run into so-called surplus problems now and then."" CNN anchor Jonathan Mann asked Holst if it would have been possible to sterilize Marius or move him to another zoo to avoid killing him. ""If we just sterilize him, he will take up space for more genetically valuable giraffes,"" Holst answered. Did the children watching cry? Mann asked. Just the opposite, Holst said. The crowd was ""very enthusiastic"" and ""the kids asked good questions."" Fed to the lions . The carcass was used partly for research and partly to feed carnivores at the zoo -- lions, tigers, and leopards. ""In this case we would never throw away 200 kilograms of meat,"" Holst said. He said the giraffe was 2 years old, and while he was not officially named, his keepers had called him Marius to identify him. The giraffe's impending death had sparked outrage online, with more than 27,000 people signing a ""Save Marius"" petition, appealing for a last-minute change of heart. ""The zoo has raised him so it is their responsibility to find him a home,"" author Maria Evans wrote on the petition site. Copenhagen Zoo said that due to a massive debate on its Facebook page, it had published a Q&A about the decision on its website. ""It is not possible to transfer the giraffe to another zoo as it will cause inbreeding,"" it said. Several zoos volunteered to take Marius in. The UK's Yorkshire Wildlife Park, which says it has a state-of-the-art giraffe house and the capacity for an extra male, was among several places which put in offers to take him. International breeding program . Copenhagen Zoo said only zoos that follow certain rules can be part of international breeding programs. In Europe, these are members of the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria. The association counts just over 300 members and under its rules, inbreeding among giraffes is to be avoided. The association said in a statement Sunday that it supports the zoo's decision. Despite Marius being healthy, his genes are already well represented at the zoo. Releasing the giraffe into the wild would be unlikely to succeed, Copenhagen Zoo said. Contraceptives ""have a number of unwanted side effects on the internal organs and we would therefore apply a poorer animal welfare if we did not euthanize,"" it said. It also made clear that its policy was not to sell the animals. Outside autopsy . Holst told CNN the autopsy had been performed outside, given the giraffe's size, and watched by the public, including children if their parents allowed them to. ""It is a good opportunity to invite our guests to watch. ... We are here to educate people and that is a good way to show people what a giraffe looks like,"" he said. ""People could come into this area if they wanted to. They came with children, without children, we had a lot of people."" He said a group of about 16 protesters had gathered outside the zoo on Sunday morning and that he had tried to speak with them. He said all options had been explored before the decision had been made. ""We have always been very open about it, explaining why we are doing it,"" he said. On average, he said some 20 to 30 animals, including goats, antelopes and wild boar, were culled for the same reason every year at the zoo. ""This is the first giraffe. ... I do not understand the outrage -- we are all used to on a current basis of animals being culled in the wild,"" he said. ""We have to ensure a safe healthy population for the future, and you can only have a healthy population if you control and coordinate your breeding efforts.""

"(CNN) -- Iraq's prime minister said Tuesday he is happy to see the United States and its Arab allies striking ISIS targets in Syria, so long as they ""do it right this time."" Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that Iraq has ""paid a heavy price"" for polarization in the region and instability in Syria, saying ISIS fighters have inflicted tremendous pain, suffering and losses on his people after crossing into Iraq. He expressed hope the airstrikes will do what U.S. President Barack Obama has vowed: degrade and destroy the group, which calls itself the Islamic State. It's good some Arab nations have joined the American-led military campaign, al-Abadi added, though he said he wished they had understood and acted on the danger posed by ISIS sooner. ""We have warned ... this is going to end in a bloodbath if nobody stops it,"" he said. ""Nobody was listening."" The newly installed prime minister said, ""I personally am happy that everybody is seeing this danger, so that they are going to do something about it. And I hope they ... do it right, and they don't do it their own way."" Elaborating on that latter point, al-Abadi said, ""I hope we're not going to see a crush of DAIISH"" -- another term for ISIS that some say sounds like an Arabic word for ""to trample on,"" which the militants reportedly despise -- ""and the rise of another terrorist element instead of them."" U.S.-Arab coalition bolstered by show of force . One thing the U.S. military has not done well enough when it comes to its strikes against ISIS targets in Iraq is work in close coordination with Iraqi ground forces, according to al-Abadi. ""Our forces are moving forward and, when they are moving forward, they need air cover, they need air support,"" said the prime minister. ""That air support is not forthcoming."" Al-Abadi added: ""We ask for it, but of course the coalition -- they have their own ... plan."" U.S.-led airstrikes in Syria: Who's in, who's not . 'If we don't work together, we don't deserve a country' That comment may beg the question: What is al-Abadi's plan for Iraq? The Middle Eastern nation has been in turmoil for years. In addition to questions about its effectiveness in providing security and basic needs to its people, the government was panned for being dominated by Shiite Muslims -- like former Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki -- and alienating Sunnis. (Notably, ISIS is made up of Sunnis pushing to institute their hard-line brand of Sharia law in any territory they control, while ruthlessly lashing out at those who don't subscribe to their mission.) After Obama's withdrawal of U.S. ground troops, Iraq's military was maligned, especially after ISIS fighters speedily overran wide swaths of the country, at times prompting Iraqi troops to drop their weapons and run. Al-Abadi conceded Tuesday that the Islamist extremist group controls at least 25% of land in his country and is on the doorstep of the capital, Baghdad. Iraqi soldiers, police flee posts in Mosul . This isn't to say al-Abadi deserves blame for this predicament. He officially took power on September 8, a few weeks after being endorsed by al-Maliki, his fellow Shiite and Islamic Dawa Party member. Still, even if he hasn't been in charge long, this is al-Abadi's problem now. The new prime minister said he does not want militias any more in Iraq, saying armed forces ""must all be under the umbrella of the state."" Al-Abadi added that he prefers that those in ISIS-controlled territories ""liberate their own areas"" with support from the government, rather than have Iraqi troops march in. As to bringing the country together, the Iraqi leader said, ""We've worked hard to make (the government) more inclusive"" and ""I think we've got (Sunnis) almost on board right now."" Al-Abadi said a priority for him after he leaves New York -- where he, like other world leaders, are at the U.N. General Assembly -- will be nominating defense and interior ministers, one of whom will be Sunni. Its history of secular and political division, not to mention bloodshed, notwithstanding, al-Abadi said Iraq can survive if Shiites and Sunnis can work together. ""I think we can. We have to,"" he added. ""... This is our country. And if we don't work together, we don't deserve a country. ""... We have to work together. We have to give in to each other. And I'm prepared to do hard decisions. ... I expect others to do their own as well.""","NEW: Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi: Sunnis ""almost on board"" with Shiite-led government .

"(CNN) -- New Hampshire is all about the independents. And that's why it's the best test of general election electability. While Iowa's caucuses are disproportionately dominated by social conservatives, in New Hampshire's open primary, independents can vote -- and they make up more than 40% of the local electorate. That's right -- in New Hampshire, registered independents outnumber Republicans or Democrats. It's a libertarian instinct reflected in the state's motto, ""Live Free or Die."" It's captured in the wonderful fact that in the northern town named ""Freedom,"" independents make up the bulk of the 1,000-plus voters. It's also reflected in the fact that New Hampshire is one of the least religious states in the nation. Likewise, a Pew Research Center poll conducted before the 2008 primary found that 55% of New Hampshire Republican primary voters believed that abortion should be always or mostly legal, while just 13% of New Hampshire GOP primary voters said abortion should be always illegal -- posing a problem for fundamentalists like Rick Santorum who support a constitutional ban on abortion. Fiscal conservatives rule the roost in the New Hampshire Republican Party, which is committed to the state's anti-income tax tradition with a focus on balanced budgets and a concurrent aversion to deficit spending. While President Obama won the state by 9 percentage points in 2008, his in-state approval rating is just 41% today. To add to its relevance, New Hampshire is a general election swing state, unlike, say, South Carolina. Decades ago the Granite State was considered rock-ribbed Republican, but as the national Republican Party moved further right, especially on social issues, New Hampshire -- like much of the Northeast -- started to declare its independence. Bill Clinton won the state twice in the 1990s, George W. Bush won it in 2000 and John Kerry in 2004. Follow developments on the CNN Political Ticker's live blog . To add to the portrait of swing state diversity, the state's two senators are split between Republicans and Democrats -- Kelly Ayotte and Jean Shaheen. The state's governor, John Lynch, is a centrist Democrat who was re-elected by a 75-25 margin and is serving his fourth term. He is not running for re-election in 2012. Mitt Romney has enjoyed a double-digit lead in New Hampshire for months. It's not surprising -- the former Massachusetts governor came in second to John McCain there in 2008. Romney holds the distinction of being the only statewide elected official from Massachusetts who failed to win the New Hampshire primary. John McCain's endorsement of Romney is intended to solidify the front-runner's status as the candidate of the responsible center-right. But even with the two-time New Hampshire primary winner's benediction, Romney could see tightening margins in the final days before Tuesday's vote. Jon Huntsman has been camped out in New Hampshire for the past six months, trying to rally Granite Staters around his center-right campaign, promising fiscal conservatism alongside a healthy critique of absolutism on social issues. Likewise, Ron Paul, whose campaign doubled his 2008 totals in Iowa on Tuesday night, is poised for a strong showing in the Live Free or Die State. If Huntsman and Paul continue to gain support with New Hampshire independent voters, they will eat into Romney's lead, helping Rick Santorum close the gap with Romney. To get a sense of Santorum's potential base in the state, remember that Mike Huckabee came in third in 2008. New Hampshire is a very healthy stop for the GOP during the January gantlet, positioned between Iowa and South Carolina. It gives the Republican Party a primary electorate that is representative of the audience the nominee will need to appeal to in November. Florida is a broadly diverse state, but it still has a closed primary. Open primaries offer the broadest choice and the best test of national electability, focusing on fiscal issues rather than social issues. New Hampshire offers the antidote to a polarized Republican Party whose primaries are too often distorted by the fringe blurring with the base. It is a state where centrist candidates are rewarded, reinforcing the wisdom that presidential elections are won by the candidate who connects best with moderates and the middle class.

"(CNN) -- The mother of a 16-year-old filed a federal lawsuit against the South Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles on Tuesday claiming her son was sexually discriminated against when he was forced to remove his facial makeup for a driver's license photo. Chase Culpepper, 16, was born a male but is gender nonconforming. He regularly wears makeup and clothing typically worn by women, according to the lawsuit. After passing his driver's test in June, Chase went to have his license photo taken. But an employee at the office asked him to remove his makeup. The employee told Chase he couldn't wear ""a disguise"" and didn't look ""like a boy should,"" the teen told CNN affiliate WYFF. The lawsuit says Chase was discriminated against based on the employee's gender stereotypes and Chase's constitutional rights to freedom of speech and expression were violated. The state DMV said in June it had a policy specifying the requirements for the photograph. ""At no time will an applicant be photographed when it appears that he or she is purposely altering his or her appearance so that the photo would misrepresent his or her identity,"" the policy says. ""That's been the policy since August of 2009,"" spokeswoman Beth Parks said. ""Stage makeup is not acceptable because it can be used to alter appearance. Regular everyday makeup is accepted because it's used to highlight or hide blemishes,"" she said. The lawsuit says the photo policy is vague and overbroad because of its use of the term ""identity."" The suit alleges the employees have interpreted it ""to prohibit a male applicant from wearing regular everyday makeup that they allow female applicants to wear under the same policy."" ""Chase Culpepper is entitled to be himself and to express his gender nonconformity without interference from the South Carolina DMV,"" said Michael Silverman, the executive director of the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund. ""It is not the role of the DMV or any government agency or employee to decide how men and women should look. Chase should be able to get a driver's license without being subjected to sex discrimination,"" Silverman said Tuesday at a joint press conference with Culpepper and his mother. Calls and emails to the state DMV communications office were not immediately returned late Tuesday. The lawsuit is not seeking damages or money but asking that changes be made to the DMV's photo policy and that Chase be allowed to retake his license photo while wearing his everyday makeup.

"(CNN) -- The e-mail arrived from Uzbekistan on February 26. It was titled ""Bad News."" Abdul Dadahanov had intended to study business, but changed his mind after 9/11, his academic adviser said. ""Dear Mama Judy,"" a young woman named Aziza Dadahanov wrote in shaky English. ""Very very bad news!!! Abdul is given 8 years of prison. Today was the verdict. Now i feel myself very bad. And i can't write now. I am shocked."" ""It was like being kicked in the stomach,"" recalled Judy Skartvedt, a retired flight attendant living in Easton, Connecticut. She knew Dadahanov's husband, Abdul Dadahanov, as an Uzbek exchange student who had wanted to help heal people after the 9/11 attacks. She thought of him as an open-minded Muslim whom her family had hosted when he came on a scholarship to study at Fairfield University in 2001. ""We were totally shocked that someone like Abdul could be arrested for anything,"" Skartvedt said. ""We haven't stopped worrying about his safety."" The 32-year-old faces eight years in a labor camp for participation in what the Uzbekistan government says is an extremist religious organization, according to Forum 18, a religious freedom watchdog organization . The group says that Uzbek security forces arrested Dadahanov and four other men -- Bakhrom Ibrahimov, Davron Kabilov, Rovshanbek Favoyev and Botyrbek Eshkuziyev -- last summer after the men had written for an Islamic journal called Irmoq. The National Security Service reportedly claimed the magazine was ""sponsored by a Turkish radical religious movement."" Officials from the Embassy of Uzbekistan in Washington have refused to comment on the case. Forum 18 says Dadahanov and the four other Uzbek men were convicted of ""dissemination of information and materials containing ideas of religious extremism, separatism and fundamentalism, calls for pogroms or violent eviction of individuals aimed at creating panic among the population."" Human rights organizations say the convictions appear to be part of a broader crackdown in the former Soviet republic, targeting members of ""Nurchilar,"" a moderate Muslim movement of Turkish origin, which follows the writing of a 19th-century Sufi Muslim theologian. ""Unfortunately this is not an unusual case,"" said Igor Vorontsov, a researcher with Human Rights Watch in St. Petersburg. ""The [Uzbek] government has persisted in its persecution of independent Muslims."" Thousands of miles from the Republic of Uzbekistan, news of Dadahanov's jail sentence has stunned academics and Christian community leaders in Connecticut. They fondly describe a committed social activist and observant Muslim, who rode between work and classes on a secondhand bicycle and spent more than a year distributing food to soup kitchens in one of America's poorer cities. ""He had a naive trust in the goodness of human beings,"" said Patty Jenson, an administrator at the Council of Churches of Greater Bridgeport. ""I am shocked. I know he is there [in prison] unjustly. What is happening is unjust."" ""He was a man of his word, he was gentle and kind,"" said Charlene Chambers, the director of King's Pantry, a nonprofit organization that distributes food to homeless people in Bridgeport. ""Our common bond was feeding people who can't feed themselves and clothing those people who can't clothe themselves."" Dadahanov's academic adviser, Katherine Kidd, said the young Uzbek originally intended to study business when he arrived at Fairfield University on a scholarship from the Open Society Institute of the Soros Foundation. That changed September 11, 2001. Kidd choked up as she recalled his visit to her office, hours after the terrorist attacks. ""He said, 'Dr. Kidd, I have to do something to tell people that this is not what Islam is about.' He said, 'I want to be part of things that are done here to bring healing to people after 9/11.' "" Dadahanov began working closely with Kidd's husband, Pastor John Kidd, who was a Lutheran minister and the executive director of the Council of Churches of Greater Bridgeport. Pastor Kidd helped Dadahanov tour churches and work with synagogues, giving lectures on his interpretation of Islam. Dadahanov also appeared before audiences dressed in traditional Central Asian attire, in an effort to spread cultural awareness about Uzbekistan. Advisers say the young Uzbek was inspired by his interaction with church and community groups. Gradually, he shifted his academic focus from business to grassroots community service and education reform. ""He would regularly say 'Wow, how can I do this in Uzbekistan, and make my country and my community better and stronger?'"" Katherine Kidd explained. Dadahanov helped establish a small prayer room for Muslim students at Fairfield University. He also launched a book drive, shipping secondhand books to Uzbekistan to help teach English in his home country. And he was eventually hired at the Council of Churches, and tasked with distributing Federal Emergency Management Agency funds to 26 feeding programs across Bridgeport. ""He wanted to be involved in the frontline programs,"" John Kidd said. ""Ultimately, it's sad that all these things he came to see in terms of how you build a community, how you take responsibility for the life of a community, is at least in part what put him at odds with the authorities in Uzbekistan."" When he returned to Uzbekistan in 2004 after two and a half years in Connecticut, Dadahanov set up an English-language school with friends. The school offered English lessons to young Uzbeks at an affordable price -- a remarkable achievement in a society in which the government controls almost all facets of the economy. There is little tolerance for independent grassroots activism in Uzbekistan. The country has had the same authoritarian president, Islam Karimov, since it won independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. The State Department's recently published 2008 human rights report states ""torture remain systemic in [Uzbekistan's] law enforcement ... human rights activists and journalists who criticized the government continued to be subjected to harassment, arbitrary arrest, politically motivated prosecution, forced psychiatric treatment and physical attack."" Uzbek security forces frequently target religious activists. ""The government has almost a paranoia of any independent religious activity, particularly those related to Islam,"" said Sean Roberts, a Central Asia expert at George Washington University. ""The Uzbek government tries to control the religious sector very similar to the way the Soviets did. They have a state Muslim board that oversees what is proper Islam - anything that falls out of that scope is seen as threatening and seditious."" The Uzbek government says it ""views the ensuring of human rights and freedoms of its citizens as its highest priority."" A statement posted on the Web site of the Embassy of Uzbekistan in Washington cited the passage of more then 120 laws and 60 international treaties aimed at improving the country's human rights record. The Uzbek government says it is making reforms of its judicial and penitentiary system, aimed at ""prosecuting and punishing for the use of torture and other forms of ill-treatment."" Dadahanov's former professors invited him to return on a scholarship to the United States after his arrest, and two families offered to house Dadahanov, his wife Aziza and young son Abdulrahman. Dr. Orin Grossman, Fairfield University's academic vice president, hoped the graduate school offer would allow Uzbek authorities to release Dadahanov. ""It obviously didn't work,"" he wrote in an e-mail to CNN. Accounts of appalling conditions in Uzbek prisons have worried Dadahanov's American friends, who remember how the slim Uzbek rode to barbecues on his bicycle, carrying a giant watermelon in a backpack as a gift. The hardest part has been trying to get information from Dadahanov's family in Tashkent. ""The government is tapping their phone and tracking their e-mail,"" Katherine Kidd said. ""We're pretty much sure neither of those is secure from the government.""","Abdul Dadahanov jailed in Uzbekistan, accused of extremist religious activities .

"(CNN) -- Terrorism is losing, Vice President Joe Biden said Wednesday in his eulogy for Sean Collier, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology campus cop who authorities say was killed by the suspected Boston Marathon bombers last week. ""We have suffered. We are grieving. But we are not bending,"" Biden said. ""We will not be intimidated."" In remarks at the memorial service Wednesday, Biden also consoled Collier's family, describing the slain officer as ""a remarkable son"" and ""a remarkable brother."" ""No child should pre-decease their parents,"" Biden said to the family. ""Though every loss is different, one thing is central. I know from experience that sense of dread reliving the moment of the last nine days, almost hourly, the moment you learn the fate of your child -- the sense of hollowness and being sucked into a void you can't control."" The vice president lost his first wife and infant daughter in a car crash in 1972. But he said the day will come for the family when the memory of Collier will prompt a smile before any tears. Biden also praised the hundreds of hundreds of law enforcement officers dressed in crisp blue uniforms and gathered outdoors for the memorial service, held on Briggs Field at MIT. ""On every front, terrorism as a weapon is losing,"" Biden said. ""It is not gaining adherents. What galls them the most is that America remains that shining city on the hill."" The memorial service stage featured a massive American flag as a backdrop, with a photograph of Collier. Singer James Taylor performed, accompanied by the MIT Symphony Orchestra. Collier, 27, was described last week by friends and colleagues as having an easy smile and a willingness to help others. He enjoyed policing. The officer was buried Tuesday after a private memorial service in Stoneham, Massachusetts, CNN affiliate WHDH reported. Authorities believe the two men suspected of detonating bombs at the marathon shot Collier to death as he sat in his squad car on the MIT campus last week. Collier's killing and a subsequent carjacking nearby set off the search that paralyzed Boston for almost 24 hours. One of the suspects, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, died after a shootout with police early Friday. His younger brother, Dzhokhar, was hospitalized following his capture later that day.","NEW: Vice president tells family that Collier was ""a remarkable son""

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Scientists are claiming they have discovered a new species of monkey living in the remote forests of the Democratic Republic of Congo -- an animal well-known to local hunters but until now, unknown to the outside world. In a paper published Wednesday in the open-access journal Plos One, the scientists describe the new species that they call Cercopithecus Lomamiensis, known locally as the Lesula, whose home is deep in central DR Congo's Lomami forest basin. The scientists say it is only the second discovery of a monkey species in 28 years. In an age where so much of the earth's surface has been photographed, digitized, and placed on a searchable map on the web discoveries like this one by a group of American scientists this seem a throwback to another time. Who's the monkey? See Lesula's famous lookalikes . ""We never expected to find a new species there,"" says John Hart, the lead scientist of the project, ""but the Lomami basin is a very large block that has had very little exploration by biologists."" Hart says that the rigorous scientific process to determine the new species started with a piece of luck, strong field teams, and an unlikely field sighting in a small forest town. ""Our Congolese field teams were on a routine stop in Opala. It is the closest settlement of any kind to the area of forest we were working in,"" says Hart. The team came across a strange looking monkey tethered to a post. It was the pet of Georgette, the daughter of the local school director. She adopted the young monkey when its mother was killed by a hunter in the forest. Her father said it was a Lesula, well-known to hunters in that part of the forest. The field team took pictures and showed them to Hart. ""Right away I saw that this was something different. It looked a bit like a monkey from much further east, but the coloring was so different and the range was so different,"" said Hart. The monkey to the east is the semi-terrestrial owl-faced monkey. Based on the photos, Hart believed that their shape and size could be similar, but their morphology or outward appearance was very distinct. The Lesula had strikingly large, almost human like, eyes, a pink face and golden mane. Far to the east, across several large river systems, the Owl Face is aptly named. Its sunken eyes are set deep in a dark face, a white stripe running down from its brow to its mouth, like a line of chalk on a blackboard. To a layman it looks like an open and shut case. But animals are often widely divergent within a species -- humans are an obvious example -- so Hart and his team needed science to prove their gut feeling. ""I got in touch with geneticists and anthropologists to get their advice. I knew it was important to have a collaborative team of experts,"" says Hart. The exhaustive study took three years. Hart's teams set up digital sound recorders in the forests to record the morning calls of the Owl Face and Lesula monkeys. They analyzed the ecology of the forest and behavior of the shy and difficult to observe monkey. Field teams collected Lesula specimens from hunters and monkeys freshly killed by leopards and once, a crowned eagle (the field worker had to wait for the eagle to leave its perch, says Hart). The specimens were shipped to two research centers in the U.S and the data shared with labs across the country. Christopher Gilbert, an anthropologist based at Hunter College in Manhattan, says the difference in appearance between the Lesula and Owl Face was striking. ""After comparing the skins, we immediately concluded that this was probably something different [than] we had seen before,"" says Gilbert, an expert in primate and monkey evolution. Skulls of the Lesula and Owl Face monkey were measured with calipers and digitally drawn in 3D. ""We looked at the difference in shape and a number of landmarks in the skulls,"" says Gilbert. Previously on CNN.com: New species discovered in South American jungle . While the Owl Face and Lesula had similar sized skulls, he says, the Lesula had significantly larger orbits and several other small, but statistically significant, differences in the hard anatomy of the skull. The anatomical studies are backed up by genetics. Scientists at New York University and Florida Atlantic University were able trace an ancient common ancestor. Scientists believe the monkeys evolved separately after a series of rivers separated their habitats. ""The clincher was that lab and field teams were able to document significant difference in conjunction with the genetics. The monkeys were different and have been different for a couple of million years. It demonstrates that there are places in the world that we do not know much about,"" says Gilbert. The Lesula's range covers an area of about 6,500 square miles (17,000 square kilometers) between the Lomani and Tshuapa Rivers. Until recently, it was one of the Congo's least biologically explored forest blocks. Hart hopes that the announcement will bring a renewed effort to save central Africa's pristine forests. Under threat by loggers, bush meat hunters, and weak national governments, the forests are a potential well of important scientific discoveries, and a key linchpin of the earth's biodiversity. Teresa and John Hart's Lukuru Foundation is working with the Congolese authorities to establish a national park in the Lomani basin before it loses its unique biodiversity. ""The challenge now is to make the Lesula an iconic species that carries the message for conservation of all of DR Congo's endangered fauna,"" says Hart. And what of the first Lesula they found -- Georgette's pet. After he saw the pictures, Hart regularly sent a team to keep track of the young Lesula's progress. At some point Georgette let the monkey roam free. ""It seems someone captured it,"" says Hart, ""it probably ended up in the cooking pot."" He hopes that with proper protection, the Lesula, and the rest of Lomani's incredible animal biodiversity, won't suffer a similar fate. 2011: 'Yoda bat' stars in book of newly discovered species .","New monkey discovery is only second such find in 28 years .

"(CNN) -- Photographer Paul Hellstern snapped his shutter just minutes after the tornado reduced Oklahoma City's Briarwood Elementary School to rubble. In that fraction of a second, he captured the courage and selflessness that overcame adults at the school in the moments after the Monday devastation. ""I'd just arrived, probably five minutes after the tornado passed, and came into that neighborhood and noticed that school there and children pouring out,"" he told CNN's Chris Cuomo. ""It was pandemonium, with children crying everywhere, bloody teachers and so forth."" Cameras ready, the photographer for The Oklahoman, the Oklahoma City area's only daily newspaper, ran as quickly as he could to capture images from the scene. Teachers save lives during tornado . Police and emergency officials had yet to arrive, but Hellstern said teachers were carrying and escorting children out of the debris that once was their school. The teachers themselves were injured, Hellstern said. One had an ankle injury. Many were bloodied.

She peers over his shoulder as he carries her away from the school. Inside a tornado-ravaged school . Following him is his wife, LaDonna Cobb, blood over her left eyebrow and smeared down her face and neck, onto the frills of her V-neck collar. She appears to have a black eye, and she's holding the hand of a crying, barefoot girl with a large heart on her blue T-shirt. ""We're lucky to be alive, and our hearts go out to those who weren't as fortunate,"" LaDonna Cobb told CNN's Piers Morgan. ""We'll heal. We're here. That's what's most important."" A teacher at Brairwood, she had the day of the tornado off. She and her husband were going to close on a house but they went to the school to check on their three children as the storm approached. ""Him, and I and the teacher just jumped on top of the kids and rode it out there,"" she said. Steve Cobb told Morgan that he had doubts. ""I was truly fearful. I didn't think we were going to live. I thought it was just going to flatten everything out and we would probably die. But somehow or another everyone survived. Mapping the twister's 40-mile path of devastation . Hellstern said he was amazed by the adults' response, especially those who gathered their composure to bring children out of the school, then returned to the rubble to search for more. Police and emergency officials soon joined them in the search. Hellstern said he was moved to see distraught children and parents reunite at the school of about 700 students, located in the Oklahoma capital. ""The emotion of seeing parents come together with their children for that first moment, finding them alive and still well, was exciting,"" he said. How to help . Another of Hellstern's photographs captured a child leaping into a man's arms. The man cradles the child's head with one hand and hugs his waist with the other, his face flush with emotion. The man is Jim Routon, the child a 7-year-old boy named Hezekiah. They are just neighbors, but the love and relief in the photo bespeaks the bond of blood relatives. Hours after the shutter snapped and media around the world published Hellstern's photograph, details of their story came into focus. Hezekiah, a first-grader, described the picture to Routon: ""I knew that you were going to pick me up, so I just jumped. And I just started hugging you really hard. I was crying a little bit, and I was happy that I survived."" Routon said he needed the hug as much as Hezekiah did. ""It was so chaotic. We just weren't sure. The school was pretty much devastated and mostly destroyed. We weren't sure if anyone was going to come out alive,"" he told CNN's Erin Burnett. ""To go over and see one of my favorite neighbor's child emerge, it was awesome. It was just an amazing feeling."" Routon said it's hard to believe a photograph of him and his neighbor is among the dramatic images of the storm transmitted far beyond his state's borders. But the stories of recovery that the photos tell are inspiring to many Oklahomans, too, he said. ""It actually helps us, you know, in the healing process,"" Routon said, ""and helps us to learn and see that ... we have to depend on one another to get through these types of things.""

"Washington (CNN) -- The Senate on Tuesday rejected an amendment to tighten restrictions on federal funding for abortion in the sweeping health care bill it is debating. On a 54-45 vote, the chamber agreed to table the amendment, which effectively killed it from further consideration. Rejection of the amendment means the Senate health bill, if approved with the current abortion language, would differ from more restrictive language in the House version of the bill passed last month. The amendment filed Monday by Sens. Ben Nelson, D-Nebraska, and Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, mirrored language in the House bill that prevents any health plan receiving federal subsidies from offering coverage for abortion. Anti-abortion legislators said the amendment would maintain the current level of restriction by preventing any federal funding for abortion except in the case of rape, incest or a threat to the life of the mother. Hatch argued Tuesday that the Senate proposal as originally written provides a loophole for the use of federal money to subsidize health insurance that would cover abortion. ""Taxpayers should not be called upon to pay for abortion,"" Hatch said. Other GOP senators said the strong opposition by millions of Americans to federal funding for abortion should be respected by passing the amendment to tighten restrictions. Nelson had warned that without the amendment, he could vote against ending debate on the bill. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, needs 60 votes to close debate on the bill and bring it to a vote, and 51 votes for final passage. In the Senate, the Democratic caucus has 60 members. If Nelson or any other Democrats break with the caucus, Reid will need some Republican support to move forward. Senate Republicans unanimously oppose the bill. Opponents of the tougher language argued that the amendment would expand the current level of restriction because women receiving coverage under a federally subsidized health care plan would be barred from purchasing abortion coverage with their own money. ""Why are women being singled out here? It's so unfair,"" said Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-California, adding there is no medical procedure for men that cannot be purchased with private funds. Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Michigan, said the real goal of the amendment is to deny women covered by government-funded health care the right to get an abortion. ""Let's keep federal policy in place that does not allow federal funding for abortion but respects the women of this country,"" Stabenow said. Maine's two Republican senators -- Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins -- both joined Democrats in voting to table the amendment, while seven Democrats voted with the chamber's other 38 Republicans against killing the proposal. The House adopted its restrictive language as part of a last-minute concession to anti-abortion legislators who threatened to defeat the health care bill without a vote on the provision. Reid, D-Nevada, said earlier Tuesday he would continue to work with Nelson on the issue if the Nebraska lawmaker's amendment failed. ""I'm happy to work with him,"" Reid said. ""If, in fact, he doesn't succeed here, we'll try something else."" If the Senate eventually passes a bill that gets merged with the House version, the abortion language will be a crucial issue. An anti-abortion bloc in the House threatens to reject a bill without the tougher language adopted by the chamber, while a liberal-progressive House bloc has said it won't accept a bill with the more restrictive provision. Also on Tuesday, liberal and moderate Democrats reached a ""broad agreement"" on the public option portion of the Senate health care bill, Reid said. Without revealing any details, Reid said the negotiating senators had reached an agreement that ""moves this bill way down the road."" Two Democratic sources said the deal includes proposals to replace the public option by creating a not-for-profit private insurance option overseen by the federal Office of Personnel Management, much like the current health plan for federal workers, and another allowing people 55 and older to buy into Medicare coverage that currently is available to those 65 and older. But Sen. Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, one of 10 Democratic senators working on the deal, said in a statement released after Reid's announcement that he would not ""support proposals that would replace the public option in the bill with a purely private approach."" CNN's Dana Bash, Evan Glass and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.","Amendment would have tightened restrictions on federal funding .

"(CNN) -- The long debate on same-sex marriage is coming to an end. A plurality of Americans now support same-sex marriage; the figure is 63% among voters under 30. The rest is just a matter of time. The end of the same-sex marriage debate does not, however, settle the problem of marriage in America. Not remotely. Among the 95% to 97% of Americans who are not gay, the institution of marriage continues to weaken -- with ominous consequences for the next generation. About 40% of all the babies born in the United States are born to unmarried women. Just about everybody agrees that this is a worrying development. As candidate Barack Obama told a Chicago church in 2008: . ""(C)hildren who grow up without a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime, nine times more likely to drop out of schools, and 20 times more likely to end up in prison. They are more likely to have behavioral problems, or run away from home or become teenage parents themselves. And the foundations of our community are weaker because of it."" Of course there are exceptions to every rule. On average, however, children born to unmarried women do worse in all kinds of important ways compared to children born to married couples. They are less likely to complete their schooling, more likely to get in trouble with the law, more likely to have children out of marriage themselves, less likely to achieve upward mobility. The data behind these claims are overwhelming, and not seriously contested by any social scientist -- although every once in a while, somebody will publish an article ""in defense of single motherhood"" that brusquely dismisses the evidence with Stephen Colbert style elan: "" I am not a huge believer in studies."" Same-sex couples take long road to the altar . For those who do believe in social science, the question arises: what to do? And here's where the looming end of the debate over same-sex marriage offers real hope. Last week, the Institute for American Values published a major statement in The New York Times. Signed by 74 luminaries of widely diverse political points of view, it called for a ""new conversation about marriage."" ""The current question is, Should gays marry? The new question is, Who among us, gay or straight, wants to strengthen marriage?"" the statement asked. The Institute for American Values is known as a conservative group. In recent years, its leader, David Blankenhorn, has reconsidered his past opposition to same-sex marriage. This rethinking has cost IAV and Blankenhorn dearly. Board members have resigned, funding sources have been cut. Yet at breakfast two weeks ago in New York City, Blankenhorn was undaunted. The challenges that led him into the marriage debate two decades ago have only become more urgent. As the IAV writes: ""(M)arriage trends in middle America, particularly among the nearly 60 percent of Americans who've graduated from high school but do not have a four-year college degree, are more and more resembling the historic marriage trends in poor and low-income America."" In other words, the middle-class family increasingly looks like the lower-class family -- at an economic moment when it is very easy to tumble out of the middle class and increasingly difficult to climb into it. ""In the wake of the Great Recession and in the midst of severe and possibly long-lasting economic challenges to our society, we propose a new conversation that re-establishes the link between marriage and money, the nest and the nest-egg. What economic policies strengthen marriage? What marriage policies create wealth? In the new conversation, marriage and thrift, the two great engines of the American middle class since the nation's founding, stand best when they stand together."" The United States is becoming an increasingly class-stratified society. The few at the top enjoy unprecedented affluence. The many in the middle and at the bottom face narrowing opportunities and declining standards of living. The dwindling of marriage is both cause and consequence of America's evolution away from a society of equal chances. The restoration of marriage is crucial to reviving the middle class and offering hope to the poor. Marriage means two incomes at a time when most Americans find two incomes essential to earning a middle-class livelihood. Marriage secures the active presence of fathers in children's lives. Marriage means more asset accumulation: Married families save more at every income level. Marriage means fewer accidents and illnesses, less stress, and more happiness and personal fulfillment. Yet even as we reach a new social consensus about marriage's importance, marriage seems to have become increasingly elusive, difficult, and uncertain. It's time for all Americans, left and right, gay and straight, to join David Blankenhorn's ""new conversation."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","Americans, particularly those under 30, increasingly support same-sex marriage .

"Washington (CNN) -- A massive offshore wind farm planned for Cape Cod that has generated fierce political and legal controversy has cleared all federal and state regulatory hurdles. The Federal Aviation Administration said Wednesday the Cape Wind project, the first of its kind in the United States, would not interfere with air traffic navigation and could proceed with certain conditions. Previous agency approvals were challenged in court, including a ruling last year that forced the latest FAA safety evaluation. A leading opposition group said another legal challenge was possible. The Obama administration first approved the power generating project, which has now been on the books for more than a decade, in April 2010 despite opposition from residents. Opponents over the years have included the late Sen. Edward Kennedy, a Democrat of Massachusetts whose family compound is in Hyannis Port. 125 years of wind power . Critics claim the wind farm with its 130 turbines would threaten wildlife and aesthetics of Nantucket Sound. Some local residents also fear it will drive down property values. The administration has pushed a ""green energy"" agenda nationally as a way to create jobs and lessen U.S. dependence on oil imports. That effort, however, has been sharply criticized by congressional Republicans who have said certain high-profile projects are politically driven. They also have skewered certain Energy Department programs that extended millions in taxpayer loans and other aid to alternative energy companies or projects that faltered or did not meet expectations. The Republican-led House Oversight and Government Reform Committee is investigating the political assertions around Cape Wind as part of a broader review of ""green energy"" projects supported by the administration. The panel's chairman, California's Darrell Issa, wrote President Barack Obama last week saying that White House interest in the Massachusetts project is ""well known"" and that the FAA had been under political pressure to approve it. Candidates spar over energy future . A group opposing the project, the Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, also said in a statement to CNN that the FAA disregarded safety and asserted the decision was politically driven. However, the FAA said that it restudied the issue and approval was based solely on safety considerations. A key condition imposed by regulators will require Cape Wind developers to put lights on each of the 440-foot turbines and use specific paint colors to increase visibility for pilots. Cape Wind is being built by private developer Energy Management Inc., a Massachusetts-based energy company. Developers estimate the project will create 600 to 1,000 jobs during construction and 150 full time jobs once complete. ""This FAA approval allows Cape Wind to move forward and jump-start the new American industry in offshore wind power that will help light up the East Coast,"" Cape Wind spokesman Mark Rogers told CNN. The Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound said it would continue to fight Cape Wind. ""No pilot or passenger should allow this politically driven decision to stand. This decision can once again be appealed,"" the Alliance said. If financing can be finalized and Cape Wind is eventually built, the Interior Department's lease will allow it to operate for 25 years, which is the average lifespan of a wind farm.","Federal Aviation Administration says the planned project off Cape Cod is safe for air traffic .

"(CNN) -- The size of a specific part of the brain may help experts pinpoint when autism could first develop, University of North Carolina researchers report. The amygdala helps individuals process faces and emotions. Using MRI brain scans, researchers found that the area of the brain called the amygdala was, on average, 13 percent larger in young children with autism, compared with control group of children without autism. In the study, published in the latest Archives of General Psychiatry, researchers scanned 50 toddlers with autism and 33 children without autism at age 2 and again at age 4. The study adjusted for age, sex and IQ. ""We believe that children with autism have normal-sized brains at birth but at some point, in the latter part of the first year of life, it [the amygdala] begins to grow in kids with autism. And this study gives us insight inside the underlying brain mechanism so we can design more rational interventions,"" said lead study author Dr. Joseph Piven. A normal-sized amygdala helps a person process faces and emotions, behavior commonly known as joint attention. ""When you see a face, you scan it, identify if it's friend or foe and make a decision about whether to move forward or avoid it,"" said Dr. Barry Kosofsky, chief of neurology at Cornell Medical Center, who was not affiliated with the study. UNC researchers conducted diagnostic assessments, in addition to the MRI scans, to monitor the children's behavior. They found toddlers with a large amygdala also had joint attention problems.  Watch Dr. Gupta explain the findings » . ""We would basically try to get the child to look one way, we'd turn and point to a clock and see whether or not the child would notice it,"" explained Piven. ""The 2-year-olds without autism would see your face, see where you are looking and join you but the children with autism, with large amygdalas, would not."" Autism experts agree joint attention difficulty is a key characteristic of autism. It also is the only behavior linked to a large amygdala, according to the study. Researchers found no association between repetitive behavior or other social behaviors and a large amygdala. ""This is a core feature of autism, and it raises a very provocative possibility that if they [joint attention problems] aren't caused by changes in the amygdala, they are certainly associated with it,"" said Kosofsky. Autism experts say such findings are critical in developing new ways to treat and diagnose autism earlier. ""Many studies have observed the brain grows too big in kids with autism, but this study finds that by age 2, the amygdala is already bigger and stops growing,"" said Kosofsky. ""So it tells us the critical difference has already developed. It now poses the question: Are children born with autism or does it develop in the first two years of life?"" Parents cannot run out and ask their doctor to check the size of their child's amygdala to determine their child's autism risk, but researchers hope over time, it can be used as a clinical tool to diagnose the mysterious developmental condition, which affects as many as 1 in 150 children. ""Once we understand the neurological circuits, we may be able to detect if a child has problems in those circuits as early as 6 months of age,"" said Piven. ""If we are able to combine those things, we can better predict and guide interventions. We need to let the pattern of early brain development guide us to predict who is at higher risk and who would benefit from early intervention."" UNC researchers are conducting a follow-up to their initial findings. They're recruiting 500 infants who are also siblings of children with autism for national infant brain imaging study. ""By tracking the behaviors and brain volume growth from birth in high-risk babies, we can pinpoint when the brain first begins to grow larger than normal and provide therapy or medications to limit the growth or symptoms a lot earlier than we are doing now,"" said Piven. Autism is the fastest-growing serious developmental disability in the United States. It's newly diagnosed in 67 children every day. The average age for diagnosis 3.","Study: The amygdala in toddlers with autism is 13 percent larger than unaffected kids .

"(CNN) -- Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear arguments in Elonis v. U.S., a case  that dates back to 2010, when 28-year-old Anthony Elonis was charged with multiple counts of communicating threats after he posted a series of violent messages to Facebook. Although Elonis maintained that many of the posts, which included menacing statements directed at his wife and a female FBI agent, were merely rap lyrics, the jury was unconvinced. He was found guilty on all but one of the counts and was sentenced to 44 months in prison. The Court's primary purpose in taking on Elonis v. U.S. will be to clarify what actually constitutes a ""true threat."" Today, courts across the country are using dramatically different standards: Some argue that subjective intent is important in determining whether something is a threat, while others do not, focusing instead on how a ""reasonable"" person would interpret a message. Since the Supreme Court hasn't addressed this issue directly in over a decade -- a period that has seen the explosion of social media and, with it, a radical shift in the way we communicate -- the time is certainly ripe for a new look. But the timing of Elonis is crucial for another reason. Over this same decade, we have also witnessed the rapid expansion of prosecutors' use of rap lyrics as evidence in criminal proceedings. In the last two years alone, we have served as expert witnesses or consultants in dozens of such cases, and our research suggests there have been hundreds more across the country. Rather than acknowledge rap as a fictional form told in rhymed verse, one that privileges figurative, often hyperbolic, speech delivered by an invented character, prosecutors have become skilled at convincing judges and juries that the lyrics are autobiographical confessions of illegal behavior or evidence of a defendant's motive or intent with respect to an alleged crime. In effect, they have used the judiciary to re-define rap music as something other than art. Given research demonstrating the prejudicial effect that rap, especially violent ""gangsta"" rap, can have on potential jurors, it's no surprise that prosecutors misrepresent the genre in this way. Nor should it come as a surprise that the overwhelming majority of defendants in these cases are young black and Latino men. Rap has always carried the baggage of America's enduring fears about young men of color, even as its history is rooted in a broader hip hop culture that was conceived by many artists as an alternative to violence, a tool to educate, and a pathway to a better life. Without that context, judges and jurors become easy prey for prosecutors who use rap lyrics to secure convictions, often when their cases are weak. There are examples of such cases to be found across the country, but one of the most recent and high profile has been State v. Skinner in New Jersey. The case involves Vonte Skinner, a drug dealer and aspiring rapper who was charged with attempted murder for his alleged involvement in a 2005 shooting. During his 2008 trial, prosecutors introduced as evidence 13 pages of his violent rap lyrics -- even though they were all composed before the shooting (some of them years before) and none contained specific details about the victim or the crime. Despite the paucity of other evidence against Skinner, the jury found him guilty. In 2012, however, an appellate court overturned the verdict, finding that the rap lyrics shouldn't have been admitted as evidence. The justices wrote: ""We have a significant doubt about whether the jurors would have found defendant guilty if they had not been required to listen to the extended reading of these disturbing and highly prejudicial lyrics."" The State appealed the ruling to the Supreme Court of New Jersey, which heard arguments in the case in April and is expected to rule later this year. Unlike Skinner, the Elonis case is in some ways atypical of others we've seen: Elonis himself is white, and unlike many defendants, he shows no sign of aspiring to be a professional rapper. (He claimed to be using rap as a ""therapeutic"" medium through which to vent his frustrations, while his wife said he had not regularly listened to rap music and that she had never seen him write rap lyrics during their seven-year marriage.) In one respect, though, his case is frighteningly typical. Whereas rap is usually used to demonstrate a defendant's involvement in some underlying offense, there is a rapidly growing strain of cases in which rap itself constitutes the crime. As with Elonis, the lyrics, often posted via social media, are treated as threats and prosecuted as such. And jurors who are perfectly ""reasonable"" will convict, even when the defendant is merely following the conventions of a musical genre that, like horror films or gangster novels, shouldn't be confused with reality. At his trial, Elonis claimed that his lyrics were heavily influenced by Eminem, the best selling rapper of all time who rose to fame by pushing the lyrical envelope -- even to the point of fantasizing about killing his wife, not unlike Elonis did when he posted, ""There's one way to love you but a thousand ways to kill you. I'm not going to rest until your body is a mess, soaked in blood and dying from all the little cuts."" Elonis maintained he never intended to act out his lyrics, again echoing Eminem, who made the critical distinction between art and reality when he said, ""I do say things that I think will shock people. But I don't do things to shock people."" When the Supreme Court hears Elonis v. U.S. this fall, arguments are likely to focus on the legal standards used to determine what does and does not constitute a true threat. In a May op-ed, we joined Professor Clay Calvert in urging the Court to take this case to provide clarity to this important area of law. At the same time, we think the justices would be wise to use the Elonis case as an opportunity to address the growing prosecution of rap music specifically. No other fictional form is singled out this way, and if the Court remains silent about it, more people can expect to be imprisoned for their art. If that's not a true threat, then what is?

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Treasury is prohibiting Americans from ""engaging in any transactions"" with three Pakistan-based militants and a front group. The Treasury said Thursday that the move is targeting the financial and support networks of Lashkar-e Tayyiba and Jaish-e Mohammed, two militant groups operating in the Asian subcontinent. The agency cited Azam Cheema, who helped train operatives for the November 2008 Mumbai, India, attacks and was the ""mastermind"" behind the July 2006 Mumbai train bombings carried out by Lashkar-e Tayyiba. Treasury also acted against Hafiz Abdul Rahman Makki, head of Lashkar-e Tayyiba's political affairs department, for acting for or on behalf of the group. Al Rehmat Trust, called an ""an operational front"" for Jaish-e Mohammed, was designated for providing support to and for acting for or on behalf of that group, and Mohammed Masood Azhar Alvi, Jaish-e Mohammed's founder and leader, was designated for acting for on behalf of the group. The move comes ahead of President Barack Obama's trip to Asia, where he will visit the memorial in Mumbai for the attacks this weekend. ""LET and JEM have proven both their willingness and ability to execute attacks against innocent civilians,"" said Stuart Levey, undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence. ""Today's action -- including the designation of Azam Cheema, one of LET's leading commanders who was involved in the 2008 and 2006 Mumbai attacks -- is an important step in incapacitating the operational and financial networks of these deadly organizations."" The United States has designated Jaish-e Mohammed and Lashkar-e Tayyiba as foreign terrorist organizations. The Treasury statement said ""Al Rehmat Trust has provided support for militant activities in Afghanistan and Pakistan, including financial and logistical support to foreign fighters operating in both countries.

"(CNN) -- DNA evidence links Jesse Matthew, a suspect in this month's disappearance of University of Virginia student Hannah Graham, to the death of Virginia Tech student Morgan Harrington, who disappeared in 2009, a law enforcement source told CNN Monday. And state authorities are checking other unsolved homicide and missing person cases for possible connections. Virginia State Police had said earlier that the two cases were connected by a ""forensic link"" but did not elaborate. Almost from the start, speculation was raised about the possibility of a connection between Graham's disappearance and Harrington's death. ""Certainly the question has arisen. It's certainly a legitimate question,"" Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo told reporters last week. In a statement, James L. Camblos III, Matthew's lawyer, said he met with his client for 2Â½ hours Monday but declined further comment. ""Because everything is under seal, I have not been provided with any evidence that links him to either of these cases,"" he said, referring to Graham and Harrington. Matthew will have a bond hearing on Thursday. In addition, authorities said they are studying other unsolved homicide and missing person cases in Virginia: In Campbell County, the sheriff's office is investigating a possible link to the case of Cassandra Morton, whose body was found in a wooded area near Lynchburg in November 2009; in Orange, police are checking for possible ties to the missing person case of Samantha Ann Clarke, who was last seen September 13, 2010; and in Montgomery County, the sheriff's office is looking for possible links to the unsolved 2009 shooting deaths of two Virginia Tech students, Heidi Childs and David Metzler. Harrington was a 20-year-old Virginia Tech student when she went missing after attending a Metallica concert in Charlottesville in October 2009. Her remains were found on a farm months later. No arrests have been made in Harrington's case, and the cause of her death is still under investigation. Parents: 'This person might be involved' in Morgan Harrington's murder . Graham, a student at the University of Virginia, was last seen September 13 in an area of Charlottesville known as the Downtown Mall. Police have asked owners of large parcels of property in surrounding counties to search their land and report back. Authorities are offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to the safe return of Graham, 18, who was a second-year student at the university. Where is Hannah Graham? Investigators say they believe Matthew was the last person with Graham. He is charged with abduction with the intent to defile in the case, according to Charlottesville police. The last major development in the Harrington case came in 2010, when her slaying was connected to the kidnapping and sexual assault of another woman in Fairfax, Virginia, in 2005. That woman, who survived her ordeal, was able to provide police with enough of a description to make a sketch. That sketch is the closest thing to resolution that Harrington's family has had. Police at the time did not give the name of the woman who gave the description and said only that ""forensic evidence"" linked the two. Hannah Graham disappearance suspect questioned in 2002 alleged rape case . The revelation that Matthew may be linked to Harrington's death, and the fact that Harrington's death was linked to the kidnapping and rape of the woman in Fairfax, raises even more questions. Police have not publicly connected the dots except to say that Matthew's arrest has given them a break in the investigation of Harrington's death. Matthew was being held in isolation in a Virginia jail. CNN's Pam Brown and Mary Kay Mallonee contributed to this story .","NEW: Authorities check other unsolved cases for possible ties .

"(CNN) -- Gunmen have kidnapped an American journalist in Syria, the journalist's family announced Wednesday. Freelancer James Foley was taken in northwest Syria on November 22, Thanksgiving Day in America, his family said, adding it decided to make his capture public now in the hope that media attention will increase the odds he'll be released unharmed. ""We want Jim to come safely home, or at least we need to speak with him to know he's OK,"" said the journalist's father, John Foley. ""Jim is an objective journalist and we appeal for the release of Jim unharmed. To the people who have Jim, please contact us so we can work together toward his release."" A Facebook page and a Twitter account have been created for anyone to post messages about Foley. This isn't the first time Foley has been abducted. He was taken along with others in Libya in 2011. He and three other journalists were released by the Libyan military in May 2011. Foley worked for GlobalPost at the time. The news outlet ran a story on its website Wednesday about Foley's abduction in Syria. Syrian war's death toll surpasses 60,000 . Foley communicated with his sister online, via Skype, on Thanksgiving morning, his brother, Michael Foley, told CNN Wednesday. The journalist didn't suggest that he felt he was in any danger during that conversation, he said. James Foley was working on several stories when he was abducted, including one ""on the destruction of the ancient city of Aleppo,"" said his brother, Michael Foley. He added that the family has been working closely with government agencies as well as people in Turkey and Syria. ""Anyone and everyone,"" the brother said. ""One of the reasons we have put the story out there is because we are seeking additional information. The message we want to give is James is an innocent and unbiased journalist and we appeal that he be released unharmed."" Foley's website says he has ""reported independently and objectively from the Middle East for the past five years."" The Foley family has tried over the years to get used to their relative's choice to be a war correspondent. ""It's been an adjustment. It's been something we have been getting around,"" Michael Foley said. ""We have never tried to talk him out of it because he is so passionate about it and he truly wants to shed light on conflict."" The journalist has taken security training for conflict zones and is ""very cautious in what he does,"" Michael Foley said. When his brother was released in Libya, Michael Foley flew to Libya to see him. ""It was an emotional high you cannot describe,"" he said. What's in store for Syria in 2013? The global news agency AFP, which has been using Foley's work since March 2012, released a statement saying that Foley was taken in the northern town of Taftanaz and that no one has claimed responsibility. ""After respecting his family's initial decision to remain silent about the abduction, AFP now fully supports its choice in making the news public and wholeheartedly calls for the journalist's release,"" said AFP CEO Emmanuel Hoog. ""We remain in constant contact with the journalist's family and friends. In addition, we are multiplying contacts and taking every measure in our power to facilitate his release."" ""James is a professional journalist who has remained totally neutral in this conflict. His captors, whoever they may be, must release him immediately,"" he added in a written statement. Opinion: Refugee figures fall short . Foley is familiar with war zones, Hoog said, and the journalist's work ""has considerably enriched coverage of the Syrian conflict."" Foley had contributed about 30 video reports from Syria. Before he became a journalist, Foley's website says, he ""helped empower disadvantaged individuals as a teacher and mentor, assisting them in improving their lives.""

"Istanbul (CNN) -- Turkish protesters are giving their government the silent treatment. Hundreds of men and women stood silently Tuesday in Istanbul's Taksim Square emulating the performance artist whose quiet protest Monday night quickly gained him the nickname ""Standing Man."" For more than five hours, Erdem Gunduz had stared toward a portrait of Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the modern Turkish state, whose likeness adorns the side of the Ataturk Cultural Center in the square. Police eventually moved in to arrest many of those who had joined him, but it was unclear Tuesday whether Gunduz was in custody. His quiet defiance came after police broke up weekend anti-government protests with tear gas and water cannon. Turkey has been wracked by more than two weeks of protests against the government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. But many of those who joined Gunduz said they were standing only for peace, not taking sides. ""I'm standing against all violence,"" said Koray Konuk, one of those arrested. ""I'm standing there so that the events that we've been witnessing and the events taking place over the last two to three weeks can come to a standstill."" Woman labeled 'icon' of Turkey protests: It's not about me . Konuk, 45, told CNN that police put him on a bus with up to 20 other people who had joined Gunduz, but that Gunduz was not among them. ""I was just standing. They arrested a man who was just standing,"" he said. ""That is absurd."" People, alone or in pairs, continued to arrive and stand silently at the square throughout the day Tuesday. Some held hands in a quiet show of solidarity, and a few supporters even took to putting sunscreen on the faces of some protesters. But police once again arrived in large numbers and took the placid protesters away in vans. The hushed tableau came two days after police swept into Taksim Square and neighboring Gezi Park to clear out anti-Erdogan protesters. The demonstrators tried to return to the park Sunday, only to be driven back by police. Tear gas abates, music fills Turkey's Gezi Park . Root of protests . The unrest began in Istanbul in late May, when a small group of people turned out to protest government plans to bulldoze Gezi Park, the city's last green space, and replace it with a shopping mall housed inside a replica of 19th century Ottoman barracks. Protesters said the plans represented a creeping infringement on their rights in a secular society. Turkey was founded after secularists defeated Islamic Ottoman forces in the early 20th century, and many modern-day secularists frown on Ottoman symbols. Soon after the demonstrations began, security forces cracked down on the protesters. Instead of ending the activity, however, the crackdown prompted more people to come out, many calling for political reforms. The unrest also brought political risks for Erdogan, a populist and democratically elected politician serving his third term in office. Speaking Tuesday to a parliamentary group meeting of his Justice and Development (AK) Party, Erdogan said he had no intention of restricting anyone's democratic rights. ""If you want to make a protest do it, do it, but do it within the framework of law,"" he said. He accused the international media of misrepresenting events in Turkey. ""Vandalism (footage) was twisted and displayed as if it was a innocent environmental protest,"" he said. ""International media reported on this in a manner to deceive those who are not acting with them to their side."" He said security forces were being patient, refraining from using guns even when two police officers were wounded by gunfire. ""When their warnings are not heeded, they use tear gas,"" he said. The police will not turn a blind eye to illegal actions, he said, in an apparent reference to the ongoing protests. Erdogan reiterated that the government will abandon its plans to build in Gezi Park if the people of Istanbul vote against them. Erdogan plans to muster a show of support this weekend in the Turkish heartland, where he has a strong base. The prime minister told parliament that rallies will be held on behalf of the Justice and Development Party in Kayseri on Friday, in Samsun on Saturday and in Erzurum on Sunday. Is Istanbul safe for tourists? U.N. concerns . U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay on Tuesday expressed concern about the tactics used by security forces against demonstrators. ""I am particularly concerned about allegations of excessive use of force by police against peaceful groups of protesters as this may have resulted in serious damage to health,"" she said in a statement issued from Geneva. ""Reports that tear gas canisters and pepper spray were fired at people from close range, or into closed spaces, and the alleged misuse of rubber bullets, need to be promptly, effectively, credibly and transparently investigated,"" Pillay said, noting that ""the atmosphere is still clearly highly combustible."" And Human Rights Watch said Monday that the Turkish government's response to weekend protests was excessive. ""The police assault on a peaceful crowd in Gezi Park and tear gas use in confined spaces showed a dangerous disregard for the well-being -- and indeed the lives -- of protesters and bystanders,"" said Emma Sinclair-Webb, senior Turkey researcher for the rights group. ""The repeated police violence against people who are dissatisfied with government policies has deeply polarized Turkey. The government urgently needs to change police tactics and issue a clear signal for restraint."" But Erdogan defended the police approach. ""The police forces have passed the democracy test,"" he said Tuesday, according to the semiofficial Anadolu Agency news service. He described the use of tear gas on protesters as an ""incontestable right of police"" and the demonstrations as ""an unprincipled, immoderate movement that is based on lies and deception,"" Anadolu reported. Trade unions had tried on Monday to put fresh pressure on Erdogan by mounting a nationwide strike. But a crowd that marched on Taksim Square dispersed when faced with riot squads backed by water cannon. Letters from Turkey, with pride . 'There is a level of desperation' While the protests are unlikely to threaten the rule of Erdogan, who is credited with overseeing a decade of economic growth, they are raising questions about what critics say is an increasingly authoritarian style of governing. iReport: Wedding in the midst of teargas . Some demonstrators have shifted to protesting in their local neighborhoods in the city, putting up barricades. Meanwhile, the atmosphere in confrontations between police and protesters is turning uglier. ""Now it feels like there is a level of desperation,"" said Clare Murray, who was vacationing in Istanbul from New York for the past week. ""The police seem more comfortable with using aggression."" Since Saturday night, 116 people have been detained during protests in Ankara and 242 people have been detained in Istanbul demonstrations, said Huseyin Aslan, general secretary of the Progressive Lawyers Association. Erdogan has accused outsiders of taking advantage of the protests over the park.

"(CNN) -- A 6-year-old boy was found dead in the frigid waters of Oregon's Yaquina Bay after his mother told police she threw him off a bridge Monday evening, authorities said. The body of London McCabe was found in the water about a mile from the Yaquina Bay Bridge about 10:20 p.m., roughly four hours after his mother called 911 to say she'd thrown him from the span, Newport police said. The mother, Jillian Meredith McCabe, 34, was arrested on charges of aggravated murder, murder and first-degree manslaughter, police said. McCabe, of nearby Seal Rock, called police around 6:30 p.m. Monday ""saying she threw her child over the side,"" Newport Police Chief Mark Miranda said. The water of Yaquina Bay is more than 100 feet below the bridge. Chances of survival from a fall that high were ""minimal,"" Miranda said. Even if a person survived the fall, the chief said, one could survive the frigid water for only about 20 minutes. Police have not commented on the cause of the boy's death or a possible motive. McCabe was being held at the Lincoln County jail Tuesday morning with bail set at $750,000. Two boats and a Coast Guard helicopter searched the water for hours before the body was found, Coast Guard spokesman Jonathan Klingenberg told CNN. CNN's Greg Morrison and Tina Burnside contributed to this report.","NEW: The mother has been arrested on murder, manslaughter charges .

"(CNN) -- A Florida couple declined to answer the door just before midnight when a nearly naked woman knocked and screamed she had just been raped. Rather, the homeowners called 911 Monday night. The couple inside the home refused to let the woman in because they said they were afraid to open their door. In the 911 call, the woman can be heard pleading in the background. The distressed couple begged police to hurry. Their home is in an isolated area, and the couple feared for their safety if they opened the door. It took about 11 minutes for police to arrive. A subsequent investigation led to an arrest of a suspect and prompted the spokesman of the DeLand Police Department to remark that ""unfortunately fear dictates the response anymore not knowing if (you're) being set up for other criminal activity."" Related: Teens trained to be active bystanders in dating violence . Police spokesman Lt. Jack Waples added that if citizens are uncomfortable opening the door to someone seeking help, ""tell the person to calm down, you are calling 911 now,"" Waples said in a statement. ""If there are two of you, one continues to talk to the victim reassuring them help is on the way while the other person stays on the line with the authorities,"" Waples said. ""You control how you respond. For example, tell the person to back away from the door to a place (you're) comfortable with so you can throw out a blanket or something then go back inside. Always beware of your surroundings around the entry way such as high bushes someone else could be hiding behind. ""Every situation will be unique in its own way and the decision to help is up to the individual depending on how much they can do to assist,"" Waples said. Juan L. Vera-Soledad, 29, of DeLand was arrested in the incident and charged with kidnapping and sex battery with a weapon, according to a charging affidavit filed by police. Vera-Soledad was in custody Thursday, and it wasn't immediately clear whether he had an attorney. The incident began late Monday night when the woman was forced at knifepoint to enter a man's car at a Citgo in DeLand, a police affidavit said. The motorist had been circling her several times in his 1998 four-door Toyota and then stopped his car and asked her to get in, the police report said. The man then got out of his car and revealed a silver switchblade-style knife, forcing her into the passenger seat, police said. He then drove to a location and raped the woman repeatedly, the police document said. When the man ""then laid down in the backseat as if to take a break for a couple of minutes,"" the woman sat up, elbowed him in the chest, grabbed her pink shorts and fled to the residence, the document said. The homeowner told police that ""he heard someone outside banging on his front door yelling that she had been raped,"" the affidavit said. Responding officers then searched for the suspect and found him with a ""known prostitute"" in his car, the report said.

"(CNN) -- Nine days after her same-sex wedding, a 28-year-old Michigan woman was set upon on her way home from work, knocked unconscious by three men who kicked and punched her while shouting anti-gay epithets. ""Hey b----, aren't you that f----- from the news?"" one of the men asked, according to police. The assailants in Monday's assault recognized her from local TV news coverage of her wedding, said Derrick Jackson, a spokesman for the Washtenaw County Sheriff's Office. She and her partner were among the many gay and lesbian couples to recently make their unions official after a federal court struck down a Michigan amendment restricting marriage to one man and one woman. The victim, who doesn't want to be identified, got herself to a hospital with significant bruising and swelling to the right side of her face as well as her torso and arm, Jackson said. Police in Washtenaw County -- about 30 miles west of Detroit -- were looking for the attackers. In many states, hate crime charges could be brought in such cases, but Michigan is one of 19 states that do not include sexual orientation in their hate crime laws, according to Sarah Warbelow, state legislative director for the Washington-based Human Rights Campaign, a national lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender advocacy group. Michigan's hate crime law, known as the ethnic intimidation statute, protects people against crimes based on their ""race, color, religion, gender, or national origin."" But Michigan prosecutors acknowledge the law is inadequate, and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) advocates agree. ""People on the other side of this issue tend to think of it as the LGBT community looking for a special right,"" said Yvonne Siferd, director of victim services for Equality Michigan, a statewide LGBT anti-violence and advocacy organization. ""It's not a special right to walk down the street holding the hand of people you love and not be attacked."" For more than two decades, advocacy groups have been pushing for states to adopt hate crime laws to include the LGBT community or expand existing laws to do so, according to the Human Rights Campaign. The laws would impose stricter sentences, increase accountability on assailants and broaden crimes to include hate crimes against property. The District of Columbia was the first jurisdiction to include sexual orientation and gender identity in hate crime laws in 1989, according to Warbelow. In 2001 and 2002, she said, advocates pushed for states to specifically protect the LGBT community in hate crime laws. The clamor was a direct response to the case of Matthew Shepard, a gay teenager who died after being tied to a fence in Wyoming and beaten in 1998. In 2009, President Barack Obama signed into law The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Hate Crimes Prevention Act, making hate crimes a federal offense in an attempt to protect members of the nation's LGBT community and other groups from bias-motivated violence. Advocates hailed the federal law's passage as a step in the right direction, but legislators appear to have abandoned efforts to expand it on a state level. ""Legislators have it stuck in their head that because it's a federal law, they don't have to pass it on a state level,"" Warbelow told CNN. ""But there is a limited number of money the feds have to investigate hate crimes. It is much more ideal for states to have mechanisms to take on hate crime themselves."" The first effort at expanding Michigan's ethnic intimidation statute dates back to 1997, according to Ari Adler, press secretary for Michigan state house speaker Jase Bolger. But opponents have said that expanding the statute would make gays and lesbians a special class of citizens and signal that crimes against the LGBT community are more serious than those committed against heterosexuals, according to the state legislature's Journal of the House. Chris Kolb, Michigan's first openly gay state legislator, was the primary sponsor of the bill expansion in 2001. He said the opposition reflected a basic lack of education about gay rights, the philosophy that you shouldn't add an additional penalty to a crime, and the fact that some people did not want to give special recognition to the LGBT community. ""There are still glaring gaps in the laws that generally protect people,"" said Kolb, a former state representative who now heads an organization called the Michigan Environmental Council. ""Hate crimes, while they may be committed against an individual person, are aimed at the entire group of people they represent -- that's why they are different than just a crime,"" he said. ""They are sending a message to a group of people."" Michigan police officers are required to record data and report information for reported crimes, including whether sexual orientation was a factor, according to Warbelow. But prosecutors can't bring charges beyond the actual assault. ""The federal government ... wanted to see how much of a problem hate crimes were,"" Warbelow said. ""The difference was the government took the data and said it was a problem and changed the law. Michigan has not."" Washtenaw County police say they don't have any reason to believe the 28-year-old Michigan woman attacked on her way home is not credible. Police have no leads at this time. She told police she believes the prior publicity contributed to the attack. The police investigation continues, and whatever evidence is gathered will be turned over to prosecutors. Steven Hiller, chief assistant prosecutor for Washtenaw County, said prosecutors could contact U.S. attorneys if they determine that federal law is applicable. ""If the motivation for the crime was a person's sexual orientation, it just doesn't fall within the ethnic intimidation statute,"" he said. Hiller added, ""It is not an unheard-of situation for our office to contact the U.S. attorney in appropriate circumstances to look at a particular case if federal law addresses a situation better than state law does.""

"Washington (CNN) -- A 9-year-old boy's request to have Israel listed as the place of birth on his U.S. passport was supported by the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday. Menachem Zivotofsky was born in Jerusalem, a disputed region in the eyes of the Obama administration, which claimed the larger issue should be resolved by bilateral negotiations, not by a 2002 federal law favoring the family and 50,000 other Americans born in the holy city. The Justice Department urged the courts to stay out of the matter. But the justices by an 8-1 vote said the courts could intervene and decide the matter. That jurisdictional barrier is now overcome and the family can continue to pursue their legal claims. The case is a classic fight between congressional and executive authority, with foreign policy the source of the current controversy. At issue before the high court were two questions, one narrow, one broad: Can courts intervene to enforce a federal law explicitly directing the State Department how to record the birthplace of an American citizen on a passport? And does the law impermissibly infringe on the president's power to recognize a foreign sovereign? ""There have been 50,000 Americans in the last 10 years that were born in Jerusalem, and many of them would like to have Israel indicated as their place of birth in the passports,"" Sarah Cleveland, a Columbia University Law School professor, and until recently a counselor on international law at the State Department, said in November. ""But this is also an extremely important geopolitical issue and a very sensitive foreign relations issue for the United States."" The high court case was Zivotofsky v. Clinton, but the key player in this dispute is perhaps the most famous city in the world, and one of the oldest human settlements still in existence: Jerusalem. Its name translates as ""City of Peace"" to some, ""Holy Sanctuary"" to others. It is Israel's largest city and its capital, though that is not recognized by the United Nations and most of the world community. The city is home to Ari and Naomi Zivotofsky. The couple and their two oldest children were born in the United States, but the family migrated to West Jerusalem a decade ago, and in 2002 the youngest, Menachem Binyamin, was born. ""We're very proud of the fact that he was born in Israel and that we live in Israel and it's the modern state of Israel,"" Ari Zivotofsky told CNN Correspondent Kate Bolduan last year. ""Religiously and historically, that's very significant."" Just three weeks before Menachem was born, the United States Congress gave U.S. citizens born in Jerusalem the individual discretion to ask that Israel be listed on passports and consular reports, where it says ""Place of Birth."" President George W. Bush signed the bill, but issued an executive ""signing statement"" indicating he would not comply. The law, he said ""impermissibly interferes with the president's constitutional authority to conduct the nation's foreign affairs and to supervise the unitary executive branch."" That law, and the Zivotofsky's long-standing request, were at the center of the 70-minute arguments before the justices in November. ""They're both proud American citizens but feel a very strong affinity, religiously too, to the state of Israel,"" said Alyza Lewin, the Zivotofsky's Washington-based lawyer, last year. ""Their son is very proud of the fact that he is the one sibling born in Israel."" It is not the first time the Congress and White House have clashed over the region. The U.S. Embassy remains in Tel Aviv, over U.S. lawmakers' objections. The boy's mother made the ""Israel"" request about two months after his birth, but embassy officials refused. His passport in fact shows his round, innocent face, and ""Jerusalem"" is listed as his place of birth. ""That's been the State Department's practice, the general rule for American citizens born abroad is that their passport lists only a country of birth,"" said Lewin in November. ""So if a citizen is born for instance in Paris, it says France. If they're born in Tel Aviv or Haifa, it says just Israel. If you're born in Jerusalem, instead of saying the country, the city is listed -- just a city -- Jerusalem."" The attorneys for the Zivotofskys have framed their case as a modest request, one that does not implicate the president's foreign policy power. They are asking the high court not to decide a political question, but simply tell the administration to enforce the law, for the sake of a little boy. ""It is a very personal case. What's at stake is their deep personal pride and sense of identification with the state of Israel, and their right, given by Congress, to express that, on the passport,"" said attorney Nathan Lewin, who argued the family's case before the high court in November. ""That pride, and the national pride of others, is clearly what makes that region as much front page news as it often is. But I don't think that this case itself is asking for any kind of broader determination than allowing these individuals that opportunity. Congress has recognized that it's part of his self respect, that he should be able to say Israel, and that's all that we're asking for in this case."" The government is thinking of the bigger picture. State Department officials would not comment on the record on a pending case, but President Barack Obama has acknowledged the stalled peace process has created divisions both in that region and in the United States. ""Palestinians should know the territorial outlines of their state; Israelis should know that their basic security concerns will be met,"" he said in a May 2010 speech. ""I know that these steps alone will not resolve this conflict. Two wrenching and emotional issues remain: the future of Jerusalem, and the fate of Palestinian refugees. But moving forward now on the basis of territory and security provides a foundation to resolve those two issues in a way that is just and fair, and that respects the rights and aspirations of Israelis and Palestinians."" Choosing a home, and being able to decide what to call it may seem like a fundamental right. But nothing is so easy when Jerusalem is mentioned. The Zivotofskys say they recognize the geo-political complexity, but think in this case, in this judicial forum, the solution is simple. ""Everybody knows Jerusalem is in Israel. Why is the State Department refusing to recognize this?"" said Nathan Lewin. ""They have this fear of nonexistent hobgoblins, which has caused them to follow this policy, and it's about time -- Congress thought it was about time -- they get rid of that policy ... all that we're asking the Supreme Court to do is agree with Congress, that this is a foolish policy, and ought to be eliminated.""","Menachem Zivotofsky wants to list Israel as his birthplace on his U.S. passport .

"(CNN) -- Less than nine months after she shoved her husband off a steep cliff just days into their marriage, a federal judge sentenced Jordan Linn Graham to 30 years in prison Thursday. Graham, 22, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in December, admitting to luring her new husband, Cody Johnson, to Glacier National Park and pushing him off a cliff. ""After providing several false statements to law enforcement officers and impeding the investigation by providing false information, Graham ultimately admitted pushing Cody from behind with both hands,"" prosecutors said in a statement Thursday. Graham filed a motion to withdraw her guilty plea on Wednesday, arguing that prosecutors had negotiated the plea deal in bad faith by pushing the judge toward a harsher sentence despite agreeing to drop a first-degree murder charge. Prosecutors denied that claim and argued that Graham was trying to delay sentencing. U.S. District Judge Donald Molloy denied Graham's motion to withdraw her guilty plea at Thursday's hearing, accepting the plea deal and sentencing her to 365 months in prison. The judge's ruling came after several members of Johnson's family asked the judge to sentence Graham to life in prison, CNN affiliate KPAX reported. The sentencing comes months after Graham's surprise guilty plea in the middle of the high-profile murder trial. ""It was a reckless act,"" Graham told the judge in December. ""I just pushed."" When Graham declared her guilt, the victim's mother in the gallery crumpled in her seat. Another relative of Johnson, who was 25, threw her head back and cried, whispering ""she said guilty."" His friends held hands and appeared satisfied. When the judge first asked what happened the day her husband was killed, Graham responded, ""I wasn't thinking of where we were."" Then she spoke of a deadly argument at the park and how she had misgivings about the marriage. ""I wasn't really happy,"" she said. Before her guilty plea, Graham's defense lawyers had argued that the death plunge was an accident resulting from an argument. Graham initially lied to police, they said, because she was afraid she wouldn't be allowed to explain what happened on the cliff's edge. CNN's Michael Martinez, Kyung Lah and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","A judge sentences Jordan Linn Graham to 30 years in prison .

"New York (CNN) -- The dispute surrounding a student vacation flight from New York to Atlanta is getting uglier. One hundred one students and eight chaperones were kicked off an early morning AirTran flight before its scheduled departure Monday. The controversy now pits the airline against an Orthodox Jewish high school. ""We take this matter seriously and have started our own investigation,"" said a statement released Tuesday by Rabbi Seth Linfield, executive director of the Yeshiva of Flatbush school. ""Preliminarily, it does not appear that the action taken by the flight crew was justified."" From the airline's perspective, it sounds like a large-scale version of the parental ""don't-make-me-turn-this-car-around"" scenario. Southwest, which owns AirTran, said the group of ""non-compliant passengers"" would not stay seated, and some were using their mobile devices after being asked not to. When the students failed to comply with requests from the flight crew, including the captain, they were asked to leave the plane, delaying the AirTran flight for 45 minutes, said Southwest spokesman Brad Hawkins. Southwest Airlines acquired AirTran in a deal announced three years ago. Students and chaperones from the Brooklyn-based school said the flight crew overreacted to the teenagers who were looking forward to visiting Six Flags and rafting, among other activities. ""It blew out of proportion. It was a mountain out of a molehill,"" said teacher Marian Wielgus, one of the chaperones. According to Wielgus, some students may have had to be told twice to sit down or turn off their phones, but everyone listened. ""They certainly did not do what the stewardess was claiming they did,"" she said. ""That's what was so bizarre."" Travelers take aim at kids on a plane . Wielgus said the flight attendants were ""nasty,"" ""overreacting"" and ""created an incident when there didn't have to be one."" According to Southwest Airlines, the group violated safety regulations. Wielgus said she would understand if individual students who were not complying had been asked to leave, but she objected to the collective punishment. Wielgus said a ""small group"" of students in the back of the aircraft were chatty, but that did not warrant the flight crew to force an entire group of 109 people off the plane. ""It was so ugly,"" she said. Rabbi Joseph Beyda, another chaperone, said none of the students on the plane was particularly loud or disruptive. And when he saw that the flight attendant was flustered and had asked students to leave, he asked which kids were causing issues and offered to help, but she refused. ""They just simply said 'get off the plane,'"" Beyda said. Beyda's Twitter account included a joking photo of the class labeled ""whitewater rafting in Milwaukee!!"" It's not clear when it was taken, but some of the students did have a layover in Milwaukee after they were put on other flights. Student Jonathan Zehavi said he felt they were targeted because they are an identifiably Jewish group. ""They treated us like we were terrorists; I've never seen anything like it. I'm not someone to make these kinds of statements,"" Zehavi said. ""I think if it was a group of non-religious kids, the air stewardess wouldn't have dared to kick them off."" Zehavi said Southwest Airlines is attempting to cover up an unprofessional and rash decision by saying their group was not cooperating with the crew, when in fact they were, he said. Kid-free 'Quiet Zones' launched on airline . ""It was 4 o'clock in the morning. The last thing any of us wanted to do was get up and make a mess,"" Zehavi said. But business passenger Brad Rinschler, who takes the commuter flight three times a month, said he saw ""definitely less than eight"" chaperones with the students. He saw only two adults walk off the plane with the kids. And the chaperones sat in the front of the plane, while the noisy students sat in the back. Rinschler sat in business class, he said. He said about 10 of the more than 100 students didn't listen to the flight crew's instructions and were noisy, swapping seats to sit beside friends and using their cell phones. ""They were laughing at them and ignoring them,"" Rinschler said of the 10 students. The crew gave the students ""multiple chances"" to heed preflight instructions. ""The pilot warned them. They did not comply. They thought it was a joke. You know, it wasn't a joke,"" Rinschler said. ""I've never seen this,"" he added. ""It's a commuter flight. There's no families on it."" Rinschler didn't witness any anti-Semitic events. ""Absolutely not,"" he said. ""There was not one ethnic slur from anyone on the flight crew or anyone who was inconvenienced for two hours. ""If they were adults, they wouldn't have even had that many chances. That's the bottom line,"" Rinschler said. How to behave on an airplane . One chaperone pleaded with the pilot and security for another chance. ""One chaperone â€” not two, not eight â€” one talked to them asking for a second chance. The pilot said, 'You had a second chance, you had a third chance. There's other people; we have to go. It's not stopping,' "" Rinschler said. Another student in the group, Michael Mamiye, said he was one of the first to be kicked off the plane. He said a flight attendant did not give him a chance to turn off his cell phone before asking him to ""get off the plane."" The same flight attendant then told the captain that the students were ""making trouble"" and not turning off their phones, he added. The captain didn't come out of the cockpit until the last second when he asked the group to leave, Mamiye said. According to Mamiye, he and his classmates were quiet and were sitting down as they were told. And when they were asked to leave, they left in a respectful and orderly fashion. ""We were more behaved than kids should be,"" he said. Both Beyda and Mamiye said the airline's customer service did its best to accommodate the group by getting them on the next available flights. But the group had to be split up and they were in transit for a total of 12 hours, Mamiye said. Boy, 11, hops plane to Rome without ticket or passport .

"(CNN) -- Just when you think derogatory stereotypes about dads are on the decline as fathers take a more hands-on role in child-rearing, along comes an online posting by a major brand that shows not everyone got the memo. And this one -- published, then pulled, by Clorox -- charts new terrain in depicting first-time fathers as clueless buffoons. ""Saying 'No-no' is not just for baby. Like dogs or other house pets, new dads are filled with good intentions but lacking the judgment and fine motor skills to execute well,"" it reads. Somehow, it manages to get even more offensive from there. The list of ""6 mistakes new dads make"" begins with a father taking his child for a walk in ""a cold, brisk, rain-soaked stroller"" and only after 10 minutes beginning to wonder ""why is this baby crying so much?"" At that point, he notices his child is wearing ""a short-sleeved summer onesie."" He's also likely to put his child's clothes on backwards and not understand why they fit wrong. He lets baby eat off the floor -- so, the web post cautions, ""At least get him to enforce a 5-second rule."" He fails to notice the food -- or, worse, Play-Doh -- all over his baby's face, let alone wipe it off. Then he gives his child inappropriate screen time, plopping the baby down in front of ""reality shows."" Parental outcry led Clorox to reexamine the wisdom of the post. The company pulled the page from its website, but did not post a statement in response to the uproar. When I asked for comment, the company sent me this brief statement: ""This article was written by a dad for other dads to make a lighthearted comparison between bachelor lives and new parent lives. We took the article down based on feedback and we know how seriously dads take their parental responsibilities."" The post included some classic insults: ""Prudence won't stop Daddy from relaxing with a brew and blaring inappropriate shows while baby stares in horror/awe/wonder at the colorful moving yell-box. Tell Dad to embrace parental sacrifice and crack a book."" Finally, to top off this glorious work of wisdom and respect, the post states, ""Some new dads have been inspired by raunchy comedies to bring babies to inappropriate places like casinos, pool halls, and poetry readings."" Yes, you read that correctly. Poetry readings. Well, at least it's clear where Clorox got the inspiration for these stereotypes: fiction. ""None of these places are healthy for baby,"" the post continues. ""If dad needs persuading, just tell him that babies are terrible tippers and can never make bank shots."" Wow. So, to summarize, new dads give our kids dirty food and Play-Doh to spread all over their faces while watching ""Kardashians,"" then put them in backward summer clothes in freezing weather, oblivious to their cries en route to a poetry slam. But you can't blame us, because of our perpetually beer-soaked state and canine-level motor skills. Dads and moms wasted no time giving Clorox a piece of their minds. ""This may be the dumbest thing I've ever read,"" David Livorne Hershey wrote on Facebook. ""Me want to comment but me two dum,"" wrote Ariel Isenberg. Tony Hernandez called it ""beyond unacceptable,"" and asked how anyone at Clorox thought ""depicting dads in this manner would be received in a positive light."" ""As a woman, a single mother, and a feminist, I find this 'article' disturbing on so many levels,"" wrote Jocelyn Peskin. ""Perpetuating unfounded gender stereotypes is deplorable and insulting. Always."" Chad Welch inquired about a job, saying that since he's been primary caregiver to his boys for 13 years, he must be ""one of the smartest men you might ever meet."" Dad bloggers had a field day. James Zahn of therockfather.com said he generally steers clear of complaints about portrayals of dads, but this was ""over the top."" ""If Clorox were to assign the same '6 Mistakes' to any other sex, race, or group -- there would be major hell to pay,"" he wrote. Chris Routly at daddydoctrines.com envisioned dads saying, ""I would complain to Clorox about that thing, but I'm too busy betting on red. The baby loves it when I bet on red!"" It's not the first time an insulting depiction of dads comes from a dad. Last year, Huggies took action after an ad infuriated people. Part of the company's response was a Facebook post from a father, using his first name only, who said he was responsible for the ad. Clorox did not say who wrote this ""6 mistakes"" piece, who approved it for the website, or whether officials have any assessment of it now. In an e-mail exchange, spokeswoman Rita Gorenberg said it was ""a piece of web content written by a freelance humor writer who helps us on a number of projects. ... We have enormous respect for parents, moms and dads, as they make their way through the early years of parenting. We're in new territory with today's modern families and changing family roles and we appreciate all feedback to help us get it right."" Chris Routly says this one web page does not reflect Clorox's actions in general. ""I know you know better because I've seen the carefully crafted ads that you've produced that try to recognize dads as user of your products, who might be goofy, but at least aren't idiots,"" he wrote in an open message to Clorox on his blog. ""I've seen you engage with some of the brightest voices in the dad-sphere on campaigns that seek to include dads into the picture in a positive way. I know you know better because you are a company made up of people who are moms and dads that know better what modern families look like."" Some people argue that dads, and people of all groups, need to lighten up about stereotypes in general. ""The problem these days is everyone has lost their sense of humor,"" Christine Lee wrote on Huggies' Facebook page last year. But others say the stereotypes send bad messages to boys and girls, and contribute to assumptions made in society and the court system that dads aren't as good caregivers as mothers. As far as angry parents are concerned, this ""6 mistakes"" post boils down to one big one by Clorox. Update: After this story published, Clorox published a note on Facebook saying that the post was actually an effort to ""poke fun at the caricature of 'the hapless dad.'"" However, there was no suggestion in the piece that it was making fun of a caricature, and Clorox did not say that when I asked about the piece. The Facebook note says, ""To some of you it didn't come across that way and we apologize."" What do you think?

"(CNN) -- One word could have a big impact on the way doctors treat obesity in the United States. The American Medical Association has adopted a new policy that officially labels obesity as a disease ""requiring a range of medical interventions to advance obesity treatment and prevention,"" according to an AMA statement. The physicians' group voted to approve the obesity policy, among others, on Tuesday during its annual meeting in Chicago. The U.S. obesity rate increased almost 50% between 1997 and 2012, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Today, nearly 30% of American adults are considered obese, and the problem is almost as prevalent in kids. Childhood obesity has more than doubled in the past 30 years, the CDC says. Obesity for adults is defined as having a body mass index, or BMI, of 30 or higher. BMI is a way to measure body fat based on your weight and height. (Calculate your BMI here) Being obese increases your risk factor for developing many serious conditions, including heart disease, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke, liver disease, sleep apnea and osteoarthritis. In fact, obesity has been linked to almost every chronic disease in some way or another. ""Recognizing obesity as a disease will help change the way the medical community tackles this complex issue,"" AMA board member Dr. Patrice Harris said in a statement. Obesity has long been recognized as a disease by other groups, but this move by the AMA sends a strong signal to the medical community, said CNN chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta. Some experts worry suddenly declaring one-third of Americans ""ill"" or ""sick"" will increase the desire for quick interventions or medications and discourage people from making the lifestyle changes known to combat obesity. On the other hand, AMA's declaration could help increase funding for future obesity research. It could also lead to payment for doctors who want to simply talk to patients about nutrition or exercise -- time that's not currently reimbursed by insurance plans. Identifying obesity as a disease may also help in reducing the stigma often associated with being overweight, said Joe Nadglowski, president and CEO of the Obesity Action Coalition. ""Obesity has been considered for a long time to be a failure of personal responsibility -- a simple problem of eating too much and exercising too little,"" he said. ""But it's a complex disease... we're hoping attitudes will change."" Nadglowski thinks the AMA's support is also an important step in helping people gain access to obesity treatment. Most forms of insurance do not cover obesity alone. For instance, an obese patient cannot hire a nutritionist or a trainer and have it covered by his or her plan simply to lose weight. ""We do cover treatment connected with a co-morbidity,"" says Don McLeod, a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. ""For example, if you have diabetes and obesity is aggravating the diabetes, we might cover obesity treatment as a way of treating the diabetes."" Obesity-related health care expenses cost Americans between $147 billion to $210 billion per year. Preventing and treating obesity before it leads to more serious diseases could help combat these costs, Nadglowski says. AMA's decision comes at an interesting time. The Obesity Action Coalition has been working to introduce the Treat and Reduce Obesity Act in Congress. The bill was re-introduced in the House on Wednesday and will be re-introduced in the Senate on Wednesday afternoon, according to the office of Sen. Tom Carper, D-Delaware, one of the measure's sponsors. A similar bill last year stalled in committee. The bill would increase obesity treatment options for Medicare patients, expand the types of providers who can offer obesity counseling and take away some obesity medication limits.","The American Medical Association adopts a new policy on obesity .

"(CNN) -- It's being called the most expensive divorce in the history of ... well, marriage. Russia's Dmitry Rybolovlev, 47, earned the dubious honor when Geneva, Switzerland's Court of First Instance last week ordered the 47-year-old billionaire to pay his wife, Elena, about 4 billion Swiss francs, according to CNN's French affiliate BFM. That's a little more than $4.5 billion (little being a relative term). The couple was married for 23 years but have been engaged in divorce proceedings since 2008, BFM reported, citing the Swiss daily newspaper Le Temps. Rybolovlev, who owns the French soccer team AS Monaco, which finished second in Ligue 1 this season, is No. 148 on Forbes' list of billionaires. His estimated worth is $8.8 billion, according to Forbes. Known lately for real estate moves -- including the purchases of a $300 million penthouse in Monaco and a $98 million Palm Beach, Florida, mansion owned by Donald Trump, along with his daughter's purchases of an $88 million New York apartment and the Greek island of Skorpios -- Rybolovlev made his original fortune in fertilizer, according to Forbes. He and his father, a scientist, started their business in 1990, and Rybolovlev began buying shares of industrial enterprises in 1992, Forbes reported. In 1995, he was named chairman of the board of Uralkali, Russia's top producer of potassium fertilizers, Forbes said. He sold his stake in Uralkali for $6.5 billion in 2010 and procured a controlling stake in AS Monaco the following year. The divorce puts Rybolovlev in rarefied company, as only French businessman and art dealer Alec Wildenstein and Bernie Ecclestone, the top dog in Formula One racing, have been reported to shell out more than $1 billion in divorce proceedings. 11 intriguing things owned by wealthy Russians .

"(CNN) -- ""Flappy Bird"" has flown the coop. The addictive game that soared to the top of iPhone and Android app downloads disappeared from app stores on Sunday, though players who already have it apparently can keep on flying. A tweet from the game's creator suggested that its sudden success had become an albatross. ""I am sorry 'Flappy Bird' users, 22 hours from now, I will take 'Flappy Bird' down,"" developer Dong Nguyen wrote on Saturday. ""I cannot take this anymore."" Nguyen, a Vietnamese developer with a studio called DotGears, did not reply to CNN's request for an interview last week and has stayed mostly quiet in the wake of the game's recent and sudden success. He gave an interview Monday to Forbes in which he said the game was conceived as a fun way to kill a few minutes but became ""an addictive product. I think it has become a problem."" The game, he added, is ""gone forever."" ""Flappy Bird"" gives players a chance to steer a tiny bird through a difficult obstacle course of metal pipes. But it's unclear why it shot to the top of the most downloaded charts. Although new players can no longer download ""Flappy Bird,"" the game remains playable for those who had already added it to their devices. Hundreds of phones with ""Flappy Bird"" installed have suddenly appeared for sale on eBay at hugely inflated prices. ""Flappy Bird"" was originally released for the iPhone in May but didn't become the top free iPhone app until mid-January, following a surge in popularity that seems to have kicked off in early December. Observers have voiced several unproven theories about the game's sudden success, including the use of bots to get it on Top 10 lists artificially, organic enthusiasm on social media and a surge in amusing user reviews in the Apple App and Google Play stores. Nguyen told Chocolate Lab Apps he created the game in two to three days and says he did not promote the app in any way after its release. In a series of Twitter posts Saturday, he said he wouldn't sell ""Flappy Bird"" and would continue to make games. ""It is not anything related to legal issues,"" he said. ""I just cannot keep it anymore."" Last week, ""Flappy Bird"" had an average four-star rating from more than 543,000 reviews in the Apple App Store and 228,000 on Android. Many of the reviews were lengthy, tongue-in-cheek tales of time lost, marriages ended and people going cuckoo after playing the game.

"(CNN) -- The fat lady didn't sing on ""Louie,"" but she delivered one hell of a speech -- it's stirring debate. A recent episode of Louis C.K.'s hit FX series involved the comedian grappling with the idea of dating an overweight woman, played by actress Sarah Baker. At one point late in the episode, Baker's character delivers a seven-minute speech that Jezebel called ""absolutely magnificent."" The character Vanessa both berates Louis and laments the difficulties of dating as a plus-size woman -- though she's not one to use euphemisms. ""On behalf of all the fat girls, I'm making you represent all the guys,"" she says. ""Why do you hate us so much? What is it about the basics of human happiness, feeling attractive, feeling loved, having guys chase after us, that's just not in the cards for us? Nope. Not for us."" (Warning: The following video contains explicit language.) It's the usual uncomfortable style for Louis C.K., who writes for and stars in the show that bears his name. The comic is known for making audiences feel queasy even as he has them laughing. Forbes called the scene ""The Year's Most Brutally Honest Seven Minutes Of Television."" ""As brilliant as the speech is, and as brilliant as Baker's performance is, what makes this work is Louie's willingness to just stand there and take it,"" Forbes contributor Allen St. John writes. ""He makes a few lame gestures in self-defense, but even if Vanessa largely refuses to judge him, we don't. Louie is a jerk."" Baker told EW she thought the scene ""was so beautifully written."" ""My interpretation of it was that she's (telling Louie), 'You saying, ""You're not fat,"" is like saying, 'The worst thing a woman can be is fat, so I'm not gonna call you that,' "" Baker said. ""Whereas she's kinda like, 'Yeah, I'm fat. You know, I'm nice, I'm funny, I'm cute -- so who cares?' "" Writing for the A.V. Club, Libby Hill applauded Louis C.K. for starting the conversation. ""No matter how sad it may be that the only way many will start to understand this maligned populace is if a white guy explains it to them, the fact remains that through the platform of his critically acclaimed show, Louis C.K. has given voice to the fat girl,"" she writes. But not everyone is a fan. Writer Dan Weiss explored the episode for The Concourse, noting that ""there's zero representation for actual FAs ('fat admirers,' which is admittedly a voyeuristic term; I prefer the classic 'chubby chaser') on TV."" ""What's despicable about television isn't that it's not depicting enough happily-ever-after fantasies showing underdogs hitting the jackpot -- it's that real life is actually better than these depictions,"" Weiss writes. ""Vanessa would have far less trouble getting someone to hold her hand in real life, and while this was every bit the excellent, conversation-starting Louie episode it's being touted as, is its creator, or anyone else in the TV bubble, actually aware of that fact? "" What do you think? Is too big a deal being made over the ""Fat Girl"" episode or not?","The show takes on the issue of plus-size women dating .

"(CNN) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin bears at least some responsibility for the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Friday. ""I think if there were any doubt it should be gone by now, that Vladimir Putin, certainly indirectly -- through his support of the insurgents in eastern Ukraine and the supply of advanced weapons and, frankly, the presence of Russian Special Forces and intelligence agents -- bears responsibility for what happened,"" she told CNN's Fareed Zakaria in an exclusive interview that will air Sunday. Clinton's comments come just over a week since Flight MH17 crashed in eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 on board. Pro-Russian militants have been accused of downing the plane using Russia-supplied armaments and of interfering with the subsequent investigation at the crash site. Who are Ukraine's pro-Russia rebels? U.S. President Barack Obama last week called the crash a ""wake-up call for Europe and the world that there are consequences to an escalating conflict in eastern Ukraine,"" a view Clinton echoed in urging Europe to go further. ""We have to up the sanctions that are required. The United States has continued to move forward on that, Europe has been reluctant,"" Clinton told. ""They need to understand they must stand up to Vladimir Putin."" Her comments came as the Pentagon warned that Russia is preparing to transfer more powerful weaponry into Ukraine, a move it said could happen at any time. Putin has argued that Ukraine bears significant responsibility, saying in a statement that if military operations had not resumed in eastern Ukraine on June 28, ""this tragedy probably could have been avoided."" However, Clinton joined a chorus of Western voices laying much of the blame at Moscow's door, and she lamented that the United States and Europe had been ""disabused"" of their earlier hopes over the so-called reset in U.S.-Russia relations that was announced during President Obama's first year in office. ""He [Putin] has a strategic plan in mind, the Eurasian Union, which would be in competition to Europe,"" Clinton said. ""His continuing efforts to intimidate Europeans -- not just through energy, but through interfering in elections, putting money behind buying press outlets in European countries ... trying to discourage countries like Ukraine being able to join the European Union."" How rebels in Ukraine built up an arsenal capable of reaching the skies . ""And if the United States and Europe don't present a united front, I think Putin is the kind of man who will go as far as he can get away with. I think he is still smart enough and cautious enough to be pushed back. But there has to be a push in order to make that happen."" 'He's a very arrogant person to deal with' Clinton also shared her thoughts on her interactions with Putin during her stint as Obama's secretary of state. ""He's very tough. He's a very arrogant person to deal with, which I think is a combination of this vision of Russia and some fundamental insecurity, because when you are dealing with him, he often acts as though he could care less,"" Clinton said. ""...There was a G20 summit in Los Cabos (Mexico, in 2012) and our President had a meeting scheduled. He kept President Obama waiting 40 minutes before he showed up. He sat down. It was a very small meeting on both sides of the table. We, at the time, were very hopeful -- not realistically so, but idealistically so -- that we could get more cooperation from Russia to slow down (Bashar) al-Assad and what he was doing in Syria,"" she said. ""Putin could not have looked more bored, more discomfited, and never apologized for being late."" ""So then, of course, he wanted a summit in Russia. He wanted to play the host. And my advice to the president was don't go chasing after him. We're not sure of what his real intent is."" Opinion: Putin, just evil enough . Has Israel committed war crimes? In a wide-ranging interview, Clinton also discussed the ongoing violence in Gaza as Israel's ground incursion entered its second week. Asked about the warning Wednesday by U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay that war crimes may have been committed, and whether Israel has used excessive force, Clinton said she did not agree with the war crimes assessment. ""I think that the Israelis are in a very difficult position. Hamas, we know, embeds missiles, embeds command-and-control units in civilian areas,"" she said. ""Now, some of that is just the geography. It's a very small area, very densely populated. But some of that is a deliberate choice by Hamas."" However, she said, ""too many people have died and too many of them are clearly innocent civilians, even children."" Opinion: War crimes in Gaza conflict? Let court decide . More than 800 people have been killed in the more than two weeks of violence in Gaza, as diplomats scramble to establish a ceasefire. Palestinian leaders called for a day of rage as protests erupted in the West Bank following a strike this week on a U.N. shelter. Israel's security cabinet on Friday unanimously rejected a proposed one-week humanitarian ceasefire, Israeli Intelligence Minister Yuval Steinitz told CNN. Secretary of State John Kerry said later that there was a framework for a cease-fire, but that more needed to be done to make it happen. ""They [the Israelis] understand the terrible box that they find themselves in because they want to end the rockets. And unfortunately, since the last ceasefire, the Hamas leadership has felt cornered. And the only way out of that corner, in their opinion, was to get better, more accurate, longer range rockets. ""And they've been digging tunnels, apparently constantly, that can come up inside Israeli territory. And the Israelis have a perfectly legitimate objective to try to destroy as much as of the rocketry as they can and to destroy the tunnels.""

"Daytona Beach, Florida (CNN) -- It was never Milka Duno's intention to become a race car driver, although her parents may have had an inkling when, as a 12-year-old, she took her mother's Chevrolet on a joyride. The Venezuelan-born former model came to racing late, aged 24, and since then, has become one of motorsport's most prolific and versatile female drivers, racing all over the world at speeds often exceeding 200 miles per hour. In a sport dominated by men, she has more than one hundred races and eight major wins to her credit, including an overall win at road racing's Miami Grand Prix in 2004 and a second-place finish in the 24 Hours of Daytona endurance race in 2007. Road racing is a term used to describe types of motorsport which take place on purpose-built tarmac tracks. Now, Duno is determined to become the first Latin woman to compete in NASCAR, the major U.S. stock car racing series. Sponsors willing, she says she will compete in the NASCAR Nationwide series this year. A stock car is a car that's customized for racing. There are few major league professional sports where men and women compete directly, and stock car racing is expensive, competitive and potentially lethal. Duno has already cracked a rib and a tooth this season, after a broadside hit from another car at full speed in an ARCA stock-car series race at Salem Speedway in Indiana. But, she tells CNN, ""I like the difficult challenge. Everything hard to get -- I like that."" Duno has driven a variety of cars during her career and has constantly had to master new skills -- but her love of learning is abundant. A former naval engineer, she has Master's degrees in Organizational Development, Naval Architecture, Aquaculture and Maritime Business, and is currently also learning to pilot speedboats and helicopters. Here she shares with CNN the life lessons race car driving has taught her. Forget the competition and focus on your goal ... There are 42 other cars that want to win the race, too, and they have more experience than me, but it doesn't matter. Do everything with determination and passion. When you feel clear about what you want, you have a high probability of being successful. Have confidence in your team; have confidence in yourself ... Whether you are a race car driver or working as an engineer or in an office, you have to see what you want, and believe that you can do it. You have to have confidence in your team, and if you are working alone, you have to have confidence in yourself. If you have this mentality, you can get what you want in any area. Baidu boss: China helps women succeed at work . Work as hard as it takes ... I did four Master's degrees -- three simultaneously. I was in two universities at the same time. I started two (degrees during the day) and then one at night. It was crazy with all the books on the table. I'd cry sometimes and say, 'How can I finish that?' And I would just calm down and start doing things little by little. It was my focus: All my energy went into my education at that time. Success relies on multiple factors ... It's not only gas and brake like people think. You have to know so much about the car, check the computer for the latest information, give the right information to the engineer so he can make the right adjustment. In the end, you need so many things working right to win the race. Saudi female entrepreneurs exploit changing attitudes . Gender doesn't matter -- success does ... It doesn't matter if you are a woman or a man. The important thing is your ability, your intelligence and your determination -- how strong you are. In racing, you have to drive the same fast car, you have to be good like the others. When you put the helmet on, it doesn't matter if you are woman or man: your mission is to compete to win. Talk to your seniors as much as you can ... All the time, I'm talking (to the crew chief), because it's the only way to learn -- from people that have more experience than you. Small improvements can equal big victories ... I always want a faster car. Always, we are looking for more and more and more. All the practice ... is just to find some tenth of a second.","Milka Duno has more than one hundred races and eight wins to her credit .

"New York (CNN) -- Two life coaches who hosted a radio show called ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" apparently committed suicide together in their Brooklyn apartment, police said. Motivational speaker John Littig, 48, and his common-law psychotherapist wife, Lynne Rosen, 46, were found with plastic bags over their heads and a tube attached to a canister of helium, according to police. Two suicide notes were found, police said. The manager of the building, Hasan Boztepe, 51, said he smelled a strong odor coming from the apartment and broke down the door Monday morning after no one answered his repeated knocks. He found the bodies sitting on a couch, holding hands. The canister with an open valve was on Rosen's right, he said. Boztepe said he also found two suicide notes, one apparently written by a man and one by a woman. In the man's note, Boztepe remembered the words: ""I can't take it anymore, my wife is in too much pain."" ""I was shocked. I am still in shock. I feel so bad for these people,"" Boztepe said. Screening for suicide: A psychiatrist's take . He said he knew the couple and stopped by the apartment last week to fix something for Littig. ""He walked me to the door and said 'thank you very much.' He was a very nice guy -- and a couple of days later, this."" The couple's radio show, ""The Pursuit of Happiness,"" on WBAI-99.5 FM focused on ""personal development, growth and creativity"" according to their website. It was an hourlong show airing every other Thursday afternoon. ""RIP Lynne Rosen + John Littig. Partners on air and in life,"" the station posted Thursday on Facebook and Twitter. The couple also led a life coaching consulting company, Why Not Now, offering coaching ""designed to help foster and encourage your inner strengths,"" and ""put you confidently on the path to designing the life you've always wanted to live,"" according to their website. ""You should try to do something that scares you every day,"" Littig said on a show in February. ""People really need to try to implement that into their lives,"" Rosen later added.

"(CNN) -- Sheryl Sandberg wants young girls to ""ban bossy,"" but for those of us soon-to-graduate, just-graduated and will-I-ever-graduate ladies just entering the working world, there's another word that's even more toxic. That word is ""pushy."" At least, that's what my Lean In Circle thinks. A new book by Sandberg, ""Lean In: For Graduates,"" targets women like us, but we were already paying attention. My Circle is all 20-somethings with dreams of media industry success. We wanted our group to exist as a third-wave feminist answer to boys clubs, with their oak-paneled rooms and clouds of cigar smoke. We share job announcements, work dilemmas and interviewing tips and tricks. A guy recently asked me, ""Lean In Circle -- is that, like, a book club?"" Sort of. Not quite. According to Sandberg's Lean In Foundation, 14,000 Lean In Circles meet regularly around the globe, and we don't just reread ""Lean In"" over mimosas. Lean In Circles were conceived as ""small peer groups that allow you to learn and share in an atmosphere of confidentiality and trust."" The Washington Post described the ethos as ""Alcoholics Anonymous fused with Girl Scouts,"" and I have yet to find a more accurate depiction of my particular Circle environment. And so we formed, and rallied around our Circle mission: to sit at the table and push back against ""pushy"" to find our first jobs. 'Wait your turn' My mom was one of many who cautioned their daughters with the same advice: Wait your turn, don't be pushy. But when I was 22, still in college, interning at a magazine in New York City and illegally subletting a run-down room, that advice just wasn't cutting it anymore. I was one semester away from graduation and the real world, and I was dreading it. One of my internship supervisors jokingly introduced me to a colleague: ""This is Julia Carpenter, and she is terrified that she will graduate without a job."" It was true. Many of my peers moved back home with their parents to wait out this horrific economy, and unequivocally, they were miserable. Many of my friends in journalism moved to cities like New York or San Francisco and waited months for a job. Some worked multiple part-time jobs to make ends meet, and every day without a lead meant more hope slipping away. When I was reading ""Lean In"" within the mouse-ridden confines of my apartment, Sandberg's words stoked the long-squelched dreams that had always hovered in the top pages of my journals. As an English major and a journalism student, many of the feminist tenets in ""Lean In"" weren't new to me, but they also weren't applicable to me yet. She urges women to find supportive significant others who will see a relationship as a partnership, not a trade-off. Many of her stories about the intersection of family planning, motherhood and careerdom didn't have much of an effect. Those were things I'd been reading about in women's studies textbooks for years, examples of how progressive society had helped women out of the home and into the workplace and back. What was new to me was her practical application of these sometimes abstract concepts. For every lesson, Sandberg had a story to share about boardroom drama at Facebook, Google and elsewhere. In my young life, I hadn't had any Peggy Olson moments in which men looked up my skirt in the office or openly critiqued me for being a woman in a college classroom. Instead, Sandberg's vivid depictions of workplace inequality -- of women who were constantly overlooked for the promotion, of female executives too shy to raise their hands in team discussion -- resonated as examples of the gender bias traps still harming women's success. I had been passed on for projects because of reasons like ""Why would a girl be interested in politics?"" and the word ""bitch"" had been thrown at me to end a conversation. Sandberg's examples provided simple solutions: Speak with purpose. Sit at the table. Sandberg writes that many women struggle to be bold in workplace. In my case, it was in the world of job hunting. We fear that putting ourselves out there means we will be perceived as ""pushy."" No one wants to be called that dreaded word just as she's trying to get a job. I realized that not pushing hard enough for the job that I wanted was even scarier than not having a job. I feared that I would be waiting in the wings, clutching my pages-long rÃ©sumÃ© and feeling insecure, as droves of confident, talented men dared to sit at the table. I knew to get that dream job, I was going to have to push forward and sit right beside those guys, just as Sandberg wrote. 'Is there a job there for me?' Closing that confidence gap isn't easy, especially after a lifetime of ""Wait your turn."" I read that when Sandberg was job hunting -- honestly, more like ""job picking"" -- then-Google CEO Eric Schmidt gave her some invaluable advice, which ultimately became my guidepost. ""Only one criterion matters when picking a job -- fast growth."" In my own job hunt, in the midst of interviewing and applying, I found myself playing the same neurotic games many of my female peers have copped to: ""Did they even get my application?"" ""Oh my God, they hated my application"" and of course, ""Why did I even send in an application, I suck."" On the other hand, men send in applications even if they meet just some of the listed qualifications. ""I've been really forward (almost to the point of being pushy?) in the last year,"" a member of our Lean In Circle told me. ""But the only consequence there might've been for that is not getting a response to an application."" Not all of Sandberg's advice resonated with my Circle. Business cards and job titles don't mean much to us, and unlike many of Sandberg's contemporaries, we've come up in a startup culture that eschews formalism. ""A lot of my job search happened over beers, over shared criticisms, over social media interactions,"" said one member of my Circle. ""If I said some of the suggested scripts she uses in the book, the person I was talking to would think I was a robot. When members of my Circle discuss job prospects -- which we're doing ever-more-frequently as members prep for graduation -- the first question we ask isn't ""What's the position?"" Instead, it's ""What would you be doing?"" The day before I graduated from college, I received a job offer from the magazine where I had interned while reading ""Lean In."" The job was awesome. I would be living in a city I loved, working with amazing people and doing something I knew I was good at. But my heart was still set on another opportunity. A member of my Circle had referred me for a sweet spot on the Washington Post's digital engagement team, but after a few rounds of interviews I was still waiting for an answer. ""You just have to wait,"" people told me. My newly Sheryl-fied inner voice said otherwise. I called and explained the situation. ""Is there a job there for me?"" I remember saying. ""We were going to offer you the job tomorrow,"" my now-boss said. ""So -- what are you thinking?"" 'That's my girl' At a recent brunch with a college friend, she told me she's happy at her job, but looking for the next step, hopefully a new gig that will allow her to travel and improve her skills. ""I want to e-mail these giants in my field to introduce myself and ask about job openings,"" she said. ""But I don't want to. I don't want to impose. They're going to be like 'Who is this girl? Why is she e-mailing me?' And I know my male colleagues wouldn't think twice. They'd send that e-mail."" I immediately made a mental note to add her to our Circle. I know my Circle members would say it's an ongoing struggle for women in the workplace, and you have to lean in bit by bit. They're right. If anything else, you need to do it to improve the quality of workplaces for other women, even on the days when the confidence gap thwarts your plans to proceed boldly. So even when I couldn't find a connection with Sandberg's discussion of work-life balance and motherhood or the buttoned-up culture of top tech executives, ""Lean In"" can't just be written off as a book for mid-level career women. For me and my Circle -- all women new to our first job or still in college and looking for that first job -- Sandberg's simple suggestion to proceed boldly, empowered us to look at the job hunt and our workplace interactions. We're wary of the gender gap not just in salary, but in how it shapes discussion and assignment in our offices. Even in the early days of a new gig, we're committed to closing that confidence (and achievement) gap. That's something we can take away from the pages. That's why a Circle is more than just a book club. In the middle of a conference call at work last week, I jumped into the conversation. ""I can explain this,"" I said, and launched into a short description of a project my team and I had been rolling out. ""When you said 'I can explain this,' you actually leaned in,"" a female colleague said to me afterward. ""You physically leaned in closer to the desk. I was like, 'That's my girl.'""

"Glasgow, Scotland (CNN) -- [Breaking news alert, 6:23 a.m. GMT (01:23 a.m. ET)] . Scotland will remain part of the United Kingdom -- along with England, Wales and Northern Ireland -- following a historic referendum vote. A majority of voters rejected the possibility of Scotland breaking away and becoming an independent nation. With 31 of 32 councils declared, the ""No"" campaign has won the referendum on Scottish independence. Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond admitted defeat in Scotland's independence referendum Friday -- and urged the rest of Scotland to do the same. In a televised statement, he thanked Scotland ""for 1.6 million votes for Scottish independence.""A turnout of 86% is one of the highest in the democratic world for any such vote, he said. [Original story published at 12.37 p.m. ET] . Voters in Scotland made their choice Thursday -- remain part of the United Kingdom, or form their own independent nation. They chose to remain. With 31 of 32 of councils reporting, the ""No"" campaign had garnered enough votes to secure their victory, and with it Scotland's continued place within the union. The first councils to declare all went to the ""No"" campaign, as did the capital, Edinburgh, which voted overwhelmingly to stay in the union with 123,927 for ""Yes"" and 194,628 ""No"" votes. Argyll and Bute and Aberdeenshire also voted ""No."" Glasgow delivered a solid win for the independence camp with 194,779 votes for ""Yes,"" and 169,347 for ""No,"" but lead was not big enough to overturn the ""No"" camp's overall majority so far, which maintains a 8% (54% to 46%) lead over pro-independence camp. The majority of the early results have been going the anti-independence camp's way. The ""No"" campaign extended lead with Angus and East Dunbartonshire council results, alongside a landslide in Dumfries and Galloway. The oil-rich city of Aberdeen also strongly voted for the unionist camp. The city of Dundee was the first big gain for the independence campaign, voting ""Yes"" with 53,620 votes for, 39,880 against. The individual counts by local authorities are ultimately immaterial as it is the total number of votes countrywide that will determine the outcome. Polls at more than 5,500 stations across all districts, from the remote highlands and islands to the big cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow, closed at 10 p.m. local time (5 p.m. ET). People still in line to vote at that time were allowed to cast ballots. High turnout . The first districts to report turnout reported high participation -- well over 80% in most cases -- Mary Pitcaithly, chief counting officer, announced in Edinburgh. Turnout in Glasgow, one of the Yes campaign's heartlands, was a relatively disappointing 75%. More than 4.2 million people registered to vote on the question: ""Should Scotland be an independent country?"" A vote for independence would mean Scotland, with its population of about 5.3 million, splits from the rest of the United Kingdom, made up of England, Wales and Northern Ireland, in addition to Scotland. ""The people of Scotland have engaged in this conversation,"" Phil MacHugh, a spokesman for the ""Yes"" camp, told CNN on Thursday night. ""They have really gone out there, found out the information that they wanted to know, and made that choice today."" Prime minister's address . British Prime Minister David Cameron will make an address Friday morning. The content will depend on the outcome of the vote, but in the event that Scottish voters decide to stay in the union, Downing Street says he will refer to plans for further redistribution of powers from the central government to the Scottish Parliament, signed by Westminster leaders earlier this week. The counting officer for Edinburgh, Sue Bruce, explained just after 10 p.m. that each ballot will be double-checked, to verify each voter's decision. Addressing dozens of election workers, Bruce added, ""I look forward to working with you during the course of the evening to deliver an accurate and transparent Edinburgh count in which you and the voters of Edinburgh can have full confidence."" Voting was brisk at one polling station in Glasgow as the polls opened Thursday, with many people voting on the way to work or before taking their children to school. Bad weather or the sheer volume of votes cast could slow down the counting process. However, the weather forecast appears good so far -- important when some ballot boxes must be collected by helicopter, plane or boat from polling stations on distant islands. Allegations of voting fraud were reported by Glasgow City Council, with several instances of people turning up at voting booths in Scotland's largest city to vote, only to be told that they had already voted. The Council stressed that there was never actually a situation of double voting and the affected ballots are now being searched for and taken away. Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond, who has led the pro-independence ""Yes Scotland"" campaign, cast his ballot Thursday morning in the village of Strichen, Aberdeenshire. Labour lawmaker Alistair Darling, who has headed the pro-union ""Better Together"" campaign -- backed by the main parties in Westminster -- voted in Edinburgh, while former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, another pro-union campaigner, voted in the town of Kirkcaldy. For the first time, the vote was extended to 16- and 17-year olds living in Scotland. Nearly 110,000 people younger than 18 have registered to vote. Voters in the referendum did not have to be British citizens; Commonwealth, Irish and EU citizens who live in Scotland and are registered to vote there can cast a ballot. However, Scots living outside Scotland do not have a say. Nearly 790,000 people applied for a postal vote -- the largest volume of registration for postal votes ever in Scotland. After the polls closed, Salmond tweeted, ""This has been a remarkable day. Scotland's future truly is in Scotland's hands.""

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN) -- Young women in bright miniskirts and high heels line up to sell themselves in the dingy back streets throughout the Russian capital. Moscow's illegal flesh markets are flourishing, with up to 30 women at each pickup point, or tochka, standing in order of price for the night. Russian police acknowledge that human trafficking for sexual exploitation is a major problem. Customers light up the lines with their car headlights and are asked to pay between $100 and $700 for a woman. Aid workers for groups fighting for women's rights say Moscow is witnessing a surge in prostitution, including forced prostitution, as a result of Russia's booming economy. They say thousands of young women are made to work as sex slaves on the city's streets, unable to escape from the ruthless and violent criminal gangs who traffic them.  Watch Moscow's thriving sex trade » . ""It's because of the economic boom they are brought here,"" said Afsona Kadyrova of the Angel Coalition aid agency, which rehabilitates trafficked women and children. ""The fast pace of development in Moscow has fueled demand for a range of cheap workers, including prostitutes."" To investigate the thriving trade, CNN went undercover posing as potential customers and gained access to speak directly to the prostitutes and their pimps. ""Take your pick from any of the girls,"" the female organizer said at one location, lines of women all around. ""The expensive ones are on the right, for $600 and $700 a night. The women on the left are $100."" Aid agencies say many of the women working here are tricked into coming to Moscow on the promise of an education or a good job. They say others are simply kidnapped from their hometowns and forced to work as prostitutes in Moscow.  Watch one woman describe how her uncle duped her into prostitution » . Russian police acknowledge that human trafficking for sexual exploitation is a major problem, saying they do what they can to fight it by raiding brothels suspected of forced prostitution and arresting gang members who run them. But the problem, they say, lies elsewhere. ""First of all, we have virtually open borders, and badly controlled migration flows from nearby countries,"" said Alexander Krasnov of Russia's Interior Ministry Police. ""Secondly, we still don't have a basic law that defines victims' rights. At the moment, it's mostly aid agencies that deal with it."" Aid agencies say they are handling a growing number of deeply traumatized victims rescued from brothels and pimps in the Moscow area. One U.N. organization, the International Organization for Migration, recently opened a treatment and rehabilitation center to cope with the large numbers of sexually exploited and trafficked women who come for help. At this center, Christine, a 27-year-old Nigerian woman, tells how she acquired a painful 4-inch scar across her right cheek. She says she was lured to Russia from Nigeria four years ago by her uncle. He promised to give her a college education, she says. But instead, she says, he sent her to a Moscow brothel. He told her ""the kind of job I'm going to be doing is prostitution."" ""I ask him, 'Why prostitution? Why not another job to pay the money?' He says I didn't speak the language. I cannot do any other job."" She added, ""It made me feel very bad. I felt that I'm not going to do it over my dead body."" But when she tried to run away, her uncle cut her face, says Christine, who asked that her last name not be used. ""He made me know that if I don't cooperate with him, something bad will happen to me -- that if I made an attempt to run away, it would end in taking my life. So I was really scared about that,"" she said. Aid workers say Russia has become a prime destination for trafficked women from Africa, the Far East and former Soviet states. There are no exact figures, but aid agencies estimate that thousands of trafficked women are on Moscow's streets. ""Before, it was just a country of origin for Europe and the U.S. and elsewhere in the world,"" Kadyrova said. ""But right now, we see that Russia has become a destination country also."" According to the group's Web site, human traffickers ""prey on the dreams of impoverished women seeking employment and opportunities for the future."" Most women are young and single with little education; some are orphans and college students; others are married with children. ""All of them are lured by advertising images of a beautiful life beyond the borders of their homelands -- making them easy prey to the thousands of traffickers advertising in newspapers, on radio, television, in the metro and on the streets for wonderful work abroad with no experience necessary,"" the group says. For millions, Russia's new economic prosperity has been a blessing. But for those caught up in the sex trade, it's a curse. Christine managed to escape after meeting a woman from a church who helped her. ""I was crying all the time, telling her, 'I don't want this kind of job,' "" she said.","Aid groups say booming economy has fueled demand for prostitutes in Moscow .

"(CNN) -- It's not your typical holiday travel snag. Two planes bumped into each other on the tarmac at New York's LaGuardia International Airport around 11 a.m. Tuesday. After a hectic morning, passenger Stormie Alsruhe, 30, was just settling into her seat on Southwest Airlines Flight 449 looking forward to enjoying her coffee. ""And then there was this bump. I look out the window and I actually see the tip of the plane (wing) falling off,"" said Alsruhe, who was heading to join her husband's family in Denver for the holidays. ""I saw it kind of dangle and it just fell. And I thought, 'OK great, we're not taking off now,' "" she said. The wingtip of the Southwest 737 clipped an American Airlines 737 awaiting a gate at LaGuardia. There were no injuries, according to both airlines. The Southwest aircraft bound for Denver has been taken out of service for inspection and repairs, the airline said. ""The 143 customers on board (Southwest) Flight 449 deplaned the aircraft via air stairs and were (bused) to the terminal where our teams are working to get them to their destinations,"" Southwest said in a statement. Alsruhe said she is flying to Denver on Tuesday afternoon on another flight. The American plane, operating as Flight 1104, had originated from Dallas Fort-Worth. The plane was ""taxiing to its gate at LaGuardia Airport when its left horizontal stabilizer and the winglet of a moving Southwest Airlines 737 made contact,"" American said in a statement. A winglet is a vertical extension of an airliner wing that is designed to save fuel. Passengers tweeted photos of the damage Tuesday. ""Plane I was on had its wing clipped,"" one said. The American flight's 143 passengers and six crew members exited the plane normally through the jet bridge, the airline said, and the plane is being inspected. Passengers on the next scheduled flight will be moved to a different plane. The Federal Aviation Administration said it will investigate the incident. The FAA said the Southwest aircraft was on Taxiway A preparing for departure while the American flight was taxiing to the gate. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said the incident didn't impact operations.","Boeing 737s bump into each other on tarmac at LaGuardia International Airport .

"(CNN) -- Alaska officials have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to block -- at least temporarily -- same-sex marriage from moving ahead in the state. A resolution could come as early as Friday. A federal judge there last week had ordered gay and lesbian couples be allowed to apply for marriage licenses and to wed after a normal three-day waiting period. But everything is now on hold until the justices issue an order. If the state loses at the high court, same-sex marriage could begin at 11 a.m. local time Friday. Alaska's Department of Law said ""the state cannot issue any marriage licenses until the stay is lifted."" Some couples had begun applying for marriage licenses as early as Monday and in at least some cases, couples were married when they were granted an expedited consideration. The state then asked for a stay, saying it needs more time to file more detailed appeals to show its sovereign power to define marriage is being usurped by the courts. Officials, including the governor said waiting until the broader legal questions are resolved is best for all Alaskans. ""Without a stay, the interim licensing of marriages contrary to Alaska law could easily lead to administrative chaos that will harm everyone's interest in the orderly enforcement of domestic relations laws,"" said the state's high court appeal. But a number of same-sex couples cited a federal appeals court ruling last week that struck down bans in Nevada and Idaho as unconstitutional. That appeals court's legal jurisdiction includes Alaska and other Western states. The high court case is Parnell v. Hamby (14A413).","Alaska asked U.S. Supreme Court to block same-sex marriage for now .

""And it gives me hope that this global summit may actually produce the leadership that is necessary to try to come together and move the needle, to take advantage of the small window of time -- and I mean that -- the small window of time that we have left in order to be able to prevent the worst impacts of climate change from already happening."" He urged participants to use their influence to steer world leaders toward committing to greater action on climate change in time for discussions on an international climate change agreement to be held in Lima, Peru, in December and in Paris in 2015.

"(CNN) -- The term ""software engineer"" conjures images of pasty-faced young men with poor posture and limited social skills. And people think fashion models are all beauty and no brains. At least, those are the stereotypes. So what will the world make of Lyndsey Scott, a model for Prada and Victoria's Secret, who spends her spare time building mobile apps? The 29-year-old has appeared in major magazines like Harper's Bazaar, W and British Vogue, but seems more proud of getting her iPhone and iPad apps approved by Apple. ""With modeling, you never have control over anything,"" Scott told CNN. ""So being able to have complete power with these apps I develop is very fulfilling."" Scott has built several apps for iOS platforms. Two are currently sold in the Apple store, and she's preparing to release a social networking app in coming weeks. Before the self-taught programmer began modeling for high-end designers like Louis Vuitton, Prada, Gucci, Fendi and Vera Wang, she was an undiscovered New Jersey teen who loved playing calculator games. In high school, she taught herself the software documentation and quickly learned how to program on her TI-89 calculator. ""I didn't realize I was even coding at that point,"" Scott said. ""I first got into it just to make fun games and entertain myself."" Her game-coding skills didn't score her many points with her classmates, however. The 5-foot-9-inch model said she was a late bloomer and that growing up ""is still hard to talk about"" because of the bullying and taunting she endured. ""It got so bad in high school I couldn't even look people in the face,"" Scott said. ""I would hide out in school so I wouldn't have to eat lunch in the cafeteria or see people in between classes."" At Amherst College, Scott learned coding languages Java, C++ and MIPS while majoring in theater and computer science. But instead of pursuing a programming career, she plunged into modeling. She got her big modeling break in 2009 when she became the first African-American to land an exclusive contract with Calvin Klein for New York Fashion Week. ""It happened at a time when there was no interest in me as a model,"" she said. ""I always dreamed of it, but I wasn't expecting it at all. I was beyond surprised."" That same year Scott was chosen for one of the year's most coveted fashion shows: Victoria's Secret. She said she was ""shocked and honored"" to join a lineup of supermodels including Heidi Klum, Miranda Kerr and Alessandra Ambrosio. Meanwhile, she continued challenging expectations by teaching herself how to program Python and Objective-C. ""I think a lot of models thought I was strange having a computer on my lap in the middle of a casting line,"" Scott said. ""I never really talked about programming in the modeling business. I kept the worlds very divided."" Scott's first iOS app was a charity-based project aimed at helping young scholars in Uganda. The app, Educate!, finds sponsors for Ugandan students and guides them toward becoming leaders and entrepreneurs. ""I learned about Educate! in college. It was an organization founded by two Amherst students. When I found out that Uganda has the youngest population in the world and the highest youth poverty rate, I wanted to get involved,"" she said. ""It was rejected (by Apple) a few times. I had a big battle with Apple, going back and forth, so it was a huge relief when it finally passed."" She has since developed several more applications, including iPort, which helps models and other creative types organize their professional portfolios on an iPad. ""I noticed so many models were using iPads to show casting directors their work, but it looked messy and didn't have a nice interface,"" Scott said. ""So I made iPort as similar functionally as an actual portfolio but much more convenient."" Her brother, Matthew, is one of her biggest fans. ""Lyndsey is a mix of Bill Gates and Giselle (Bundchen),"" said Matthew Scott. ""She combines her passion for modeling and passion of coding to help improve our world."" Last month, Scott visited a middle school in New York City's Harlem neighborhood to speak with students interested in computer programming. ""We have this idea of people in technology being and looking a certain way,"" she said. ""That stereotype is destructive, and I think that's part of the reason why female and minority programmers are so few."" Scott said computer coding has now become a second professional life for her. She has plans for many more apps, and wants to learn coding for Android as well. The young dual-career woman would never have called herself a nerd while growing up because she saw it as a hurtful word at the time. ""But now that I'm older, if it means being smart and having interests like computer science, then I have no problem being a nerd,"" she said.","Lyndsey Scott models for Prada, Victoria's Secret, Calvin Klein .

"Rome (CNN) -- The pope's former butler, Paolo Gabriele, was convicted Saturday of aggravated theft for leaking confidential papal documents and sentenced to 18 months in prison. He was also ordered to pay the costs of the trial at the Vatican City courthouse. The case is the biggest to go before the Vatican court in decades. It has been the subject of intense interest because a book based on the leaked papers revealed claims of corruption within the Roman Catholic Church hierarchy. Presiding judge Giuseppe Dalla Torre said he was reducing the three-year term requested by the prosecution to 18 months because of mitigating circumstances. These included the fact that Gabriele had no previous criminal record and his acknowledgment of ""having betrayed"" the pope's trust, Dalla Torre said, in a reading of the verdict broadcast on Vatican TV. Gabriele, who could have faced up to eight years in prison, looked relieved as the 18-month sentence was handed down. Pope's ex-butler had trove of documents 'of interest' It is not yet clear whether the former butler will serve the full sentence in an Italian prison or whether it may be suspended. He could also be pardoned by the pope, of whom he has asked forgiveness for his actions. Jesuit Father Federico Lombardi, head of the Holy See media office, told journalists at a briefing that Gabriele would remain under house arrest for the time being. His lawyer has three days time to present an appeal Lombardi said. If an appeal is presented and an appeal trial takes place, Gabriele would remain under house arrest during this time, he said. ""There is a concrete possibility that the pope might pardon him (Gabriele), but it is up to him to decide when and how,"" Lombardi added. Prison terms handed down by the court are served in the Italian prison system under an agreement between Vatican City and Italy, since there are no long-term detention facilities within the tiny city-state. Gabriele had defended his actions as having a moral objective in his final remarks before the jury of three lay judges retired to consider its verdict. ""I feel strongly the conviction inside of me that I did it because of my overwhelming love, I would say visceral, for the Church of Christ and for its visible leader,"" he told the court. "" I repeat, I don't feel like a thief."" His father was also in court Saturday to hear the final arguments. Defense lawyer Cristiana Arru said she was pleased with the verdict, according to a briefing by the small pool of journalists allowed to attend the trial. In her closing statement, Arru, who called for the jury to reduce the theft charge to a lesser one, had told the court that while her client's actions were illegal, they were the result of ""the evil he saw"" within the Church. Pope's former butler claims innocence in 'Vatileaks' trial . Arru told the court that Gabriele's actions were morally motivated and that she hoped that ""one day they will be recognized and applauded."" The court heard this week how police found more than 1,000 important documents among a stash of hundreds of thousands of papers in Gabriele's apartments in Vatican City and Castel Gondolfo, a town near Rome. Among them were original papers signed by Pope Benedict XVI, some of them stamped with an order for destruction, according to the journalists allowed to attend the trial. Also found in his possession were a gold nugget belonging to the pope, a signed check made out to Pope Benedict XVI for 100,000 euros and an original version of Virgil's Aeneid from 1581. In his testimony Tuesday, the former butler declared himself not guilty of a charge of aggravated theft in connection with the leaked documents -- but said he had abused the pope's trust. He told how he had photocopied many confidential papal papers, saying he did so because he wanted to expose wrongdoing and corruption. Observers say that despite the trial, questions remain about how Gabriele managed to remove such confidential and potentially damaging documents from Vatican City. There is also continued speculation over whether someone high up in the Church, perhaps a cardinal, may have helped him, although Gabriele denied having an accomplice. Some of the private documents contained allegations of financial corruption, claims the Vatican might have preferred to keep under wraps. Gabriele was arrested in May, following a Vatican investigation into how the pope's private documents appeared in the best-selling book ""Sua Santita"" (""His Holiness""), by Italian journalist Gianluigi Nuzzi. Corruption claims resulting from the book's publication, based on the leaked materials, rocked the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church and could even affect who becomes the next pope.

"New York (CNN) -- After digging their heels into a legal battle, two high-end French shoe designers can now lay claim to iconic red-soled shoes. A federal appeals court has ruled that shoe designer Christian Louboutin can enforce a U.S. trademark of the red-lacquered sole that adorns the designer's footwear when it contrasts with the color of the rest of the shoe. The court also said Wednesday that the trademark does not apply when the shoe is monochromatic, such as Yves St. Laurent's designs that were entirely red. A lawsuit filed in June 2011 by Louboutin took issue with four specific shoes from YSL's Cruise 2011 Collection: the Tribute, Tribtoo, Palais and Woodstock models, saying they violated Louboutin's trademarked ""lacquered red sole."" Louboutin appealed after a federal court judge denied an injunction in August of last year that would have kept YSL from selling shoes with red soles. In his decision last year, Judge Victor Marrero said that ""Louboutin's claim to the 'the color red' is, without some limitation, overly broad and inconsistent with the scene of trademark registration."" In the appellate decision, Circuit Judge Jose Cabranes upheld trademark protection of Louboutin's red-lacquered outsole but said that YSL's use of the red sole in its monochromatic shoe does not infringe on the trademark. According to the decision, Christian Louboutin introduced his signature red sole in 1992 and registered the red-lacquered outsole as a trademark in 2008. In a news release, YSL says that its shoe collections have included styles with red (and other colored) outsoles since the 1970s. Both sides appeared to be satisfied with the appellate court decision. Harley Lewin, the attorney for Louboutin, said his client is ""very, very pleased"" with the decision, adding that nontraditional trademarks such as colors have to be developed over time. ""Color doesn't start as something unique, it becomes unique,"" he said. ""More and more I think you'll see this coming because of the need to differentiate your product from others on the shelf,"" he said. ""It will have influence on a far broader sense than just the fashion industry."" David Bernstein, legal counsel to YSL, said in a Wednesday statement, ""We are happy to have achieved a victory in defending against Louboutin's lawsuit."" Bernstein reemphasized that YSL had not infringed on Louboutin's trademark and ""will continue to produce monochromatic shoes with red outsoles."" Louboutin's science behind the perfect high heel .

"(CNN) -- Joe Cocker, the British blues-rock singer whose raspy voice brought plaintive soul to such hits as ""You Are So Beautiful"" and the duet ""Up Where We Belong,"" died Monday after a battle with lung cancer. He was 70. Cocker's performing career spanned some 50 years, from Woodstock, where he sang the Beatles' ""With a Little Help From My Friends,"" to the digital-music era. He had tour dates scheduled well into 2015. ""Goodbye and God bless to Joe Cocker from one of his friends peace and love,"" tweeted Beatles drummer Ringo Starr. Cocker began as a singer in England at the same time as the Beatles, with whom he was often linked. He played pubs across the country in a series of rock bands before he and his Grease Band recorded ""With a Little Help From My Friends"" in 1968 with Jimmy Page, Steve Winwood and others. The song became a No. 1 hit in England and propelled him to Woodstock, where his passionate live version was a festival highlight and launched his U.S. career. Cocker scored another major success in the early 1970s with ""Mad Dogs and Englishmen,"" a live album and concert film. ""Up Where We Belong,"" his duet with Jennifer Warnes from the movie ""An Officer and a Gentleman,"" was Cocker's biggest U.S. hit, topping the Billboard singles charts in 1982. It also won him a Grammy, and the Oscar for best original song. Cocker was known for his spasmodic movements on stage, where he often flailed his arms as he sang. His distinctive moves, he said, were almost accidental. ""I never played organ or piano or guitar, so it was more out of frustration and me just trying to impersonate in a way,"" Cocker told the Broward-Palm Beach New Times in 2012. ""I did it subconsciously. People mistook for me being ill, like I had palsy. I'm not nearly so demonstrative now, but I still have my own way of feeling the rhythm."" Cocker also had lesser hits with covers of torch classic ""Cry Me a River,"" Traffic's ""Feeling Alright,"" the Boxtops' ""The Letter"" and the Beatles' ""She Came in Through the Bathroom Window."" In the 1980s his witty cover of Randy Newman's ""You Can Leave Your Hat On,"" was featured in the erotic drama ""9 1/2 Weeks"" and became a strip-tease anthem. The singer told the Daily Mail in 2013 that by the 1970s his descent into drugs and alcohol had become so severe that he sometimes forgot the lyrics to songs. ""If I'd been stronger mentally, I could have turned away from temptation,"" Cocker said. ""But there was no rehab back in those days. Drugs were readily available, and I dived in head first. And once you get into that downward spiral, it's hard to pull out of it. It took me years to get straight."" He credited his wife, Pam, with helping him get sober. ""It was Pam who helped me get myself back together,"" he said. ""She made me think positively. I was very down on myself. She made me realize people still wanted to hear me sing, and convinced me I could escape the downward spiral."" In 2012 he released the album, ""Hard Knocks."" That year he talked to NPR about the project and his love of his life in Colorado -- despite the harsh winters. ""I embrace the winter these days,"" he said in the interview. ""The best thing to do is get a big house. If you are going to have cabin fever, have a big cabin. I walk on a regular basis, I have a couple of dogs. The house tucks right into the mountains. I literally feel I have become a mountain man over these past couple of years."" Musicians of all ages and genres took to Twitter to pay tribute. ""So sad to hear about Joe Cocker.

"(CNN) -- Ooh, looks like things are heating up between Snoop Dogg and Iggy Azalea -- and not in a good way. For yet another day, the two rappers went at it on social media, with Snoop baiting her, Iggy responding and Snoop egging her on. The back-and-forth started Sunday night when Snoop posted a meme and titled it ""Iggy Azalea No Make Up."" The Instagram insult generated 11,000 comments and 50,000 likes. So Iggy posted some not-so-fancy tweets in response. They've since been deleted. But hey, this is the Internet -- and nothing is truly gone. ""Everytime I've ever spoken to you you've always been nice as hell, I'm disappointed you'd be such an ass for no reason,"" one said. ""Why would you post such a mean pic on insta when you send your body guards to ask me for pictures every time we are at shows."" That was Monday. Cue Tuesday, when Snoop was back with more -- some decidedly mean ones. He called her the b-word in one, asking her to ""cool out"" because he was only kidding. In another Instagram post, he cranked it up a notch, threatening her. And, just to rub it in, he posted a side-by-side of Iggy and Marlon Wayans' in-drag character from ""White Chicks."" Iggy fired back. ""If I'm a (b-word) for asking why you are supportive to my face but another way on your Instagram then so be it,"" one tweet said. ""Post away about this '(b-word)' I've seen all the memes the world has to offer in regards to me i honestly don't care,"" another said. Snoop responded with more expletives. Iggy followed with some retweets from supportive fans. She then posted: ""Ima be the bigger man in this situation and leave it be.""

"(CNN) -- What has the popular Pope Francis done now? A woman in Argentina says the pope called her Monday and told her she could receive Communion, despite being married to a divorced man, reports say. According to the woman and her husband, the pope allegedly said, ""There are some priests who are more papist than the pope"" -- referring to the parish priest who refused to give Communion to the woman. The Vatican initially refused to comment, but CNN received confirmation of the phone call from a Vatican press office spokesman on Wednesday. On Thursday, the Vatican released a statement responding to the media attention saying the content of the pope's personal phone calls ""cannot be confirmed as reliable, and is a source of misunderstanding and confusion."" The defensiveness of the pope's PR handlers hints of a cleanup. It's true that Pope Francis has earned the nickname the ""cold-calling pope"" for his practice of picking up the phone and calling everyday folks (although there has been at least one hoax about a papal phone call). The story did, however, start with a Facebook post and went from Argentina to Italy to England before being picked up by U.S. news agencies. That's plenty of opportunity for misinterpretation. If the pope were to counsel a Catholic in this way, it would be significant. The Catholic Church officially teaches that marriage is for life and that couples who divorce are still married in the eyes of the church unless they receive an annulment -- a process that literally nullifies the first marriage. (Reports do not indicate whether the man's first marriage was annulled, but it's unlikely since the couple say they were married civilly.) The church's position is based on Jesus' teachings in the Bible equating marriage after divorce with adultery. Conservative Catholics, many of whom have been less than thrilled with the new pope during the first year of his papacy, are not happy with the latest news. One Catholic blogger insists the story must not be true. Of course, as the representative of the magisterium (or teaching authority) of the church, the pope is expected to toe the party line on church teaching -- especially in public. And he should have the media savvy to know that private conversations often go viral. On the other hand, more liberal Catholics are hopeful, given speculation that pastoral practices toward divorced and remarried Catholics may change after a worldwide meeting of bishops in October. German bishops, especially Cardinal Walter Kasper, have long lobbied for relaxing the rules that bar Catholics in so-called ""irregular"" marriages from the sacraments. In the United States, the rule -- much like the one against artificial birth control -- is routinely ignored by most Catholics. Despite all the brouhaha, this phone conversation was actually a private one, between ""Father Bergoglio""-- as the pope allegedly identified himself -- and the woman. He also wouldn't be the first Catholic priest to privately tell a divorced person to go ahead and receive Communion. Even if he is the pope, such a private conversation does not automatically change centuries of church teaching, as the most recent Vatican statement points out. Yet it's true that the pope has also publicly called for more pastoral sensitivity and inclusiveness not only toward the divorced and remarried, but also toward gay and lesbian Catholics, single parents and others. There's a reason his new book is called ""The Church of Mercy."" It's too early to tell if this is the pope's way of asserting his position on a possible change in pastoral practice or even church teaching. Still, it could be a lot more significant than his more symbolic gestures, such as eschewing red shoes and letting kids ride in the popemobile. Since it's the Easter season, I'll remain hopeful.","Reports that Pope Francis told woman married to divorced man that taking Communion OK .

"(CNN) -- It's December 23, so ""let's rumble!"" As last-minute shoppers fueled on eggnog scramble for those final gifts for relatives thrice-removed, there's another celebration afoot Tuesday: Festivus. Festivus was introduced in the ninth and final season of ""Seinfeld"" as a holiday that George Costanza, played by Jason Alexander, begrudgingly grew up with as an antidote to the season's growing focus on consumerism. While the episode originally aired on December 18, 1997, the holiday and its eccentric customs -- like the ""feats of strength"" and ""airing of grievances"" -- live on with much fanfare. ""Many Christmases ago, I went to buy a doll for my son. I reach for the last one they had -- but so did another man. As I rained blows upon him, I realized there had to be another way!"" George's father, Frank Costanza, played by Jerry Stiller, explained in the episode. And so a ""Festivus for the rest of us"" was born. The Twitterverse is rife with Festivus references this time of year. ""HAPPY FESTIVUS!"" Alexander exclaimed Tuesday on the site. ""May ur pole be straight, ur feats be strong & your grievances be few. With love from the Costanzas - Frank, Estelle, George."" Festivus has even spawned literature like a 2005 guide to the holiday called ""Festivus: The Holiday for the Rest of Us."" Despite the absurdity of it all, Seinfeld writer Dan O'Keefe said he, in fact, grew up with this peculiar holiday of his own father's creation, and the ""airing of grievances"" into a tape recorder was a real part of it. However, the pole and the father-son wrestling match were made for TV. ""I was not forced to wrestle my father. If I had, I would've been raised by the state of New York,"" O'Keefe told CNN in a 2013 interview about the ""feats of strength"" that appear in the episode. Much like Costanza, O'Keefe didn't want the tradition to leave the family circle. ""I didn't want to put it on TV because it was sort of a family disgrace,"" O'Keefe joked. But when the show's other writers and Jerry Seinfeld caught wind of it from O'Keefe's brother, majority opinion prevailed. Fellow writer Jeff Schaffer came up with the Festivus aluminum pole, which fans can now purchase online. The real symbol was a clock in a bag nailed to the wall, which O'Keefe says his father still hasn't explained to him. ""I thought it was going to be the most forgettable part of it that was cut out for syndication,"" O'Keefe said. Instead, the pole and the holiday took on a life of their own. And that is a Festivus miracle. ""Seinfeld"" at 25: Five reasons nothing is everything .","Festivus was popularized by ""Seinfeld"" in the show's ninth season .

"(CNN) -- Like a put-upon hotelier trying to fix a decrepit property while simultaneously dealing with demanding guests, the decline of print and rise in peer-reviewed websites like TripAdvisor have given travel guide publishers a big headache. ""It's easier for smaller publishers (to cope with changing times),"" says Stephen Mesquita, travel publishing analyst. ""They're much fleeter of foot; it's not like they're an ocean liner that has to be turned around."" According to Mesquita's Nielsen BookScan Travel Publishing Yearbook, sales of printed world travel guides have declined by over 40% in the last seven years. But building a successful brand in the travel guide business can still be achieved, although it can mean more than just providing a hit-list of must-sees. From a company that was based on ""dirty weekends"" in England, Mr & Mrs Smith hotel guides have been doing their best to make a clean break from what went before. Set up by British couple James Lohan and Tamara Heber-Percy ten years ago, the luxury guidebook has carved a niche in a crowded marketplace by appealing to a particular demographic. ""It all started after a crappy weekend in a hotel in the Lake District (in England) when I was trying to impress Tamara,"" says Lohan. ""We realized there weren't really any guide books that were talking to a 30-something audience."" As hotels upped their game to appeal to a more stylish clientele who could afford weekends away from the weekly grind, Lohan and Heber-Percy saw an opportunity. Remortgaging their house to produce and publish the first guide to these hip new hotels was the first challenge, but finding a receptive publisher and distributor was almost harder. ""The first book was nearly impossible, publishers didn't understand our idea and said another luxury guidebook wasn't needed,"" says Lohan. ""We thought naively that we could ring up Waterstones (bookshop) and turn up with the car boot open with boxes of books, saying, 'How many do you want?' ""But as soon as we got it out there, it was phenomenal. We've never really had to try too hard to get hotels on board since."" What they have had to do however is adapt to a rapidly changing travel environment, from the way people plan and book their holidays to what they want from a guide book. ""Many guides have reinvented their business models, becoming online booking services or increasingly doing business-to-business operations and looking to online advertising,"" says Mesquita. ""The brand these days is all important."" Now with a 24-hour travel booking service, Mr & Mrs Smith has morphed into something neither Lohan or Heber-Percy -- who have visited over 1,000 hotels over the last ten years -- could have envisioned when they began. ""We're now starting to learn a new part of the travel business. The thing it get most nervous about is note expanding into other areas, but that the integrity of the business is intact."" Personality and standing out from the crowd also helped the diminutive Luxe City Guides punch above their weight and gain a foothold in the international travel guide business. Founder Grant Thatcher champions his guides' snippy and snarky style and credits it with the guide's success. ""We're aiming at a very targeted, solvent but time poor readership, scorning the word comprehensive and going right for opinionated jugular,"" he says. Rather than the internet dilute the appeal of the guide or its money-making potential, Thatcher believes it has helped niche publications like his own. ""Inevitably, the online and digital markets have and are revolutionizing all aspects of how we travel, research and respond to travel trends. The travel guide market has become much more specialized, rather than trying to appeal to the widest audience,"" he says. Thatcher says that nearly 1.5 million Luxe City Guides have been sold since launch, while Lohan and Heber-Percy have no intention of doing away with their print editions, looking to China and Asia as the next places for their global expansion. Mesquita has also seen something of a rebound in the printed travel guide market, primarily he says as some players have simply stepped out of the game leaving a larger share for those who have weather the storm. ""Don't write print off just yet. Last year many players have disappeared from the market altogether and for some of those that have stayed they've even seen some gains in sales,"" he says.","Emergence of peer-review travel websites have had a negative knock-on effect on travel guides .
Sales of global travel guides have declined by over 40% in the last seven years .
Still a strong market for niche travel guides like Mr & Mrs Smith ."
"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Some 65 years after their service, the 300 surviving Women Airforce Service Pilots are being honored with the Congressional Gold Medal. The House of Representatives on Tuesday passed a measure awarding the women one of the national's highest civilian honors. The Senate passed a similar measure in May and President Obama is expected to sign it. Jane Tedeschi when she was in the Women Airforce Service Pilot program. With only about a quarter of the former WASPs still alive and all in their late 80s or older, it was important for the House to act quickly, Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Florida, a sponsor of the bill, told CNN. ""This is a largely overlooked veterans group. They haven't gotten the medals they deserve, the recognition they deserve,"" Ros-Lehtinen told CNN. From the time she was about 8 years old, Jane Tedeschi wanted to fly. ""[Charles] Lindbergh was flying across the Atlantic, and a lot of other people were flying air races and things like that. It was very romantic,"" she said. Flight was still relatively new in the 1920s and 1930s, and female pilots were few. But Tedeschi was determined. In 1941, she found a childhood friend who taught flying and started taking lessons. After the friend was sent off to war and the airport near her home in Bethesda, Maryland, was closed to private flying, she traveled about 40 miles to Frederick and spent nights on the floor of a farmhouse to continue her lessons. Around the same time, Deanie Parrish was working in a bank in Avon Park, Florida, and kept seeing aviation students who were attending a flying school there. ""I asked an instructor 'Why can't I learn to fly,' and he didn't have an answer...so I decided to find out for myself."" She found an instructor and started taking lessons. These two women were not only fulfilling a personal dream. Along with 1,100 other women, they would become an instrumental part of the war effort during World War II, becoming the first women to fly U.S. military aircraft. The Women Airforce Service Pilots was born in 1942 to create a corps of female pilots able to fill all types of flying jobs at home to free male military pilots to travel to the front. In the days after the outbreak of the war, Jacqueline Cochran, one of the country's leading female pilots at the time, went to a key general to argue that women would be just as capable pilots as men if they were given the same training. She won the argument, and the program was launched. Parrish joined up at age 21 in November 1943. ""Everybody was doing something,"" she said. ""I wanted to do something for my country."" Some 25,000 women pilots applied, and 1,830 were accepted. They had to pay their own way to Texas for 21 to 27 weeks of rigorous training, for which they received less pay than the male cadets in the same program, Parrish said. Candidates had to be at least 21 years old and at least 5-feet, one-half inch tall. When Tedeschi underwent a physical, she was told her height was only 5 feet.  Watch Tedeschi recall WWII » . ""I frowned,"" she recalled. ""I said I need that half-inch, so he wrote it down."" She was in. Eventually 1,102 women completed the program and were assigned to one of 120 bases across the country to start their missions. Depending on the base, they did everything from participating in ground-to-air anti-aircraft practice; towing targets for air-to-air gunnery practice with live ammunition; flying drones; conducting night exercises; testing repaired aircraft before they were used in cadet training; serving as instructors; and transporting cargo and male pilots to embarkation points. ""We were still civilians. All of our training was to make [Army] Air Corps pilots,"" Tedeschi said. They flew more than 60 million miles in every type of aircraft -- from the PT-17 and AT-6 trainers, the fastest attack planes like the A-24 and A-25 or heavy bombers such as B-17s or B-29s. Paid $250 a month, the women were not officially part of the military -- receiving no benefits, no honors. Eventually Parrish was sent to Florida where she flew a B-26 bomber for air-to-air target practice, training gunners for combat. Tedeschi, who graduated in May 1944, was sent to a Selma, Alabama, base which did more engineering work. ""We did whatever they asked us,"" she recalled in a CNN interview. ""You knew enough about flying you could adapt ... sometimes it was a little tougher."" For instance, she would take planes up after repair which could involve acrobatic work -- ""which, of course, we liked to do,"" or be called to do night flying. While the work was technically non-combat, it could be dangerous. Thirty eight of the pilots were killed. Parrish recalled the military would not allow the flag to be put on a colleague's coffin. ""It still bothers me,"" she told CNN. As the war was winding down in December 1944, the program was closed -- with no recognition from the government and not much help for the women who served. ""You got home the best way you could,"" said Parrish. ""I paid my own way home."" The women then went off to restart their prewar lives -- but without getting any of the help that male veterans were getting. Several of the women, however, said they were not bitter since the only reason they had signed up was to do their part for the country, pointing out that they were just like the thousands of other women who also learned new skills and went to work in the factories to replace male workers sent off to war. ""We were proud of what we did, and the war was over. It was time to get on,"" said Tedeschi, who is married and 89 years old. But many Americans were not aware of their efforts. The WASP records were sealed for more than 30 years. In 1977 Congress voted to make them eligible for veterans' benefits. ""I didn't care for veteran status, but now I could have a flag on my coffin ... that is important to me,"" Parrish said. Parrish married a pilot after the war. She and her daughter, Nancy, for over a decade have documented the work of the WASPs. Read more about the WASPs at the Wings Across America Web site. While some of the WASPs say the medal itself is a nice gesture, more importantly they say they hope the publicity will teach younger generations about their accomplishments and remind some still skeptical men just how capable women are. ""People all over the country will hear about it. It will be a national event,"" Parrish said.","NEW: Congress votes to give women Congressional Gold Medal .

"(CNN) -- Portuguese sailors called it the Gates of Hell. Namibia's Bushmen speak of the land God made in anger. From the air, the bleak shoreline of the Skeleton Coast looks wonderful -- a deep green sea, fringed with surf, breaks over a shore receding into infinite dunes. From land, it's a different story. The Benguela Current rushes in, urgent and strong, hurtling the chilling Atlantic into the fierce heat of the Namib. Whale and seal skeletons from the former whaling industry still litter the coastline -- the source of the region's frightening name. Humans have suffered, too -- the remains of ships wrecked on the hidden rocks offshore rust and crumble beside the animal bones. Survivors didn't last long in this harsh environment. Punishing trip? Why, then, visit this brutal-sounding place? Because its forbidding nature has left Namibia's Skeleton Coast one of the most pristine shorelines in the world. It may be bleak, but it's beautiful. The territory extends from just north of the city of Swakopmund to the Angolan border in northwest Namibia, taking in 500 kilometers of shoreline and 2 million hectares of dunes and gravel plains. It forms a national park, divided by rivers. More: 9 not-in-the-guidebook Africa safari tips . The southern section runs between the Ugab and Hoanib Rivers, the north between the Hoanib and Kunene. Independent travelers can apply for permits for day trips but only to the south -- and it's the northern extremes, the Skeleton Coast Wilderness, that most people want to see. Visitors to the latter part of the park are restricted to around 800 a year to preserve the fragile environment. Exclusive and expensive . The only way to reach the north is to join a fly-in safari -- an exclusive, if expensive, experience. A typical four-day trip costs around $6,000 per person. After flying to an inland camp, my guide, Bariar, and I reach the sea following a 200-kilometer drive through dune country. We climb out of the Land Rover into a huge animal graveyard: seal skulls jumbled with turtles' rib cages and the colossal, bleached vertebrae of whales. The wind shunts me from one set of remains to the next. One ghoulish question suggests itself: ""Are there human skeletons, too?"" ""Of course!"" Bariar shouts, his voice almost lost in the wind. ""It's the shore of a thousand shipwrecks."" Wreck-spotting . One of the coast's best-known wrecks is a British liner, the Dunedin Star, beached by her master after hitting a reef (some say a U-boat) in the 1940s. A tug, the Sir Charles Elliott, went to her aid but it sank, too. An arch of whale bones marks the grave of the two crewmen who led the rescue attempt, trying in vain to secure a line from the ship to the shore. Every now and then the wreck of their tug can be seen above the waves. More: 10 things to know before visiting South Africa . At Cape Frio, thousands of seals provide light relief. Their noise is deafening, their smell overwhelming, but their antics draw you in. The surf is full of writhing bodies. At the water's edge, the occasional rock twitches, rolls over and throws itself into the sea. We follow the coastline for miles. Ours are the only tire marks, soon to be erased by the sand. Ghost crabs scuttle into the waves; terns swoop over the surf; a jackal flops, seemingly exhausted, onto the shore. Little game . When it comes to watching wildlife, the Skeleton Coast isn't about big game. Guides focus on small mammals, birds and insects and the stories of how they survive. With ocean fogs the only moisture supply, creatures conserve what they can. Black-backed jackals lick humidity from stones. Desert beetles channel droplets along their backs and into their mouths. Tok-tokkie beetles pair up, then climb on top of one another, taking it in turns to provide shade. Without compass or Sat Nav, Bariar drives us on a convoluted route back into the desert. He suggests I look out the window for ""unexpected stones"" -- indicators to turn left or right or double back a touch. They're meant to keep vehicles on course and not flatten tracts of this delicate ecosystem. Hear the dunes roar . We arrive at the legendary ""roaring"" dunes, climb to the top and slide down on our butts. I know the fearsome rumble comes from air trapped between grains of sand, but I still glance up convinced there are low-flying jets overhead. The next couple of days are spent hiking through gorges, tracking desert-adapted elephants and exploring a wilderness that never seems to end. What looks like wasteland to me is, to the Himba people, home.

The trip is laid on for tourists, but when it's over we head to the home of one of the guides on the tour. His mother offers me a necklace of porcupine quills as young girls sit and smile. Eventually they overcome their shyness and get up to sing. As I leave, I notice a small boy, eyeing me from the top of a dune. Keen to impress, he somersaults over the top and falls flat on his face in the sand. He gets up, shakes himself down and laughs. Even in this tough environment, the survivors find plenty of reasons to smile.

"(CNN) -- Adele, who won big at the 2012 Grammys, once told Karl Lagerfeld off when he said that she was talented and pretty but a little too fat. Maybe his words got to her. The British pop star made news this week when she admitted to wearing four pairs of Spanx under a dress that wowed the audiences at the Grammys. Apparently, this was an improvement over her original dress that featured a built-in corset and in which she passed out when she tried it on. Spanx is a line of undergarments that offers solutions for women of all sizes and shapes. You can target bulging stomachs, jiggling upper arms, aging breasts and any other body part that may need some enhancement. No longer an item of fantasy play or a secret amongst plus-sized women, Spanx products have become prized accessories flaunted by the Kardashians, Oprah and suburban moms. Spanx's selling point is that it helps smart, successful women of all ages to build their confidence by, well, looking good. But playing with fire might be a more adequate metaphor when we consider that less than half a century ago, women denounced Spanx-like garments as symbols of oppressive beauty standards. When women got rid of girdles and garter belts en masse in the 1960s, they didn't only reject restricting undergarments. (And restrict they did; it's hard to ride a bike, perform surgery or even breathe, as Adele learned, when your midsection is squeezed tight). They also rejected a society in which women were underemployed, underpaid and underappreciated. Throwing away girdles and curlers seemed like the dawn of a new era. Women got jobs, demanded equal pay and learned to be as tough as their male peers. Fifty years later, the girdle-like Spanx is back thanks to Sara Blakely, a brilliant woman who built a multimillion empire. Blakely used $5,000 to start a brand that defines its category, shapewear. She owns 100% of a company that turns a handsome profit. She is the youngest female self-made billionaire in the world. She would be a darling of the women's movement if her innovation wasn't antithetical to everything else it stood for. The twist is that Spanx prides itself on empowering women. The tagline for its In-Power panties that promise to whittle your waist, firm your figure and amp up your look is ""powerful women wear powerful panties."" The company's catalog proclaims: ""Tame your tummy and create an hourglass silhouette with Super Higher Power, our new comfortable yet powerful high-waisted hosiery shaper.... Now, you've got the power!"" Translation: Powerful women tame unsightly bulges. Say bye-bye to bad body image talk . It wasn't supposed to be this way. The protesters who descended upon Atlantic City in 1968 to picket the Miss America pageant weren't clamoring for more comfortable girdles. They wanted to change the rules of the game, telling women that their power lay in their heads, not in their bras and panties. What the 1968 protesters fought for still matters today. Despite huge progress, our society is not a post-feminist era. Women earn less than 80 cents to a man's dollar, hold about 17% of the seats in Congress and represent 3.6% of Fortune-500 CEOs. Of course, women aren't marched to their lingerie drawers at gunpoint. They choose to spend $250 million a year on Spanx products alone. Some would argue they make a wise choice. While beauty standards have changed, women are still rewarded for boosting their appearance. Better-looking women are more likely to be hired and promoted than those who are less attractive. But when women think that they can have both their Spanx and their paychecks, they miss the big picture. The culture that gave us Spanx holds us to impossible standards of beauty that even the sveltest women cannot meet (just think of all the Hollywood stars who are always trying to slim down). And it provides us with an impoverished sense of empowerment. Sadly, even women running for the highest office are not immune. Like the beautiful actresses who go the extra mile to put on their best appearance on the red carpet, politicians are as attuned to perceptions. Michele Bachmann, Sarah Palin and Hillary Clinton all upped their wardrobe ante when they stepped into the national spotlight. Ending up on People's worst-dressed list could be as embarrassing for a politician as for a starlet. Of course, we can't blame Spanx or Blakely for any of this. All of us are to blame. With our dollars, we support the very object that constrains us. When we wear shapewear, we buy into messages that equate women's power and abilities to the size and shape of their silhouettes. Little wonder that a woman of Adele's caliber felt the pressure, too. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Orit Avishai.","British pop star Adele wore four pairs of Spanx at the Grammys .

"(CNN) -- Jacqueline Kennedy's personal and heartfelt letters to an Irish priest about her marriage, faith and the 1963 death of her husband will no longer be sold at auction, according to the Irish auction house in charge of the event. ""Sheppard's is in the process of returning the archive, and items related to the archive, which had been consigned to the auction, to the vendor,"" Sheppard's Irish Auction House announced this week on its website. The trove of letters to the Rev. Joseph Leonard from a young Jacqueline Bouvier and later a married Jackie Kennedy offers a rare and revealing glimpse of the private thoughts of one of America's most admired first ladies. They were put up for auction by All Hallows College in Dublin, Ireland, which is run by the Catholic Church's Vincentian Fathers, according to the Catholic News Service. The college did not say why it decided to withdraw the letters from auction, according to the Catholic News Service report, but it said it's working with the Kennedy family to determine their fate. ""Representatives of All Hallows College and the Vincentian Fathers are now exploring with members of Mrs. Kennedy's family how best to preserve and curate this archive for the future,"" All Hallows College said in a statement provided to the news service. In her letters, Jackie Kennedy -- who died in 1994 -- wrote of her feelings of love, her concerns about the flirtatious nature of her husband, President John F. Kennedy, and later, her struggle with faith after Kennedy's assassination in November 1963. She met Leonard on a trip to Ireland in 1950, and from that time until his death in 1964, she wrote him more than two dozen letters. She was 21 when her correspondence began with 73-year-old Leonard, and her letters to the priest showed the value she placed on their relationship. The correspondence also revealed intimate details about her early relationship with the dashing young politician she would later marry. ""If he ever does ask me to marry him, it will be for rather practical reasons -- because his career is this driving thing with him,"" she wrote in one letter of her future husband's political ambitions. A 1952 letter, written the year before the couple wed, showed her understanding of Kennedy's philandering ways, which continued in the White House. ""He's like my father in a way -- loves the chase and is bored with the conquest -- and once married needs proof he's still attractive, so flirts with other women and resents you,"" she wrote. ""I saw how that nearly killed Mummy."" She also wondered about the glitzy life she lived, writing that ""maybe I'm just dazzled and picture myself in a glittering world of crowned heads and Men of Destiny -- and not just a sad little housewife."" She added, ""That world can be very glamorous from the outside -- but if you're in it -- and you're lonely -- it could be a Hell."" Read more: Details on the revealing letters .

"(CNN) -- National Democratic leaders, fresh from a shellacking in congressional districts and statehouses from coast to coast, should wake up to the reality that the party's path to electoral power runs through the streets, where an energized portion of the party's base has been marching for many months. On three hot-button issues -- climate change, higher pay for fast-food workers and fairness in the criminal justice system -- left-leaning Americans have mounted sophisticated, passionate campaigns that have sparked and swayed public conversation. The question is whether Democrats, whose electoral losses can be traced back to low voter participation, will follow the lead of activists whose numbers have been swelling throughout 2014. Right now, things don't look too hopeful. Instead of drawing on the energy and creativity of the activists, Democratic leaders are engaging in a round of finger-pointing, blaming one another for errors of timing and messaging that contributed to the recent electoral losses. Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, who as chairman of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee had the task of developing a winning message for the party this year, recently delivered an extraordinary speech chastising his fellow Dems for pursuing President Obama's signature issue of health care reform. ""Unfortunately, Democrats blew the opportunity the American people gave them. We took their mandate and put all of our focus on the wrong problem â€” health care reform,"" Schumer said in a speech at the National Press Club. ""We should have done it. We just shouldn't have done it first."" That drew a sharp retort from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. ""We come here to do a job, not keep a job,"" she said in a statement to CNN. ""There are more than 14 million reasons why that's wrong,"" she added -- a pointed reference to the number of Americans now getting health insurance under Obamacare. The feud is music to the ears of Republicans. ""Democrats are trying to figure out what they believe and who they represent"" is how conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer put it. That may be overstating matters -- this isn't the ""civil war"" Krauthammer describes -- but Democrats clearly need to think about how and why they haven't been connecting with voters lately. Schumer and Pelosi are both partly right. There's no question that the titanic battle to extend health care to the uninsured was always a matter of helping a minority of Americans to finally get benefits that 85% of us already enjoyed. Most people, anyway you look at it, did not need Obamacare themselves (although many had children and other relatives who benefited). But as Pelosi and others pointedly reminded Schumer, getting health benefits to 14 million people is a titanic achievement that Democrats have been attempting for a generation. And the program helped Democrats make inroads with Latino voters, whose support for Obamacare helped the Democrats carry the White House and hold a Senate majority in 2012. But the bickering on Capitol Hill misses an important point: The 2014 elections had the lowest turnout since World War II, meaning the issues and candidates that Democrats (and Republicans) put forward didn't stir the overwhelming majority of voters. At the same time, activists have enjoyed far greater success shaping issues and putting them on the public agenda: a track record Democrats would do well to learn from. On September 21, less than 60 days before the anemic-turnout election, more than 300,000 people marched in New York, according to an estimate by the organizers -- and more than 2,600 events were staged in solidarity around the world -- to call attention to the perils of climate change. On December 4, thousands of fast-food employees walked off the job in 190 cities across 35 states to demand better pay. And we haven't seen the end of nationwide civil rights demonstrations calling attention to controversial cases of police killing unarmed black boys and men. Athletes, politicians, at least one police chief, as well as the president of Harvard  and dozens of congressional staff members have all made public displays of solidarity under the banner #BlackLivesMatter. There's no shortage of movements that have caught fire across the nation. If Democrats want to get beyond this year's low-turnout losses, they should get serious about understanding why politically active Americans seem to be choosing picket lines over polling sites -- and then tailor a message that can lead to victory in 2016 and beyond.","Errol Louis says activists stage big protests but Democratic leaders aren't listening .

"(CNN) -- The President of the United States is the most powerful person on Earth, and one of the most threatened. This particular resident, Barack Obama, was the target of an unprecedented number of death threats upon taking office -- three times as many as his predecessors, according to press reports. (I can't think of why that might be). So you'd think that, at a minimum, the house where he lives would be surrounded by a fence that was hard to climb over. But as Julia Pierson, the Director of the Secret Service, noted in testimony today before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Congressional, six people have successfully scaled the fence this year alone. The reason for the hearing was one particular fence jumper, an apparently disturbed man named Omar Gonzales. On September 19, Gonzales not only scaled the fence, he ran across the lawn, through the White House's front door (which was unlocked), got past a Secret Service agent stationed at the door, went through the entry hall and into the East Room, and was finally apprehended near the door to the Green Room. We also learned this week details of an even more troubling incident in 2011, in which a man in a car fired seven shots that hit the White House. It turned out that in the moments after, agents were told by a supervisor to stand down because the sounds they had heard were not in fact gunshots; the damage from the bullets wasn't discovered until four days later. Security lapse: Armed man was in elevator with Obama . The Secret Service would say that thousands of times a year, agents successfully protect the President, other American officials, and foreign dignitaries, both in the United States and around the world, which is perfectly true. But at a time when we spend billions of dollars every year on what has come to be known as ""security theater"" -- procedures and practices whose effect is less to make us safe than to give the appearance of security -- this is one thing you'd think they'd be able to get right. Indeed, protecting the President is one of the few areas where the danger of overreaction is limited. The threats are real, and the task is specific. When it comes to the public at large, we've overreacted plenty in the past, particularly since the September 11 attacks. We all take our shoes off in airports, show IDs to get into office buildings, and are generally treated as though we are constantly in imminent danger from terrorists -- when the truth is that there are few things less likely to kill you. And that's not to mention the enormous apparatus of surveillance the government has built over that time, the details of which we still don't fully understand. Meanwhile, crime has been on a decades-long decline, while gun advocates tell everyone to buy more weaponry lest the barbarian horde attack their homes. In short, we fear the wrong things and overreact to threats that are real, but small. While the days when any citizen with a complaint could walk into the White House and give the President a piece of his mind are long past, we still want our leaders to come out and shake our hands. We want to be able to tour the Capitol Building. The area within view of the White House is the site for protests, speeches, and innumerable tourists taking photos, all of which we want to maintain. If we wanted, we could lock down the White House -- eliminate tours for the public, put up 40-foot steel and concrete barriers, maybe park some tanks on the lawn. During today's hearing, Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, argued that anyone scaling the fence and running toward the White House should be shot, which would mean a lot of bullets flying outward toward those tourists. This incident was certainly disturbing, and the congressional pressure the Secret Service is now receiving may lead to some salutary change. But just as we're now questioning the tragedies large and small that come from police officers all over the country treating every citizen like a soldier in an enemy army, we should be careful about not going too far in turning the White House into a fortress. We could make the building impenetrable, but but that would represent the loss of something valuable. By all means, the Secret Service should examine its procedures to make sure nothing like this happens again. They should put up a better fence. Maybe keeping the front door of the White House locked wouldn't be a bad idea. But this is a good time to remember that there's a tension in any democracy between security and openness, and in America, of late -- the occasional screw-up notwithstanding -- too much openness isn't our problem.","Paul Waldman: Secret Service director faced lawmakers over White House security breaches .

"Mountain View, United States (CNN) -- Google ""Marissa Mayer"" and the first key words that come up are ""net worth"" and ""salary"" -- terms that reflect her fame as one of the world's most powerful women. Mayer joined internet giant Google as a 24-year-old in 1999; one of the company's first 20 hires and its first female engineer. In 2010, she moved from heading up Search Products and User Experience to become VP of Local, Maps and Localization Services, the company's next key growth area. Mayer prides herself on being able to pick trends, both on and offline. ""Back in about 2003, I correctly called cupcakes as a major trend. It was a business prediction, but it's been widely interpreted as [that] I just like them. (Truth is, there's other sweets I like far more, like vanilla fudge)."" She says the science of search engines -- information retrieval -- is still in its infancy. ""It's like physics in the 1600s or biology in the 1800s. There's big breakthroughs all the time. Now you can find photos in addition to web pages, books in addition to photos. Now it's personalized. They're the kinds of breakthroughs that happen early in the science."" Not only is the quantity of information in the world increasing -- by Mayer's last count, there are now 582 million websites, up from 10 in 1991, the year the internet was made public -- but the forms that information takes is also multiplying. Search capabilities must grow and adapt in tandem with the new forms of media we use. Video has been the latest format to proliferate online, and Mayer predicts the next push will be into new search modes and personalization. Voice searching, which didn't exist a few years ago, now comprises almost 25% of the searches done on Android devices. As of June last year, Google experiences more Google Maps traffic on mobile than on desktop. One of Google's newest products, launched in November, brings mapping technology indoors. ""Now, in some of the 'big-box retailers,' or inside of malls or office buildings, we actually have the internal layout, and we actually can put the blue dot in the right spot. So if you're looking for a conference room or a particular department in an Ikea, you can see 'Oh, I'm here.'"" After graduating in 1999 with a Masters in Computer Science from Stanford University, Mayer received 14 job offers. She chose to work at Google during a spring break period in which, she says, she made all the decisions she is most proud of. ""Those decisions all had two things in common: I always surrounded myself with the smartest people I could find, because they make you think about things harder. ""And I always did something I was a little not ready to do. I think that's how you grow. When there's that moment of 'Wow, I'm not really sure I can do this,' and you push through those moments, that's when you have a breakthrough. Sometimes that's a sign that something really good is about to happen. You're about to grow and learn a lot about yourself."" In order to push yourself out of your comfort zone, though, Mayer recommends you first find an environment that's comfortable. ""I'm a really shy person, yet at Google, my colleagues would never believe that; because here, I'm outspoken, because I feel like I can express my opinions and find my voice."" Besides nurturing self belief, Mayer says it's also important to work for people who believe in you. She advises seeking out mentors ""who aren't just looking at what they can get from you in order to advance the company, but are also investing in you and what you're going to be doing in 10 years and preparing you for that next step."" More from Leading Women: Women! Embrace your inner geek . A proud ""geek,"" for whom the word just means ""for an area that you're passionate about, all the details matter,"" Mayer worries that stereotypes about computer scientists might hinder women from working in technology. ""There is such a stereotype of the hacker; the pasty-skinned guy with the thick glasses, the pocket protector, the blue glow coming off of the monitor ... people think if they're going to be good at this, that's what they need to be. You can be good at technology and like fashion and art. You can be good at technology and be a jock. You can be good at technology and be a mom. You can do it your way, on your terms."" Ultimately, being a geek can triumph over gender. ""I'm not a woman at Google, I'm a geek at Google,"" Mayer says. ""If you can find something that you're really passionate about, whether you're a man or a woman comes a lot less into play. Passion is a gender-neutralizing force.""","Marissa Mayer was Google's first female engineer and one of its first 20 hires .

"(CNN) -- A Colorado woman told authorities she was using Facebook in another room when her infant son drowned in a bathtub, according to an arrest affidavit. Shannon Johnson, 34, was arrested January 11 on one count of child abuse by knowingly and recklessly causing a death, said Jennifer Finch, community relations director for the Weld County District Attorney's Office. If convicted, the Fort Lupton resident could face a sentence of 16 to 48 years, Finch said. ""This is an extremely tragic incident,"" Undersheriff Margie Martinez told HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell. According to the Weld County Sheriff's Office affidavit, the child died on September 20, 2010. The infant, not named in the affidavit, was 13 months old, according to CNN affiliate KUSA. The autopsy listed anoxic brain injury, cardiac arrest and drowning as the cause of death. Johnson said she put the child in the tub in the morning after he ate and played, according to the affidavit. The water was a little higher than normal, it added. Court documents indicate the infant had been treated for a seizure about a month before his death. ""The Defendant admitted that she was on Facebook playing a game called Cafe World, checking on friends' status and sharing videos, in the living room, while [the infant] was in the bathtub,"" according to the affidavit. The woman checked on the infant once and found him playing. After about three more minutes, ""she didn't hear [the boy] playing, she went in to check on him and saw him sideways with his face in the water,"" the affidavit states. The boy was later airlifted to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead, according to authorities. Johnson told investigators that starting two weeks before the incident, she would leave the boy alone in the tub, according to the affidavit. Asked why, she said ""she started doing this when he really wanted to be left alone; he was a very independent baby. She also said she knew what it was like to be told no, she didn't want her baby to be told no and didn't want him to be known as a mama's boy."" She acknowledged leaving the infant alone ""was so stupid,"" according to the affidavit. Johnson's mother told investigators she had spoken with her daughter about leaving the child in the bathtub, but the defendant couldn't recall the conversation, according to the affidavit. A search of the residence showed a laptop on a couch in the living area, according to the affidavit. The screen was showing a Facebook page. Johnson was being held Tuesday on $100,000 bond, according to Finch.  A bond hearing is scheduled for January 31. A phone number for Johnson's residence did not work Tuesday. A call to the Weld County Public Defender's office was not immediately returned. CNN's Phil Gast contributed to this report.","Shannon Johnson is accused of child abuse by causing a death .

"(CNN) -- The underwater probe being used to look for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 was back in the water after its first attempt ended prematurely, said the company that owns the vehicle, Phoenix International. The Bluefin-21 autonomous underwater vehicle was about four hours into its second dive mission at 2 p.m. ET on Tuesday (2 a.m. Wednesday in Perth, Australia), a source close to the operation told CNN's Brian Todd. On Monday, crews sent the probe toward the ocean floor on what was expected to be a 20-hour deployment, only to have it return in less than eight hours after encountering waters beyond its 4,500-meter (14,764-foot) maximum depth. The probe found no debris during its shortened scanning session. The second mission is expected to end Wednesday around 10 a.m. ET (10 p.m. in Perth), the source said. The vehicle was deployed in nearly the same area and is operating at about the same depth as the earlier mission, the source said. The earlier aborted mission doesn't mean anything is wrong with the probe, which is designed to swim about 30 meters (100 feet) above the ocean floor and use sound waves to draw a three-dimensional map of what lies below. ""The vehicle's tracking the floor, so when the floor dives, so does the vehicle. And the vehicle goes, 'Uh oh, I'm not supposed to be here' and punches up,"" said David Gallo, director of special projects at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. And while it's disappointing the vehicle returned to the surface early, it's not unusual, said David Kelly, CEO of Bluefin Robotics, the company that makes the probe. ""We've operated these vehicles around the globe. It's not unusual to get into areas where the charts aren't accurate or you lack information,"" Kelly told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront."" A British survey ship is working to determine the areas where the Bluefin can safely work without hitting its maximum dive depth, according to Phoenix. U.S. Navy Capt. Mark Mathews of the Bluefin search team said the initial launch Monday night took place ""in the very far corner of the area it's searching, so they are just shifting the search box a little bit away from that deep water and proceeding with the search."" About 8 square miles were searched, said Jim Gibson, a spokesman for Phoenix International. It could take up to two months to scan the entire search area. The deputy director for salvage and diving for the U.S. Navy told CNN that the Bluefin may actually be able to go deeper than it was first programmed to do, engineers have determined. ""We've gone through and looked at all of the components in Bluefin, and we're comfortable that we can exceed that 4,500-meter limit at this point,"" Mike Dean told CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper. ""We're looking at, can we push Bluefin beyond 4,500, potentially down to as deep as 5,000? There is some software, that software has been tested now. And we believe that, with some confidence, we could push Bluefin to that depth."" He said two-thirds of the search area was less than 4,500 meters deep. Dean said the Bluefin was chosen for this part of the search because it was the lightest, most nimble package and easiest to get on scene. It's possible that a second vehicle that can operate deeper than the Bluefin will be needed. One possibility is a vehicle called Orion that is towed behind a ship. It remains under the water and sends back real-time data. It would be a more complex operation to put an Orion in the water but one is available in Maryland if the Australian-led search team requests it. Monday's shortened mission was the latest glitch in a 40-day search for the missing jetliner, which vanished March 8 with 239 passengers and crew on board after taking off from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, bound for Beijing. Surface and satellite searches have turned up nothing conclusive -- and confusing, sometimes conflicting details from investigators have muddied the public image of the search and angered relatives of the missing. On Tuesday, the Malaysian Cabinet agreed to set up an international investigation to look into the plane's disappearance. Teams will look at the plane's airworthiness, operational issues and human factors that may have played a role, officials said. Malaysia's acting Transportation Minister Hishammuddin Hussein also said Tuesday that if searchers are able to recover the plane's vital black boxes, it matters less which country takes control of them than does ""finding out the truth."" Oceanic salvage manager: How we search for Flight 370 . The co-pilot's cell phone . Meanwhile, a new detail emerged from the flight on Monday. A U.S. official told CNN that co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid's cell phone was on and made contact with a cell tower in Malaysia about the time the plane disappeared from radar. However, the U.S. official -- who cited information shared by Malaysian investigators -- said there was no evidence Hamid had tried to make a call. The official told CNN's Pamela Brown on Monday that a cell phone tower in Penang, Malaysia -- about 250 miles from where the flight's transponder last sent a signal -- detected the first officer's phone searching for service roughly 30 minutes after authorities believe the plane made a sharp turn westward. The details do appear to reaffirm suggestions, based on radar and satellite data, that the plane was off course and was probably flying low enough to obtain a signal from a cell tower, the U.S. official said. U.S. officials familiar with the investigation told CNN they have been told that no other cell phones were picked up by the Penang tower. Pilots are supposed to turn off their cell phones before pushing back from the gate. When the plane first went missing, authorities said millions of cell phone records were searched, looking for evidence that calls had been made from the plane after it took off, but the search turned up nothing. The suspected oil slick . Another possible clue into the plane's disappearance appeared Monday. Australian officials announced the Australian ship Ocean Shield had detected an oil slick Sunday evening. It is unclear where the oil came from; a 2-liter sample has been collected for examination, and was on its way Tuesday to western Australia for analysis. Test results could be days away. CNN aviation analyst Les Abend, who flies a Boeing 777, said the engines on the plane have about 20 quarts of oil each. ""It could be slowly dripping up to the surface,"" he told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360."" ""They're saying an oil slick. I'm wondering if it's just some sort of a fluid slick. It could be (from) hydraulics."" If it is oil, it's not the first oil slick detected as part of the search. A similar find in the first days of the search was determined to be fuel oil from a freighter. Surface search nearing end . While air and sea surface searches continued Wednesday some 2,087 kilometers (1,297 miles) northwest of Perth, those searches are likely nearing an end. ""The air and surface search for floating material will be completed in the next two to three days in the area where the aircraft most likely entered the water,"" retired Australian Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, head of the country's Joint Agency Coordination Centre, said Monday. With no debris found after weeks of searches and no possible pings from the plane's black boxes detected in a week, Houston said it was time to focus the search underwater. The number of aircraft in the search grew to 14 planes, including three civilian jets. There were also 11 ships involved Wednesday. How do underwater sonar subs work?

"(CNN) -- Oh, to be a fly on the wall when this photo of Angelina Jolie was taken. On Wednesday at the Hollywood Reporter's Women in Entertainment breakfast, Jolie was photographed running into Amy Pascal, the Sony Pictures co-chairwoman whose emails were published by Gawker this week after a massive hack of Sony's private data. CNNMoney: What to know about the Sony mega-hack . Those emails have gone viral thanks to their insider information and very blunt chatter about actors like Jolie, who was called ""minimally talented"" and a ""spoiled brat"" with a ""rampaging ... ego"" by producer Scott Rudin. One would imagine that by the time Pascal ran into Jolie at Wednesday's Hollywood Reporter event, the actress-director herself would have heard about them. CNNMoney: Bringing down Sony was frighteningly easy . It's hard to tell from the picture whether that's true, but that hasn't stopped the Internet from speculating. In the image, Pascal approaches Jolie as though she's going in for a hug, wearing a facial expression that could be read as apologetic. Jolie, meanwhile, meets Pascal's gaze with a deadly serious expression. It isn't clear what kind of exchange the two women had on Wednesday -- perhaps after the picture was snapped, they embraced with smiles. But one thing's for sure: This is one photo worth a thousand words. CNNMoney: Sony hack: Next Bond movie is WAY over budget . Jolie isn't the only famous name who's been implicated in the hacking scandal. In another leaked email, comedian and actor Kevin Hart was called a ""whore"" by one Sony exec for wanting more money to promote a movie on social media beyond the $3 million he was receiving for the project. ""I'm not saying he's a whore, but he's a whore,"" the exec said, according to an email published by Gawker. On Instagram on Thursday, Hart appeared to respond to the PR nightmare, telling his fans that he knows his worth. ""I look at myself as a brand,"" Hart said, ""and because of that, I will never be taken advantage of."" The fallout from Sony's leaked messages has even reached into politics, as one of Pascal and Rudin's leaked email exchanges included controversial jokes about President Obama. Pascal, who was set to attend a breakfast with the President and other Hollywood executives, emailed Rudin to get his opinion on what she should ask Obama. ""Would he like to finance some movies,"" Rudin responded. Pascal emailed back, ""I doubt it. Should I ask him if he liked ('Django Unchained')?"" ""12 YEARS,"" was Rudin's response, setting up a back-and-forth in which the two threw out movies starring African-Americans. When Pascal suggested that maybe it's Lee Daniels' ""The Butler"" that the President would be partial to, Rudin responded, ""Ride-along. I bet he likes Kevin Hart."" Suffice it to say the fallout has not been pretty. Both Pascal and Rudin have apologized for their remarks about Obama, and Pascal has reportedly reached out to leaders like Al Sharpton and the Rev. Jesse Jackson with a desire to ""accept responsibility"" for her comments.","A photo of Angelina Jolie and Amy Pascal has prompted speculation .

"(CNN) -- The apparent resumption of forced ""virginity tests"" by security forces in Egypt has dashed activists' hopes for democratic reforms and fueled fears of a return to police brutality and abuse reminiscent of the Hosni Mubarak-era. Four women arrested in recent months for taking part in anti-military protests have said they were subjected to virginity tests by the police whilst in custody. First-hand accounts of their traumatic experience -- published by the social news website BuzzFeed last week -- prompted an outcry from local and international rights groups angered by what some groups have described as ""atrocious crimes"" committed by the state since the ouster of former Islamist President Mohamed Morsy in July. The virginity checks allegedly performed on the female detainees signal the return of a practice aimed at humiliating and terrorizing women protesters. One of the women who says she was forced to undergo a virginity test in January while she was in detention at Qanater Prison told Buzzfeed: ""I thought the tests were history. I thought we had left them behind in the days of Mubarak."" Pattern of abuse . In December 2011, activists had celebrated after the Cairo Administrative Court ordered an end to the shameful procedure, declaring it illegal in Egypt. The verdict was seen as a victory for Samira Ibrahim, the young activist who had filed a legal complaint against the military after she and at least six other female protesters were subjected to virginity checks performed by a military doctor on March 9, 2011. ""We performed the tests to prove that the girls were not virgins so that they would not accuse the army of rape later on,"" a high-ranking general told me in a telephone interview on May 30, 2011. It was the first admission from a military general that the tests had been performed, reversing earlier denials by the army that they had happened. However, in March 2012, a military court acquitted the military doctor charged with performing virginity tests, on grounds of ""conflicting testimony."" His acquittal was seen by rights activists as a blow for any hopes of accountability for the abuses women had suffered at the hands of the military. Analysts and rights advocates say the virginity checks are part of a pattern of abuse practiced by the State Security Service that was reportedly dismantled after the January 2011 revolution but that has now returned. Since military-backed protests led to Morsy's overthrow, thousands of Muslim Brotherhood members and supporters have been arrested and an estimated 1,400 people have been killed in political violence. Many of the deaths were caused by ""excessive and unwarranted use of force by the police and military,"" according to Amnesty International. In recent months, the security crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood -- designated by Egypt as a terrorist organization in December-- has widened, targeting dissenters of all stripes including secular activists and journalists. Reports of torture . Many Egyptians have turned a blind eye to the rights abuses committed by the security forces against Brotherhood supporters and some even condone the killings as necessary to rid the country of the the people they call terrorists whose aim, they say, is to destroy Egypt and plunge it into chaos. In recent weeks, there has been an increase in reports of torture of political detainees, many of them based on testimonies of the prisoners themselves. Earlier this month, Interior Minister Mohamed Ibrahim issued a statement denying allegations of torture or sexual assault by police. Ibrahim said several human rights organizations had visited prisons in Egypt and met with inmates and he welcomed further requests from groups wanting to check the conditions for themselves. A police officer working for the Ministry of Interior's media department (who requested to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to speak to the media) said that those who make such allegations were ""enemies of the state"" who wanted to damage relations between the people and the police. In a televised address to the nation broadcast on July 3 -- hours after Morsy was toppled -- Defense Minister General Abdel Fattah El Sisi promised a democratic transition and an inclusive government. He has delivered neither. Riding high on a wave of nationalist fervor, he is widely expected to announce his presidential candidacy in the coming days. While he is being touted as ""the nation's savior"" to bring stability, his potential candidacy is certain to deepen the polarization and increase political turmoil in the country. Atmosphere of fear and uncertainty . El Sisi has said Morsy's ouster has saved Egypt from civil war but a surge in apparent revenge bomb attacks by jihadi groups targeting security installations and checkpoints across the country since then is evidence to the contrary. Indeed, the fear barrier was broken during the January 2011 revolution and young revolutionary activists believe the trend is irreversible. They insist their revolution -- ""hijacked by Islamists and subsequently, by the military"" -- will continue despite the setbacks. But with a draconian law in place, criminalizing protests without prior permission from the police, the activists' mission has been made difficult. They have been left with no alternative but to turn to social media networks to garner public support for their campaign. Security agencies meanwhile, have made no secret of the fact that these networks are now heavily monitored, increasing the risk of arrest of internet activists critical of the government. And with the traditional pro-military media continuing to communicate messages that incite hatred of Islamists and spread fear among the public, an overwhelming majority of Egyptians have decided to back the military's return to power. It is in this atmosphere of uncertainty and fear that the virginity tests have made a comeback. Few Egyptians are willing to speak out against the degrading practice and other rights violations. Many of them say they cannot afford to forsake security and stability for democratic principles and human rights. One of the detainees who says she was recently subjected to a virginity test whilst in custody told BuzzFeed ""The people have forgotten what the army did to us in 2011. El Sisi supported the virginity tests for those girls in Tahrir,"" she said. To her and other opposition activists, the overwhelming popular support for the military is both bewildering and frustrating. Explore: Press freedom in the Middle East .

"(CNN) -- My mother rarely talked with me about the birds and the bees when I was growing up, and I always knew that no matter what, when I became a parent, I'd be more open with my children about sex. With my girls in the second and third grade, I figured in the not too distant future it would be time for the ""sex talk."" But now I'm wondering if I need to have the conversation a lot sooner than I had originally thought and if the whole concept of having a ""sex talk"" is as outdated as the BlackBerry I still won't give up. ""In some ways, I think the 'tech talk' is replacing the 'sex talk' because our kids are learning about sex from tech,"" said Diana Graber, who teaches ""cyber civics"" at a middle school in Aliso Viejo, California. Once children know how to Google, Graber says, they can easily stumble upon sexual images. ""Sex"" and even ""porn"" have also been found to be among the more popular words searched by 7-year-olds, she added, as shocking as that might sound. ""We're giving children access to smartphones, tablets, and all sorts of digital devices so young,"" said Graber, who is co-founder of CyberWise.org, a digital literacy site for parents, educators, and tweens and teens. ""There is a good chance they will be exposed to inappropriate content before they're probably ready to have that 'sex talk' that we used to have at 10 and 11. That's why I think having the 'tech talk' first is so important."" Graber says it's not one talk but ""a million small talks,"" which begin the moment we put a connected device into our child's hands. ""What I always tell parents is it's not the technical stuff that they need to know. It's the behavioral things, and it's age old things like being nice online and being wise and not saying mean things, protecting privacy and don't talk to strangers and all those ... golden rules,"" said Graber. ""Like the golden rules, they weren't delivered to me all at once. They were delivered again and again and again throughout my lifetime."" An unprecedented summit . Helping parents have the ""tech talk"" with their children was a huge motivation behind a recent summit of parents, teachers, administrators and students in New Rochelle, a community about 30 minutes outside New York City. Christine Coleman, director of technology for the city school district of New Rochelle, said the event was designed to help parents teach children how to make good choices on social media and to really think about what they're doing before they do it. ""I always say this to parents, 'Would you allow your child on the subway at two in the morning?' "" said Coleman, who holds a doctorate in computer science and education. ""No. We teach our children to make good choices. So you need to teach them to make good choices with social media."" Coleman says one of the biggest challenges for parents is talking about a topic that they might not feel they know much about. ""I equate it to those conversations about sex,"" she said. ""They're very hard to have. They're uncomfortable to have, and ... with social media, parents are uncomfortable because they're not knowledgeable about it but if we use our children to teach us ... and explain it to us, it begins a different type of conversation."" 'I heard about this Twitter' Coleman encourages parents to plunge right in by picking any social network (there are certainly plenty to choose from!) and starting a discussion with your child. ""Sit down with your child and say, 'I heard about this Twitter. Don't laugh at me. Show me on your phone. You are not going to get in trouble. I'm not looking at it. I just don't understand what all this tweeting is?' "" she said. ""And then you start the dialogue. 'OK, is that what it does? ... Does it ever get mean?' "" she said. ""Then end it with, 'That's really kind of cool. Can you set me up with a Twitter? Can you tweet me?' Once they start tweeting you, you are involved in their world now."" Graber said what she hears from the sixth graders she teaches is that despite what parents might think, children want them to take an interest in their online lives. ""One little girl said, 'I wish my mom was following me on Instagram,' or 'I wish my mom had looked at what I posted but she just isn't interested or she doesn't know,' and they're sad,"" said Graber. ""It's a small window where they feel like that and then it closes, largely when they become teenagers, and then we're not part of that world."" 'This isn't about not reading their kids' journal' Brian Osborne is superintendent of the New Rochelle city school district and was a key force behind his district convening its first ever digital literacy summit. He says research shows that parents will interact with their children's online lives, but mainly related to the expense of the smartphone, setting limits on data or online purchases. ""Parents are not having enough high quality conversations with their kids about what their online interactions actually entail,"" said Osborne. ""Lots of time parents have a well-intended but not fully informed respect for their children's privacy online and what we need parents to understand is this isn't about not reading their kids' journal or diary out of a sense of respect and privacy. This is equivalent to knowing where your kid is."" Graber, the digital literacy teacher, says if you are talking to a child because there's a problem and ""it's the first conversation you've had, then that's the real problem. There should have been a lot of conversations."" Liz Gumbinner, publisher and editor-in-chief of the site Cool Mom Tech, which has been talking about the importance of the 'tech talk' for years, said that as soon as your kids are old enough to tap on your smartphone screen, the conversations should begin. ""Use parental controls on your devices; set limits on what they can and can't see -- and be really honest and open about it,"" said Gumbinner, a mom of two girls, ages 7 and 9. ""Let them know what you are doing and why. If you start talking to your kids early about tech, they'll understand you're making decisions in their best interests."" The ""tech talk"" has to be an on-going conversation, in part, because technology itself is always changing, said Gumbinner. ""As soon as we think we've mastered one thing, something totally new pops up. And the really hard thing is that kids are learning about social apps and networks way before we are,"" she added. ""So keep an eye on your kids' computer time and Internet usage, know who they're communicating with and be honest about it. It's not spying if you talk about it openly."" Do you think the ""tech talk"" should replace the ""sex talk""?

"(CNN) -- From the scorched corn fields of Kansas, to the storm-lashed hills of Nicaragua, an increasingly volatile climate is posing ever greater challenges for farmers around the world. But opportunity is arising from crisis, through next-generation climate analysis tools that could make agriculture - the world's largest industry - vastly more efficient and profitable. The Climate Corporation, founded by two ex-Google engineers, is dragging a famously technophobic industry into the digital era. Through exhaustive data modeling and an elite pool of climate and agriculture analysts, the Corporation is seeking to take guesswork out of the field. ""The increasing uncertainty in agriculture, with the changing patterns of weather we are seeing, is making it difficult for farmers to grow successful crops consistently,"" says CEO David Friedberg. ""The tools we provide help farmers make smarter decisions based on analytical techniques, rather than intuition."" Data revolution . Friedberg sees ""huge opportunities"" to revolutionize a vast industry that employs over one billion people and occupies almost half the planet's total land, but has not adapted to the possibilities of data, despite its vulnerability to climate change. The Climate Corporation's model produces hyper-local climate forecasts for individual farms, using satellite imaging, growth modeling and simulations. This is supported by decades of data, much of it from government sources, covering crop performance, soil properties, moisture levels and weather. The free ""Basic"" platform allows farmers to monitor their land and crops, while the ""Climate Pro"" platform includes a suite of features such as to optimize use of nitrogen fertilizer, control pests, and plan perfect harvests. ""Fertilizer is the number one expense for farmers and they are basically throwing away money,"" says Friedberg. ""We can help farmers decide how much fertilizer to put in the field at what point in the season, reducing what goes into the atmosphere and waterways, so that 100% goes to plants to deliver food."" While Friedberg is a strict vegetarian and keen to support environmental protection, his priority is to convince farmers with an economic argument. ""I don't see collective action on climate change in agriculture. We need to create commercial incentives to change behavior, that's where we can be successful."" The company estimate they can make $20 billion in efficiency savings in the U.S. by applying their data models, and increase corn field yields by 30% an acre. ""Our initial results show a 10-20% increase in yield,"" said Tim Malterer, a Minnesota farmer that uses the software. More with less . With the UN's agriculture body claiming that the food supply needs to increase 70% by 2050 to meet the needs of a growing population, without cultivating new farmland, there is an imperative for the industry to do more with less. The challenge is daunting but the Corporation's ambitions are on a global scale. Having been recently acquired by Monsanto in a $1 billion deal -- which Friedberg claims has not altered its work -- the group has vast resources. Its technology covers 50 million acres in the U.S., including a third of total land for corn and soybean, serving thousands of farmers. This figure is growing rapidly, and its platforms will be rolled out internationally from 2015. That level of adoption would enable dramatic changes in the industry. Friedberg would like to see farmers choosing different crops to suit the climate data -- such as switching from wheat to corn in Canada as the weather warms -- and planning five-season cycles that use a better understanding of the changing properties of soil. Optimal performance . The opportunities for data in agriculture are also shown by Edyn, a Californian startup that emerged from one of the state's worst ever droughts. ""Around the world, water stress has been one of first impacts of climate change on agriculture,"" says founder Jason Aramburu. ""But most farmers still haven't adopted water saving techniques."" With award-winning designer Yves Behar, Edyn produced a multi-faceted sensor that allows growers to micro-manage their plots, providing constant readings on moisture level, with a connected water valve that keeps the level optimal. It also gives readings of light, temperature, humidity and fertility so that even inexperienced users can sustain high performance yields. The device, which more than trebled its crowdfunding goal, is initially targeted at smaller growers. But Aramburu wants to build immense data sets from environmental input, which would scale to the needs of high volume food production. The sensor is undergoing trials with major farm operators. Aramburu is confident about the integration of data, but believes the industry must change now to protect livelihoods and the environment. ""It's a question of when, not if,"" he says. ""This is as big an opportunity as the Internet was, in one of the last big industries that has not adopted big data. ""If we do nothing, more farmers will have to leave their land over the next decades...which means creating new farmland, which would have a dramatic environmental impact."" Data modeling in agriculture has great potential, believes Mckenzie Funk, author of ""Windfall,"" an investigation of how businesses are adapting to climate change and in some cases seeking to exacerbate it. ""Hyper local data can't hurt macro farming, although it's still early for the science and we may not see the full effects for five or 10 years,"" says Funk. ""If efficiencies deliver profits that will be a major incentive for change."" Funk adds that improving efficiency of existing farmland would have less negative effects than cultivating new land, and hopes the concept is expanded. ""I don't think there's a problem with people making money from climate change. My only concern is whether the technology would be expanded to farmers everywhere, whether they can afford it in places like the Sahara, otherwise the effects (of climate change) will continue to get worse."" With the right information, even the most extreme conditions can be profitable. Read this: Tinder for business: Big data matchmaking transforms recruitment .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The Cecil Hotel's dark past earned it a spot on Los Angeles tours long before a woman's body was found inside its rooftop water tank. ""It's the place where serial killers stay,"" said tour guide Richard Schave. Schave and his wife, Kim Cooper, conduct a ""true crime and oddities"" tour they call ""Hotel Horrors & Main Street Vice."" The new mystery surrounding Elisa Lam's death will be added to Cooper's spiel during the tour stops at the Cecil Hotel, she said. Cooper and Schave have made it their job to compile details on those who have killed or been killed while staying at the Cecil. The killers . The most famous on their list are serial killers Richard Ramirez and Jack Unterweger. Ramirez, known as the ""Nightstalker,"" now resides on California's death row, but in 1985 he was living on the Cecil's top floor in a $14 a night room, Cooper said. The Cecil, filled then with hundreds of transients living in the cheap rooms, was a good place for Ramirez to go unnoticed as he killed 13 women, Schave said. He was ""just dumping his bloody clothes in the Dumpster at the end of his evening and going in the back entrance."" Jack Unterweger worked as a journalist covering Los Angeles crime for an Austrian magazine in 1991 when he moved into the Cecil. ""We believe he was living at the Cecil in homage to Ramirez,"" Schave said. He is blamed with killing three prostitutes in Los Angeles while a guest at the Cecil. The killed . During the 1950s and 1960s, the Cecil had a reputation as a place where people would kill themselves by jumping out upper-floor windows, Cooper said. ""It's just what people do when they are at the end of their rope,"" she said. Helen Gurnee, in her 50s, leaped from a seventh floor window, landing on the Cecil Hotel marquee on October 22, 1954, Cooper said. Julia Moore jumped from her eighth floor room window on February 11, 1962, she said. Moore left behind a bus ticket from St Louis, 59 cents and an Illinois bank account book showing a balance of $1,800.Â . Pauline Otton, 27, jumped from a ninth floor window after an argument with her estranged husband on October 12, 1962, Cooper said. Otton landed on George Gianinni, 65, who was walking on the sidewalk 90 feet below. Both were killed instantly. Not everyone on Cooper's list committed suicide. ""Pigeon Goldie"" Osgood, a retired telephone operator, was found dead in her ransacked room on June 4, 1964, Cooper said. Osgood, known for protecting and feeding the pigeons at nearby Pershing Square, was stabbed, strangled and raped. The crime has not been solved. Not an ordinary hotel . Schave and Cooper have theories about why the Cecil's past has been so sordid. It was built in the 1920s as a hotel ""for businessmen to come into town and spend a night or two,"" Cooper said. But it was soon upstaged by nicer hotels in a better part of town, she said. When the Great Depression hit in the 1930s, it became more of a transient hotel. Eventually, it transitioned into a single room occupancy business, known as an SRO. Long-term tenants rented individual rooms and shared bathrooms with neighboring residents. ""This was just a place where people who were really down on their luck were going,"" Schave said. ""These hotels are filled with people who are at the edge of being integrated in society."" During the 1970s, '80s and '90s, hundreds of people who were ""down on their luck"" called the Cecil home, he said. ""They were all hustling to make ends meet."" ""It's not like that any more, of course,"" Cooper said. New owners converted three of the floors back to hotel rooms around 2007, but most of the building remains SRO, Schave said. Another section serves as a hostel that is marketed toward European tourists, he said . It was not clear if Lam was staying in one of the hotel rooms, which offer more privacy, or the hostel. Repeated calls by CNN to the Cecil Hotel management were not returned Wednesday and Thursday.","Cecil Hotel is featured in ""Hotel Horrors & Main Street Vice"" tour .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Budgets spiraling out of control; cast and crew on the verge of collapse; sets destroyed: Just a few of the catastrophes to afflict the ill-fated productions in The Screening Room's Top 10 movie shoots from hell. Robert Duvall and Francis Ford Coppola on the set of ""Apocalypse Now."" A typhoon destroyed the sets during this notoriously difficult production. From ""Cleopatra"" to ""Apocalypse Now,"" these infamous productions have all been struck by extreme weather, tragedy, illness and sometimes death. Amazingly, despite the setbacks, these shoots didn't always result in failure. Some of these films are cinematic gems -- although this list has its fair share of flops as well. Don't agree? Think we've missed one? Let us know in the SoundOff box below. 1. 'Apocalypse Now'  (Francis Ford Coppola, 1979)  A typhoon that destroyed sets, illness and madness, all marred this notoriously difficult production in the Philippines. With no ending, an overweight Marlon Brando and his reputation on the line, Coppola withdrew into himself and the shoot spiraled out of control, according to his wife Eleanor, whose footage was used in making-of documentary ""Hearts of Darkness."" The shoot drove Coppola to breaking point and also took a toll on the cast -- star Martin Sheen suffered a heart attack aged 38. 2. 'Heaven's Gate' (Michael Cimino, 1980)  A disastrous Western that nearly brought down United Artists, the studio founded by Charlie Chaplin. Given free rein, Cimino overspent massively and the original budget of $8 million ballooned to a whopping $36 million. The historical drama eventually clocked in at three and a half hours. It was slammed by critics and bombed at the box office, paving the way for the sale of United Artists to MGM. Shaken by the extent of the failure, which is still considered one of the biggest in Hollywood history, studios clamped down on the freewheeling excesses of the 1970s and a new, more conservative era was born. 3. 'Fitzcarraldo' (Werner Herzog, 1982) During this life-threatening shoot, Herzog made cast and crew haul a steamship over a mountain to tell the story of an music fanatic who wants to build an opera house in jungle. Herzog, who didn't want to use special effects, hired local Indians to achieve the feat. As if the challenge of pulling a 320-ton boat wasn't enough to deal with, the production was plagued by heavy rains, casting problems -- lead actor Jason Robards had to be replaced by Klaus Kinski due to illness, while Mick Jagger dropped out due to a Rolling Stones concert -- and a border war that broke out between Peru and Ecuador. 4. 'Twilight Zone: The Movie' (John Landis, 1983) Tragedy hit the production of John Landis' feature film version of the TV series when a special-effects explosion caused a helicopter to lose control during a Vietnam War scene. Lead actor Vic Morrow and child actors Renee Chen and My-ca Dinh Le were killed when the helicopter crashed on them. Landis and other crew members were charged with involuntary manslaughter. All plead not guilty and were acquitted of the charges. 5. 'Cleopatra' (Joseph Mankiewicz, 1963)  The historical epic starring Elizabeth Taylor, Rex Harrison and Richard Burton nearly bankrupted 20th Century Fox. Shooting dragged on for years, with production being halted several times due to Taylor's illnesses. At one point, she nearly died after catching pneumonia and had to undergo an emergency tracheotomy. The movie had its fair share of scandal too, thanks to the affair Taylor and Burton started during filming. By the time the movie was finally finished, it had a new director (Joseph Mankiewicz signed on after Rouben Mamoulian resigned), was over schedule and way over budget. Some estimates put the final cost at $60 million, making it one of the most expensive movies ever made if translated into today's dollars. 6. 'The Man Who Killed Don Quixote' (Terry Gilliam, unfinished) Terry Gilliam's attempt to bring Cervantes's hero to the big screen began unraveling from the first day of filming. Lead actor Jean Rochefort immediately fell ill, and if that wasn't calamitous enough, a flash flood washed away the entire set in northern Spain. Rochefort eventually ended up in the hospital and since co-star Johnny Depp had other commitments and couldn't wait for Rochefort to recover, Gilliam was forced to abandon the film. The whole shoot is chronicled in 2002 documentary ""Lost in La Mancha."" The ambitious director recently told movie magazine, Empire, that the project is up and running again and that shooting will begin next spring. No word yet though on who will play the man of La Mancha. 7. 'The Crow' (Alex Proyas, 1994)  This ill-fated production took a tragic turn after lead Brandon Lee died on set in 1993. He was shot by a misloaded prop gun. The untimely death of Brandon Lee, the son of martial arts legend Bruce Lee who suffered a bizarre death of his own in 1973 (father and son are buried side-by-side in Seattle), added an eerie dimension to the already dark film about a man who comes back from the dead. 8. 'Aguirre: The Wrath of God' (Werner Herzog, 1972)  It's no surprise that controversial director Herzog makes this list twice. While filming ""Aguirre,"" he threatened to shoot Klaus Kinski when the actor tried to bail on the film. Herzog has said that as Kinski was packing this things into a speed boat to make his escape, he told him very quietly that he ""would have eight bullets through his head before he reached the next bend of the river."" While Herzog denies wielding a gun at the time he made the threat, he has said he did have a gun on set. 9. 'Dancer in the Dark' (Lars von Trier, 2000)  Lars von Trier has a reputation for being hard on his actors and for Icelandic singer Bjork's acting debut, he certainly didn't pull any punches. It's rumored that Bjork became so unhinged during the shoot that she ate her own cardigan. Von Trier has claimed that every morning Bjork would say, ""Mr. von Trier, I despise you,"" and spit at him. The experience was so traumatic for Bjork that afterwards she insisted she'd never act again. 10. 'Three Kings' (David O. Russell, 1999)  Director David O. Russell and actor George Clooney are reported to have physically confronted each other on the set of this Iraq war drama over the filmmaker's treatment of an extra. Five years later, Russell famously blew up at veteran actress Lily Tomlin after she berated him while filming ""I Heart Huckabees"" in 2004 -- an episode that became a hit on YouTube. ""I felt bad for Lily,"" Clooney said about the ""Huckabees"" incident to EW.com in 2007. ""But I also felt a little vindicated for anyone that thought that that had anything to do with me on [""Three Kings""]. Russell, for his part, says he is not the biggest fan of movie stars. ""Clooney went a long way towards that,"" he told UK broadsheet The Daily Telegraph in 2004.","These shoots endured a string of disastrous setbacks before calling it a wrap .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The estranged wife of actor Stephen Collins said Wednesday she isn't trying to extort any money from her husband as they go through a contentious divorce and the former ""7th Heaven"" star is the subject of child molestation allegations. The allegations surfaced Tuesday after celebrity news site TMZ posted an audio recording that purports to have been made during a November 2012 therapy session involving Collins and his wife, Faye Grant. The accusations against the actor best known for playing a pastor on ""7th Heaven,"" which ran for 11 years, are explosive. In the recording, the website says, Collins made incriminating statements. They are similar to those Grant accuses him of in divorce filings, namely that he admitted to her that he molested three underage girls. Neither Collins' attorney nor his agent have returned any of CNN's numerous calls. But in a court filing in the couple's divorce, Grant claimed Collins, now 67, had ""been engaging in a long-term pattern of sexually molesting children."" Collins' lawyer fired back, saying in his client's legal response that her claims were ""really an attempt to extort concessions in settlement."" On Wednesday, Grant released a statement denying she wants more than half of the marital assets. ""This is a deeply sad situation for everyone involved. With regard to the divorce proceedings, I am seeking no more than that to which I am legally entitled under the laws of the State of California,"" she said. TMZ also reported Wednesday that ""Collins' people"" said Grant was using the recording from the therapy session as a means to getting a larger settlement. Her divorce lawyer, Larry Ginsberg, said the accusation is untrue. ""Faye never asked for more than the 'guideline' amount of spousal support based on Mr. Collins' income. From the very beginning of the dissolution of marriage matter, Faye has worked diligently to get this matter settled and to put it behind her while coping with the distress and trauma suffered as a result of the revelations about Mr. Collins' life."" Grant said in the court documents that she was unaware of Collins' behavior until he told her in January 2012. They separated the next month, after almost 27 years of marriage. A can of worms . Tuesday's revelation opened up a whole can of worms for the actor. The gist of it is this: A relative of Collins' first wife went to police in November 2012 and told them she was sexually assaulted by Collins when she was 14 years old while inside his New York apartment, a senior law enforcement official told CNN on Tuesday evening. Due to the statute of limitations, he can't face charges in the case. There are specific laws in child sexual abuse cases in New York that do allow for an extension of the statute of limitations in certain cases, but this particular allegation against Collins can't be prosecuted, the official added. Now, the investigation continues to see if there might be any other women with similar allegations, the source said. In New York, a person has five years from their 18th birthday to make an accusation of sexual abuse to authorities. Los Angeles police said they received information two years ago regarding allegations of criminal behavior. The case is no longer active, LAPD spokesman Andrew Neiman said. ""No crime report was ever made and there was no verified victim,"" he said. Bizarre end to Tuesday . Collins is alive and well, the Los Angeles police said late Tuesday night after rumors circulated on social media that he had shot himself. But he wasn't even at home when a reporter camped outside heard a loud noise and called police, believing it was a gunshot, said Los Angeles Police spokeswoman Jane Kim. Police determined no shots had been fired. But the news already had ricocheted around the world, helped in part by numerous tweets, including one by actress Donna D'Errico to her 53,000 followers. ""That guy from 7th Heaven lives right around the corner from me & just shot himself a few minutes ago,"" she wrote. That tweet has since been deleted. ""I just tweeted out what I was being told by my neighbor(s) who were on scene. I apologize for tweeting what I'd heard before confirming it,"" she posted instead. Source: '7th Heaven' actor's accuser waited too long . The fallout . Following the revelation of the allegations, Collins was fired from his job on the movie ""Ted 2."" A future episode of the ABC show ""Scandal"" won't include any footage with Collins, representatives for the show said Wednesday. Collins appeared as anchorman Reed Wallace in a 2012 episode of the hit drama and was set to appear in another one this season. Collins also resigned Tuesday from his spot on the national board of the Screen Actors Guild, a source at the organization with knowledge of the situation told CNN.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The space shuttle Endeavour's journey of 123 million miles ended Sunday afternoon when it rolled into its final resting place at the California Science Center in Los Angeles, where it will go on public display later this month. It took more than two days for the shuttle to inch its way across the 12 miles from the Los Angeles International Airport to the science center, navigating around trees and light poles along the narrow path. Dozens of trees were cut down and traffic signs removed to make room for the Endeavour, but in other cases the shuttle's self-propelled mobile transporter, capable of turning the shuttle 360 degrees, helped the big white bird to zigzag its way around the obstacles. Now, after 25 space missions in its 22-year career, Endeavour will be parked in a display pavilion built just for the shuttle. ""Mission 26: Mission accomplished!"" said Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. Endeavour draws festival of admirers as it inches home . He praised the more than 1,000 police officers and more than 200 firefighters who helped the shuttle maneuver through the city, and the hundreds of thousands who came out for the spectacle. Science center President Jeff Rudolph said everyone along the route was positive and encouraging. ""Mr. Mayor, I may get kicked for it, but it was the mother of all parades,"" he joked, but Villaraigosa agreed. The shuttle's trek to the science center was initially expected to end Saturday night, but obstacles and a mechanical issue slowed it down, said Los Angeles Police Sgt. Rudy Lopez. As Endeavour neared the science center it had to travel down Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, lined with Canary Island pine trees dedicated to the late civil rights leader that officials did not want to cut down. As if to remind the world it was designed for precision, the shuttle moved so carefully past the trees that at certain points, the distance between the orbiter's wing and the tree was the width of a credit card, said Shell Amega, spokeswoman for the California Science Center Foundation. Specialists were part of the convoy to make sure the Endeavour and its transporter platform, which together weigh more than 80 tons, didn't stress underground water and sewer systems. Crews laid 2,700 steel plates on parts of the route. Los Angeles Fire Chief Brian Cummings said the shuttle's ""seamless"" procession allowed everyone to feel like an astronaut. Stunning shots of Endeavour's final journey . Gwendolyn Crews, owner of a preschool, told CNN she was bringing her entire preschool to watch the Endeavour's arrival at the museum. ""I think this is a history-making moment here in Los Angeles, California, and I want to be able to share this with my kids, my grandkids, my great-grandkids ... and the children of our school,"" Crews said. Villaraigosa called the shuttle's trip through the city a once-in-a-lifetime event. Latasha Covington and her children, 9-year-old Skilyn and 4-year-old Amarie, brought a chair out Saturday to stand on to get a better view. ""I've been here 32 years in L.A. and I've never seen anything like this, so it's part of history. I wanted them to see that,"" Covington said. The respect was a fitting tribute to the shuttle, which was delivered to Kennedy Space Center in May 1991. Endeavour's final journey, are you there? NASA ended the shuttle program in July 2011. Endeavour's fellow shuttles Discovery, Enterprise and Atlantis are also now museum pieces. Named for the first ship commanded by British explorer James Cook, Endeavour cost $1.7 billion when it rolled out as a replacement for Challenger, which exploded shortly after its 10th launch. Over the next 20 years, Endeavour completed some of the highest-profile shuttle missions. It flew a Spacelab mission and numerous International Space Station assembly missions and rendezvoused with Russia's Mir Space Station. The science museum has been trumpeting the arrival of the shuttle. The museum's foundation raised more than $10 million to fund the transportation of the shuttle to the center, Amega said, and is halfway toward its goal of raising $200 million to support the exhibit that opens October 30. The museum will display the shuttle horizontally in the pavilion while it builds a new addition to its facility, the Air and Space Center. When that center opens in five years, the shuttle will be on display in its vertical launch position. Read more space and science news on CNN's Light Years blog . A short history of Endeavour .

"ARLINGTON, Virginia (CNN) -- It was a journey that took more than a hundred years. Cpl. Isaiah Mays was awarded the Medal of Honor after being wounded in an ambush in 1889. Missing for decades, the remains of Cpl. Isaiah Mays, a Buffalo Soldier and Medal of Honor recipient, were laid to rest Friday at Arlington National Cemetery. Paying respects were African-American veterans, U.S. Army soldiers and those who rode for days as part of a motorcycle escort -- members of the Missing in America Project, who traveled from as far away as California and Arizona at their own expense to make sure Mays got a proper burial. None was a relative but they consider themselves his brothers. They stood shoulder to shoulder in an older section of the cemetery, surrounded by the graves of veterans from wars long ago. Some came in Army dress blue uniforms. Others wore uniforms like those worn by the Buffalo Soldiers, who served in the legendary all-black Army units formed after the Civil War. The crowd stood witness as a color guard folded the American flag and saluted when three rifle volleys pierced the air. A bugler, surrounded by the graves of other fallen heroes, played taps. William McCurtis, the regimental sergeant major of a Buffalo Soldier group, perhaps voiced the sentiment of everyone who came: ""One more out of 6,000 has his day of recognition. We need to get the rest recognized."" Mays was born a slave in Virginia in 1858 but spent most of his life west of the Mississippi, joining the famed Buffalo Soldiers as the black cavalry and infantry troops fought in the frontier Indian Wars. In 1889, he was part of a small detachment assigned to protect a U.S. Army pay wagon, which was caught in an ambush by a band of bandits. A gunfight ensued and almost all the soldiers were wounded or killed. Mays was shot in both legs. The bandits made off with $29,000 in gold coins. Despite his wounds, Mays managed to walk and crawl two miles to a ranch to seek help. He was awarded a Medal of Honor on February 15, 1890. More than 20 Buffalo Soldiers have received the Medal of Honor, the military's highest award for valor. Mays left the Army in 1893 and many years later applied for a federal pension. But he was denied. He was committed to an Arizona state hospital that cared for the mentally ill, tuberculosis patients and the indigent. When he died in 1925, Mays was buried in the hospital cemetery in a grave marked only with a number. Years later, a small group of hospital staff and veterans located his grave and arranged for a formal ceremony on Memorial Day 2001. They were determined that Mays should not be forgotten. A few weeks ago, after receiving court permission, volunteers dug up Mays' remains and transported them from Arizona to Washington so he could be buried with honor at Arlington. After the ceremony, those who gathered to honor Mays posed for photographs and, like good soldiers, they congratulated each other for a hard-won battle. Cpl. Isaiah Mays was finally home.","Cpl.

"(CNN) -- One of the questions I've been asked the most in the 10 days since judge Hans-Joachim Eckert's summary was published of Michael Garcia's report into the conduct of the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bids, is the extent to which I'm upset with the comments about me as the ""Australian whistleblower."" The answer is: not that much -- and there are two reasons. First, the report is an investigation into FIFA of the world governing body's decisions and processes, conducted by Garcia who is paid by FIFA. The conclusions reached are that there's really nothing to worry about when it comes to FIFA. Surprise. Do you see the pattern here? Second, while it wasn't nice to read what was written about me and it wasn't what I expected, it is also untrue. I didn't expect to read about any of the 75 individuals with whom Garcia met, let alone to see Phaedra Al-Majid and me singled out in such negative terms. Not only were the two of us referred to as ""whistle-blowers"" in the pejorative, but I was referred to as ""unreliable"" and Phaedra -- who worked on the successful Qatar bid -- was referred to as both ""not credible"" and ""unreliable."" It was an extraordinary and unprofessional attack by one or both of the two men who preside over FIFA's Ethics Committee. While Eckert or Garcia must have their reasons for so openly flouting standards of whistle-blower conventions, the important point is they also accepted the issues that I raised with them. The issues that are subsequently presented in the summary report related to Australia -- and which Eckert refers to as ""potentially problematic conduct"" -- are amongst the matters I discussed with Garcia. For me, this is the key point as the real issue is FIFA. In any case, as Garcia himself has claimed, it is also easy to find errors in the summary report. For example, in the section related to the former FIFA Executive Committee member, Mohamed Bin Hammam, it is noted that Oceania Football Confederation's (OFC) intention to support Australia's bid ""was publicly reported as early as October 17, 2010."" Wrong. It was announced by the President of Australia's football association at a media conference, alongside President Sepp Blatter, in Brisbane on June 1, 2008. This is a matter of public record. It is curious that either Garcia or Eckert got this date wrong by 28 months because it goes to the heart of issues raised earlier in the summary report, and it is also relevant to what appears to be an illogical conclusion regarding the impact of Reynald Temarii's eventual absence from taking part in the final vote. But while the focus of the past four years has been the decisions of the Executive Committee regarding 2018/2022, FIFA has been the subject of corruption allegations for decades. Concerned about his legacy after the 2018/2022 decisions, Blatter embarked upon successive so-called governance reforms in 2011 that left most people shaking their heads in disbelief. First, he announced the establishment of a ""Council of Wisdom"" comprising Henry Kissinger, Placido Domingo and Johan Cruyff. When it finally dawned on Blatter that this wasn't his brightest idea, he invited Transparency International and an independent Swiss governance expert, Professor Mark Pieth to advise him. Transparency International later quit, raising questions over FIFA's commitment to reform because Pieth was being paid by the world governing body. Professor Pieth hung in there for more than two years but could not chip-away at the cultural change required in the organization. A high-profile anti-bribery expert who was a member of one of the new committees, Alexandra Wrage, quit in 2013 telling the Guardian: ""We all focus our efforts where we can have an impact and I was not having an impact at FIFA. ""It is important the organization you are dealing with is receptive to those efforts and receptive to change. ""The independent governance committee put in a tremendous amount of work and effort putting together some fairly uncontroversial recommendations which were then knocked back,"" said Wrage, who is president of the non-profit international anti-bribery group Trace. FIFA has grown to become an international commercial behemoth -- albeit an unaccountable one -- in Blatter's time and he has built the World Cup into one of the most prestigious sporting event on the planet. But it has been at the expense of the reputation of world football and without regard for the two key stakeholders of the game -- players and fans. FIFA is incapable of reforming itself -- and it is time for those of us who love the game and who play the game to ask sponsors, broadcasters and governments to intervene to give us a new world governing body now. What football should have is an international governing body that has the same level of transparency and accountability that we expect of our governments, major institutions and international organizations. An international governing body that is responsible to the many millions of people who play the game and the billions who are fans; and one that meets standards befitting an organization that will make a profit of $2 billion from the 2014 World Cup, according to Forbes. Governments, sponsors and broadcasters should demand an interim time limited administration, led by an eminent person with a broad mandate to develop a new constitution, governance arrangements and policies and to conduct new elections -- in other words, an International Olympic Committee-like reform. Together with Al-Majid I've been invited by British MP Damian Collins to help arrange a FIFA reform conference in Brussels in January, which I hope will produce the reforms that the IOC put into place. Finally, another question I have been asked is whether I would do this again. Being a whistle-blower means your life changes. In my case, I raised my concerns internally but my employment was terminated. It takes a toll financially and emotionally. In a relatively small country like Australia, you lose your livelihood; and, at my stage in life, the financial security you were building for your family. But we all need to consider how we want our lives measured. We all make choices. In the case of FIFA, you can play in the sandpit; you can leave your principles at the door; or you can be prepared to be resilient and take the consequences from those who desperately want to maintain the sinecures of the status quo.","FIFA under fire from whistle-blower .

"(CNN)  -- Dear Young American Women, . It's possible that you have been told a time or 10 that you don't appreciate how tough your elders had it. It's true that, if you had been coming of age back in, say, 1960, you would probably be feeling more restricted, if only because you were doomed to spend your days in a skirt, nylon stockings and girdle. (Everybody wore a girdle back then, even Barbie, the individual least in need of a foundation garment in American history.) Back then, if you wanted a career that involved travel, you'd have to have become a flight attendant. Although good luck with that -- there were 100 applicants for every opening. People paid to go to special schools to learn how to improve their chances of being chosen for that very job that involved appallingly low pay and allowed you to be fired if you gained weight or got married. Fifty years ago, women couldn't get a credit card or apartment lease unless their father or husband co-signed. And it was perfectly legal for an employer to say that he didn't hire women. (Madeleine Kunin, the future governor of Vermont, applied for an editing job at my own beloved New York Times and was asked if she'd like to consider waitressing in the corporate dining room.) You may be thinking right now that this actually doesn't sound so bad, that it would be more fun to take to the streets protesting job discrimination than worrying about living in the streets because there aren't any jobs around at all. Point well taken. You've got your own problems and truly, you are not required to bow down to the generation that gave you equal opportunity to play high school sports. (Now even Sarah Palin loves Title 9. But when it first became law, men were sure it would mean the end of football and everything they held dear. Rep. Pat Schroeder of Colorado was touring a local high school shortly after it passed, and the boys' basketball coach said ""Show the congresswoman what you think of Title 9."" The team turned around and mooned her.) There are plenty of challenges that still remain and you know about them better than me. If you're planning on knocking them dead in business or one of the professions, you may discover, to your shock, that there's still discrimination out there. If you're thinking about a military career, there's never been a better time for a woman, but the problem of sexual harassment in the field is disturbingly real. No matter what you're doing, you're probably going to wind up worrying about how to balance work and family. Violence against women hasn't gone away; it actually seems to be getting worse. And if you're prepared to worry about things on an international sphere, the oppression of women in other parts of the world is a cancer that has to be cured if the planet is going to evolve in the right direction. What with all that, it looks like there's plenty on your plate. And if you don't feel like dwelling on the non-problems, if you automatically assume that a woman has as much right to have a terrific career and exciting adventures as any guy, that's great. For the entire history of recorded civilization, people had ideas about women's limitations, and their proper (domestic) place in the world. That all changed in my lifetime -- came crumbling down. The fact that I got to see it, in the tiny sliver of history I inhabit, just knocks me out. You taking it for granted knocks me out. But if you do want to take a look back now and then, and contemplate how America evolved into a country where women could finally claim their rights, you might enjoy the ride even more. It's a great story, and it was all leading up to you.","Journalist Gail Collins remembers big changes and current problems for women .

"United Nations (CNN) -- The Palestinian bid for statehood at the United Nations was effectively stalled Friday after the Security Council approved a report stating its inability ""to make a unanimous recommendation."" ""We knew from the beginning ... that we might not be able to succeed in the Security Council because there is a powerful country that has the veto power,"" said Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian envoy to the United Nations. He said that he believed the report was ""objective."" The United States has been vocal about its intention to veto any Palestinian bid for statehood. Last week, France and the United Kingdom said they would abstain from the vote. Those three nations, along with China and Russia, have veto power in the Security Council. ""We thought that with diligent diplomatic efforts, with success at the UNESCO, of being admitted in the U.N. system as the state of Palestine ... that Palestine would be admitted as a member state,"" Mansour said. UNESCO is the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, which recently granted the Palestinian Authority full membership . The report, written by a special Security Council committee and obtained by CNN, was the result of seven weeks of meetings. It details myriad disagreements between the council members on whether Palestine fulfills the requirements set forth in the U.N. charter for members countries. By contrast, when the committee met to discuss the application of South Sudan -- a territory and now country involved in no small dispute of its own -- it came to an agreement after a single 10-minute meeting. According to the charter, countries seeking membership must be ""peace-loving,"" ""accept the obligations"" of the U.N. charter, and ""willing and able to carry out"" those obligations. According to the report, the 15 council members fall into three categories: those countries that support Palestinian membership, those that can't support it at this time (for whom abstention was envisaged in the event of a vote), and those countries that say the requirements were not met and couldn't vote for recommendation. In order for a vote to take place, one of the 15 council members must request it. Diplomats say, however, that the ball is largely in the Palestinians' court to push for a vote. Were a council resolution to pass, the membership bid would be forwarded to the General Assembly, where passage is all but assured. A vote in the near term does not seem likely. But should it take place, diplomats say that the Palestinians are unlikely to get even the nine votes necessary for a resolution to pass, because of a large number of abstentions. The U.S. veto would effectively be moot. ""The Palestinians have to make their own choice as to how to proceed,"" said Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. ""The United States has made its own views quite clear, both directly to the Palestinians and to the larger international community and the council membership. We'll look to see what they choose to do."" The next step for the Palestinians remains unclear. They could sidestep the Security Council and go straight to the General Assembly, where they would get an upgraded observer status, matching that of the Vatican, but not full membership. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, however, has said that they will not pursue that option. Abbas is set to meet with the leadership of the Arab League next week. U.N. diplomats say that the Palestinians' next step may become more clear after that meeting.","A report details myriad disagreements between the council members .

"(CNN) -- Gay men who've abstained from sex for one year would be able to donate blood in 2015, ending a lifetime ban for the gay community, under a proposed FDA policy change unveiled Tuesday. The current lifetime ban by U.S. Food and Drug Administration states dates back to 1983 and forbids men who have had sex with men from becoming blood donors because the group is ""at increased risk for HIV, hepatitis B and certain other infections that can be transmitted by transfusion,"" the FDA has ruled. But the FDA is now seeking a change in that policy and would allow such blood donations based on an independent expert advisory panel's recommendation, the agency said. The proposed change would align the one-year deferral period ""with that of other men and women at increased risk for HIV infection,"" the FDA said. The agency will be gathering public comments on the proposed change. ""We encourage all stakeholders to take this opportunity to provide any information the agency should consider, and look forward to receiving and reviewing these comments,"" FDA Commissioner Margaret A. Hamburg said in a statement. The National Heart Lung and Blood Institute and the FDA would monitor a national blood surveillance system to see any effects of the proposed policy change and to ensure the continued safety of the blood supply, Hamburg said. ""A history of male-to-male sex is associated with an increased risk for exposure to and transmission of certain infectious diseases, including HIV, the virus that causes AIDS,"" the FDA said. Men who have had sex with other men represent approximately 2% of the U.S. population, yet are the population most severely affected by HIV, according to the FDA. In 2010, male-to-male sex accounted for at least 61% of all new HIV infections in the United States, and ""an estimated 77% of diagnosed HIV infections among males were attributed to male-to-male sexual contact,"" the FDA said.","Gay men who abstain from sex for one year may be able to give blood in 2015 .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- On the outskirts of Tokyo, behind a small government building, underneath a soccer field and skateboard park, sits a remarkable feat of engineering. It's an example of how Japan's capital, which lies in a region at high risk from flooding and tropical cyclones, is trying to figure out how to contain the elements to protect its 13 million inhabitants. The entrance, which is locked at all times, is so nondescript a visitor may walk past dozens of times without ever noticing it. But today, we are given a tour down below of the so-called ""Water Discharge Tunnel."" Built between 1993 and 2006 at a cost of nearly $3 billion, the stunning complex is far more impressive than its name suggests. Winding down a series of stairs, you soon come upon a massive hall, resembling an underground Parthenon, or a scene out of a science fiction film. In pictures: Sandy's trail of destruction . The initial water tank stretches more than 320 feet in length and towers higher than a five-story building. When you add it all up, the complex features five massive shafts, or tanks, that are able to move water along a tunnel that stretches nearly four miles. Special: Tokyo battles the elements . In this area of Saitama prefecture, heavy rains would often flood the Naka River Basin. But now, that valuable farmland has an incredible drain system sitting below. When the tanks and tunnel fill, engineers are able to turn on the heart of the system, which is a series of four turbines powered by jet engines similar to those used in a Boeing 737 airplane. The turbines are then able to rapidly funnel floodwaters to the nearby Edo River. It's worth noting that this part of suburban Tokyo can hardly be compared to the dense underground of New York City, which is a maze of subway tunnels, sewage systems and power lines. The engineers here are the first to point out that their system, while remarkable, is meant to deal with heavy rains -- and that it would struggle to cope with a Sandy-type storm surge coming from the Atlantic Ocean into New York's Upper Bay. Still, the underground marvel could inspire engineers to look for new ways to try to contain Mother Nature in the future. Huge plugs could have spared subways from flooding, developers say .","Japan's ""Water Discharge Tunnel"" complex drains floodwater into Edo River .

"(CNN) -- With ""Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,"" it's John Boyega's time to shine. Yes, the cast for the upcoming ""Episode VII"" is huge and packed with big-name stars, including franchise veterans Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher. But in the new teaser for ""The Force Awakens,"" which nearly broke the Internet when it was released Friday, it's Boyega who's featured. In the first 25 seconds, a chilling voice announces that ""there's been awakening."" And then, in a great bit of editing, we see Boyega pop up on screen, startled, sweaty and in a Stormtrooper suit. What does that mean? Only time and/or director J.J. Abrams will tell. We still don't know exactly who Boyega is playing in ""The Force Awakens,"" but clearly he's integral to the story if he's opening the biggest trailer of the year. As we countdown to Boyega's appearance alongside Daisy Ridley, Oscar Isaac and more in ""The Force Awakens,"" here's what you should know about the actor: . 1. He hails from London. Boyega, 22, is making his fellow Londoners proud. The young actor was born to Nigerian parents in Peckham, London, and studied performing arts at South Thames College. From there, he trained at The Identity School of Acting and took to the stage at London venues like the National Theatre and the Tricycle Theatre. 2. You know him best from ""Attack the Block."" For those who've seen 2011's sleeper hit ""Attack the Block,"" Boyega is a huge selling point for ""The Force Awakens."" The premise for ""Attack"" is kind of crazytown, as it follows a group of streetwise kids who battle aliens that descend upon South London. But Boyega completely owns the role of Moses in the film, turning ""Attack"" into a must-see. Even more impressive, ""Attack"" was Boyega's first feature film role. As Vanity Fair has explained, if ""it's a lightsaber-swinging Jedi we want, then Boyega is simply the man for the job. For his credentials, you need only look at his most prominent film to-date, the cult sci-fi hit, 'Attack The Block.' "" 3. His first role was as a leopard in a school play. Boyega has harbored aspirations to act since he was very young and recalled to Interview magazine in 2011 that it was an elementary school play that turned him on to the art form. ""I went on all fours, and I was playing this leopard, and I gave him character breakdown, and I was doing the work and doing the research and creating a character,"" he said. ""That is the greatest feeling ever. When you're young and you're like, 'Oh, this is quite cool, and I really, really want to do this.' "" 4. He's a Marvel fan. Boyega revealed he's a Marvel fanboy this year, right before Comic-Con 2014. With rumors running hot that the studio was about to unveil a Black Panther movie at the annual comics-centric event, Boyega stoked the flames with tweets that he was ""aiming"" for the role. ""Marvel role? ... damn right aiming for it,"" Boyega tweeted in July. ""Currently booking flight to Wakanda."" Marvel's Black Panther was one of the first black superheroes in mainstream comic books, and Wakanda was his home. Although the role wound up going to Chadwick Boseman, that wasn't for Boyega's lack of effort. 5. He's a must-follow on Instagram. You'll notice that it's now much harder to find Boyega on Twitter -- and there are some theories as to why -- but his Instagram feed is not only a glimpse behind-the-scenes of ""The Force Awakens"" but also into the actor's personal life. One of our favorite snapshots is with his co-star Daisy Ridley: . .","John Boyega is the first person seen in new ""Star Wars"" trailer .

"(CNN) -- Goofing around in the office has been taken to a whole new level by a couple of guys who work for Squarespace, a website creation company in New York City. Chris Limbrick and Francesco Fragomeni started making what they call ""painting remixes"" in early November. The side-by-side mashups of everything from Michelangelo's ""The Creation of Adam"" to Frida Kahlo's 1943 self-portrait ""Thinking About Death"" have gathered thousands of followers on their website, Tumblr and Instagram pages. The project they've dubbed ""FoolsDoArt"" began on a whim, and got an unlikely assist from Limbrick's mother. ""We were sitting around with some friends at work and we randomly ended up reenacting a scene from the Sistine Chapel,"" the pair wrote in an email to CNN. ""One of our coworkers pulled out her phone and took a picture which we thought was funny but we didn't initially think anything of it. Chris texted the photo to his mom, who then stitched our shot together with a photograph from the actual Sistine Chapel and texted it back to Chris."" Thus began a quest to recreate some of the most iconic works of art in the world in their downtime at work. The rules: They can use only props that are available in the office and any photo editing must be done on their smartphones using apps like Snapseed, Diptic, and Square InstaPic. ""We really enjoy the DIY look of the photos so we also made a rule against using Photoshop,"" the pair said. Both men are art lovers and avid photographers outside of work too. Fragomeni was printmaker specializing in antiquarian photo-chemical printmaking processes before moving over to the tech field. So they've got some background in creating beautiful things. They've also got access to much cooler office supplies than your average cubicle dweller.

"(CNN) -- One man's trash is another man's treasure. Admittedly, it helps if the trash comes from one of the most famous billionaire businessmen on the planet. When Richard Branson zipped across the Atlantic in the record-breaking time of three days, eight hours and 31 minutes, in 1986, his magnificent powerboat was held up as the cutting edge of design. But almost 30 years later, the $2.3 million Atlantic Virgin Challenger II which captured our imaginations, had been left to rot in a remote Spanish boatyard. Until now. A British boat builder -- who as a teenager watched Branson thump across the waves in style -- has rescued the iconic powerboat from the scrapyard in an ambitious plan to restore her to former glory. ""She looked so sorry for herself, tucked away in this boatyard, surrounded by numerous other boats rotting away in a type of nautical graveyard,"" said boat builder and new owner, Dan Stevens. ""It was such an amazing boat and an amazing achievement -- a piece of maritime history. We want to restore her and bring her back to the UK where she belongs."" Branson himself has backed the ambitious project, tweeting: ""So many memories on Virgin Atlantic Challenger II, would be great to see it back on the ocean."" Indeed, footage of a young Branson speeding from New York to Britain's Isle of Scilly in a sleek 22-meter powerboat, epitomized the technological spirit of the era. After all, this was 1986: IBM had just unveiled its first laptop, the Soviet Union was launching the Mir Space Station and Tom Cruise kept daring us to fly ever higher in the hit film ""Top Gun"". Yet peer inside Challenger II today, and you'll find a sagging, faded 1980s time warp. ""It's like stepping back in time,"" Stevens said of the boat which had notched up just 800 hours on the clock. ""It still has all the Virgin livery, original charts, electronics and seats."" ""It's amazing just looking out the window -- a bit like sitting in the front seat in Knight Rider,"" he added, referring to the 1982 TV series starring David Hasselhoff and a sci-fi car. After smashing the record books, Virgin Atlantic Challenger II is believed to have been sold to a Saudi Arabian sultan, whose faded coat of arms still adorns the boat. In 2005 it was sold again to a secret owner who ""kept it in the Mediterranean but rarely used it,"" said Stevens. ""The boat was towed into Palma where she started to degrade quite quickly."" Work is now underway repairing the vessel which had been left languishing in a boatyard for the last eight years, with plans to test her on the open seas next month. Challenger II will have a new engine, fuel tank, electronic equipment and interior -- all in keeping with the original style. Once complete, the legendary vessel will travel 2,400 kilometers to Stevens' boat building business, Seahawks Workboats in south west England, with plans to tour her across the country. The vessel had been advertised for $380,000, though Stevens declined to say how much he paid for it. ""She could have very easily been set for the scrapyard,"" he said. ""Many people had seen her, but I think a lot had been scared off by the amount of work needed."" Challenger II may have cemented her place in maritime history, but it wasn't all smooth sailing for the record-breaking Atlantic crossing. Branson's first attempt at the Blue Riband Transatlantic Challenge -- the award for the fastest crossing of the ocean -- ended in disaster in 1985 when Virgin Atlantic Challenger I sunk off the south west coast of England. Unfortunately for Branson, he was denied the Blue Riband after breaking two rules of the competition - stopping to refuel and using a vessel which did not have a commercial maritime purpose. Regardless, he was showered in champagne greeted by cheering crowds upon arrival in Britain -- despite the pouring rain. Today, Challenger II may be a little worse for wear. But much like that other 1980s icon, film Back to the Future, Stevens may soon turn back the clock on the legendary power boat.","Richard Branson's record-breaking speedboat discovered in Spanish boatyard .

"(CNN) -- Several prominent civil rights groups filed a class action lawsuit Friday challenging Alabama's new anti-illegal immigration law, the latest such legal effort aimed at similar bills passed in various states. The suit claims the recently passed HB 56 ""endangers public safety, invites the racial profiling of Latinos, Asians and others who appear foreign to an officer, and interferes with federal law,"" according to a press release Friday sent by the Southern Poverty Law Center. That group allied with several other groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, National  Immigration Law Center, Asian Law Caucus and  Hispanic Interest  Coalition of Alabama. Their lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for Northern Alabama. Mary Bauer, the Southern Poverty Law Center's legal director, told CNN that she believed the law is ""radical"" -- even more so than similar bills enacted in Arizona and Georgia, for instance -- and sent a clear, unwelcoming message to immigrants. ""We hope the law never  goes into effect,"" said Bauer. The Alabama legislation, known as HB 56, was passed and signed by Gov.  Robert Bentley last month and is set to take effect on September 1. Bentley's spokeswoman, Rebekah Mason, issued a statement Friday standing behind the bill. ""Gov. Bentley campaigned on the need for a strong immigration bill,"" said Mason. ""The legislature passed that bill, and the governor signed it."" Suzanne Webb, a spokeswoman for Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange, said by e-mail Friday afternoon that her office had yet to get a copy of the complaint, and thus had no comment on the specifics. Regardless, she said the attorney general planned to defend the controversial measure. ""Under state law, acts of our legislature are presumed to be constitutional, and it is the duty of this office to defend them, and we will do so,"" said Webb. While immigration had long been a federal responsibility, other anti-illegal immigration measures have been passed in recent months in Arizona, Utah, Georgia, Indiana and South Carolina. Parts of those laws have been suspended in four of those states, pending resolutions to the lawsuits. Last month, a federal judge struck down a key part of the Georgia law in deciding police cannot inquire about immigration status when questioning suspects in certain criminal investigations. Alabama's law has a similar provision. According to a fact sheet presented by Alabama House Republicans, the   bill requires law enforcement officers ""to attempt to determine the   immigration status of a person who they suspect is an unauthorized   alien of this country."" The legislation also makes it a criminal  offense to transport or house to an illegal immigrant. The  state will have to check the citizenship of students, and any business  that knowingly employs an illegal immigrant will be penalized. Republican state Rep. John Merrill told CNN in June that the legislation is ""good for Alabama"" because it will  reduce illegal immigration to the state and ""provide equal opportunities for all people who want to come to Alabama legally."" He rejected suggestions  the law is discriminatory, saying he is confident it was drafted in  such a way that it will survive legal challenges. But several civil rights advocates called the Alabama bill unconstitutional and unfair, vowing in the SPLC's press release to fight it in court on a number of grounds. Sin Yen Ling, an attorney with the Asian Law Caucus, called it the ""harshest version"" of the laws that have followed Arizona's pioneering measure. Among other aspects, the measure will ""turn teachers, landlords and community members into de facto immigration enforcement agents,"" claimed Linton Joaquin of the National Immigration Law Center. Olivia Turner, the executive director of the ACLU in Alabama, said the bill marks a big step backward for the state, which had been central in the civil rights movement. ""In the nearly 50 years since the historical and worldwide movement for civil and human rights began in our state, real progress has been made,"" said Turner. ""But this law threatens to pull us back to a dark and shameful past -- and one in which all Alabamians were held back."" CNN's Gustavo Valdes contributed to this report.","NEW: A spokeswoman for Alabama's governor stands behind the legislation .

"TRIPOLI, Libya (CNN) -- Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice met Friday with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, who asked for the latest news on the hurricanes plaguing U.S. coasts in recent weeks. Condoleezza Rice and Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi discussed the weather Friday at their initial meeting. ""The first one was not as bad as feared, but there are two more coming,"" Rice told the man dubbed by President Reagan ""the mad dog in the Middle East."" Rice's visit is the first time in more than half a century that a U.S. secretary of state has visited the former pariah nation. Upon her arrival, Rice met with the Libyan foreign minister and then toured the new U.S. Embassy. ""We are working on a trade and investment agreement, a framework, which will allow the improvement of the climate for investment, which I know very many American firms wish to do,"" Rice said after her meeting with Minister Abdel-Rahman Shalgam. She called the meeting a ""good start"" toward establishing a ""positive relationship"" with Libya. Rice and Gadhafi met in a reception room at the Libyan's Bab el-Azizia compound. Gadhafi, wearing a white robe and a black fez but not his trademark dark sunglasses, shook the hands of the male members of Rice's staff but not Rice, instead offering the traditional greeting of his hand over his heart for her.  Watch excitement in Libya at Rice's trip » . Muslim men are prohibited from shaking hands with women to whom they are not related. After their meeting, Rice joined Gadhafi, who once called Rice ""Leeza ... my darling black African woman,"" in a traditional Muslim evening meal breaking the fast during the holy month of Ramadan. Last year in an interview with Al-Jazeera, Gadhafi suggested Rice ran the Arab world with which he has sometimes had stark differences. ""I admire and am very proud of the way she leans back and gives orders to the Arab leaders,"" he said. ""I love her very much ... because she's a black woman of African origin."" The two are expected to meet in the leader's Bedouin tent he favors for high-profile meetings . Rice's visit marks a 180-degree turn in relations between Washington and Tripoli, which for more than three decades have been marked by personal animosity and insults, Libyan terror attacks and U.S. airstrikes. Libya's rehabilitation from being dubbed a ""state sponsor of terrorism"" to a member of the U.N. Security Council represents a rare foreign policy success for the Bush administration in its last months in office. In Lisbon, before flying to Tripoli, Rice called her trip ""a historic moment and it is one that has come after a lot of difficulty, the suffering of many people that will never be forgotten or assuaged, a lot of Americans in particular."" Libya, she acknowledged, ""is a place that is changing and I want to discuss how that change is taking place."" ""I am very much looking forward to it,"" she told reporters . The United States restored relations with Tripoli in 2005, after Gadhafi's decision to abandon his pursuit of weapons of mass destruction, renounce terrorism and compensate victims of the 1986 La Belle disco bombing in Berlin and the 1988 Pan Am 103 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. It also dropped Libya from its State Sponsors of Terrorism list, the only country except for Iraq to have been removed. Since then, several U.S. officials have visited Tripoli and Rice has met several times with her Libyan counterpart. The United States opened its embassy in Tripoli in 2006. The United States has praised Libya's cooperation in fighting terrorism in North Africa, where al Qaeda has been gaining a foothold. U.S. officials also say Gadhafi has prevented Libyan and other foreign fighters from traveling to Iraq to join insurgent movements. At the United Nations, Libya has also voted with the United States to crack down on Iran's nuclear program and has sought to play a helpful role in the crisis in Darfur. Yet relations between the two countries face strains over Libya's poor human rights record and final settlement of claims from the La Belle and Lockerbie bombings. In her meetings with Libyan officials, Rice is expected to raise the issue of political prisoners, especially Fathi al-Jahami, a leading Libyan reformer held in detention since 2002. Last month the United States and Libya reached a deal to resolve outstanding claims for the bombings, but Libya has yet to contribute hundreds of millions of dollars to a fund set up to compensate the bombing victims' families. Many of the Lockerbie victims' families have criticized Rice's decision to meet with Gadhafi, whom they say remains unrepentant for the explosion, which killed 280 people, 180 of them Americans. In a recent interview with the BBC, Gadhafi's son, Saif al-Islam al-Gadhafi, called the Lockerbie families ""very greedy"" and ""trading with the blood of their sons and daughters"" for money. The Bush administration has expressed sympathy with the Lockerbie families but says it is time to move forward with a new relationship with Libya. The deal paves the way for greater access by American companies to Libya's booming economy, in particular its vast oil reserves, the ninth largest in the world. European companies have had much greater access to Libya's energy sector, but Libyan officials say the improved relations with the United States will result in more deals with American oil companies, including exploring vast areas of the country that remain untapped. The country's growing banking, infrastructure and telecommunications sectors also offer enormous opportunities for American investors. Rice will travel throughout North Africa after leaving Tripoli, stopping in Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. But it is the visit to Libya that the State Department recognizes will be the most talked about.","Condoleezza Rice meets with Moammar Gadhafi in Libya .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The Quds Force, the elite unit of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, provides ""lethal support"" to the Sunni-dominated Taliban for use against U.S. and NATO forces, according to information in the new U.S. sanctions imposed on Iran. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, announces the sanctions Thursday. The Quds Force is the ""Iranian regime's primary instrument for providing lethal support to the Taliban,"" and it ""provides weapons and financial support to the Taliban to support anti-U.S. and anti-coalition activity in Afghanistan,"" the Treasury Department alleged Thursday in announcing economic sanctions against the Quds Force and other Iranian military and financial entities. Iran is a predominantly Shiite nation and is known to support Shiite fighters in Iraq, where Shiite and Sunni Muslims have been at odds in recent years, and in Lebanon. In the past, the U.S. military has said the Quds Force also supports the Taliban, the Sunni movement that once controlled Afghanistan and still harbors the al Qaeda terror movement. The Treasury Department statement, however, laid out specific details of that alleged support to justify designating the Quds Force as a supporter of terrorism.  Watch an announcement of the sanctions against Iran » . ""Since at least 2006, Iran has arranged frequent shipments of small arms and associated ammunition, rocket propelled grenades, mortar rounds, 107 mm rockets, plastic explosives, and probably man-portable defense systems to the Taliban,"" the statement said. The Treasury statement also says the Quds Force ""has had a long history"" of backing Hezbollah's ""military, paramilitary, and terrorist activities, providing it with guidance, funding, weapons, intelligence, and logistical support."" The Lebanese Shiite group runs training camps in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley and ""has reportedly trained"" more than 3,000 of the group's fighters at Revolutionary Guard training facilities in Iran, the Treasury Department alleged. The statement further alleges that the Quds Force provides roughly $100 million to $200 million in funding a year to Hezbollah and has helped the group rearm after the war in Lebanon with Israeli forces. The Treasury Department says the Quds Force provides ""material support"" to two Palestinian groups -- Palestinian Islamic Jihad and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. The Quds Force is one of five branches of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. The others are Ground Forces, Air Force, Navy and Basij militia. The Revolutionary Guard Corps ""runs prisons, and has numerous economic interests involving defense production, construction, and the oil industry"" and ""has been outspoken about its willingness to proliferate ballistic missiles capable of carrying"" weapons of mass destruction, the Treasury Department says.

"(CNN) -- Ivory Coast announced Saturday that it's closing its borders in response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Prime Minister Daniel Duncan signed the order that closes the land borders Ivory Coast shares with Guinea and Liberia. The borders will remain closed until further notice in an effort to prevent the Ebola virus from spreading into its territory, according to the government statement. The announcement comes the same day the British government announced one of its citizens was infected with the deadly virus. The Briton, who lives in the West African nation of Sierra Leone, tested positive for the Ebola virus, according to Britain's Department of Health. The man, simply identified as ""William,"" was living in a home established by an American university for researchers in Sierra Leone. ""William"" was a volunteer nurse in Kenema Government Hospital and was working with Ebola patients in the hospital, according to Dr. Robert Garry of Tulane University. Garry is manager of the university's program that researches Ebola. The hospital is run by the government of Sierra Leone, but receives support from Tulane researchers. Garry said that no one else living in the house was ""significantly exposed"" and ""William"" is still in Sierra Leone. According to the Tulane doctor, ""William"" got sick on Friday and had a low viral load, meaning he wasn't infected for a long time. Garry added that the British national has a fever but none of the other symptoms of the Ebola virus. In a statement on the United Kingdom's government website Saturday, British Chief Deputy Medical Officer John Watson said the overall risk to the public in the UK is very low. Medical experts are ""assessing the situation in Sierra Leone to ensure that appropriate care is provided,"" Watson said. Ebola is one of the world's most virulent diseases, according to the World Health Organization. The virus is introduced to human populations through the human handling of infected animals -- like fruit bats, gorillas and monkeys, to name a few -- found sick or dying in the rainforest. The infection is then transmitted among humans through direct contact with the blood and bodily fluid of infected people. WHO's maps of confirmed cases show the Ebola outbreak is limited to four West African nations -- Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Nigeria. So far, nearly 2,500 suspected cases have been reported in what the WHO says is the worst known outbreak of the disease. However, the WHO's website says the survival rate for people with Ebola in this outbreak has been 47%, which is a substantial improvement over the disease's survival rate, historically. CNN's Aliza Kassim and Carma Hassan contributed to this report.","Ivory Coast is closing its borders with Guinea and Liberia, two countries dealing with an Ebola outbreak.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- An Israeli man accused of having 21 wives and fathering 49 children was charged Sunday in a Tel Aviv court with multiple counts of sexual assault, rape, sodomy and enslavement. Goel Ratzon, 60, was arrested last month. Authorities charge that he lived in a compound with the 21 wives, having convinced them that he was omnipotent. All the wives tattooed Ratzon's name and picture on their arms and the children's names are all derivatives of his name, according to the court papers. Ratzon married his first wife in 1972, added a second wife in the early 1980s, and from 1991 added another 19 wives, according to the indictment. He persuaded the women that he had the power to heal and curse, through which he gained ""complete control of their lives, desires, thoughts, emotions and actions,"" the court papers say. Ratzon spoke in court for first time last week, saying he was innocent, that everything was done with consent, and that any women who wished to leave could do so, Israeli media reported. The indictment charges that the defendant ""captured the women in a 'pseudo-family' structure that revolved around the worship of his image, making the birth of his children a supreme goal that the women must aspire to, and all this was to glorify him while serving and fulfilling all his needs."" Ratzon demanded that his wives and children completely obey all of his orders and has stringent rules and had a penalty system if they disobeyed him, the indictment alleges. He also ""abused his wives by trampling their self-worth and cut them off from any outside social contact including their families, and by this enslaved them to him and his desires,"" the court papers say. The indictment includes allegations of rape and sodomy of two of his daughters, sexual assault of another daughter, and rape, assault and sodomy of four other girls. Beyond the mental and physical control Ratzon had over his wives, he effectively controlled all of their finances, the indictment says. The women deposited major chunks of their social security payments and salaries into the family's account, paid for all of his living expenses and bought him all his property and anything he demanded, authorities charge. Ratzon's cult has been known to the authorities for about 10 years, they said, but it was only about six months ago they succeeded in convincing one of the women to file a complaint. That brought about his arrest last month. CNN's Shira Medding contributed to this report.","Goel Ratzon, 60 accused of living with 21 wives .

"(CNN) -- Arthur Sedille was up-front with police: He would often put a gun to his wife's head during fantasy sex play at their Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, home. But Sedille said he didn't know the gun was loaded when he pressed it to his wife's head and pulled the handgun's slide back during sex on the night of December 21. Now Sedille, 23, is facing the possibility of a murder charge in Canadian County, Oklahoma, in the death of his wife, 50-year-old Rebecca Sedille -- who died when the handgun went off in their bedroom. According to a probable cause affidavit filed by Oklahoma City police, Sedille said the shooting was accidental. He called 911 afterward, according to police. Investigators decided to arrest and jail Sedille on suspicion of first-degree murder out of an abundance of caution, said Oklahoma City police Master Sgt. Gary Knight. However, as of Tuesday afternoon, formal charges had not been filed in the investigation, which is ongoing, Knight said. He declined to comment on investigators' findings so far. Although a Canadian County judge found that probable cause exists to hold Sedille on the murder charge, assistant district attorney Paul Hesse said Tuesday he has yet to receive a report from police on the case. As a result, formal charges have not yet been filed, Hesse said. Sedille remained jailed Tuesday in Oklahoma County, Oklahoma. Police in Oklahoma City -- which spans five counties and 700 square miles -- book all of their prisoners into that county's jail, Knight said.

"Washington (CNN) -- White House Ebola czar Ron Klain on Tuesday downplayed the chances of Ebola being used as a biological weapon after a scare in New Zealand. Klain said he was briefed Tuesday after a small vial supposedly sent by jihadis and containing Ebola was sent to the offices of the New Zealand Herald newspaper. The newspaper sent the vial to Australia for testing. ""Based on our best information, I think the odds are high that this turns out to be a hoax,"" Klain said on CNN's ""The Lead"" with Jake Tapper. He said U.S. officials are ""always watching intelligence traffic and other indicators"" to see if terror groups are using Ebola or other diseases as biological weapons, but that ""we're not aware of any credible threat"" and that the odds of that happening are low. Klain touted the overall U.S. response to Ebola cases here and to the outbreak in West Africa, saying health officials have ""tried to learn the lessons from Dallas,"" where the first case was diagnosed in the United States, by increasing training, preparation and protective gear at health facilities nationwide. ""What we've shown now is that we can successfully identify and isolate an Ebola patient, we can make sure he doesn't infect other people, we can treat him, and we can send him home safely,"" he said. When President Barack Obama tapped Klain as his Ebola response coordinator, Republican lawmakers howled that the long-time political operative -- Klain served as Vice President Joe Biden's chief of staff and helped Obama with debate preparation during his re-election campaign -- isn't a medical professional. But Klain told Tapper on Tuesday that he isn't serving in a role that requires a medical background. ""My role isn't to give medical advice, it's to coordinate this massive response that President Obama has marshaled here at home and in Africa,"" Klain said.","Ebola czar Ron Klain says a report of Ebola being used as a weapon is likely a hoax .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A federal lawsuit accusing John Travolta of assault and sexual battery on two massage therapists includes lurid details of one of the alleged incidents. Travolta's lawyer soundly rejected the claims of both plaintiffs and called the claims of the first plaintiff ""complete fiction."" In the first incident, Travolta allegedly groped a male massage therapist repeatedly and finally masturbated himself during the two-hour session in a bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel on January 16, 2012, according to court documents filed last Friday. The first plaintiff, a Texas native who is unidentified in the court documents, ""suffered severe emotional distress,"" the lawsuit claims. The lawsuit is asking for $2 million in damages. ""This lawsuit is a complete fiction and fabrication,"" a statement from Travolta's representative said. ""None of the events claimed in the suit ever occurred."" A second male therapist, who was allegedly sexually assaulted by Travolta at an Atlanta hotel on January 25, was added to the lawsuit Tuesday. ""This second 'anonymous' claim is just as absurd and ridiculous as the first one,"" said Travolta lawyer Martin Singer on Tuesday afternoon. The Travolta statement questions why the first plaintiff is identified only as ""John Doe"" in the court filing. ""The plaintiff, who refuses to give their name, knows that the suit is a baseless lie,"" the statement said. ""It is for that reason that the plaintiff hasn't been identified with a name even though it is required to do so."" Travolta's statement said plaintiffs' attorney Okorie Okorocha filed the suit to ""get his 15 minutes of fame."" Once it is thrown out of court, Travolta will sue him for ""malicious prosecution,"" it said. Okorocha, who said his practice specializes in going after sexual predators, said he is not intimidated. ""There are many potential plaintiffs, but I am only adding them as I am able to fully investigate and vet them,"" Okorocha said. Singer said it is ""easily provable"" that Travolta was not in California on the day the first incident allegedly happened ""since John Travolta was on the East Coast working on a movie on the date that anonymous 'Doe No. 1' claims he interacted with our client."" Okorocha said he was in discussions with Travolta's lawyer for weeks before filing the suit last week and was never told this. ""I would not have filed it if they had indicated they had even McDonalds receipt to show he was anywhere but California,"" Okorocha said. Travolta was photographed at an event in Los Angeles about 30 hours before the alleged incident, he said. Travolta and his lawyer ""already conceded he was in Los Angeles on January 16, and we can prove it,"" Okorocha said. Singer said it was ""obvious"" that Okorocha ""checked media reports that my client was in Atlanta working on a movie"" before filing the second claim about an incident at an Atlanta hotel. ""However, the claim by Doe No. 2 is just as fabricated as the claim by Doe No. 1,"" Singer said. ""Our client will be fully vindicated in court on both of these absurd and fictional claims."" Travolta, 58, has been married to actress Kelly Preston for 20 years. The oldest of their three children, Jett, was 16 when he died of a seizure while the family was vacationing in the Bahamas in January 2009. 2009: Travoltas mourn the loss of their son Jett . The lawsuit, obtained by CNN, alleges that Travolta called the first plaintiff, who advertises online with ""professionally themed ads,"" to arrange for a massage at $200 an hour. Travolta picked him up in a black Lexus SUV at a Beverly Hills address and drove him to the hotel, according to the lawsuit. When they entered the bungalow, Travolta ""shamelessly stripped naked"" in front of a professional chef and the plaintiff, the lawsuit states. ""He wants me to get on the table, can you believe that?"" Travolta told the chef, according to the document. ""For the first hour the massage was without incident, other than he kept purposefully sliding the towel down that covered his buttocks to reveal about half of gluteus area,"" the suit states. The massage therapist repeatedly slid the towel back up 10 times in the first hour, ""reminding Defendant that state law required that a massage client be fully draped during the massage,"" the suit states. When Travolta ""started to rub Plaintiff's leg,"" he ""thought it was accidental,"" it said. Later, however, there was more touching by Travolta ""and this time Plaintiff told Defendant to please not touch him again,"" the complaint said. ""Defendant apologized, but then snickered to himself like a mischievous child,"" it said. The lawsuit then described Travolta allegedly touching and grabbing the massage therapist's penis. ""This was painful and uncomfortable,"" the suit said. Travolta apologized and suggested they ""must have gotten our signals crossed,"" and that he thought that the massage therapist ""wanted the same thing he did,"" it said. ""Defendant then tried to act like it was a simple misunderstanding."" Travolta then asked him to switch places on the table for a ""reverse massage,"" the lawsuit states. Travolta allegedly offered to perform a sexual act on the therapist. Although the therapist ""felt very afraid for his safety,"" he agreed to stay and continue with the massage after Travolta told him ""OK, I'll behave myself,"" the suit said. Travolta's statement ""gave plaintiff confidence that his predatory behavior was finally under control,"" the suit said. When he resumed with a deep tissue massage on his shoulders, Travolta told him, ""Say something nice to me,"" it said. Travolta, who allegedly began masturbating, then got up and screamed at the plaintiff ""how selfish he was; that Defendant got where he is now due to sexual favors he had performed when he was in his 'Welcome Back Kotter' days,"" the suit said. Hollywood is controlled by homosexual men ""who expect favors in return for sexual activity,"" the lawsuit document quotes Travolta as saying. ""Defendant then went on to say how he had done things in his past that would make most people throw up,"" it said. The complaint said Travolta told the therapist that ""he was smart enough to learn to enjoy it, and when he began to make millions of dollars, that it all became well worth it."" When the therapist refused to take part, Travolta said, ""No problem. I will find new friends,"" the suit said. He then offered to call a ""Hollywood starlet"" who wanted ""three-way sex,"" but ""they needed to have sex together first before calling her, so this way they would be in-sync with each other sexually,"" the suit said. The actor told him he could ""make millions and be famous"" if he lost some weight and adapted to same-sex relations, the suit said. When the therapist threatened to call police if he was not returned to where he was picked up, Travolta drove him back, although calling him ""selfish"" and a ""loser"" on the way, it said. He paid the therapist $800, double the $400 owed for the two hours, the suit said.

"(CNN) -- A designer clothing store, a comic book store, a tattoo parlor and a ... women for sale store. This unusual window display shocked shoppers at a busy Tel Aviv mall last week when among the run-of-the-mill shops, they came across a group of young women standing in a storefront. On them were price tags detailing their age, weight, height, dimensions and country of origin. Organizers said the campaign is designed to bring awareness to women trafficking. It aims to collect enough signatures to pressure the Israeli justice ministry to back legislation that makes it a crime for men to go to prostitutes. This legislation is the next important step in the fight against women trafficking, said attorney Ori Keidar, one of the founders of the task force against the problem. ""The legislation against the prostitutes' customers will bring a reduction in the demand for prostitution and it will be a less lucrative business for crime organizations,"" Keidar said. ""This in turn will bring a reduction in the trafficking of women."" Keidar said the legislation is modeled after similar legislation in Sweden that has drastically reduced trafficking and prostitution. Over the past decade, about 10,000 women have been trafficked into Israel in what Keidar calls ""modern slavery."" The women are locked, beaten, raped, starved and forced to receive 15-30 men a day 365 days a year, according to the attorney. About three years ago, Israeli police greatly reduced women trafficking by pouring resources into the problem. Security forces have also helped by stepping up patrols on the Israeli-Egyptian border as a result of al Qaeda presence in the Sinai. This 300-kilometer border was the main route for smuggling women into Israel, Keidar said. ""This legislation against the customers will bring a further reduction in trafficking and with a little more pressure we can make this go away"" Keidar said.","The women have price tags detailing their age, weight and height .
The tags also include their dimensions and country of origin .

"(CNN) -- Relatives of slain California 8-year-old Sandra Cantu expressed ""shock"" Saturday at news that a neighbor -- a Sunday school teacher whose daughter was a playmate of Sandra's -- was arrested in the girl's death. Melissa Huckaby was charged with kidnapping and murder in the death of 8-year-old Sandra Cantu. ""Just utter shock and disbelief,"" Sandra's aunt Angie Chavez told CNN affiliate KOVR. ""I can't imagine a mother doing this to a child."" Melissa Huckaby, 28, was booked into the San Joaquin County Jail early Saturday and faces charges of kidnapping and murder in the death of Sandra in Tracy, California. Sandra was last seen March 27 in the Tracy mobile home park where she lived with her family -- the same mobile home park where Huckaby lives. The girl's body was found Monday, stuffed into a suitcase submerged in a pond at a dairy farm. ""We have to live the rest of our lives without Sandra. [Huckaby] is in jail. She can still see her little girl grow up,"" Sandra's uncle, Joe Chavez, told KOVR. He said the family is ""shell-shocked"" and hopes that in time they can learn to trust people again. ""Who can you trust at this point?"" he said. ""Who do you know?"" A police spokesman told reporters Saturday he ""couldn't begin to theorize"" a motive for Sandra's death.  Watch police discuss the arrest » . Huckaby is the granddaughter of Clifford Lane Lawless, pastor at the Clover Road Baptist Church, which was searched as part of the investigation, Tracy police Sgt. Tony Sheneman told reporters. Huckaby taught Sunday school at the church, he said. In addition, Huckaby's 5-year-old daughter was close friends with Sandra, who often played at Huckaby's home. Earlier Saturday, Sheneman said he did not believe Huckaby had retained an attorney. In a Friday interview with the Tracy Press newspaper, Huckaby acknowledged owning the black rolling suitcase that held Sandra's body, but said she reported it missing the day before the girl's body was found. She said it disappeared the same day the girl was last seen. ""There's been a lot of speculation on the news about what happened to my suitcase,"" she told the newspaper. ""It's not my granddad's. It's mine, and someone took it."" Police said Huckaby lives in the same mobile home complex where Sandra lived with her family; the Tracy Press reported Huckaby lives with her grandparents. Police noted ""inconsistencies"" between comments Huckaby made to the newspaper and a previous statement she gave authorities, Sheneman said. It was one reason police asked her Friday to come to the station to be interviewed again. She drove there about 6 p.m. Friday, he said. Authorities believe Huckaby lied about the suitcase being missing, Sheneman said. Asked whether authorities believe Sandra's death was planned, Sheneman said the question is ""not something I can answer right now"" but ""we do have an indication."" He said authorities have found where they believe the girl was killed, but would not divulge that location to reporters. ""I couldn't begin to theorize what her motive is,"" Sheneman said of Huckaby. During the Friday night interview with police, Huckaby was ""very relaxed for a bit, and then she became very emotional, and then she became relaxed again"" before appearing resigned, Sheneman said. He declined to say whether Huckaby had confessed, but said ""she revealed enough information that we had probable cause to arrest her."" Huckaby was booked into the San Joaquin County Jail about 3:25 a.m. (6:25 a.m. ET), according to the county sheriff's Web site. She is set to appear in court Tuesday. Police took Huckaby into custody about 11:15 p.m. Friday (2:15 a.m. ET Saturday), Sheneman said, but she chose to continue talking with them for more than two hours. Authorities told Sandra's family of the arrest about 2:15 a.m. local time, he said. ""They were in disbelief.""  Watch neighbors remember slain girl » . Police have had contact with Huckaby before, but she does not have a record of violence, Sheneman said, but did not elaborate. He said no other arrests are expected in Sandra's death. Citing court records, the Tracy Press reported Huckaby pleaded no contest January 9 to a felony charge of second-degree commercial burglary and a misdemeanor charge of property theft with a prior theft, burglary or robbery. A criminal complaint says she was jailed in Los Angeles County on a property theft conviction in 2006 and that she attempted to steal from a store in November 2008. According to the complaint, she is on probation in San Joaquin County and is due back in court April 17. Asked about the court records, Huckaby told the newspaper it wasn't her and that she did not know why the address and cell phone number in the court documents match her own. ""I don't know what to say,"" she said. ""That's not me."" Police believe that by the time Sandra was reported missing, she was already dead, Tracy Police Chief Janet Thiessen told reporters Saturday. ""There was some speculation early on that [the suspect] would be a man,"" Sheneman said Saturday. ""It's unusual for a woman -- statistically, according to the FBI -- to be involved in anything like this."" The day Sandra was last reported seen, she returned home from school, kissed her mother and left to play with a friend who lives nearby. A short time later, wearing a pink Hello Kitty T-shirt and black leggings, she left to go to another friend's home, according to a family spokeswoman. Police said the girl's clothing helped them identify her body. Huckaby told the Tracy Press that Sandra stopped by her home that day to ask if she could play with Huckaby's daughter, but Huckaby refused because she wanted her daughter to pick up her toys. Sandra left for another friend's home, Huckaby told the newspaper. How Sandra died has not been made public. An autopsy was conducted earlier in the week, but CNN affiliate KRON-TV said results are not expected for weeks. Thiessen said Saturday any autopsy information as well as search warrants filed in the case remain under seal.","NEW: ""I can't imagine a mother doing this to a child,"" Sandra Cantu's aunt says .

"(CNN) -- The United States, land of freedom and opportunity, is also the land of scowling faces and folded arms, according to a new poll. Travel magazine Conde Nast Traveler has unveiled the results of its annual readers' choice survey. More than 46,000 readers gave their opinions last year on everything from favorite airlines to best hotels and friendliest and unfriendliest cities. It's the latter category that might cause the most surprises, with U.S. cities dominating the ""unfriendly"" list. Newark, New Jersey, is the unfriendliest city in the world according to the survey. ""Newark is best known for being the site of an airport near New York, and for many of our readers, that's the only reason to stop there,"" says Conde Nast Traveler. In total, five U.S. cities were voted into the top 10 unfriendly cities list and eight made the top 20. Oakland, California (third), ""has an image problem and a split personality"" according to a reader who answered the survey. New Haven, Connecticut (seventh), home of Yale University, is the city of ""rude, unfriendly folks;"" Detroit (eighth) was called the ""armpit of the world"" by one reader and Atlantic City, New Jersey (ninth), was dismissed as a ""pale shadow of Las Vegas."" Other cities in the list include Islamabad in Pakistan (second least friendly), Luanda in Angola (fourth), Kuwait City (fifth) Lome in Togo (sixth) and Tangier in Morocco (tenth). What do you think?

"(CNN) -- A highly anticipated test of an experimental Ebola vaccine will begin next week at the National Institutes of Health, amid mounting anxiety about the spread of the deadly virus in West Africa. After an expedited review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, researchers were given the green light to begin what's called a human safety trial, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. It will be the first test of this type of Ebola vaccine in humans. The experimental vaccine, developed by the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline and the NIAID, will first be given to three healthy human volunteers to see if they suffer any adverse effects. If deemed safe, it will then be given to another small group of volunteers, aged 18 to 50, to see if it produces a strong immune response to the virus. All will be monitored closely for side effects. The vaccine will be administered to volunteers by an injection in the deltoid muscle of their arm, first in a lower dose, then later in a higher dose after the safety of the vaccine has been determined. Some of the preclinical studies that are normally done on these types of vaccines were waived by the FDA during the expedited review, Fauci said, so ""we want to take extra special care that we go slowly with the dosing."" The vaccine did extremely well in earlier trials with chimpanzees, Fauci said. He noted that the method being used to prompt an immune response to Ebola cannot cause a healthy individual to become infected with the virus. Still, he said, ""I have been fooled enough in my many years of experience... you really can't predict what you will see (in humans)."" According to the NIH, the vaccine will also be tested on healthy volunteers in the United Kingdom, Gambia and Mali, once details are finalized with health officials in those countries. Trials cannot currently be done in the four countries affected by the recent outbreak -- Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria -- because the existing health care infrastructure wouldn't support them, Fauci said. Gambia and Mali were selected because the NIH has ""long-standing collaborative relationships"" with researchers in those countries. According to the NIH, officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are also in talks with health officials from Nigeria about conducting part of the safety trial there. Funding from an international consortium formed to fight Ebola will enable GlaxoSmithKline to begin manufacturing up to 10,000 additional doses of the vaccine while clinical trials are ongoing, the pharmaceutical company said in a statement. These doses would be made available if the World Health Organization decides to allow emergency immunizations in high-risk communities. The GSK/NIAID vaccine is one of two leading candidate vaccines. The other was developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada and licensed this month to NewLink Genetics, a company based in Iowa. According to the NIH, safety trials of that vaccine will start this fall. Earlier this month, the Canadian government shipped what it said was ""800 to 1,000"" doses of that vaccine to Liberia, at the government's request. It's not clear whether it has been given to health workers or anyone else there. Worth noting: in 2009, an earlier version of the vaccine was given to a lab worker in Germany after he thought he had pricked himself with a needle tainted with Ebola. He did not develop the disease. While there currently is no proven treatment for Ebola beyond supportive care, government agencies and small biotech firms have been scrambling to speed up development of several potential therapies and vaccines. A third vaccine, also developed by the NIH, was recently tested in primates and found to protect them from infection; it was given in combination with Depovax, an adjuvant that has been used with other vaccines and cancer therapies to boost the body's immune response. While vaccines might be given to prevent infection among health workers or other people thought to be at high risk, development has also been speeded up on drugs that might potentially be given to patients who already have the disease. The drug that's received the most attention is ZMapp, which has been given to at least seven individuals in the current outbreak, including two American missionary medical workers, Nancy Writebol and Dr. Kent Brantly. The drug has never been formally tested in humans, and while the results in human patients are encouraging -- five of the seven known to have received it are still alive -- experts say there is too little data to say whether it played a role in their recoveries. Are myths making the Ebola outbreak worse? Earlier versions of ZMapp, which received backing from the U.S. and Canadian governments as well as from biotech firms, have shown some ability to protect rhesus macaque monkeys more than two days after they were infected with the virus. Another drug, TKM-Ebola, has been tested for safety in a small number of humans. That trial was put on hold in January, after one volunteer developed moderate gastrointestinal side effects after receiving a high dose of the medication. Last week, the FDA modified the hold to a ""partial clinical hold."" In effect, this means that Tekmira could potentially be allowed to give the drug to doctors or hospitals who request it, on an emergency basis. There's no indication that the company has received any such requests. The vaccine going into trials next week is based on an adenovirus -- a type of cold virus -- that's found in chimpanzees. The virus delivers genetic material derived from two species of Ebola virus, including the Zaire strain that's responsible for the current outbreak. Those genes are meant to trigger the development of antibodies in the person who receives the vaccine, antibodies that can specifically defend against Ebola. Another trial, using a version of the GSK/NIAID vaccine that uses only the Zaire strain of Ebola, will be launched in October, according to the NIH. All participants in the trial will be evaluated nine times over a 48-week period. NIH expects to reveal the results of the trial by the end of the year. If it's approved for widespread use, the first priority will be to give the vaccine to health care workers or lab workers who are fighting the spread of the virus, Fauci said. It will then be considered for people in the communities where outbreaks occur. Nine things to know about the killer disease . What happens when you survive Ebola?

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- The lawyer for a 30-year-old Palestinian married father of two who has admitted in a plea bargain to rape by deception said Wednesday he will appeal his client's sentence, which was handed up Monday. ""Eighteen months in prison is too much,"" said Adnan Aladdin. He is representing Saber Kashour, a Palestinian living in east Jerusalem who admitted pretending to be a single Jewish man before having sex with an Israeli woman. Kashour already has been detained for two months, followed by about two years of house arrest, his lawyer said. ""According to the bargain, he should be punished, but we expect him to receive community service on appeal in about 30 days' time,"" Aladdin added. Kashour told CNN the relations with the woman, who has not been identified publicly, were consensual. ""The girl is the one who started flirting with me and talking to me, and she is the one who wanted the thing from beginning to end,"" he said. ""I met her on a West Jerusalem street, she approached me and started flirting with me. Within 15 minutes, she wanted to be with me, and we were together."" Aladdin described his client's liaison in more detail: ""There was a short foreplay a few minutes before; during the foreplay, the guy tells a few lies, the lady tells a few lies. They both have one goal, and that is to go to bed together. After the sexual intercourse, which was totally consensual, the lady decides to claim that the guy raped her brutally. She comes to court and testifies that this was a case of rape in which there was the use of force. ""At this stage, the defense decides to make an independent investigation. The investigation came up with new facts upon which the D.A. [district attorney] decides to give up the claim the sex was not consensual. So both sides agreed that the sexual intercourse was consensual. However, the D.A. still wanted to charge him with rape by deception. ""So this is the best the defense could do in this case. We are appealing the very long sentence."" Kashour, who acknowledged having told the woman he was single, said he is known as ""Dudu,"" a nickname for the Jewish name ""David,"" but also his own nickname. ""Apparently, later she discovered that I was an Arab and complained to the police,"" he said. ""I did not say anything or commit anything wrong,"" he insisted, adding that he did not understand how his misrepresentations could result in a rape charge. ""If I told the woman I was a pilot and later she finds out that I was not a pilot, then she goes and says that 'He raped me'? If I told her that I was a millionaire and it turns out that I am a poor man, then she goes and says that 'He raped me'?"" ""It is terrible, but the law says very clearly that if someone has sexual intercourse using deception about his identity to conduct the act, it can be considered rape,"" said Leah Samael, a lawyer specializing in civil rights and human rights cases. But, if the circumstances had been different -- if a religious Jew had said he was not religious in order to woo a potential suitor -- ""he would not be brought to court,"" she said. ""And I am not sure that, on this occasion, it is a reason to charge. To have intercourse in daytime in a deserted building in the center of town -- I say the circumstances speak for themselves."" She added, ""The thing that interests me in the case is the need, the necessity, of Arabs in Israel to pretend. To speak without an accent so as not to be seen as Arabs. To dress not to look like Arabs."" She predicted Kashour would prevail. ""I don't know if he will be acquitted, but he has served his punishment,"" she said. Criminal law rarely applies to minor lies, like dyed hair or a changed name,"" said Dana Pugach of the Noga Legal Center for Victims of Crime. ""But it would apply to the more meaningful lies,"" she said. ""For example, where a doctor persuades a woman to have sex claiming it would be a part of the medical treatment. As for this particular case, it is not the fact that he was an Arab and claimed to be Jewish. The court emphasized the fact that he claimed to be single while he was married, which would be relevant in the context of a romantic relationship."" Kashour expressed regret, but not for the alleged victim. ""I would only be upset and regret this because I have put my wife through pain and upset her, but I did not [do] anything wrong with the girl."" His is the second conviction on the charge of rape by deception. In 2008, the Israeli High Court of Justice convicted Zvi Sliman for impersonating an official in the Housing Ministry and promising women help and benefits to persuade them to have sex with him. Sliman was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Azriel Guy, Kareem Khadder and Paul Colsey contributed to this report from Jerusalem.","Saber Kashour pretended to be single and Jewish before having sex with an Israeli woman .

"BUTTE, Montana (CNN)  -- Three families with young children were heading to a ski vacation together when their plane crashed into a cemetery in Montana, loved ones of the victims said Monday. Dr. Erin Jacobson and his family, shown here in a photo from November, were killed in the crash. Federal investigators said that with no flight data recorder or cockpit voice recorder on the plane and no survivors, an investigation into what caused the crash could last months. ""This is going to take a while,"" National Transportation Safety Board Acting Chairman Mark Rosenker said at a news conference Monday. Investigators are looking into whether the single-engine plane was overloaded, what role weather may have played in the accident and what made the pilot decide to divert to Butte, he said. He urged reporters not to ""jump to conclusions"" about the crash. Early speculation focused on the fact that there were 14 people aboard the 10-seat aircraft, but Rosenker said young children often travel on the laps of adult passengers and urged reporters not to rush to judgment about the cause of the crash. ""To jump to conclusions is a disservice to your readers and to those who are watching your broadcasts,"" he said. ""This will be a long and tedious investigation -- extremely thorough. We will look at every factor which could affect the performance of this aircraft."" Investigators said seven adults and seven children were on board, and all died in the crash Sunday. Authorities have not publicly identified the victims. But colleagues and loved ones have named all 14.  Watch friend describe how victim was ""like family"" » . On Monday some of the victims' relatives visited the site of the wreck. St. Helena Hospital in St. Helena, California, said an ophthalmologist who worked there was killed, along with his family. ""The St. Helena Hospital family is filled with such deep sadness over the deaths of Dr. Erin Jacobson, his wife Amy, and their three children, Taylor, Ava and Jude,"" the hospital said in a written statement, adding, ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends of each victim of this terrible tragedy."" A friend of the Jacobson family said the Jacobson children were 4, 3, and 2 years of age. A dental practice in Valley Springs, California, said dentist Michael Pullen and his wife, Vanessa, were on the plane with their 9-year-old daughter, Sydney, and 7-year-old son, Christopher. The family is from Galt, California. Dr. James DuHamel of DuHamel & Pullen Family Dental said the two families were related. Vanessa Pullen, a physician in Elk Grove, was the sister of Amy Jacobson, he said. DuHamel said Pullen was ""a fantastic dentist,"" and added that he will ""miss him greatly."" Adrian Cotton, whose wife is a sister of Vanessa Pullen and Amy Jacobson, is acting as a spokesman for the families. The third family was that of Dr. Brent Ching, a dentist in Chico, California, his office confirmed without providing further comment. Ching was accompanied by his wife Kristen and children Hailey, 5, and Caleb, 3, Hostetter said. Cotton said the pilot on the plane was Bud Summerfield, who was not related to any of the victims. While investigators continue to look into the crash, it is unclear whether details of what happened will ever be known. There is no requirement for a cockpit voice recorder or a flight data recorder on such private planes. Rosenker said there might be some avionics -- electronic systems that private planes can use for a variety of purposes -- that might contain some information, though they are not built to withstand crashes. A CNN crew at the crash site, Holy Cross Cemetery, could see no large chunks of the plane, a single-engine Pilatus PC-12. But Rosenker said ""portions of all major structural components"" had been identified.  Watch footage from the crash site » . Some visitors set up crosses outside the gates of the cemetery to serve as a makeshift memorial. Others brought flowers. The flight was headed to Bozeman, Montana, but was rerouted to Butte, said Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Mike Fergus. The plane crashed 500 feet short of the runway at Bert Mooney Airport. No one was injured on the ground, Sheriff John Walsh said. The weather, which was clear Sunday, does not appear to have been a factor.  See a map of the crash site » . The plane was designed to carry 11 people -- two in the cockpit and nine in the cabin, said Rosenker. He noted that young children often travel on the laps of adult passengers. Martha Guidoni said she and her husband witnessed the plane crash. She photographed one of the first images from the scene, which showed the cemetery in the foreground of a huge blaze. iReport.com: iReporter at scene of crash . ""We were just taking a ride -- all of a sudden, we watched this plane just take a nosedive,"" she said. ""We drove into the cemetery to see if there was any way my husband could help someone. We were too late -- there was nothing to help."" Her husband, Steve Guidoni, said the plane ""went into the ground"" and ignited a tree. ""I looked to see if there was anybody I could pull out, but there wasn't anything there; I couldn't see anything,"" he said. ""There was some luggage strewn around. ... There was some plane parts.""  Watch witness describe what he saw » . A flight plan said the plane originated in Redlands, California, according to flight-tracking site FBOweb.com. Stops were made in Vacaville and Oroville, California, before the plane headed for Montana. The plane stopped at the Oroville airport about 11 a.m., refueled and departed about half an hour later, said Police Chief Kirk Trostle. The Oroville airport does not have a control tower. Eric Teitelman, Oroville's director of community development and public works, said that because it has a ""wide-open runway"" and a self-service fuel system, it is a frequent stop for general aviation aircraft. There were conflicting reports about ownership of the plane, which was manufactured in 2001.

"Berlin, Germany (CNN) -- The Germans are known to be pessimists, so it is probably no wonder that the announcement of record growth in the first quarter of this year didn't excite too many people in one of Berlin's main shopping areas at the Kurfürstendamm. ""I have not seen an economic upswing,"" one student said, ""nothing has changed for ordinary people."" But the economists at Germany's Federal Statistics Office take a somewhat different view. According to figures published on Friday they say Germany's second quarter economic growth of 2.2 percent -- the largest since German unification -- is due in part to an increase in private consumption. That's significant because Europe's largest economy has often been criticized by its neighbors for exporting a lot, but consuming very little. That has not changed even with the positive economic data. ""If we look at what the statistical office tells us we see that consumption has increased a little, but it is not really what made the difference,"" says Jörg Rocholl, an economist from the European School of Management and Technology in Berlin. Once again it was German exports that made the difference. With companies like BMW and Siemens recently posting impressive numbers thanks to robust demand from abroad. ""Germany's economy is very competitive, it is now seeing the recovery that is led by demand for products from China, the U.S. and other countries,"" Rocholl adds. But Germany wouldn't be Germany if there wasn't at least some pessimism even with the record numbers. Already some experts warn that demand for German products abroad might wane of China suffers and economic downturn. Furthermore, Germany's unemployment has remained fairly stable throughout the crisis. Thanks in part to a government-induced short labor program, that will soon expire. The question for many Germans is, will the good times last? Rocholl believes they could: ""The flexibility we've achieved over the last 10 years will also help us in the long term."" Germany's minister for economics, Rainer Brüderle, doesn't seem to share his fellow Germans' pessimism. He has called the data an ""upswing in an XL format."" On Berlin's Kufürstendamm shopping street not many share that view. But then again, Germans have always fared well with their pessimism -- under promising and often overperforming.","Germany recorded second quarter economic growth of 2.2 percent .

"(CNN) -- The results of the midterm election confirm Americans' widespread discontent with Washington gridlock on a range of issues. In the last few months, millions of people contacted the White House, Congress and federal agencies to demand action on one of those issues -- protecting a free and open Internet. Their message was overwhelmingly clear: Americans don't want fast and slow lanes online. They want the government to preserve the Internet as a place where everybody -- startups, small businesses, nonprofits, activists, and independent artists -- has an equal chance of reaching people. Yet it appears their voices have fallen on deaf ears. The Federal Communications Commission, tasked with creating new rules to protect the Internet, appears to be favoring a proposal that will allow fast lanes after all. As the New York Times reports, the proposal would permit Internet service providers (ISPs) like Comcast and Verizon to charge Internet applications, content or services access fees for faster service, as long as those fees are ""just and reasonable."" The proposal is bad policy and rests on shaky legal foundations. If some companies can pay so that their content loads faster and reaches people easier, then small businesses and startups won't have a chance to compete. Innovation as we know it will suffer. In fact, the proposal harms anyone who can't pay to be in the fast lane, making it harder for everyday people to create, connect and organize online. It's no wonder that 3.7 million Americans, more than 70 members of Congress, and President Obama have come out against fast lanes. So far, the FCC is not listening. But it's not too late. The FCC should take this week's midterm results as a wake-up call to listen to the public. It should ban access fees and stop the creation of fast lanes in a way that will be upheld in court. Net neutrality explained . In order to ban access fees, the FCC must reclassify the ISPs that connect us to the Internet as common carriers under Title II of the Communications Act. That's the only way to ban these fees, and that's what the agency should do. But instead, it seems to be leaning toward a confusing ""hybrid"" proposal that creates two legal categories for the service offered by ISPs â€” a ""wholesale"" service that allows companies like Google, Yahoo! and Netflix to reach us, and a ""retail"" service that connects us to the Internet. The FCC wants to classify only the wholesale side under Title II. Under this ""hybrid"" proposal, the FCC would decide case-by-case whether specific access fees are just, reasonable and non-discriminatory. This approach provides little certainty to entrepreneurs and investors, creates high regulatory costs, and tilts the playing field against those who don't have the resources, time and money to engage in long and costly proceedings at the FCC. Worst of all, it still allows access fees and fast lanes. Any access fees, no matter how ""reasonable,"" will crush innovation in America. If Comcast offered a fast lane to Netflix, the FCC could potentially force it to make a similar offer to Hulu and YouTube. But if a video startup couldn't pay the fee, then it would never have the chance to compete in the first place. Think of what we'd lose. Innovators with little or no outside funding have produced some of the most important sites -- such as Google, Facebook, Yahoo, and eBay -- and economic research suggests that such innovators will continue to fuel our nation's economic growth. Even companies that remain small create jobs and provide value to customers. But there's more that we'd lose. Large corporations that pay to be in the fast lane will have higher costs, so we the customers will be forced to pay higher prices for their products and services. Small businesses that rely on the Internet to reach their customers will be shut out of the market. Worse, all noncommercial actors will be in the slow lane -- educators, artists, activists, nonprofits, underserved communities, and the list goes on. This will harm democratic discourse as we know it. As if this wasn't bad enough, the FCC's proposal is also likely to fail in court. The proposal appears to prevent ISPs from blocking or discriminating against sites, but it relies on a new, untested legal foundation that does not actually allow the FCC to adopt such rules. And while this legal foundation empowers the agency to police access fees, it does not grant it the authority to ban them. So even if the FCC wanted to improve its rules and ban access fees, any attempt to do so under its proposed ""hybrid"" approach would likely be struck down in court. From the FCC's perspective, the proposal might seem like a compromise. It improves the FCC's ability to police access fees, but does not actually ban them. It involves Title II, but does not reclassify ISPs. But we are not getting the benefit of the bargain. The proposed rules fail to protect the Internet, pose high social costs, and will most likely be struck down in court. And as ISPs have made abundantly clear, they oppose ""hybrid"" proposals just as strongly as reclassification and will fight them tooth and nail. Fortunately, there is a better ""compromise"" on the table. The FCC should reclassify Internet service under Title II and then lift (or in legal terms, ""forebear from"") all regulations that are not needed to protect consumers. This route would allow the FCC to pursue a light regulatory touch that protects ISPs' incentives to invest while adopting bright-line rules that ban blocking, discrimination, and access fees. The FCC is at a fork in the road. It could turn its back on sound policy and public opinion and pursue fast lanes, or it could adopt meaningful rules that protect the American people and will be upheld in court. The correct path is clear.","Barbara van Schewick: Americans want a free and open Internet, not a fast and slow lane .

"(CNN) -- Frank Ramano is upset about an airline misplacing some very precious cargo on a recent flight: his dog, Ty. A week later, Ty is still missing. ""I have no clue how they could just lose a pet like that,"" Ramano told CNN affiliate WTSP in Tampa, Florida. Ramano said he booked Ty on the October 31 Delta flight from Los Angeles to Tampa because he would be in Florida for several weeks and didn't want to leave his best friend behind. A Delta representative told CNN that the airline is doing everything it can to aid in the search for Ty. ""Delta continues to investigate what happened, but early indications show procedures were followed, and the dog may have compromised the kennel on its own,"" Morgan Durrant, a Delta spokesman, said in a statement. Ramano told WTSP that he is incredibly frustrated with the airline because he was originally told the dog made it to Tampa, but the airline has since changed its story. ""To me, it sounds like they don't care. They sound like they lost just a piece of baggage. That's it. He's family. He's like my best friend,"" Ramano said of the 6-year-old dog, whom he rescued last year from a shelter in North Hollywood. Airline apologizes as lost cat dies . But, Ramano said, it was Ty who did the rescuing. At the time of the adoption, Ramano was homeless and bouncing from motel to motel. ""He was like a big anxiety pill. He would help me through the rough times,"" he told WTSP. The effort to bring Ty home is ongoing. Durrant said Delta has refunded the fee to transport Ty, and workers are still diligently searching for the dog, including in Los Angeles-area shelters as Ty was microchipped, according to Ramano. ""Delta understands that pets are an important member of the family and regrets this occurred while this pet was entrusted to our care,"" the statement from Delta said. ""I just want him home safe. I just want him back,"" Ramano said. This is not the first time a pet has gone missing in transit with Delta. In 2010, passenger Josiah Allen's dog Paco broke out of his carrier before a flight from Mexico to Canada. And in 2006, Vivi, a whippet who competed in the Westminster Kennel Club show, escaped on the tarmac at John F. Kennedy International Airport before a flight.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Robin Thicke's summertime hit ""Blurred Lines"" is an illegal rip-off of Marvin Gaye's ""Got to Give It Up,"" Gaye's children claim in court documents filed Wednesday. Fans, journalists and music experts immediately recognized similarities between Gaye's 1977 hit and the 2013's summertime smash, Gaye's heirs contend. The controversy is a high-stakes legal fight involving an alleged conflict of interest with Sony-ATV, the music publisher half-owned by Michael Jackson's estate. Gaye's heirs not only accuse Thicke and ""Blurred Lines"" co-writers Pharrell Williams and ""T.I."" Clifford Harris Jr. of copying Gaye's song, but they also contend Sony-ATV failed to meet its responsibility to protect the copyright. The Gaye family contracted with Sony-ATV after the singer-songwriter's death to administer his music catalog, but it also represents Williams' songs, according to a counterclaim filed Wednesday in response to a lawsuit filed by Thicke, Williams and Harris. The publisher, however, refused to sue the ""Blurred Lines"" writers when the family asked them to do so, the Gaye's lawyer said. As a result they ""reluctantly"" included Sony-ATV as a defendant in their counterclaim, he said. The ""Blurred Lines"" writers filed their pre-emptive lawsuit in August asking a federal judge to declare that their song was not a copyright infringement on Gaye's work amid public rumblings about the similarities. Thicke's inital lawsuit contends there are ""no similarities"" between his song and Gaye's ""other than commonplace musical elements"" ""Being reminiscent of a 'sound' is not copyright infringement,"" his complaint argues. The Gaye family counterclaim includes Thicke quotes from an interview with Billboard Magazine published in July. ""Pharrell and I were in the studio making a couple records, and then on the third day I told him I wanted to do something kinda like Marvin Gaye's 'Got To Give It Up,' that kind of feel 'cause it's one of my favorite songs of all time,"" Thicke reportedly said. ""So he started messing with some drums and then he started going 'hey, hey, hey' and about an hour and a half later we had the whole record finished.""Â . Who owns happy birthday? Lawsuit seeks return of millions . The filing also quotes what music journalist wrote about the two songs. New York Times writer Rob Hoerburger: ""And that bass line came right from Marvin Gaye's No. 1 hit from the summer of '77, 'Got to Give It Up'."" Rolling Stone magazine contributor David Ritz: ""When I first heard Robin Thicke's 'Blurred Lines,' my reaction was the same as millions of other R&B fans: Hey, that's Marvin Gaye's 'Got to Give It Up.' "" Vice magazine music critic Paul Cantor: ""You probably don't feel guilty for liking 'Blurred Lines.' Maybe that's because it was originally a Marvin Gaye song (""Got To Give It Up"") and Marvin Gaye is ... awesome."" The filing by the heirs also includes a report from musicologist Judith Finell, who identified a ""constellation of at least eight substantially similar compositional features between the two works."" ""The signature phrase, vocal hook, backup vocal hook, their variations, and the keyboard and bass lines"" are substantially similar and they share ""departures from convention such as the unusual cowbell instrumentation, omission of guitar and use of male falsetto,"" it said. Gaye's heirs also accuse Thicke of stealing from their father's 1976 hit ""After the Dance"" when he recorded ""Love After War"" in 2011. Those tunes ""contain substantially similar compositional material in their choruses, including the melodies of their hooks,"" the Gaye filing contends. The family suggests that Thicke has a ""Marvin Gaye fixation."" ""Blurred Lines"" stayed at the top of Billboard's pop chart for a record 16 weeks this summer and sold more than 6 million copies, according to court documents. 'To Kill a Mockingbird' novelist sues over trademark . CNN's Denise Quan contributed to this report.","Gaye family also contends Thicke's ""Love After War"" copied Gaye's ""After the Dance""

"(CNN) -- My name is Bailee Madison and I am blessed to be the youth spokesperson for Alex's Lemonade Stand, a foundation that is very dear to my heart. Few people have the opportunity to impact the lives of thousands, even over an entire lifetime. Alex Scott accomplished more in much less time. Alex was diagnosed with neuroblastoma, a type of childhood cancer, shortly before her first birthday. Around 2000, at age 4, Alex asked her mom if she could start a lemonade stand to raise money for pediatric cancer research. She wanted to help the doctors find a way to make other children like her feel better. She continued to put up lemonade stands until she lost her battle with cancer four years later in 2004, at the age of 8. By that time Alex had raised over a million dollars for pediatric cancer research. I was so inspired by Alex's story that I always say ""You are never too young to make a difference."" Alex Scott has proven that to be true. Today, Alex's parents, Liz and Jay Scott, have continued her mission to find a cure for pediatric cancer. Since 2005, Alex's Lemonade Stand has raised over $80 million for cancer research. In addition to research, last year alone, ALSF provided over 100 flights, 440 nights of lodging, and 300 gas cards to help families travel for a child's treatment. These are all results of people like you and me holding lemonade stands. Every dollar we raise brings us one step closer to finding a cure. Last week, I had the opportunity to join the annual Alex's ""Original"" Lemonade Stand at Alex's elementary school in Philadelphia to help kick off National Lemonade Days. It was an amazing day. The stand brought over 3,000 people and raised nearly $100,000. The following day, I had a lemonade stand of my own with my 10-year-old friend, Charlotte, in my hometown of Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Although we didn't raise nearly as much money, it was equally as exciting to see my friends and family join together for the same cause, knowing that it it could be ANY one of the dollars raised by ANY of us that will lead to a cure. Alex's dream is still very much alive. I hope that you will join me and the many others who are continuing Alex's dream to find a cure for childhood cancer, one cup at a time.","Bailee Madison shows kids how to fight childhood cancer by selling lemonade .

"Washington (CNN) -- Rep. Vance McAllister, R-Louisiana, now known as the ""Kissing Congressman"" after the married father of five was caught on surveillance tape making out with a staffer who is also married, says his affair, despite his Christian conservative political platform, will not sideline his new political career. He said he will run for reelection unless ""an outcry"" of opposition persuades him not to. The fate of cheating politicians is a mixed bag. Some survive and some don't. Bill Clinton survived. Anthony Weiner and numerous other members of Congress did not, forced to resign or not seek reelection. But this story isn't about them. It's about the women who are the other half of politicians' extramarital affairs. And in many instances, when high-profile politicians cheat, their mistresses have a harder time recovering. Here's a look at where some of them are now: . Melissa Hixon Peacock: The latest ""other woman"" in a political affair is the staffer caught kissing McAllister. While McAllister maintains he will finish out his term, Peacock no longer has her job as his district scheduler. Her husband, Heath Peacock, told CNN that McAllister ""wrecked his life"" and marriage. Monica Lewinsky: She might be the most famous political mistress. Since her affair with Clinton, Lewinsky is attempting to live a normal life, her former publicist told CNN recently. Years later, Lewinsky is still ""trying"" to live a normal life. After a brief stint in the spotlight after Clinton's impeachment, the former White House intern has lived in relative obscurity. Rielle Hunter: One-time vice presidential nominee John Edwards has moved on since his 2008 affair with Hunter broke up his marriage, sunk his presidential campaign and bore a child. He recently started practicing law again. Hunter, on the other hand, has not had the same good fortune. She recently released an updated version of the book about the affair in which she apologizes for her behavior -- that included writing a book that ""hurt more people."" Cynthia Hampton: She was involved with former Nevada Sen. John Ensign. Both Cynthia and her husband, Doug, worked for Ensign. After he fired them in 2008, while the affair was going on, he paid them nearly $100,000 and found lobbying work for Doug Hampton. Ensign resigned from his Senate post three weeks before an ethics report was to be released and has gone back to his life as a veterinarian in Las Vegas, where he said he has been ""humbled."" ""I used to own this practice, now I'm working for somebody. That's sometimes a very healthy thing to happen in life,"" Ensign told CNN's Dana Bash last year. As for Hampton, the Las Vegas Review Journal reported in 2011 that she filed for bankruptcy, left Las Vegas and moved to California to work for a Christian organization. But not all affairs end badly for the woman involved: . Maria Belen Chapur: She is the Argentinian woman with whom former South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford was with when he disappeared for four days in 2011. Sanford and his wife split but his political career recovered. He won election to his former House seat in 2012. And his mistress is no longer his mistress but his fiance. She spends some time in Argentina still and is a columnist for a news website in Argentina. Her last entry was from December.

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. military is updating plans to potentially evacuate U.S. Embassy personnel from Yemen in the wake of rising violence and uncertainty about the security situation in that country, CNN has learned. Any military involvement in an evacuation would come only after the U.S. ambassador requests help, something which has not yet happened. However, this week, defense and State Department officials confirmed there have been a series of conversations between the Pentagon and State Department about how long U.S. diplomats can safely stay in Yemen. ""We are poised to act if it becomes necessary to get people out,"" the defense official said. ""If you ask me do I think it's more likely now, the answer is yes."" A State Department official said there is always planning in place, ""but no decisions have been made."" ""The situation could change tomorrow or the next day, so I don't want to say we never will, but for now it is not in the cards,"" the State Department official said. A U.S. defense official with direct knowledge of the planning confirmed the details to CNN but declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. While the Pentagon has been keeping a close eye on the deteriorating security situation in Yemen for weeks, several defense officials tell CNN that in the last few days, concern has grown. Al Qaeda member killed in Yemen strike, official says . General threats . Terrorists have made general threats against the U.S. Embassy and personnel in Yemen, including the ambassador, but the United States does not have any actionable information about a specific or credible threat, State Department officials said Tuesday. Last weekend, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) claimed it planted two explosive devices at the residence of Yemen's President to target U.S. Ambassador Matthew Tueller who was expected there for a meeting, according to an online statement posted by the terror group and unearthed by SITE Intelligence Group. The explosives were discovered before detonation. But defense and State Department officials said they have no indication so far there was an attack truly aimed at the ambassador. ""There are threats against everybody,"" a senior State Department official said. ""The U.S. Embassy, the ambassador, all of our employees. But there is nothing actionable."" The State Department officials described the threats ""aspirational in nature,"" rather than a specific or credible plan to attack U.S. facilities or personnel. ""We get a lot of these threats,"" another official said. ""We look, check and decide whether there is something actionable. If there were some time to act upon we would. But there is nothing."" Embassy staff reductions . The State Department has at times this year ordered a reduction in the number of embassy personnel. One State Department official said the reduction of staff was ""marginal,"" with less than a quarter of the personnel sent to other countries in the region until the situation in Yemen improved. The ambassador is still in the country, and several dozen heavily armed Marines continue to guard the embassy. ""There is a lot of turmoil there, so we took a few people out and made adjustments -- but this is nowhere near a major reduction,"" the State Department official said. The major concern for the military is whether the violence has grown to the point that the embassy personnel cannot safely stay, and that there may be only limited ways of getting them out of Yemen. There have been clashes between rebel groups and Yemen government forces around the airport in the capital, Sanaa. Contingency plans . The updated evacuation plans could include the use of U.S. Marines and helicopters stationed on the amphibious warship USS Makin Island off the coast of Yemen. If an evacuation was ordered, and there was continued fighting around the airport in Sanaa that would make it impossible for diplomats to leave on commercial planes, the Marines could be called in, a defense official said. The defense officials who spoke with CNN acknowledge that as part of the discussions about whether and how long the diplomats can safely remain in Yemen, there is also internal discussion about the key issue of trying to keep a U.S. presence even after an evacuation that can continue to work with the Yemeni government and military on fighting AQAP, the al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen. If the United States were forced to even temporarily shutter the embassy there, its ability to monitor and conduct counterterrorism efforts would be significantly reduced, one of the defense officials said.","Al Qaeda in Arabian Peninsula said it planted devices at Yemen President's home .

"(CNN) -- Well, that didn't last long. No sooner had speculation heated up that Disney was planning a ""Frozen"" sequel, to be titled ""Strange Magic,"" than the studio sent out a news release throwing cold water all over that theory. Turns out, ""Strange Magic"" is the title of a new animated movie from Lucasfilm Ltd. "" 'Strange Magic' is a madcap fairy tale musical inspired by 'A Midsummer Night's Dream,' "" the statement says. ""Popular songs from the past six decades help tell the tale of a colorful cast of goblins, elves, fairies and imps, and their hilarious misadventures sparked by the battle over a powerful potion."" Days after just about every other child in America dressed like a character from the hit Disney film for Halloween, the Internet thought it had cracked the the case of the possible title for a ""Frozen 2."" The film has grossed so much money (more than $1 billion) and become such a fixture in pop culture that there is little doubt that there will be a follow-up. Stitch Kingdom, a Disney fan site, posted a theory tied to the recent domain name acquisitions by the studio. ""Disney today registered several domain names that in no uncertain terms point to a film title -- Strange Magic,"" the site reports. ""But the strangest bit of it all is that there appears to be little-to-no mention of it anywhere to be found on the interwebs -- at least if you're not talking about the Electric Light Orchestra (ELO) song and really, for all we know, we just might be."" The site found a link to ""Frozen"" in that the words ""strange magic"" are referenced by both the Duke of Weselton and Grand Pabbie in the movie. A TV ad for the film includes the duke saying, ""Strange magic has frozen this land."" But alas, it has nothing to do with a ""Frozen"" sequel. ""Strange Magic"" is set to be released January 23. It's not like ""Frozen"" fans won't have plenty else to keep them enthralled. Random House has announced that it will be publishing a Frozen book series targeted at young readers that will serve as a written sequel to the film. There is also ""Frozen Fever,"" a short animated sequel due out in 2015, and a Broadway musical based on the 2013 film.","NEW: ""Strange Magic"" is not a ""Frozen"" sequel, studio announces .

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Agency for International Development has paid Alan Gross $3.2 million, settling a claim over the former contractor freed last week by Cuba after five years in prison, a spokesman for the federal agency tells CNN. USAID, the agency which oversees foreign aid, said it finalized the settlement with Development Alternatives, Inc (DAI). Gross was employed by the Maryland-based company when he was arrested in 2009 trying to provide cell phones and other communications equiment to Cuba's Jewish community under a USAID program. The U.S. maintained Gross was trying to help Cubans access the Internet as part of democracy-building program in a country where information is tightly controlled. Gross was serving a 15-year sentence for trying to subvert the Cuban government, but was released last week as part of a landmark deal that paved the way for a restoration of diplomatic ties between the U.S. and Cuba after more than 50 years. In a statement released Tuesday, USAID said the settlement -- agreed to in principle in November -- calls for payment by USAID for unanticipated claims under a cost-reimbursement contract, including claims related to Gross. DAI had been seeking $7 million in costs before the Civilian Board of Contract Appeals. ""The settlement avoids the cost, delay and risks of further proceedings, and does not constitute an admission of liability by either party,"" the statement said. The USAID spokesman said as part of the settlement agreement, the agency agreed to pay Gross the $3.2 million directly. RELATED: CNN/ORC Poll: Americans side with Obama on Cuba . Gross and his wife, Judy, filed a $60 million lawsuit in November 2012 for gross negligence against the U.S. government and DAI.

"(CNN) -- Language experts weighed in Thursday after poring over the nearly 2,700 words of President Obama's Oval Office speech on the Gulf oil disaster. ""It was straightforward and easy to understand,"" said Ron Yaros, assistant professor at the Philip Merrill College of Journalism at the University of Maryland, referring to the explanations of the crisis and its possible solutions. He divided the speech into 1,200 ""idea units,"" each of which represents a point the president was trying to make. He then looked at how many of those idea units contained jargon -- unexplained terms that the average person might not recognize -- and found none in the 65 idea units that explained the problem. Of the 417 idea units that discussed what Obama planned to do, ""I found only one idea unit that probably would be potentially confusing to a nonexpert. That was the term 'relief well.' He never explained that."" BP is digging a relief well that is expected to intersect with the blown-out well in August. At that point, BP plans to pump heavy drilling fluid into the runaway well, ending the flow. ""If you look at the entire speech, and you look at the amount of jargon, it came out to 1.5 percent,"" he said. iReporter:Obama's speech too fuzzy on details . But Obama's speech may have gone over the heads of many in his audience, according to an analysis of the 18-minute talk released Wednesday by Paul J.J. Payack, president of Global Language Monitor. Tuesday night's speech from the Oval Office of the White House was written to a 9.8 grade level, said Payack, who gave Obama a ""solid B."" His Austin, Texas-based company analyzes and catalogues trends in word usage and word choice and their impact on culture. He singled out this sentence from Obama as unfortunate: ""That is why just after the rig sank, I assembled a team of our nation's best scientists and engineers to tackle this challenge -- a team led by Dr. Steven Chu, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist and our nation's secretary of energy."" ""A little less professorial, less academic and more ordinary,"" Payack recommended. ""That's the type of phraseology that makes you [appear] aloof and out of touch."" Yaros disagreed, supporting the quality of the president's explanation for spelling out the efforts under way, even if they have not succeeded in ending the flow. ""He's just trying to be transparent,"" Yaros said. ""We can't cure cancer, but I'm comforted to know that the best researchers in the nation are devoted to finding a cure."" Payack found these three sentences insensitive: ""Already, this oil spill is the worst environmental disaster America has ever faced. And unlike an earthquake or a hurricane, it is not a single event that does its damage in a matter of minutes or days. The millions of gallons of oil that have spilled into the Gulf of Mexico are more like an epidemic, one that we will be fighting for months and even years."" ""You shouldn't be saying that in Katrina-land,"" said Payack, referring to the 2005 hurricane that devastated the Gulf Coast. ""New Orleans lost a third of its population [to evacuees who did not return]; it's still recovering."" But he praised Obama's phrase ""oil began spewing"" as active and graphic. Obama's nearly 10th-grade-level rating was the highest of any of his major speeches and well above the grade 7.4 of his 2008 ""Yes, we can"" victory speech, which many consider his best effort, Payack said. ""The scores indicate that this was not Obama at his best, especially when attempting to make an emotional connection to the American people,"" he added. Though the president used slightly less than four sentences per paragraph, his 19.8 words per sentence ""added some difficulty for his target audience,"" Payack said. Mark Liberman, a linguist at the University of Pennsylvania, was unimpressed with Payack's criticism of the sentence length. ""I think we can all agree that those are shockingly long professor-style sentences for a president to be using, especially in addressing the nation after a disaster,"" Liberman wrote on his blog. ""Why, they were almost as long as the ones that President George W. Bush, that notorious pointy-headed intellectual, used in his 9/15/2005 speech to the nation about Hurricane Katrina, where I count 3,283 words in 140 sentences, for an average of 23.45 words per sentence! And we all remember how upset the press corps got about the professorial character of that speech!"" Yaros challenged the value of Payack's analysis. ""There's a tremendous amount of difference between analyzing the written word and interpreting the spoken word,"" said Yaros, a former science reporter who studies how to make complex topics understandable. Payack acknowledged Thursday in a telephone interview that his analysis is indeed based on a written version of the speech, but said that does not necessarily render it invalid. ""With the internet, probably as many people read the transcript as heard it,"" he said. ""To think it's not read and analyzed by tens of thousands of bloggers is looking at the old model."" Yaros countered that he doesn't just count words and sentences, but instead measures the audience's comprehension of news content.

Payack gives Obama ""Solid B"""
"(CNN) -- President Obama has written yet another letter to Iran's Supreme Leader and, by all accounts, his missives remain unrequited. It is not a pretty sight -- the commander-in-chief of the planet's mightiest army, the leader of the world's largest economy -- sitting down at his desk, chin in hand, trying to come up with just the right words to persuade the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to make nice with America, time and again, even after his letters prompt a combination of silence and scorn. It is good that Iran and the United States are talking. But this is another matter altogether. A letter is not needed to maintain communications. The two countries are already engaged in high-level negotiations, with a make-or-break deadline fast approaching on a nuclear deal. The sad fact is that Obama's words seem to provoke exactly the opposite of their intended reaction from Khamenei, the man who will ultimately decide if there is a nuclear deal. Khamenei has been crystal clear in expressing barely restrained contempt for Obama and his rhetorical advances. Let's face it. Obama is not a very good negotiator, at least when it comes to Iran. Obama has many strengths, but bargaining does not appear to be one of them. The fact has been evident in Washington, where he scored a few major legislative victories, but has mostly seen his agenda blocked. The blockers are Republicans and they surely bear much of the blame, but, as many have pointed out, other presidents have proven more effective at negotiating with the opposition. After watching Obama's first press conference after the midterm election, Bloomberg View's Megan McArdle wondered if Obama even knows how to negotiate. That is a scary question to ponder when the United States is on the verge of cutting a deal aimed at preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons, when United Nations nuclear inspectors say Iran is refusing to answer questions about ""possible military dimensions"" of its nuclear program, and as the United States and the so-called P5+1 negotiating with Iran steadily reduce their demands on Iran's nuclear enrichment. As Obama has said repeatedly, a bad deal with Iran is worse than no deal at all. The question is whether Obama's negotiating missteps are just that, missteps that can be corrected by crafty negotiators, or signs that he is so eager for a deal that he will lower the bar on what he considers as an acceptable agreement. Obama has focused on repairing relations with Iran since he was a presidential candidate, making all the statements and gestures that should have warmed Tehran to a new future in an Obama presidency, if Iran had had any interest at all. As a candidate he called for direct talks, and in his first inaugural speech he famously declared ""We will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist."" Then, just after taking office, he went to Cairo and gave his conciliatory speech to the ""Muslim world,"" vowing a new era in ties. Khamenei's reaction should have been enough to have Obama cross out the Supreme Leader from his list of pen pals. ""Beautiful speeches,"" Khamenei declared, ""cannot change the fact that Muslims...hate America from the bottom of their hearts."" A few months later, when Iranians took to the streets and were brutally suppressed, Obama, who had just issued another conciliatory gesture, initially refrained from airing criticism. The Ayatollah later excoriated the American President, blaming the pro-democracy protests on American and ""Zionist"" plots, not on discontent with the regime and its version of theocratic democracy. And yet, the missives from Obama kept coming. And still they traveled in just one direction. Maybe the President should have sent a self-addressed stamped envelope. At least then the disdain might have remained private. The problem is worse than an epistolary cold shoulder. Every letter from Obama seems to contain a concession that goes unreciprocated. Iran came to the table as the result of stern economic sanctions steadily enforced by Obama, and he deserves full credit for that. But it's not clear whether his personal interventions have helped the cause. Amid reports that the West is already proposing to allow Iran a level of nuclear enrichment that would have been unthinkable in the recent past, the most recent letter crossed another line, reportedly suggesting a linkage between a nuclear agreement and cooperation between Washington and Tehran in fighting the Islamic State, also known as ISIS. Obama denied there is a link, without commenting on the letter. When thinking about ISIS, Syria and Iran, we should remember that even though ISIS is viewed as a threat by both Washington and Tehran, Iran's goal is to fortify Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. The United States and Iran share their enmity with ISIS, but their larger goals are in conflict. And that's just on Syria. Iran is viewed as a threat by America's allies in the Arab world, not to mention by Israel, which it continues to goad and threaten. In apparent response to last month's letter, Khamenei's website carried an article saying Iran does not need U.S. help fighting ISIS. The United States has not done very well in the fight, it said, whereas Iraq, with Iranian help, is scoring victories against ISIS. The timing of Obama's new letter is disconcerting, to say the least. The recent drop in oil prices has put Iran in a serious bind. This could be a moment of strength for American and European negotiators, a moment to show just how much Iran has to lose by insisting on maintaining significant portions of a nuclear program that America, Europe and many Arab countries believe was developed for the purpose of building nuclear weapons. Washington already gave up the objective of seeing the nuclear program dismantled. The question now is how many months away from a bomb Iran would agree to stand in exchange for a lifting of sanctions. Iran has played an expert game. Khamenei's ability to nix any deal he does not like looms constantly over the talks, strengthening Iran's hand. The America leader, on the other hand, could use some help.","President Obama has written another letter to Iran's Supreme Leader .

"(CNN) -- If the confirmation process for Loretta Lynch, President Obama's nominee for attorney general, gets significantly delayed, the reason will be pure politics. Some Senate Republicans, anticipating the day in January when they will have majority control of the chamber, are calling for a moratorium on new appointments until the new Senate is seated. It's likely to be the first in a series of skirmishes between Obama and the leadership on Capitol Hill. Within hours of Lynch's nomination, the right-wing Breitbart website ran an erroneous story slamming Lynch for supposedly representing ex-President Bill Clinton during the long-ago inquiry into the Whitewater land deal -- but later had to post a correction for failing to recognize that Clinton's defender was, in fact, a different person named Loretta Lynch. The haste with which conservatives began attacking Lynch suggests she will be in for a tough slog during the nomination process. But while the politics may slow her confirmation, there's no question that the tough-as-nails prosecutor is ready for the top job at the Justice Department. Any rival candidates the Republicans might put forward will have a hard time demonstrating prowess equal or superior to Lynch's in the crucial areas of prosecuting lawbreakers involved in organized crime, corporate theft, political corruption and threats to national security. Lynch served two stints as the U.S. attorney in charge of New York's Eastern District, which includes most of New York City (Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island) as well as suburban Long Island. The office is often overshadowed by the neighboring Southern District, which covers Manhattan and brings high-profile Wall Street prosecutions. While her flashier colleague in the Southern District, Preet Bharara, gives speeches, holds frequent press conferences and has several press officers, Lynch rarely holds forth in public and reportedly spent months without a press aide after the sole staffer in charge of public outreach retired. But Lynch did much to put the Eastern District on the map. She mounted successful prosecutions that broke the back of MS-13, a murderous gang that preys on immigrant communities; convicted the underboss of the Colombo crime family; and even revived an old Mafia case by arresting five aging suspects from the all-but-forgotten Lufthansa heist of 1978, immortalized in the movie ""Goodfellas."" Wall Street physically falls outside Lynch's jurisdiction, but she mounted major cases against global financial giants engaged in wrongdoing. In 2012, she won a record $1.9 billion in fines and penalties from HSBC, a British bank, for a wide range of violations, including laundering more than $800 million for Mexican drug gangs and illegally doing business with customers in Iran, Sudan and Cuba. Lynch's office also participated in the pursuit of Citigroup for its actions that contributed to the mortgage crash of 2008 -- an investigation that led to a $7 billion settlement. And Lynch has taken on public corruption cases involving members of New York's power elite. She convicted Pedro Espada Jr., the former majority leader of the New York state Senate, on corruption charges, calling him ""a thief in a suit"" the day he was hauled off to serve a five-year prison sentence. She is currently prosecuting state Sen. John Sampson, and earlier this year indicted U.S. Rep. Michael Grimm on 20 counts including fraud, embezzlement and perjury. But Lynch's best-known attack on public corruption came more than a decade ago, when she was part of the team that prosecuted cops who attacked and brutally sodomized a suspect, Abner Louima, in the back room of a Brooklyn precinct house. The prosecution ended in a guilty plea by the main perpetrator, Officer Justin Volpe, who is serving a 30-year sentence. In addition to rounding up shady pols, violent cops and Wall Street cheats, Lynch took on the all-important issue of national security in the harrowing case of Najibullah Zazi, a terrorist who drove explosives from Colorado to New York City with the intent of setting them off in the subways. Zazi almost pulled off the horrific attack -- he was stopped on the George Washington Bridge, minutes from Manhattan -- but ended up pleading guilty and cooperating with the government. (He hasn't been sentenced yet, but faces up to two life sentences for his crimes.) All in all, an impressive body of work -- one that Lynch compiled with a professional modesty that is rare in New York's tough, competitive legal and political circles. She will now find herself caricatured and criticized by power brokers in Washington who are determined to hamstring the president. One likely avenue of attack is Lynch's time in the private sector: Between 2001 and 2009, she worked as a corporate attorney specializing in compliance work for big banks and briefly served on the board of the New York Federal Reserve Bank. ""She swims in the same pool as the moneyed elite, and her actions don't pressure them too deeply,"" writes David Dayen in Salon, echoing the oft-heard complaint that even multibillion-dollar settlements of the kind Lynch negotiated rarely result in any specific person going to prison. ""It's just not that likely Lynch would have the will to crack down on malfeasance in the executive suites, which could implicate her colleagues and friends,"" writes Dayen. ""It's not corruption, more like mindshare."" That sort of criticism unites left-of-center Occupy Wall Street activists and conservatives who -- determined to find fault with anything Obama does -- accuse the White House of crony capitalism and aim special venom at ex-Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner (whose rise to his pre-Treasury job of president of the New York Federal Reserve was aided by Lynch; as a board member, she cast a vote to give Geithner the post). So Obama's nominee is in for a wave of criticism that might drag confirmation proceedings into 2015. We shall see if Lynch -- who has locked up enough terrorists, gangsters and political crooks to fill a few subway cars -- has the grit and gumption to master political combat inside the Beltway the way she has mastered legal battle in the courtroom.","Errol Louis: AG nominee Loretta Lynch faces political hurdles on way to confirmation .

"Washington (CNN) -- High-profile diplomatic incidents involving President Ronald Reagan and top world leaders were publicized for the first time Saturday after historian William Doyle got the White House to release the tapes. From discussing troop withdrawals with Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to discussing tense hostage negotiations with Pakistani President Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, Reagan recorded dozens of calls he made from the White House Situation Room. The audio recordings were first published in the New York Post in a story Saturday. The recordings became public after Doyle said he asked for them via a Freedom of Information Act request -- in 1996. One recording with Begin during the 1982 Lebanon War reveals that Reagan asked the Israeli Prime Minister to delay the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Lebanon until Lebanese government forces arrived. ""It's a call that I have resisted making and did not want to make and I know what has been taking place there,"" Reagan tells Begin in 1983. ""And so, here I am now asking you the one thing you told me not to ask you and that is, could you delay a few more days in that withdrawal until the Lebanese army can free itself from Beirut?"" Begin faced heavy political pressure during the Lebanese conflict and would resign just months after his call with Reagan. In a conversation with Pakistan's Zia-ul-Haq, Reagan discusses the sensitive nature of hostage negotiations after a Trans World Airlines flight from Cairo was hijacked by radical Islamists. One recording also reveals that Reagan made Syrian President Hafez el-Assad, the father of President Bashar el-Assad, wait for more than 13 minutes while he returned from horseback riding on his ranch in California. The recordings Doyle shared with the Post also included a conversation with then-British Prime Minister and conservative ally Margaret Thatcher, when Reagan apparently apologized for sending Navy SEALs into Grenada without giving Thatcher a heads up, the Post reported.","Historian William Doyle first requested the recordings in 1996 .

"(CNN) -- There's another casting rumor going around about ""Suicide Squad,"" and this one is a doozy. According to Latino-Review, Viola Davis is said to be in negotiations to land the role of Amanda Waller in the upcoming movie, which is based on the DC Comics series. Studio Warner Bros. Pictures, which shares a parent company with CNN, has already announced some of ""Suicide Squad's"" cast. Jared Leto will play the Joker, Will Smith will portray Deadshot, and Margot Robbie has been cast as the Joker's girlfriend, Harley Quinn. Jared Leto is Joker, Will Smith is Deadshot in 'Suicide Squad' One lingering casting announcement is that of Waller, the government agent who heads up ""Suicide Squad's"" team of villainous antiheroes. Davis has long been thought of as a contender for the role, along with Oprah Winfrey and Octavia Spencer. Should Davis be made an official member of the cast, she'll have to clear room in an already packed schedule. In addition to appearing in two dramatic films slated for release in 2015, she's also now the star of ABC's hit drama ""How To Get Away with Murder"" -- a show that's given Davis the kind of meaty leading role she'd been waiting for. ""I have been given a lot of roles that are downtrodden, mammy-ish,"" Davis told The New York Times' Magazine in September. ""A lot of lawyers or doctors who have names but absolutely no lives. You're going to get your three or four scenes, you're not going to be able to show what you can do. You're going to get your little bitty paycheck, and then you're going to be hungry for your next role, which is going to be absolutely the same. That's the truth."" If nothing else, playing Amanda Waller would definitely be a change of pace. In addition to Leto, Smith and Robbie, ""Suicide Squad"" also stars Tom Hardy as Rick Flagg, Jai Courtney as Boomerang and Cara Delevingne as Enchantress. The movie's scheduled to arrive in theaters on August 5, 2016.","Viola Davis might be cast as Amanda Waller .

"(CNN) -- Concerns about the Ebola virus were heightened Sunday when a health care worker in Texas had a positive preliminary test for the disease. If confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the worker's case would mark the first known transmission of Ebola in the United States and the second-ever diagnosis in the country. With developments pouring in from all corners of the world, here's what you need to know to quickly get caught up: . WEST AFRICA . No relief in sight: . The number of deaths attributed to the current Ebola outbreak has climbed to 4,033, the World Health Organization reported Friday. The tally brings the total number of confirmed, probable and suspected cases of Ebola to 8,399. The numbers were reported from Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Spain and the United States. A possible $32 billion hit: . The outbreak could cost the African economy $32 billion over the next two years if it spreads to its larger neighbors, the World Bank estimates. The steps some countries have taken to prevent the spread of the Ebola virus amount to ""putting a towel under the door of a building on fire,"" World Bank president Jim Kim told CNN's Richard Quest on Thursday. Complete coverage on Ebola . Liberia postpones election: . Liberia's President on Thursday postponed a senatorial election that had been set for this week, citing the Ebola outbreak in the country. The nation's election commission had recommended the delay, saying the prevalence of the virus, authorities' efforts to combat it and citizens' efforts to isolate themselves weren't conducive to a free and open election. Officials have not yet revealed any new date for the election, which had been set for Tuesday. U.S. troops arrive in Liberia: . A group of 90 U.S. Marines and airmen arrived in Liberia on Thursday to help Ebola response efforts, along with four V-22 Osprey aircraft and two C-130 transport planes. Their arrival brings the total number of U.S. troops deployed in Liberia to 334, military spokesman Lt. Col. Dave Doherty said. There are more coming. In late October, 700 troops from the 101st Airborne Division are scheduled to deploy to Liberia. U.S. troops battle invisible enemy in Liberia . U.S. CASES . New case in Texas: . A person who helped to treat Thomas Eric Duncan may be the first person to contract the disease while in the United States. The health care worker from Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital tested positive in a preliminary test Saturday after reporting a low-grade fever Friday. The CDC is working to confirm the diagnosis. 'Modest improvement' for NBC cameraman: . The family of NBC cameraman Ashoka Mukpo, who contracted Ebola while working in Liberia, is cautiously optimistic after doctors said his condition at a Nebraska hospital has improved slightly. Mukpo, an American citizen, has shown ""very modest improvement,"" according to The Nebraska Medical Center, where he is being treated. Mukpo is receiving an experimental drug called brincidofovir, or CMX001. ""Mr. Mukpo's condition is slightly improved,"" medical director Dr. Phil Smith said. ""He's been taking in some fluids and drinking Gatorade. But everyone needs to be reminded that this is still a very serious illness we're dealing with and no one has a lot of experience treating it."" Thomas Duncan dies: . Thomas Eric Duncan, the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States, died Wednesday, 10 days after he was admitted to Dallas' Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. His family wonders whether the outcome would have been different if doctors had admitted him to a hospital on September 25, the first time he showed up with a fever and stomach pain. Duncan's family has criticized the care he received. The Dallas hospital that treated him says staff members did everything they could. Ebola test negative for Dallas deputy: . An Ebola test was negative for a Dallas deputy who was hospitalized with possible symptoms of the deadly virus, officials said. The deputy, Sgt. Michael Monnig, didn't have any direct contact with Duncan but had reported contact with Duncan's family. Physicians at Texas Health Presbyterian discharged him Thursday, soon after the negative test came back, hospital spokeswoman Candace White said. New travel screening: . Five of America's biggest, busiest airports are beefing up measures. On Saturday, people arriving from the three nations hardest hit by Ebola started getting special screening, including having their temperature taken, at New York's JFK airport. Washington's Dulles, Newark, Chicago's O'Hare and Atlanta international airports will begin screening Thursday. Ebola worries spread: . In New York, fire officials said a patient in Brooklyn with Ebola-like symptoms had recently returned from the North African country of Sudan, the New York Daily News reported. The patient was undergoing tests, but the New York Health Department said there were no patients in the city suspected of having Ebola. The patient was ""never at risk for Ebola and never met the definition of an Ebola suspect,"" the Health Department said. Sudan is far removed from the West African center of the outbreak -- as far away from it as Atlanta is from Los Angeles. Still, fear of the often deadly disease has bred much caution. ""I have seen several people who had acute illnesses worried that they may have Ebola,"" said Dr. Mark Reiter, an emergency room physician in Tennessee and president of the American Academy of Emergency Medicine. Reiter said many patients in his state are unlikely candidates, not having been to West Africa, nor having had any contact with a symptomatic Ebola patient. ""But it has gotten a tremendous amount of media coverage and some people are especially concerned about it, even if it is highly unlikely,"" Reiter said. In Los Angeles, a patient who was isolated at Centinela Hospital's emergency room after being transported from Los Angeles International Airport earlier this week has undergone all necessary tests required by the CDC and Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. The patient was approved for discharge. Linda Bradley, hospital CEO, said the patient, who had traveled recently from Liberia, underwent numerous tests, which came back negative. Cuban doctors train, then fight Ebola in Africa . IN OTHER COUNTRIES . Spain Ebola patient has no significant change in condition: . Teresa Romero Ramos, a nurse's assistant in Spain who is the first person to contract Ebola outside Africa, ""is conscious and talking"" but was in ""stable but serious"" condition Saturday after taking a turn for the worse earlier in the week. She has been treated with the anti-influenza drug Avigan, hospital sources with knowledge of the case said. Spain ramps up response: . After Romero became the first person to contract Ebola outside Africa, 16 people related to the case were being monitored in a Madrid hospital, including an emergency room doctor, the neighborhood doctor who saw her before the case was confirmed, and the nurse's husband, according to a government source. A special committee created by the Spanish government to tackle the Ebola crisis reported no significant changes in her condition. The committee, which will include representatives from government and health care, will coordinate national efforts to control the virus and establish protocols to deal with it, the source said. A nurse under observation at the hospital tested negative for the Ebola virus, the committee said. The nurse has been discharged but will remain under observation outside the hospital until her quarantine ends on October 16, the committee said. Sporadic infections unavoidable, the WHO says: . Sporadic Ebola infections will be unavoidable in some European countries because of direct travel from their hubs to hotspot areas in West Africa, the World Health Organization said Wednesday. But the risk of spread, it said, is avoidable and extremely low. Australia scare: . A 57-year-old woman who returned to Australia after treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone has been isolated at a hospital and is undergoing tests, including one for the deadly virus, authorities said. She had isolated herself at home and checked her temperature twice daily since her return, as recommended by national guidelines. The Queensland Department of Health announced early Friday that initial tests on the woman came back negative for Ebola. United Kingdom: . The UK's Heathrow and Gatwick airports and Eurostar railway terminals will begin screening passengers arriving from Ebola-affected Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, a government spokesman said. Screening will involve assessing passengers' recent travel history, who they have been in contact with and future travel arrangements, as well as a possible assessment performed by medical personnel. CNN's Steve Almasy, Joe Sutton, Ray Sanchez, Greg Botelho, Alexander Felton, Khushbu Shah, Saskya Vandoorne, Richard Quest, Brent Swails and Nima Elbagir contributed to this report.","NEW: Texas health worker reports fever Friday, preliminary positive test for Ebola on Saturday .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Thirty years ago, on March 26, 1979, three couples sat down for a celebratory lunch in the White House. Jehan Sadat remembers the joy she felt when the Camp David Accords brought peace between Egypt and Israel. President Jimmy Carter and first lady Rosalynn Carter, Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and his wife Aliza, and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and his wife Jehan, talked privately before greeting the hundreds of people who witnessed the signing of the historic peace treaty between Egypt and Israel that day. Jehan Sadat remembers crying with joy that day at seeing Israelis and Egyptians putting aside their differences and talking simply as people. Sadat and Begin shared the 1978 Nobel Peace Prize for the treaty they negotiated under the auspices of President Carter. Her happiness was shattered October 6, 1981, when Anwar Sadat was gunned down while reviewing a military parade. Jehan and Anwar Sadat had been married for 32 years. The daughter of a British teacher and an Egyptian government official, she met the former Army officer at her cousin's house, not long after he had been released from prison for opposing Britain's occupation of Egypt. She was 15 and he was almost 30, but they fell in love and married soon after. In her new book, ""My Hope for Peace,"" Jehan Sadat says she was crushed by her husband's death and at first almost immobilized. But she eventually decided to continue her work outside the home. Today she splits her time between homes in Egypt and in Virginia and seeks to continue her husband's work for peace while finding time for her grandchildren and for gardening. A teacher who earned a Ph.D. in comparative literature, she is a senior fellow with the Anwar Sadat Chair for Peace and Development at the University of Maryland. Jehan Sadat spoke with CNN.com Wednesday. Here are excerpts from that conversation: . CNN: One of the things you do in the book is to attempt to correct the misconceptions that most Americans have about Islam. What do you think is the biggest myth that people have about Islam? Sadat: I noticed right after 9/11 that the people were not understanding the Muslims and Islam as a religion. They were confused between terrorists doing something and Islam. Islam has nothing to do with violence, has nothing to do with revenge or things like that. Islam is a religion for peace, for love, for tolerance. But I understand why people think that way. My husband was killed by fanatics. But these fanatics, I believe, they are not Muslims, they don't belong to any religion because no religion tells you to kill, including Islam, of course. It does not tell you to kill. It does not tell you to commit suicide. CNN: What's your impression of Barack Obama? Sadat: I am thrilled and happy, I can't tell you. I was following his campaign. First of all I feel he has so many things in common with my husband, he has ... the same smile, the same devotion to their country, the same charisma, the same love for the people. Both were devoted to their countries very much and wanted to do something for their people ... I have hope, to tell you the truth, that President Obama will help in bringing peace in the Middle East, which will calm the terrorists down. CNN: What impact do you think the Gaza violence and the recent Israeli election are going to have on the prospects for peace? Sadat: I am very optimistic that what my husband did, what he gave his life for will never, ever go in vain. I believe, though I'm not young, that I will see peace prevailing in the Middle East between the Arabs and the Israelis, and I am a very realistic woman. I am not living in fantasy or illusion. When Sadat started making peace with Israel ... people couldn't believe it. They said it will never happen, but it did happen and my husband made it. And that's why I feel it will happen in our time. The Palestinians want peace. The Israelis want peace. I want to see them living side-by-side in a very peaceful atmosphere. The problem is not with the people, the problem is with the leaders. And I hope [incoming Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu this time will do like President [Menachem] Begin did. Begin was Likud and he was not an easy man, but he was a leader and he did make peace with Egypt, with Sadat and with the help of President Carter. CNN: What's the current relationship between Israel and Egypt? Sadat: It's not bad at all, it's good, but I wish it would be even more intimate. But what affects the relationship between Egypt and Israel is the aggression of the Israeli people in Gaza ... the Palestinians are wrong to send rockets. They should sit and negotiate like Sadat and Begin did ... But the revenge of Israel is so harsh, so hard on the people there, and who died? It was not the people Israel wanted to get rid of. No, it was the innocent people, women and children ... CNN: Some people are critical of Egypt for not allowing residents of Gaza to cross the border. Sadat: Well, there are rules in Egypt. We are a country that has rules and when you want to cross the border there are rules to be followed. Of course I can also understand, they were suffering a lot, that's why they crossed in thousands and thousands to the border of Egypt ... CNN: You mentioned in the book that when your husband was assassinated, you were in the reviewing stand. How far away were you? Sadat: I was just a few meters behind him ... my guard pushed me to the ground, that's what saved me really. And I was terrified and shocked ... CNN: You wrote about how this was a very crushing blow and you had a hard time adjusting. Sadat: You know we were not only wife and husband, we were two partners loving each other, respecting each other, trying to do something together for our country. When he was assassinated, it was like you took away half of me. It was not that easy, but thank God I got over it after a while and instead of staying at home and doing nothing and just having grief, I went out and continued my teaching. I went to the United States, I taught in four universities ... and now I am settled with the University of Maryland, and there is a chair there named for my husband for development and peace. I am filling my life and continuing his work for peace with dignity, with honor and justice. CNN: March 26 is the 30th anniversary of the formal signing of the Camp David Accords. Were you at the White House for the signing that day? Sadat: Of course, I was there, I was with my family and with my children. It was unforgettable to see the Israeli delegation and the Egyptian delegation and the American delegation and instead of enemies they were friends, talking and chatting. It was something that I would never ever forget. My tears were coming down, I could hardly control them, because I was so happy to see that we are all like one family. And that's why I am dying to see peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians and the Syrians and the Lebanese so we can live as one family and concentrate on our problems. We have so many problems in our countries to solve, we have to raise the standard of the people, we have poverty, we have illiteracy. Let us concentrate on this, not concentrate on waging war.","Thirty years after the Camp David accords, Anwar Sadat's widow hopes for peace .

"(CNN) -- Pope Francis has made clear that ""wealth and income inequality is a moral issue"" that needs addressing as a priority. Expect President Barack Obama to address that theme strongly during his State of the Union address Tuesday -- but for very different political reasons. Barack Obama will make economic inequality central to his 2014 agenda in his State of the Union address on Tuesday night. The president's speech will be watched intensely not just in the United States, but right across the world. This is because, right now, inequality is a very salient issue internationally. And, interestingly, it is not just politicians, but also other prominent figures (including, most notably, Pope Francis) who are championing this agenda. Less than a year into his papacy, Francis has already criticized what he sees as modern society's ""idolatry of money."" He has clearly stated that ""wealth and income inequality is a moral issue"" that needs addressing as a priority. And in a sign that Obama recognizes the growing international momentum behind this issue, the White House last week announced that the president will travel to the Vatican in late March. The talks will center around the ""shared commitment [of the Pope and President] to fighting global poverty and growing inequality."" Obama's State of the Union address, and his March meeting with the Pope, will not just bring global attention to this agenda. It will also encourage campaigning on similar themes by politicians around the world, especially from the left of center. To date, mainstream left parties in many countries have failed to capitalize electorally, particularly in Europe, on the last few years of economic downturn that has been the most acute period of crisis since at least the 1930s. But, the fortunes of the center left could yet be on the turn. In Europe, for instance, UK Labour Party Leader Ed Miliband hopes to win office next year on a platform of voter discontent in the country over stagnant living standards. Meanwhile, Canada's Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau is championing a narrative of the struggling middle class in advance of the 2015 ballot in that country. And, in New Zealand, Labour Party Leader David Cunliffe hopes to seize power by exploiting economic inequality issues in an election expected this year. Meanwhile, in the United States, the White House calculates that a core economic fairness agenda has the potential to reboot Obama's flailing second term of office, and prove a winning national theme for the Democratic Party in November's mid-term congressional elections. To this end, Obama plans to use his address to build popular support, and also press for specific proposals to address income inequality, including extending jobless-benefits, and expanding the federal minimum wage to at least $10. Professor Johannes Lindvall's fascinating research on the political consequences of the Great Depression, and the post 2008/09 Great Recession, is potentially illuminating about the left of center's political prospects in coming years. He has shown that the electoral implications of both of these defining historical moments were similar to begin with: conservative parties generally performed stronger in ballots than the mainstream left soon after both economic crises began. As Lindvall asserts, this could be potentially explained, in part, by the fact that the initial trauma of both the Great Depression and Great Recession were widely perceived as so significant that many middle class voters cast their lot in with conservative parties which were seen as better able to tackle the crisis. In the two years after 2008/09 alone, for instance, center-left parties lost ground, or were jolted by significant electoral losses in countries in Asia-Pacific (Australia and New Zealand), to Europe (Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, the United Kingdom) and North America (in the 2010 U.S. mid-term elections). What is potentially even more interesting, however, is that Lindvall found that once the Great Depression was no longer seen by voters as a major continuing threat, the political pendulum tended to swing back toward parties of the center left. Of course, it is by no means certain that history will repeat itself. Lindvall, for instance, notes that politicians of the mainstream left today have less new agenda setting ideas and policy options than in the 1930s when an era of expansionary fiscal policies and welfare programmes blossomed. Nonetheless, the longer the legacy of the 2008/09 crisis continues to bite, from higher youth unemployment to stagnant living standards, the greater the opportunities could be for the centre left to benefit. Now as in the 1930s, economic hardship is being felt in many countries not just by the poor, but also the middle classes. And, it is this discontent that left-of-center politicians, including Obama, Miliband, Trudeau, and Cunliffe, are seeking to tap into.

"(CNN) -- Finally. Finally. Finally, a strong important voice in the world, the United Nations, speaks out on behalf of the rights of children and condemns the Vatican and the bishops for crimes of violence, rape and sexual abuse against children by transferring pedophile priests from parish to parish, withholding documents for prosecution and perpetuating an institutional culture of secrecy and shame. What's truly shameful is that the Catholic Church was not itself that strong and important voice, protecting ""the least of these."" It's shameful that in spite of Pope Francis' refreshing compassion toward the poor and downtrodden, to date he has not addressed the issue fully. Pope Francis is caught up in the shame and like most of his brother bishops, seems unwilling to say, ""Enough is enough -- not ever again in our church will one of these little children be harmed."" The media have said the church is suffering from a ""code of secrecy."" Kirsten Sandberg, the chairwoman of the United Nations, put it this way: ""We think it is a horrible thing that is being kept silent both by the Holy See itself and in local parishes. "" As a survivor of rape and violence at the hands of a priest when I was a young girl, I understand that secrecy. I went silent at age 7 and became a part of the secret code that no one could unlock in me, because there were always pieces missing. For the rest of my childhood I really wasn't there. I split and left a part of me behind in shame and secrecy. It has taken me more than half a lifetime to piece myself back together. I was 52 years old and still captivated by the Catholic Church when I let the buried ""secret"" memories emerge. His name was Father Rucker -- George Neville Rucker. I must have trusted him when he asked me to crawl up on his lap as he sat watching a movie in an auditorium so long ago. He raped me while my mother was in the lunchroom nearby. The tragedy here -- among others -- is that Mom died before I was strong enough to tell her about that terrible day. We missed out on conversations about intimacy and love because I would always shut down and disconnect. Rape robbed me and my family of so much that mattered -- like truth and honesty between us. After high school at age 18, I entered the convent of the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary in Santa Barbara, California, and remained there as a nun for 15 years. Detaching from the destructive invasion of Father Rucker into my body and soul allowed me to hold onto God and to the sisters I loved. Very simply, that is how I was able over half a lifetime to remain in the Catholic Church until the day I awakened to the tragedy of the little girl whom I once was. The Archdiocese of Los Angeles released 12,000 pages of files on scores of priests accused of sexually abusing children in 2013. I found out that the pastor of our parish back in 1947 suspected Father Rucker of ""touching"" little girls. It was the bishop who would not listen and passed Father Rucker on and on until 2002, when he was defrocked. He had become a real liability to Cardinal Roger Mahony, head of the archdiocese. About 33 women accused him of abusing them when they were young. That's five decades of abuse. In 2002, he was charged with 29 counts of molesting girls. He was taken off a cruise ship on its way to Russia to face the charges; authorities thought he was trying to flee. But his case was dismissed in 2003 after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that the charges were too old. It is easy to think that when we talk about the crisis of child rape and abuse that we are talking about the past -- and the Catholic Church would have us believe that this most tragic era in church history is over. It is not. It lives on today. Pedophiles are still in the priesthood. Coverups of their crimes are happening now, and bishops in many cases are continuing to refuse to turn information over to the criminal justice system. Cases are stalled and cannot go forward because the church has such power to stop them. Children are still being harmed and victims cannot heal. These criminal acts happened over and over to tens of thousands of children in the past, continue now and will continue until Pope Francis and the bishops act fiercely to insist that children and their safety come first, and that priests and protecting the image and power of the Catholic Church come a distant second. Pope Francis must take action and mandate every bishop to immediately defrock any priest who has sexually abused children in the past or in the present and let the civil authorities investigate any priest or bishop alleged to have sexually abused a child. It's common sense. Nothing else will show the world that the Catholic Church is serious about its promise to address this issue. Pope Francis will need to begin at home and release whatever records the Vatican possesses on priests and bishops accused of these crimes, wherever they are in the world. Anything short of this speaks of lip service and platitudes. Francis also needs to chastise and demote bishops guilty of protecting priest abusers and working against the criminal justice system -- not honor and promote them. Cardinal Mahony was recently honored in celebrating Mass with Pope Francis -- and yet it is documented that he withheld information and transferred priests within and outside his diocese. At least Mahony acknowledged in a statement in 2013 that he had been ""naive"" about the lasting impacts of abuse and then met with 90 victims. But Pope Francis' speeches and actions to date do not reflect a spirit of compassion for, or understanding of, the impact on survivors. Any positive changes in the Catholic Church to protect children and hold the church accountable have come about largely because of the tireless work of SNAP, Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests. These are brave and courageous men and women who tell their stories of abuse without shame. We can also thank the Catholic community of laypeople who want their children to be safe and their church to become the church it can be: a beacon of hope for its members and the world. Now, it's the Vatican that must take action, as the U.N. report urges, to show us that its apologies are matched by actions to both stop the abuse of children and the church's coverup. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mary Dispenza.","Mary Dispenza: Finally, the U.N. condemned the Vatican for its negligence in priest abuse cases .

"Washington (CNN) -- Former President George W. Bush said Tuesday that he wanted to publish his personal biography about his father, former President George H.W. Bush, now because ""I wanted Dad to be alive -- to be able to see how much not only I care for him but a lot of people care for him."" ""His presidency in many ways was overshadowed by his predecessor, and that's understandable,"" Bush said. ""[But] people are beginning to reassess the presidency of 41 and I want to be a part of that process and I wanted him to know that that process was going to take place."" Bush's comments came at an event with his father Tuesday marking the launch of the 43rd president's personal biography of the 41st president. The discussion was moderated by former George W. Bush chief of staff Andy Card and held at the George H.W. Bush Presidential Library at Texas A&M University in College Station. It was a heartfelt tribute to the elder Bush, who left the White House 22 years ago and is now 90. At 90, Bush 41 'enjoys life to the fullest' The younger Bush called ""41: A Portrait of My Father,"" ""a pretty good read"" about the man he said is the best one-term president in U.S. history. He said the inspiration came from a conversation with the daughter of renowned presidential biographer David McCullough, who told him that her father had always wished he could have read a book by John Quincy Adams about his father, John Adams. Bush said he thought: ""Well, I can do that."" During the 45-minute event, the younger Bush told a number of stories about his father -- some funny and some touching. He said his father thinks about the men he served with when he was a pilot during World War II -- including radio man John Delaney and gunner Ted White, who died when their plane was shot down. The elder Bush was the only survivor. Bush said he didn't know until he started researching for the book that his father had invited the sisters of Delaney and White to visit him in the Oval Office. ""That's one of the most difficult aspects of the presidency is to be the comforter-in-chief, and I learned at the knee of the master,"" he said. He also discussed the friendship his father developed with his 1992 rival and then successor, former President Bill Clinton. That relationship, he said, speaks to ""Bill Clinton's great respect for George H.W. Bush, and George H.W. Bush's great humility that he wouldn't allow an election to intercede a unique friendship."" And he told several humorous childhood stories -- including the young family's move from Yale University to Odessa, Texas, where they lived in a duplex and shared a bathroom with two ""ladies of the night."" He said his father once discovered that a 6-year-old George W. Bush had stolen toy soldiers from a local shop, and made him return them and apologize to the store's owner. ""It wasn't just putting them back in this little bowl that I'd taken them from,"" he said. ""It was apologizing and learning responsibility."" He said when he was 18, his parents invited him to dinner one-on-one, and it became clear that his mother had something she wanted to discuss. ""I discovered and ash tray under your bed. You smoke,"" Barbara Bush said. ""And Dad looked at her and said, 'So do you.'"" The event came amid increased focus on the Bush family as another member, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, considers a run for president -- with a decision expected late this year or early next year. Busy week under way for Bush 41 . Bush said it ""would be awesome"" if his brother Jeb runs for the White House -- and that his brother and Hillary Clinton are ""the two most qualified people in being able to tell you what it's like to be president."" ""He ought to run for president and would be a great president should he win,"" Bush said of his brother. But he said his brother is making a ""very personal decision"" about whether a presidential campaign would be right for his family, and that outside pressure isn't going to influence his decision. Also, he said, his brother is troubled by the idea of a political class. ""The idea of Bush, Clinton, Bush, Obama, Bush troubles him,"" he said. ""... I said, 'How's this sound: Bush, Clinton, Bush, Obama, Clinton?' The point is, you don't get to pick the environment in which you run.""","President George W. Bush has written a personal biography of his father, President George H.W. Bush .

"London (CNN) -- Rosetta mission controllers have made the first call to ""Go"" for an attempted landing on Comet 67P, the European Space Agency (ESA) announced in a webcast Tuesday. If it succeeds it will be the first time a spacecraft has landed on a comet. Scientists say there are still a few more key decisions to take in the coming hours before a planned separation of the landing craft Philae from the mother ship Rosetta on Wednesday. Philae, which has spent 10 years fixed to the side of Rosetta during the journey across the solar system, cannot be steered once released. Before Tuesday's announcement, ESA lander system engineer Laurence O'Rourke told CNN that the orbiter Rosetta has to be in the right position to allow the craft to ""free fall"" on the correct trajectory to the chosen landing site. Scientists are hoping the probe will help us learn a lot more about the composition of comets and how they react when they get close to the Sun. Weighing in at 220 pounds, it might be the size of a domestic washing machine but Philae is considerably smarter. It is equipped with an array of experiments to photograph and test the surface of Comet 67P as well as finding out what happens when the roasting effect of the Sun drives off gas and dust. But first it has to reach the landing site -- and there's a lot that could go wrong. O'Rourke explained that hours before separation, Philae's on-board batteries are prepared and a fly wheel is started to give the probe stability on its journey to the comet surface. Without the gyroscopic effect of the fly wheel there's a danger that the lander could turn end over end, he said. To release Philae, wax over a latch is melted and the lander is automatically unscrewed. If it fails there's a back-up plan. A pyrotechnic charge will fire and push the lander away at just the right speed to set Philae on the right course, O'Rourke said. Mission controllers then face a nervous seven-hour wait for Philae to reach the surface. The comet is so far away that a confirmation signal relayed from Rosetta, which remains in orbit around the comet, will take nearly half an hour to reach Earth. The comet's gravity is so weak that engineers have come up with ingenious solutions to keep Philae in place. At touchdown two harpoons fire out from the legs, a thruster on top of the craft helps push it to the surface and screws on each of the three feet help attach it to the comet. Built by a European consortium, led by the German Aerospace Research Institute (DLR), the landing probe has 10 instruments. If all goes well the first picture should be of the landing site taken by Philae during the final moments of descent, followed by a panoramic image from seven cameras on the top edge of the lander, O'Rourke told CNN. According to details on ESA's Rosetta website, sensors on the lander will measure the density and thermal properties of the surface, gas analyzers will help to detect and identify any complex organic chemicals that might be present, while other tests will measure the magnetic field and interaction between the comet and solar wind -- high-energy particles given off by the Sun. Philae also carries a drill that can drive 20cms (8 inches) into the comet and deliver material to its on-board ovens for testing. O'Rourke told CNN that the landing is fraught with danger. Philae could hit a boulder or a crevice and tip over. However, mission scientists are already pleased with progress. ESA project scientists Matt Taylor said: ""The orbiter will remain alongside the comet for over a year, watching it grow in activity as it approaches the Sun, getting to within 180 million kilometers (112 million miles) in summer next year, when the comet will be expelling hundreds of kilograms of material every second. ""It's got an awesome profile -- the adventure of the decade-long journey necessary to capture its prey, flying past the Earth, Mars and two asteroids on the way,"" he said. And science fiction writer Alastair Reynolds added: ""This is science fiction made real in terms of the achievement of the mission itself, but Rosetta is also taking us a step closer to answering science fiction's grandest question of all -- are we alone?"" What can we learn from comet landing? How comet mission helps search for alien life . What is a comet and what will Rosetta discover .","NEW: Scientists give first 'go-ahead' for an attempted landing on Comet 67P .

"(CNN) -- Three radio DJs in Kenya are going six days without food while broadcasting non-stop to promote peaceful voting in a country that was nearly torn apart after its last election five years ago. Ghetto Radio presenters Mbusii, Solloo and Essie have been locked inside a ""glass house"" in central Nairobi since Wednesday, as part of the station's annual Serious Request Kenya event. This year's theme is ""Vote4Peace Vote4Kenya,"" ahead of the East African country's elections on March 4 2013. The vote will be the first since ethnic violence engulfed the country after disputed elections in December 2007, leaving more than 1,000 people dead and 350,000 displaced, according to the Kenya Red Cross. Read related: Can tech revolutionize African elections? Three days into the challenge, DJ Solloo is in good spirits -- despite the lack of food. ""I'm a bit hungry,"" he laughingly admits, ""but we have to do this -- it's a pretty good feeling."" Solloo, whose real name is Solomon Njoroge, says Kenya cannot afford a return to post-election violence. Last time around, he says, he was a victim of the bloody unrest that swept his town of Eldoret, one of the fighting hotspots in Kenya's Rift Valley province. Solloo says that back then he had to spend more than two weeks with limited food supplies while camping at a police station for safety. ""This country cannot afford to go back to that time,"" says Solloo from the glass house, a few moments before going on air. ""I decided to come here because we have to push for this message to be a part of every Kenyan. It has to be every Kenyan's initiative to know that peace is more than just the absence of war."" Opinion: What Ghana can teach the rest of Africa about democracy . The radio presenters' food strike kicked off on December 19 and will run until December 24. So far, Solloo says, thousands of young people have gathered outside the glass house to show their support and also take part in a host of election-related activities, including issuing of ID cards, a voter-registration program and democracy workshops. ""The response has just been amazing,"" says the DJ, who is relying on water and juices to get through the six-day period. ""Everyone's proactive saying Kenya needs peace. We have to work for Kenya and work for peace."" Some of the country's best-known musicians have also joined the cause by performing live outside the glass house, adding their voice to a growing chorus of Kenyans calling for a peaceful election. Kenya has had a coalition government following the disputed 2007 elections. In that vote, both Mwai Kibaki, the incumbent, and challenger Raila Odinga claimed to have won. The post-election chaos escalated into ethnic violence with members of the president's tribe, the Kikuyu, fighting members of Odinga's Luo tribe and other groups. The two later entered into a power-sharing agreement, with Odinga named prime minister and Kibaki named president. Despite some pre-election tensions between politicians in the country, Solloo is hopeful that Kenya's young population will show the nation's leaders that bloodshed should be avoided at all costs. ""I just want everyone to understand that we need peace,"" he says. ""We cannot afford another post-election violence.""","Three Kenyan radio presenters are going six days without food to advocate peaceful elections .

It's not unusual for a small percentage of Americans to be undecided in the final hours before casting their votes.

"London (CNN) -- One Direction, Ed Sheeran and a host of other stars are raising money to fight Ebola with a 30th anniversary version of the Band Aid charity single first recorded in aid of famine relief in Ethiopia. Bob Geldof, one of the original Band Aid organizers, presented the song, ""Do They Know It's Christmas?"" for the first time on a TV talent show on Sunday. Geldof urged people to download the song after its release on Monday. ""We go to war. We're going to stop this thing. Buy this song,"" Geldof said. ""This isn't about me, it's not about you, it's not about them, it's about us,"" he said. ""The reason they did this is that this thing could arrive here on a plane at any time."" At a news conference last week, Geldof reflected on the cruelty of Ebola, which is killed more than 5,000 around the world, and is spread by contact with the bodily fluids of a person infected with the virus. ""Mothers can't cradle their children; lovers can't comfort each other; wives can't hold their husbands' hands while they die. That's not right. It can be stopped,"" Geldof said. He also praised the ""immensity of bravery"" of those caring for Ebola patients in West Africa, where the worst affected nations are Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, including British healthcare workers and military. Geldof: Intervene immediately on Ebola . The lineup for the 30th anniversary single combines some of those involved in the original recording in 1984 as well as fresh talent. Besides pop superstars One Direction, the artists signed up to take part include U2 frontman Bono, Coldplay's Chris Martin and Ellie Goulding. The new version of the track was recorded this weekend at the same London studios where the original was created. Some of the lyrics are updated to reflect the different circumstances of this crisis, 30 years on. The lyric ""where a kiss of love can kill you, and there's death in every tear"" replaces the former line ""where the only water flowing is the bitter sting of tears."" The much-criticized line, ""there won't be snow in Africa"" line, is changed to ""no peace and joy this Christmas in West Africa -- the only hope they'll have is being alive."" And the lyric that even Bono admitted he ""really, really loathed"" is replaced by new words.

"(CNN) -- During Tuesday night's debate with Republican challenger Mitt Romney, President Barack Obama touted his administration's support for the federal Pell Grant program and other aid for college students. The claim: . ""We've expanded Pell Grants for millions of people, including millions of young women, all across the country,"" Obama said. ""We did it by taking $60 billion that was going to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, and we said, 'Let's just cut out the middleman. Let's give the money directly to students.' And as a consequence, we've seen millions of young people be able to afford college, and that's going to make sure that young women are going to be able to compete in that marketplace."" That's a big claim in a time of tight budgets, so CNN decided to take a closer look. Fact Check: Romney, women and jobs . The facts: . In 2009 and 2010, the Obama administration pushed to eliminate the federal guaranteed student loan program, which subsidized student loans issued through private lenders. The administration argued that the money that went to banks through the program would be better spent on direct federal loans to students or to Pell Grants, which provide students up to $5,600. A Democratic-led Congress approved the plan in March 2010 as part of the same budget bill that cemented Obama's signature health care legislation. It faced heavy opposition from Republicans, who criticized it as a ""government takeover"" of the student loan industry. But Rep. George Miller, the California Democrat who led the House committee that oversaw education, argued it ended a ""sweetheart deal"" for banks. During the debate, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that the legislation would save the government up to $62 billion through 2020. Fact Check: Candidates positions on contraception? Much of that money has gone to the Pell Grant program, which has grown from about $19 billion in 2009 to a requested $36 billion for 2013. About 10 million students are expected to receive Pell Grants next year, up from about 6 million in the 2008-09 academic year, according to the Department of Education. However, observers of the higher education sector note that the grants aren't keeping up with inflated tuition. The grants now cover less than a third of the average cost of attending a four-year public college, according to the Institute for College Access & Success, a nonprofit research group. Conclusion: . Obama's comments accurately summarize the recent history of the federal student aid programs under his administration, which have gone up -- just not as fast as college costs.

"(CNN) -- McDonald's is recalling about 2.3 million Hello Kitty toys that came with some of its Happy Meals because they pose a choking risk. The item in question is a red whistle that came with the Happy Meal Hello Kitty Birthday Lollipop Toy (No. 6) -- a plastic Hello Kitty figurine holding a pink heart-shaped lollipop. The whistle can be removed from the toy and used to make sounds by inhaling and exhaling. The company received two reports of children who sucked the whistles into their mouths and coughed out pieces. One child needed medical attention, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said. McDonald's said it produced about 2.3 million of the toys, and they were distributed nationwide and in Canada with Happy Meals and Mighty Kids Meals from October through the first week of November as part of Hello Kitty's 40th anniversary celebrations. The company said Monday it has recovered 70% of the whistles, about 1.6 million. It's asking customers to ""immediately take the whistle away from children."" McDonald's stores will substitute the toy for another and give customers a yogurt tube or a bag of apple slices. ""Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our customers and this includes the toys we offer them,"" the company said.

"Ramallah, West Bank (CNN) -- Israeli troops killed a Palestinian man during clashes Tuesday in a West Bank refugee camp, the latest example of violence and tensions between the two sides. According to his family, 21-year-old Mohammed Jawabreh was standing on his home's roof watching clashes between the Israeli military and Palestinians below in the Al-Aroub refugee camp when an Israeli soldier shot him dead. An Israel Defense Forces spokeswoman said that ""a Palestinian man aimed an improvised weapon"" at troops during a violent riot by about 200 Palestinians. ""The forces immediately responded, opened fire on him, and a hit was confirmed,"" the military spokeswoman said. Israeli authorities later determined the improvised device was a homemade gun, she added. The clashes between the Palestinians and Israeli troops began at the camp's entrance on Saturday morning, according to sources inside the camp. It was not immediately clear what precipitated the latest violence. Still, tensions between Israeli authorities and Palestinians have been simmering for weeks, including violent incidents in Jerusalem as well as the Palestinian areas of Gaza and the West Bank. Iran leader's call to 'annihilate' Israel sparks fury as nuclear deadline looms . On Monday, for instance, a 20-year-old Israeli soldier was fatally stabbed in Tel Aviv. Eyewitnesses later led authorities to the suspect, an 18-year-old Palestinian man, hiding on the fourth floor of an apartment building, police spokeswoman Luba Samri said. And three Israelis were stabbed -- one fatally -- Monday at a hitchhiking post at the Alon Shvut junction in the West Bank, the same place where three Israeli teens were kidnapped and later found dead earlier this year. Those kidnappings spurred an Israeli military campaign targeting Hamas. On Saturday, Israeli police shot and killed a Palestinian man who attacked police officers with a knife in a village in northern Israel, police said. Speaking after Monday's latest violence, Israeli President Reuven Rivlin urged his countrymen to unite and ensured them that ""security forces ... will not rest until they return normality to our daily lives."" As Rivlin said, ""These are difficult days."" 2 killed, 2 wounded in stabbing attacks on Israelis . CNN's Kareem Khadder reported from Ramallah, and CNN's Greg Botelho wrote this story from Atlanta.

"(CNN) -- In 1917, at age 24, Leo Foster went from being a musician to an instrument of war. The La Crosse, Wisconsin, native isn't in any textbook. His name didn't go down in history like MacArthur or Patton. But on Veterans Day, and every day, retired U.S. Navy Capt. Gary Foster remembers his grandfather. There are no more surviving World War I veterans. They were largely remembered in the 1920s and 1930s, but after World War II, the forgetting began, said Jennifer Keene, author and Chapman University professor. As time passes, their stories become lost, except for the families that preserve their words, photographs and memories. Some relatives reach out to the American Legion, which was created by World War I veterans, to share stories in its publication, Legiontown. It was an avenue that allowed Gary Foster to first share his grandfather's story. ""The American Legion constitution includes 'to preserve the memories and incidents of our associations in the great wars,' "" said Henry Howard, editor of Legiontown. ""If we don't share these stories, they'll be gone."" Through Gary Foster and historians, a picture of his grandfather's war experience emerges, and how the lessons from the first world war still reverberate a century after it began. A world on fire . A love of music set the tone for Leo Foster's life. Along with his two sisters, Mary and Cunigunda, Leo enjoyed performing in a musical trio. And had not America joined World War I, Gary suspects that his grandfather might have continued hosting community performances. But Leo saw the writing on the wall and registered. It wouldn't be an easy decision for him. Tragedy had surrounded the Foster family early. His father, John, had died in 1895. His mother, Barbara, had lost an infant son a year earlier. And now, the man of the house would leave his family. But protecting his family was also a big motivation for Leo. ""The war in some ways was really a war for family,"" said Andrew Huebner, a University of Alabama associate professor and author. ""The public culture around the war was draped in familial metaphors, a war to defend women and children from deprivation."" The doughboys, as American troops were called, became youthful, iconic symbols for the nation. Because of exemptions from the draft, many of the men were sons, rather than fathers or husbands, Huebner said. Leo left his community for the first time to attend training camp. Camps were dangerous themselves, with the threat of disease such as the influenza epidemic, according to Keene, the Chapman University professor. After camp, shipping overseas was also hazardous, with waters infested with German U-boats keen to sink ships full of troops. Leo landed in the strange new setting of France in May 1918. He was surrounded by African, Vietnamese and Chinese troops, which would shift his view of the world. It was a hybrid army of less experienced American volunteers and conscripts melded with war-weary troops who had already endured three years of trench warfare. It was also a war of hybrid technology, Keene said. There were modern machine guns, poison gas, tanks, aircraft and submarines, but many artillery pieces were pulled into positions by horses, Keene said. Communication was key, so armies relied on sounds. A series of counteroffenses had pushed troops back toward Germany, and trenches were abandoned, rendering telephone and telegraph wires useless. Bugle calls were an old form of communication, but the archaic became necessary, Keene said. Leo's musical talent enabled him to become a bugler with the 32nd Division. Removing his gas mask, he used bugle calls for signaling advance, attack, charge and retreat as well as for mustering the troops. Leo was a main target for enemy troops. Knocking out communication in the heat of battle could further disrupt troops already shaken by the confusing fog of war. Leo's division saw heavy fighting and some of the worst battles at the end of the war. On August 1, 1918, Leo was wounded during the Aisne-Marne Offensive by shrapnel in his arms, chest and legs. Officials sent a notice to his family that Leo had been killed in action, and his grandmother raised a flag over their home, honoring his life and service. Three days later, the Red Cross arrived to say that the message had been delivered in error, and that Leo was alive. But given the severity of his injuries, his family worried that he might not survive. Leo wrote home often, brushing off the injuries and letting everyone know that he was improving. Read one of his letters (PDF) Near the end of September, Leo rejoined the fighting in time for one of the most well-remembered battles of World War I -- the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. The fighting broke through the German line and pushed back through five miles of territory. It wasn't long afterward that an armistice was declared. Leo received the Wound Chevron, gold stripes that were worn on the cuff .","As time passes, the stories of many World War I veterans have become lost .

"(CNN) -- Editor's note: CNN's Mike Rowe regularly attends an annual San Francisco ball which celebrates the birth of the U.S. Marine Corps. He wrote this essay about the event last year. The old theater looks like the one in Young Frankenstein -- the one where Gene Wilder and Peter Boyle sing ""Putting on the Ritz."" Every seat is taken, and the air is filled with a weird mix of anticipation and familiarity. And maybe a faint hint of mothballs. I'm in the mezzanine this year, sipping champagne and jammed into a tuxedo that's undeniably smaller than it was last November. Behind me, a retired general is singing The Star Spangled Banner, along with the rest of the crowd. He is singing louder than I am, and I'm singing as loud as I can. And that's saying something. The anthem ends, and we take our seats. The champagne is cold in my hand, and as I look around I see that I'm not the only one to have liberated a flute from the lobby bar. I take a sip, and observe the scene onstage. Like last year, and the year before that one, and the five years before that one, I'm transfixed by what I see. Ten Marines in full ceremonial dress march out from the wings to the sound of trumpets and drums. They move like a synchronized machine, forming two parallel lines perpendicular to the audience. They stand 10 feet apart, staring straight ahead like statues in a deadly gauntlet. They don't blink; they don't smile. They just stand there looking dangerous as hell. Then, a command is barked out. Ten swords are drawn as one, catching the light on their blades and sending it flashing through the audience like a thousand lasers. If Dr. Frankenstein's infamous creature were in the vicinity, I suspect he'd crap his pants. Upstage, the Color Guard enters, connecting the two lines at the top. They face the crowd directly - The Color Sargent and The Color Bearer, flanked by two riflemen. Under the hot lights, the Stars and Stripes are radiant, and the Marine Battle Standard glows like a crimson beacon. They've been standing there for the last half hour, frozen in time, as the events of the evening unfold. Sometimes, that's the job. To stand a post. To wait. To watch, as events unfold around you. The United States Marine Corps is 238 years old today, and last night, I helped them celebrate in San Francisco the same way I do every year. I attended their annual ball, ate a piece of their birthday cake, and assisted them with the important work of closing down the bar. In between, there was dinner and dancing and all the stuff you might expect to find at a formal ball. There were speeches and toasts. There were songs. And there were tributes of courage and sacrifice so unimaginable, you can only shake your head and marvel at the character of some. I met the oldest Marine present - 95 - and drank a beer with the youngest - 21. I swapped some jokes with a Lance Corporal that I can't repeat. (To anyone.) And I chatted with some Gold Star parents, who spoke proudly and movingly about the sons and daughters they lost. For me, the whole affair is just so damn humbling. A kid with two purple hearts and three tours of combat comes up to me and says, ""Holy cow, Mike, how did you ever do all those Dirty Jobs? What was the worst one?"" A sniper with stories that would haunt your dreams listens wide eyed as I answer his questions about crab fishing on the Bering Sea. And a combat medic who has saved more lives than he can remember wants to talk to me about his F-150. It's the same thing every year, and every year I'm surprised all over again. These Marines seem completely unimpressed with their own acts of valor. Their modesty and their courage seem to exist in parts both enormous and equal. They'd rather talk about other things. About sports. About movies. About the world in general. About the things they fight for. Anything but themselves. Which of course, makes them all the more magnificent. Really - what can you say about people like that? For now, I'll go with Happy Birthday. Maybe next year I'll come up with something more insightful. Semper Fi, Marines, and thanks. And of course, a very happy Veterans Day, to all who serve.","Mike Rowe at U.S. Marines annual ball: It's ""just so damn humbling.""

"London (CNN) -- Never mind the traffic, car owners in London have a new hazard to worry about: A skyscraper whose reflected rays have the power to melt cars. It may sound like science fiction, but it was no joke for Jaguar XJ owner Martin Lindsay, who parked his pricey ride near the under-construction building, officially called 20 Fenchurch Street, but known by many Londoners as the ""Walkie Talkie"" for its distinctive shape. Watch more: Does this skyscraper melt cars? When he returned to the car, he found some panels warped beyond repair by the beam of light reflected down from the curved side of the landmark glass tower. The developers of the 37-floor building, Canary Wharf and Land Securities, have said they'll pay for the high-spec vehicle to be fixed. ""Canary Wharf Construction and Land Securities have been very good and agreed to pay for the damage, and accept that there is an issue which they will resolve,"" Lindsay told CNN. ""I am in construction and sometimes things go wrong which nobody would have envisaged, and this is one of them."" The City A.M. newspaper said light reflected from the building had also previously damaged a van parked on the same street, Eastcheap. A joint statement from Land Securities and Canary Wharf said they were taking the issue of light reflecting from the building seriously. ""The phenomenon is caused by the current elevation of the sun in the sky. It currently lasts for approximately 2 hours per day, with initial modeling suggesting that it will be present for approximately 2-3 weeks,"" it said. The developers have been in touch with local businesses and have arranged with local authorities for three parking spaces which may be affected to be suspended, it said. ""In addition, we are consulting with local businesses and the City to address the issue in the short-term, while also evaluating longer-term solutions to ensure the issue cannot recur in future."" 20 Fenchurch Street, designed by architect Rafael ViÃ±oly, will feature about 33,000 square meters of glass -- an area equivalent to more than 4.5 soccer pitches -- once complete. It's not the only building reportedly to have directed scorching light onto the ground below. The Las Vegas Review-Journal said in 2010 that the glass-sided Vdara Hotel in Las Vegas was reflecting a ray of light so intense that it scorched the hair of a visitor using the hotel's pool, as well as melting a hole in a plastic bag he had by his sun lounger. Hotel pool employees called the phenomenon the ""Vdara death ray,"" the newspaper reported. A spokesman for the hotel's owner told the paper it was working on design solutions. CNN's Stephanie Ott contributed to this report.","NEW: Building's developers say they are taking the issue seriously .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- It was a fleeting moment, but one that Chinese censors were quick to snuff out. At an APEC event to watch the fireworks in Beijing on Monday night, Russian President Vladimir Putin created a few of his own by slipping a shawl over the shoulders of Peng Liyuan, wife of Chinese President Xi Jinping. A smiling Peng kindly accepted the offer, but seconds later deftly slipped the shawl off into the hands of a waiting aide. The small act of chivalry, quickly but politely rebuffed, unfolded live on state television, with voiceover from a CCTV anchor stating simply: ""President Putin has placed a coat on Peng Liyuan."" A hashtag based on the same words quickly gained momentum on social media where the video was posted and reposted, according to Foreign Policy. However, by morning, there was little trace of it left. Searches for the video and hashtag on China's twitter-like Weibo and messaging service WeChat turned up a smattering of comments and broken links, leaving users to surmise that China's Internet police had deemed the material too potentially damaging to share. Some remained though, including this link to the photo with the loosely translated comment: ""China's first lady's boundless charm wins over Mr. Putin."" A still image seems to show Putin glancing in Xi's direction as he draped the shawl. There's been no comment from Xi, who was sitting nearby, talking with an aide and President Barack Obama during the exchange, which has been dubbed ""coatgate"" by some media outlets. China's state news agency, Xinhua, had no reporting on the incident, nor did state television network, CCTV. It remains unclear what Putin's intentions were. Was he trying to further warm relations with Beijing? Or was there just a chill in the air? Some international media saw a whole lot more. The headline in the Sydney Morning Herald announced that Putin ""cracks on to"" the first lady. Slate said he ""flirts with"" Peng, while Foreign Policy went with ""hits on."" A president's seating arrangement hasn't attracted this much attention since Obama was seen laughing with Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt at Nelson Mandela's funeral. At least Putin didn't try to snap a selfie. That would have really sent the censors into overdrive.

"(CNN) -- Novak Djokovic's preparations for the French Open later this month have suffered a worrying setback as the world number two was forced to withdraw from this week's Madrid Open. Djokovic has suffered a recurrence of the right arm injury which hindered him at the Monte Carlo Masters three weeks ago, but was apparently healed. He is still hoping to be fit for the Rome Masters which starts next Sunday. ""I am very sorry for the Madrid tournament and all the Spanish fans to have to pull out of the Mutua Madrid Open,"" said Djokovic told the official ATP Tour website Sunday. ""I did everything possible in order to play in Madrid, which is one of the biggest events of the year, but unfortunately my right arm injury has flared up again. ""Now I will take some time to recover and heal my injury, hoping I will be ready for Rome. I look forward to returning to Madrid next year."" The Serbian won in Madrid three years ago during his triumphant 2011 season and was looking for a repeat at Caja Magica in the Spanish capital. His absence may pave the way for world number Rafael Nadal to make a successful defense of his Madrid title but he has also been far from dominant in recent weeks. Defeats to fellow Spaniards David Ferrer and Nicolas Almagro in Monte Carlo and Barcelona were unexpected, but Nadal is shrugging them off. ""I've already said it several times. I didn't try to win Monte Carlo 12 times or Barcelona 12 times. Maybe that isn't normal. This is the reality of the situation,"" he said ahead of the Madrid tournament. ""Maybe it's normal to lose three times in the quarterfinals. Maybe what's not normal is what happened during the past nine years."" Nadal beat Monte Carlo winner Stanislas Wawrinka in last year's final and believes he can go all the way again this year. ""I'm here to fight and to try to play even better,"" said Nadal. ""I don't think I have to change many things. I think I can change very small things, and the change can be quite drastic and quite big. That's what I'm working on right now. "" Meanwhile in the WTA event in Madrid, Maria Sharapova continued her superb recent form as she routed Klara Koukalova in the first round. Sharapova, who won her 30th WTA Tour title in such impressive style in Stuttgart last week, beat Koukalova 6-1 6-2. In the women's doubles tournament, Martina Hingis rolled back the years again as she paired with Germany's Sabine Lisicki to beat seventh seeds Alla Kudryavtseva and Anastasia Rodionova in a first round clash. They were a set then 4-1 down in the match tie-break before going through 3-6 6-2 10-6 victory. But there was sad news released late on Sunday, with the announcement that former top 50 WTA player and British No.1 Elena Baltacha has died aged 30. Baltacha was diagnosed with liver cancer in January, just two months after retiring from tennis and only weeks after she married her long-time coach Nino Severino. ""We are heartbroken beyond words,"" Severino said in a statement released by her family.

"Kampala, Uganda (CNN) -- Uganda has been declared free of Marburg, an Ebola-like viral hemorrhagic fever, the World Health Organization said. The declaration by the United Nations health agency comes after a 42-day surveillance period since the death of a health worker who contracted the virus. This included a period of isolation for those with whom he had come in contact. The declaration also comes as the East African nation begins hosting the 39th Africa Travel Association World Congress, which has attracted more than 400 travel and tourism companies from the United States and Europe. ""So with the WHO's procedures, two cycles of incubation period [totaling] 42 days is over then we congratulate the Ministry of Health and the government of Uganda for the wonderful job of containing it,"" declared WHO Country Representative Wondimagegnehu Alemu. However, noting that the deadly epidemic of Ebola in West Africa continues, Alemu said ""the threat is not over yet."" Uganda declared the outbreak of the second Marburg epidemic following laboratory tests confirming that one health worker, a 30-year-old male radiographer, had died of the hemorrhagic fever at a Kampala hospital on September 28. During the outbreak, 197 people -- mainly relatives of the deceased health worker and colleagues who were in contact with him -- were placed in isolation. Eight of them developed symptoms similar to Marburg, but they tested negative for the viral hemorrhagic fever. Uganda's minister for primary health care issued a warning for people to reduce contact with wild animals, especially fruit bats, and urged health workers to wear gloves and appropriate protective equipment when taking care of ill patients. Marburg virus was first identified in 1967, when 31 people became sick in Germany and Yugoslavia in an outbreak that was eventually traced back to laboratory monkeys imported from Uganda. Since then the virus has appeared sporadically, with just a dozen outbreaks on record. Many of those involved only one diagnosed case. Uganda in 2012 endured an outbreak of Marburg that killed nine of the 18 people infected, according to the Ministry of Health. Marburg virus causes symptoms similar to Ebola, beginning with fever and weakness and often leading to internal or external bleeding, organ failure and death. The death rate has run as high as 80%, although it was significantly lower in the initial outbreak when patients were cared for in relatively modern, European hospitals.","WHO representative: ""two cycles of incubation period"" totaling 42 days have passed .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- It's a position that John Quincy Adams once called downright pathetic: that of a former president. In his post-presidency, George Bush has plans to construct a presidential library and work on his memoirs. After all, the process of relinquishing the most powerful job in the world isn't an easy one, especially given the American public's notoriously fleeting attention span and penchant for paying little heed to once-prominent political figures after they exit the public stage. As the days dwindle until President Bush joins what Herbert Hoover called the ""most exclusive trade union in the world,"" the unpopular commander in chief recently declared that he's more than ready to forgo the limelight. Although ex-presidents in Adams' day quickly descended into obscurity after their years in the Oval Office, today the transition away from serving as the leader of the free world is high-profile, potentially very lucrative and, above all, a difficult job in itself. This is especially true for Bush, historians and political observers say. He not only must oversee the construction of a presidential library and begin writing his memoirs, but he also must grapple with salvaging a legacy mired in the lowest presidential approval ratings in history. ""The first year for every ex-president is really hard,"" said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University. ""You have to raise all this money for your library, you've got to build an organization, you have to write a huge memoir, your papers are in disarray, and you suddenly realize your mistakes because your pace slows down."" Bush has more than a month left in office, but planning for his post-presidential year began more than two years ago. In many ways, the process is in full swing. Fundraising and planning for his presidential library, to be built on the campus of Southern Methodist University in Dallas, is well under way. The president has started interviews with high-profile journalists, by all accounts already trying to define his legacy. But as the president is set to begin his stint out of office, the exact path he will take remains unclear. Bush has expressed interest in writing a memoir and hitting the highly profitable lecture circuit, but experts say both pursuits could pose pitfalls. Publishers, concerned the president's slumping approval ratings could translate to less-than-stellar book sales, have reportedly been lukewarm about a Bush book deal. Bush has expressed interest in cataloguing 10 crises he's faced, Brinkley said, but wary publishers are somewhat cold to that idea, perhaps concerned that a public still reeling from the country's financial meltdown might not have an appetite for the president's account of his own difficult times. Bush, like several of his predecessors, is also likely to embark on the business of making money -- and a lot of it -- off his status as a former occupant of the White House. The Clintons have made more than $100 million in the eight years since the curtain closed on their White House years, and Bush himself has said that his father earns $50,000 to $75,000 a speech. To be sure, profiting from their White House years is a staple for modern ex-presidents: Gerald Ford capitalized on his accidental 2½-year presidency by sitting on the board of several major corporations, and Ronald Reagan caused a stir when he netted $2 million for a few brief speeches in Japan in 1989. But the public's overwhelming disdain for the president may delay a speaking tour and Bush ascent to the corporate boardroom. ""He is a president where people are expecting some kind of repair work,"" said Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton. ""If he just goes on the speaking circuit and focuses his time making huge money, that would only tarnish a presidency that only has a low approval rating."" Instead, Bush is more likely to choose a similar post-presidential path, at least initially, as that of Jimmy Carter, who also left the White House with poor approval ratings, Zelizer said. Instead of seeking to profit off his years in office, Carter became a globe-trotting humanitarian and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for his work promoting social and economic justice. In the process, Carter has rehabilitated his image and transformed a legacy that had seemed unsalvageable three decades ago. ""What Jimmy Carter showed is that you can be very active in your post-presidential years and help improve how people think of you as a leader and a policy maker,"" Zelizer said. Bush and his handlers are mapping out this phase of the president's post-White House years. Plans are well under way for a ""Freedom Institute"" that will aim to promote democracies abroad. The institute, where Bush is expected to play a significant role, is expected to be unaffiliated with an academic institution. Its members are expected to be analysts whose views are in line with the neoconservative outlook that shaped the president's approach to foreign policy. ""This is going to be Bush vision."" Brinkley said of the institute. ""Bush has never liked the academics, and this is a nonacademic institute aimed at cutting to the core of things: only pro-democracy foot soldiers who are green-lit by George and Laura Bush are in the mix."" It's under the auspices of this think tank that the president might try to improve his legacy, in hopes that Freedom Institute might reveal virtues in the foreign policy vision that led to the most defining decision of his presidency, the invasion of Iraq. ""This president's low approval rating is overwhelmingly connected to Iraq. It will rise and fall depending what turns out to be the history of that country and that part of the world,"" said Stephen Hess, a former Eisenhower aide and a scholar at the conservative Brookings Institution. ""That really is what his legacy for future historians is all about.""","Ex-presidents of recent administrations have stepped into high-profile positions .

"(CNN) -- A 2-year-old boy who was reportedly the son of Minnesota Vikings star Adrian Peterson died Friday of injuries he suffered after allegedly being abused, police said. Sioux Falls, South Dakota, police said Joseph Robert Patterson, 27, has been charged with aggravated battery of an infant and aggravated assault. If convicted on the charges, both felonies, Patterson could face up to 40 years in prison and an $80,000 fine. Prosecutors are considering filing additional charges against Patterson in light of the boy's death, according to police. Soon after the news came out of the boy's death, Adrian Peterson took to Twitter to express his gratitude to his family, fans and the ""fraternity of brothers"" in the NFL for their support. ""God Bless everyone and thank u so much,"" he wrote. Patterson called authorities about 5:45 p.m. Wednesday to report that a 2-year-old was choking in his Sioux Falls apartment, police spokesman Sam Clemens said. Officers arrived to find the toddler unresponsive, and he was rushed to a nearby hospital. Authorities determined that the child had suffered injuries to his head consistent with abuse, according to Clemens. Police said Patterson, whom they described as the boyfriend of the injured child's mother, was the only other person in the residence at the time. The suspect -- who was given suspended sentences a year ago for simple domestic assault and violation of a domestic abuse bond, both misdemeanors -- was arrested Thursday night, said Lincoln County, South Dakota, State's Attorney Tom Wollman. A judge set his bail at $750,000 cash during his initial court appearance Friday, according to Clemens. The 2-year-old's mother is not under investigation, Clemens added. ""This is an absolute tragedy,"" Wollman said Friday, ""and the parents and the extended family are suffering greatly."" Authorities have declined to name the child, with police saying that information is ""being withheld out of respect for the family and to give them time to make notification."" Peterson's father, Nelson Peterson, told the St. Paul Pioneer Press that the injured toddler is his grandson and Adrian's son. Nelson Peterson did not identify the boy by name except to say he was not Adrian Peterson Jr. The 2012 NFL Most Valuable Player himself did not elaborate on what happened when addressing reporters earlier Friday, at which time the child was in critical condition. But he did acknowledge that he was dealing with ""a private matter,"" adding that he still plans to play in Sunday's game against the Carolina Panthers. ""I will ask you all to please just respect my privacy,"" Peterson said. Even if he wasn't talking, many athletes were. The Washington Redskins' Robert Griffin III and Houston Texans' defense lineman J.J. Watt were among Peterson's competitors who expressed condolences online, as well as their shock at what happened. Among the most vocal was LeBron James, who has won the NBA's MVP award four of the past five seasons. Declaring ""ol buddy will get what's coming to him!!"" -- an apparent reference to the suspect -- James expressed the sorrow he felt, as a young father himself, while offering support to his friend. ""So Damn sad man!"" the Miami Heat star tweeted. ""Makes no sense at all. Innocent kid with dreams gets taking away by a coward with no dreams at all! Smh #SickForAP.""

"(CNN) -- Florida Gov. Rick Scott on Sunday defended recent legislation that requires adults applying for welfare assistance to undergo drug screenings, saying the law provides ""personal accountability."" ""It's not right for taxpayer money to be paying for somebody's drug addiction,"" Scott told CNN's T.J. Holmes on Sunday. ""On top of that, this is going to increase personal responsibility, personal accountability. We shouldn't be subsidizing people's addiction."" But the ACLU of Florida, which has already filed suit against Scott over a measure requiring government employees to undergo random drug testing, disagrees, and may sue over the welfare law as well. ""What (Scott) is doing is giving ugly legitimacy to an unfortunate stereotype that has been in this country for a couple of decades -- that all welfare recipients are a bunch of drug abusers,"" said Howard Simon, executive director of the ACLU of Florida. Scott told CNN he wants to ensure that welfare funds go to their primary target -- to disadvantaged children -- and provide people with an incentive not to use drugs. He signed the measure on June 1, calling it ""the right thing for taxpayers."" Under the law, which takes effect on July 1, the Florida Department of Children and Family Services will be required to conduct the drug tests on adults applying to the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. The aid recipients would be responsible for the cost of the screening, which they would recoup in their assistance if they qualify. Those who fail the required drug testing may designate another individual to receive the benefits on behalf of their children, and do not receive a refund for the test. Shortly after the bill was signed, five Democrats from the state's congressional delegation issued a joint statement attacking the legislation, one calling it ""downright unconstitutional."" ""Governor Scott's new drug testing law is not only an affront to families in need and detrimental to our nation's ongoing economic recovery, it is downright unconstitutional,"" said Rep. Alcee Hastings. ""If Governor Scott wants to drug test recipients of TANF benefits, where does he draw the line? Are families receiving Medicaid, state emergency relief, or educational grants and loans next?"" ""I work for the ACLU, and it's our job to prevent trampling on the constitutional rights of people,"" Simon said. The Constitution mandates that searches cannot be conducted without probable cause, he said. Controversy over the measure was heightened by Scott's past association with a company he co-founded that operates walk-in urgent care clinics in Florida and counts drug screening among the services it provides. In April, Scott, who had transferred his ownership interest in Solantic Corp. to a trust in his wife's name, said the company would not contract for state business, according to local media reports. Asked about the company Sunday, Scott said he is in the process of selling his family's interest in the company and ""it will be sold in a couple of weeks."" There is no conflict of interest, he said. On May 18, the Florida Ethics Commission ruled that two conflict-of-interest complaints against Scott were legally insufficient to warrant investigation, and adopted an opinion that no ""prohibited conflict of interest"" existed. On the measure requiring public employees to undergo drug testing, Simon noted that public employees -- workers in city, county, state and federal government -- are protected by the Constitution and should not undergo ""intrusive"" drug testing without probable cause to believe a person is using drugs.","Gov.

"(CNN) -- A veteran Iranian human rights activist has warned that Sakineh Mohammadie Ashtiani, a mother of two, could be stoned to death at any moment under the terms of a death sentence handed down by Iranian authorities. Only an international campaign designed to pressure the regime in Tehran can save her life, according to Mina Ahadi, head of the International Committee Against Stoning and the Death Penalty. ""Legally it's all over,"" Ahadi said Sunday. ""It's a done deal. Sakineh can be stoned at any minute."" ""That is why we have decided to start a very broad, international public movement. Only that can help."" Ashtiani, 42, will be buried up to her chest, according to an Amnesty International report citing the Iranian penal code. The stones that will be hurled at her will be large enough to cause pain but not so large as to kill her immediately. Ashtiani, who is from the northern city of Tabriz, was convicted of adultery in 2006. She was forced to confess after being subjected to 99 lashes, human rights lawyer Mohammad Mostafaei said Thursday in a telephone interview from Tehran. She later retracted that confession and has denied wrongdoing. Her conviction was based not on evidence but on the determination of three out of five judges, Mostafaei said. She has asked forgiveness from the court but the judges refused to grant clemency. Iran's supreme court upheld the conviction in 2007. Mostafaei believes a language barrier prevented his client from fully comprehending court proceedings. Ashtiani is of Azerbaijani descent and speaks Turkish, not Farsi. The circumstances of Ashtiani's case make it not an exception but the rule in Iran, according to Amnesty International, which tracks death penalty cases around the world. ""The majority of those sentenced to death by stoning are women, who suffer disproportionately from such punishment,"" the human rights group said in a 2008 report. On Wednesday, Amnesty made a new call to the Iranian government to immediately halt all executions and commute all death sentences. The group has recorded 126 executions in Iran from the start of this year to June 6. ""The organization is also urging the authorities to review and repeal death penalty laws, to disclose full details of all death sentences and executions and to join the growing international trend towards abolition,"" the statement said. Ahadi, who fled Iran in the early 1980s, told CNN that pressure from Amnesty and other organizations and individuals is likely the only way to save Ashtiani. ""Experience shows (that) ... when the pressure gets very high, the Islamic government starts to say something different,"" she said. In Washington, the State Department has criticized the scheduled stoning, saying it raised serious concerns about human rights violations by the Iranian government. ""We have grave concerns that the punishment does not fit the alleged crime, "" Assistant Secretary of State P.J. Crowley said Thursday. ""For a modern society such as Iran, we think this raises significant human rights concerns."" Calling Iran's judicial system ""disproportionate"" in its treatment of women, Crowley said, ""From the United States' standpoint, we don't think putting women to death for adultery is an appropriate punishment."" Human rights activists have been pushing the Islamic government to abolish stoning, arguing that women are not treated equally before the law in Iran and are especially vulnerable in the judicial system. A woman's testimony is worth half that of a man, they say. Article 74 of the Iranian penal code requires at least four witnesses -- four men or three men and two women -- for an adulterer to receive a stoning sentence, said Ahadi, of the International Committee Against Stoning. But there were no witnesses in Ashtiani's case. Often, said Ahadi, husbands turn wives in to get out of a marriage. Mostafaei said he could not understand how such a savage method of death could exist in the year 2010 or how an innocent woman could be taken from her son and daughter, who have written to the court pleading for their mother's life. The public won't be allowed to witness the stoning, Mostafaei said, for fear of condemnation of such a brutal method. He is hoping there won't be an execution. Mostafaei, who himself did jail time in the aftermath of the disputed presidential elections in June 2009, said he realizes the risk of speaking out for Ashtiani, for fighting for human rights. But he doesn't let that deter him. He last saw Ashtiani five months ago behind bars in Tabriz. Since then, he said, he has been searching for a way to save her from the stones. CNN's Moni Basu, Ben Brumfield, Bobby Afshar, Gena Somra, Mitra Mobasherat and Elise Labott contributed to this report.","Sakineh Ashtiani was sentenced to death on adultery charges .

"(CNN) -- The 30-mile highway from Kifri to Tuz Khurmatu in northern Iraq is a no-man's-land dotted with motley gatherings of thousands of displaced families, caught between the cruelty of ISIS forces and targeted by militias backed by Iraq's government. In August, these people lived in towns around Tuz and Amerli, at the epicenter of fighting in which the militias, Iraqi security forces and Kurdish Peshmerga, assisted by U.S.-led airstrikes, supposedly drove ISIS forces (ISIS calls itself the Islamic State) from the area. No one stayed to protect civilians from the aftermath; their homes were looted and burned by militias, they say, after ISIS pulled out. Now, several thousand families from this region, about 90 kilometers south of Kirkuk, are eking out an existence in makeshift shelters along the road, caught between contested territory and the mountains leading to the relative safety of Iraq's Kurdish region. At a defunct chicken factory, I met some 40 families who said they had been living there for two months without a visit, let alone any assistance, from humanitarian organizations or government officials. Despite warnings from international aid agencies about deteriorating conditions for people displaced by conflict in other parts of Iraq, these communities have been overlooked. Their current residences -- the chicken factory, a school, makeshift tents -- are too dangerous to visit, according to representatives of local humanitarian organizations. A woman named Shahlaa says that like many of the people forced from the towns around Tuz and Amerli, she was displaced twice: first when ISIS entered her town and warned of an impending battle, and then when militias attacked the village to which she had fled with her husband and three small children. ""We didn't get to stay there very long,"" Shahlaa said of the village. After a week she saw dozens of SUVs, armored vehicles and pickup trucks approaching. She watched, terrified, as ""so, so many"" pro-government militiamen dressed in black piled out carrying automatic weapons. ""They started shooting in the air and at the ground, they just wanted to scare us out of there,"" she said. But the militia leniency didn't last very long. After driving ISIS fighters from the area between Kifri and Amerli, the militias began looting and burning homes. Families described how, after running for their lives, they sat on a hillside overlooking their towns and watched them burn. They are not alone. Militias have emptied almost 80 towns of their Sunni residents, a sheikh in Kirkuk told me. Other sheikhs, security and government officials, and some of those displaced have said the same. Yet none of the displaced from these towns has received aid, he said. The sheikh said that militiamen forced him out by setting fire to his home and scrawling their unit names on his walls well after ISIS had left the area: the Badr Brigades, Saraya al-Salam, Kita'ib Hezbollah, and Saraya al-Khorasani. These are all powerful Shia militias with high-level representatives in Iraq's government. At the chicken factory, Shahlaa gestured to the industrial equipment in a small room where she sleeps alongside 16 relatives. ""Look at where we're living,"" she said in disgust. The area is particularly windy and rains have become heavier as winter approaches. ""When we left, we barely had time to take anything with us; we're sharing blankets,"" she said. ""We're running out of food and water and we're running out of money. How will we survive the winter?"" Not only are these displaced families exposed to the elements, but they also are still caught perilously between ISIS and the militias. One man living in a makeshift camp nearby told me militiamen picked him up a couple of days earlier but released him ""because they decided I was too old."" But many of his neighbors remain detained, he said. Recently, the United Nations humanitarian agency, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, launched a plan to help displaced persons in Iraq, requesting $1.6 billion and noting that ""early contributions [are] essential with the onset of winter."" But even if it raises funds, it is unlikely that OCHA or its humanitarian partners will be able to reach the people who most desperately need help in time to save them. The U.S. and Iraqi governments are supporting displaced people in relatively safe areas, but will they be able to reach the 40 families I met -- or others in hazardous conditions -- in time to save them from freezing or starving to death this winter? Given that the Iraqi government and U.S.-led coalition created the conditions these people are living -- by attacking their areas and often leaving them to the mercy of the militias -- the same governments should now step in to facilitate humanitarian access, lest history makes their ""liberation"" operation look more like a pathway to a massacre. As I left the chicken factory, children swarmed around me, giggling and wanting to show me how they slept like chickens packed into a room. As much as I wanted to, I couldn't spare the time. I had already stayed dangerously long and the risk that someone hostile to my presence had noticed -- whether ISIS or a militiaman -- was just too high. I left the factory and its tenants behind, just as they remain out of reach and abandoned by the international community, the authorities in Baghdad and the Kurdistan Regional Government.","Conditions are deteriorating for many displaced in Iraq, says Erin Evers .

"(CNN) -- Microsoft's new video game console, the Xbox One, made its long-awaited debut last month. The real story here isn't about video games, though. A lot has changed in the seven years since the current Xbox 360 launched. Gaming on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets has exploded while traditional console gaming remains relatively stagnant. The challenge for any new video game console is to make it more than just a fancy computer that reads game discs. So how does the Xbox One try to differentiate itself? Television. The Xbox One is designed to be the hub for all your living room entertainment, not just games. It can plug into your cable box and pipe live TV through your console using an HDMI cable, meaning you won't have to switch inputs. Instead of seeing your cable company's clunky on-screen menu system, you get a new guide designed by Microsoft that can can recommend shows and let you change the channel using your voice. Microsoft's demos of TV on the Xbox One were pretty impressive, too. You can seamlessly and instantaneously switch between a game, Blu-Ray movie or live cable TV without fiddling with a remote control. Just say out loud what you want to watch, and the Xbox will do the rest. There are also a few content deals with ESPN and the NFL that let you manage your fantasy sports teams while watching games live. Pretty cool, right? Unfortunately, the Xbox One won't work like magic for everyone, and it's pretty clear that Microsoft has hit the same roadblocks Google, Apple and others have when it comes to revolutionizing the way we watch TV. There are a lot of cable TV features the Xbox One won't be able to re-create, at least at first. You won't be able to watch on-demand shows. You won't be able to record shows to the Xbox's hard drive. And it can directly integrate with your cable box only if you have a newer model with an HDMI cable, meaning many people will have to use an old-fashioned infrared sensor instead. Fans air concerns about new PlayStation, Xbox . You're still limited to watching whatever happens to be on live TV, which, unfortunately for Microsoft, isn't the only way people watch TV anymore. We've been through this before. Two years ago, Google introduced Google TV, which also adds a Web-powered layer on top of cable. It was an interesting concept but one that has still failed to take off with the public. The service still relies on a regular cable box, and at its core, it's just another fancy interface that tries to improve your regular on-screen menu. Now for some good news. Microsoft still has the option to improve the Xbox One's TV features through software updates. After the console's announcement last week, Xbox hardware boss Todd Holmdahl told me it would be possible to allow the Xbox One to act as a DVR in a future update, just like other third-party DVRs such as TiVo. In the end, though, the Xbox One, or any other video game console or streaming box like Roku or Apple TV, won't be able to truly change TV until it can clear a huge obstacle: persuading major cable companies to ditch their set-top boxes and use theirs instead.

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Kenya will hold a general election on March 4 next year, the country's Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission Chairman Issak Hassan announced Saturday. The vote will be the first since ethnic violence followed disputed elections four years ago and left more than 1,000 people dead and 350,000 displaced, according to the Kenya Red Cross. In that election, both Mwai Kibaki, the incumbent, and challenger Raila Odinga claimed to have won. The post-election chaos escalated into ethnic violence with members of the president's tribe, the Kikuyu, fighting members of Odinga's Luo tribe and other groups. The two later entered into a power-sharing agreement, with Odinga named prime minister and Kibaki named president. Setting the date for new elections has been a contentious process. Under the old constitution, the president had the power to dissolve parliament after which the electoral body would announce the election date. But under the new constitution, agreed in 2010, the election date is already set -- it's in August, every five years. However, because Kenya is in a unique situation -- it has a coalition government following the 2007 disputed elections -- the president and prime minister have to agree on when to dissolve the coalition parliament to pave way for the electoral body to set an election date. This scenario generated ambiguity as to when the next general election would be held, which led a group of Kenyans to move to the high court. The court ruling gave two options. One was that the president and prime minister agree on a date to dissolve the coalition, allowing the election to be called . The second was to wait for the lapse of the current parliamentary term, which is January 14, 2013, and then hold the election within 60 days after that, as set out in the law. Since the president and prime minister could not reach agreement, with the president favoring the second option and the prime minister keen to see a 2012 election, the IEBC opted to take the second option. Odinga's political party, the Orange Democratic Movement, had urged the commission to set a date in December this year. The commission ""should avoid any temptation of serving any sectarian interests through extension of the life of the coalition government,"" the party said in a statement. A December date was the preferred option of the majority of the Kenyan people and would be in line with the high court ruling and a recommendation by the Cabinet, the party said. Kenyans will be keen to avoid any repeat of the violence that swept the country four years ago. In January, the International Criminal Court ruled that four Kenyan officials, including Deputy Prime Minister Uhuru Kenyatta, will stand trial on human rights violations that are alleged to have occurred after the 2007 election. Kenyatta and Cabinet Secretary Francis Muthaura are accused of crimes against humanity. Former Agriculture Minister William Ruto and radio journalist Joshua Arap Sang face similar charges. The men named by the ICC come from opposite sides of the disputed 2007 election. They deny wrongdoing.","The general election will be the first since a disputed vote in 2007 resulted in ethnic violence .

"(CNN) -- Imagine the chaos of Black Friday -- but worse. Every shopper's nightmare was lived out on Thursday when a horde of rowdy teens stampeded through a New York mall -- screaming, wreaking havoc and banging on shop doors. ""Things are back to normal with more police around,"" Joli Chen, a worker at a beauty supply store, said Saturday. ""But the other day was crazy. Black Friday was normal compared to that. They were making trouble."" Flash mobs have been known to descend on malls across the country, singing, dancing and even accompanying couples getting engaged. But the Brooklyn flash mob isn't the first to turn ugly. In the summer of 2012, a Walmart in Jacksonville, Florida, was mobbed by 300 people who entered the store and destroyed the security system, according to CNN affiliate WJXT. Police said the group destroyed an electronic anti-shoplifting security scanner that cost about $1,500, WJXT reported. The massive crowd descended on the store after a party that was broken up nearby. No arrests were made. In New York, Chen and others described a flash mob of more than 300 teens who, at first, started gathering at Brooklyn's Kings Plaza Shopping Center before erupting in a frenzy of yelling, running, shoving and pounding on doors. Many stores were forced to shut down on the busy shopping day after Christmas. ""They tried to scare us,"" Chen said. ""They were cursing at us. The police tried to keep them moving but there were so many. And there are so many entrances, they kept coming back in."" On Friday, the mall turned away unaccompanied minors. On Saturday, Chen said, teens were allowed to shop again. A New York police spokesman confirmed that more than 300 rowdy teens overran the Kings Plaza mall the day after Christmas. At about 6 p.m., groups roamed the mall banging on glass storefronts while cursing and screaming at people, mall employee Rickie Liu told CNN. Reports of damage were unclear, but some teens picked up a glass container filled with candy and shattered it on the floor, the owner of a candy kiosk told CNN affiliate WCBS. The rambunctious crowd turned what is usually a quiet mall into a terrifying place, said mall employee Charmaine Chen. Many stores were forced to shutter their gates on a busy day. Liu said she received a call from mall security advising store employees to lock store doors for their own safety. Shop owner Kenny Pak received a call from security telling him there were teens fighting and causing a commotion. Police arrived after mall security called for backup at around 9 p.m., said a New York police spokesman. Officers eventually escorted nearly the disorderly teens out of the mall. The coordinated chaos lasted about two hours, according to Liu, and ruined expected good sales. Her shop didn't even reach $100 in business by 6 p.m., Liu said. Police said there were no arrests made or complaints filed with the authorities about damage or assaults. Police were reviewing mall security video as part of their investigation.

"(CNN) -- The father of a 15-month-old boy who died after being left in a car in July has been charged with criminally negligent homicide, according to police in Connecticut. Kyle Seitz, 36, turned himself in at Ridgefield police headquarters on Tuesday afternoon, according to a statement from Capt. Jeff Kreitz. After being processed, Seitz was released on a written promise to appear in Danbury Superior Court on Wednesday morning, Kreitz said. The death of Benjamin Seitz was ruled a homicide in August. On July 7, Seitz was supposed to drop his son off at day care, but the dropoff never occurred, his wife, Lindsey Rogers-Seitz told CNN in July. Seitz drove to work and at the end of the day he went to pick Benjamin up at day care, only to realize he was not there, authorities said. When Seitz realized his son was in the car, he rushed the child to the hospital, but Benjamin had died. The cause of the boy's death was hyperthermia due to environmental exposure, according to the state medical examiner. Neither Seitz nor his attorney immediately responded immediately to CNN's requests for comment Tuesday. Grieving mother's mission to stop hot car deaths . The Connecticut death came a month after a similar incident in suburban Atlanta garnered national headlines. In the latter instance, a grand jury ended up indicting Justin Ross Harris on eight counts, including malice murder and two counts of felony murder, over the death of his 22-month-old son, Cooper. Through his attorneys, Harris has claimed that he forgot to drop off the boy at daycare and mistakenly left him in his 2011 Hyundai Tucson on a day when the temperature topped 92 degrees. At least 44 children died in 2013 from heatstroke caused by being left in cars in the United States, according to the national nonprofit organization KidsAndCars.org. At least 30 children have died this year for the same reason. Over the past decade, the group figures, there have been at least 388 children who have died of vehicular heatstroke.","Kyle Seitz turns himself in, faces charge .

"(CNN) -- They might not be the first police force to add an electric vehicle to their fleet, but Scotts Valley Police Department in California surely has one of the most stylish. The Zero DS motorcycle is part trail, part road bike and has a top speed of 55 miles per hour, which might not make it so useful in a high-speed pursuit. But what it lacks in horsepower it more than makes up for in stealth. Powered by a lithium-ion battery (which takes four hours to recharge) the bike hardly makes a sound -- thus allowing police to exercise their own right to silence before uttering a similar sentence to law-breakers. Police departments all over the world are embracing all manner of electric vehicles, recognizing their duty of care to the environment as well as to the citizens of the streets they patrol. One of the more popular electric models to hit the market in recent years is the T3, manufactured by California-based T3 Motion. The three-wheel stand-up bike has proved popular not only with police forces but also with security companies and the military. The zero emissions trike affords drivers an elevated platform giving them wide visibility and ""a commanding presence,"" say its manufacturers. Maneuverable yet sturdy, the T3 has found a home with police departments in the Middle East, North America, Europe and Asia. Another electric car that a law enforcement force might be happy to have in its fleet is BMW's Electric MINI, which has been styled by German tuning company, AC Schnitzer. Unveiled at the Essen Motor Show, Germany at the end of 2010, the design was part of a safety initiative by Germany's Federal Transport Ministry. Sadly, the car isn't available yet. Carl Archambeault imagines his ""Scarab"" concept as an eco-friendly accomplice in combating crime.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Maybe you've decided to show your partner love with a new iPhone. But how about 99 of them? In Chinese, the number 9 sounds like ""forever,"" so on Sunday a man proposed marriage to his partner in Guangzhou, China by lining up 99 brand new iPhone 6s into the shape of a heart. The phones cost him around two years worth of savings to buy, but it's unclear whether she said yes. November 11 is China's Singles' Day (it's the date with the most 1s). As a bit of inspiration to those who have yet to leap into happily ever after, here's a quick list of some of China's most creative and entertaining marriage proposals in recent years. The hot and spicy . Dou Ziwang's romance must be sizzling hot, because on August 29, he proposed to his girlfriend using two massive hearts made of 99,999 red chili peppers. Now there's one guy who knows how to spice up a relationship. See the photos. (People's Daily) A frank proposal . Here's one that'll make you hungry for love -- or maybe just hungry. 28-year-old Wang Han met his girlfriend in a hot dog store while both were vacationing in Thailand and soon fell in love. On August 20, 1,001 days after their sausage link-up, he asked her to be his wife by presenting her with 1,001 hot dogs spelling out the words ""I love you."" She said yes -- with relish. See the photos. (China News) More than meets the eye . You have to see this one to believe it. In December 2013, a young man proposed marriage by building an 8-meter tall replica of Optimus Prime from the movie Transformers, weighing a solid ton. No word on how his girlfriend responded, but we can only imagine she transformed into his wife. See the photos. (iFeng) A heroic gesture . Two years ago, in Jiangsu province, a young man made a superhuman effort to win his partner's hand in marriage -- by dressing up as Superman, then using a crane to hoist himself 19 stories into the air while holding 9,999 balloons. As his girlfriend walked by, people shouted for her to look up at the sky. He then gracefully descended from the sky, ring in hand. (She said yes.) See the photos. (19lou) Coming up roses . On Valentines Day 2012, Xiao Fan wanted to impress his girlfriend -- a lover of clothing -- with more than just a bouquet of two dozen roses. See where this is going? Yes; this smooth operator created a beautiful dress for his beautiful girlfriend using exactly 9,999 roses, which she proudly donned while he asked for her hand in marriage. She accepted. See the photos. (CCTV) A romance worthy of the big screen . One of Beijing's shopping centers, named The Place, features a jaw-droppingly massive LED-screen ""sky.""

See the video. (Youku) Proposal goes swimmingly . This man won major style points in 2011. After secretly practicing for months, he rode a dolphin across a pool to his girlfriend as she stood unsuspecting on the other side, before proposing in front of a cheering crowd. The woman was shocked -- but remember, he did it on porpoise. See the video. (AP) An address in a dress . Finally, one to reverse the gender norms. Last month, a college-aged woman named Lu Huan from Wuhan surprised her boyfriend by delivering a tearjerking speech while wearing a white wedding dress. ""Others all think I am a little too impatient, whether it is too early for us,"" she cried to her partner. ""I want to say, when we meet the right person, no matter how early it is, it is still too late. Do you want to marry me?"" He said yes. See the video.

"(CNN) -- Downton Abbey, with its snooty aristocrats and even snootier butlers, has never been somewhere for the likes of us. Until now. Highclere Castle, the posh British mansion that doubles as Downton in the long-running UK television series, is opening up rooms to paying guests. Bookings are now being taken for London Lodge, an historic gateway that forms a grand entrance to Highclere's extensive grounds in the countryside west of London. Built around 1840, the ""unique and luxurious"" accommodation for two has, according to the estate, been restored over the past two years by the current Earl of Carnarvon and his wife (although they may have had help). The rooms are split across the two buildings flanking the original gateway built in 1793. Majestic Victorian castle . On one side there's a kitchen and sitting room arranged around a wood-burning stove. On the other there's a double bedroom, bathroom and dressing area. There are no servants quarters, so guests shouldn't expect white-gloved flunkeys delivering their morning newspaper. And, since it's unlikely to available during filming, there's little chance of being witheringly insulted by the acid-tongued Dowager Duchess of Grantham. What is on offer is a chance to gaze enviously at one of Britain's most majestic Victorian castles and the surrounding 6,000 acres of parkland. Situated to the north of the castle, the lodge will be available for Valentine's Day 2015 and for selected weekends through the spring and summer. There's no need to ask Carson to make the reservation. Weekend stays, priced from $545 per night, can be booked via the castle's website.

"(CNN) -- Even though we're still a couple of weeks from Black Friday, there seems to be a preseason special on snow and cold. The upper Midwest and Great Lakes are buried in snow, shivering under the icy blanket. Track winter weather . From the Rockies to the heartland, ferocious winds are ripping across the Plains, bringing freezing temperatures as far south as Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle. And there's more coming. ""Round two gets colder. This is not over by any means,"" CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said Tuesday. ""The next 10 days over the entire eastern half of the country will be below normal."" Hardly anyone in the eastern two-thirds of the nation will be spared by the time the weekend hits. Here's how everyone is faring against the elements. Minnesota: Land of the Vikings (You got that right) The people of Minnesota are hardy folks, tempered by years of long brutal winters. Still, they don't normally get it so soon. ""This is the first snow I've seen this season, and it's a major snowstorm, rather than the usual light dusting you'd expect to start off the winter with,"" said Katie Robinson of St. Paul. She woke up Monday to find snow on the ground. ""I think that's the biggest thing -- that we went from a very warm and mild fall to now being thrust so abruptly into winter."" Many stayed inside but some ventured outdoors -- and got into accidents, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported. The heavier snow fell to the north. St. Augusta, Minnesota, about 70 miles northwest of Minneapolis, reported a whopping 16.5 inches Monday, according to the National Weather Service. Snowfall of 10 inches and above was common across the state's northern tier and it created a mess. The snow dusted up travelers in the Twin Cities. Minnesota State Patrol spokesman Lt. Eric Roeske said troopers responded to 475 crashes across the region from 5 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday, 45 with injuries and one fatal. He reported 702 spinouts and incidents of vehicles running off the road. Wisconsin: Our kind of weather . Even with the inconveniences, people in the North know how to deal with snow. Dare we say it makes them a bit giddy? ""This has been the buzz this weekend,"" Greg Graves, an employee at Mel's Trading Post in Rhinelander told CNN affiliate WJFW. ""Most of our customers love to be outdoors, so everyone is really looking forward to it,"" he said. In Eau Claire, Jason Stuttgen told CNN affiliate WQOW the snow's coming at the perfect time. ""Especially two weeks before gun hunting (season), that's always going to help the deer move,"" he told the station. Montana: Too darn cold . Temperatures plummeted as bitterly cold winds rushed down the front range of the Rocky Mountains. In Billings, Montana, temperatures over the weekend were in the 50s, but Wednesday will bring overnight lows below zero and daytime highs in the single digits. With overnight temperatures plunging close to record lows for the date, downtown Billings, the heart of Montana's largest city, was very empty. Those who did venture out in the cold said they were ready. ""We just watched the alerts, and when they say it's going to be cold, we just bundle up,"" resident Tessa Rogers said. Chia Wei Lo said he was taking the plunging temperatures in stride. ""When I just moved to Montana,"" he said, ""my friend told me, if you don't like the weather wait 10 minutes."" The snow is pretty much done for now, but snowfall amounts of 5 to 14 inches were common across the western half of the state. The South: Cold, but not as cold . The northern Mountain States, the Plains and the Midwest are not the only targets. Much of the nation will shiver under the cold air. ""I think we're all going to be feeling the bite,"" CNN meteorologist Indra Petersons said. The cold snap will bring lows in the teens and single digits into Iowa, Kansas and Colorado this week but also spread freezing temperatures as far south as Texas. A hard freeze warning extends to just north of the Dallas-Fort Worth area. ""Much of the nation east of the Rockies is expected to see a major pattern change by the beginning of the work week,"" the weather service said. The frosty blast will move across the rest of the United States, but it will not be as harsh as in the Midwest. Atlanta and Birmingham, Alabama, are expecting daytime high temperatures in the mid-40s on Friday, according to the National Weather Service. A normal high this time of year is 64. How did this happen? Residents in the northern United States can thank Super Typhoon Nuri for this mess. It is the strongest post-tropical cyclone on record in the North Pacific, the NWS said. Its remnants are haunting us now, less than two weeks after Halloween. The storm system plowed into all that arctic cold air in Alaska and northern Canada, forcing it south. Things will get warmer over the weekend, but it won't stay that way, forecasters say. Another arctic blast is on the way for next week. Lucky us.

"(CNN) -- If you've ever been at a crowded bar or a packed party, you have probably waited a long time for a drink. One answer to that problem: a new bartender with the generic French name of Monsieur. He's short and squat and not much of a conversationalist, but he'll whip up a Screwdriver for you in a flash. The Monsieur is a boxy tabletop device that works like a vending machine for cocktails. Punch in your order on a colorful touchscreen or order from your phone, and the machine will blend liquor with mixers and pour them into your cup. When fully equipped, Monsieur can make up to 300 types of drinks. ""It's very intuitive, simple to use and easily programmable to your drink preferences,"" said Libby Panke, who tried the machine at a recent launch event in Atlanta. Panke requested a seasonal recommendation and received a vodka and orange juice, which she said was ""very good."" The device is the brainchild of Barry Givens, co-founder and CEO of Monsieur, the startup behind the machine. Givens came up with the idea for a ""robotic bartender,"" as he calls it, while struggling to get a drink at a crowded bar one spring during the NBA Finals. He and fellow Georgia Tech alum Eric Williams, Monsieur's chief technology officer, designed the machine after a fundraising campaign on Kickstarter. The Monsieur measures 20 inches high and 21 inches wide and bears a color Android touchscreen allowing customers to browse and order drinks from up to eight mixers and liquors. The touchscreen controls coolers, pumps, sensors and other mechanical components to blend ingredients and deliver your drink. Beneath the touchscreen is an opening where you place your cup. A sensor prevents the drink from pouring until the cup is in place. Each Monsieur comes with 12 themes, such as ""bachelorette party,"" ""Irish pub"" or ""cigar bar,"" and each theme offers 20 to 25 drink selections. The machine offers only liquor-based drinks, but its creators are open to adding beer, wine and Champagne. Consumers can also create themes and drinks and share them with others via social media. Givens hopes Monsieur will become the iTunes of cocktails, allowing people from around the world to exchange themes and cocktails the way they share songs or albums online. Williams says one special feature of Monsieur is its artificial intelligence: The machine can recommend drinks based on what you have ordered in the past, the season or time of day. It also can be programmed from your smartphone to, say, serve you a drink when you arrive home from work. Another feature Givens is proud of is the ""responsibility"" section of the Monsieur mobile app. You can enter your gender and weight, and the app will keep track of how much liquor you have consumed and estimate your blood-alcohol level. Once you have reached a certain level -- in most U.S. states, drivers are legally drunk with a blood-alcohol level of .08 -- Monsieur can send a notification to your phone. If you are driving, Monsieur will prompt you to the Uber app to find you a driver or a taxi. Givens also says the app can ""cut drinkers off"" by monitoring their profile and determining when they've had too much. ""We want to revolutionize this whole experience. ... We are using all this technology. There is no way we can't try to help people drink more responsibly,"" he said. Givens and Williams hope to see Monsieur installed in bars and suites at sports venues. They say they don't want to replace bartenders but to augment their services. To eliminate underage drinking, Williams suggests that bars hand out radio frequency identification wristbands when they check customers' IDs. The wristbands will have RFID chips inside them confirming that the wearer is over 21. Before a customer can buy a drink from a Monsieur machine, they'll have to scan their RFID wristband. The Monsieur team hopes to implement this technology into the machine by April. The Monsieur currently has no system to accept payments, but Givens and Williams would like to add a feature that would let patrons pay for drinks online or by swiping a card on the machine. Monsieur is not the only robotic bartender hitting the market. A California company claims that its Bartendro, a liquid-dispensing system of pumps and exposed tubes, can create a cocktail in 10 seconds. The Makr Shakr app allows partygoers to control a three-armed robot bartender using their cellphones. At the Atlanta event, Panke and fellow drinker Ken Ferguson said they could see themselves using the Monsieur for parties, events and football games. ""You don't need to pay for a bartender; you just need ice. People can serve themselves at parties now,"" Ferguson said. If you want a Monsieur of your own to make you drinks, it will cost you. The retail price is $5,000, which doesn't include shipping costs. Commercial customers will pay a one-time setup fee of $1,000 plus $299 per month for a subscription that includes tech support and access to a Web app allowing them to monitor the status of their Monsieur in real time. Givens envisions the future of Monsieur much like Starbucks. He wants his robotic bartender to become synonymous with social drinking, the way Starbucks is to coffee. In the future ""wherever you are, there will be a Monsieur system close by, and you will go through a seamless process to get a cocktail,"" he said.","Monsieur, a ""robotic bartender"" machine, can make up to 300 kinds of cocktails .

"New York (CNN)  -- Could letting your man sleep with another woman help your relationship? Author and former mistress Holly Hill thinks so. ""One of the main things that I have learned is that a woman that negotiates infidelity with her partner is far more powerful than a woman who is sitting home wondering why he's late from the office Christmas party,"" she says. ""It's better to walk the dog on a leash than let it escape through an unseen hole in the back fence."" Hill's memoir, ""Sugarbabe"" details her yearlong adventure with a series of so-called ""sugar daddies."" The book sold 24,000 copies in her native Australia, according to her publisher, and has just been released in the United States. Holly Hill is a pen name. ""I thought it was men that would like the book,"" she says, ""But in fact it's women, because what it says to women is that if your man cheats on you, he still loves you, and he's probably running about average."" Allowing their men to stray is a concept that's difficult for most women to contemplate. But Hill says that if a woman takes the time to truly examine her relationship and considers Mother Nature's unerring spell on men's libidos, she might realize that letting her boyfriend or spouse know she's OK with him having sex elsewhere is a logical way to prevent him from doing it in secret. ""I think that cheating men are normal,"" says Hill. ""Monogamous men are heroes. Monogamy does have a place in relationships, but not on the long-term. Men are hard-wired to betray women on the long-term."" But psychology professor Lawrence Josephs believes it is more personality type than gender that indicates whether a person might cheat. ""People who are higher in narcissim -- whether they are male or female -- are more likely to cheat. People who feel entitled to it, people who have what's called avoidant attachment style where they tend to have more impersonal sex,"" are more prone to straying, he said. The professor also said people who experience lower levels of empathy or guilt tend to engage in more infidelity. Hill says, that of course it's every woman's right to refuse to have sex when she's not in the mood or has a headache. However, expecting men to cope on their own with no outlet whatsoever is shortsighted and cruel, says Hill. The author, who holds a psychology degree from the University of Southern Queensland, says her experience as a ""sugarbabe"" taught her some valuable lessons about what drives men to seek sex outside marriage. Finding herself in financial dire straits after her married boyfriend unexpectedly dumped her four years ago (he had persuaded her to quit her job and enjoy his financial support as part of ""the mistress plan""), she decided to get creative about her employment options. Hill, who was 39 at the time, posted an ad online announcing her search for a sugar daddy, someone who would pay her $1,000 a week in exchange for her company, cooking, conversation, massages and, when they desired it, sex. She says the ad attracted 11,000 responses. At the time, Hill says she saw a distinct difference between what she was doing and prostitution. ""I thought that because I was a 24/7 exclusive mistress that I wasn't part of the world's oldest profession, but with hindsight I was, because what I was doing ... I was charging men for services, part of which included sex,"" says Hill. However, she adds, any married woman who no longer loves her husband but continues to have sex with him to retain the comforts of being married could also be considered part of that oldest profession. Most of Hill's ""daddies"" were wealthy married men who surprisingly often opted for conversation, she says. While entertaining with red wine and exotic food platters she'd prepare in her Sydney apartment, Hill learned that most of these men sought her attention because they simply weren't getting enough sex from their wives. ""Men need to get their rocks off,"" says Hill. ""If a woman crosses her legs for any length of time and doesn't arrange some sort of alternative for her man, he is going to cheat on her."" By alternatives, Hill is referring to her idea of ""negotiated infidelity."" That shouldn't be confused with an open relationship, which to Hill ""has no rules."" Nor does it imply that it's necessary that a wife allow her husband to hop into bed with whomever he chooses -- unless of course she's OK with that. Hill says negotiated infidelity could mean hubby makes a trip to the local strip club for the occasional lap dance or updates his porn collection. And in no way does it have to be a one-way street. ""Ideally the woman will want to stray as well,"" says Hill. ""Some won't want to because they're at home taking care of toddlers. But the woman definitely needs to negotiate infidelity as well, especially because that will generate her man's competitive nature. The more lovers the woman has, the more attraction the man will have for his partner."" But how do women -- and men for that matter -- get past those ingrained feelings of possessiveness and jealousy? ""Women need to remember the difference between why women and men have sex,"" she says. ""Women tend to value intimacy. For men it's often the thrill of the chase, or the quick sex with a stranger. Men don't even have to know their lovers' names! It's often just a cheap thrill and has nothing to do with us as a loving girlfriend or wife. Once we understand that, it's much easier to let him go off."" But Josephs doesn't think understanding will overcome jealousy. ""I think what's universal is that no one likes sharing partners -- whether you're male or female. I think jealousy is a kind of universal emotion,"" the professor said. Her sugarbabe days now over, Hill lets her boyfriend of two years, Phil Dean ""go off"" on occasion. Hill says she believes negotiating their infidelity has been instrumental in keeping their relationship strong and committed, not to mention electric. ""[Dean] can have sex with the Australian women's basketball team for all I care, but he can't spoon any of them,"" says Hill. ""For me, spooning is cheating."" Dean, 45, who works for an insurance company in Sydney, jokes that he hasn't slept with any members of the Australian basketball team. But he is a big supporter of negotiated infidelity. ""I was actually very relieved when Holly and I started to speak about it [at the beginning of the relationship],"" he says. ""She asked me if I'd be happy in a monogamous long-term relationship and I had to say 'no'."" And while Dean says he doesn't get jealous when Holly spends time with another lover, some of his male friends are certainly jealous of his relationship's flexibility. ""Some think it couldn't get any better than what I have,"" says Dean. ""Some, however, don't want to embrace the concept. They feel protective of their partner and don't want to share."" Central to the idea of negotiated infidelity, Hill says, is each couple figuring out what their boundaries are. While she admits she shed a few tears at the start of her relationship as she and Dean tested their comfort levels with different arrangements (Dean also says it has definitely been a learning process), they're now very clear about what they will and won't allow. While Dean has the green light to have sex with other women, he's not permitted to stay overnight. He also can't take his lovers away for romantic weekends. And Hill says she'll have an all-out hissy fit if he spoons another woman. Hill, on the other hand, is allowed to spoon her lovers because Dean has no problem with that and recognizes that intimacy is an important part of sex for women. Hill isn't, however, allowed to wear any of the outfits Dean has bought for her when she meets up with a lover. But how can Hill be sure Dean isn't spooning if she isn't there? ""If you're talking about sexual needs honestly with your partner, you get better at communicating with each other, you get better with honesty,"" says Hill. ""Everything is out in the open and you have an honest relationship according to your man's biology, not according to some outdated social norms."" (Hill is working on another book that will address why women also like to venture outside their marriages for sex.) Those rules sound artificial to Marcella Weiner, adjunct professor of  Marymount Manhattan College and author of ""Repairing Your Marriage After His Affair: A Woman's Guide to Hope and Healing."" ""Unless you're totally dead inside of you and have no heart or no brains or no anything -- when you're with another person, you're with another person,"" said Weiner. ""It's not just here's my penis, here's your vagina that's it. It is for some people -- but that's a mechanical kind of thing."" While it may not be for everyone, Hill is optimistic that if more people embraced the idea of negotiated infidelity, cheating could become a thing of the past, leading to fewer divorces and truly happy lifelong relationships. ""We just have to be honest about the way nature created us, and we have to work with nature instead of working against her. This isn't rocket science. This is what every man already knows and I think what every woman deep down already knows.""","Author Holly Hill says women should negotiate infidelity with their husbands .

"(CNN) -- A Texas teacher has been ""suspended without pay pending discharge"" after accusations that she sent racially charged tweets about the incidents in Ferguson, Missouri, a representative for the Duncanville Independent School District said at a press conference. Vinita Hegwood, a high school English teacher at Duncanville High School near Dallas, allegedly sent the tweets from her personal Twitter account Friday. ""Who the (expletive) made you dumb (expletive) crackers think I give a squat (expletive) about your opinions. #Ferguson Kill yourselves,"" read one of the messages. Later that evening another tweet appeared, saying, ""You exhibit nigga behavior, I'm a call you a nigga. You acting crackerish, I'm a call you a cracker."" Hegwood is African-American. Gov. Jay Nixon: Protest violence ""cannot be repeated"" It's not clear exactly to what or whom she was referring, but the protests in Ferguson, Missouri, have often hinged on race, as Michael Brown was a black teen killed by Officer Darren Wilson, a white policeman. A grand jury is expected to decide soon whether Wilson will face charges. Hegwood is in her second year at Duncanville High School, where she maintained a website for her students, www.englishandelephants.com. The Twitter account from which she allegedly made the comments has since been taken down. Hegwood did not immediately respond to CNN's calls and emails seeking comment. Lari Barager, Duncanville Independent School District spokeswoman, called the messages ""offensive"" and ""reprehensible"" and stressed the tweets do not represent the 240 other teachers at Duncanville High School. The swiftness and severity with which administrators acted demonstrate how seriously they view the incident, Barager said. It's rare to be suspended without pay, the fullest disciplinary action allowed under district policy, she said. Hegwood began meeting with administrators Monday at 7:15 a.m. By 8:30 a.m., ""there was a conclusion and this decision had been made,"" Barager said. District employees do have the right to free speech, Barager said, but Hegwood's comments were so egregious, the school was left with ""no other option."" The board of trustees for the school district will decide Hegwood's fate at its next meeting on December 8. Hegwood's tweets are the latest example of the percolating tensions and controversy that have spread beyond the Ferguson city limits in the aftermath of the Brown shooting. In September, Ralph Weems, a Marine and Iraq war veteran, was severely beaten in a Mississippi restaurant parking lot. Weems, who is white, allegedly left a Waffle House after he was told it wasn't safe there for white people because patrons inside were upset about the Ferguson situation. Weems left and was apparently followed to a Huddle House, where he was attacked. He continues to recover, but struggles with long-term memory loss, according to a GoFundMe page set up to help pay for his medical expenses. In another incident, the Missouri State University newspaper staff printed racially charged language on the cover of its paper following a black equality protest two weeks before the school's October homecoming game. The quotes, which included the f-word and racial slurs that were hurled at the protesters and ""Go back to Ferguson!"" were allegedly shouted to protesters by other students. The staff said it wanted to highlight the abuse the protesters received. Also, a mother and daughter were arrested during another October protest at a St. Louis Rams football game after allegedly spitting on and punching fans during a clash.

"(CNN) -- Louisiana Republican Governor Bobby Jindal hasn't announced another run for office -- but his large campaign spending since winning re-election in 2011 suggests he still has some political ambitions in mind. Jindal's campaign spending totaled $1.8 million in 2013, according to analysis from New Orleans paper The Times-Picayune published Tuesday, and said that was more than any other politician in the state for that year. He spent more than $152,600 in 2012 and 2013 for flights to New Hampshire, Iowa and South Carolina -- lynchpin states that nearly all potential presidential candidates visit to swing votes in their favor. Fees for consultants and hotels, however, remained consistent when compared to the amount he spent in 2011 when he was campaigning for governor in Louisiana. Jindal has been one of a growing list of GOP governors who could run for president in 2016. Timmy Teepell, an adviser to Jindal who formerly served as the governor's chief of staff, confirmed that the reported spending numbers were accurate, but said a closer look at Jindal's expenses shows nothing unusual. ""All of it wasn't spent on travel or what not,"" Teepell said, pointing out that about $600,000 was spent on a public awareness campaign after Jindal's education reform policies elicited a lawsuit from the Department of Justice. At the time, funds were used to rally constituent support for Jindal's program, an effort that falls squarely within the legal ramifications of campaign spending. ""Bobby is the governor. He's trying to advance policy goals. Spending money to help him accomplish those policy goals is officeholder expenses,"" Teepell said. His firm, OnMessage is among the consultants who has received payments from Jindal's campaign, according to The Times-Picayune. The Jindal adviser also said some of Jindal's out-of-state travel is, in part, attributable to cross-country speaking engagements during his time as chairman of the Republican Governors Association in 2013. It's a position eyed by presidential hopefuls. The RGA's top slot has been held by other potential 2016 contenders including Texas governor Rick Perry, and is currently maintained by New Jersey governor Chris Christie. For months, pundits have speculated about Jindal's potential 2016 presidential run. The governor himself has joked about the irony of his busy travel schedule despite a lack of a formal campaign announcement. ""Now, some people have asked me if I intend to run for president in 2016,"" he said in a speech May 2013. ""And the answer is that I have no plans to run. I've made that clear, over and over again, in Iowa, in New Hampshire and in South Carolina."" The governor, who is legally prohibited to run for a third term as Louisiana's top leader, has said in the past he won't make a decision until after December.","The Times-Picayune of New Orleans reported Jindal spent $1.8 million in 2013 on campaigns .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Transportation Security Administration on Wednesday abandoned plans to allow small knives and certain other banned items back on passenger flights, surrendering to fierce criticism from airlines, unions and Congress. In a statement, the TSA said it would continue to enforce the ""current prohibited items list,"" which does not permit small knives. The TSA first announced the plan to allow small knives and sporting equipment in March, saying doing so would permit airport screeners extra time to focus on more dangerous objects like bombs and related components. The change would also have brought the United States into alignment with rules governing flights in most other countries, he said. Aviation safety experts said small knives and sports equipment present little threat to aircraft, largely because of the reinforced cockpit doors. Authorities say terrorists continue to plot against airlines. But the threat response has shifted away from any effort to take control of a plane, like the 9/11 hijackers did, as carriers have hardened cockpits and beefed up on board and ground security. Knives are among the most common items surrendered by passengers at screening points at U.S. airports, figures show. But aviation safety experts say small knives and sports equipment present little threat to aircraft. The emphasis now is on detecting bombs. TSA Administrator John Pistole previously said ""our greatest concern, the greatest risk"" is non-metalic improvised explosive devices, or IEDs. ""That's what I want our security officers to focus on,"" he said. But his effort to roll back the small knife ban to allow unfixed blades no longer than 2.36 inches and less than a half-inch wide was met with sharp and sustained criticism from big airlines. Groups representing flight attendants, pilots, and airport screeners also were not convinced that the security situation warranted a change. Numerous members of Congress balked at the plan as well, some promising to fight it legislatively. TSA pulled back three days before the change was to take effect in April, saying it wanted to consult with key groups before moving forward. TSA officially abandoned the effort on Wednesday. ""TSA strongly values the input of our partners and traveling public and appreciates the varying points of view shared throughout the review process,"" it said in its statement. It made the final decision ""after extensive engagement"" with aviation advisers, law enforcement officials, and passenger advocates, the agency said. Some Pistole supporters, including former TSA chief Kip Hawley, argued the knife ban actually endangers passengers by re-focusing the attention of airport screeners away from bigger threats. But that opinion held little sway with flight attendants, who said they would be ""sitting ducks"" for any passenger armed with weapons. ""We promised 'no knives on planes ever again' and today that promise was kept,"" the Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions said in a statement. It commended the agency for revising its plans. ""The result is better security policy and the assurance that our nation's aviation security system continues to be vigilant for knives that could be used in a terrorist attack or criminal act against passengers or crew,"" the group that represents 90,000 flight attendants said. The TSA has made numerous changes to its list of prohibiting items over the years. It now permits small screwdrivers, small scissors, cigarette lighters and matches, and bans large quantities of liquids and gels. Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the top Democrat on the House Homeland Security Committee, applauded the TSA decision. ""When established processes for creating policy are followed, common sense prevails,"" he said.","TSA sought to relax rules banning small knives on commercial flights .

"(CNN) -- Swiss tennis star Martina Hingis is still finding mother knows best at the age of 33. Coached for much of her career by her mom Melanie Molitor -- said to have named her daughter after another tennis icon, Martina Navratilova -- the five-time grand slam champion is using her mother's advice both on and off the court. Hingis conjured some of her old tennis nous to surprisingly win the Sony Open doubles title alongside German Sabine Lisicki in Miami last month. But the doubles victory was just a diversion for Hingis, who is also borrowing some inspiration from her mom with a blossoming career as a tennis coach. ""I think a lot more about my mum now,"" Hingis tells CNN's Open Court with a flash of her trademark smile. ""It's never easy to coach anybody. She's the best. She really helps to coach and to mentor. She has so much more experience."" Hingis is presiding over a brood of young players on the clay courts of her new tennis center at Barcelona's Real Club de Polo. As the juniors run drills round the red clay, her mom drops in to lend a hand and is soon on court with a pile of tennis balls heaped onto her racquet, ready for business. ""The goal is to grow slowly,"" says Hingis of the new project, which she started in collaboration with former top-10 player Felix Mantilla and Karim Perona, who coaches Tommy Robredo and Flavia Pennetta. ""It's a small, elite group of pros but in the future we want to work with kids, amateurs, veterans all the players. Anyone who wants to come here and learn is welcome."" Hingis' caliber as a coach is growing. She has worked with Russian world No.25 Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and is now coaching the 2013 Wimbledon finalist Lisicki. In fact it was Lisicki's idea to get Hingis to double up her role as coach and playing partner. ""I was practicing with Sabine and coaching her when she asked about playing doubles,"" Hingis explained. ""I was like 'wow, that's a bit unexpected' but we talked about it last year at Wimbledon when she did so well. It's nice that I can be the coach and playing partner of Sabine, it's kind of killing two flies with the same thing! ""To win an event like this after a seven-year absence I didn't expect it! Standing there as a champion again was a really nice feeling. You feel invincible again when you win. ""I really enjoy the competition but I definitely wouldn't do it if I got knocked out in the first or second round again."" Young champ . Hingis is understandably wary about making a habit of a comeback on the court. A glittering early career saw a 16-year-old Hingis set records as the youngest world No.1 and, when she won the 1997 Australian Open, as the youngest player to win a grand slam in the 20th Century. After two more wins in Australia and the Wimbledon and U.S. Open crowns -- as well as nine grand slam doubles titles -- the ""Swiss Miss"" retired from tennis in 2002, plagued with injuries at the age of 22. Four years later, Hingis returned to win a first mixed doubles title at the Australian Open and six more singles titles, only to retire again at the end of 2007. ""Playing and winning was normal and natural,"" reflected Hingis, who returned to play doubles with Daniela Hantuchova for a brief spell last season. ""You didn't have time to enjoy the moment because there was always the next tournament, the next challenge, the next opponent. ""I have more time now to enjoy it and look back at the memories. When they talk through my career I think 'oh yeah I wasn't so bad!' ""Everything I achieved as a 16, 17, and 18-year-old teenager, I was going through all these difficult times, rebellion and I still have all these unbelievable victories, so I don't have any regrets."" Even in the twilight of her career, Hingis' deft, tactical game may still be capable of winning trophies but she is also learning that there is success to savor with a seat in the players' box too. ""When a player improves, does the right thing that I'm asking for, it's like a small victory,"" Hingis said. ""It's a challenge to make the players better. Everything that I do now it's a lot more thought through. ""Now I try and learn as teacher, as a coach, it's like learning again."" Horse play . Tennis has not only brought Hingis full circle, and closer to her mother through coaching, it has also helped fuel her passion away from game. ""I got my first horse when I was 14 and I bought her with my first prize money,"" explained Hingis, an accomplished equestrian. ""It was something that I had for myself and didn't have to be perfect at! With tennis you have to put it in the white lines and you want to win matches but with horses I didn't have the same pressure. ""Tennis was my job, horses were my passion and I wanted to keep it that way."" Her current steed is now stabled at Barcelona's polo club alongside the 40 courts of her new tennis center. Under Barcelona's brilliant blue skies, it seems Hingis has found the perfect balance between work and pleasure. Is Belinda Bencic the next Martina Hingis?

"(CNN) -- Ebola is not a death sentence. That is the lesson to the world from the release this week of Dr. Craig Spencer from a hospital in New York. Less than three weeks ago, Spencer was diagnosed with Ebola and admitted to Bellevue Hospital in New York. On Tuesday, he walked out, free of the virus. Spencer had been treating Ebola patients in Guinea. He knew he was risking his life. But he also knew that, given proper care, people can survive this disease. Indeed, eight of the nine people treated for Ebola in the United States have returned home safely to their families. That's the good news: Health care can make a difference. In, Africa, however, too many Ebola patients are dying from the disease, nearly 5,000 from the about 13,500 cases that have been reported. Yet we can dramatically reduce this rate and ensure the disease is not spread. The strategy for containing and ending the outbreak in West Africa, and for preventing worldwide spread, requires an army of courageous health care workers and community volunteers like Spencer to join those from within the affected countries, those who already are making a difference on the Ebola front lines throughout Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. When Spencer was admitted to Bellevue, the situation in these countries looked bleak. Today, there are reasons for optimism that the Ebola outbreak can and will be brought under control. While transmission continues to outpace the response, we are also seeing that, where people receive care, and where communities embrace safe burial and other practices that reduce infection, the rate of transmission may be slowing. As a result, we are potentially seeing the curve bending -- not everywhere, but in enough places to give us reason for hope. Over the past several weeks the international community across Africa and around the world has mobilized to provide assistance. From governments and aid organizations to foundations and the private sector, the world's leaders are stepping up. But much more is needed, especially medical personnel to work in Ebola treatment units and others to train West Africans who are volunteering to work in their own communities. Several governments and nongovernmental organizations from Africa and around the world have stepped up to provide skilled health care workers, but many more will need to join them to complete the task. The Global Ebola Response Coalition, coordinated by the United Nations, has a clear strategy: By December 1, isolating and treating 70% of all Ebola cases and providing safe and dignified burials to 70% of those who have died. By the end of the year, we aim to establish Ebola-free zones. The next goal will be zero cases of Ebola in Africa and everywhere. That is the only way to avoid a resurgence and prevent Ebola from spreading across borders. We will also need to provide sustained support to the affected countries. The outbreak has had a significant impact on health care, with people unable or afraid to access essential services such as maternal care, measles vaccinations and treatment for malaria. Many schools are closed, food prices have risen by nearly 25% and trade has suffered. We must work to ensure such an outbreak never happens again. That means investing in infrastructure, education and public health in developing countries, learning the lessons of Ebola and making sure communities are less susceptible and that global early warning and response systems for outbreaks are more robust. We must prepare for the worst so it never happens. Ebola has caused inestimable suffering and havoc in West Africa. But the story of Dr. Craig Spencer and the others who have been cured with adequate health care is that Ebola can be beaten. Let us celebrate the health care heroes in Africa and show global solidarity so the people of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone can return to the path of progress that they were on before the Ebola crisis. Thank you, Dr Spencer, for the care you gave. Thanks to those who have cared for you. And thanks to those who have cared for the thousands of others who have recovered. Thanks for what you have given and continue to give. We owe you all so much.","Almost 5,000 people have died in current Ebola outbreak, David Nabarro says .

"Boston, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Aijalon Mahli Gomes, the U.S. citizen sentenced to eight years of hard labor for crossing over the Chinese border into North Korea, arrived home Friday afternoon with the man who secured his freedom, former President Jimmy Carter. Gomes' family rushed toward the steps of the private plane, wiping tears from their eyes and hugging the man imprisoned in communist North Korea since January. ""Thank you President Carter for traveling to North Korea to bring Aijalon home,"" the family said in a statement. ""For Aijalon, although returning home, the journey toward healing really just begins today."" Relatives later spoke to reporters outside the family home about the release. Relatives said Gomes looked well physically. ""We are greatly pleased and thankful for [his] coming home,"" said Gomes' uncle, Michael Farrow. ""We are thankful for all the prayers and God most of all."" Gomes' younger brother, Milton McCarthy Jr., 19, said, ""It's an overwhelming amount of joy and happiness. It's a prayer being answered."" Carter did not make any comments about his trip, which was surrounded by speculation on whether the former president had met with the reclusive North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. Carter has a history of helping thaw frigid Pyongyang-Washington relations. North Korea sentenced Gomes, 31, to hard labor and a fine of about $600,000 for illegally crossing its border with China and for an unspecified ""hostile act.""  Gomes is believed to be a Christian activist. ""At the request of President Carter, and for humanitarian purposes, Mr. Gomes was granted amnesty by the chairman of the National Defense Commission, Kim Jong Il,"" said a statement from the Carter Center in Atlanta, Georgia. Farrow said Gomes, who had been living in South Korea for about nine years, was last home at Christmas. Farrow said he didn't know the circumstances surrounding Gomes' entry into North Korea. ""That's not in his character,"" Farrow said. ""He did not take things to the extreme. He may have just been trying to peek in and help others and teach them. He had good motives. I know he had good intentions."" Nor does the family believe that Gomes tried to commit suicide, as suggested by North Korean reports, Farrow said. ""He's a spiritual person,"" Farrow said about his nephew. ""Perhaps he got sick, his body shut down."" The U.S. State Department and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon welcomed Gomes' release. ""We ... are relieved that he will soon be safely reunited with his family,"" said department spokesman P.J. Crowley.  ""We appreciate former President Carter's humanitarian effort and welcome North Korea's decision to grant Mr. Gomes special amnesty and allow him to return to the United States."" He added, ""The U.S. and North Korea do not have diplomatic relations and, as the case of Mr. Gomes illustrates, travel to North Korea is not routine or risk-free."" Ban commended Carter and said he ""appreciates the decision"" of North Korea to release . Gomes on ""humanitarian considerations."" Two American journalists -- Laura Ling and Euna Lee, who had crossed the border into North Korea in March 2009 and were arrested and sentenced to 12 years hard labor -- were released in August 2009 after an intervention by former U.S. President Bill Clinton. Carter arrived in North Korea's capital, Pyongyang, Wednesday on a humanitarian mission to negotiate the release of Gomes. His visit was a private mission, and was not endorsed by the Obama administration. Carter was greeted by Kim Gye Gwan, North Korea's chief negotiator at the six-party nuclear talks, and he also met the country's titular head of state, Kim Jong Nam, according to state-run media in North Korea. ""Jimmy Carter made an apology to Kim Yong Nam for American Gomes' illegal entry into [North Korea] and gave him the assurance that such case will never happen again,"" the Korean Central News Agency reported Friday. KCNA also reported that Kim told Carter that North Korea wants to resume the six-party talks and work toward the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. Carter's 1994 talks with the late Kim Il Sung, Kim Jong Il's father, paved the way for the ""Agreed Framework"" the same year, an agreement designed to rein in Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions. Gomes didn't have only Carter as an advocate. Florida-based attorney Michael Cavendish, who doesn't know Gomes, started a letter-writing campaign when he learned about Gomes' sentencing in April. Some of his letters criticized the U.S. government, which he argued initially did not do enough to advocate for Gomes. ""Over the past four months, there were times when it seemed pointless to write another letter, to make another phone call, to talk to anybody about it at all, because the world is vast and there were all kinds of other stories going on that were sucking up people's attention. And things between the United States and North Korea and its allies were very, very grim,"" Cavendish said early Friday. ""I'm just tremendously happy that he's been set free,"" Cavendish said. CNN's Catherine Shoichet and Susan Candiotti and journalist Andrew Salmon contributed to this report.","Aijalon Mahli Gomes lands on American soil after months in a North Korean jail .

"(CNN) -- TV's Dr. Mehmet Oz attempted to offer more than just health guidance on a busy street in Manhattan on Tuesday morning after a taxi jumped a curb and hit a pedestrian and a cyclist. The accident happened at 49th Street and Sixth Avenue -- home to Rockefeller Center and near Radio City Music Hall and Saks Fifth Avenue -- around 11 a.m. A British tourist was struck and her right leg was severed above her foot and below the knee, according to New York City police. She was sent to Bellevue Hospital, where she was undergoing surgery to try to reattach her right leg, police said. A bicyclist was also struck but was treated at the scene. Police said the incident seemed like an accident. Oz, the host of ""The Dr. Oz Show,"" was getting ready for a shoot when he and his team heard emergency vehicles rushing to the scene, according to Tim Sullivan, representative of the Dr. Oz show. Their offices are about a block away from the accident. Dick Van Dyke helped from burning car . Oz and students from the medical staff on the show ran to the accident, but by the time they arrived, paramedics were already on the scene assisting the injured tourist, according to Sullivan. A good Samaritan walking by was able to use his belt as a tourniquet until paramedics arrived, according to Sullivan. ""David Justino, a plumber from New York, took action, removing his belt and using it as a tourniquet,"" Oz said in a Facebook post. ""My prayers are with the victim for a speedy recovery."" He posted a photo of himself and Justino on Facebook. Oz told CNN affiliate PIX11 that when he arrived, the belt had been tied to the woman's leg and he was just trying to tighten it to stop the bleeding. The cab driver was in a daze and very emotional, Oz said. Another good Samaritan, Max Crespo, a pizza truck owner, put the woman's amputated leg in a bucket of ice until paramedics arrived, according to WCBS.

"Washington (CNN) -- Alaska's Senate race is an increasingly prime pickup opportunity for Republicans, with Democratic Sen. Mark Begich trailing challenger Dan Sullivan by 6 percentage points, a new CNN/ORC International Poll shows. Sullivan earned 50% support compared to 44% for Begich, according to the survey of 704 likely voters that was conducted October 1-6. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.5 points. The race is key for Republicans who hope to gain control of the Senate by capturing at least six seats currently held by Democrats. It looks increasingly important as Democrats pump resources into states like Kansas and South Dakota that weeks ago looked like GOP locks. Hampering Begich are underwater favorability ratings, with 45% of those surveyed offering a positive opinion of the first-term senator and 52% saying they view him unfavorably. Sullivan, meanwhile, is viewed favorably by 53% of Alaska's likely voters, while 41% say they have unfavorable opinions of the former state attorney general and current commissioner of the Department of Natural Resources. Sullivan leads Begich 50% to 45% in Anchorage, the city Begich previously led for two terms as mayor. Complete midterm election coverage . Perhaps more daunting for Begich: Unlike most Democrats, he fares no better among women (44%) than he does men (45%). ""Begich is losing on his home turf, and he is not winning among women, a weakness that few Democrats can overcome on Election Day,"" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. Republicans could gain a Senate seat, but they look just as likely to lose the governor's office. Independent Bill Walker looks positioned to knock off incumbent Republican Gov. Sean Parnell, leading 51% to 45% among likely voters -- with no Democratic candidate in the race to split the anti-Parnell votes. The party's nominee, Byron Mallott, dropped out to become Walker's running mate. Senate math seems impossible to some Democrats .","Democratic Sen.

"(CNN) -- Liang Chao was a typical farmer's son who migrated to the city seeking a better life. He seemed to have found it in Shenzhen, a booming city in southern China, where he worked at Foxconn, a company better known for producing components for Apple, Dell, Hewlett-Packard and other companies. But the 21-year-old worker was found dead on May 14 after falling from the seventh floor of a factory dormitory, according to local police. Liang's death was the ninth in a spate of similar incidents in which Foxconn employees have fallen to their deaths from buildings. Shenzhen police are treating the cases as suicides. Liu Kun, a spokesman for the Taiwanese-owned Foxconn, said: ""According to the police, most of the nine employees were suffering from personal problems related to emotions or health."" A few days after Liang's death, another Foxconn employee died after falling from a building at the Shenzhen factory complex. In all, state-run media reports there have been 10 deaths and two failed suicide attempts over the past five months. These incidents, widely reported by the Chinese media, have raised questions about the plight of migrant workers and the pressures they endure living and working in big cities. Foxconn is one of the world's top electronics manufacturers. Of its 800,000 employees in China's mainland, 420,000 are in Shenzhen, where they work in shifts and live in the sprawling factory complex. Right now, there are no concrete answers as to what drove the workers to commit suicide. Foxconn insists that its workers are treated well and there could be a number of factors at play. Liu said the company is analyzing the mindset of their employees to try and get to the root of the problem. ""It's true our employees basically stay at the same place 24 hours a day, seven days a week,"" he said. ""We also find some young employees don't know their roommates' names and don't communicate with each other. Some prefer recreational activities using mobile phones or computers instead of taking part in traditional pastimes. Many of our workers come from rural areas and to adjust to life in the city becomes another challenge to them."" China has witnessed dramatic changes since the late statesman Deng Xiaoping launched his reform and open-door program in 1978. Over the past 30 years, in a population shift that resembles the 19th century Industrial Revolution in Europe, millions of farmers have moved away from the land into the cities. Some have found jobs in small towns, working in local industries that range from coal mining to poultry raising. Others have surged into cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, where they take jobs in factories, shops and restaurants. As of last year, an estimated 150 million farmers have moved from farming to non-farming jobs, joining what is called ""liudong renkou,"" or floating population of rural migrants. This in-migration has helped lift more than 300 million Chinese out of abject poverty. It has also brought prosperity in the cities, where a robust middle class and a legion of millionaires have emerged. But as with any radical change, China's reform has its losers as well as winners. The massive economic advance has produced unintended consequences, including growing income gaps and social malaise. ""We have a lot of very poor people and very few rich people,"" said Xu Haoyuan, a psychotherapist in Beijing. ""There is a lot of resentment."" Many migrants, far from home and family, can also feel alienated and often don't have ready access to counseling, experts said. Foxconn said it is taking measures to improve its workers' lives, organizing recreational activities, calling in Buddhist monks to offer spiritual consolation and setting up a 24-hour help line. Liu said the line's logs show it has helped prevent more than 30 suicides in the past month. ""Most cases involved emotional affairs, personal reasons or poverty of the family,"" Liu said. ""Some got depressed because their supervisors scolded them."" Liu said the company was overwhelmed because counselors were scarce. ""Foxconn has never seen anything like this in the past 20 years of operating in the mainland,"" he said. Xu, who also teaches psychology in a privately run college in Beijing, attributes some of the behavior to societal changes in post-Mao China. ""When Western countries turned to the market economy, they still had a strong sense of religion and a strong belief system. Not in China. Over the centuries, this was stamped out. Chairman Mao dumped Confucius during the Cultural Revolution. After Mao died, people dumped his ideas. So the ideology is all messed up; there is no belief system out there. People behave badly."" Xu said that some people follow a new mantra. ""It's 'rou ruo qiang shi' -- the weak are bound to be eaten by the strong,"" she said. ""That's worse than 'survival of the fittest'."" Xu and social workers say that in some extreme cases, people can lash out and hurt themselves or others around them. They worry about the recent spate of bloody attacks on school children. In rural Shaanxi on May 11, a 48-year-old man wielding a kitchen cleaver charged into a kindergarten and hacked to death seven children and two women. He then committed suicide. The incident followed several multiple killings in recent weeks -- five of them occurring at schools, taking the lives of 17 people, including 15 children. In the first official reaction to the spate of school attacks, Premier Wen Jiabao told Hong Kong's Phoenix TV: ""Aside from taking strong security measures, we must also strive to solve the underlying causes that led to these problems. We are making serious efforts in tackling social tensions, settling disputes and improving the government's ability to smooth things out."" Sociologists and psychologists are searching for answers. Some blame poor mental health care in China. According to a report from the Beijing Suicide Research and Prevention Center, China had 173 million adults suffering from mental illness in 2005, with some 91 percent of them -- about 158 million -- never receiving professional help. ""There are too few qualified professionals, even in big hospitals, and there is no community-based mental health counseling,"" Xu said. ""People who are mentally ill do not realize they are ill; their friends and relatives don't know, so when they act up, everybody is surprised."" As with the Foxconn employee deaths, Xu said the attacks against students could indicate that people with problems may feel they have nowhere to turn for help. May Lam, assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Hong Kong, agreed that finding an outlet for concerns can be difficult. ""In China, it's highly controlled and people might have difficulty expressing their views,"" Lam said. ""Demonstrations are not encouraged so people find it difficult to find channels to lodge their complaints and air their views and grievances,""","String of apparent suicides has occurred at Taiwanese-owned Foxconn plant .

"(CNN) -- They say the longest journey starts with a single step. But with ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,"" the first in a trilogy adapted from J.R.R. Tolkien's first novel, Peter Jackson has taken a different approach: He's gone two steps forward and three steps back. In the process he's undoubtedly made himself a whole lot richer. ""The Hobbit"" is dominating screen space across the globe this weekend, and will certainly be among the biggest moneymakers of the year. But he's also jeopardized the legacy of his own ""Lord of the Rings."" Fans won't want to hear it, but ""An Unexpected Journey"" is a major comedown, a muddle-headed and cumbersome piece of filmmaking that betrays Jackson's mercenary motives -- Tolkien's book, too. ""The Hobbit"" is far lighter work than what followed, and at approximately 350 pages, hardly crying out for the 10-hour magnum opus treatment (but three films are so much more profitable than one!) For fans, 'Hobbit' is a family reunion . In just shy of three hours, ""An Unexpected Journey"" takes the story up to chapter seven -- about 140 pages in my paperback edition. Jackson has shown his elephantine tendencies before, in the bloated and indulgent extended editions of the ""Rings"" films. But in the earlier trilogy -- which I admired and enjoyed, incidentally -- he clearly showed he had the measure of the material and understood both Tolkien's moral convictions and the books' darker forebodings of impending death and destruction. Even if it's something of a dry run for Frodo's odyssey, ""The Hobbit"" is a different beast. There's so much less at stake in the story of Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) joining Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and a band of dwarves in a raid on a dragon's mountainous lair. This is an adventure story, a caper with elves and goblins. And yet Jackson gives it the same portentous, heroic swagger; the same doomy menaces. It's just that this time the action is spooned out in thimbles. The rest of the running time is given over to dwarfish humor, endless, unfunny comic bluster and banter interspersed with duff warrior dirges and desperate close-ups of Freeman mugging. ""Sluggish"" doesn't begin to do justice to the way Jackson has padded out his narrative. But there's worse, far worse, for anyone tempted to check out the movie in its 3-D, 48 frames per second incarnation (showcased in approximately 450 premium screens across North America). The theory behind this cutting edge technology -- which doubles the 24 fps that has been standard in movies since the silent era -- is that the faster frame rate allows more luminescence, counterbalancing the loss incurred in 3-D. It's clearer, brighter and more immersive -- in theory. In practice, it's clearer, brighter, and utterly alienating. I haven't seen the movie screened at 24 fps, but at 48, the grain of film has been replaced by the gloss of high definition video, which gives everything and everyone a fake, plastic sheen. ""An Unexpected Journey"" may look sharp in TV showrooms or on your PS3, but in the movie theater the picture's clarity comes at the loss of texture, shading and consistency. Shifts from exteriors to dark interiors are especially jarring. Look also at the dull, flat orange taint that is meant to approximate candle light in numerous scenes, and compare that with the glow you find in ""Barry Lyndon,"" or ""Fanny and Alexander,"" or your own birthday snaps. Did Jackson embrace 48 fps to keep himself interested, because he knew he was retreading old ground? Is he really blind to the limitations of this technology at this stage of its evolution? I won't say it has no future, but for now this emperor has no clothes. It's a colossal misjudgment. He's put his name to the ugliest film of the year, a $270 million three-hour epic that looks like a TV show (""Teletubbies"" was the first to pop into my head, and ""Doctor Who"" was the most flattering comparison I could come up with.) In fairness, there are redeeming features: The movie does sputter into life in the last 45 minutes, especially during a lengthy battle of wits between Bilbo and Gollum. And Ian McKellen miraculously, alone among the cast, transcends the picture's artificial surface and imposes himself on such drama as he can find. In my book that's not enough return for three hours at the movies, or whatever inflated price they're charging for your ticket now.","""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is the first in a trilogy adapted from Tolkien's first novel .

"(CNN) -- The incredible discovery of the Higgs boson will open up new ways of probing the part of the universe that is invisible to our everyday senses: beyond ordinary matter, into the extraordinary world of dark matter. It isn't often that you get to be physically present at an historic occasion, but I was at CERN on July 4 when scientists at the Large Hadron Collider announced the discovery of the Higgs boson particle. Hundreds of young physicists had camped out from the previous night just to get good seats at the technical seminars proclaiming the discovery. What we witnessed was the first solid evidence for the particle that explains how other particles like electrons and quarks get to be massive. Part of the excitement stems from the fact that the Higgs boson is the final piece in an extremely elaborate puzzle: the Standard Model of particle physics. This boringly named theory has loomed triumphantly over physics for the past 40 years, withstanding all experimental challenges. With this final piece in place, we can justifiably say that we understand the behavior of ordinary matter -- the atoms and molecules that make up ourselves and our everyday world. Much more of the excitement, however, had a deeper basis: if the Higgs is the final chapter in one story, it's also the prologue to our next adventure. This is true literally as well as figuratively. See also: What is the Higgs boson and why is it important? As successful as the Standard Model has been, we know it's not the final answer to how the universe works. Strong evidence comes from the existence of dark matter: mysterious, invisible stuff that adds up to five times as much mass as the ordinary atoms and particles in the universe. We know enough about dark matter to be sure that it's not just some kind of ordinary matter that is hiding in the shadows. It is something truly new, something we haven't yet directly seen here on Earth. But we're trying. Multiple experiments are underway to look for the dark matter particles we think are all around us. Not only are they ""dark,"" these particles hardly interact with ordinary matter at all. It's possible, even likely, that millions of them pass through your body every second. It's like a city with two populations, each speaking a different language, and no translators or bilingual interpreters. The two groups of people go about their separate lives, never directly speaking with each other. Likewise, in our galaxy, dark matter and ordinary matter pass right through each other all the time. The Higgs boson could be the bilingual particle we've been looking for. We don't know exactly what the dark matter is, but we certainly have our favorite theories. In many of those models, the Higgs is the one particle that readily interacts both with ordinary protons and neutrons and also with dark matter. See also: The woman at the edge of physics . There are several experiments currently running with the goal of detecting dark matter. Typically they are deep underground, shielded from cosmic rays and other sources of noise, kept in environments that are as quiet as possible. Dark matter particles are able to penetrate through the Earth and pass right through the detector. Most do so unmolested, but occasionally we'll get lucky and one will interact with the nucleus of an atom, leaving a bit of energy behind. Our best theoretical guess is that the way that interaction will happen is through the exchange of Higgs bosons. Knowing something about the Higgs will be enormously helpful in figuring out the implications if one of these experiments finds a strong dark-matter signal -- something we're hopeful could happen in the near future. We're not just waiting around for dark matter to be detected, either. Now that we've found the Higgs, we can start studying its properties in detail. How is it made? How does it decay? Are its properties those predicted by the Standard Model, or are there hints of something new going on? If everything breaks just right, we may be able to produce dark matter directly at the Large Hadron Collider. It won't be easy, precisely because dark matter interacts so weakly. Even if you make it, it's hard to be sure, because the antisocial dark matter particles tend to zip out of your experiment without leaving any trace behind. But once we better understand the Higgs and the particles it decays into, we might be able to infer the presence of dark matter just by process of elimination, by pinpointing events in which more energy went into the collision than we detected coming out. Even though it wasn't discovered until 2012, the Higgs boson was proposed back in 1964. It is very much a child of the 20th century. In particle physics and cosmology, the 21st century promises discoveries that will help illuminate the dark universe around us. That's the great thing about history being made: you know things are different now, but you can't be sure where you're going to go next.

"(CNN) -- The history of U.S. sanctions against Iran dates as far back as 1979, when hostages were held at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. Over the years, the U.S. government has approved other sanctions. In 2010, amid increasing tensions of Iran's nuclear program, the United States instituted sanctions that U.S. officials described as ""unprecedented."" The United Nations and the European Union, and other countries around the world also have sanctions against Iran. The following are some key steps in the efforts to sanction Iran. U.S. sanctions: . -- As a result of the hostage crisis in 1979, the U.S. government froze Iranian government assets in the United States and U.S. banks overseas, totaling $12 billion, according to the U.S. Treasury. That freeze was eventually expanded to a full trade embargo until an accord was signed with Iran in 1981. Most assets were unblocked and the embargo was lifted. -- In 1987, the United States imposed a new embargo on Iranian goods and services, ""as a result of Iran's support for international terrorism and its aggressive actions against non-belligerent shipping in the Persian Gulf,"" the U.S. Treasury says. -- In 1995, the United States banned ""involvement with petroleum development in Iran,"" the U.S. Treasury says. Two years later, the United States banned ""virtually all trade and investment activities with Iran by U.S. persons, wherever located."" -- In 2010, the United States passed the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act. It revoked, for example, permission to import ""certain foodstuffs and carpets of Iranian origin,"" the U.S. Treasury says. Those who violated the law could face a fine of up to $1 million and 20 years imprisonment. -- The law established that Iranian goods or services may not be imported unless they are gifts valued $100 or less; informational materials, or personal property of someone coming into the United States. -- U.S. citizens may not export goods or services to Iran or, in general, to a third country knowing it is intended for Iran. There are exceptions for ""donations of articles intended to relieve human suffering,"" gifts valued at $100 or less, certain agricultural products, medicines, and informational materials, the Treasury says. -- The U.S. government prohibits ""servicing accounts of the government of Iran,"" including the country's central bank. -- In 2011, the United States added further sanctions, including tightening restrictions on companies that provide Iran with equipment and expertise to run its oil and chemical industry. It prohibited groups that do business with financial institutions in Iran from holding accounts in the United States. -- U.S. sanctions also targeted groups in Iran -- such as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the Basij Resistance Force, and Iran's Law Enforcement Forces -- as well as several individuals in Iran. U.N. sanctions: . -- Current U.N. sanctions against Iran are the result of a series of resolutions dating back to 2006. -- Material related to Iran's ""proliferation-sensitive nuclear and ballistic missile programs"" are embargoed, the United Nations says. -- One of the resolutions bans the export or procurement ""of any arms and related material from Iran,"" the U.N. Security Council says. -- A long list of individuals and entities are subject to a travel ban and assets freeze. ""The assets freeze also applies to any individuals or entities acting on behalf of, or at the direction of, the designated persons and entities, and to entities owned or controlled by them,"" the council says on its website. EU sanctions: . -- The European Union announced Monday it will ban the import of Iranian crude oil and petroleum products. -- Assets of Iran's central bank in the European Union will be frozen, and trade with Iran in gold, diamonds, and precious metals will be blocked, the union said. -- The export to Iran of ""key"" petrochemical equipment and technology from the European Union will be blocked, the it said. -- The European Union already had in place a series of sanctions as well, targeting the oil and gas industry, nuclear industry, financial sector and more. -- Measures put in place in 2010 include restrictions on ""equipment which might be used for internal repression,"" the official text said.","Most sanctions from the 1979 hostage crisis were lifted after an accord two years later .

"(CNN)  -- When 4-year-old Ethan Stacy was reluctantly sent off to spend the summer with his mother late last month, he was in effect being given a death sentence. The child never had a chance. He was dead within two weeks of arriving at the apartment in Layton, Utah, where his mother lived with her fiancé. What could have been done to save him? ""I don't have a good answer for you,"" Layton police Lt. Garret Atkin, one of many law enforcement officers in Davis County, Utah, who are grieving for the boy who lived among them so briefly, told me. The facts of what happened to Ethan speak for themselves: . He was living with his father, Joe G. Stacy, in Richlands, Virginia. Stacy and his estranged wife, Stephanie, were involved in divorce proceedings. The divorce was being adjudicated in Florida, where they had lived before she moved west. Joe Stacy, in a divorce court filing last November, warned of his fears. His estranged wife was ""unstable,"" he wrote to the court: ""The mother has abandoned the child and I'm afraid the mother will come and take him and I'll never see him again."" But the judge in the divorce case, Maura T. Smith, told The Associated Press that she never read the filing. Judge Smith said that Ethan's parents had worked out a settlement, including shared custody, and that the finalization of their divorce last month was ""cut and dried."" Part of the decree was that Ethan would live with his dad during the school year, and with his mother during the summer. The child reportedly did not want to go to Utah with her. ""I did not want him to go, and he didn't want to go at all,"" Joe Stacy told the Salt Lake Tribune. ""He kept telling me he didn't want to go."" But in late April, the divorce agreement newly in effect, the boy was put on a plane to fly to Utah with his mother. What allegedly happened next is described in affidavits prepared by the Layton Police Department: . Ethan, his mother and her fiancé, Nathan Sloop, began living in their Layton home. On May 5, Nathan Sloop, 31, took the 4-year-old child into a bedroom and began slapping and hitting him on the face and head, police said. Ethan's face began to swell. Police said his mother did not alert anyone or seek medical attention for her son. On May 6, the couple went to the county courthouse in Farmington, Utah, to get married. They did not bring Ethan with them. The reason, according to police, was that they were ""afraid to take him out in public with the swelling and bruising to his face,"" because they thought that if anyone saw Ethan's injuries, they would call authorities. So, police detectives said, they removed the inside doorknob of the bedroom where they left Ethan, so he could not get out. For the next three days, police said, Ethan was vomiting, was lethargic, had a fever, and was not able to eat. His symptoms were consistent with a possible brain injury. Instead of trying to help the child, Nathan Sloop engaged in ""a systematic and progressively more violent pattern of abuse."" But no one knew. Joe Stacy had called his son every day after the child had been sent to Utah, but he told the Salt Lake Tribune that beginning on May 5, his former wife began to make excuses on the phone for why the boy could not talk to him. ""I never did get a call back,"" Stacy told the paper. On May 7, police said, Stephanie Sloop returned home from shopping to find that Ethan had been scalded on his feet, legs and buttocks. Nathan Sloop said the boy had burned himself in the bathtub. Joe Stacy continued to try to call his son, but to no avail. On May 9 -- Mother's Day -- Ethan was found dead in his bed. Police said that Nathan and Stephanie Sloop did not notify anyone, but instead began ""to formulate a plan to dispose of the body and deceive law enforcement."" The couple, according to police, wrapped garbage bags around the child's body and drove to Powder Mountain. Police said Nathan Sloop took a hammer to Ethan's face and teeth, in an effort to make him unrecognizable should anyone ever find him. The boy was then buried. Late the next night, Stephanie Sloop reported the child missing. She told the Layton police that Ethan had walked away from home. Some 40 officers, in foul weather, searched for the child. But before long the Sloops' story began to fall apart. Late on the afternoon of May 11, officers digging in the mud recovered his body. Nathan and Stephanie Sloop are being held in the Davis County Jail. He is being held on suspicion of aggravated murder, felony child abuse, obstruction of justice and desecration of a corpse. She is being held on suspicion of felony child abuse, obstruction of justice and desecration of a corpse. The Davis County prosecutor, Troy Rawlings, told me that he will file formal charges by next Friday, when the Sloops are scheduled to appear in court. The body of Ethan Stacy, who had never wanted to leave his father in the first place, was flown back to Virginia last week. That is where, with summer coming, he was buried, this time with dignity and with love.

"RIYADH, Saudi Arabia  -- Ahmad al Shayea is the rarest of truck bombers -- he survived his suicide mission in Iraq even though the blast from his bomb was strong enough to kill 12 bystanders. Ahmad al Shayea survived his truck bomb attack, but not without scarring to his face and hands. Al Shayea, who was disfigured during the attack, claims al Qaeda tricked him into becoming a bomber by asking him to deliver a tanker truck, which they had rigged with a bomb. ""They told me to take it to an address in Baghdad. As soon as I got there the truck exploded,"" said the native of Saudi Arabia. He survived by jumping out of the truck. Al Shayea renounced terrorism and returned to Saudi Arabia, where he works to convince would-be insurgents and terrorists to give up their deadly ways. ""I think God took me out of death to show others what can happen,"" he told CNN. ""If you join al Qaeda, they will use you, and maybe you will die.""  Hear why al Shayea turned his back on al Qaeda » . Al Qaeda propaganda videos glorify so-called foreign fighters in Iraq like al Shayea. It has recruited them from countries all across the Middle East. Some Iraqi officials say more Saudis than any other nationality have responded to al Qaeda's call. Saudi officials and the U.S. military deny that claim. But Saudi sources do admit that more than 800 young Saudis have gone to Iraq to fight. That's far more than the Saudi government has acknowledged until now. Since 9/11, when 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudis, the oil rich kingdom has been accused of spreading radicalism. It's a claim that stings this longtime U.S. ally, which also finds itself in al Qaeda's cross hairs. So now, Saudi officials say they are escalating their fight against homegrown al Qaeda militants. Former insurgents and terrorists like al Shayea are their chief weapon in the battle for the hearts and minds of young Saudis. ""The reality behind it is the religious misunderstanding of Islam, so we have to correct the ideas,"" said Dr. Turki Al-Otayan, a psychologist. Al Shayea and hundreds of other Saudis who were aligned with terrorists are being re-educated in prisons and rehabilitation centers. They are taught that al Qaeda's emphasis on a violent approach to Islam is wrong. The program offers early release from prison. It's available only to captured jihadis who demonstrate a willingness to change over the course of repeated interviews with specialists. Al Shayea said he was questioned by security forces, then clerics, then psychologists. ""They looked at my mood, listened to me. They were nice,"" he adds. Al-Otayan said the review is thorough. ""We make sure he understands dialogue. We make sure he is not just lying. So it is not an easy job I can assure you,"" he said. The Saudi government says more than 1,000 former al Qaeda recruits have been through the program. Seven hundred of them are now free. Critics, mainly from the country's security forces, fear mistakes could allow some al Qaeda fighters back on the street. A native of Saudi Arabia, al Shayea was just 19 when he went to Iraq to fight for al Qaeda against American forces. He was angered, he said, by scenes of U.S. troops killings his fellow Muslims. ""I went to Iraq with Saudi men because jihad is a duty for every Muslim,"" he said. ""I went to Iraq to fight the jihad and kill Americans."" He was hoping to take up arms against Americans, but said he never envisioned himself as a suicide bomber. After his truck bomb exploded, al Shayea was captured and paraded on Iraqi TV. Burned and bandaged, he was blamed for the death of 12 bystanders. He confessed. Iraqi security officials deported him to Saudi Arabia. Today, with the backing of the Saudi government, al Shayea gets his anti-al Qaeda message out on fliers that include pictures of him before and after his bombing. He has become the anti-Al Qaeda example. ""I learned my lesson, and others will learn as well,"" he said.
