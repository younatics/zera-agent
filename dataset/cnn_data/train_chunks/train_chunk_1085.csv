"A cattle ship abandoned by its crew off Italy with 450 migrants yesterday – many of them women and children - has been docked in Italy. Earlier, rescuers boarded the Ezadeen - a 50 year old ship designed to transport cattle - after a passenger raised the alarm as it drifted in the Mediterranean. The Sierra Leone-flagged, 240ft livestock carrier was found drifting without power about 40 nautical miles off the southern Italian coast. It had been put on a collision course for the Italian coast but ran out of fuel, officials said. Migrants celebrate after arriving in Corigliano Calabro, Italy, after rescuers boarded the transport cattle ship . A migrant pokes his head out the side of the ship - it had been put on a collision course for the Italian coast . The Sierra Leone-flagged, 240ft livestock carrier was found drifting without power off the south Italian coast . Italian coast guard officials, lowered by helicopter onto the bridge, took control of the ship, which was on automatic pilot. Italy's coastguard tweeted to say the ship had arrived in to port shortly before 10pm GMT. The coastguard commander in Corigliano Calabro, Francesco Perrotti, told the BBC all the migrants on board were from Syria. He said they were being taken by bus to other parts of Italy. He described the migrants' physical condition as relatively good after their three-day ordeal. It is believed to have set sail from Turkey, although earlier reports suggest it was from Cyprus. It is thought the migrants were victims of smugglers using an alternative route to the usual one from Libya. Weary migrants disembark the ship after it arrived at the port - they were taken by bus to various parts of Italy . The cargo ship was carrying 450 migrants, including pregnant women and children . The war in Syria has meant the numbers fleeing for Europe has increased dramatically . Migrants look out from the ship - they are often cramped on deck in bitter cold and with few supplies . The migrants' physical condition was described as being relatively good after their three-day ordeal . It came just 48 hours after six officials were dropped on to the deck of another ship, the Blue Sky M, packed with nearly 1,000 Syrians and Kurdish migrants that had been 'locked' on a crash course with the Italian coast. Italian coastguards brought it under control and safely docked it at the Italian port of Gallipoli on Wednesday. Authorities believe the traffickers have adopted 'a policy' of packing old, barely seaworthy vessels with desperate migrants and leaving them to their fate by abandoning ship during the journey. The ships – with their human cargo often cramped on deck in bitter cold and with few supplies – are fixed on a 'crash course' with the Italian coastline, their engines locked or simply allowed to drift towards land. Last year, it is estimated nearly 3,500 refugees died trying to cross the Mediterranean to reach Europe, while another 200,000 were rescued. The war in Syria has meant the numbers fleeing for Europe have risen dramatically, overtaking the numbers of Afghans, Eritreans, Tunisians and other nationalities seeking a new start.","Ship designed to transport cattle was abandoned by its crew off Italy .

"Josh Beaumont may have to wait a while to become a team captain on A Question of Sport, but in many ways he is already emulating his father, Bill, as a rugby player. The 22-year-old Sale No 8 has been a successful skipper at Twickenham, led a national side and made the unorthodox transition from tall fly-half to athletic and skillful forward. Following in his dad’s footsteps all the way to England and Lions recognition will require this season’s giant strides to continue for some time at club level, but the youngest of three Beaumont brothers is showing considerable promise. Josh Beaumont has recently signed a new deal with Sale after a string of impressive performnces . A young Beaumont Jnr (right) pictured with his dad Bill and Prince William at Lions training session . Last month, his outstanding performances for the Sharks were rewarded with a new two-year contract — as further proof that his alternative route into the game has served him well. Instead of the modern staple of graduating from an academy, Beaumont Jnr played for Fylde in National League One before completing a Geography degree at Durham University, which significantly enhanced his rugby development and left some impressive entries on his c.v. It led him to the national stadium and later to the role of England Students captain. ‘I was captain of my uni team in the final year and we went unbeaten that season,’ said Josh. ‘I had a very successful three years up there and played at Twickenham three times. We beat Cardiff Met twice — in my first and third year — but we lost to Hartpury College in the second year. That was our one defeat in my three years there. ‘It was a great experience playing at Twickenham and hopefully I’ll be back there some day. In the final year, because I was captain, I collected the trophy. My dad was there on the front row but it wasn’t him who presented it to me.’ The 22-year-old has made the unorthodox transition from tall fly-half to athletic and skillful forward . Bill Beaumont, pictured in action against South Africa in 1980, captained the British and Irish Lions . Having a familiar rugby name has not always been a blessing. When he was younger, Josh felt being a Beaumont meant he was vulnerable to unfair suggestions of nepotism, but over time he has found his father’s background helpful. ‘When I was younger it was probably a bit of a burden because people would say, “You’re only playing because of your dad”,’ he said. ‘But when you get to this level, you can’t bluff your way through and people understand that. I still get some comments but I just ignore them. It is beneficial because he knows a lot about the game and offers advice, but doesn’t get too involved.’ The game is very different now compared to when Bill was a Grand Slam-winning national icon in the late Seventies and early Eighties. Father and son have enjoyed light-hearted comparisons between their eras. ‘I’ve watched a couple of his games and it’s completely different,’ said Josh. Beaumont, in action for Sale against Saracens, is tackled by Richard Wigglesworth . ‘Some of the stories he comes out with, about old-school rugby… you wouldn’t get away with it now! It’s quite amusing to watch, but I haven’t seen many of his games because it was so long ago — 10 years before I was born.’ The game is much cleaner these days than it was in Bill’s pomp. ‘Back then, you would have had players sent off every five minutes if there had been all the cameras and replays there are now,’ said Josh. ‘Dad jokes that it was tougher in those days and I wouldn’t have lasted five minutes in the Seventies and Eighties!’ Having played rugby at Fylde — his dad’s old Lancashire club — since the age of seven, Josh relished the chance to work with Brian Ashton and Jason Robinson when he broke into the first team as a teenager. Beaumont captained the Durham University rugby team while he studied geography at the institute . By then, he had been advised that his physique was more conducive to playing in the pack, rather than the back-line. ‘When I got to about 16, the coaches suggested I moved into the forwards,’ he said. ‘Before, I was probably the tallest fly-half around — it got a bit ridiculous after a while!’ While his role as RFU chairman and the family textile business keeps him busy, Bill finds time to watch Josh most weekends — as well as older brother Sam, who still plays at Fylde. He is full of paternal pride but plays down his role in his son’s rugby education. ‘He has done really well this season, after missing most of last season with injuries,’ he said. ‘Josh is the youngest of three boys, so whatever games were being played on the lawn he had to get stuck in with older brothers and I think that has helped him. He’s always been a good sportsman, a good ball-player and once he moved into the forwards, he has made great progress. Beaumont Snr  (left) shakes hands with JPR Williams after a Five Nations match between England and Wales . ‘I just try to give him some advice, that’s all. I was quite keen that he did his degree before going into rugby full-time. He really enjoyed university rugby and was lucky to be at Durham when they had a really good team. It meant he got to play at Twickenham three times, which he really enjoyed.’ Bill will be at the Ricoh Arena in Coventry tomorrow to watch Josh play for Sale against Wasps in the Aviva Premiership. One day, he may be able to watch him represent his country at Twickenham — but he won’t burden him with inflated expectation. ‘I don’t want to put any pressure on the lad,’ he said. ‘First, he has to establish himself as a Premiership player and if he does that, who knows what might happen?’","Josh is the son of former England and Lions captain Bill Beaumont .

"England No 8 Ben Morgan has signed a new contract with Gloucester after turning down a move to West Country rivals Bath. The 25-year-old joins Jonny May and Matt Kvesic in committing to the club. It is a significant piece of business for Gloucester, whose Aviva Premiership rivals Bath will now pursue South Africa back row Duane Vermeulen. ‘Everyone knows how much Gloucester mean to me and my family, so I’m delighted to be staying,’ said Morgan. ‘I’m enjoying my rugby and being part of a talented group who are improving week by week.

England international Morgan joins Jonny May and Matt Kvesic in committing his future to the club . ‘I believe there is a bright future for the club, and look forward to being part of it.’ Morgan joined Gloucester in 2012 and has been capped 27 times by England. He was named QBE Man of the Series for his displays during the autumn internationals. He will return from injury to start Gloucester’s match against Exeter at Sandy Park today. Morgan began his career with the Scarlets, who yesterday tied up the services of Wales lock Jake Ball on a national dual contract. Morgan is tackled by Lee Dickson during an Aviva Premiership match against Northampton . Ball, 23, attracted interest from Northampton but follows Sam Warburton, Dan Lydiate, Rhodri Jones, Hallam Amos and Tyler Morgan in agreeing a joint deal with the WRU and the Regions. ‘Jake’s signing on a national dual contract is another important step for the future of the game in Wales,’ said Wales head coach Warren Gatland. ‘A player of Jake’s calibre and age attracted serious interest from outside Wales but the introduction of such contracts means another international has committed his future to Wales and his region.’","Ben Morgan has signed a new contract at Gloucester .

"Exit plan: Art critic Brian Sewell knows how and where he wants to die . Every night I swallow a handful of pills. In the morning and during the day I swallow others,  haphazardly, for I am not always in the right place at the right time, but at night there is a ritual. I undress. I clean my teeth. I wipe the mirror clear of splashes and see with some distaste the reflection of my decaying body, wondering that it ever had the impertinence to indulge in the pleasures of the flesh. And then I take the pills. Some are for a heart that too often makes me feel that I have a misfiring single-cylinder diesel engine in my rib-cage. Others are for the ordinary afflictions of age and still others ease the aches of old bones that creak and crunch. All in their way are poisons – that they do no harm is only a matter of dosage. I intend, one day, to take an overdose. Not yet, for the experts at that friendly and understanding hospital, the Brompton in Kensington, manage my heart condition very well. But the bone-rot will reach a point – not beyond endurance but beyond my willingness to endure it – when drugs prescribed to numb the pain so affect the functions of my brain that all the pleasures of music, art and books are dulled, and I merely exist. An old buffer in a chair, sleeping and waking, sleeping and waking. The thought of suicide is a great comfort, for it is what I shall employ if mere existence is ever all that I have. The difficulty will be that I must have the wit to identify the time, the weeks, the days, even  the critical moment (for it will not be long) between my recognising the need to end my life and the loss of my physical ability to carry out the plan. There is a plan. I know exactly what I want to do and where I want to do it – not at home, not in my own bed. I shall write a note addressed ‘To whom it may concern’ explaining that I am committing suicide, that I am in sound mind, that no one else has been involved and, if I am discovered before my heart has stopped, I do not want to be resuscitated. Confronting death: Mr Sewell says that he one day intends to end his life and he finds it a 'great comfort' With this note in my pocket, I shall leave the house and totter off to a bench – foolishly installed by the local authority on a road so heavy with traffic that no one ever sits there – make myself comfortable and down as many pills as I can with a bottle of Bombay Gin, the only spirit that I like, to send them on their way. With luck, no one will notice me for hours – and if they do, will think me an old drunk. Some unfortunate athlete will find me, stiff with rigor, on his morning jog. I have left my cadaver to a teaching hospital for the use and abuse of medical students – and my sole misgiving is that, having filled it with poisons, I may have rendered it useless. There are those who damn the suicide for invading the prerogative of the Almighty. Many years, however, have passed since I abandoned the beliefs, observances and irrational prejudices of Christianity, and I have no moral or religious inhibitions against suicide. I cherish the notion of dying easily and with my wits about me. I am 82 tomorrow and do not want to die a dribbling dotard waiting for the Queen’s congratulatory greeting in 2031. Nor do I wish to cling to an increasingly wretched life made unconscionable misery by acute or chronic pain and the humiliations of nursing. What virtue can there be in suffering, in impotent wretchedness, in the bedpans and pisspots, the feeding with a spoon, the baby talk, the dwindling mind and the senses slipping in and out of consciousness? For those so affected, dying is a prolonged and degrading misadventure. ‘We can ease the pain,’ says another of this interregnum between life and death. But what of those who want to hurry on? Then the theologian argues that a man must not play God and determine his own end and prates of the purification of the soul through suffering and pain. But what if the dying man is atheist or agnostic or has lost his faith – must he suffer life longer because of the prejudice of a Christian theologian? And has it occurred to no theologian that God himself might inspire the thought of suicide – or is that too great a heresy? Distinguished career: Mr Sewell at the Natural History Museum in London as a young critic . Suicide may even be a noble act. During the Battle of the Atlantic in the Second World War, there were many examples of suicidal heroism when men relinquished hold on  dinghies or flotsam for the sake of other men, and swam away to die. I have no doubt that in Afghanistan now some soldiers have taken suicidal risks for their peers in the platoon. Self-sacrifice may in such circumstances be a response more powerfully instinctive than self-preservation. These are suicides whom we do not hesitate to honour. Surely self-sacrifice and suicide are different only in degree? Why then do so many of us deplore the calculated suicides of those who see no point in the endurance of pain or the emptiness of a life maintained and conditioned by drugs, or a life simply not worth living? My mother had an extraordinary will to live and, when the demons of dementia stormed her brain, she retreated into her girlhood and lived her early life again, while nurses attended to the functions of the shrivelled bag of bones that her body had become. She was, in some wonderful way, content with what she had and determined to continue with it. But other women in my life offer very different examples. Frances, told that chemotherapy might give her six more months and that without it she would die in three, kept her joyful wits and glossy hair and lapsed into unconsciousness at home, content to know that she was still beautiful. Mary, swept into hospital with pancreatic cancer with only weeks to live, was given morphine, but contrived to increase the dose so that it killed her overnight. Lillian, on the other hand, a sometime ballet dancer, dying of old age, her frail body  littered with the tubes and wires of medical salvation, woke from near-death to ask: ‘Oh God, am I still here?’ A cry for pity, yet she was compelled to endure another month before death naturally supervened. It was Mary who introduced me to the idea of assisted dying, the then euphemism for an act of suicide of which the subject was incapable without help. She talked often of her wish to go quickly and easily when the time came, but had discovered that if she could not manage it herself, she could not rely on her doctor to do the deed. Determined: Mr Sewell, pictured at home in London, wants Parliament to allow doctors to help patients end their own lives . The Zurich solution she found too complicated, cold and alien. ‘Will you give me the push?’ she asked. I gave her the answer she wished to hear, but had not the foggiest notion of how it could be done.  I asked a doctor friend, but he  adamantly refused to answer. It is not fair to ask one’s doctor, for his oaths oblige him to do the very opposite. It is the doctor, indeed, who may save the life of the despairing suicide – the victim not of age, but of broken marriage or love affair, of failed career or bankrupt business, or the adolescent who feels disgraced by academic failure or sexual direction. It was the 16th Century Spanish mystic St John of the Cross who in ‘the dark night of the soul’ conjured the perfect picture of despair as the point of stifling hopelessness beyond which nothing lies. This is suicide of a very different kind, from which, if discovered in time with understanding, sympathy and love, there may well be a dawn to the dark night. But I speak for those of sound mind who have considered what is to be done with them if their bodies let them down in ways that are beyond endurance and who have left it too late to inflict death on themselves. To ask close members of the family is not only to cast them into the deep, dark and ancient anguishes explored by the dramatists of classical Greece, but to put them in legal jeopardy. To ask a friend is to require of him the greatest act of love, for he too is vulnerable to the law. In December 1997, Parliament debated the ‘Doctor Assisted Dying Bill’. This was to give those who suffer incurable illness, terminal illness or dire physical impairment the right to commit suicide when they are physically incapable of the act, calling on doctors to provide the means to pursue the execution. Much talk was the immediate consequence, but no action followed. It is time to try again. Could Parliament not at least pass a Bill that allows doctors to assist the dying of patients who, unquestionably lucid and articulate, have expressed an unequivocal and determined choice? It is so simple – it is a living will, a witnessed legal document clearly expressing the wish to be put into the arms of Morpheus if we are stricken mute and motionless.

"Happy New Year and 2015 promises to be an exciting year for rugby with the Rugby World Cup taking place in England in September and October. But the year starts, in Scotland, with the return leg of the 1872 Cup on Friday at Murrayfield and my New Year wish is that we get a better game than we had last week at Scotstoun. But before I get to the rugby, I really think this game is a missed opportunity. I am told they are expecting a crowd of 12,000 to 14,000 which is way above Edinburgh’s average home attendance. But why are we not trying to fill Murrayfield? Harlequins filled Twickenham’s 82,000 seats last week for their match against Northampton, Leinster move the Munster game to the Aviva and get 50,000 and Saracens have had 90,000 in Wembley. They have all done this by getting two things right, first marketing the game properly and second, get the ticket prices right. Harlequins titled their game last week ‘Big Game 7’ and by doing this they created a product that they priced right and sold the product using social media as a way to attract new fans. They put on entertainment which meant the whole experience was one that will entice some of the first-timers to come back to another game. A general view of Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh last September . Twickenham was packed for the Premiership match between Harlequins and Northampton last week . Scottish Rugby has marketed this game  in the usual way they always market the game and, as a result, they will get the usual crowd. This was a great opportunity to try something different as everyone is looking for something to do by the 2nd January. I would love to have seen an attempt made to fill Murrayfield and try and attract the latent support for rugby that exists in Edinburgh. Remember, 38,000 fans came to Murrayfield to see Edinburgh play Toulouse in the Heineken Cup a few years ago so the support is there, it just needs to be attracted in. Make the tickets £10 for adults and kids free, bombard social media and other advertising mediums with a campaign to ‘Fill Murrayfield, and get people talking about the game. As usual at this time of the year, I have been at many social gatherings yet nobody was talking about the game at Murrayfield which is a shame. Aim for 60,000 and if you only get 40,000 on first attempt, make sure the experience is such that we fill it the following year. There is an element of a feel-good factor within Scottish Rugby with Glasgow doing so well and Scotland having a promising Autumn Series so this was the time to try something different. None of this is ground breaking, it is what many clubs have done with success for a number of years and I hope we have a crack at this next year. Edinburgh players applaud their Glasgow opponents off the pitch after the first leg of the 1872 Cup . If we do want a bigger crowd to attend these matches, the quality of rugby on offer needs to be better than we saw in the first leg and I think it will be on Friday. The big Murrayfield pitch and the quality of the new pitch should allow this to happen but the attitude of both teams needs to be better than last week. Both teams seemed only concerned with stopping the opposition playing and this played right into Edinburgh’s hands. They have made themselves hard to play against with being strong in defence and very competitive in the tackle area. They lack creativity and have picked Greg Tonks at stand off when I felt they looked more dangerous when he was moved to full back last week. But they still have quality players in Matt Scott, Dave Denton and Ross Ford and these guys will be desperate to put one over the team that have dominated the Scottish game for a number of years now. Glasgow Warriors' Josh Strauss crosses the line to score a try in the first leg last week . Glasgow have the better players and, if they get their off-loading game going which allows their dangerous runners to find space, they will cause Edinburgh all sorts of problems. The selection of Tyrone Holmes is interesting as he is a specialist open side which would suggest Glasgow intend to play a faster and wider game than last week. This may have been decided for them with Rob Harley’ s injury but Holmes’ battle with Roddy Grant at the breakdown will be key. Glasgow have too much quality for Edinburgh in the starting team as well as the bench where they have the luxury of bringing on two Lions in Euan Murray and Stuart Hogg so I expect Glasgow to win. If they get their attitude and execution right they could even get the bonus point win as well as the 1872 Cup for another year.","The return leg of the 1872 Cup takes place at Murrayfield on Friday night .

Quite rightly, therefore, it is Rory who receives our Golfer of the Year Award for 2014. 'Rory is a fine ambassador for the game of golf and a loyal supporter of the European Tour, as he has shown with his backing of the Irish Open next year, so we are all very proud of his success, not only during this year but across his career to date.'

"The sport of darts is probably undergoing its biggest transformation at the elite level in more than two decades. Yet one thing always seems to be constant: Phil ‘The Power’ Taylor remaining in the hunt for the world crown. The 2015 William Hill PDC world darts championship, which reaches the quarter-final stage on Thursday evening, could mark the watershed moment that England’s dominance of the arrows comes to an end. Of the eight quarter-finalists, only two — Taylor and reigning BDO world champion Stephen Bunting — are English. The remaining six consist of three Dutchmen, including defending champion Michael van Gerwen, and three Scots. Phil 'The Power' Taylor is one of just two English players who have made the World Championship last eight . Taylor flashes a broad smile as he walks onto the oche at the Alexandra Palace to face Kim Huybrechts . A changing of the guard seems to be underway. To put this all into context, this is the fewest number of Englishmen since three made the last eight in 2009. Between 1998-2000 and 2004-06, the last eight comprised completely of home-grown throwers. One man who has been there throughout — and still continues to deliver — is Taylor, who plays Dutchman Vincent van der Voort on Friday evening in his record 20th quarter-final appearance at the PDC worlds. The 16-time world champion, who survived a tough third-round examination by Belgian Kim Huybrechts on Tuesday, reckons he enters the New Year, at 54 years old, playing as good as ever. ‘The experience I have, the talent I have, I’m only going to get better,’ he said. ‘I’m practising better, I’m improving, my darts are better and I’m going to get better — trust me. Dutchman Vincent van der Voort is Taylor's next opponent in the quarter-finals . Stephen Bunting, the reigning BDO world champion, is the only other Englishman in the last eight . 'I’m not going to bow down to anybody. I mean that in all sincerity. I’m improving. Age will not weary me — not for the next three years anyway. ‘The standards are now are higher compared to 10 years ago. Players are hungrier, more aggressive. I’ve had to adapt. These young kids are playing week-in, week-out. They have so much energy, pounding away, they don’t fear anyone. ‘My victory over Kim was massive. That could win me the world championship — the rest of the field will be going “oh s***” because I’m still in.’ No 1 seed Van Gerwen plays Robert Thornton in the last eight on Thursday night. Then, there is a belated Hogmanay present as two popular Scots, Peter Wright and Gary Anderson, take to the Ally Pally oche.

"Phil Taylor survived a scare to reach the quarter-finals of the 2015 World Darts Championship on Tuesday night despite the antics of Kim Huybrechts at the Alexandra Palace. The 16-time record world champion was visibly annoyed whenever Huybrechts celebrated, and punished the Belgian by coming from behind three times to win 4-3. The Power warned the 29-year-old on Sunday he was looking forward to a ‘good scrap’ and that there would ‘be trouble’ if Huybrechts jumped around on stage as he normally does. 16-time world champion Phil 'The Power' Taylor celebrates his narrow victory on Tuesday evening . Taylor’s threats did little to deter Huybrechts from getting up to his usual tricks but the psychological ploy did not get the better of The Power. ‘I’m speechless. I’m through. I’m still in,’ Taylor said. ‘I’m going to get ready for the next round now. I’m over the moon, I really am. I’m going to get better. I’m going to improve. Trust me, I’m going to get better.’ Taylor’s 102.5 average to Huybrechts’s 96.9 paid off in the end, thought the underdog surprised by taking the first set in front of a sold-out 2,500 crowd at the Ally Pally. Kim Huybrechts clearly agitated Taylor with his flamboyant celebrations during their match at the Ally Pally . Huybrechts danced around as he twice lead Taylor and even had a 141 checkout to win the match . The Power made it 1-1 then had to come from behind again after losing the third, where he was being wound up by his opponent’s flaunting celebration. After levelling it at 2-2, Taylor walked away from the oche mumbling to himself. Huybrechts went ahead again, making it 3-2, putting him one set away from a major upset. He had a 141 finish to win the match, but was unable to do so. Taylor responded, making it 3-3, and made a point to smile at his opponent after retrieving his darts from the board. The Power won the match 4-3 with double 18 his final stab, and the pair shook hands. Taylor thanks the crowd after securing a tense win over Kim Huybrechts in the last-16 at the Ally Pally . Here's an incredible shot of Taylor's throw in action during his last-16 clash at the Ally Pally on Tuesday . The Ally Pally was rocking as record 16-time world champion Phil Taylor was pushed close to defeat . ‘I’m going to be back. I’m going to work hard and be there again and try as hard as I can,’ Huybrechts said. ‘That’s new for me. Phil has been on that stage 30, 40 times. It’s my fourth time. ‘I’ve done myself proud, fans proud, sponsors, proud. I’m happy. I fought until the end. People can blame me celebrating in the end, but I’ve done myself proud.’ Taylor would not have been the only former world champion to be booted from the competition that offers £250,000 to the winner.

"Adrian Lewis sensationally hit a nine-darter on Tuesday — only the eighth achieved in the 20-year history of the PDC World Darts Championships — yet somehow contrived to lose to an inspired Raymond van Barneveld. Players often hit nine-dart finishes in practice but then struggle to repeat the feat on the main stage in front of a live audience. Yet, in the fifth leg of the first set, two-time world champion Lewis gave the 2,500 capacity crowd a memorable moment by hitting two 180s, treble 20, treble 19 and double 12 with nine perfect darts. Raymond van Barneveld celebrates after beating Adrian Lewis in a thrilling encounter . The Dutchman won the match 4-3 after Lewis had hit a nine-dart finish in the first set . Van Barneveld shakes hand with opponent Lewis after earning a quarter-final spot . However, as is sometimes the case, the person who accomplishes such a wonderful feat suddenly loses focus and concentration. Lewis missed one match dart in the sixth set to move into the quarter-final and the Dutchman punished him, completing a 4-3 victory with his sixth match dart. 'What a game,' said an exhausted Barney. 'After he hit the nine-darter, I thought: 'Hold on, is this the standard?' 'But he struggled to hit his trebles or big shots afterwards. I don't know what to say. I'm so happy. I never gave up and I took my chances.' Lewis shrugs to the crowd after hitting first nine-dart finish of the World Darts Championship .

For once, this was a darts contest that lived up to its billing. This was the first time the two tungsten titans, with seven world titles between then, had met at this level and while the doubles ratios were poor given their respective calibre, there was plenty of drama and tension on offfer. It was undoubtedly the best match of this tournament. 'It was my own fault,' Lewis said. 'I hit a nine-darter on the stage and then also in the warm-up during the break. But that's no consolation. I played well enough to walk off 4-0. He got away with it.' Phil Taylor reached the world championships quarter-final for the 20th time in 22 years following a feisty 4-3 victory over Kim Huybrechts. Phil Taylor beat Kim Huybrechts 4-3 during a tense encounter to reach the quarter-final . It is the 20th time in the last 22 years that Taylor had made the last eight of the world championships . Though the pair embraced at the end, Taylor was visibly unhappy throughout with the Belgian's wild histrionics on the stage whenever he hit a checkout. But the Power possessed greater class and guts when it mattered, coming from 2-1 and 3-2 down to prevail in the final set. Taylor, who now plays Vincent van der Voort in the last eight on Friday, said: 'Kim was full of beans, giving it large after every big shot. He seemed to throw more right-handers than Nigel Benn in celebration. But I knew that I have been there before, Kim hasn't, and that was the difference.'

"Adrian Lewis hit the first nine-darter of the 2015 World Darts Championship at the Alexandra Palace before going on to lose against Raymond van Barneveld. Jackpot won the £10,000 prize money for the feat at the Ally Pally, the second time he has inflicted nine perfect darts against Van Barneveld and the third televised of his career. The 29-year-old hit a nine-darter in this tournament against Gary Anderson in the 2011 final before going on to become world champion, but it did little good on Tuesday night as he lost 4-3 against the resilient Dutchman. Adrian Lewis shrugs to the crowd after hitting first nine-dart finish of the World Darts Championship . Opponent Raymond van Barneveld congratulates Lewis after earning himself £10,000 in prize money . Lewis achieved his latest and third of 2014, following two in Players Championship events, by hitting two 180s before finishing with treble, 20, treble 19 and double 12 in front of a 2,500-strong crowd in north London. The two-time world champion turned to the crowd, put his hands in his pockets and shrugged his shoulders, before Van Barneveld hugged his opponent as they walked away from the oche for the first break after Jackpot took the opening set. But Barney came from behind three times to win 4-3 and book his place in the quarter-finals, which will be played on January 2. 'What a game,' Van Barneveld said. 'The first set of the match was probably the best I've played so far then Aidey got a nine-darter. I thought, hold on, if this is the standard what can I do? Jackpot fist pumps to the crowd in celebration after claiming the first set with the nine-darter . 'I'm thinking just keep believing. I saw Aidey was struggling. He didn't hit trebles anymore. I don't know what to say, I'm so happy. I'm a five-time world champion, Aidey in the last couple of years has been amazing. I don't know what to say, I'm so happy.' Nine-darters used to be better rewarded than they are now, with Phil Taylor taking £100,000 for his first in 2002 and 501 bottles of Budweiser for two others in 2004 and 2005. Jackpot’s £10,000 bonus may be modest in comparison but it takes him to fourth in the all-time list of televised nine-darters behind The Power, Van Barneveld and Michael van Gerwen. The pair walk off arm in arm for a break after Lewis wins the first set with the feat . The £10,000 will be shared, too, if another player hits a nine-darter during the remainder of the tournament, which concludes with the final on January 4, where the winner will receive £250,000.

"With his seat among the golfing gods already secured, you could forgive Ernie Els for packing his clubs away for good. But when work consists of cruising on a yacht along the shoreline of a paradise island, stopping to hit a few balls into the crystal waters and admire the view, who needs retirement? Besides, Els simply can't help but compete. Above all, he still wants to win the one major he felt he was born to win. At Augusta National next April Rory McIlroy will attempt to write himself into the history books and Tiger Woods will bid to have his picture printed on the front cover. But Els yearns to beat them both, plus all of golf's young guns, and win the Masters at long last. The green jacket is his holy grail. 'When I was young, I was very cocky and thought I was going to win all the majors by nomination,' he says. 'I thought the Masters was going to be the first one I’d win and then The Open, and then the US Open and US PGA Championship. Well, I haven’t won the Masters so far and I haven’t won the US PGA, so I’m going to try to win the Masters before I retire. This would possibly be my biggest career achievement.' Ernie Els poses on board a yacht in the Andaman Sea, off the Malaysian island of Langkawi . Els hits balls into the ocean off the shore of Datai Bay, where he has just redesigned a golf course . Els will be 45 when he next drives down Magnolia Lane, so it is hard not to disagree with that sentiment. Jack Nicklaus remains the oldest Masters winner, aged 46 in 1986. Majors: 4 (US Open - 1994, 1997; The Open - 2002, 2012) Best finishes in other majors: . Masters: 2nd - 2000, 2004 . US PGA Championship: 3rd - 1995, 2007 . Professional wins: 67 . Other: . 7x World Match Play champion . World Golf Hall of Fame - 2011 . European Tour Order of Merit - 2003, 2004 . Sunshine Tour Order of Merit - 1991, 1995 . McIlroy will be chasing a career grand slam in the majors and Woods's desire to overhaul Nicklaus's record haul of 18 burns as brightly as ever, so Els will have to do it the hard way. And that's not to mention Bubba Watson's recent miracles at the Cathedral of Pines. But Els has beaten the odds before, most recently in pipping Adam Scott at The Open in 2012. You could also say he has a score to settle. His US Open wins in 1994 and 1997 seemed to herald an era where he and Woods would share majors between them. But according to his former sports psychologist Jos Vanstiphout, Els developed 'Tigeritis' – a belief that Woods was unbeatable. To be fair his wasn't the only mind troubled by that thought as Woods collected 14 majors in 11 years. Asked who he considers his toughest opponent, Els turns first to his old foe: 'Back in the day, it was definitely Tiger Woods; he was by far the best. 'It was tough for me because I felt that I could really be the best player in the world and I was for a short time on paper, but Tiger was really the man to beat. He was a very difficult competitor. The South African shows off the stunning scenery, including a million-year-old rainforest . Els speaks at the opening of his course. His golf design business is flourishing alongside his playing career . 'Nowadays it’s the game itself and the youngsters - Rickie Fowler, Adam Scott, we can go on and on... Jordan Speith. There are so many other really good players.' Els fails to mention McIlroy but that is surely nothing more than an unintentional slip. Where Els was once denied majors by Woods he must now overcome the likes of the reigning Open and US PGA Champion to claim the four biggest prizes in the game. Els admits that 'the wins aren’t coming as frequently as they used to' - he hasn't won a tournament since the BMW International Open in June 2013 - but insisted 'I really enjoy my game and my time out there'. Els is addicted to winning. No matter how many time he is knocked down by Woods, McIlroy and the rest, he can't help but haul himself back off the canvas for another pop at the champ. Els celebrates the fourth major win of his career after The Open at Royal Lytham in 2012 . Els beat Colin Montgomerie among others to win the US Open for a second time at Congressional in 1997 . 'Any time you lift a trophy it’s a wonderful and memorable moment,' he admits. 'The joy is indescribable. 'I love competition. I love doing anything if its competition, if it's table tennis or tennis against my daughter, whoever, even a pool game, anything. Competition is what it’s all about. I’ve been competing since I was 10 years old in a lot of different sports, it’s in my blood. I’m still trying, I want to try and win one or two more majors before I’m totally done.' While the fires of ambition still crackle inside Els, it will not be too many years before he is forced to rage against the dying of his golfing light. For now, however, there is too much still to achieve; most importantly, that green jacket has never been draped over the giant shoulders of the Big Easy. The South African admits he enjoys taking on golf's brightest young players, like Rory McIloy (left) Tiger Woods is the fiercest competitor Els has ever faced and prevented him from winning more majors . Els admits his one major ambition still remaining is to win the Masters at Augusta National before he retires . Off the course, his golf course design business is flourishing following the high-profile and controversial remodelling of Wentworth's iconic West Course. It requires him to travel the globe to work on stunning projects, such as the one that sees him soaking up the sun on this yacht in Malaysia. The Els Club Teluk Datai is built amid a million-year-old rainforest on the island of Langwai in the Andaman sea. Nice work if you can get it. But it doesn't satisfy that yearning for competition. Els once told the world he was ready to retire to the Caribbean after he'd won a major, but the bar flies of Kingston and Havana are yet to hover around any watering hole of his. 'I said that back in the early 90s. The media asked me ""what will happen if you win this US Open?"" I said: “Well, I’d just take the money and go to the Caribbean, open a bar and that would be that"". Well, that was 21 years ago and I am still trying to win more tournaments, as well as building golf courses all over the world, so I guess that bar is gonna have to wait.'","Ernie Els says his remaining ambition is to win the Masters .

"Cam Newton says he feels lucky to be alive after miraculously escaping a car crash with two fractured bones in his lower back. Two days after the accident, which saw his Dodge pick-up truck flip over two or three times after colliding with a vehicle, Newton returned to the Carolina Panthers facility to begin rehab. After dragging himself out of the truck, the 25-year-old said he couldn't speak but could not stop smiling. 'I couldn't really talk afterwards, because I was in such shock.

Newton's Dodge pick-up truck is pictured on its side after the two-car accident near to the Panthers' stadium . He examined the crash scene and it simply did not make sense. 'In my book, one plus one is always going to equal two,' he said. 'I'm looking at this truck and I'm looking at this accident and I'm like, ""Dude, one plus one ain't equalling two"".

"Darren Bent is set to sign for Derby County until the end of the season to boost the Championship side’s promotion ambitions and end his time at Aston Villa. The former England striker will meet head coach Steve McClaren on Friday and should pen his deal once the transfer window opens on Saturday. Bent, 30, will not be able to feature in Derby’s FA Cup match against Southport as players must be registered with the FA by midday on Friday – but he would be available for the key game against Ipswich at Portman Road on January 10. Darren Bent's (left) Aston Villa contract runs out in the summer, and he will sign for Derby until its conclusion . Bent has spent the last month on loan at the Amex, playing for Brighton and Hove Albion in the Championship . The short-term transfer should bring to an end Bent’s Aston Villa career, with his £65,000 per week contract expiring in the summer. He moved to Villa Park in January 2011 at a cost of £18million and has scored 25 goals in 72 games. Bent spent last season on loan at Fulham and had a brief spell at Brighton this campaign, scoring twice in five matches. Brighton paid £18,000 of his wages and Derby are likely to be contributing a similar amount. Bent is believed to have chosen Derby ahead of other clubs for football reasons. McClaren will believe he can re-invigorate a striker who could add a timely cutting edge to Derby’s bid for Premier League football. McClaren handed Bent two of his 13 England caps during his time as national manager.","Darren Bent will sign for Derby on loan when the transfer window opens .

"Nicky Deverdics thought he was destined for a future in the top flight when he was training with Alan Shearer, Craig Bellamy and Gary Speed at Newcastle as a teenager, under the tutelage of Sir Bobby Robson. Fresh-faced from Newcastle’s academy, having signed professional terms there at 16-years-old, he was awestruck when opportunities arose to take part in sessions with the first-team at their Darlsey Park training facility. Back then he tried to keep his head down, keep it simple and avoid becoming the butt of their jokes. Nicky Deverdics in action during spells with former clubs Gretna and Barnet . Little did he know at that stage that his career would take him plummeting down the football pyramid, into the the murky depths of non-League to spells playing abroad in Iceland and the Faroe Islands, at times without a club and on the verge of giving it all up. But after sticking with it, the 27-year-old is set to test his ability against Barclays Premier League opposition when his Conference side Dover face Crystal Palace in the FA Cup Third Round. ‘Newcastle had probably their best team when I was coming through,’ Deverdics, a life-long Newcastle fan, explains. 'When you’re a youngster with the first team you’re just trying to get on and do nothing wrong. Just pass the ball, keep under the radar so they don’t start coming at you with their banter. Otherwise you’re in trouble. ‘You make sure you do things right. Keep your head down. It was great playing with them and seeing their quality. But in my second year it was all change, Graeme Souness came in and Glenn Roeder became academy manager and he released me.’ The home of Conference Premier side Dover will be the venue for the FA Cup game against Crystal Palace . Stefan Payne, striker, 23 . He is on fire at the moment with nine goals in his last 12 games. He’s scoring goals and looking like he’ll score every game. He’s strong but he’s pacy at the same time, a real handful. He’ll work for the full 90 minutes and he won’t give defenders a rest. Connor Essam, centre-back, 22 . He has led the team really well as stand-in skipper. He’s so strong at the back, solid as a rock, and he popped up with the goal to knock Cheltenham Town out last round. Andy Rafferty, goalkeeper, 26 . He kept seven clean sheets on the spin at home this season and only conceded two all season in nine games on our turf. He’s been brilliant for us. He’s come on loan from Hartlepool, and we couldn’t believe he hadn’t been playing for them. He’s been huge. Deverdics admits, frankly, that at 18 his attitude was the key factor in the demise of his career. ‘I was immature and clueless,’ he says. ‘Glenn had me playing left back but I’m an attacking central midfielder. 'Being so young and at Newcastle I was thinking something else will come up. ‘I played up a bit. My attitude was the reason they let me go. I regret it. Thinking I knew it all was the problem.’ Deverdics’ Hungarian surname – pronounced Dev-er-dich – which comes from his grandfather belies the lad who was born and bred in Gateshead and still maintains a thick Geordie accent despite living in Milton Keynes now. He turned to his local club, in the sixth tier of English football, when no-one came calling for his services after being ditched by Newcastle. ‘It was a wakeup call,’ he says. ‘It was like fight football. It was scrappy. If you’ve got anything about you they just want to smash you. Dover will be dreaming of a cup upset against Palace at the Crabble Athletic Ground on Sunday . ‘It didn’t work out for me, the manager told me he can’t play me because the other players weren’t reading what I was trying to do. I was giving the ball away because the players weren’t reading the passes I was making.’ Still a teenager, he tumbled even further down the pyramid and had a brief spell at Bedlington Terriers before moving to Gretna and winning promotion from Scottish Division One in the last minute of the last game of the season. But, like so much of Deverdics’ career, it went wrong. He was finally playing back at a level he felt his ability warranted, in the Scottish Premier League, when Gretna’s owner, businessman Brooks Mileson, died after suffering a heart attack and falling into his pond. The club ceased to exist after finishing the season and Deverdics was back on the transfer scrap heap. This prompted his next move to Barnet, then in League Two, where he played in the same midfield as Yannick Bolasie, who he will come up against on Sunday. ‘He was raw back then,’ Deverdics remembers. ‘He had the skill he has now, he’d do something with the ball, a movement of quick feet, and you’d think, “I could try that 100 times and it ain’t happening.” ‘He’s got that bit of ridiculousness. He just makes it up on the spot at times, it comes to him a split second earlier than other people think.’ In-form Crystal Palace winger Yannick Bolasie is a former team-mate of Deverdics . Yet while the other three in that midfield of Bolasie and Albert Adomah, who plays for Middlesbrough, on the wings and Neal Bishop, who is now at Scunthrope, in the centre, went upwards, Deverdics went down again. A pre-season at Blyth Spartans, in the Conference North, had only meant to be to maintain fitness, but that turned into a whole season and for the first time since he signed professional terms at Newcastle Deverdics was not playing full-time. ‘I scratched my head at how three had gone one way and I went the other,’ he adds. Deverdics needed to get away and flew to Iceland with Tomi Ameobi, the middle brother of Shola and Sammy, where they played for BÍ/Bolungarvík in the tiny town of Isafjorour with a population of 3,000. But though the mountainous scenery where the sun bounced off the fjord every morning was ‘like something out of a James Bond movie, you felt like someone was going to parachute over the top,’ Deverdics was left more shaken than stirred by the poor quality of football and quickly left. He tried abroad again at Faroe Islands club TB Tvøroyri, where it was even worse. ‘You see lads having kebabs the night before games, or going to pizza shop just before a match, you think, “what’s going on?” It was an eye-opener, made me realise I needed to back in England where people take football as seriously as me.’ Deverdics was determined not to give up, contrary to the advice of others, staying single to devote his life to football. He was lured to a showcase event at the Etihad Stadium with the promise of scouts and agents in attendance. Dover manager Chris Kinnear looks on during a photo shoot ahead of his side's match against Palace . ‘I turned up and it was absolutely garbage,’ he recalls. ‘I’d been sold something, told there would be out-of-work former pros there, top quality players, but most of them had never, ever played Football League. Kids were turning up who would’ve done well to get in my school team. When I was 12. But there was a little silver lining.’ Deverdics’ current agents picked him up from there. When they got him in at Dover last July, he had no idea he would be pitting himself against Premier League opposition so soon. ‘They couldn’t have got me further away from Newcastle if they tried. They might as well have spoken to a few clubs in France,’ he jokes. ‘There’ve been plenty of times when people have told me to let it go, but I’m adamant I’ve got a point to prove in this country. ‘My aim is to get back into the Football League, whether it’s with Dover or somewhere else longer-term. I’m genuinely enjoying my football for the first time in a long time.’","Nicky Deverdics was on Newcastle's books as a youngster before being released after failing to make the grade .

"John Carver said Sir Bobby Robson would be his inspiration in winning the Newcastle manager’s job on a permanent basis, but this was more like Kevin Keegan’s nerve-shredding Entertainers. At times, the performance was brilliant, at others baffling. Crucially, though, Keegan’s swashbucklers of the mid Nineties invariably scored one more than the opposition. But to share six goals with relegation candidates Burnley – three times squandering the lead – was not what caretaker boss Carver had hoped for in part one of his audition for the leading role at his hometown club.

Here's the build-up for Jack Colback's goal for Newcastle. Click HERE to see more from our brilliant Match Zone. In the end, the Magpies were fortunate to escape with a point. Four times Sean Dyche’s side cracked the woodwork and the St James’ Park crowd grumbled their irritation on full-time at the surrender of maximum points. Carver – in charge with Alan Pardew having quit for Crystal Palace - concedes he was mystified by his side’s collapse. ‘It was like the old days when Kevin (Keegan) was manager,’ reflected Carver, who revealed he has lost Steven Taylor to an achilles injury for the remainder of the season. ‘I’ve never been involved in a football match where that cliche of two halves was so apparent. ‘That was some of the best football we’ve played in the first half. We could have been two or three up. We passed it well, our movement was good and we were positive. ‘But they were direct in the second half and we did not know how to deal with their approach. ‘I’m so disappointed because we were so good in the first half and so poor the second. We were lucky to get away with a point. Burnley should have won the game. ‘If I was a Newcastle fan sitting in the stand then I’d be going to the pub and I’d be disappointed.’ Steven Taylor celebrates after scoring the opening goal for Newcastle United against Burnley at St James' Park on New Year's Day .

Danny Ings celebrates after scoring an equaliser for Burnley against Newcastle United in the 66th minute . Taylor, Jack Colback and Moussa Sissoko had given United the lead, but on each occasion the Clarets found an equaliser. Their final leveller came four minutes from time when George Boyd smashed through the weak grasp of rookie goalkeeper Jak Alnwick. Earlier, a Paul Dummett own goal and Danny Ings’ fifth of the season had restored parity. Burnley came from two down to claim a point at Manchester City on Sunday and, while they still remain in the drop zone, Dyche – who was forced into three changes before half-time - has reason for positivity. ‘It was interesting day at office, I’ve never experienced losing three players to illness or injury so early in the game,’ he said. ‘But I could not be more proud of the players. Some of our quality was outstanding. ‘Newcastle were excellent for 25 minutes. But our response just shows the unshakable desire and belief we have in each other. ‘Manuel Pellegrini said how bright we were in our forward play the other day and I’m happy with the energy and endeavour of the team. ‘My belief is still there that we will stay up.’ It had been an absorbing affair. The game was just 54 seconds old when Ings sprung Ashley Barnes clear and his stab cannoned off the upright with Alnwick beaten. But it was Newcastle who seized the lead. They went two years without netting from a corner under Pardew and he had even ordered his analysis staff to produce a report of all goals from flag-kicks in the Premier League in a bid to find a scoring formula.

Jack Colback became the first Newcastle player to score and provide an assist in the same league game this season. It didn’t work. Under Carver, though, it took just 15 minutes. Colback delivered from the right and Taylor rose to glance home from six yards. Within four minutes the visitors were level, Dummett inadvertently nodding a dropping ball over Alnwick and into his own net from 10 yards. No matter, the mood during those early exchanges dictated that Carver’s team would simply go in search of another and they were duly back in front on 26 minutes. Daryl Janmaat rolled a short pass to Colback and he laced delightfully into the bottom corner from 25 yards. But that was where their dominance faded. Within minutes of the restart after half-time the outstanding Ings sized a curler from the edge of the area and, when that cracked the underside of the bar and bounced out, Barnes headed against the base of the post before a relieved Alnwick smothered.

Again Newcastle needed the frame of the goal to preserve their lead when Ben Mee’s header – from David Jones’ corner – smashed the crossbar. The pressure eventually told. Michael Kightly swept over a cross from the left and Ings, peeling off Dummett, flicked his header into the bottom corner. At this juncture you’d wager on only one side scoring again, and it wasn’t Newcastle. In Ayoze Perez, though, they have unearthed a star. And it was the Spaniard’s jinking run and cross – mishit by Adam Armstrong – which allowed Sissoko to steam in and place beyond Heaton. But Burnley did not deserve defeat and so it was that Boyd pounced as they again came from behind to claim an invaluable point in their fight for survival. For Carver, he was just relieved it had not been all three.","Steven Taylor scored the opening goal for Newcastle United in the 15th minute .

"Sean Dyche is pleased his Burnley side are beginning to be appreciated for more than just hard work. The Clarets failed to win any of their first 10 games following promotion but in their subsequent 10 games they have won three times and drawn four more. Their last two matches have both ended in notable draws, with Burnley fighting back from 2-0 down at Manchester City last Sunday and then coming from behind three times on Thursday in a 3-3 draw at Newcastle. Burnley manager Sean Dyche celebrates on the touchline after George Boyd secured a 3-3 draw at St James' George Boyd fires home Burnley's third goal four minutes from time to earn a point at Newcastle . Prior to the last week they had only scored more than once in two games this season, and their growing threat in front of goal is just one of the areas in which Dyche's team have caught the eye. He said: 'We spoke about it last year; it was a belief we put in place as a group and then people started running with it, this idea of being relentless in how we play. 'I think it's picked up. Incredibly, if you remember, after 10 games people were saying we were negative in our approach, which I then found incredible, and I still do. 'Manuel Pellegrini, I thought, spoke fantastically about us the other day when he said afterwards how brave we are in our play and how forward-thinking we are. 'He said that in private and he said it in the press. Boyd's 86th-minute strike secured a 3-3 draw at Newcastle after Burnley had fallen behind three times . Burnley are just one point adrift in the bottom three after a hard-earned point at Newcastle . 'There are good signs of what we are trying to achieve this season, and we are trying to achieve it with a group who have more than just honesty. 'I am happy with the honesty and I am happy with the resilience and the energy and the physicality. But I think we have got some real quality and I think we showed that.' Dyche's team remain in the Premier League relegation zone but are only one point adrift of safety. They take a break from the fight for survival this weekend, with Tottenham the visitors on Monday in the third round of the FA Cup. Dyche has named the same team for six consecutive matches but will make changes, with defence a concern for the Clarets boss. He had to make three substitutions in the first half at St James' Park, with captain Jason Shackell picking up a calf injury before his replacement, Kevin Long, suffered what appeared to be a serious knee injury, while midfielder Dean Marney was unwell. With Michael Duff having missed the last month with a calf problem, that leaves on-loan Michael Keane as potentially the only fit centre-half, and Dyche must check with Manchester United that he will be allowed to play. Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini heaped praise on Sean Dyche's Burnley side after they fought back from 2-0 down to grab a point last Wednesday . Dyche's selection has stood out in contrast to a number of managers complaining about the congested schedule, but he played down the significance. He said: 'I choose a team that I think can operate to win a game, I have never really over-thought it more than that. It's up to other people. 'I believe in the whole squad and I always pick the team that I think can win a game, and it's not results-bound because you have seen, we have lost a game and then I have picked the same team. 'I must make it clear, though: every manager, every coach, every club has the right to do it how they see fit. If I need to make a change, then I make a change. '(Against Newcastle) it was forced upon us, and I am pleased with the players. 'They know how much respect I have for them, those who are on the cusp of it, the subs and then the ones beyond that and they know how much pride I have got in the way they conduct themselves around the group. 'I thought that paid them back in spades because, once they got their chance, they were excellent.'","Burnley fought back three times from going behind to secure a hard-earned point at Newcastle on Thursday .

"Once again, this was a Liverpool performance that lacked conviction. Once again, this was a Liverpool performance that made you wonder just what their defensive training entails at their Melwood training ground. Once again, this was a Liverpool performance that posed more questions than answers for their manager Brendan Rodgers. At half-time, Liverpool had seemed well on their way to a third win in a row and although this particular showing remained lightyears away from the dynamic and eminently watchable performances of last season, it would have taken them only five points behind Manchester United and within touching distance of the top four. Rodgers’ side, however, do not resemble a team capable of challenging for Champions League football, despite the best efforts of Arsenal and Manchester United to invite them back into the race. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Big Match Stats . Leicester City's Jeffrey Schlupp celebrates after scoring the goal to make it 2-2 against Liverpool at Anfield . Schlupp strikes the ball past Simon Mignolet on the hour mark to equalise for Leicester . It is a measure of Liverpool’s difficulties this season that a victory here - following successes over Burnley, Swansea City - would have represented their longest winning sequence in the Barclays Premier League this season. In truth, they were lucky to escape from this game with a point. Leicester hit the post inside the opening exchanges when Simon Mignolet was caught cold and a Riyad Mahrez free-kick cannoned off the inside of the post. Liverpool failed to heed the warning. Further chances passed Leicester by before their hosts were granted the initiative by a referee decision that Gary Lineker described as the ‘worst ever’ on Twitter. Certainly, Wes Morgan did not help his cause by sliding in, arms outstretched and flailing like an octopus but it did strike his head and Leicester have justification to be aggrieved. For a while, there were signs that Liverpool were discovering the zest and rhythm of happier days, particularly in the speed and skill of Raheem Sterling and Coutinho. They remain the two Liverpool players most eminently capable of raising this Liverpool team when they feel the need. It was this combination that combined so beautifully to slice open the first goal, as Coutinho received the ball on the half-turn, pirouetting into space and zipping a reverse ball into the run of Sterling.

There was one wonderful effort from Jordan Henderson who arrowed a volley inches past the juncture of post and bar, almost replicating the Paul Scholes effort at Bradford City all those years. In the second half, however, all that momentum dissipated. The vulnerabilities of the 3-5-2 system were exposed by a direct Leicester outfit. Gaps appeared between the defence and midfield, defenders backed off as Gerrard and Lucas were caught too high up the pitch. At 2-2, Liverpool were the side that appeared edgy, short on confidence and unable to seize the initiative. There was a telling moment when Steven Gerrard had possession on the right flank and with those in front of him stood like statues, he gestured furiously for some movement. A familiar groan rang out from those fans around the Press box. They have seen this ordinary level of performance far too often this season.

"Crystal Palace players are surprised Alan Pardew has decided to take over at Selhurst Park after his achievements at Newcastle. Joe Ledley thinks he and his team-mates are 'lucky' to be under the charge of the 53-year-old, who was named Premier League manager of the month in November. Pardew was officially announced as the new Palace boss on Saturday, completing a move that initially shocked many but became clearer when the circumstances of his working conditions on Tyneside emerged. Joe Ledley says Crystal Palace players are 'lucky' to have Alan Pardew as their manager at Selhurst Park . Pardew was officially unveiled as Palace boss on Saturday after his move from Newcastle was finalised . At Palace, Pardew will have greater control on transfers and enjoy a heathier relationship with the club's fans, who remember his winning goal in the 1990 FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool. Palace travel to Dover Athletic on Sunday in a potential FA Cup banana skin, before focussing on Premier League survival from their position in the bottom three. 'We are looking forward to working under Alan and I think we have a bright future ahead of us,' said Ledley. 'He came in at the end of the New Year's Day game and said 'Congratulations.' He told us what he wants to do with the squad which is move it forwards. He's very experienced in the Premier League. We will take his views on board and go from there. Midfielder Ledley, here in the 0-0 stalemate against Aston Villa on New Year's Day, said Palace have a 'bright future ahead' under former Selhurst star Pardew . 'I think it's a great appointment. I think we are lucky to be working under him. He has been brilliant for Newcastle. He's done such a good job that I think everyone was a bit surprised he's come. But it's a good appointment and it's down to us players now to perform. 'For us players, it's going to give us a big lift. The fans are going to be happy, so hopefully we can start putting a few good performances in. 'Tony Pulis brought me in and did a fantastic job. I thought he would be here for a long time. Things didn't work out and that's football. Hopefully we have the right man who will be here for many years to come. I think that's what the club needs.'

Ledley says players and fans are happy with the appointment of Pardew by chairman Steve Parish (right) Dover, of the Vanarama Conference, are unbeaten in 16 games and Ledley expects a real test. 'Everyone expects us to win. It's not as easy as that. They are playing against a Premier League team and hopefully we can match them for enthusiasm and put on a performance. 'It's going to be hard with the number of games we have played and the circumstances. But it could be a confidence-boost.

"Hull put the damp squib of 2014 behind them in spectacular fashion by running roughshod over a miserable Everton in a manner not properly reflected by the scoreline. Ahmed Elmohamady and former Toffee Nikica Jelavic scored the first-half goals that secured the points although Hull’s star man was their Uruguayan forward Abel Hernandez, who dazzled with his best performance of the season at the heart of everything good about the hosts. And then there was Everton; poor, sorry, shambolically defensive Everton, losing a fourth game on the bounce to leave their campaign beached if not quite mired in a relegation battle. They improved from woeful in the first half to mediocre in the second but something is badly awry in Roberto Martinez’s team and needs fixing, quickly.

Hull move up to 15th with the win . How Elmohamady opened the scoring for Hull against Everton . Hull had a peculiar 2014 to say the least, triumphant in as much as they reached the FA Cup final and retained their Premier League status, but poor for long spells, especially at home, worryingly so this season. In the calendar year they played 18 home league games and won a pitiful three all year, and one this season. Their win-draw-loss statistics at the KC Stadium were 3-4-11, or relegation standard when it is almost inevitably a struggling team’s home form that keeps them. They finished the year with another home reverse, 1-0 to Leicester on Sunday, and the dreadful showings at home were a large part of why they started the day hovering above the relegation zone. Steve Bruce had responded to suggestions before the game that he was among candidates for the manager’s job at Newcastle by saying he was ‘flattered’ but ruled himself out. ‘I’m determined to see this through with Hull and make sure we stay in the Premier League,’ he said.

Alcaraz walks off down the tunnel past his manager Martinez after being dismissed in the 86th minute for a second bookable offence . The Everton players look dejected as they wait for Hull players to return to their positions after the opening goal . His first game of a new year duly began with four changes to the starting XI from the Leicester loss, with Liam Rosenoir dropped to the bench after an achilles problem, Robbie Brady and Sone Aluko both benched and Stephen Quinn injured. In came James Chester and Andy Robertson to defence while Hernandez and former Everton front man Jelavic both returned, as the pairing up top. Rosenoir was on the field inside 23 minutes in any case, replacing Robertson, off with a hamstring pull. Everton came into the game on the back of three straight league defeats and with just one win in seven in what is easily Martinez’s most troubling spell in charge since taking over from David Moyes in the summer of 2013. There is a gag that is becoming a common refrain and holds no amusement for Everton supporters but it is painful because it is true: Martinez’s team is starting to defend like his leaky Wigan of old. Five changes from the XI who started in last weekend’s 3-2 defeat to Newcastle included Sylvain Distin dropping to the bench and Luke Garbett dropping off the radar altogether. Aiden McGeady was also benched, along with Samuel Eto’o, while James McCarthy was injured. The quintet coming in - Phil Jagielka, Muhamed Besic, Kevin Mirallas, Steven Naithsmith and Ross Barkley - did so into a rare and peculiar 3-4-1-2 that had Gareth Barry as part of a three-man defensive line with Seamus Colman and Leighton Baines on the flanks of a midfield four. Everton looked the livelier for all of two minutes as Besic charged down the right and set up Arouna Kone, whose cutback found nobody, and then it was pretty much Hull for most of the first half.

Roberto Martinez holds his arms out as he watches his side concede twice in the first half to fall to another defeat . Bruce’s men should have had a penalty in the third minute when Barry fouled Hernandez, replays confirming it was inside the area. Instead a free-kick was given on the edge of the box as Jelavic smacked it high and over. Hernandez then dispossessed Barkley and whipped in a shot, forcing Joel Robles into a smart pushed save. Everton had plenty of possesion and did not much with it, Mirallas’s long-range shot, high, being a case in point. The visitors also had a penalty shout when Barkley was squished by two defenders running towards the area but nothing was given and it was far from conclusive. With Rosenoir on for Robertson and Hernandez causing all sorts of distractions, it was a matter of time before Hull made their efforts count. In the 33rd minute they did, Elmohamady outjumping Baines to meet Rosenoir’s cross with a header to the bottom right corner. Hull were close to doubling the lead eight minutes later when Rosenoir and Hernandez combined, the latter’s shot blocked, and did double it shortly afterwards as Jelavic ran onto Hernandez’s ball over the top and lobbed Robles. Martinez needed to change something, urgently, and he made a double change at half-time, bringing on £28m summer signing Romelu Lukaku and Bryan Oviedo. That changed the dynamic of the match, with Everton finally creating chances. Just not converting them. Lukaku had efforts missed and saved, Barkley was thwarted more than once and Naismith had a good chance blocked. And still Hull came back, Hernandez absolutely outstanding and they pushed for more goals on this bright dawn of a new year.

Afterwards, Martinez claimed he ‘loves the pressure’ as he was forced to bat away concerns that he could be the next Premier League manager to be sacked. Martinez insisted: ‘I know my team has quality. The reality is we are low on confidence and once the goal goes in, we are a completely different side. It’s a new year, a fresh year and (we need to) quickly turns things around.’ Bruce, happy to see the end of a difficult 2014, said: ‘It’s been probably our best performance. ‘We’ve seen glimpses of it but from the first minute to the 90th there was a determination that it was going to be our day.’ He was full of praise for Hernandez, whose season has been disrupted by trips to South America for international duty and the birth of his child. ‘He’s found it difficult,’ Bruce said. ‘We’ve needed to give him time. I think he’s proved what a good player he can be for us.’ Bruce confirmed he is interested in signing former England forward Jermain Defoe, 32, this month. ‘You ask any club in the bottom of the division, all of us would say “yes”,’ he added. ‘Whether we can do it financially is another problem. But if he becomes available, which I believe he is, then we’d love to do something.’","Hull City edged away from the relegation zone after beating Everton at the KC Stadium on Thursday .

"Leicester boss Nigel Pearson insists the start of the managerial merry-go-round has not put him under any more pressure. Newcastle visit the King Power Stadium in the FA Cup on Saturday with Magpies assistant John Carver at the helm with Alan Pardew poised for a return to Crystal Palace. The sacking of Neil Warnock at Selhurst Park was followed almost immediately by the dismissal of Alan Irvine at West Brom and Pearson would appear to be the one now most under threat with his side bottom of the Premier League and four points from safety. Nigel Pearson, pictured on the touchline against Liverpool, admits he could be sacked by the club's owners . Leicester's Jeffrey Schlupp celebrates scoring his side's equaliser against Liverpool on New Year's Day . A cup game is probably the last thing he wants having taken an important four points from their last two matches but knows his future will not be decided on whether Leicester are successful in the knock-out competition. And the fact Newcastle are currently in a state of flux will not affect his planning for the game. 'I probably won't change my approach at all,' he said. 'Unfortunately before Christmas there were none and now there are three of four (managerial) changes. 'Football has been blighted with too many changes - this season has been slightly different, but one goes and it seems to be a signal for changes. 'I can't spend too much time analysing how that works out as I am sure John Carver will be preparing his home town side very well. 'All I can do is focus on our own situation. I will always do the job I feel is correct for us but it is inevitable as a manager you will lose your job. Everton fan David Nugent scored a stunning goal for Leicester against Liverpool at Anfield . Pearson will come up against Newcastle caretaker boss John Carver in the FA Cup on Saturday . 'What I know about our owners is we have a very good personal and working relationship and their decision will always be based on what is right for the club. 'I am in no position to argue any different to any other manager. They will do what is right. 'Clearly our priority is the Premier League.' Pearson will make a number of changes for the cup match as he tries to lessen the effect of four matches over the festive period. While a win against Newcastle would provide an important confidence-booster the Foxes boss believes his side have already shown they can compete against established Premier League clubs. 'It is fair to say we have made a number of changes through this period of games but there is no right or wrong way to do it,' he said. 'To play against Newcastle at home gives us the chance to build on some decent results but it is inevitable there will be changes. Leicester fans celebrate in the background after Schlupp's impressive strike against Brendan Rodgers' side . 'But throughout the season I don't think you've heard me talk about disappointing performances. 'It is never easy to sell the idea to people that the belief and commitment is there and we think we are good enough. 'It is about results and we had a testing second half to 2014 and we have to see what we can do for the remainder of the season. 'As a side coming up it is never easy to compete at the same level against established Premier League clubs but all the sides who were promoted last season have shown ability over the last few weeks to get results. 'We have to try to build on that. We are still not in a great position but we have to build on the positives we have had and not concentrate on what people are saying.

"Anthony Taylor ended 2014 with a refereeing call that had Jose Mourinho crying conspiracy and has started the new year on the receiving end of an almighty attack from Garry Monk. Swansea’s manager was so angry with two decisions here that he went as far as to suggest the official should serve a suspension, having already claimed he is ‘losing faith’ in referees as a collective. It was powerful stuff from a man who frequently in his press briefing said: ‘I am limited in what I can say.’ Not that such gripes from Monk are anything new, even if he has often been in the right.

QPR keeper Rob Green appeared to handle the ball outside the area after intercepting a Wayne Routledge attack . There were two such incidents in this game and Monk thinks Taylor got both of them wrong. He was incredulous that Rob Green could stay on the pitch after six minutes when he handled outside the box to stop Wayne Routledge. And he was furious that Taylor then sent off Routledge four minutes from full-time for kicking out at Karl Henry. For good measure, he also accused Henry of being ‘reckless’ in performing the ‘leg-breaker’ of a tackle that drove Routledge to retaliate. Among it all, it was almost possible to forget that Wilfried Bony came off the bench to score a stoppage-time leveller after Leroy Fer’s stunning opener after 20 minutes. For Monk, though, the sense of frustration is getting unbearable, having already seen Jonjo Shelvey handed a retrospective four-game ban this week. This kick out on Henry from Wayne Routledge earned the Swansea forward a straight red card in the second-half at Loftus Road .

Both sets of players get involved following Routledge's dismissal late in the draw at Loftus Road as Joey Barton confronts the winger . He said: ‘I am losing a bit of faith and so are my players when we continuously have decisions like this. ‘I just hope that Wayne’s card gets rescinded. He goes from nearly having a leg broken to being sent off. He (Routledge) nudges him (Henry) away. No justice whatsoever. ‘With the other one (Rob Green’s handball) it is a half metre outside the box. The linesman has a clear view. Not sure how you miss that. We have a lot of people missing things. I am tired of talking about it. ‘I have been involved 20 years in professional football. I understand you get bad decisions but we seem to get a succession of bad ones. 'I have asked the referee to help rescind it (Routledge’s red card) which will be the right thing for us and football.’ Asked if officials should serve a suspension for game-changing errors, Monk added: ‘I lose a player and I have to suffer so officials should suffer as well.’ While his claims about Routledge’s red card are more dubious, there was no doubting Green was lucky to stay on for the first infringement after six minutes. Routledge had gone clean through after a flick from  Sigurdsson and went to round Green. The goalkeeper was outside his area and handled; the referee who wrongly booked Chelsea’s Cesc Fabregas for diving against Southampton on Sunday guaranteed himself more flak.

Utterly incompetent on the road, where they have lost all their matches, their form at Loftus Road has been the saving grace. They led here after 20 minutes through a sublime finish from Fer and Zamora then blew a chance to double the lead. What followed should, perhaps, have caused Monk as much anxiety as the refereeing. Certainly, his words about Taylor should not disguise the profligacy of his attackers on a day when they had 24 shots and only scored with the last. Dutchman Fer (right) was the man of the mMatch at Loftus Road, narrowly missing out on guiding QPR to another win . Bony, surprisingly, was left on the bench, even though Monk later insisted it was nothing to do with speculation that the striker is a target for Manchester City. In his place, Gomis proved more mobile but not nearly as effective in front of goal. He missed all manner of chances. For a while the misses appeared decisive. QPR had missed plenty of their own, but with only 40 per cent of the possession were clinging on. Their chances improved when Routledge saw red but then a Bony sucker punch. Redknapp said: ‘It’s a big blow. It happened here with Liverpool in the last second when we should have drawn. ‘These were two vital points that we deserved and needed but couldn’t hang on.’ A new year and the same old gripes.

'We can go there with no fear, you want to go into the game with no fear but we very much respect what Stoke can do and we are very aware of what they can do to teams, and one thing you don't want to do is go there and be on the end of a real good thumping, but the gulf between what they are and the money they can spend and what we spend is huge.

However, one thing Wilkin is not banking on is local lad Hughes underestimating his men. 'I am sure Mark won't take anything for granted, and that is the reason why they are having such a fantastic season and Mark Hughes is the manager he is,' he added.

"Given what Tony Pulis has coped with before, the fact he calls the West Bromwich Albion job his toughest to date speaks volumes. Harder than lifting Crystal Palace from bottom of the Premier League, six points adrift, to an 11th-placed finish in a limited time. Harder than reshaping Stoke from Championship also-rans to top-flight heavy hitters, because of expectations. VIDEO Scroll down to see Tony Pulis on 'the right club at the right time' Tony Pulis was unveiled as West Brom's new manager on Friday, as the club look to avoid relegation . Pulis (left) has never suffered relegation during his 22 years of management so far . Pulis has a remarkable record of never suffering relegation in 22 years of management, but he slapped down any notion West Brom, one point and one place above the drop zone, had suddenly found salvation. ‘Just because I’ve walked in the door doesn’t mean this club will stay up,’ was his stark assessment. ‘I think complacency is one of the worst words in the dictionary. ‘A lot of those people who are saying it haven’t been involved in trying to do it. It’s not easy. It’s a compliment, brilliant, but I’d rather have it at the end of the season. ‘There will be more pressure on the players to perform here than at Palace. And it’s such a short period. You have to give the chairman a lot of credit because he understands how serious the situation is.’ Pulis takes charge of the Baggies who sit 17th in the Premier League with 18 points from 20 games currently . Prime among his tasks is energising the Hawthorns, which has been febrile for some time off the back of just four league wins at home in 2014. He wants to act decisively in the transfer market and has identified targets to aid a team he watched earn a point at West Ham on New Year’s Day. ‘The one thing I said to them was at times I didn’t think they were positive enough,’ Pulis revealed. ‘There were times when we broke and had really good opportunities but instead of taking people on they were looking for that pass.’ Rob Kelly and Keith Downing will be in the dug-out today for the visit of Gateshead in the FA Cup alongside David Kemp, brought in by Pulis, who will watch from the stands.

Star striker Saido Berahino (left) could be sold this January transfer window depending on the offer . Berahino (centre right) scored West Brom's equaliser against the Hammers on New Year's Day . He is ready to work with technical director Terry Burton to bring in players and will be supplied with funds by chairman Jeremy Peace. ‘I’ve got one or two in mind who I think can help us but we’re not down the line with any of them at this moment. It’s a very busy month for coming and going.’ Peace has previously said Saido Berahino, scorer of the equaliser at Upton Park, would not be going anywhere this month. However, Burton opened the door a little with Pulis now on the scene. ‘Tony is a totally realistic manager,’ said Burton. ‘He will work whatever way is best for the club. He tries to win matches and if he needs to sell somebody to do something else he will sell. Saido is worth what some club would pay for him.’ Even as things stand, West Brom require a striker of substance, as well as pace and genuine width. Pulis, 56, insisted he was happy with the structure of West Brom and his ‘head coach’ role - even if his style is very much as manager. Pulis says he has spoken to his sacked predecessor Alan Irvine about life at West Brom . ‘You can call me head bottle washer if you want, the title doesn’t make a difference,’ he said. ‘As long as I know there are specific areas I’m in charge of. Everyone understands our position. We have to be together to make sure the club stays up. ‘I worked with John Rudge at Stoke for 10 years. He was director of football and was never a problem. I’ve known Terry 20-odd years - I’ve no problem.’ Interestingly, Pulis spoke to Alan Irvine after he was sacked to do his homework on the club. He also spoke to former head coach Roy Hodgson and admitted comparisons were fair. ‘I think Roy likes being out working with players. We are Fifties children brought up the right way!’ he said. ‘You have different principles and ideas on life. People talk about three games in six days, but you compare what people go through in life to the players and it is laughable.’ The hard work for West Brom starts now.","Tony Pulis was appointed West Brom manager on New Year's Eve .

"Ronny Deila insists he does not care if Celtic edge the title by a single point – so long it's part of a domestic Treble. The Parkhead side find themselves embroiled in a title joust for the first time in three years, with second placed Aberdeen just two points behind going into the New Year.

'I don't care if it's one point or ten points as long as we win the Treble. 'It's all about trophies. No-one asks how many points do you win by, it's all about trophies.

Accepting Celtic are engaged in a genuine title dogfight for the first time since the financial collapse of Rangers, the Norwegian said he understands the importance of retaining the title. 'Of course, I say it all the time – winning the league is the most important thing here and that's what we are aiming to do,' he said. It was a feisty affair with tempers flaring on both sides as bottom side Ross County held Celtic on Saturday . 'I'm totally aware about the demands for the league – that's from everyone here at the club. 'The mentality is to win and we are leading. We are ahead and if we win by 20 points that's good but the most important thing is to win. 'I think it's a transitional period. You have to compare us with the team in the first year of the previous manager. 'It's not fair to judge me against last season, If I can be here for four years then hopefully I can keep going and get a better and better team. 'We are top of the league and fighting for every single trophy in this country and still in Europe but I'm totally aware of the pressures to win the league and that's the most important thing.' Leigh Griffiths lies dejected on the floor after a missed opportunity in the 0-0 draw with Ross County . Aberdeen face St Johnstone at Pittodrie tomorrow with the chance to go top before Celtic kick-off at 5.30pm against Partick Thistle at Firhill. Deila believes the Pittodrie side are equipped to put his side under pressure. 'They have consistency and they won a trophy last year. They are a big club and of course they have a chance,' he explained. 'But we have to do everything we can to make sure they can't cope with it. 'We can't do anything about Aberdeen or Dundee United. We just have to win games and go on a run of good games. 'If you take the last 10 games, they have been good.

"Dave Ki staged a dramatic return to the Rangers power battle on Friday in a move that places huge pressure on the current boardroom regime. The South Africa-based businessman purchased a near 15 per cent stake in the club by buying up shares held by fund managers Artemis and Miton. Former Ibrox director King is acting independently of the group comprising wealthy supporters Douglas Park, George Letham and George Taylor, who bought out Laxey Partners earlier this week to raise their total holding to 19 per cent. Dave King (centre) watches the Champions League clash between Liverpool and Real Madrid in October . However, the two parties share similar aims and could count on further support from various fan factions and other figures associated with the club who have a combined stake in excess of 10 per cent. Sportsmail believes that one of the parties may also have negotiated proxies from an institution to further increase an emerging power base that could force a New Year revolution. A call for an extraordinary general meeting aimed at removing current directors is now a real possibility. However, it was claimed on Friday that one shareholder has lodged a complaint with the takeover commission, believing King is working in concert with the Park consortium in a bid to seize control. Takeover panel rules dictate that if a consortium crosses the 29.9 per cent threshold it must make an offer to buy the rest of the company. King and the Park-Letham-Taylor group have 34 per cent between them but are adamant they are separate entities. King had previously spearheaded a £16million investment package that was rejected by the Rangers board in favour of a £2m loan from Newcastle owner Mike Ashley, subsequently raised to £3m. The Ibrox club is now facing a financial crisis, admitting on Friday that cash received from the £1m sale of Lewis Macleod to Brentford ‘will be used for immediate working capital’. Asked why he had moved, King told Sportsmail: ‘Because the board rejected my attempts to issue new shares to me and thereby get much-needed money into the club, which was my stated preference.’ Rangers captain Lee McCulloch applauds the club's travelling fans after their humiliating 4-0 defeat by Hibs . He stressed a willingness to work with any ‘like-minded’ group but stated he would ‘consult with other stakeholders before deciding’ future plans. King claimed his move was not influenced by the acquisition made by Park, Letham and Taylor but by ‘the availability of shares’. Of the decision to sell by Artemis and Miton, he added: ‘I believe they just lost faith in the present board and its ability to move the club forward.’ Subsequently asked whether an EGM was a likelihood in terms of bringing about boardroom change, King replied: ‘It may become necessary.’ Laxey Partners chairman Colin Kingsnorth said earlier this week that his firm had sold up to Park, Letham and Taylor to provide credible opposition to Ashley’s ambitions at Ibrox. The Sports Direct tycoon currently owns around nine per cent of Rangers and is limited to a 10-per- cent stake by a past agreement with the SFA. The governing body rejected a move for that to be increased to 29.9 per cent on Christmas Eve and Ashley’s next move is still awaited. He already has ally Derek Llambias in position as chief executive at Ibrox, while Sports Direct executive Barry Leach has been tipped to become finance director. However, asked how he viewed Ashley’s influence on the future of the club, King replied: ‘He has no real interest in the club — only in Sports Direct. I don’t view him as being significant going forward.’ King (third right), a former Rangers director, pictured at Ibrox with the league trophy in May 2010 . Second-placed Rangers are 15 points adrift of Hearts at the top of the Scottish Championship . A statement from Rangers to the Stock Exchange confirmed King’s share purchase and the vehicle he had used. It read: ‘The company was informed on 2 January 2015 that New Oasis Investments Limited, a company 100% owned by the Family Trust of Dave King, acquired 11,869,505 ordinary shares in the company on 2 January 2015.’ ‘Following the transaction, New Oasis will be interested in 11,869,505 ordinary shares in the company, representing approximately 14.57 per cent of the issued share capital.’ Ashley has previously received backing from a 26-per-cent shareholding block for which Sandy Easdale holds voting rights. The Rangers football board chairman could now find his position under threat, as could brother James — a non-executive director — and PLC chairman David Somers. Sandy Easdale and King became locked in a war of words after the latter’s investment offer was turned down. But Easdale family adviser Jack Irvine said on Friday: ‘Sandy is pleased Dave King has shown goodwill and bought these shares and he hopes it leads to further investment in the club.’ A Stock Exchange statement from Rangers earlier yesterday formally confirmed the purchase by Park, Letham and Taylor.

"Manchester City take a break from their revitalised title challenge to begin their latest FA Cup quest this weekend. The Barclays Premier League champions host Sky Bet Championship side Sheffield Wednesday in the third round of the knockout competition on Sunday. It is the second time City have faced the Owls this season, having thrashed them 7-0 in the Capital One Cup in September. VIDEO Scroll down to see Pellegrini speak about the importance of the FA Cup . Manchester City are flying high in the Premier League and are challenging Chelsea for top spot . Manuel Pellegrini insists his side are focused on the FA Cup after missing out on the Capital One Cup . Now City are in even greater form having gone unbeaten in their last 12 games, winning 10 of them. Their hot sequence has seen them claw back an eight-point deficit to draw level with Chelsea in the Premier League and reach the knockout stages of the Champions League. It seems a daunting task for Wednesday but, coming soon after the draining Christmas programme, manager Manuel Pellegrini is taking nothing for granted. The Chilean said: 'It has been a difficult moment because we played three games in a week, very important games in the Premier League. 'We had to play for nine points in one week but we have finished that and now we must think about Sheffield Wednesday. 'For our team it is a very important cup. Last year we were eliminated here against Wigan but we won the Capital One Cup. 'This year we are eliminated from the Capital One so we will try to continue in the FA Cup as far as we can.' City were knocked out by Wigan in the last year and the Pellegrini is determined not to see a repeat . Sheffield Wednesday will be hoping to repeat Wigan's heroics at the Etihad Stadium this weekend . City were knocked out of the Capital One Cup by Newcastle in October amid a poor spell that saw them win just once in six games. That brought scrutiny of Pellegrini and his methods but doubts appear to have been swept away by City's form since the November international break. It was at a similar stage last season when City began to click into top gear. Pellegrini said: 'For different reasons we had a low performance for around two weeks. 'We were not playing so bad in that moment but we made important mistakes and when you make mistakes the score is not what you want. After that, we arranged again the way we were playing. 'Important players returned to their normal performance and I am very happy with the way we are playing now. 'We still have so many injured players but we arrange in different ways and continue winning.' Vincent Kompany is nearing a return but won't be fit in time for the third round clash . Joe Hart could be on the sidelines again this weekend with Pellegrini hinting Willy Caballero will retain his place . Influential captain Vincent Kompany and strikers Sergio Aguero and Edin Dzeko are the key players currently sidelined. Kompany is thought to be the closest to a return after calf and hamstring problems but has been ruled out of the Wednesday clash. Dzeko and Aguero are expected to return later in January. Midfielder Yaya Toure could face Wednesday in what would be his final appearance before joining up with Ivory Coast for the African Nations Cup. Pellegrini has hinted that second-choice goalkeeper Willy Caballero is likely to remain in the side after England number one Joe Hart was rested against Sunderland on New Year's Day. Pellegrini said: 'It is important when you play so many games - not only for Joe but for other players - to have an important rotation. 'I did the same in the Capital One for Willy Caballero. I think it's good for Willy, good for Joe and good for the team. It's exactly the same as other positions in the team.'","Manchester City host Sheffield Wednesday in the FA Cup third round .

The 23-year-old former Parkhead youth player has suffered from various ailments since making his debut as substitute - and scoring - in a 4-0 win over Motherwell on May 1, 2010. Forrest's undoubted talents have won him international recognition with Scotland but, since taking over from Neil Lennon in the summer, Deila has still to see the best of the player who has made 10 appearances in 10 months. James Forrest (left) has endured an injury-ravaged few years at Celtic Park . But manager Ronny Deila insists he will continue to keep faith in the 'special' talent that is Forrest . A knock picked up in the recent 2-1 Scottish Premiership defeat by Dundee United at Tannadice meant he missed the goalless draw against Ross County on Saturday. However, Forrest will return to the squad for the trip to Partick Thistle on New Year's Day, and the Celtic boss explained why he is nursing the player back to full fitness. Deila said: 'He is a special boy that we need to take more care of, more than a lot of the others because he has been out for a long time. 'He has been out for 550 days in the last four years, which is almost two years, so you need to take it slowly and build it up again. 'Now he has been injury-free for two months. He got this little one (injury) but it is nothing serious. So this is going very well. Forrest (right) scores at Celtic Park . 'If you push him too hard then he is going to be out again. 'He has progressed. Against Dundee United he was more active than he was before but you need consistency over time to get the best out of James. 'The problem has been pulled muscles so we need to get his fitness up. 'It is one thing is to run, another to play football. You get football fitness by getting on the pitch. 'But he is in a good place now. He played 90 minutes against Dundee United and I think you have to go back a long time for his last 90 minutes. 'We want quick steps but we have to be careful.' The 23-year-old (right) suffered his most-recent injury in the loss to Dundee United on December 21 . The loss of five points in Celtic's last two games meant Aberdeen were able to move to within two points of the champions with their 1-0 win at Inverness on Sunday. The Dons could go top of the table against St Johnstone on January 1, at least until the Hoops take on Partick at Firhill later in the day. Deila denied that his side go into 2015 in poor form but admits 'stupid' points lost early in the season have hampered title aspirations. The Norwegian said: 'I don't think we have been poor. In the last 10 (league) games we have had eight victories and one defeat and one draw. Forrest runs off in celebration after scoring against Motherwell at Celtic Park in September 2011 . 'And we have should have taken something out of the game in which we got beat. 'In the last two games we haven't taken the points we wanted but we are controlling games. 'Aberdeen are on a good run and they are a good team but we have to concentrate on ourselves and continue winning games and then the other team has to be very good to cope with us. 'I had hoped for more points. We lost some stupid points at the beginning of the season, but in the last weeks we have been quite consistent and we are controlling games more than we did before.'","James Forrest has endured an injury-jinxed few seasons at Celtic .

"Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba would the 'ideal replacement' for Steven Gerrard, according to former Liverpool forward Michael Owen. At 34-years-old, Gerrard's value to Brendan Rodgers' side is coming under increasing scrutiny, but the lack of candidates to ill his role is a concern for many at the club.

"Rangers defender Darren McGregor is determined to catch Hearts - because he does not want his Ibrox legacy to be a failed promotion bid. The Light Blues trail the Scottish Championship-leading Jambos by 15 points, meaning they may have to negotiate a potentially tricky route through the play-offs if they are to regain their top-flight spot. Having lost to play-off rivals Hibs - who stunned caretaker boss Kenny McDowall's side with a 4-0 hammering - and Queen of the South last month, there is no guarantee Gers would even make it through to the two-legged decider with the side finishing second bottom of the Premiership. Darren McGregor is determined to catch Hearts because he does not want to leave with a failed promotion bid . McGregor pictured during a training session with Scottish outfit Rangers at Murray Park . Rangers sit second behind Hearts and trail them by 15 points in the Scottish championship . And that is why McGregor says he only has eyes for Hearts. The former St Mirren defender missed two years of action in Paisley after suffering successive knee ligament injuries - but he claims missing out on promotion would be even more painful. He said: 'I've had some low points in my career. The two cruciate injuries I had were really difficult times. But this is totally different. 'This club is build on what the former players - guys with a lot of prestige - have done and we want to uphold that. We want to do that justice. 'I certainly don't want to be remembered as the guy who came in and was part of a team not to get promotion back to the Premiership. That would really hurt.' McGregor has just earned himself a one-year contract extension with the League One champions after clocking up 28 appearances in his debut campaign with the club. But he is determined not to spend his second season in the second tier. He added: 'When I first came here I was delighted to be signing for a club as big as Rangers. From where I have been and the injuries I have had I never thought it would be possible to reach the heights that I have. McGregor: 'I certainly don't want to be remembered as the guy who came in and was part of a team not to get promotion back to the Premiership' McGregor has just earned himself a one-year contract extension with the League One champions . 'The main thing now is to perform. The situation isn't great for us and for me personally, the extra year doesn't mean much unless we get promotion and I am part of a successful Rangers team. 'Automatic promotion is still an option for us. It's still mathematically possible for us to catch Hearts but I can understand from the way it looks that it will be difficult. 'Yeah Hearts have got a big lead but they could go on a bad run or we could go on a good one. Anything can happen in football. 'We need to go again and have confidence in ourselves if we are going to dig ourselves out of this position. 'I'm not going to moan about the external pressures we have here and the demands put on. You know that's what you are going to get when you sign for a club like this.' Rangers will hope to recover some pride after last Saturday's capital calamity when they face Dumbarton on Saturday. The team are still adjusting to life without boss Ally McCoist after he was put on garden leave for the rest of his 12 month notice period, while the off-field battle for control continues with Wednesday's news that the Three Bears - Douglas Park, George Letham and George Taylor - had bought out the club's biggest shareholder, Laxey Partners. But you will not see McGregor using any of that as an excuse for Gers' Leith implosion. Rangers will hope to recover some pride after last Saturday's capital calamity when they face Dumbarton . 'We know it wasn't acceptable for a club like this to put in a performance like that,' he said. 'We have not got a given right to win games but we were miles short of the standards that have been set throughout this club. 'We could give you a load of excuses but at the end of the day it was not good enough.' However, a team already short on creative flair has suffered another blow when Lewis Macleod was sold off to Brentford for an undisclosed fee. McDowall believes he can cope without the Scotland Under-21 midfielder and McGregor has urged those waiting for their chance to grasp it. He said: 'I really like wee Lewis. He's a talented boy and I wish him all the best. 'I still think we have got strength in depth so as every door closes, it's one opening for other boys. You look at our bench and there are guys there definitely capable of stepping up.'","Rangers defender Darren McGregor is determined to catch Hearts .

"Scot Gemmill once overheard someone ask Jack Harper if he could speak Spanish. ‘He was born in Spain!’ laughs the Scotland youth coach, highlighting the irony of the 18-year-old’s decision to represent the county of his parents’ birth. Harper was born in Fuengirola, a holiday town near Malaga, and could have been forgiven for ensconcing himself in La Roja’s fabled youth set-up — it is not like they weren’t interested. Who could have blamed him? It would arguably have accelerated his technical development, perhaps even burnished his standing at Real Madrid, where he has made impressive progress through their academy. But he didn’t. He chose Scotland. James Harper has impressed for Real Madrid and looks set for a bright future . The 18-year-old was born in Spain but has pledged his allegiance towards Scotland . Mark Wotte says that he sees a lot of similarities between Harper and a young Robin van Persie . The influence of his patriotic parents, dad John and mum Tracey — from Barrhead — must be acknowledged and it is significant that Harper speaks in a Scottish accent. He returns regularly to visit relatives and has an emotional attachment strong enough to board a plane to Scotland whenever his Madrid contemporaries head to Las Rozas, the Spanish national team’s football factory in Madrid, during international breaks. As a young teenager, he was around Scotland’s Under-16 Victory Shield squad. As he grew physically, so did the Scottish Football Association’s involvement, spearheaded by Mark Wotte, who visited Madrid to check on his progress. There, he found a player very much part of the Spanish giants’ development plans. ‘It’s not really certain whether Jack is a No 9 or 10,’ explained Wotte, the former SFA performance chief. ‘So Real Madrid told me: “He is a nine-and-a-half. We love him, but he is a strange player.” I had the same situation with Robin van Persie when I was Under-19 coach of Holland. It was difficult to position him. I see a lot of similarities with Jack. They have a similar style of running and body shape, creativity in and around the box, and the awareness to score goals. But there is still a big gap between where Jack is now and Robin.’ Wotte has never been slow to make the van Persie comparison but he is not predicting that Harper’s career will follow the same trajectory as the Dutchman’s, only that there are points of connection, both physically and technically. He is right. Harper is tall — just over 6ft — and has a similarly languid, straight-backed style to van Persie; he is also technically adept and good in the air with a strong tactical awareness. The latter aspect is picked up on by Gemmill, who has worked with Harper in national youth squads and himself moved to Spain for a year to study coaching. But Wotte does concede that Harper has a long way to go if he is to emulate Van Persie . ‘Because Jack grew up in Spain, he’s always played a continental style of football, where the game is played at a slower pace and there is an emphasis on tactics,’ says Gemmill. ‘That approach is evident all the way through in Spain. From small-sided games, young players are taught to be tactically aware and that everything has a knock-on effect. Being immersed in that way for his whole life has had a big effect on Jack. It’s in his DNA.’ Harper’s football intelligence has shone through in this season’s UEFA Youth League, with goals home and away to FC Basel, another in a 3-2 loss to Liverpool, and two assists, helping Madrid to finish top of their group and ensure a last-16 place. His performances have also reportedly led to interest from Liverpool and Manchester City. For a flash of his technical ability, a YouTube search for ‘Jack Harper backheel’ brings up his exquisite assist for the Juvenil A side earlier this month. Harper (pictured in action for Scotland Under 17s two years ago) wants to play for his parents' homeland . Scotland fans will have to be patient, though. He has yet to kick a ball in senior football and there remains a yawning chasm between Juvenil A and the Los Blancos first-team squad, though Harper has at least got to mix with world-class talents such as Karim Benzema, Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale by travelling with them on Champions League trips (the UEFA Youth League schedule tries to mirror its senior equivalent’s fixtures). A progression to Madrid’s reserve team — Castilla — in 2015 would see him work under Zinedine Zidane and Santiago Sanchez in Segunda B. While Madrid are quietly confident Harper has the ability and attitude to go all the way, the next 18 months are crucial. While Harper is hardly burdened by an inferiority complex, there have been no rumblings of arrogance or impetuosity that often accompany the emergence of a prodigious talent. ‘I would pay him the compliment of saying he is the opposite [of how people might expect a Real Madrid youngster to behave],’ says Gemmill. ‘Often players at big clubs are now allowed to act like that.’ Wotte agrees: ‘He’s a cool guy. He knows he’s not a star yet.’ Yet.","Jack Harper is one of Real Madrid's bright stars of the future .

"It may be 65 years since Yeovil Town last faced Manchester United but for one United follower, it still feels like only yesterday. For John Butterfield, 81, will be the only United supporter at Huish Park on Sunday that was also on the terraces on February 12, 1949. That was the day when Sir Matt Busby’s team hosted non-league Yeovil, the Southern League outfit that had startled top-flight Sunderland in the 4th round to secure a glamour tie against Manchester United at Maine Road. As it transpired, it was like carthorses against greyhounds as United blitzed their visitors, winning 8-0 in front of a quite remarkable crowd of 81,565. Manchester United supporter John Butterfield saw  the Red Devils take on Yeovil in 1949 at Maine Road . Butterfield paid three shillings to see Sir Matt Busby's (left) side thrash Yeovil 8-0 in front of 81,565 fans . It is the 8th biggest attendance to watch a Manchester United game and testament to just how highly the FA Cup was revered in a bygone era. ‘I will never forget that day,’ Butterfield tells Sportsmail, ‘I had a brain operation in 1996. I came off my ladder and cracked my skull. I died twice that night. That’s what the kids told me. It affects my short-term memory. I couldn’t tell you what I had for dinner yesterday but that day against Yeovil is still as clear as day. John bursts into a nostalgic smile as takes a trip down memory line: ‘They were closing the gates half-an-hour before kick-off because there were so many people. My ticket cost me 3 shillings - or 15 pence. ‘Amazing’, he adds, blowing out his cheeks. ‘The atmosphere was really special, they had all us youngsters on their shoulders, passing us forward so we could see the game. It was another world to these days. ‘Jackie Rowley scored five, Ronald Burke two, then Stan Pearson and Charlie Mitten sealed the victory.’ He has been to every United cup final since 1948 and missed just two European games in the last 15 years . Louis van Gaal will be hoping United win on Sunday as comfortably as they did back in 1949 . For Butterfield, known as ‘Old John’ by those who travel regularly with the United team - he has missed only two European away games in the last 15 years and attended every United cup final since 1948 - it was a day of special significance. ‘I was 16 and I went for a job interview for that day with my United scarf, my hat and my rattle. My mum said ‘You’ll never get a job like that.’ But I had to get to the game. I sat in the office and the manager says, “To be honest with you, Mr Butterfield, we don’t have any vacancies... but just hang on, I’m like you, I’m a Manchester United supporter. So that’s why I’m giving you a job.” So I ended up working there as an optical mechanic for the next 22 years - all to go and see Manchester United against Yeovil Town.’ Daily Mail clippings from the time reported: ‘Yeovil went home from Manchester, where the day’s biggest crowd saw them beaten 8-0 with £3,000 to add to the £2,000 they add from previous ties. Manchester United’s scoring machine clicked into action after five minutes and so brilliant was their football that the goals just had to come. Yeovil goalkeeper Stan Hall was doubly unlucky. Badly hurt after 20 minutes (a stomach cut which he said nothing about needed four stitches after the game), he found Rowley shooting “as hard as I have ever seen him”, to quote manager Sir Matt Busby.’","John Butterfield saw Manchester United beat Yeovil 8-0 in 1949 .

'I'd rather have more chance of winning than to play at Selhurst Park.' Dover assistant Mark Newson doubles as an academy coach at Palace, and embarked on an improbable Intertoto Cup campaign with Alan Pardew at Tottenham in 1995. Pardew will lead his first game with Palace after they agreed a £3.5million compensation deal with Newcastle . Pardew is expected to complete his move from Newcastle to the managerial hotseat at Palace in time to direct operations from the dugout on Sunday.

'And I didn't see anyone out there at the time that I wanted to make a three or four year commitment to, and Neil was prepared to come in and do it on a slightly shorter-term basis and help out. It felt the right thing to do and I don't think we're massively behind where we should be.' Despite that, Palace are holders of one of the relegation places in the Premier League. Three wins in their first 20 matches sees them three points off bottom, and Parish was honest in his assessment that the time was right to sack Warnock. 'I just think that we were drifting away from what we're good at. And I don't think it's the time to change things [on the pitch]. We tried to play a different formation [against] Southampton and I felt we looked a bit lost at sea at times, the crowd went flat. It's difficult then to dig yourself out of that. Pardew was at Crystal Palace's Beckenham training ground on Friday for his first day at the club . The former Crystal Palace midfielder pulls into the Eagles' training ground in Kent on Friday morning . Tony Pulis left the club before the start of the season and Parish admits he rushed into finding a replacement . Warnock (right) guided Palace into the relegation zone and Pardew (left) will be tasked with getting them out . 'Things haven't gone so well, with Tony [Pulis] going just before the start of the season, it causes upheaval. I probably didn't get the right fit with Neil, I've gotta take it on the chin for that one.' Last season, it didn't start smoothly for Palace either. Ian Holloway was in charge for the beginning of the 13/14 campaign, and it took a managerial change to kick-start things and instill some belief into the squad. This season, Parish admits, it is Burnley who have reaped the rewards of an increase in confidence. 'Burnley have got a few results. That happened to us last season, the belief grows. Tony came in and galvanised everyone around. His style fitted with our players and he did a great job. The players did a great job, the whole place was lifted, it was amazing. Parish spoke to friend and former Eagles striker Bright in a lounge at Selhurst Park . Bright quizzed the Palace chief on Warnock, the future and what the club achieved under Pulis . Saido Mane (left) scores against Crystal Palace in what turned out to be Warnock's last as Palace manager . 'That Liverpool game (when Palace drew 3-3 in May), it was the first game I was really relaxed. I remember going 3-0 down and sitting next to you (Mark Bright) on my phone and thinking, ""well, it's not great is it?"". Then Damo (Damien Delaney) loses track of where he was, and tries to cross it... 'When Yala (Yannick Bolasie) breaks past Glen Johnson, it's just... and the place was electric. So yeah, the season was great. But like I said to you before, I don't look back really, it's pointless. Enjoy it, celebrate it, then try and move on.' And Palace have moved on. Parish cracked the whip and another manager has been pushed out of the exit door at the club's Beckenham training ground. Despite their league position, there have been highlights, including a 3-1 win against Liverpool at Selhurst Park . Luis Suarez was in tears on the pitch as Crystal Palace came back from three down to draw 3-3 with Liverpool . Dwight Gayle scored his second goal late on to secure the draw for Crystal Palace at Sehurst Park . It wasn't a decision that Parish made lightly; in fact, he doesn't make any decisions at the click of a finger. 'I don't just roll the dice, ""oh lets just do that then""', the Palace chief continued. 'I really agonise over everything, chat to Stephen [Browett - Parish's co-chairman] about things endlessly, try and work out the best thing to do. We've got to make more right decisions than the rest of them to catch up. 'I'm pretty tough nut with things like that. You make decisions in football to create emotions. Right now I think we need a lift, we need something to lift the place. There's a real sense that we might lose something we've got, and the Premier League is such a fantastic place to be and we want to stay there. 'It's about tapping into those emotions to get the sense of what people feel. It shouldn't be knee-jerk.' So, starting with a trip to Dover in the FA Cup on Sunday, it is now the job of Pardew to steady the Selhurst ship. As Parish says, Palace need a lift... and Pardew, who was at the club's Beckenham training ground on Friday, may just be the man to sort it.

"Manager Arsene Wenger believes his side must lay to rest their defensive 'ghosts' before they can move forwards in 2015. The Gunners begin the defence of their FA Cup crown at home to Hull on Sunday having started the new year with a disappointing 2-0 defeat at Southampton, which left them in sixth and three points off the Champions League places. Having produced such a solid rearguard display when winning at West Ham on December 28, Arsenal were again architects of their own downfall at St Mary's with blunders from goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny compounded by poor judgements from centre-backs Laurent Koscielny and Per Mertesacker which proved so costly. Arsene Wenger says his side must lay to rest their defensive 'ghosts' before they can move forward . Wenger looking distressed during his side's 2-0 defeat to Ronaldo Koeman's (right) Southampton . Wenger is expected to rotate his squad for the FA Cup tie, with Colombia goalkeeper David Ospina already set to stand in for Szczesny, the 24-year-old Poland stopper again seeing his position as number one come under scrutiny. Arsenal host Stoke on January 11, and then travel to Manchester City - by which time Wenger knows his defence must pull themselves together. 'I cannot fault the attitude of the team, but we were again haunted by the ghost of what we have seen since the start of the season,' Wenger said on Arsenal Player. 'This is not the first time it has happened. We did not defend well enough in the final third, and we paid a heavy price. It is a self-inflicted defeat.' Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny (right) struggled during the defeat at St Mary's . Szczesny and Per Mertesacker (back) failed to keep out Sadio Mane's opener for Southampton . Mertesacker - who failed to clear a looping shot from Sadio Mane as it bounced over the line after Szczesny had rushed from his goal - accepts there will be some soul searching as the Gunners look to rediscover the form which had seen them head to Southampton on the back of just one defeat out of nine games in all competitions. 'The last two matches we were in good spirits and those games were close together (over Christmas) and we fought really hard for the two wins, but at Southampton, it was slightly different, we didn't show up with a good performance,' said the 6ft 7ins German centre-half. 'We have to come back to our main strength and we have to remind ourselves every day that we need to have a big performance.' Szczesny was then beaten by Southampton midfielder Dusan Tadic for the second of the afternoon . Laurent Koscielny (right) battles for possession with Southampton midfielder James Ward-Prowse . Striker Danny Welbeck (thigh) missed the Southampton game because of a thigh problem, and Olivier Giroud serves the last part of his three-match suspension for Sunday's cup tie. German international Lukas Podolski did not feature because of a tight groin, according to Wenger, with Inter Milan set to step up their interest when the transfer window officially opens again. Wenger said: 'I will make a few changes (against Hull), that is for sure.' Teenage forward Chuba Akpom came off the bench against Southampton, and the 19-year-old would relish another taste of first-team action this weekend. 'I am hungry for it now. I want to show the boss what I am made of and I think that I am ready,' he said. 'I think I can have a good impact on the team, hopefully I get a chance.'","Arsene Wenger says Arsenal must lay to rest defensive 'ghosts'

"Rangers have confirmed that the so-called Three Bears have snapped up Laxey Partners' 16 per cent share in the club. In a statement to the Stock Exchange on Friday morning, the club welcomed the development which sees George Taylor, George Letham and Douglas Park purchase the stake of the Isle of Man hedge fund earlier this week. It stated: 'The Company has been informed that on 31 December 2014, George Taylor, Douglas Park and George Letham acquired 5,000,000, 5,000,000 and 3,299,415 ordinary shares of 1p each respectively, representing 6.14 per cent, 6.14 per cent and 4.05 per cent of issued share capital. A DTR announcement is expected to follow in due course. Sandy Easdale (left), pictured at Easter Road on December 27, has offered a cautious welcome to investment . 'The Board of Rangers is delighted that George Taylor, an existing Significant Shareholder, and George Letham, who provided the Company with a credit facility in 2014, together with Douglas Park have demonstrated their commitment to the Company through this purchase. The Directors welcome their continued enthusiasm towards contributing to the future success of the Company and club.' In a separate announcement, the club confirmed that Lewis Macleod's transfer to Brentford – believed to be an initial £800,000 – will go towards paying ongoing costs before a more viable financial structure can be found. It read: 'The Board of Rangers announces that on 30 December 2014 Rangers Football Club entered into an agreement to sell a player, Lewis Macleod. The proceeds of the sale will be used for immediate working capital needs during the next few weeks while the directors, in consultation with the Company's major shareholders and third parties, seek a long term and stable financial solution for the club.' However, the future of the club could still depend on whether Mike Ashley is allowed to tighten his iron grasp on the Glasgow giants. Rangers are desperately short of money and need to raise £8.3m before April 1 if they are to stay afloat. Lewis Macleod has completed his move from Rangers to Championship side Brentford . Ibrox has not seen Premiership football for a number of years as Rangers attempt to climb the leagues . While the Three Bears are now positioning themselves to ride to Rangers' rescue, they may find opposition from Ashley. The Sports Direct businessman owns an 8.92 per cent stake in Rangers and controls the Glasgow giants' retail division. But the £3m emergency loan he handed the board late last year has effectively given him control of the club. He has already placed former Newcastle managing director Derek Llambias on the board and named him chief executive - and still holds the right to pick a second director. Rangers fans have protested outside Ibrox on numerous occasions at the running of their football club . However, the Scottish Football Association has already blocked Ashley's attempt to raise his stake to 29.9 per cent after ruling it would breach 'dual ownership' regulations. Ashley's next move, however, could prove crucial to the club's future. Motor group boss Park has had his wealth previously estimated at £78m, while Letham - who sits on the board of the Rangers Supporters Trust (RST) - has already loaned the club £1m earlier this year. Taylor, meanwhile, bought a 3.2 per cent stake in the club last month - meaning the consortium is now in control of 19.5 per cent of Rangers. The trio have already lodged a £6.5m offer to underwrite a share issue with the club's board. In return, they want two seats on the Rangers board. Wednesday's transaction will not see any cash flow into Rangers' coffers but it will allow the Three Bears to participate directly in any share issue taking place early in the new year. Mike Ashley's plans to take further control at Rangers have been stymied by SFA rules on dual interest . A motion at last month's AGM which would have allowed the club to raise new shares and offer them to new investors before existing shareholders was controversially defeated. Meanwhile, supporter groups say the latest developments in the Ibrox power struggle have sparked an increase in interest from supporters backing fan-ownership schemes. A spokesman for the RST - who run BuyRangers - said: 'We've had an amazing response. We've seen new life members and existing members signing up for shares as well as new members who hold shares handing them to the RST.' Organisers of Rangers First say they have seen more than 100 new fans sign up since the Three Bears made their move. A spokesman said they had seen a 'significant uptake in Rangers First memberships as fans look to do their bit to support the actions of others'.","Laxey Partners has sold its 16 per cent stake in Rangers .

"Luke Shaw insists Manchester United can still challenge for the Premier League title this year despite their recent struggles away from home. United stretched their unbeaten run to 10 matches on New Year's Day, but they only took a point away from Stoke after Radamel Falcao cancelled out Ryan Shawcross' opener. Despite the disappointing result, United's standing in the table actually improved. Manchester United left back Luke Shaw believes that his side can still win the Premier League title . Shaw clashes with Stoke City midfielder Jonathan Walters (left) while Peter Crouch watches on . Chelsea's shock defeat to Tottenham means Louis van Gaal's side are now nine points behind the Blues and joint leaders Manchester City. Shaw, therefore, feels United's title chances should not be written off. 'We are not going to say the Premier League is over yet,' the United left-back said. 'The league is still our number one priority. We want to win that. 'Coming to Stoke is always going to be a tough battle. There's a lot of balls in the air so it's tough. 'We know when we come away we have to get three points so we are not very pleased with the point.' Ryan Shawcross struck early to give Stoke City a 1-0 lead in the second minute . Radamel Falcao then equalised to level the game at 1-1 just before half time . After an injury-plagued start to life at United, Shaw is hoping to make a fresh start again in 2015. Shaw was dropped from the United team in pre-season as he was out of shape and shortly after his comeback he was out for over a month because of a hamstring injury. Then, two months after his return, Shaw suffered an ankle injury against Arsenal and was missing for six weeks. 'The main thing for me now is to get a run of games together,' the 19-year-old said. 'It was a great feeling watching the team do well when I was out. Now I am back fit I want to be a part of the winning run. 'I had 60 minutes against Stoke. That was pre-planned. If I had been able to go on longer then I would have done.' Ashley Young excelled in Shaw's position during his absence, but the former Aston Villa man suffered a hamstring injury in the 1-1 draw at the Britannia Stadium and is going to be out for 'many weeks', according to manager Louis van Gaal. Ashley Young (right) is set for a spell on the sidelines after suffering a hamstring injury against Stoke . Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal watches on during the game against Stoke at the Britannia Stadium . Shaw thinks he will have to fight hard to retain his place when Young returns. 'There's massive competition for me,' the £28million defender said. 'I think it's a big credit to Ashley Young. He has been superb, one of our best players for the last four or five matches. It's just unfortunate for him that's he got this injury now. I hope it's not too bad. I hope he comes fighting back again.' Next up for United is a trip to League One bottom side Yeovil in the third round of the FA Cup on Sunday. Yeovil became known as FA Cup giant-killers during their non-league days when they knocked no fewer than 20 league sides out of the competition. For that reason, Shaw knows United's stellar squad must not under-estimate their opponents. 'We've seen in the past that the big teams have been knocked out by lower league teams so we know it's going to be a tough game,' Shaw said. 'We're going to focus on that now because we want to go on a good cup run. That's the reason I came to Manchester United - because I want to be winning trophies.'","Left back Luke Shaw insists Manchester United can still challenge for title .

"Paris Saint-Germain forward Ezequiel Lavezzi has admitted he often thinks about quitting football for good, and will not stay in the game when he retires. There are rumours that the 29-year-old Argentinian is set to leave the French capital after two seasons, and he admits he has become disillusioned with the game he once loved. 'Sometimes I think about giving it all up. It's a thought running through my head today, not just in the past,' Lavezzi told Marca Plus. 'Once I leave football, I will not continue in the world of sport. Right now I don't know what I might do.' Paris Saint-Germain forward Ezequiel Lavezzi admits that he has become disillusioned with football . Lavezzi joined PSG from Napoli after five years at the club, and has now played over 70 times in Paris . Lavezzi, who spent five years at Napoli before moving to France, did admit that football has given him some opportunities he couldn't have had without it, but believes there is a self-centred element to footballers. 'Certainly the best thing that ties me to football is the possibility of living well, discovering new cultures, and spending time with my family when it's possible – I enjoy it all the more. 'The worst aspect of it is the environment, everyone is powered by their own interests. It's not all what it looks like from outside.' With the transfer window now open, and the likes of Liverpool and Arsenal said to be showing an interest, it would not be a surprise to see Lavezzi make a fresh start. The 29-year-old admits he will not stay in sport after he retires from playing professionally .

"The NBA once again served up a festive feast of frantic basketball action on Christmas Day with five back-to-back games featuring some of the best players and teams in the league. On the menu on Thursday was a Miami return for LeBron James with his Cleveland Cavaliers team, a Western Conference finals rematch and a West Coast showdown between the high-flying Golden State Warriors and Los Angeles Clippers. Here is our round-up of the best that the NBA had to offer on Christmas Day. THUNDER 114-106 SPURS . Russell Westbrook scored 34 points, and the Oklahoma City Thunder beat the San Antonio Spurs 114-106 on Thursday in a rematch of last season's Western Conference Finals. The Thunder earned their sixth straight regular-season victory over the defending NBA champions in the first meeting between the teams since San Antonio topped Oklahoma City in six games on the way to a fifth title. Russell Westbrook scored 34 points as the Oklahoma City Thunder beat the San Antonio Spurs . Matt Bonner led the way for the Spurs with 17 points off the bench, but San Antonio were beaten . Kevin Durant missed the game through injury for the Thunder, but they still beat the NBA champions . The Thunder was without reigning MVP Kevin Durant, and the Spurs were missing Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard, but there was still plenty of firepower. Serge Ibaka had 21 points, including going 3 for 4 on 3-pointers for Oklahoma City (14-16). Steven Adams added 16 points and 15 rebounds to offset San Antonio center Tiago Splitter matching his season-high with 14 points. Matt Bonner had 17 points to lead seven players in double figures for San Antonio (18-12), which has lost five of six. Tim Duncan had 15 points, six rebounds and five assists. CAVALIERS 91-101 HEAT . Dwyane Wade scored 24 of his 31 points in the first half, Luol Deng finished with 25 points, eight rebounds and eight assists, and the Miami Heat beat the Cleveland Cavaliers in LeBron James' first game back at his former home. Chris Andersen scored 12 for the Heat, who led by as many as 17, trailed for a moment in the fourth quarter before gathering themselves and pulling away again. LeBron James scored 30 points for the Cavaliers on his return to Miami on Christmas Day . Dwyane Wade led the way for the Miami Heat with 31 points as they won on Christmas Day . Former team-mates James and Wade embrace at the end of the game at American Airlines Arena . James scored 30 points for the Cavaliers, hugging his former team-mates before the game and after the final buzzer. It was James' first time as an opponent in Miami since he helped the Heat reach each of the last four NBA Finals, winning two titles. Kyrie Irving added 25 points, and Kevin Love scored 14 for Cleveland. Miami was again without Chris Bosh, still sidelined by a calf injury. WARRIORS 86-100 CLIPPERS . Jamal Crawford scored 12 of his 24 points in the fourth quarter, Chris Paul added 22 points, and Los Angeles handed NBA-leading Golden State its second Staples Center loss in three days. The Warriors held the Clippers to 4-for-24 shooting in the first quarter and 39.1 percent for the game, two nights after the Lakers shot 51.7 percent without Kobe Bryant to beat them 115-105. That loss ended a streak of 27 straight games by the Warriors in which they held opponents under 50 percent. Jamal Crawford led the Los Angeles Clippers to a Christmas Day victory over the Golden State Warriors . Klay Thompson scored 15 points for the Warriors, but they were suffered their fifth loss of the season . The Clippers, beginning a nine-game homestand after back-to-back losses to San Antonio and Atlanta, haven't dropped three in a row since March 29-April 1, 2013. Blake Griffin missed his first eight shots and was 5 for 16 overall with 18 points and 15 rebounds. DeAndre Jordan had 14 points and 12 boards. Klay Thompson scored 15 points, and Stephen Curry 14 for Golden State, which has lost three of five following a 23-3 start that included a franchise-record 16-game winning streak. LAKERS 93-113 BULLS . Pau Gasol had 23 points and 13 rebounds against his former team and Chicago beat Los Angeles with Lakers star Kobe Bryant resting his sore body. Jimmy Butler added 21 points, and Derrick Rose had 20 points and six assists to help the Bulls win their season-high fifth straight. Pau Gasol's 23 points led the Chicago Bulls to a comfortable win over the Los Angeles Lakers . Kobe Bryant sat out his second straight game to rest as the Lakers were beaten in Chicago . With Bryant missing his second straight game, the Lakers were unable to pull off another upset. They stunned Golden State on Tuesday night but came up short against the Central division leaders. Gasol, a two-time champion in six-plus seasons with the Lakers, was 9 of 14 from the field in his first game against Los Angeles since joining the Bulls in the summer. Wesley Johnson led Los Angeles with 19 points. WIZARDS 102-91 KNICKS . John Wall had 24 points and 11 assists, eluding the Knicks all day until getting knocked to the floor by a flagrant foul that sparked an altercation, and Washington beat New York. Wall toyed with the Knicks for 3 1/2 quarters, highlighted by a spinning, 360-degree layup, before Quincy Acy knocked him down with a forearm shove with 5:31 to play. Wall got up and pushed Acy, who responded with a punch that appeared to hit Wall behind the neck. Acy was ejected in the Christmas dust-up, and Wall received a technical foul. Bradley Beal added 17 points for the Wizards, who had their top five of Wall, Beal, Paul Pierce, Nene and Marcin Gortat in the starting lineup for the first time this season. John Wall led the Washington Wizards to victory over the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden . Carmelo Anthony scored 34 points for the Knicks, who fell to 5-26 and have the most losses in the NBA. They have dropped six straight and 16 of 17.

"Rangers caretaker boss Kenny McDowall insists he still believes the club can secure promotion this season - despite his disastrous dug-out debut. Ally McCoist's number two took charge of the side for the first time since the manager was placed on garden leave last Saturday at Easter Road. But it was a nightmare afternoon for the former Partick and St Mirren striker as Hibernian hammered his hapless team 4-0. Rangers caretaker boss Kenny McDowell believes they can still achieve promotion this season . The defeat allowed Hearts to extend their massive lead to 15 points at the top of the Scottish Championship, while Alan Stubbs' Leith side have closed to within four of the second-placed Gers. With confidence at an all-time low on the pitch and a cash crisis brewing off it, Rangers are far from guaranteed to make it back to the Premiership at the first attempt. But McDowall insists that is still the target, regardless of the problems facing the Glasgow giants. Asked if he believes promotion is still achievable, the interim boss said: 'Absolutely. That's the way you have to be here. We are expected to win games, to win leagues, to win cups - nothing changes in that aspect. 'The players know that and know what they have to do, so we carry on regardless. 'I'm not looking above us to Hearts or over my shoulder to Hibs. All I'm looking at is Dumbarton on Saturday. It's one game at a time, I've said that all along.' McDowell's first game in charge saw the Ibrox club thrashed 4-0 at Hibernian on December 27 . McDowall will boss the team at Ibrox for the first time on Saturday when Dumbarton visit and the 51-year-old hopes to get 2015 off to a better start than the previous year ended with a winning display. 'First of all we have got to get back working hard,' he said. 'We appreciate it was a poor performance against Hibs. The lads were disappointed with themselves. 'We sat through the video and looked at the game. Everyone took their share of the blame. We have to do better. It's as simple as that. But we just don't become a bad team over night. 'We just need to get back to winning ways come Saturday. 'It's always great to play at Ibrox, so that will be a good thing. But it will be a tough game against Dumbarton. We will have to be patient and make sure we get a result.' The 51-year-old (left) will be hoping for a response from his side in Saturday's home clash against Dumbarton .","Rangers were thrashed 4-0 at Hibernian on December 27 at Easter Road .

"Paul Lambert has warned Aston Villa against another FA Cup upset as he aims to avoid more embarrassment against lower-league opposition. Villa host Sky Bet Championship strugglers Blackpool in the third round on Sunday. The visitors are bottom of the Championship, but Villa can take nothing for granted having lost to Sky Bet League One side Leyton Orient in the Capital One Cup this season, as well as being dumped out of the FA Cup by Sheffield United last term. Villa have won just twice in their last 16 Barclays Premier League games and just twice at home this season. Paul Lambert has warned his Aston Villa side against another FA Cup upset against lower-league opposition . Lambert's side take on Lee Clark's (left) Championship strugglers Blackpool in the third round on Sunday . Lambert said: 'We have to be wary, they have nothing to lose. They will come out and give it a go and they won't sit in. It's a cup game and will be a breather from the league where they are having a difficult time. It's a tough game. You would think they would come and give it a game. 'I've spoken to Lee (Clark, Blackpool boss) a few times and know Alan Thompson who was a good friend at Celtic. We have to make sure we get through it.' Villa are the lowest scorers in the top four divisions with just 11 goals in 20 league matches while Blackpool have netted just 18 times. Villa were jeered off after their stalemate with Cyrstal Palace on New Year's Day, a second straight home 0-0 draw, but Lambert insisted the goals will come for the team and striker Christian Benteke. 'Christian needs to keep going, in the last four or five games he has always had a chance and it will come,' he said. 'If he keeps persevering it will come. Lambert insists goals will come for Christian Benteke who has found the net just twice so far this season . Villa sit 12th in the Premier League but were jeered off after their goalless draw with Crystal Palace on Thurday . 'We're playing out through the back and just need to take the chance. If we won 1-0 everyone would have thought Thursday would have been the perfect game. The stats show we are creating more and we just have to finish it off. 'We've only lost two games in 10 and our defensive record is really strong. There's loads of things which are progressing but when they get the chance we have to take it.' Lambert is set to make changes against the Tangerines with young midfielder Jack Grealish expected to start. 'There's a chance Jack could start Sunday,' Lambert said. 'Thursday was a bit more difficult for him than what it was against Sunderland. It was a different type of game, so we'll see.'","Paul Lambert warned his side about a shock defeat to Blackpool .

"Memphis prevailed in a triple-overtime classic at San Antonio on Wednesday, blowing a 23-point lead before recovering to eke out a 117-116 victory over the NBA champions, a day after ending Golden State's 16-game winning streak. The Grizzlies moved within half a game of the Warriors for the overall league lead and moved 4-1/2 games ahead of the Spurs, a Southwest Division rival. Elsewhere, Portland pulled away late to defeat Milwaukee, Atlanta cruised to a big win at Cleveland to extend its strong form run, and Toronto opened a nine-game lead in the Atlantic Division by beating nearest rival Brooklyn. Memphis' Marc Gasol scored 26 points, including a banked-in 3-pointer as regulation expired, while Zach Randolph had 21 points and 21 rebounds in the Grizzlies' sixth straight victory. The Memphis Grizzlies beat the San Antonio Spurs in triple overtime having blown a 23-point lead . Danny Green scored 25 points, and Tim Duncan had 23 points and 16 rebounds for San Antonio.

Portland pulled away in the fourth quarter to down Milwaukee 104-97, with both teams reeling from injuries. LaMarcus Aldridge had 23 points and 15 rebounds while Damian Lillard added 29 points and seven assists for the Blazers, who lost starting center Robin Lopez to a broken hand on Monday.

"Raymond van Barneveld has his sights set on winning a sixth world title – because he feels he has discovered a cure for his deteriorating eyesight. For many darts players, who sometimes compete around the country on poorly-lit stages, ever-decreasing vision is what usually curtails a career. Senior pros like 16-time world champion Phil Taylor, John Part and Gary Anderson have complained in recent years that as they have got older their ability to focus on the dartboard has gradually got worse. Raymond van Barneveld is ready to fight for his World Darts Championship title this year at Alexandra Palace . Like them, Barneveld was concerned at the start of this year about properly being able to see the doubles and trebles. But last month, after a quick YouTube search, the Dutch ace chanced upon the 'Bates Method', an alternative therapy aimed at improving quality of vision. After a few weeks of intense 'palm therapy' he says his eyes have improved so impressively that he has cancelled his laser surgery appointment in the New Year. And, as a result, he is confident his healing hands will be holding aloft the Sid Waddell Trophy on January 4. Van Barneveld produced a strong showing against Rowby-John Rodriguez on Monday in the first round . Barneveld, whose last world title was in 2007, said: 'Darts players often struggle with their eyes because of the light and the stress of playing every single week. 'I noticed that my eyes were getting bad because of my diabetes but I don't like playing with glasses. 'So, I went on YouTube the other day and found something about ""palming"". Basically you rub the palms of your hand together until they get extremely warm. The Dutch six-time world champion has found a method that helps him to improve his eyesight . Van Barneveld had been struggling with his eyesight and was going to have laser surgery in the new year . 'Then you place your palms on your eyes to warm them up. If you sit like this for ten minutes, you'll have better vision. I'm doing it twice a day – morning and night. 'I had known about this for two years but I was too lazy to do it. I do it ten minutes in the morning or before I go to sleep. And my vision is fine now. 'Trust me I already had an appointment on January 16 to laser my eyes because these are my working tool, they have to be right. You can't have blurred vision. But I have now cancelled my appointment because I am fine.' Barneveld, who smashed debutant Rowby-John Rodriguez in the first round with a 125.25 average in the third set, faces Jamie Caven in the second round on Monday evening. He added: 'If I believe in myself, if I play like I did in the first round, then anything is possible.'","Raymond van Barneveld is chasing a sixth World Darts Championship .

"While the majority of the country ate Christmas dinner and drank far too much on Christmas Day, Keegan Brown was hard at work between 8am and 4pm. The 22-year-old was sifting through thousands of bottles for the NHS Foundation Trust he works for on the Isle of Wight — a complete contrast from a week ago when he spectacularly knocked out the three-time world champion John Part on the opening night of the William Hill PDC World Darts Championship. ‘I’m a lab assistant,’ explained Brown. ‘And every single specimen that is produced on the island has to go between me and 12 people first.

It makes you hungrier to knock the work on the side and become more of a professional.’ And after knocking out Part last week Brown will give two-time world champion Adrian Lewis a formidable challenge on Sunday night.

"A host of footballers, coaches, managers and officials have joined forces for a poetic tribute to the 1914 Christmas Truce. Manchester City skipper Vincent Kompany, Gary Neville and Sir Trevor Brooking are just some of the names who recited lines for a video that will appear on FootballRemembers.com on Christmas Day - commemorating 100 years since soldiers on both sides of No Man's Land are said to have taken a festive respite from the horrors of the First World War by playing football. QPR striker Charlie Austin and former England boss Steve McClaren also deliver parts of the poem, which was composed by Ian McMillan and was inspired by the thoughts of the 320 young footballers who represented all 20 Premier League clubs at the Christmas Truce Tournament in Ypres, Belgium, last month.

"Crystal Palace have made a £2.5million offer for Lille left-back Pape Souare. Manager Neil Warnock has made the move as the 23-year-old Senegal international falls into Palace's budget, although Lille want £3m. Palace have asked about Neil Taylor at Swansea, Morocco left-back Achraf Lazaar of Palermo and discussed an ambitious move for Roma's Ashley Cole but have settled on Souare as he will snub joining up with Senegal for the Africa Cup of Nations.

"Chelsea will head into Christmas top of the league for the fourth time since the Premier League began in 1992. Goals from John Terry and Cesc Fabregas were enough to secure  a win at Stoke on Monday night as they restored their three-point gap over title rivals Manchester City. As a result Jose Mourinho is now top of the tree at Christmas for the eighth time during his managerial career - and seven of those times he went on to win the league. Chelsea will be hoping they can repeat history for a third time after going on to win the Premier League twice previously under Jose Mourinho when they have been top at Christmas .

Two of these came early on during Mourinho's first spell at Stamford Bridge, as they won back-to-back titles in 2005 and 2006. The Blues were also top of the pile come December 25 in the 2009-10 campaign, going on to lift the Premier League under the guidance of now Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti. Speaking after his side's 2-0 win against Mark Hughes' men, the Chelsea boss rejected talk that the past will play a part in his team's title bid this season. Mourinho told Sky Sports: 'I don't think it's important what you did in past. It is this season though. 'In my opinion we were the best today because we're top. We start this period with the hardest set of fixtures - three away and at home to West Ham - who are playing well.' Blackburn strike partners Alan Shearer and Chris Sutton celebrate Blackburn's title success in May 1995 . Manchester United players celebrate title triumph in the 2012-2013 season - the last under Sir Alex Ferguson . In the 22 Premier League seasons before now, the team that has been top of the table come Christmas Day has only gone on to win the league on 10 occasions. However, seven of those have occurred in the last decade - which will give Blues fans renewed hope that history can be repeated. Most recently Liverpool were flying high two points clear at the top this time last year, but went on to fall at the final hurdle towards the end of the season. One side which suffered a big slide down the table after being top of the pile at Christmas were Aston Villa - as they ended up finishing sixth at the end of the 1998-99 season - which included a run of just two wins in 15 league games. But with just one defeat in the Premier League so far this season, the current Chelsea side are extremely unlikely to suffer similar fate, as they look for their first Premier League crown in five years. Aston Villa ended up finishing sixth in the 1998-1999 Premier League season - despite being top at Christmas .

"Sportsmail's takes a look at the Premier League's forgotten men, who have yet to or hardly feature for their respective top-flight clubs so far this season. Andrew Magee highlights the top five from this campaign... SCOTT SINCLAIR (Manchester City) 2014-15 PL appearances: 1 . Approx wage: £45,000 a week . Sinclair played in the Community Shield and City’s 7-0 win over Sheffield Wednesday in the Capital One Cup, but as a late sub, as he was against Crystal Palace last Saturday. Since joining City in 2012, the winger has played just 18 times. Even on loan at West Brom last season he only featured in 11 games. Scott Sinclair has made just the solitary appearance for Manchester City in the Premier League so far . Sinclair comes on as a 89th minute substitute in City's most recent 3-0 win over Crystal Palace on Saturday . RIO FERDINAND (QPR) 2014-15 PL apps: 7 . Approx wage: £40,000 . Ferdinand was reunited with his old boss Harry Redknapp over the summer, but the honeymoon period did not last long. He started at the centre of the QPR defence, but after several mistakes was left out. His last appearance came in a 2-0 defeat at West Ham in October and he has had to settle for a place on the bench since. Rio Ferdinand last featured for QPR against former side West Ham at the beginning of October . Ferdinand watches on from the bench during Saturday's 3-2 win over West Brom . MATIJA NASTASIC (Manchester City) 2014-15 PL apps: 0 . Approx wage: £75,000 . The Serb was a useful player under Roberto Mancini, but has gone from Vincent Kompany’s potential partner to barely getting a look in under Manuel Pellegrini. After being told he could leave in the summer, Nastasic played in the Community Shield, but has not featured since with Pellegrini rarely mentioning his name. Matija Nastasic has failed to make any kind of impression on City boss Manuel Pellgrini . ANDERSON (Manchester United) 2014-15 PL apps: 1 . Approx wage: £60,000 . Anderson has never lived up to his billing at United and it seems Louis van Gaal feels the same way about him as David Moyes. Moyes sent him on loan to Fiorentina last season and since returning the Brazilian has played just twice — the 4-0 loss to MK Dons in the Capital One Cup and a 0-0 draw at Burnley. Anderson has been deemed surplus to requirements at Manchester United . Anderson replaces Angel di Maria to come on for his only Premier League appearance so far this season . SHAUN WRIGHT-PHILLIPS (QPR) 2014-15 PL apps: 0 . Approx wage: £70,000 . The diminutive midfielder has yet to make a Premier League appearance for QPR this season. Wright-Phillips has made the bench four times but has largely been left out of Harry Redknapp’s match-day squads. His only game time came in QPR’s 1-0 Capital One Cup defeat to Burton in August.

"Joe Hart has called upon his Manchester City team-mates to prove they have the strength of character to defend the league title for the first time in the club's history. After securing the Premier League title under Roberto Mancini in 2012, the club then relinquished the trophy far too easily to Manchester United, falling 15 points behind their neighbours by February as a mutinous dressing room became disaffected with the volatile Italian. This time around, though, Hart insists that the players are utterly determined to retain the trophy that they won with Manuel Pellegrini last season. After failing to win five of their first 11 Premier League matches of the season - drifting eight points behind Chelsea - some feared it may be another insipid title defence. Joe Hart has demanded his Manchester City team-mates can prove that they can retain the Premier League . Hart kept a clean sheet in Manchester City's 3-0 Premier League win at home to Crystal Palace on Saturday . City have since rediscovered their mojo in spectacular fashion, winning their last six Premier League matches and moving to within a hair's breadth of Chelsea. 'I take my hat off to anyone who has retained a title because it’s difficult,' the England goalkeeper said, 'We failed last time and we don’t want to do it again. We’re all aware of what happened last time. 'I think we’ve turned it around in the right situations. We’ve won ugly. Leicester last week, after a really really tough one in Rome, to go to Leicester and battle out a 1-0 was just as big as beating Roma. It was the same against Palace. Hart rushes out ot make a block but Frazier Campbell shots wide with an acrobatic effort . 'Chelsea are a strong team but I think they appreciate and totally expect us to push them. I don’t think it’s any surprise we’re on their tails.' 'Winning the thing in the first place is really hard, you’ve got to be consistent, you’ve got to get through bad patches and you have to bounce back. We have to prove we’ve got everything we need.' Hart is certainly proving his credentials, marshalling City's defence to four consecutive Premier League clean sheets. After signing a new 5-year deal with the club last week, the uncertainty of last season - when he was dropped by Manuel Pellegrini - seems a lifetime ago and he also accepts he has been pushed on by the signing of Willy Caballero. The England goalkeeper saves from the head of Mile Jedinak during the win against Crystal Palace . 'I'm really lucky that there have been good times and bad and that spell pushed me on, gave me a re-set mode. Now I'm feeling good about what I'm doing and I'm working hard, trying to improve all the time.' 'I feel in a good place,' Hart said, 'I feel I’m in a place where I should be and it’s a level I want to keep. We’re all aware that last season didn’t go according to plan for a tiny bit of the season but that makes me a better goalkeeper. I’m coming to a good age now and really enjoying being here.'","Manchester City are three points adrift of Chelsea in the Premier League .

"Paul Lambert will speak with referees’ chief Mike Riley after Gabriel Agbonlahor became the third Aston Villa player to receive a straight red card in seven weeks. Villa will appeal against Lee Mason’s decision to send off Agbonlahor for using excessive force in what seemed to be a 50-50 challenge with Ashley Young. He appears to have a strong case. Lambert said Young had admitted to Villa goalkeeper Brad Guzan that he had actually fouled Agbonlahor, rather than the other way round. Gabriel Agbonlahor was dismissed in the second half against Manchester United for a foul on Ashley Young . Aston Villa boss Pau Lambert has said he is going to appeal the red card given to striker Agbonlahor . The Aston Villa forward takes the long walk from the pitch after being dismissed with the game drawn at 1-1 . Christian Benteke was sent off for raising his hands at Tottenham’s Ryan Mason in November and Kieran Richardson was dismissed last week for a dangerous tackle on West Brom midfielder Stephane Sessegnon. Lee Mason is the most decisive referee in the select group with straight red cards, but sometimes he sees ones which are not there. When Gabriel Agbonlahor went into a strong challenge with Ashley Young it was hard to see who made the foul. Both were committed and the Villa man’s momentum meant he caught Young on the follow-through. Mason would not have been influenced by United’s players surrounding him and he had already decided. I hope the card is rescinded on appeal. FULL REVIEW HERE. Lambert is concerned Villa could be getting a bad reputation. ‘We shouldn’t. It’s not right,’ he said. ‘I probably will have a call (to Riley). I’ll find out exactly what is going on. The Kieran Richardson one I don’t have a problem. The one against United I certainly have a problem. ‘The two of them went for a fair challenge. When their lad says he fouled Gabby, that’s where it falls down. ‘You have a fourth official and a linesman. In that moment, that magnitude of a game, you’ve got to be 100 per cent right.’ Lambert confirmed that Villa would be appealing against the 65th-minute dismissal.

"Angel di Maria finally became a Manchester United player for a British record £59.7million on Tuesday night and immediately claimed he would not have left Real Madrid for any other club. The Argentinean winger signed a five-year contract at Old Trafford that will net him £6.5m a year after tax. That will put the 26-year-old just behind United captain Wayne Rooney in terms of earnings and takes the club’s investment in the player to beyond the £100m mark. Di Maria’s suggestion that he would only have left Spain for United will raise eyebrows across town at Manchester City. The defending Barclays Premier League champions were offered the player on exactly the same terms last week. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Angel di Maria's career highlights . Got him!

Di Maria was not signed in time to travel to Milton Keynes for Tuesday night's Capital One Cup tie but is expected to make his debut at Burnley in the Barclays Premier League on Saturday. United manager Van Gaal said: 'Angel is a world-class midfielder but most importantly he is a team player. There is no doubting his immense natural talent. 'He is a tremendously fast and incisive left-footed player who puts fear into the most accomplished defence. 'His dribbling skills and his ability to take on and beat opponents are a joy to watch. He is an excellent addition to the team.' United first looked at Di Maria three years ago when he was a young player at Benfica. Manchester City and Chelsea were also interested at the time. Creative: The winger should bring a new spark to Van Gaal's side, which has been lacking this season . The Manchester United megastore at Old Trafford ran out of the letter 'R' as supporters clambered to buy Angel Di Maria shirts. A sign was put outside the shop on Monday night informing fans that there were no 'R' letters left in black print. CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL STORY . Now, the Champions League winner is one of the most accomplished wide players in the game and it remains to be seen where Van Gaal tries to fit him into his much-discussed 3-4-1-2 system. Van Gaal and United chief executive Ed Woodward will now turn their attention to recently increased interest in Juventus midfielder Arturo Vidal. United have denied interest in the Chilean all summer but have belatedly got involved in serious discussions, as they have with Ajax over utility player Daley Blind. Van Gaal’s chief reservation about buying Vidal – who carries a £30m price tag – is his injury record. Knee surgery last season prevented him playing for his club since the end of March and his performances at the World Cup were modest.

"Radamel Falcao will continue to score goals for Manchester United if he is given a run in Louis van Gaal's starting XI, according to his team-mate Michael Carrick. The Colmbian, who has made just nine Premier League appearances since moving to Old Trafford on loan last summer, netted only his second goal against Aston Villa on Saturday. But Carrick believes the former Atletico Madrid striker has what it takes to cement a place in United's starting XI after returning to full fitness. Radamel Falcao rises to head Manchester United's equaliser in their 1-1 draw with Aston Villa . On-loan striker Falcao celebrates his goal in front of the travelling supporters at Villa Park on Saturday . Speaking after his side's 1-1 draw at Villa Park, Carrick told MUTV: 'He's scored so many goals over the years and you always feel that when he gets that chance he will score. He's scored a terrific header again today [Saturday] and I'm pleased for him.' 'After being out for a bit that's him back and hopefully he can go on a bit of a streak for us and we, as a team, can return to winning ways and get on a roll again.' United had won six Premier League games in succession before their draw with Paul Lambert's side but now sit seven points adrift of Manchester City and Chelsea.

"Manuel Pellegrini believes Manchester City have the firepower to propel themselves to the top of the Premier League – despite having no fit strikers available. The champions can move into pole position on Saturday if they beat Crystal Palace by a four-goal margin. But they must do so without Sergio Aguero and Edin Dzeko, who are out until the new year, and Stevan Jovetic, who will not be fit until Boxing Day at the earliest.

James Milner could be used as a false No 9, while Samir Nasri, David Silva and 18-year-old Jose Angel Pozo are also contenders for the role. Pellegrini says he has faith in his squad to cope. ‘None of them are fit so we have to arrange without Jovetic, without Dzeko, without Kun (Aguero),’ the Chilean said. ‘We will try to play in another way. I hope that midfielders will arrive from the second line and we will score in another way. ‘We will have to change our way to play, a different system because when you don’t have strikers you must arrive at the goal in a different way. ‘I hope we will do it. I know that we play against a team that defend very well so we will see what is the best solution to play without them.’ Pellegrini says contract negotiations with Joe Hart and Milner are progressing, despite no announcement being made.

"Newcastle fans and Alan Pardew could be forgiven for wishing Gus Poyet to be prised away from Sunderland and land a job abroad. For the Uruguayan has long since been the nemesis of the Magpies and their manager.

I did not prepare differently, I was just lucky enough to be in positions to score and make the difference. ‘The first time I was man-marked in England was against Newcastle at St James' Park when Bobby Robson was the manager, and I was with Tottenham. It felt strange, because I didn't think I was a player to be man-marked! ‘But, because I always scored against them, they decided to do it – but I scored anyway. So something was happening for some reason. ‘Every time I went into the box I found the ball was there, every time I made a run the ball was there. ‘Then, of course, it was probably influenced by the semi-final when I scored two goals at Wembley.’ Poyet enjoyed two FA Cup victories over Newcastle and Pardew as manager of Brighton, and he adds: ‘They were special games. It is funny because when you are the Championship side you are just trying to beat the top team – it was the same against Sunderland, because we beat them in the cup, too.

"Lee Cattermole was 17 years old when he was sat in a hotel on Newcastle's Quayside and Middlesbrough manager Steve McClaren told him he would be making his debut later that day at St James' Park. The fearless teen duly started, helped Boro to a 2-2 draw and walked away with man-of-the-match honours having been in opposition to the likes of Alan Shearer. Fast forward nine years and Cattermole is still to win on Tyneside. He was part of the Sunderland side smashed 5-1 and was sent off on his last appearance there, dismissed for dissent after the full-time whistle of a 1-1 draw. Lee Cattermole (left)  playing on his career debut for Middlesbrough against Newcastle in January 2006 . Cattermole now plays for Sunderland and was voted North-East footballer of the year for 2014 . Consolation can be taken from successive 3-0 victories for Sunderland, but Cattermole was in the stands rather than on the pitch. Today, the North-East Footballer of the Year has the chance to make his own mark. 'With making my debut there it's a special ground for me and I've got good memories of there, barring the 5-1,' he said. 'I think it's a good ground, good atmosphere, it's a place I look forward to going to. 'Before the 5-1 we were flying at the time and we went into it doing really well. We were confident that year but a lot of the team hadn't played in the derby and a lot underperformed on the day. 'We've got a lot of lads still here from that day and we've been happier in recent years. We've had the upper hand since then.' Remedy after that drubbing in 2010 was sought at the bottom of a pint glass, on the instruction of manager Steve Bruce. Cattermole recalled: 'Brucey got us in the next day and to be fair to the manager he said, 'Clear the decks. Take tomorrow off and get out and do whatever you want as a team. Get out and try and switch off'. 'We got together as a group, we went out and had a chat and a few beers and the next week we responded well and got on a good run. The manager handled it well.' Jack Colback will be playing for Newcastle on Sunday, but used to play alongside Cattermole at Sunderland . Cattermole and Co will be hoping they're enjoying a celebratory tipple this time around. The Black Cats would make their own piece of derby history with a fourth straight win over the Magpies. Newcastle's Jack Colback was part of the Sunderland team which won 3-0 last season and scored the final goal at the Gallowgate End. He and Cattermole were partners in midfield as Gus Poyet's side pulled off last year's Great Escape before his defection to St James'. Cattermole admits his former team-mate has been a miss. 'Jack's a good friend and good player. We've missed him,' he said. 'That's been a bit of a loss for us. He made a decision to move on and good luck to him. 'I think if he'd gone to any other club he would have got a good reception because he did well for Sunderland. Gus Poyet's side could win their fourth derby in a row against Newcastle on Sunday . 'Obviously, where he's chosen to go to, it's going to be difficult for the fans to take.' Colback, though, has not dominated conversation in the red-and-white dressing-room. 'We're maybe talking more about the chance to win our fourth derby on the trot, which would be massive,' said Cattermole. 'It's a good feeling going there. There's a bit of a rough reception and that's nice. It's different, it's a big game and, as a group of players, you have to embrace it and just enjoy it.' Cattermole would certainly enjoy his first taste of victory at the ground where his career began.","Lee Cattermole made his professional debut aged 17 against Newcastle .

PAOK, Heerenveen and Groningen are all interested in signing the talented Slovakian in January and have contacted City about potential moves. Rusnak is set to bid a fond farewell to the Etihad Stadium on a permanent basis next month. Albert Rusnak (on loan at SC Cambuur) is at the centre of a three-way transfer battle ahead of next month . The Slovakian is highly thought of but Manchester City's big spending meant he couldn't break into the team . The 20-year-old is currently on loan with Dutch club SC Cambuur, where he has impressed scoring four goals in 16 appearances, which has led to him being described as the 'Pearl of the Eredivisie' by Dutch press. And his displays have caught the attention of a number of clubs across Europe. Having joined City as a 16-year-old, Rusnak has strong emotional ties with the Etihad Stadium club. But the attacking midfielder wants to continue his football education elsewhere. His current loan deal expires on January 1, but City are open to allowing the youngster to leave on a permanent deal in January. Rusnak is highly-rated by City coaches following his arrival from FC Kosice as a teenage prodigy. But the club's big spending era ultimately meant the talented Slovakian could not break into the senior set-up. And Rusnak is optimistic a permanent switch away next month can catapult him into the senior Slovakia set-up.","Manchester City's Albert Rusnak set to leave the club next month .

The gesture was greeted with a smile by Mr Fink who took the time to show Robson his season tickets throughout the years. When asked by Robson what his best memory at Old Trafford has been during his 69 years as a season ticket holder, Mr Fink was quick to pinpoint one 1957 European Cup game during Sir Matt Busby's reign as manager - a 3-0 quarter-final second leg win against Athletic Bilbao. Played at local rivals Manchester City's Maine Road; goals from Johnny Berry, Tommy Taylor and Dennis Viollet saw United win 6-5 on aggregate. 'The biggest game and the most sensational was when we played Bilbao in the European Cup,' Mr Fink reflected. We need to win 3-0 because we had lost the first leg [5-3] and we turned it around.

"Stoke manager Mark Hughes feels Chelsea are no worse offenders than any other side when it comes to diving. A number of incidents from last weekend's Barclays Premier League fixtures brought the topic of simulation back to the fore once again. And three of those involved Chelsea players going to ground in their 2-0 home win over Hull, with Willian and Diego Costa being booked for diving either side of Gary Cahill apparently throwing himself to the turf but going unpunished. Chelsea centre back Gary Cahill (centre) was not booked for this dive against Hull last Saturday . Steve Bruce  was furious that Cahill was not punished for an apparent dive against his side last weekend . Tigers boss Steve Bruce described the Cahill incident as being 'like something out of Swan Lake'. But when Hughes, whose 12th-placed team are table-topping Chelsea's next league opponents, was asked ahead of that meeting if he thought the Blues were particularly guilty of diving, he said: 'No - they are no worse than anyone else in my view.' Speaking at his press conference ahead of Monday's clash at the Britannia Stadium, ex-Chelsea striker Hughes admitted referees currently have a tough task on their hands trying to distinguish between incidents where a 'soft' foul has been committed and where there has been no contact, with a player going down deliberately. At the same time, though, the Welshman - who in October defended Victor Moses, the winger on loan at Stoke from Chelsea, amid accusations he dived in a victory over Swansea - does not regard simulation as 'a problem right through the game'. Hughes said of the diving debate sparked by last weekend's incidents: 'There is a focus almost every week, and more often than not it changes from one week to the next. Stoke manager Mark Hughes says Chelsea are no worse offenders of diving than any other side ahead . 'An incident in a game will be highlighted and people will surmise there is a problem right through the game, but I don't think that is the case. 'I think there will always be players maybe anticipating tackles coming in, and when a defender doesn't, then that can lead to embarrassing situations for the people involved because it looks like they are trying to gain an advantage. 'It is important that if somebody is fouled, the right decision is made, even if it is a soft foul - a correct decision is a foul, or a penalty. That is not simulation in my view. 'So it is about getting the right decisions from referees, although it is not easy for them to deal with. 'I think more and more these days there is more skill in it, with players prepared to go down to gain an advantage even when there has been absolutely no contact whatsoever - that is incorrect, and should not happen. 'There is a grey area in terms of players having contact and players just going down without any, so that is what needs stamping out.' Glenn Whelan (right) with Potters boss Hughes says he wants to stay at the club for the rest of his career . Meanwhile, Potters midfielder Glenn Whelan has indicated he wants to stay with Stoke for the rest of his career. Whelan, with the club since 2008, is out of contract next summer and Hughes said on Thursday that an offer of a new deal has been made to the Republic of Ireland international which he is yet to respond to. Quoted by The Sentinel on Friday, Whelan, who last started a Stoke game in early October, said: 'I will be just keeping my head down and working as hard as I can to get back in the team, and see where it takes me. 'That has done all right for me since I've been at Stoke so I'm sure I'll be okay come the end of the season. 'I would definitely like to stay. I have always enjoyed coming in for training and pulling on the red and white jersey. That's no different now. 'It's difficult because I'm not in the team at the moment. I haven't actually sat down with the manager or anyone on the board, so where the stories have come from of late I'm not sure. They haven't come from me. 'If we can get something sorted out, it's not me wanting to leave. For as long as I still have a chance of playing I'll be doing all I can to spend the rest of my career here.'","Diving has again been a topic of debate in the Premier League recently .

But with the atmosphere and the type of performance we can get at home, we know if we're still in the tie when we get back to Bramall Lane then there will be a game on.

It's great to have a run in the cup - great for supporters and for the revenue of the club.' QPR, meanwhile, have won only two cup ties in the last 11 years, with several of their early exits coming at the hands of lower-division opposition. Rangers boss Harry Redknapp, who made seven changes but still fielded an experienced side, admitted: 'They looked sharper than us all over the pitch. 'They were brighter and better than us and looked like a team that had 10 days without playing a game - we were playing our fourth and looked lethargic. We looked sluggish today. 'They thoroughly deserved their win. They played well and you've got to give them the credit. 'Look at their record - they got to the semi-finals last year and this year are in the semi-finals of the Capital One Cup. 'It's no good shouting and screaming. What can you do?

"When it came down to choosing one of the best names in football, Max Power’s parents had two choices. Their son was to be named either after his mother or the family’s pet labrador. ‘Thankfully, the labrador won,’ says Power. ‘My mum’s name is Maxine, so I’m glad I didn’t get that.’ There is more to the Tranmere Rovers midfielder than just his name but it has certainly helped to get him noticed. Tranmere midfielder Max Power is looking forward to playing against Swansea City in the FA Cup . Power is being tracked by the likes of Swansea, Celtic, Rangers, Burnley and Derby . ‘The worst was thinking that I’d been named after Homer’s alter ego character in The Simpsons,’ he says, ‘but when I looked it up I was relieved to see that episode didn’t come out until I was six. ‘I got asked to do a piece for the Max Power car magazine once, although I did keep my clothes on for the pictures,’ he jokes. ‘..and I get a double-take from lads when I introduce myself from time to time but I’ve got used to it. I’ve even called my baby son Max Jr.’ Fortunately, Power has a football talent that is also attracting attention. The 21-year-old is expected to become the latest product of Tranmere’s academy to step up into the big time with even this weekend’s FA Cup opponents Swansea City among his admirers. Celtic, Rangers, Burnley and Derby have also charted his progress this season; one that has brought nine goals amid Tranmere’s struggle to escape the clutches of a second successive relegation, this time from League Two. As a local boy, it has been a difficult fall for Power to endure. ‘Getting relegated last season was the worst experience of my career,’ says Power. ‘We needed to beat Bradford to have a chance but we had a man sent off and the game fell away from us. I was taken off and I remember the Bradford fans singing ‘’Going down, going down’’ as other results filtered through. I was crying on the bench. ‘I was sick for weeks afterwards, embarrassed to go out. It was very hard to take. ‘My dad and a lot of my friends are big Tranmere fans and they tried to lift me but the only time you get it out of your system is when you get back playing again.’ Power sat down with Sportsmail's Simon Jones to discuss his side's upcoming encounter . The 21-year-old rejected the chance to join Liverpool's academy at the tender age of eight . The plan was to bounce back quickly but new manager Rob Edwards was sacked after just two wins in 14 games and, with Tranmere staring the Conference in the face, Micky Adams was brought in to start the salvage operation. ‘I think I’ve had six managers since I turned professional,’ says Power. ‘John Barnes, Les Parry, who gave me my debut, Ronnie Moore, John McMahon as caretaker, Rob and now the boss. Each of them are different characters. Micky Adams came with a reputation for being strict and he is but it works for me. He’s helped me a lot and I’m playing with confidence now. Every time I go on the pitch I believe I’m going to score.’ Power has scored two goals already in this season’s FA Cup, scoring the winner in the first round against Bristol Rovers and deciding the second round replay against Oxford United. He is quick to point out his first ever Tranmere goal was also in the FA Cup against Braintree. It seems ominous for Swansea. ‘I hope so,’ says Power. ‘I’ve always had an affection for the FA Cup. My earliest memory was watching Liverpool beat Tranmere 4-2 at Prenton Park in 2001 with my mum, who’s a big Liverpool fan, and I saw ""the Gerrard Final"" when Steven was out on his feet but inspired Liverpool to beat West Ham at Cardiff. It’s always exciting, it’s a great competition especially for clubs in our position. ‘We’re under no illusions it will be a tough game. There are Premier League sides that struggle to get the ball off Swansea so we’ll do well to get a result but history shows anything is possible.’ Power has played under six managers since turning professional - including John Barnes (pictured) Power watched Steven Gerrard inspire Liverpool to victory in the 2006 FA Cup final in Cardiff . An eye-catching performance could help propel Power to the level he is destined for. Educated at Wirral Grammar School, where former Prime Minister Harold Wilson attended, Power is ambitious but remains grounded. You would expect little else from a young man who turned down the chance to join Liverpool at the age of eight to stay with Tranmere. ‘Like everyone I’d like to play at the best level but Tranmere have always looked after me,’ he says. ‘Steve Heighway gave me the chance to stay with Liverpool when I was young but I enjoyed myself more at Tranmere. I’ve never regretted it. ‘You see players who stay with big clubs chasing a dream but the reality is it is often better to step back or sideways to sustain a career. ‘Playing at this level is hard but it’s a great experience.

"Peering over the wall at the bottom of his garden, John Marsden received an education in the art of being a striker that money cannot buy. When Southport head to Derby County, aiming to strike another blow for non-League sides in the FA Cup, Marsden will think back to the days when he studied Robbie Fowler and Michael Owen, and later Fernando Torres and Luis Suarez. Marsden’s family home in West Derby backs on to Liverpool’s training ground but of the current forwards he monitors, it is Rickie Lambert who is a continued source of inspiration for a young man who holds a record for scoring hat-tricks for Liverpool schoolboys that even Fowler cannot match. VIDEO Scroll down to see one of Marsden's ex-Liverpool heroes score in training . Southport striker John Marsden has revealed he used to peer over the wall at the bottom of his garden . Marsden's family home backs on to Liverpool's Melwood training ground . Michael Owen and Robbie Fowler were among the players Marsden used to study . This has been a season illuminated by strikers such as Charlie Austin and Jamie Vardy, who have battled their way from the lower leagues to thrive in the top flight. Lambert’s route was similarly unconventional. Marsden is a ‘mad Liverpudlian’ and his dream in this season’s FA Cup is to get through today’s challenge before locking horns at Anfield against his boyhood heroes. ‘We have got a shed at the back of the house, so I used to climb on top of it and watch them train,’ says the 22-year-old. ‘Me and my sister, Charlotte, would get autographs most days and speak to the players. Robbie was my hero and I’ve still got his shirt on my wall.’ Had Marsden’s career gone as he envisaged, he would be playing for Celtic. He was scouted by the late Tommy Burns as a schoolboy and his logic was that going to Scotland would increase his chances of playing in the Champions League. Marsden also used to watch former Liverpool strikers Fernando Torres and Luis Suarez from his garden . But a broken foot, sustained in a freak schoolyard accident, damaged his ambitions and after leaving Celtic, he had spells with Rochdale, non-League side Stockport Sports, Stoke’s Under 21s and Shrewsbury before ending up with Southport. ‘I was in school and slipped on the wet floor and cracked my bone right through, just coming down a couple of steps,’ he says. ‘I played for Celtic’s reserves, trained with the first team but never got to the level I wanted. It was devastating but that happens in football, doesn’t it?’ Fairytales, however, also happen and Marsden added: ‘I think people like seeing non-League clubs have a bit of a run. ‘We all watched Warrington beat Exeter and we were buzzing. Then you see Blyth and that’s a great story. We’d love one of our own.’","John Marsden's family home backs on to Liverpool's training ground .

"Goals from David Goodwillie and substitute Cammy Smith took Aberdeen to the top of the Premiership table on Thursday night — now the real challenge is for Derek McInnes’ men to stay there for as long as possible. They certainly have the opportunity to remain at the league summit for a lot longer than seemed apparent just hours before the kick-off at Pittodrie on Thursday. As Celtic’s early evening meeting with Partick Thistle fell foul of the stormy weather in Glasgow, a northern ray of light emerged for the Dons to safeguard their lead over Ronny Deila’s side. Aberdeen star Cammy Smith celebrates his late goal against St Johnstone at Pittodrie . On this form, there is no reason why Aberdeen cannot maintain what many will consider an unlikely challenge to the defending champions as they simply dominated St Johnstone virtually from start to finish yesterday. It is now eight league wins in their past nine games and six victories in a row without even conceding a goal, their best run in 23 years and surely the sort of form a credible threat is built on. This is now the latest stage of any season that Aberdeen have been top of the table since May 1991, when Alex Smith’s side led Rangers going into a fateful final day. A draw at Ibrox would have been enough to bring the league trophy back to Pittodrie but they suffered a crushing 2-0 defeat and the rest is history. How McInnes and the current generation of the club’s supporters would love to take it all the way to the last day of this campaign. However, even then, you get the feeling that the Dons manager would still be carefully claiming that the title was Celtic’s to lose, given his naturally pragmatic approach to the situation. Smith wraps up the three points for the home side with a late goal in Aberdeen . In the build-up to this match, McInnes tried his best to dampen any excitement over Aberdeen’s prospects of mounting a serious title challenge this season. The news filtering through from Glasgow that Celtic’s players would be enjoying a holiday like most other people didn’t help that quest. All of a sudden, the prospect changed from the possibility of a few hours as league leaders to one that could conceivably stretch deep into the month and beyond. Celtic’s trip to Gran Canaria in mid-January means even a win at Kilmarnock on Monday would now leave them a point behind Aberdeen, should the Pittodrie men pick up another victory at Motherwell on Sunday. The Dons players were left under even closer scrutiny yesterday in front of a large, expectant crowd, who were looking to see if they could cope with the pressure that the scenario presented. Early indications were that they emphatically could and many of the reasons why were evident as a St Johnstone side, on a similar good run of form, were more than competently dealt with. The home side played with pace, penetration and a movement that the visitors struggled to come to terms with, particularly during a blistering opening phase. The Perth club came into the game on a six-match winning streak and were undefeated in their last eight league games since losing at home to Kilmarnock in mid-October. Aberdeen's David Goodwillie (right) celebrates his opening goal with Peter Pawlett (left) Not that they were allowed to settle into any sort of attacking rhythm in front of a healthy home crowd as they were hemmed in their own half for lengthy spells during the opening 45 minutes. It had taken just six of those minutes for their highly-motivated hosts to edge in front, with a sublime piece of skill from Goodwillie required to get the better of Alan Mannus. The striker’s chest trap from Niall McGinn’s cross brought the ball under control and an extravagant overhead kick sent it soaring into the net, with the aid of a slight deflection. That was Goodwillie’s first goal since October but he should have increased that tally just a few minutes later in the aftermath of Chris Millar’s caution for pulling back Jonny Hayes. The midfielder took the resulting free-kick, picking out an unmarked Goodwillie, who guided his header wastefully wide of the target from 12 yards. For the rest of the half, Aberdeen found Mannus a frustratingly difficult barrier to their ambitions as the Northern Ireland international produced a series of impressive saves to keep the deficit down. Peter Pawlett and McGinn, in particular, had reason to curse the athleticism of a goalkeeper who somehow blocked their netbound efforts as St Johnstone struggled to repel attacks down their left flank. Brian Easton’s absence meant Dave Mackay switching to left-back, where he looked far less comfortable than usual, something which was emphasised when Millar had a go at him midway through the half. Goodwillie fires the ball past St Johnstone goalkeeper Alan Mannus and into the back of the net . Of much more concern for the visitors was the way that the Aberdeen players kept finding the space to fire attempts at their goal, where Mannus continued to excel. The best of several important saves came in 33 minutes when the elusive Hayes let fly from distance only to see the Saints goalkeeper once again make an impressive diving parry. Goodwillie did manage to beat Mannus from the edge of the area with a neat spin and shot but that also just beat the far post on its way past, while Pawlett handled before putting the ball into the net. That offence was well spotted by referee Craig Thomson as his assistant on that side was no help at all, but the fragility of a one-goal lead was made clear in the last action before the break. Wright’s side won a corner that Aberdeen did not defend with any great authority, only for home goalkeeper Scott Brown to extend his unbeaten record by blocking Steven Anderson’s overhead kick. It was a warning that clearly registered as, if anything, the Dons played with an even greater intensity at the start of the second half, with the visitors’ goal continuing to lead a charmed life. Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes applauds the fans after the victory which takes his side to the top . Quite how it took Aberdeen until stoppage time to finally confirm their victory must be the only concern for their manager, given the chances scorned. Ash Taylor, who was resolute in defence to the extent that he was given the sponsor’s man of the match award, twice headed over the bar from close range when picked out from corners. McGinn had a fresh-air swipe at the ball when any contact would have brought a goal for the hosts and Adam Rooney will not want to watch his even more embarrassing miss. Pawlett raced clear to the right touchline before putting a cross to the back post which Rooney, on the stretch, astonishingly sent soaring over the crossbar from point-blank range. It was left to substitute Smith to finally confirm the inevitable when Rooney turned provider, evading the offside trap as St Johnstone pressed for an unlikely leveller. His cross found the unmarked Smith, who was assured enough to steer his shot beyond Mannus, who was helpless for once.","David Goodwillie and Cammy Smith scored in the 2-0 victory at Pittodrie .

"Twin brothers Phil and Stephen Turnbull cannot go to bed until the other is home safely. They speak on the phone after every training session or match and credit each other for their progress in life, on and off the pitch. They are devastated that their FA Cup third-round ties fall on the same day. There is, then, respect, love and friendship. That, however, very quickly changes when Gateshead midfielder Phil – regarded as one of the best players outside of the Football League - expresses regret that they were not drawn against Stephen’s Blyth Spartans, the lowest-ranked team left in the competition. ‘I would have been buzzing if we’d got them. It would filter out another bad team then we’d have the chance of getting a big dog in the fourth round,’ Phil tells Sportsmail from the family home where they grew up in South Shields. Stephen (left) and Phil Turnbull pose with their mum Susan before the FA Cup third round this weekend . Footballing twins Stephen and Phil speak to Sportsmail's Craig Hope ahead of their FA Cup encounters . The pair (pictured graduating from Sunderland University) have been kept apart in the third round . The twins were at the same team together aged nine but have played against each other professionally . Stephen – who scored a free-kick live on TV during Blyth’s second-round victory over Hartlepool and who was caught at the centre of the storm which saw Bury expelled from the FA Cup in 2006 – bites back: ‘This clown isn’t for real. He thinks Gateshead are some sort of Premier League team. We beat Hartlepool in the league above them – we’d more than match them.’ As it is, Northern Premier League Blyth entertain Championship side Birmingham City and Conference promotion hopefuls Gateshead travel to Premier League West Brom. Mum, Susan, and sister, Kathryn, will be at Croft Park, while dad, John, and brother, Jonathan, will be at The Hawthorns. The last time the family was split in this fashion was when Blyth hosted Gateshead in the FA Trophy in 2011. It is the only time in their 27 years that the twins – who were professionals together at Hartlepool and team-mates at Sunderland’s academy - have started a match in opposition. Gateshead won 2-0 and Phil was star man. ‘It was great to play against each other – I wanted to do him and he wanted to do me,’ says Stephen. Phil corrects him: ‘Yeah, but I did do you – you didn’t do me. I absolutely ran the gaff and he was spewing.’ Stephen, reluctantly, agrees: ‘To be fair, he was man-of-the-match by a mile. I told our lads, “sit on my kid, stop him playing and we’ll win”. But one of our strikers – he was a lazy b*****d – he just let him dictate things. They had me left-midfield but if I’d played in the centre we would have won – I’d have bullied him.’ The pair had just moved out of their family home before the tie and bought their first place together. Following the draw, Stephen ran tape down one half of the house and drew up boundaries. Word spread and it soon attracted media attention. Phil recalls: ‘Someone rang us out of the blue and said, “Can you go on the radio now?”. We just thought it would be Radio Newcastle. We didn’t realise until afterwards it was national radio – we battered each other, saying we going to slap each other and all sorts. Stephen plays for Blyth Spartans while Phil is a midfielder for nearby Gateshead . The duo's sister Kathryn, pictured with her six-day-old son, will be at Croft Park to watch Stephen . The twin brothers, aged 14, will be hoping to face each other in the fourth round of the FA Cup . 4 - This is the fourth time Blyth Spartans have reached the FA Cup third round. They were knocked out in 1971-72 and 2008-09 but beat Enfield in 1977-78 before famously progressing to the fifth round. ‘Then the TV cameras came. We’d just bought the house off our nana. The carpets were horrific, the worst you’ve ever seen. ‘After we were on BBC we got a phone call from someone asking to buy the carpets. We thought it was a wind-up. Stephen spoke to them and said, “Aye, come around, you can buy them, no bother”. ‘Next thing, this couple turn up at the door over the moon that they’re getting the carpets. They owned a farm and gave us £50 and 12 eggs. Result.’ Result, too, is what they both enjoyed in the last round of the cup. Stephen curled into the top corner what Alan Shearer described as ‘the best free-kick I’ve ever seen’ during Blyth’s heroic 2-1 win at Hartlepool. Phil, who was in the away end at Victoria Park that night, then starred as Gateshead beat Warrington 2-0, also on TV. Their sister gave birth to Thomas 48 hours later and Stephen was back on BBC for the third-round draw. Stephen celebrates after Blyth Spartans knocked out Hartlepool in the second round . ‘It was just an incredible few days for the family,’ says Phil. ‘I went down to Hartlepool and got a little bit of stick off some of the fans for being a Gateshead player. I wasn’t a Blyth fan, I was a Stephen Turnbull fan. ‘When his free-kick went in I was sucking the ball into the back of the net, I went off it. I was absolutely buzzing. I looked over to my mam and dad and I could see they were bursting with pride. It was a special day for the whole family. My sister was watching at home, we thought it might send her into labour. It was just the perfect FA Cup night.’ Back in 2006, however, the FA Cup was far from perfect for Stephen. On loan at Bury from Hartlepool, he had helped them to a 2-0 victory over Chester – including a certain Roberto Martinez - to land a tie at Ipswich in the third round. Stephen looks back: ‘I had a kip after training one day, woke up in the hotel room and put BBC World News on. There it was, my picture on the telly! I thought I was having a nightmare. I just thought “what the f…”. ‘We’d been kicked out of the cup because I was ineligible, the secretaries hadn’t registered me. I was gutted. I felt guilty because people didn’t realise it wasn’t my fault.’ Phil was back at home on South Tyneside, also unaware of what had happened. ‘I saw it on the news and thought, “what the hell is going on here? Why is my twin on World news?”,’ he remembers. ‘It’s funny though, we were in the pub on a quiz machine one day and that question came up. It’s been mentioned in wedding speeches and all sorts.’ The brothers themselves are yet to marry, although Phil moved in with his girlfriend earlier this month – ‘I secretly hate his missus for taking him away,’ says Stephen. It is the first time they have not shared a house and both agree they would have been lost without each other. Phil says: ‘Being twins is so good for you. If he did something then it spurred me to do it. For example, when we were at Hartlepool after signing YTS, I kicked on a bit and got picked for England youths. I came back and he was nutting the back gate – he was going off it.’ ‘I felt like a reject,’ says Stephen. ‘He got called up for England and I couldn’t get in the youth team. Two months later I was in the first-team. That’s always been the way, one of us would do something then the other would do something better.’ Stephen celebrates after scoring in his side's 2-1 win against Hartlepool in the second round of the FA Cup . Gateshead's Phil will be hoping his side can eliminate Premier League outfit West Brom . Phil adds: ‘It was like at the end of last season when we went to Wembley in the Conference play-offs, it was amazing. ‘Then he comes in with a Top Trump and scores a free-kick in front of £2.4million people.’ Before that goal, engineer Stephen had spent six months in the boiler room of a cruise ship. ‘It was horrific – 45 degrees and proper graft,’ says the Blyth anchorman. ‘I never thought I’d be playing in the third round of the FA Cup when I was in there. But I’ll be back on the ships in 2016, this will be my last year playing football. ‘You have to think long-term, we’re not playing in the Prem. Phil’s the same and he’s doing his teacher training. We went to college when we were professionals at Hartlepool and got our degrees together. We’re switched on in that sense. You have to be at the level we’re at. There’s no excuse. ‘We’ve always made sacrifices – missing school discos, New Year’s Eve, holidays – and I suppose all of this now is a little bit of payback.’ Is there, though, another chapter to be written in the story of the Turnbull twins? Stephen insists: ‘Both of us can definitely get a result. We won’t get battered. ‘The pitch at our place isn’t great, it’ll be freezing cold and the ground will be rammed and rocking. ‘You’ve got to remember – they’ve got two arms, two legs and a head. I’ve played against players from the Prem and yeah, they’re consistently better, but we can be better than them on our day. ‘Bring it on. It’s the FA Cup. We love it.’ With this pair, you get the feeling there might just be another tale to tell come tea-time.","Phil Turnbull's Gateshead face West Brom in the third round of the FA Cup .

"John Carver was sat having a few beers in a bar in Tenerife as he watched Newcastle United beaten by League One Stevenage in the FA Cup third round four years ago – and he wasn’t best pleased. The current caretaker boss is a lifelong Newcastle fan and was just five years old when they last won a trophy – the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup – in 1969. Carver takes his United side to Leicester City on Saturday afternoon and, while the club hierarchy have previously played down the importance of the cup competitions, Alan Pardew’s former assistant says he will be naming his strongest XI to win the game. Newcastle United caretaker boss John Carver hopes the club can end their wait for a major trophy . The lifelong Magpie takes charge of United again as they take on Leicester City in the FA Cup on Saturday . ‘Four years ago, I was in Tenerife watching the game against Stevenage and let me tell you, I was really disappointed - and I had a few beers as well,’ he said. ‘Listen, there has been an awful lot made about cup runs so let me say this: Every game I go into I want to win, so I will put the best team on the pitch that I possibly can to win the game. ‘I know exactly how much it means to the fans to have a cup run because I am one of them. ‘I have been to an FA Cup final and a semi-final and I will never forget that reception. Although we lost to Manchester United in 1999, when we came out of the tunnel at Wembley, with our fans were behind us, it was quite emotional. ‘So I know exactly what it means. I have actually been in the stands when we lost to Arsenal in the final in 1998, so I know what it is like and how important it is. So to get back there is one of the most important things in my eyes.’ Newcastle will be without central defender Steven Taylor for the rest of the season after injury against Burnley . Alan Pardew (centre back) has left St James' Park to take charge at struggling Crystal Palace . Carver is bidding to win the Newcastle job on a permanent basis but was disappointed with the 3-3 draw at home to Burnley on New Year’s Day, a match in which they surrendered the lead three times. He does not, however, believe that Saturday's game takes on any added importance given their failure to beat the second-from-bottom Clarets. ‘There’s no extra significance,’ said Carver, who has lost defender Steven Taylor for the remainder of the season with an Achilles injury. ‘I know how important it is to win a Premier League game and how important it is to win an FA Cup match too, so I have not thought of it any differently if we had won, drew or lost against Burnley. ‘I need to see what we have available and I will pick my strongest available side. But if I have three or four players who are carrying things, then that is obviously an issue. The team might pick itself. ‘We have already lost Papiss Cisse to the African Cup of Nations and we are going to lose Cheick Tiote and Mehdi Abeid soon. So that's three players we have lost and with the injury list we have got, we have to deal with it.’","Newcastle are away at Leicester City in the FA Cup third round .

Liverpool's American owners have told Steven Gerrard he is welcome to return to Liverpool at any time, following the announcement of his departure at the end of the season. Gerrard made his Liverpool debut in 1998, and has made just shy of 700 appearances for the Reds to date. Prinicipal owner John W Henry and chairman Tom Werner said in a statement: 'This news stirs many strong emotions for all of us connected with the club.

'But there is also a sense of celebration and gratitude, that we've all been privileged to watch and work with one of the true greats, not just of this club, but the game in general. 'We will all have our own personal memories of breathtaking Steven Gerrard moments; there are far too many to list.' Of those memories, many will point to the 2005 Champions League final as an overriding high point in Gerrard's career.

"Birmingham boss Gary Rowett has refused to give Blyth Spartans any extra FA Cup ammunition and insisted his players are ready for battle. The Blues go to Blyth in the third round on Saturday aiming to avoid a huge upset. They are 14th in the Sky Bet Championship compared to Blyth, who sit 16th in the Northern League Premier Division. Birmingham boss Gary Rowett has acknowledged the threat posed by FA Cup opposition Blyth Spartans . Blyth were one of the stories of the second round, beating Hartlepool United to progress to the next stage . Spartans midfielder Stephen Turnbull called the tie an 'anti-climax' after their 2-1 second round win at Hartlepool but Rowett played down using it as extra inspiration. 'I don't get involved in what any other team say but we will respect Blyth and we will go there as if we are playing Derby or Nottingham Forest,' he said. 'I will give them the utmost of respect and if one or two of my players use any comments positively that's up to them. 'I won't be pinning anything up in the dressing room wall, except for one or two players if they don't perform.' But Rowett has warned Birmingham they must be mentally prepared in order to reach the fourth round. Birmingham's Clayton Donaldson (left) celebrates after scoring against Nottingham Forest on December 28 . Birmingham go into Saturday's game against Blyth in good form, having beaten Forest 3-1 last week . The St Andrew's chief has already shocked QPR when he was Burton boss in the League Cup this season but knows the in-form Blues are favourites this time. They have won six of their 10 games since Rowett's appointment in November but he has underlined the danger Blyth pose. He said: 'I spent six years at Burton where we played against some huge teams in cup competitions and I know if a team from a higher division is not mentally prepared and not expecting the hostility they come unstuck. 'Not all of our players have been Premier League and Championship players all their lives so I'm sure there will be a few who have played at this type of ground.

"In Nigel Clough’s first week as Sheffield United manager, he offered to help a wayward forward with extra shooting practice after training only to be told by the player he had an important appointment with his tattooist. Suffice to say, that player is now pursuing a career away from Bramall Lane. When it comes to laying down the football law, it’s a case of ‘like father, like son’ in the Clough family. To say Nigel is a replica of his legendary dad Brian, who won the league championship with Derby County and Nottingham Forest and two European Cups with Forest, is simplifying things slightly. Sheffield Untied manager Nigel Clough has overseen 13 victories in 16 cup ties . Brian Clough, Nigel's father, who won the league championship with Derby County and Nottingham Forest . Nigel (right) has replicated his late father Brian (left) as an outstanding football manager . Certainly, Brian would never have been accused of being disrespectful to match officials as Nigel was by Southampton manager Ronald Koeman after a stormy Capital One Cup tie on Tuesday night, when League One United won 1-0 to record their 13th victory in 16 cup ties under Clough. The clash with Tottenham in January will be their second major semi-final in two seasons. Yet there are overpowering similarities, and not just because Nigel seems to be physically morphing into his old man, so much so that brother Simon — who works as a scout for the Blades — has noticed he is subconsciously replicating some of their father’s mannerisms. Burton Albion 2001-02 . Semi-final of FA Trophy . Beat: Barrow, Blyth Spartans, Farnborough Town, Woking, Chester City. Derby County 2008-09 . Semi-final of League Cup . Beat: Lincoln City, Preston North End, Brighton, Leeds, Stoke. Sheffield United 2013-14 . Semi-final of FA Cup . Beat: Colchester, Cambridge, Aston Villa, Fulham, Nottingham Forest, Charlton. Sheffield United 2014-15 . Semi-final of League Cup . Beat: Mansfield Town, West Ham, Leyton Orient, MK Dons, Southampton. P.S. Clough-managed sides have been knocked out of cup competitions twice by Man Utd — the 2005-06 FA Cup and the 2008-09 League Cup — but managed to avoid defeat in the home match of both ties. Nigel is not only strong on discipline and team ethic, he has also inherited the knack of maximising his players’ abilities. Against Southampton, Clough gave a debut to Che Adams, who was playing non-League football with Ilkeston a few weeks ago, selected right winger Ryan Flynn at right back and started with 17-year-old Louis Reed in midfield. Brian bought striker Gary Birtles from Long Eaton for £2,000 and turned him into a European Cup winner, saved the career of Kenny Burns by shifting him from centre forward to centre half and picked 18-year-old Gary Mills for a European Cup final against Hamburg. Like Dad, Nigel believes in wingers and keeping instructions simple. One pep talk to a No 11 lasted four words: ‘Run at your man’. Club owners Kevin McCabe and Saudi Prince Abdullah bin Mosaad bin Abdulaziz Al Saud will also be relieved to see some good publicity come the club’s way after the mess they made of offering convicted rapist Ched Evans a chance to train with them. Blades midfielder Jose Baxter says Clough has raised expectations in a way you can imagine Brian doing at Derby and Forest. ‘He wants everyone bang at it. He won’t let your standards drop. He wants you to play until the last whistle is blown,’ Baxter explains. Nigel Clough is not afraid to take risks and deployed winger Ryan Flynn at right back against Southampton . Clough also started 17-year-old Louis Reed (centre) in midfield during his side's 1-0 against the Saints . Unlike Brian, 48-year-old Nigel is happier to give credit to his players and the fans for the fantastic run. Their knockout prowess makes their position of only fifth in League One all the more strange. Bramall Lane was a bearpit on Tuesday and made any club who don’t take the cups seriously look ridiculous. ‘It was a remarkable effort by the players and the supporters,’ said Clough. ‘We went for it. We try to do that in most games but haven’t quite had the breaks. ‘The 14 lads we put out there gave everything. Nights like that are very special because of the atmosphere.’ Tempers fray on the touchline as Sheffield United coach Chris Morgan is sent to the stands at Bramall Lane . Clough holds out his hands as Ronald Koeman walks off and refuses to shake hands with his counterpart . Of course, there had to be controversy, too, with a Clough involved. Koeman refused to shake hands due to what he considered a lack of respect from the Blades bench — including coach Chris Morgan, who was sent to the stands — towards fourth official Paul Tierney. Even Brian Clough would have been hard-pressed to beat Nigel’s one-liner about the snub. ‘To say I’m not too concerned is an understatement — I couldn’t care less,’ he said. Like father, like son.

"Sunderland head coach Gus Poyet is keeping his fingers crossed that the club can do the business he wants as he awaits the opening of the January transfer window. The 47-year-old Uruguayan has made no secret of the fact he is desperate to further strengthen his squad next month with goals a priority, but he knows too how difficult the winter market can be. Sporting director Lee Congerton is the man charged with the task of fulfilling Poyet's wishes, and the latter knows he will have to remain patient. Sunderland manager Gus Poyet is keen to bring in new players in the January transfer window . Fabian Delph is sent off during Sunderland's 0-0 draw with Villa - Black Cats have drawn more games than any other team in the Premier League this season (11) He said with a smile: 'Yes, we want the best player in the world very cheap, nice-looking, he can score goals, he can run, sprint. 'But it's difficult, very difficult. We are working, I can tell you we are working very hard. Are we going to bring in someone? Are we going to buy him, loan him? We will see, it depends on so many things. 'Certain kinds of players are only available on loan; certain kinds of players, you need to buy them and it costs a lot; certain players, they cost less because they are a nightmare or they have got some issues and you think you are the genius who can bring them to you and calm them down. 'If you see what happens in Spain and Italy - Fernando Torres goes one way and then Chelsea go maybe the other way, and that starts making things happen. 'We are working very hard, very hard. It's not easy, but we will see.' Sunderland need a goal scorer to supplement Steven Fletcher and Connor Wickham (right) Sunderland's three strikers, including Jozy Altidore (right) have only scored six goals between them . Poyet's main focus is not difficult to identify with his team having scored only 16 goals in their first 19 Barclays Premier League games of the season, and the fact that forwards Steven Fletcher, Connor Wickham and Jozy Altidore have contributed just six between them is an added concern. But asked about the chances of boosting his strike force, he replied: 'The easiest way to sort out a few problems in front of goal is to go and buy. 'Now the right price, the right player who scores goals coming here and doing it straight away - everybody is looking for the same, so it's a competition. There are not many, but we will try.' If he faces an anxious wait on the transfer front, Poyet has at least received better news on injuries with three players due to return to training. Sebastian Larsson, who damaged an ankle in Sunday's 0-0 draw at Aston Villa, is expected to train on Wednesday and could yet be available for Thursday's trip to Manchester City, although fellow midfielder Liam Bridcutt will play no part at the Etihad Stadium. Poyet said: 'Seb Larsson is going to train tomorrow. He feels much better. The injury is the kind of injury we can all react to differently. It's going to be painful for a while because he twisted his ankle badly, but the damage to the ligament is not that big. Liam Bridcutt (3rd left) has been ruled out for the game against Manchester City on New Year's Day . 'It looks bad because it's swollen, so it depends how you cope with the pain. From what I have seen, Seb is quite confident that he is going to train tomorrow. He knows it's going to hurt, but he is willing to go ahead, so he is looking good. 'Liam Bridcutt, protocol, we are going to go with the rules. There are certain rules - he looks perfect today and is desperate to get out and desperate to play because he loves the chance to play. 'But we have been talking a lot about these concussions and we are going to go with the rules, so until, I think it's Friday, he cannot even train, so we are going to keep him safe.' Meanwhile, full-backs Patrick van Aanholt and Anthony Reveillere are expected to resume training next Monday after recovering from a dislocated shoulder and a calf problem respectively with the Dutchman a week ahead of schedule.","Gus Poyet is desperate to reinforce his Sunderland squad in January .

"Manchester City striker Stevan Jovetic is relishing the champions' title battle with Chelsea - a situation helped by the return of superstar striker Sergio Aguero. City pulled alongside Chelsea at the top of the Barclays Premier League with a dramatic 3-2 win over Sunderland at the Etihad Stadium on New Year's Day, while Argentine Aguero is back in training with the City squad. Chelsea had an eight-point advantage over City in November but the two teams now have identical records, with 46 points and the same goals for and against tallies after 20 games. Sergio Aguero is all smiles as he continued his return from injury during the session on Friday . Argentine pair Martin Demichelis (left) and Pablo Zabaleta share a laugh in Manchester City training . It sets up an exciting second half of the season and City's trip to Stamford Bridge on January 31 is certain to be eagerly anticipated. Jovetic said: 'I think we must do our job well to win our games, and hopefully they are going to drop points. 'We have to play against them away and I think that is going to be a nice game.' City are in such a position after surviving a Sunderland fightback. A dull game burst into life when Yaya Toure crashed home a ferocious shot after 57 minutes and Jovetic doubled the lead nine minutes later with a neat flick. The Black Cats responded as former City players Jack Rodwell and Adam Johnson, the latter from the penalty spot, struck in the space of three minutes but the hosts hit back again. Willy Caballero, Vincent Kompany, Zabaleta and Stevan Jovetic head out for training . Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart catches a ball during after being rested on New Year's Day . Frank Lampard heads out for training following his winner against Sunderland on New Year's Day . Frank Lampard, the day after it was confirmed he would be staying for the rest of the season, headed the winner in the 73rd minute just three minutes after coming off the bench. Jovetic said: 'It was not easy. We scored for 2-0 and then thought it was going to be easier but after that they scored one goal, then the second. 'Then I think we showed our character. We know we have big character. We scored a third goal and we had so many chances after. It was an important win.' Stevan Jovetic of Manchester City celebrates his goal during the match against Sunderland . Jovetic beat Costel Pantilimon (left) to make the score 2-0 before City eventually went on to win 3-2 . Jovetic is the first of City's trio of injured strikers from December to return to action. The Montenegro international was hampered by a hamstring injury and could only watch as City fielded James Milner as a makeshift centre-forward while Sergio Aguero and Edin Dzeko were also out. He returned to action as a substitute in Sunday's draw against Burnley and now hopes for a run of games. The 25-year-old said: 'I feel good, that is important. It was my first game for two weeks to play from the beginning. 'I think because of that I came off for the last 20 minutes, but I feel better and every game I will get better.' Kompany looks cheerful during training as Manchester City prepared for their FA Cup tie . Hart practices his goal kicking while Manuel Pellegrini (right) and his coaching staff watch on . Manager Manuel Pellegrini has hinted that Dzeko could be back in contention to face Everton on January 10, with Aguero possibly returning against Arsenal the following week. Pellegrini said: 'I hope in the next week Edin Dzeko will be fit and in the next week (after that) will be Kun (Aguero).' Dzeko was injured in the warm-up prior to the win at Leicester on December 13 while Aguero, who has scored 19 times this season, suffered knee ligament damage against Everton the previous week. Jovetic is likely to continue leading the line as City host Sky Bet Championship side Sheffield Wednesday in the FA Cup third round on Sunday. He was pleased to get back on the scoresheet against Sunderland with what was a clever goal. The striker supplied Gael Clichy on the left and then burst forward to tuck in the Frenchman's cross from close range with a deft touch. He said: 'I think it was a good action. I started and then I gave the ball to Gael, and then I continued. Then the ball came I did the shot with my left foot, which is not my best foot, but I am very happy. 'It was a very nice goal.'","Steven Jovetic relishing Manchester City's title battle with Chelsea .

"Gus Poyet believes it is a ‘disgrace’ that Premier League teams play twice in 48 hours between Christmas and New Year.

Sunderland (4-1-4-1): Pantilimon; Vergini, O’Shea, Coates, Jones; Cattermole; Johnson, Gomez, Larsson, Giaccherini; Wickham . ‘We shouldn't be playing (on Sunday),’ said the Uruguayan. ‘I've been in England for a long time and I know that Boxing Day games are a tradition and I accept that and think we should maintain it. ‘But I think that then playing on the 28th is a disgrace. We shouldn't be playing then, we shouldn't. ‘If you want to see the best players performing well, you need to make sure you are not playing every two days. ‘It is not needed. That is not tradition and anyone who says it is, is not telling the truth.’ Poyet shouts out instructions from the technical area during Sunderland's loss to Hull City . The defeat came in stark contrast to last weekend's euphoric late win in the Tyne-Wear derby . Connor Wickham returns from suspension while Emanuele Giaccherini could make his first start since September. Patrick van Aanholt (shoulder) and Anthony Reveillere (calf) remain sidelined. The Black Cats failed to build on the euphoria of their Tyne-Wear derby win against Hull and their second-half performance was among their worst of the season. And Poyet says the only consolation of the 48-hour turnaround is the chance to make amends for that poor showing. ‘One of the good things is that we play again in two days - that's the only good thing about it,’ he added. ‘We need to perform better. Better decisions on the ball, not hurry and get carried away with the noise and the fans pushing us forward. ‘We have some qualities and we need to respect those qualities. For us, it is important to believe in what we do and not what people think we should be doing.’","Gus Poyet has hit out at the hectic festive programme in Premier League .

"In New York, this will not have gone down well. In Chelsea, West London, they won’t be too thrilled either. Manchester City’s decision to keep Frank Lampard in England rather than release him to fulfil an obligation to their feeder club New York City FC has been received predictably badly in the United States. At a stroke the Barclays Premier League champions have undermined the very credibility of their MLS project and alienated a customer base they have desperately been trying to court. Here on our side of the Atlantic, though, Lampard has simply proved too valuable to lose and it was perhaps to be expected that he would play a defining role in his first appearance since his decision to remain at City until the end of the season was announced late on New Year’s Eve.

What Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho thinks now of his own decision to release Lampard last summer only he will know. What is beyond doubt, though, is that the 36-year-old has already played a significant part in shaping the landscape of this Premier League season. Back in September Lampard scored his first City goal to hold Chelsea to a 1-1 draw here. On New Year's Day he scored his fifth in the league after coming off the substitutes’ bench to rescue his team when calamity beckoned for the second home game running. Having scored twice through Yaya Toure and Stevan Jovetic to lead in the second half, City were inexplicably pegged back by a Sunderland team that had spent much of the afternoon showing absolutely no attacking intent at all. But Lampard’s headed goal from a Gael Clichy cross with 15 minutes to go was straight from the back catalogue. It was born of technique, timing and anticipation and perhaps it was only to be expected. Having thrown away two points so carelessly here against Burnley at the weekend, City certainly needed something from this. Manuel Pellegrini did his best to bring some freshness to his team, resting goalkeeper Joe Hart and rotating a number of other positions. Interestingly, Lampard began the afternoon on the bench. Stevan Jovetic doubled City's advantage after 66 minutes with a cheeky flick from Gael Clichy's cross from the right .

Sunderland's John O'Shea (left) and Jordi Gomez react with dismay as Toure scores City's opening goal . For almost an hour, however, City toiled. Sunderland came to Manchester determined to frustrate the champions by setting up camp on the edge of their penalty area. Given the attacking talent they have available, one would have expected City to break through but it was only in the last half hour of the game that they found something of their true selves. Prior to that, City were very average indeed, looking just as leggy and short of ideas as they had last time out. In the first half, precious little of note actually happened. Toure – back in the team after being rested at the weekend – saw one shot blocked by a sea of red and white bodies while David Silva drove the follow-up wide. Silva himself then had a shot saved on the half an hour, as did Toure from the edge of the area moments later. It was Sunderland, however, who came closest to scoring as Sebastian Larsson brought a full length save from Willy Caballero with a right foot free-kick. At this stage referee Roger East wasn’t winning any friends at the Etihad with some decisions that angered the City faithful and the usually phlegmatic Pellegrini. City, though, were not helping themselves. Their football lacked real quality and, unusually, their discipline was sketchy too. In to the second half, though, and Toure eventually scored to bring the game to life. Some goal it was, too, as Stevan Jovetic laid the ball back to Toure and the big Ivorian drove it high past former City goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon from 20 yards.

Frank Lampard's 176th Premier League goal takes him clear of Thierry Henry and into fourth place in the division’s all-time top scorers chart. It really was a special goal and it set the tone for the rest of the afternoon. Moments later City were two ahead and seemingly home and hosed. Jovetic laid the ball off to Clichy down the left and then made terrific ground in to the penalty area to nudge the ensuing low cross in to the corner with an elaborate flick. Just as they did on Sunday, City looked comfortable and Sunderland’s race – such as it was – seemed run. Once again, though, the hosts faltered and moments after Jesus Navas ran clear to hit the post Sunderland hot back to score two goals in three minutes, both coming from former City players.

With just over a quarter of an hour to go, City were facing embarrassment and frustration for the second time in just a few days. This time, though, Lampard emerged to rescue them. The 36-year-old had only been on the field four minutes when he drifted in to the box off Wes Brown’s shoulder to head Clichy’s cross down and in to the corner, the ball brushing the post as it went in. It was a classic Lampard moment and one that showed why City have risked such a PR disaster in America in order to keep him.

"Sat in a luxurious meeting room in a hotel in downtown Chicago, Steven Gerrard was talking about the past, the present and the future. It was July 27, Liverpool had just breezed past Olympiakos in a pre-season friendly. After Gerrard had dealt with the thorny issue of what happened during the title run-in last April, then discussed what would happen in the post Luis Suarez era, the conversation turned to Frank Lampard. His old England colleague had just decided to embark on a fresh challenge in the MLS and it was put to Gerrard whether he could ever envisage a life beyond Liverpool. This was his response. Gerrard has only ever played for Liverpool, winning the Champions League in Istanbul in 2005 . Gerrard has been an inspirational captain for more than a decade, leading the team since 2003 . Gerrard was instrumental in his sides run to the Champions League final in 2005 to win their fifth European title . ‘At his age of 36, he’s had a wonderful career and I don’t think he has anything to prove in England anymore,’ said Gerrard. ‘He’s broken records with Chelsea and won everything with them. I think it’s a perfect move for him at his time. One day that might happen to me, I don’t know. ‘I’ve never really discussed it with anyone or thought about it. Maybe one day I would like the chance to go away from Liverpool for a short time and try something different. But I haven’t given it much thought. That carrot hasn’t been dangled yet.’ Now it has and it has prompted Gerrard to make a heart-rending decision. From May 23, Liverpool Football Club will no longer have their talismanic No 8 to turn to. There was always going to be a day when Liverpool and Gerrard were no more but, even still, the news takes some getting used to. Like Jamie Carragher (left) Gerrard's departure will leave a void that is impossible to fill . Liverpool now have a job to do replacing two club legends who will leave within two years of each other . Gerrard has been offered a new deal by his club, but will not sign a deal beyond the end of the season . Gerrard was man of the match in the 2006 FA Cup final, scoring twice to help Liverpool lift the trophy . Gerrard fast established himself as a fans favourite and has stayed with Liverpool for 17 years . There has been a lot of noise this season about Gerrard, his form and whether he can still contribute in the Barclays Premier League. He might not be the rampaging force of nature who, 10 years ago, inspired that night in Istanbul but his role runs deeper than what happens on the pitch. Gerrard, along with Jamie Carragher, provided the heart and soul to Liverpool during countless changes since the turn of the Millennium and has always been on hand to say or do the right thing at the right time. They had been the link between the terrace and the squad. Carragher has never been adequately replaced in the 18 months since his retirement but if manager Brendan Rodgers had a hard job looking for a new No 23, he is now faced with an impossible challenge to find someone who will adequately fill that No 8 jersey. Gerrard has never won the Premier League title, coming closest last season when Liverpool fell just short . Since making his Liverpool debut in 1998 Gerrard has played almost 500 league games for the club . This decision is something Gerrard has been wrestling with for months, the excitement of pursuing a new challenge somewhere else always being counterbalanced by the love and affinity he has for Liverpool, the club he grew up dreaming he would one day represent. He will not want the next five months to become overly nostalgic and he will be committed to helping Liverpool obtain their highest possible finish in the Premier League, while hoping that, perhaps, there will be one final day at Wembley. Once the end of May arrives, though, that will be it. And Liverpool will never be the same again.","Steven Gerrard confirms he will leave Liverpool at the end of this season .

"Tottenham striking sensation Harry Kane was once on arch-rivals Arsenal's books. The centre forward has been the star man for Mauricio Pochettino this season, his goal scoring exploits pushing him towards the England senior side. But his career could have panned out much differently had Arsenal not let him slip through the net. Harry Kane has been in sensational form for Tottenham - most recently netting a double against the Blues . Nacer Chadli (right) celebrates with the in-form Spurs forward after scoring their fifth goal of the afternoon . Kane and team-mate Nabil Bentaleb celebrate at the final whistle as Tottenham moved up to fifth . Playing for Ridgeway Rovers in east London, the same youth side David Beckham and Andros Townsend played for, Kane was scouted by Gunners spies and joined the club as an eight-year-old. He spent a year in the red half of north London before returning to his amateur childhood side after Arsenal let him leave. From Ridgeway, he joined Watford's youth set up where he spent two months before being snapped up by Tottenham as an 11-year-old. And he has been at Spurs ever since, making his mark in the first-team this season with his excellent goal scoring run. How Arsenal could do with Kane now following their current striker crisis. After a stunning first half of the season Kane is now in line to make the step up to the England senior side . Kane impressed on loan at Millwall during the second half of the 2011-12 season - scoring nine goals . Kane celebrates scoring for Leicester against Blackburn during his brief spell at the Foxes two years ago . The 21-year-old has also spent time at the likes of Norwich and Leyton Orient over the years . The 21-year-old was again in inspired form for Pochettino's men on Thursday evening, notching a double as Tottenham beat London rivals Chelsea for the first time in five seasons in a thrilling encounter at White Hart Lane. After the 5-3 win Kane said: 'It shows how good we are, scoring five goals against one of the best defences in the world and it is all coming together. ‘We are delighted, we want to keep this run going. I am enjoying it, especially as we get so much stick from the Chelsea supporters.’","Harry Kane was picked up by Arsenal as an eight-year-old after impressing for his local side Ridgeway Rovers in east London .

"The world-famous Swedish Ice Hotel has been forced to install a fire alarm. The hotel, which is rebuilt every year, was refused planning permission lest they install one on the premises. However, this soon proved not to be an outlandish request, as the alarm went off when a guest lit a cigarette in a cleaning cupboard. Scroll down for video . Fire hazard: The world-famous Ice Hotel in Jukkasjarvi, Sweden has been forced to install a fire alarm as part of this year's building process . Despite the entire hotel, including . all furniture and appliances inside it, being built from ice from river . near Jukkasjärvi, Kiruna, the National Housing Board threatened to put a . stop to this year’s construction. Following a test period during last season it was deemed necessary in order for the Ice Hotel to get planning permission. ‘We were a bit surprised, but you just have to accept the situation, press officer Beatrice Karlsson told Dagens Nyheter. ‘Tests . were made to see if there are items which can catch fire. It would be . sheep- and reindeer skins, pillows and matrasses, but the risk of it . happening is not that big,’ she added.

Surprisingly, the smoke alarm installed during the test period last year went off. ‘It was a guest sneaking a smoke in the cleaning cupboard. So it was nothing too serious.’ The Jukkasjarvi ice hotel prides itself on being the first of its kind in the world, first opening in 1990.

"Derby matches are great. They allow players and fans alike to have bragging rights for a period of time. They were the fixtures I looked forward to the most and I loved playing in them. But not in Scotland! When I was at Bath, the West Country derbies against Bristol and Gloucester were brilliant matches to be a part of. They were ferocious on and off the park especially at Kingsholm where I was made very welcome being captain of Bath and Scottish! They were the highlight of the season and, on many occasions, produced outstanding matches with both sides throwing everything at the opposition with the objective to score as many points as possible to humiliate your near neighbours. Glasgow Warriors' Al Kellock leaps the highest for a line-out during his side's match against Edinburgh . This changed when I moved back to play for Glasgow. Suddenly, the derby against Edinburgh turned into a turgid affair when both sides seemed paralysed by the fear of losing to their nearest rival. One reason for this was they were seen as National Trials when you faced up to a player who you were battling with for the Scotland team. This meant lots of players went into their shells and made damn sure the opposition team and individual player did nothing to improve their chances of being selected for the national team. This is what happened on Saturday at Scotstoun. Glasgow and Edinburgh produced a forgettable match in front of an excited and expectant capacity crowd who deserved so much more in terms of intent and quality. The irony of this is that Edinburgh do not have that many Scottish-qualified players but it was still seen as a trial. Glasgow won the game and will take the four points on offer but that was just about all they will take from this. They stay second in the league and on course for a home play-off but they will need to play a whole lot better if this is to be achieved. Worryingly, one of their most consistent performers this season, Rob Harley, went off with a nasty looking leg injury which will definitely keep him out of the return match at Murrayfield and time will tell how many other games. His work rate has laid the platform that has allowed the Warriors to perform and, although they have strength in depth in this area, the injuries are mounting with Adam Ashe and Chris Fusaro and he will be missed. Glasgow Warriors' Josh Strauss (left) scores a try in his side's 16-6 win over Edinburgh . Both sides put in plenty of perspiration but lacked any real inspiration. Glasgow scored the only try of the game after great set up play from Sean Lamont and Peter Horne allowed Josh Strauss to score. They should have had a second try when DTH van der Merve was judged to have made a forward pass to Nico Matawalu when it looked perfectly good to me. Referee George Clancy did not refer it to the TMO which was surprising as every decision, these days, seems to be referred. I wonder if this was the reason that Clancy did not refer it, he wanted to show that he could make the call on his own. Even so, it was the wrong call. Edinburgh have improved as the season has developed. If this game had taken part in the first few weeks of the season on hard ground and Glasgow flying and Edinburgh really struggling, Glasgow would have won by 40 points. But Edinburgh have made themselves tough to play against and defended really well in the tackle and competed really well at the breakdown. The Edinburgh Rugby players gather for a huddle before the match on Saturday . They were a much better attacking threat in the second half when Tom Heathcote came on at stand-off which allowed Greig Tonks to move to his best position of full back. He made a number of good runs and showed his class. I hope he remains at full back for the return game on Friday. The turgid nature of the game and the lack of ambition of either side played right into Edinburgh’s hands. They were very comfortable in the arm wrestle the match became but had no answer when Glasgow played their off-loading game which should have given them two tries. This means the 1872 Cup is, theoretically, still up for grabs in the return. It should have been over as Glasgow were much better than the 10-point winning margin suggested but Edinburgh will have a real go at Murrayfield. The big pitch will suit the Warriors but my only wish is that we have a much better game than we saw at Scotstoun on Saturday.

"Alex Corbisiero knows he must usurp a world-class rival if he is to mark his latest injury comeback with a recall to England’s starting XV for the Six Nations. Northampton’s 26-year-old prop has returned early from shoulder surgery and will play against Newcastle at Franklin’s Gardens on Friday as the next step towards challenging Joe Marler for the national No 1 shirt. Corbisiero has endured a prolonged spell of medical misfortune, which has limited him to just four Test caps in the last two years — two of them for the triumphant Lions in Australia. Alex Corbisiero has recently returned to action having dislocated his shoulder against Bath in September . However, his spirit has not been broken by the setbacks which have disrupted his stellar career. ‘It’s very hard, but I focus on the controllables,’ he said. ‘I do everything I can to be in the best shape, to recover and be proactive about preventing injuries. 'I’ve had some bad luck, but it’s not going to dampen my heart. I’m looking to play each week, play my heart out, and — hope to God — avoid injury.’ In light of the latest injury, he added: ‘As I’ve got older and had to deal with some hard times, your mental toughness and maturity steps in. I focused on planning my rehab, planning my return and everything I needed to make sure I got back as quickly as possible. Joe Marler (centre), riding a challenge against Australia, has impressed for Harlequins and England in 2014 . Marler and Corbisiero provide healthy competition for England ahead of the Six Nations at prop . ‘That’s the mindset I had from day one: that there was no time to sit and pity myself. I have come back in the minimum time the surgeons would allow.’ Once he is back into his stride with champions Northampton, Corbisiero will set his sights on England, but Harlequins captain Marler will be difficult to shift from the front row. ‘Joe has been outstanding. He is one of the top performers in the world in his position,’ said Corbisiero. ‘With Joe playing so well, if I want to get back in I have to play better.’ Having missed the last two Six Nations through injury, his desire to be involved is a strong driving force. ‘It is more than frustrating to sit out and watch back-to-back Six Nations,’ he said. ‘Hopefully, if I do get myself healthy and put my hand up to be in that environment, I will make the most of it.’ Corbisiero starred for the Lions in their series victory over Australia in 2013 and scored a try in the third Test . The 26-year-old hopes to get back to his form during the victorious 2013 Lions Tour in Australia .","26-year-old has endured a spell of injuries with four Test caps in two years .

"Owen Farrell laughs at the suggestion that professional rugby’s academy system puts too much pressure on players to bulk up. In a month when the RFU’s treasured academy system has come in for some heavy flak - with Brian O’Driscoll and Nick Easter among the high-profile critics of the northern hemisphere’s apparent obsession with size over skill - Saracens’ ‘Class of 2008’ take a very different view. ‘Yes’ it was tough, they say. ‘Yes’ at times the exercise regime bordered on ""madness"". But was the pain endured in the gym and on the training ground worth it? They think so. Saracens' Class of 2008: Academy graduates (from left) George Kruis, Jackson Wray, Will Fraser, Owen Farrell and Jamie George, who are now shining for the north London club in the senior and international ranks . ‘I enjoyed it,’ said Farrell, one of five current Saracens first-team regulars who joined the club in 2008 and went through the Academy together. ‘It was hard, but I needed it. ‘I remember doing twice as much in pre-season as the first team did. We needed to get to where they were. We did two skills sessions a day when they’d do one. We did more weights too. ‘There was a reason for it. We needed to get up to their standard. I enjoyed it and we enjoyed it as a group. As a group we pushed each other pretty well. It’s half the reason that we’re here now.’ There are nods of agreement around the table in a hospitality box at Allianz Park as Farrell’s team-mates and friends George Kruis, Will Fraser, Jamie George and Jackson Wray concur with the England fly-half. The demands on a modern-professional rugby player are enormous. No-one doubts that. The game is more physical than it has ever been, the ball is in play longer than it has ever been, and the collisions are greater than they have ever been. It is a tough, uncompromising professional sport still finding its way both on and off the field after the transition from an amateur game in 1995. Academies are a product of the age. ‘The best thing was the culture we created within the Academy itself,’ said George, who now has 106 first-team appearances. Farrell is hugely supportive of the demanding academy system which made him the player he is . ‘The only pressure was the pressure we put on each other. We set standards of pushing each other hard and doing the extras to try to be the best. ‘That takes the pressure off. You only feel pressure if you don’t work hard enough. The reason we’re all here is because we worked hard when we were younger and are still working hard today.’ As scouting and junior representative selection processes have improved, academies have formed the bridge between life on the inside of professional rugby and life on the outside. Not every player in the top-flight goes through the system, but it is increasingly rare to find players such as Easter and Gloucester’s Ben Morgan, who slip through the net. ‘It was tough, but a massive part of it was actually not to do with the physical side,’ said flanker Wray, a schoolboy hammer thrower from Essex who took rugby up aged 14 and was signed by Saracens two years later. ‘It’s more to do with the mental side. [Former Saracens coach] Eddie Jones was tough on a lot of people. But it was what made us who we are now. We were in at 6.30 in the morning, getting up at 5am. ‘It was part of the learning experience that you need to go through. We were in first and out last. Always do more. Some of the training sessions were just mental. But they needed to be. You can’t compare now to then.’ Wray (second from left) says their academy education was mental as much as it was physical . All five men agree that, five years after they were in the system, the academies have improved. Whereas they trained in isolation from the first-team, today’s crop - which includes 6ft 5in, 18 stone England U20s captain Maro Itoje - are fully integrated with the first team in order to smooth the transition between the two. Easter, O’Driscoll and many others argue more emphasis should be placed on skills at the expense of weights lifted. Earlier this month RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie admitted he was concerned about doping in the sport among junior players with more rugby players currently serving suspensions than any other sport. None of those suspensions have been in the professional game, but Ritchie’s concern is shared by some. ‘We all go through different stages of growth and if people are putting pressure on you to do it [dope] my message to them is that it’s not worth it,’ says recent England cap Kruis, 24, who shed his nickname of ‘String Bean’ after adding two stone in his first season in the Academy under the direction of strength and conditioning coach and former Academy team-mate Andy Edwards. Fraser, who would surely be an England regular by now if were not for an horrendous run of injuries, adds: ‘If you want to get big then there are proper ways to do it. As George said, you can get one lad who is huge at 14 and one kid who is tiny who then suddenly overtakes him. You’ve just got to let nature take its course. Manchester United's 'Class of 92' (from second left after youth team coach Eric Harrison) Ryan Giggs, Nicky Butt, David Beckham, Gary Neville, Phil Neville, Paul Scholes and Terry Cooke proved you could win with kids . ‘You’ve got five lads here who have been through a whole junior and senior Academy and not a single one of us have ever come close to it [doping] or had it mentioned to us.’ The five men are firm friends as well as team-mates. Wray recently became the first to have a child when his girlfriend Leanne gave birth to baby Harper. ‘We share each other’s happiness on and off the field,’ George says. The quintet have a been at the club during a period of unparalleled success which has seen them win the Premiership for the first time in 2011, as well as reaching two other domestic league finals, while last season they reached the Heineken Cup final for the first time in the club’s history, only to be blown away by a Jonny Wilkinson driven Toulon machine. It hardly stands comparison to Manchester United’s legendary ‘Class of 92’, but with time on their side and an apparent desire to remain at the club they joined as teenagers the potential for this group is enormous. Farrell takes in a breather as Saracens scrape past Newcastle 25-23 on Saturday . Wing Chris Ashton (centre) celebrates scoring a try with scrum-half Richard Wigglesworth . ‘It would be incredible to get to the end of our careers and be able to look back and say: “I’ve spent my entire rugby journey with the same group of lads”. ‘We’re friends for life anyway, but to have that connection throughout our whole careers would be very, very rare and something I’ll try to hold on to.’ The five head in to the New Year with much work to do. The north Londoners lie fourth in the AvivaPremiership following yesterday’s 25-23 victory at Newcastle while they must win at home to Munster and away to Clermont to stand a realistic chance of qualifying from the toughest of European pools. But they will do so with the tightest five the Premiership has seen. Five who, fitnessand form permitting,could still be at Allianz Park for many years to come.","Owen Farrell, George Kruis, Will Fraser, Jamie George and Jackson Wray are all products of the Saracens Academy system .

"Steve Smith continued his unbeaten run with a half century in his first test as captain, guiding Australia to 221-4 in reply to India's 408 before bad light stopped play on day two of the second test. Smith, standing in for injured captain Michael Clarke, followed up his unbeaten 162 and 52 in the first test win last week with an unbeaten 65 on Thursday. Momentum swung around on another sultry day at the Gabba, which finished under stormy skies. Nine wickets fell in the first two sessions on day two, after India resumed at a commanding 311-4. The Australians took six wickets for 97 to dismiss India before lunch, with paceman Josh Hazlewood snaring 5-68 on his test debut and wicketkeeper Brad Haddin equaling an Australian record with six catches. Captain Steve Smith led Australia's response to India's first innings total of 408 on day two at The Gabba . Smith scored a half-century as Australia reached 221-4 at stumps on day two of the second Test . Australia lost three wickets for 121 in the middle session, before putting on 100 for the loss of one wicket after tea. Umesh Yadav was the pick of India's bowlers, taking 3-48 from 13 overs. The Australian top order made starts but failed to go on, with David Warner (29) and Shane Watson (25) falling to bad shots before Chris Rogers was out on the last ball before tea for 55, his first test half century since February. Smith and Shaun Marsh, recalled to the batting lineup in the absence of Clarke, combined for 87 runs in as many minutes to get the hosts within 200 before the fourth wicket fell. Shave Watson celebrates dismissing Rohit Sharma as India lost their last six wickets for 97 runs . Opening batsman Chris Rogers got Australia off to a solid start with a half-century .

Smith thumped Ravi Ashwin over the long-on boundary twice and cut him for four in an over, yielding 16 runs after the Indian off-spinner had conceded just 19 runs in his first 11 overs. Marsh, who twice dropped Murali Vijay on Wednesday before the Indian opener scored 144, had his own reprieve on 32 but didn't make it pay. He top-edged an attempted pull shot against Varun Aaron, skying the ball to leg gully, where Ajinkya Rahane put down a regulation chance that was well within range of wicketkeeper and skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Smith came in and steadied the ship for Australia, putting on 87 for the fourth wicket with Shaun Marsh . Marsh didn't add to his score before he was out two overs later, edging a steeply-rising ball from Yadav to Ravi Ashwin at slip. On 63, Smith looked up to the sky to acknowledge his former teammate Phillip Hughes, who was on that score in a Sheffield Shield match last month when he was hit by a short ball and later died in hospital. The four-test series against India series was rescheduled after Hughes' death, and Australia's players are again wearing black armbands in his honor. Earlier, India started the day with high expectations of continuing an assault on a beleaguered Australian bowling attack that wilted in hot and humid conditions on day one. Bad light ended play early on day two with the second Test match of the series evenly poised . But both of India's overnight batsmen were out quickly with Rahane (81) edging Hazlewood to Haddin and Rohit Sharma (32) spectacularly caught by a diving Smith at second slip from Watson's second ball of the morning. Hazlewood then switched ends and removed Ravi Ashwin (35) and Dhoni (33) to hasten India's slide. 'That was a pretty important time - to get a few early ones today was crucial to our success,' Hazlewood said. Haddin's six dismissals equaled the Australian test record for wicketkeepers, shared by Wally Grout, Rod Marsh and Ian Healy. He went close to matching the world record of seven dismissals by a `keeper but missed a catch off Nathan Lyon's bowling near the end of the innings. Lyon, who picked up 12 wickets in Australia's 48-run win in the first test last week, took the last two wickets and returned 3-105.","Australia close day two at The Gabba on 221-4 in reply to India's 408 .

"Australia all-rounder Shane Watson is said to be 'a bit shaken but OK' after taking a blow to the head during training at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Tuesday. The 33-year-old was hit on the helmet from a James Pattinson delivery in the nets session as Australia prepare for the Boxing Day Test against India, while Mitchell Starc also suffered a nasty blow while batting at the MCG. Pattinson's short ball floored Watson as he landed on his backside before slowly removing his helmet and walking out of the nets. Shane Watson was forced to cut short his nets session after being hit in the head by a bouncer . The Australian batsman required attention from the team doctor Peter Brukner (left) James Pattinson bowled the ball to Watson, and the bowler was also shaken up by the incident . The incident happened less than a month after Phillip Hughes died after being hit on the head by a bouncer . A Cricket Australia spokesperson said the dazed Watson was 'shaken but otherwise OK' while vice-captain Brad Haddin later confirmed his team-mate had escaped unscathed. He told www.cricket.com.au: 'I had a chat to him - he's a bit shaken, but he's OK. It's just getting hit in the head. 'He's shaken as anyone would be. I can't really go into any more details because there's no more details to give.' Following the incident Pattinson was also said to be visibly shaken before being assessed by Australia team doctor Peter Brukner. In light of Phillip Hughes' death last month, Watson's knock underlined the heightened emotional reactions to batsmen being hit in the head or helmet at this time. Watson was playing for New South Wales on November 25 when the Hughes was struck by the ball that led to his tragic death and he spoke earlier this month about the difficulties he faced in preparing mentally for the Test series against India. He said: 'It's been the most challenging, mentally, couple of days I've had to go through in my career. Trying to process everything that happened, especially being there at the SCG. A Cricket Australia spokesman confirmed that Watson was OK after being shaken up by the incident . Australian team doctor Brukner attends to Watson after he was hit on the head by a bouncer . Watson talks to Australian coach Darren Lehmann during practice for the third Test . 'Some guys are a bit more affected than others, but every session we were out there you can see everyone starting to gradually find their feet and getting back to what we love doing. There's a lot of inner demons we've had to find our way through.' The pressure is mounting on Watson to make runs during this four-match series which Australia now lead 2-0 - he has made 72 runs at an average of 18 in two Tests - and there will be more expectations on his broad shoulders given his fellow all-rounder Mitch Marsh has been ruled out of the third Test due to injury. Just 10 minutes earlier - batting in the nets alongside Watson - Starc was hit on his knee, and limped out of the nets. But Haddin joked: 'I think he's trying to get out of having to bowl. He's all right. He just hit the ball onto the inside of his knee.'

"Louis van Gaal admits Manchester United have no chance of winning the title unless their away form improves. United stretched their unbeaten run to 10 matches at Stoke on New Year's Day, but they could not secure victory. Instead, they had to settle for a 1-1 draw as Radamel Falcao cancelled out Ryan Shawcross' second-minute strike. Louis van Gaal admits Manchester United have no chance of winning the title unless their away form picks up . United settled for a 1-1 draw as Radamel Falcao (pictured) cancelled out Ryan Shawcross' early opener . Chelsea's shock defeat at Tottenham meant United's standing in the league actually improved despite the disappointing stalemate at the Britannia Stadium. Van Gaal's team are now nine points behind new leaders Manchester City, but the United boss knows his team would be just three points shy of the summit had they won rather than drawn their last three away games at Aston Villa, Spurs and Stoke. 'When you want to win the league you have to win away from home, and at the minute we aren't doing that,' Van Gaal said. 'We aren't losing, but we aren't winning either. If you want to be a champion, you have to win these games.' In reality, United were lucky to leave a blustery Staffordshire with a point. Mame Biram Diouf missed a very good chance to put the hosts 2-0 up and they were unlucky not to be awarded a penalty in the second half when Peter Crouch's header struck Chris Smalling's arm in the box. United manager Van Gaal: 'When you want to win the league you have to win away from home' Stoke manager Mark Hughes was angry with referee Michael Oliver for not awarding the spot-kick, and for waving away another penalty appeal when Geoff Cameron was held in the box following a frantic scramble that came after Crouch had struck the woodwork. 'We had two clear penalties that should have been given,' the Stoke manager said. 'With the first one it was a goal-bound header and he (Smalling) has made an intentional movement with his arm to bat the ball down. 'The referee is standing four or five yards away. Why he hasn't given it, I don't know. I haven't spoke to the ref about it. It's a waste of time. 'He will no doubt say the lad couldn't get out of the way because he was too close maybe but I don't think that was the case. 'And when we hit the post from Peter's header it's come back out and Geoff Cameron has been taken out, he was waiting to put the ball over the line and was taken out. From our point of view they were two clear-cut penalties.' United, meanwhile, will be without Ashley Young for some time after he pulled up with a hamstring injury in the second half. 'He will be out for many weeks,' Van Gaal said. A different angle of the incident shows  that the ball hits Chris Smalling's arm after Peter Crouch's header . The ball clearly hits the arm of Manchester United defenderSmalling on the way through to goal . Stoke manager Mark Hughes was unhappy with the controversial decision and others at the Britannia . It was a quiet game for Michael Oliver. The only real talking point was the penalty for the Chris Smalling handball. His arms were up in an unnatural position, so it should have been a penalty. Manchester United have certainly had a lucky Christmas in terms of penalties awarded against them, with the Stoke incident the clearest of three. United had one given against them versus Newcastle on Boxing Day, but there should have been another earlier in the game at Old Trafford, when Juan Mata tripped Yoan Gouffran. At White Hart Lane two days later, Wayne Rooney clearly held Harry Kane toward the end of the game as a corner was taken, but appeals were waved away. Louis van Gaal's side are riding their luck.","Louis van Gaal's Manchester United settled for a 1-1 draw against Stoke .

"This past year has provided us with a catalogue of major sporting incidents - with the World Cup in Brazil being the highlight of 2014 when it comes to football. Manchester United's decision to sack David Moyes was big news in April and our coverage of the summer transfer window also attracted an impressive amount of readers to our website. Away from football and Jules Bianchi's horror smash at the Japanese Grand Prix was a major talking point in October. Here, in descending order are the top 10 articles on MailOnline in 2014: . 10 - Jules Bianchi's horror smash at the Japanese Grand Prix . Back in October 2014 Jules Bianchi suffered a serious head injury following an accident at the Japanese Grand Prix. The Marussia driver required surgery following the collision with the back of the recovery vehicle on lap 43 of the Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka. The 25-year-old is currently having rehabilitation therapy, and while he remains unconscious he is breathing unaided. Jules Bianchi suffered a serious head injury in crash with back of recovery vehicle at Japanese Grand Prix . 9 - Serbia vs Albania match abandoned by Martin Atkinson after drone used to fly flag over the pitch leads to violent scenes . The match between Serbia and Albania was called off after home defender Stefan Mitrovic pulled down a flag carried by a drone - leading to chaos on the field and in the stands of the Partizan Stadium. It led to the arrest of the brother of the Albanian Prime Minister and Serbia were handed a 3-0 victory after their opponents were deemed to have forfeited the match. The visitors were also fined £78,000 for the incident on October 14, despite their claims of leaving the field due to being physically assaulted by Serbia fans, players and security staff. Albania forward Bekim Balaj is struck by a chair thrown by a Serbian fan as tensions boiled over . 8 - David Moyes SACKED as Manchester United manager after ill-fated stint . He was proclaimed the chosen one after he took over from arguably the greatest manager of this generation - Sir Alex Ferguson - but things didn't quite pan out for David Moyes at Old Trafford. The former Everton boss lasted just 10 months at the helm, getting sacked on April 22 2014, with United languishing in seventh place in the Premier League. While United now lie third under new boss Louis van Gaal this season, Moyes is rebuilding his reputation in La Liga with Real Sociedad. David Moyes was sacked as Manchester United manager in April with them seventh in the Premier League . Moyes started work at Old Trafford on July 1 2013 but was sacked just 10 months later . 7 - Club-by-club guide to all the business done in the January transfer window . After the end of the January transfer window we tallied up all the deals from each club and put together individual tables for you to easily access. The transfer which stood out from most in the January 2014 window was Juan Mata's £37million move from Chelsea to rivals Manchester United. Then United manager Moyes would have hoped the Spanish playmaker would give his side a much-needed lift going into the second half of the campaign, but it wasn't enough to save the Scot's job as he was sacked later in the year in April. United boss Moyes is all smiles with Juan Mata after landing the Spaniard in the January transfer window . Kurt Zouma joined Chelsea for £12.5million from Saint Etienne - but was loaned back to the French side . 6 - Club-by-club guide to all the business done in the summer transfer window .

Arsenal pulled off a huge coup signing Alexis Sanchez for £30m from Spanish giants Barcelona . Manchester United made a dramatic deadline day signing in the shape of Radamel Falcao from Monaco . 5. Brazil thrashed by Germany in epic World Cup semi-final clash . The host nation were eyeing a spot in the World Cup final ahead of this match against the Germans, but those hopes would soon crumble as Joachim Low's men ran rampant. Brazil were already 5-0 down before the clock hit 30 minutes in one of the most extraordinary World Cup games of all time. Chelsea playmaker Oscar hit a consolation deep into stoppage time for the hosts, but it was too little too late as the Germans ran out 7-1 winners - eventually going on to win the tournament. Thomas Muller celebrates scoring the opening goal of the night for Germany against Brazil . Brazil players look despondent after Miroslav Klose nets his second of the night in the 7-1 thrashing in July . 4 - Neymar's World Cup injury woes .

Then, of course, it got worse against the Germans... Neymar lays on the floor in agony after breaking a bone in his back against Colombia at the World Cup . 3 - Olivier Giroud in trouble after picture . Giroud had to issue an apology when it was revealed he had taken a female companion back to Arsenal's team hotel ahead of their match against Crystal Palace.

"Just over a month ago, Alan Pardew sat down with Newcastle’s inner circle to discuss the club’s targets for the January transfer window. It was a short meeting. Mike Ashley was content, delighted with his club’s climb up the table after their failure to register a victory in the Barclays Premier League until they beat Leicester on October 18. But Pardew, who was named LMA manager of the year in 2012 after guiding Newcastle to fifth and the Europa League, is an ambitious man. Newcastle boss Alan Pardew is expected to be imminently appointed as Crystal Palace's new manager . Pardew masterminded Newcastle to a 3-2 Premier League home win against Everton on Sunday . Pardew applauds the home crowd after their victory at St James' Park against the Toffees . Alan Pardew becomes new Crystal Palace boss as Newcastle United thrash out £2million compensation deal with Eagles . Jamie Redknapp says Pardew's move makes sense - he is going somewhere he is loved . Jamie Carragher believes Palace will never be as big a club as Newcastle so there must have been a good reason for Pardew to walk . Any manager looking to send their CV for the Magpies job must beware . Steve Bruce would jump at the opportunity to manage his boyhood club . Micky Quinn believes Newcastle must appoint a Geordie as their next manager . He wanted to add quality to the team, attracting players with pedigree to St James’ Park in order to have a genuine crack at getting back into the top four. Ashley was having none of it. As Pardew prepares to start work at Crystal Palace, his biggest beef with his former employers at Newcastle is that he did not get to choose the players. Instead they are scouted by Graham Carr and deposited at their Darsley Park training ground for Pardew to use as he sees fit. Last summer, for example, a young Argentinian striker by the name of Facundo Ferreyra arrived on loan from Shakhtar Donetsk for the season. Ferreyra, 23, has yet to play and on Monday one source at the club described him as one of the worst players ever seen at this level. Two more signings, Karl Darlow and Jamaal Lascelles, arrived in the summer and were immediately sent on loan to Nottingham Forest before Pardew could even assess them. As the transfer window approaches, Pardew fears Moussa Sissoko, one of the club’s best players, will be picked off by Arsenal or Paris Saint-Germain. Last year, after influential midfielder Yohan Cabaye was sold to PSG for £19m on January 29, they lost 11 of their last 14 games in the Premier League. He was wary of a repeat should Sissoko be sold. On loan striker Facundo Ferreyra is yet to feature  this season since joining from Shakhtar Donetsk . The 23-year-old has been describes as one of the worst players ever seen at this level by one source . Magpies lost 11 of their last 14 games in the Premier League last term after selling Yohan Cabaye (left) to PSG . Cabaye was sold to the French giants for £19million in the 2014 January transfer window . Moussa Sissoko could leave in January after Arsenal and Paris Saint-Germain declared an interest . Newcastle’s manager wants a real input into the teams he sends out in front of some of the most demanding supporters in the country, many of whom have never accepted him. His appointment reportedly received the backing of only five per cent of fans in a poll at the time, while the SackPardew.com and P45Due campaigns hurt him more than he will ever let on. Now is the time to make a clean break. On Monday the manager was at his family home in Surrey, waiting for Ashley to respond from his holiday home in Barbados before he could return home for good. Despite the tensions at St James’ Park, particularly over transfer strategy, Pardew has an excellent relationship with Ashley. He appreciated the owner’s support during their bleak start to the season and was taken by surprise when Ashley made an impromptu visit to the dressing room after that win against Leicester. Newcastle fans hold up a 'Pardew is a muppet' banner ahead of their team's  League clash vs Stoke in April . The Newcastle fans wanted Pardew out after a difficult start to the 2014-15 Premier League campaign . The SackPardew.com became an infamous protest many unhappy Newcastle supporters this season . Newcastle fans portray Pardew as Pinocchio during their clash at Stoke in September . Now that he has found a way out of the complex eight-year Newcastle contract he signed in September 2012, Pardew will have the backing of Palace’s four owners. Although Steve Parish, Stephen Browett, Martin Long and Jeremy Hosking are equal shareholders, Parish is the most prominent. Undoubtedly, though, the appointment of Pardew will meet with the approval of all four. To them it will feel as though he is coming home. Pardew served Palace with distinction in the Eighties and very early Nineties, scoring the winner in the FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool in April 1990. There is an emotional pull for Pardew, who came through a difficult start to his career at Selhurst Park. Mark Bright, now the club’s official ambassador and a sounding board for Parish, knows Pardew well from his own playing days at Palace and will make sure he settles quickly. Pardew played more than 100 games for Palace during a four-year spell at the south London club . Pardew (No 11) scores the winning goal for  Palace in the 1990 FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool . Setting aside the size of Newcastle United and the 52,000 supporters who watch the team each week at St James’ Park, Pardew and Palace appear to be a good fit. Since the Eagles takeover in 2010, Pardew has been on friendly terms with Parish and he is a regular guest in the boardroom when he watches games at Selhurst Park. Parish has been tempted to appoint him on several occasions and he was under consideration again before plumping for Neil Warnock in August. After Warnock was sacked following the 3-1 defeat against Southampton on Boxing Day, the deal for Pardew began to fall into place. Since then, Ashley has been negotiating Pardew’s release from his sun lounger in the Caribbean. Ashley is wary of the upheaval, the inevitable change in atmosphere at a club after a manager leaves on his own terms instead of the owner’s. It is an unusual situation. Pardew, who has spent four years at Newcastle, leaves a team ninth in the Premier League table for one fighting against relegation with 19 games left of the season. His brief is to keep the team in the division, to build on the brilliant work of Tony Pulis. But now that he is back in south London, the signings must be all down to him. Tony Pulis (centre) worked wonders at Crystal Palace, and it is now up to Pardew to continue his good work . Palace are stepping up their search to replace former boss Neil Warnock and have earmarked Pardew . Newcastle owner Mike Ashley, who is currently in Barbados, will have the final say on Pardew's future . Ashley has agreed to reach a compromise with Eagles chief Steve Parish rather than demand the full £5m .","Newcastle boss Alan Pardew is expected to take over at Crystal Palace .

The players were how you would expect them to be. Quiet but respectful. It was the first time I’d ever had to give a speech like that. Never before in my career.' 4) 'I lost my balance, making my body unstable and falling on top of my opponent.

I can't protect people who don't want to run and train, and are about three stone overweight.' 8) 'The last 18 months we have been on a magic carpet ride of development but we still have a lot of growth to make.

"Newcastle United could be without top scorer Papiss Cisse until February 21 if he is given a three-match ban or more for elbowing Everton defender Seamus Coleman. Cisse was charged with violent conduct by the FA on Monday after Sky Sports cameras picked up the striker swinging his elbow in to Coleman's face on three occasions, connecting at least once. A three-match ban would see him ruled out of the New Year's Day clash at St James' Park against Burnley as well as visits to Leicester in the FA Cup and Chelsea in the Premier League. Newcastle forward Papiss Cisse (circled) has been charged after elbowing Everton's Seamus Coleman . Coleman confronts Cisse after the incident which knocked him to the floor . Burnley (H), Jan 1 - Premier League . Leicester (A), Jan 3 - FA Cup . Chelsea (A), Jan 10 - Premier League . Southampton (H), Jan 17 - Premier League . Hull (A), Jan 31 - Premier League . Stoke (H), Feb 8 - Premier League . Crystal Palace (A), Feb 11 - Premier League . Cisse has until 6pm on Tuesday to respond to the charge and if, as expected, he is banned he could miss Newcastle's next seven matches as he is due to fly out to Equatorial Guinea with Senegal for the Africa Cup of Nations next month. AFCON runs from January 17 until February 8, meaning Cisse will miss Newcastle's home fixture against Southampton on January 17 and their trip to Hull on January 31. Should much-fancied Senegal progress to the latter stages then Cisse will also miss the St James' Park clash against Stoke on February 8 and probably the trip to Crystal Palace on February 11. With the club set to lose manager Alan Pardew to Palace, Cisse's unavailability is a blow they cannot afford. The forward scored his ninth of the season in the 3-2 win over Everton on Sunday but his elbow on Coleman looks like it will have more significance than that strike come the end of the season. Cisse celebrates with Jack Colback after he scored in Newcastle's 3-2 win on Sunday .","Papiss Cisse charged with violent conduct after elbowing Seamus Coleman .

"Hartlepool United were forced to make a U-turn in their attempts to sign convicted rapist Ched Evans after a backlash from supporters and the town’s MP. Fans of the Football League’s bottom club took to social media and online forums to express their displeasure at comments from new manager Ronnie Moore declaring an interest in signing the 25-year-old, who was released from prison in October after serving half of a five-year sentence for the rape of a 19-year-old woman in a hotel room in 2011.

VIDEO Scroll down to watch Ched Evans' video statement regarding his appeal . Striker Ched Evans used to play for Sheffield United but is now searching for a new club . Hartlepool MP Iain Wright had been critical of moves to bring the striker in, and praised the U-turn . ‘I think it would have been a terrible move for the club and I think it would have split the fans,’ he said. ‘There would have been people who stayed away from the club and the sponsors wouldn’t have wanted to be associated with a convicted rapist and would have pulled out, and that could have compromised the survival of the club.’ Hartlepool’s statement, meanwhile, still mentioned the value of Evans as a player. It read: ‘Following media reports relating to the possible signing of Ched Evans the club wishes to make its position clear. ‘Hartlepool United do not intend signing Ched Evans and, for the avoidance of doubt, will not be doing so, irrespective of his obvious ability as a football player.

"Hartlepool United will not be signing convicted rapist Ched Evans, ‘irrespective of his obvious ability as a football player’.

"U.S. President Barack Obama delivers remarks about the launch of the Affordable Care Act's health insurance marketplaces . As many as 11 million employees of small businesses in the U.S. face paying more for health insurance under Obamacare, according to a new report into the controversial healthcare bill. The estimate, provided by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services (CMS), part of the Department of Health and Human Services, also projected that 6 million others face lower rates for health insurance. The report says that this is due to the to the laws requirement that premiums for health insurance can no longer be based on an insurance applicant's age. This means that while older people's premiums are going down, younger people's are going to rise. While the estimate is far from certain, because many small businesses renewed their insurance policies in 2013. Because they renewed before 2014, they were allowed to avoid higher premiums that went into effect, when insurance coverage was required to conform to the new law, on January 1. The estimate is also affected by the report only looking at three specific provisions of the Affordable Care Act. In actuality, employers decisions will be based on more than just three factors, according to information from the CMS. The news that premiums could increase for 11 million could be good news for the Republican party, who have made anti-Obamacare campaigning their number one priority and policy. Obamacare has been rife with problems ever since it was signed into law in March 2010. A typical U.S. insurance site, that allows citizens to sign up for medical and health insurance. Under Obamacare, the rules that exist to help them sign up are different in a way that tries to benefit those on lower incomes . Public polls suggest that the U.S. citizenship generally support Obamacare, but recent and frequent damaging mistakes and errors in its implementation have given the Republican party, who strongly oppose the legislation, ammo against it in their campaigns. Recently, errors in signing up to Obamacare using the website was fraught with error, as the site appeared to be repeatedly broken, prompting people to have to use the mobile site if they wanted to sign up. This, combined with low turnout for signing up in states such as Oregon, which signed up only 33, 808 instead of a projected 146,940, has given the public pause for thought when decided where their allegiances lie. However, despite these mistakes, many governors, both Republican and Democrats . alike, have come to the conclusion that 'Obamacare is here to stay' taking a more 'pragmatic view' of the healthcare legislation. 'We're . just trying to make the best of a bad situation' said Republican Gov. Terry Branstad of Iowa, who called the health care law 'unaffordable and . unsustainable'. Representative Cory Gardner, a Republican from Colorado, displays an advertisement from the Thanks Obamacare campaign, an anti-obamacare campaign. Republicans have been widely critical of the new healthcare legislation . He said: 'We're trying to make it work as best we can for the people of Iowa.' Governor Bobby Jindal of Louisiana said: 'I don't think that it's so deeply entrenched that it can't be repealed.' 'But I do think, as we argue for repeal, we have to show folks what you replace it with.' However, . despite a troubled introduction, nearly 3.3 million people have signed . up by February 1 for health care coverage under the law. In addition, the White House reported that 1 million people signed up nationwide for private insurance under the law in January alone. But it still remains unclear whether the administration will reach its unofficial goal of 7 million people by the end of March. 'Obamacare' is the name given to . the Patient Care and Affordable Health Act, legislation that is an . attempt to make healthcare in the U.S, which can often be very . expensive, affordable for those on lower incomes. Healthcare in the U.S. is based around the purchase of health insurance, which, before now, was able to make it expensive for people, or even deny people their services on the basis of factors like age or pre-existing medical conditions. Without medical insurance, citizens in the U.S. have to pay for their own medical care which can be incredibly expensive (a single hospital visit can cost $1,265). A few basic rules under the act are: .","11 million small business employees could pay more, 6 million pay less .
It won't affect people until next year, businesses renewed at end of 2013 .
Disparity due to law saying insurance premiums can't be based on age .
Older people will likely pay less and younger people will likely pay more .
Estimate from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services not 100 per cent ."
"A 33-year-old mother of six is fighting for her life, after prematurely giving birth to a new baby boy last week as she battles a deadly form of skin cancer. Kathy Taylor of Bear River, Utah had melanoma removed from her back seven years ago, but at the end of July the cancer came back again aggressively. At the time, she was pregnant with her sixth child with husband Nathan Taylor, and declined treatment then so that she could continue supporting her son's life. All together: Mother of six Kathy Taylor gave birth to a premature son last week, as she battles a deadly form of skin cancer. Pictured above with her husband Nathan (right) and their five oldest children, all under the age of 11 . New life: Kathy's new baby Luke is currently being nursed in an NICU incubator. He was born last week at just 1 pound and 15 ounces . 'She was doing everything in her power to hold that baby in her, so she could give him the protection and nourishment she needed to as a mommy,' mother-in-law Jocelyn Taylor told the Deseret News. However, last Thursday the pain became too much and Mrs Taylor was rushed to the hospital where she was induced and gave birth to baby Luke at just 26 weeks. Now, both mother and her 1-pound, 15-ounces son are fighting for life in the hospital. Hope: On Monday, Kathy began a new cancer treatment her family hopes will elongate her life so she can spend more time with her children . 'She’s fading,' her mother-in-law said. 'She seems to have a foot in both worlds right now.' The family is now holding onto hope that a new cancer treatment will prolong Kathy's life and give her more time with her children, especially the opportunity to hold baby Luke who is currently being nursed with an incubator in the NICU. Husband Nathan Taylor's oldest brother John  told MailOnline that some family members may be able to touch baby Luke in a few months. He will remain in the NICU until December 10. This weekend, Kathy's oldest daughter Ally turned 10, and she was able to be there for the special day by Skyping from her hospital bed. Proud mom: Kathy pictured above in family photos taken when she was pregnant with her fifth child . Her other five children have already been brought in to say goodbye to mom, according to the family's fundme page. The fund has been set up to pay for medical costs for both Kathy and her premature son. 'Ultimately we are hopeful and we are going to pray. We've received so much support from the community and everybody but ultimately I feel like it might be her time,' John Taylor told MailOnline.","Kathy Taylor, 33, was more than six months pregnant with her sixth child when she received the news that her skin cancer had returned .

"Scottish club Hibernian moved to clarify that they haven't made a bid for convicted rapist Ched Evans. The former Sheffield United striker is in fact a target for Maltese outfit Hibernians, who share a similar name to that of Alan Stubbs' side. And they are said to have offered Evans a deal for the remainder of the season. VIDEO Scroll down to see Ched Evans declare his determination to clear his name . Ex-Sheffield United striker Ched Evans is without a club after being released from prison in October . Scottish Championship side Hibernian moved to clarify they had not offered a deal to Evans . The Scottish Championship side tweeted on Friday night: 'Just to clarify, we are #Hibs of Scotland and not #Hibernians of Malta. Should that ever change we'll let you all know. 'See you the morn, HFC.' Malta's Hibernians, 15 points clear at the top of the country's domestic league having dropped just two points in 16 games, are keen, with club vice-president Stephen Vaughan saying: 'We are looking to secure the services of a top striker and Ched fits the bill. 'We've spoken to his agent and have offered a deal from now until the end of the season.' Hibernians technical director Jeffrey Farrugia told Sky Sports News he believed a deal is close. 'I think we are quite close,' he said. 'We are waiting for his agent to call.' He added on Sky News HD: 'Our vice-president has offered the contract until the end of the season to this glorious player to come over to Malta and play for our top team. We are leading the table at the moment.' Asked if he had spoken to Evans, Farrugia said: 'Me personally, no, but Mr Stephen (Vaughan) yes, he met him in the UK. They sat down with his agent so they can speak about a contract.' Evans recently released a video statement claiming his innocence alongside girlfriend Natasha Massey (right) While reports that Evans might sign with a club in England set off a storm of controversy, Farrugia believed there would be no such reaction in Malta. 'We have no problem with that,' he said. 'He was punished and he did his sentence so he should have a second chance, and our club is ready, the door is open for him to start his new career again in professional football. 'I don't think it's a wrong message. Everybody in life has mistakes, so you should have your second chance.' He added of the possibility of protests against Evans at Hibernians' stadium: 'There won't be anything of this at our club. And I can't understand sometimes how English football, English clubs, think about all these things. Everybody must have a second chance. He paid for what he did, for us it's not an issue.' Evans scored 48 goals in 113 for Sheffield United before being convicted in 2012 . Farrugia also believes that by moving to Malta, Evans can put himself in the shop window for other clubs. He said: 'For a player like him it's good to come to Malta to play these 26 games. He will be in the window for end of season, many clubs I'm sure they will go for him, so it's good for him to come here and enjoy the game of football. '(He's) a big asset for our club, (to have) the big quality of this player join our club. We need players like him in Malta.' Scottish Championship side Hibernian took to Twitter to ease fans' fears that they had made an offer to Evans, posting: 'Just to clarify we are #Hibs of Scotland and not #Hibernians of Malta. Should that ever change we'll let you all know. See you in the morn, HFC'. Evans wants to return to football after being released from prison in October. He served two-and-a-half years of a five-year sentence after being found guilty of raping a 19-year-old woman in 2011. He was initially given permission by League One Sheffield United to return to train with the club at the request of players' union, the Professional Footballers Association. But following a backlash from Blades supporters, sponsors and patrons opposed to Evans' return - 160,000 people signed a petition against it - the club retracted the offer. Tranmere chairman Mark Palios claimed the League Two club turned down an approach from associates of Evans' about the possibility of him playing for the club, before League One Oldham last month denied reports they had offered Evans the opportunity to train with the club.","Ched Evans convicted of rape in 2012 and released from prison in October .

"Some parents shopping for health insurance through the new federal marketplace are running into trouble when their children might be eligible for Medicaid but they are not. Children who qualify for Medicaid, the safety-net program for the poor and disabled, can't be included on subsidized family plans purchased through the federal marketplace, a fact that is taking many parents by surprise and causing confusion and problems for others. A California man says he was given false assurances that his children could be covered by the same plan he picked for his wife and himself, and a Florida father says his daughter is going without coverage while he waits for answers. In New Hampshire, some parents who've enrolled in private plans for themselves are finding out later that their children aren't eligible for Medicaid after all, leaving the kids with no options. Flawed: Across the country, children are being denied coverage by Obamacare, signed into law in 2010, if they qualify for Medicaid . 'The children are getting stuck in this spot where we've enrolled the parent, but we can't bring the children back on the family plan,' Maria Proulx, senior legal counsel for Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Hampshire, told a state advisory board panel this month. The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services declined to say how the system is supposed to work for families and what problems have emerged. But a regional manager for CMS acknowledged the problem at the same New Hampshire meeting and said the agency is working on it, as did Proulx in a later interview. 'This is an important issue, and we're not taking it lightly,' she said. 'Even if this impacts only one family ... it's a big deal and we want to get it resolved as quickly as possible.' The federal government sets minimum guidelines for Medicaid eligibility, but states can choose to expand coverage beyond that. In some states, parents must have significantly lower incomes to gain Medicaid coverage for themselves than they would to get coverage for just their children, either through Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program - also known as CHIP - the low-income health insurance program for children who don't qualify for Medicaid. In North Port, Fla., Russell Clouden was thrilled to find a better, cheaper family plan through the new marketplace, then stunned to realize his 14-year-old daughter wouldn't be enrolled because she might qualify for Florida Healthy Kids, the state's version of CHIP. The federal government still hasn't transferred roughly 90,000 Medicaid files over to Florida officials, including Clouden's daughter's, so she still doesn't have insurance. Denied: Jacqueline Parker relies on Medicaid, but her home state of Mississippi won't expand the program under Obamacare . 'Based on your income, they'll separate your kids from your primary policy and they shift them off to Medicaid or Healthy Kids and there's no way you can bring them back,' said Clouden, 53, who runs a restaurant franchise. His daughter is an accomplished equestrian jumper who competes around the state. 'I'm kind of in limbo with her because I'm just hoping she doesn't get injured or sick,' he said. 'Without insurance, you've kind of got a knot in your stomach watching her jumping.' Insurance broker Matthew Dinkel in Fort Myers, Fla., said he has about 15 clients in Clouden's position. 'I have worried parents literally calling and texting me every day asking for an update,' said Dinkel. 'They canceled their old plans that covered their entire family and now they have coverage but their kids don't.' Jessica Waltman of the National Association of Health Underwriters said her group has raised the problem, and others, with federal officials and asked for a dedicated hotline or email address for insurance brokers to get answers. 'It's a nationwide issue that we've heard time and again, and it could have very significant coverage issues for families,' she said. Marc Jobin, a construction consultant in southern New Hampshire, said the process has been so confusing, he's put off a decision for himself, his wife and their two children, even though he's seen premiums that are significantly lower than what they pay now. Unpopular: According to a recent poll, only 38 percent of Americans approve of Obamacare . 'We've been hesitating for two months now because the information is not clear,' he said. 'Around the holidays, we were thinking, ""let's do this, let's sign up,'"" and then the latest problem is now our children will probably be thrown into the state health care system, but nobody knows what that means.' Mary Ann Cooney, associate commissioner of the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services, urged those awaiting Medicaid decisions to call their state offices directly. She said her office has been getting incomplete application information from the federal government, making it harder to contact people to determine their Medicaid eligibility, but situations are improving and the office is reaching out to hundreds of people each day. 'There's a real light at the end of the tunnel,' she said. But in the meantime, children are going without coverage. In California, Robert Clark said when he applied by phone through the Covered California marketplace, he was assured that his two children would be on the plan he picked. But he later got separate notices from the insurance company and Medi-Cal, the state's Medicaid program. He called Covered California again and was told the person he'd previously talked to there was wrong and that his children had to be enrolled in Medi-Cal. Clark, the president of a Menlo Park technology company, doesn't like that prospect because the doctors his children have seen since their births don't take Medicaid. 'It's pretty frustrating,' he said. 'We've probably spent several days' worth of time on hold.' Instead, he's exploring whether he can enroll his children in individual, unsubsidized plans through Covered California. He recently found out his original application was ""hung up,"" so he plans to resubmit a fresh application, but in the meantime has lost out on coverage for January. 'My daughter is in gymnastics,' he said. 'If she falls on her head, we need to be covered.'","Children who qualify for Medicaid can't be included on .

"A woman who was told she had just 24 hours to live has defied the odds and returned home to her family.

Baby boy: Taylor (above with son Luke) had an aggressive form of melanoma that had spread throughout her body, but was determined to not receive treatment and carry her unborn child as long as possible . And even though the young mother could not receive treatment while pregnant, she waited as long as possible to give birth, sacrificing her life for the life of her unborn child's in the process. Ultimately, she was forced to deliver her baby prematurely, giving birth while not long after her diagnosis - at 26 weeks pregnant - due to her failing liver. Her son Luke was born on September 11, weighing just 1 pound, 15 ounces. Shortly after she delivered her baby boy, her husband and five other children were brought in to say their goodbyes, as doctors said Taylor had 24 to 36 hours to live. 'I felt really peaceful,' Taylor said. 'I thought, ""I’ve lived a really good life, a very full life. I got to be with my kids a lot."" I felt like I was going to die.' The hours somehow turned into days however, and on September 25, she was told she could go home. Emotional month: After giving birth on September 11, Taylor's condition began to slowly improve . Sad ending: Tragically, her newborn son Luke (above) passed away due to an intestinal infection on September 27 . Tragically, Luke passed away on September 27 of complications from an intestinal infection. Taylor had been diagnosed with melanoma seven years ago, and had it removed, not knowing it had returned until this summer. 'I would try to take a breath and it was like something was stabbing me,' she told KSL. After giving birth, Taylor's one wish was to be able to hold on long enough so that she could hold her son, something she was able to do on September 25, just two days before his death. On her Miracle FundMe page, set up to help pay for Luke's treatments after his birth, she wrote, 'I really believe that it was literally the thousands of prayers spoken that I am still here. I have been touched so deeply by the amazing outpouring of love from many of whom I have never met. I have seen such a profoundly deep and touching side of humanity that I will never forget. Thank you.' Making the most: Taylor (with her husband on left and Luke on right) has now been given a year to live . Doctors have now given Taylor a year to live, and she is determined to make the most of it. Or, defy the odds yet again. 'I’ll try to do everything in my power to stay, but I know it’s not in my hands, and I’m okay with that,' she said. 'Coming home and seeing how much my family loves having me here and needing me here, it just makes it harder to leave.'","Kathy Taylor, of Bear River, Utah, was discovered to have an aggressive form of melanoma in July while pregnant .

"ESPN anchor Stuart Scott has revealed his grueling treatment schedule as he battles cancer for the third time. The 48-year-old father-of-two was diagnosed with appendiceal cancer in 2007 and his appendix was removed - but the disease returned four years later and again last year. He has endured 58 infusions of chemotherapy, has undergone three abdomen surgeries and has switched to a 'fairly toxic' pill to help beat the illness - but he never wants to know quite how bad it is. 'I never ask what stage I'm in,' he told the New York Times. 'I haven't wanted to know. Fighter: ESPN anchor Stuart Scott, 48, is battling appendiceal cancer for the third time since 2007 . 'It won't change . anything to me. All I know is that it would cause more worry and a . higher degree of freakout. Stage 1, 2 or 8, it doesn't matter. I'm . trying to fight it the best I can.' Scott's sister, Susan, added that she knows the truth is 'too weighty' for her brother to hear. 'I . think he can only live with this by not even incorporating the . potential end of it,' she said. 'It doesn’t mean he doesn’t think about . it, but to let it in starts to validate it and gives it more heft.' Even though each bout of cancer has hit him harder than before, he has continued to work on 'SportsCenter' on ESPN, much to the surprise of his colleagues.

"As much as 44billion tons of nitrogen and 850billion tons of carbon could be released into the environment as permafrost thaws over the next century, U.S. government experts warn. The release of carbon and nitrogen in permafrost could make global warming much worse and threaten delicate water systems on land and offshore, according to scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey. It comes after the UN last week warned of record levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. A glacier on Bylot Island, Canada: Melting permafrosts such as these threaten to release billions of tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, accelerating climate change, a new study has warned . Billions of tonnes of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere are likely to be trapped for centuries with far-reaching impacts for all life, it was warned. But the latest figure suggests levels of carbon could double in 100 years, meaning that the increase in global temperatures will be likely to accelerate. The previously unpublished nitrogen figure is useful for scientists making predictions with computer climate models, the researchers say, while the carbon estimate adds credence to other studies with similar findings. 'This study quantifies the impact on . Earth's two most important chemical cycles, carbon and nitrogen, from . thawing of permafrost under future climate warming scenarios,' said USGS . Director Marcia McNutt. He doesn't look too worried: Mikhail Kanevsiy of the University of Alaska holds permafrost sample from about 2m depth, the likes of which USGS analysed . 'While the permafrost of the polar latitudes may seem distant and disconnected from the daily activities of most of us, its potential to alter the planet’s habitability when destabilised is very real.' To generate the estimates, scientists studied how permafrost-affected soils, known as Gelisols, thaw under various climate scenarios, reporting their findings in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. They found that all Gelisols are not alike. Some have soil materials that are very peaty, with lots of decaying organic matter that burns easily – these will impart newly thawed nitrogen into the ecosystem and atmosphere. Other Gelisols have materials that are very nutrient rich – these will release a lot of nitrogen into ecosystems. However, all Gelisols will contribute carbon dioxide and likely some methane into the atmosphere as a result of decomposition once the permafrost thaws – and these gases will contribute to global warming. Canada's extreme northern territories have been devoid of forests for millions of years. But the forests could be about to return, thanks to changing global temperatures, according to research at the University of Montreal, which suggests the freezing temperatures may mellow just enough to see the return of the ancient forests which once surrounded this icy area. Alexandre Guertin-Pasquier, of the University of Montreal's Department of Geography, presenting his findings at the Canadian Paleontology Conference in Toronto, said: 'According to the data model, climate conditions on Bylot Island will be able to support the kinds of trees we find in the fossilised forest that currently exist there, such as willow, pine and spruce. 'I've also found evidence of a possible growth of oak and hickory near the study site during this period. 'Although it would of course take time for a whole forest to regrow, the findings show that our grandchildren should be able to plant a tree and watch it grow.' 'The scientific community researching . this phenomena has made these international data available for the . upcoming Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,' said study lead . Jennifer Harden, USGS Research Soil Scientist. 'As permafrost receives more attention, we are sharing our data and our insights to guide those models as they portray how the land, atmosphere, and ocean interact.' Last week the UN's World Meteorological Organisation reported that levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere had reached 390.9 parts per million (ppm). That constitured a 40 per cent increase on the 280ppm in the atmosphere before the Industrial revolution began. Other greenhouse gases are also on the rise and are contributing to the warming caused when the trap heat that would otherwise escape into space. Methane levels rose to 1831 parts per billion which are 159 per cent higher than in pre-industrial times while nitrous oxide rose to 324.2ppb, about 20 per cent up on historical levels. The increases mean that about 30 per cent more heat was trapped in the earth’s atmosphere last year than it was in 1990. Rising carbon dioxide levels are considered to be having the most serious impact on global warming and is calculated to be responsible for 85 per cent of the extra trapped heat.",Comes after UN agency last week warned greenhouse gases in the atmosphere had reached record levels .
"On trial: Nicole Baukus is facing two charges of vehicular homicide after driving the wrong way up a Texas highway. Her trial began this week . A Texas woman who caused a deadly crash after consuming 21 drinks in four hours and driving the wrong way on a highway was sentenced to 38 years in prison Friday. In a surprise move Thursday, Nicole Baukus, 23, changed her plea to guilty and was sentenced on two counts of vehicular manslaughter homicide and one count of vehicular assault. Before entering a guilty plea, Baukus, from Spring, faced up to 60 years in prison. The wrong-way crash that took place in June 2012 on the North Freeway in Montgomery County left two teenagers dead and a third seriously injured. During the sentencing hearing Friday afternoon, jurors heard testimony from an emotional Baukus, who sobbed on the stand, saying; 'I don’t deserve to be here. I should have died in that crash also. ‘They did not deserve to die. I did. They were innocent.’ In her testimony, the 23-year-old talked about the her high school boyfriend, who died in 2007 in a DUI crash, telling the jury and members of the audience that she never wanted to put anyone through that. She also revealed to the jurors that a few months ago, she wrote a suicide note and planned to kill herself. Recalling the fateful night of June 29, 2012, Baukus said that she did not remember downing 21 shots before getting behind the wheel of her truck. She had previously claimed that she had been drugged. Change of heart: In a surprise move, Nicole Baukus, 23, changed her plea to guilty and was sentenced on two counts of vehicular manslaughter homicide and one count of vehicular assault . Emotional testimony: Baukus tearfully told the jury the unlike her, the victims were innocent and did not deserve to die in the crash . The jury also heard from the defendant's friend, who testified that he had several phone conversations with Baukus on the night of the crash, in the last of which she told him that she was on the side of the road 'throwing up on herself,' MyFox Houston reported. Just moments later, at around 3am, Baukus slammed her vehicle head on into another car, killing the driver, 19-year old Nicole Adams, and the backseat passenger, 18-year old Travis Saunders. Front seat passenger David Porras suffered severe injuries but pulled through. A toxicology test determined that the 23-year-old had a blood alcohol level four times the legal limit. She also had marijuana and Valium in her system, and police found a glass drug pipe in her car. In his closing arguments, prosecutors Warren Diepraam and Andrew James called Baukus an 'overindulgent party girl' and a sometimes 'drug dealer.'

""The best thing for this community is to get her out of it.  Keep her out of it as long as possible.  When you do what she did you won't get to go home,’ James told the jury. The station KAKE reported that Baukus’ father took the stand before the jury began deliberations, talking about his own problems with alcohol and about his daughter, at one point saying, ‘I'm just happy she's alive. She should be dead too and I can't imagine how the victims' families feel.’ Fred Sanders, the father of crash victim Travis Sanders, sat through all the testimony and said he does not believe Baukus was truly remorseful for her actions. ‘I didn't think it was for us. I didn't think it was for our kids, those three innocent kids. That wasn't for them; that was for the jury. It was for her cause she's afraid she's going to jail,’ he told the TV station Click2Houston.

"The flagship Obamacare website continued to spout error messages on Monday, hobbling a new fix that the White House bragged would avoid system crashes caused by too much Web traffic. Frustrated with news reports about crashes, delays and other online failures, the Obama administration's 'tech surge' team put in place an email-driven 'queuing system' similar to the overdraft feature available with some checking accounts. When the site's traffic exceeds its capacity, subsequent users see a message asking for their email addresses. 'Can't wait?' the message reads. 'Leave your email with us, and we'll send you a one-time message when HealthCare.gov is ready for you to return.' This page, too, was prone to crash on Monday, at the very moment White House Press Secretary Jay Carney was boasting about it to reporters. Scroll down for video . Uh-oh: While the federal government touts upgrades to the Obamacare website, consumers are seeing a new raft of error messages -- even when they choose to enter a virtual waiting room for enrollment . MailOnline provided healthcare.gov with six different email addresses from six different locations in New York City and Washington, D.C. In five cases, a new error message appeared. 'Sorry, there was an error!' it read. 'Please reload and try again later.' The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said Monday during a conference call with reporters that the queueing system was put in place at 10:00 Monday morning. During his daily press briefing on Monday, Carney cautioned reporters to draw a distinction between error messages and the queueing system – which he styled as a life-saving feature, not a bug unto itself. Americans, said Fox News correspondent Ed Henry, 'are still getting the same error messages they got three weeks ago.' Not so, said Carney. 'I think you're confusing error messages with the queueing message, which is quite a different thing entirely,' he claimed. 'The queuing system,' Carney had said earlier in the briefing, 'is a feature designed to improve the user experience.' White House press secretary Jay Carney insisted that the 'queueing feature' -- a sort of overdraft protection for website registrations -- was a helpful new feature, but it crashed whiel he was praising its virtues . He told reporters that through 12:00 noon, healthcare.gov had been visited 375,000 times since midnight Monday. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has said that it hoped to have the capacity to serve as many as 800,000 visitors per day. Only a fraction of those visitors are expected to create healthcare.gov accounts, apply for coverage, or actually purchase insurance policies. Carney's remarks, and the latest round of website failures, came on Cyber Monday, an unofficial shopping holiday when Amazon.com expected to sell 27 million items to 13 million customers. He also reinforced the White House's earlier promises, going back to early in 2010, that President Obama himself would sign up for Affordable Care Act coverage. 'He will,' Carney confirmed. The move would be largely symbolic, however, since a private staff of military doctors cares for the Obama family.","Government programmers designed a 'queueing' feature to help avoid system crashes, emailing users to return when traffic levels are lower .

"Health insurance companies are crying foul over new measures President Obama announced Thursday as a political tweak to his fast-disintegrating Affordable Care Act, making the fix potentially worse than the problem. But Republicans are set to up the ante even further with a vote Friday that could push insurers to honor or reissue policies ripe for cancellation under Obamacare for the long haul, instead of merely giving them the option for one year. The White House said Thursday that the president would veto the bill, but it's unclear whether he will have the political will to do so when the time comes. The president declared that insurance companies could allow Americans to keep their health insurance plans without paying for costly upgrades that satisfy the Obamacare law's stringent requirements. Meanwhile, state insurance commissioners joined a conference call to carp about what it will mean for their industry, and whether Obama's latest pivot will make things even worse. 'This whole thing – it's a mess,' an . insurance company official told MailOnline, speaking on background. 'With six weeks left before New Year's, I don't know how the White House . expects us to fix what's already happened.' Obama 'kind of threw us under the bus today,' one of the regulators told The New York Times. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . President Obama told an approving crowd in Cleveland Ohio on Thursday that he would 'see this through,' but his latest proposal might not be legal unless Congress acts . NBC White House Correspondent Chuck Todd said Friday that Obama doesn't have the legal authority to 'fix' Obamacare without help from Congress . The president will meet with a group of insurance company CEOs on Friday to persuade them that his plan is feasible, but he can't force them to reissue plans that they've already cancelled. Obama's new strategy is more political than practical, designed to discourage Democrats who face tough re-election battles from defecting to support the GOP's plan. 'There . is no doubt that our failure to roll out the [Affordable Care Act] smoothly has put a . burden on Democrats, whether they're running or not,' he said Thursday, 'because they stood . up and supported this effort through thick and thin. And, you know, I feel deeply responsible for making it harder for . them.' Whether or not House Republicans win over Democrats on Friday, they will almost certainly pass the bill offered by Michigan Rep. Fred Upton. The resulting stalemate will put pressure back on the president, who lacks the legal authority to change the law without intervention from Congress. 'The president’s ""administrative fix"" is an attempt to create a lifeboat for ObamaCare to get his party through the 2014-midterm elections,' said South Carolina Republican Rep. Jeff Duncan. 'The president’s actions appear to be unconstitutional.' 'He didn't really fix anything' on Thursday,' NBC White House Correspondent Chuck Todd said Friday morning, 'There's nothing that was fixed, because he doesn't have the power to do it.' Obamacare victim: Shonn Hild of Sullivan, Illinois and his family recently received notice from his insurance company that the health policy covering his two children would be canceled . Millions of Americans have lost their individual health insurance plans since the Affordable Care Act became law, and a website called mycancellation.com is publishing the bad-news letters . Obama's new plan, the insurance . companies fret, won't magically fix things for the estimated 5 million . people who are already affected. And some in the industry believe that Obama is setting them up to be the fall guys if the latest flavor-of-the-month tweak to Obamacare sours. 'What we want to do,' the president said Thursday at the White House, 'is to be able to say to these folks, ""you know what, the Affordable Care Act is not going to be the reason why insurers have to cancel your plan.”' The real reason may end up being laws at the state level that govern the insurance market. CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, a large insurer in Maryland and the District of Columbia, said in a statement that 'we are strictly bound by state laws.' 'At the moment,' the insurer said, 'it is unclear whether state laws would preclude us from doing what the president has proposed.' Worse, prices could go up if they managed to do Obama's bidding. Michigan GOP Rep. Fred Upton (L) congratulated the president on Thursday for signing a bill rewarding schools that stockpile a medication that can save children's lives after an allergy attack. But the prickly Republican will square off against the White House in a Friday Obamacare vote . 'Changing the rules after health plans have already met the requirements of the law could destabilize the market and result in higher premiums for consumers,' America's Health Insurance Plans president Karen Ignagni warned on Friday. 'Premiums have already been set for next year based on an assumption of when consumers will be transitioning to the new [federal] marketplace.' Young people who have insurance and have received cancellation letters will likely stay out of the system if they can. They're the healthiest Americans whom the White House needs to sign up in order to balance Obamacare's books. They're also the most likely to have budget-minded insurance policies that don't meet Obamacare's strict requirements. 'If due to these changes fewer younger . and healthier people choose to purchase coverage in the exchange, . premiums will increase in the marketplace and there will be fewer . choices for consumers,' Ignagni predicted. 'Fewer healthy people and younger people would be leaving their current plans,' health insurance actuary Jim O'Connor, told The Wall Street Journal. 'The exchanges are likely to be left with a less healthy distribution than they otherwise would have been.' House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio slammed the Affordable Care Act on Thursday, insisting it's time to 'scrap this law once and for all' Louisiana insurance commissioner Jim Donelon, who serves as president of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, said in a statement that 'it is unclear how, as a practical matter, the changes proposed today by the president can be put into effect.' 'In many states, cancellation notices have already gone out to policyholders and rates and plans have already been approved for 2014. Changing the rules through administrative action at this late date creates uncertainty and may not address the underlying issues.' Washington state insurance commissioner Mike Kreidler said Thursday that he has 'serious concerns about how President Obama's proposal would be implemented and more significantly, its potential impact on the overall stability of our health insurance market.'","Insurance companies have spent years preparing for Obamacare and now think Obama 'threw us under the bus'

The White House says Obama will veto the 'Keep Your Health Plan Act'"
"Americans will pay an average premium of $328 monthly for a mid-tier health insurance plan when the Obamacare health exchanges open for enrollment next week, and most will qualify for government subsidies to lower that price, the Obama administration said on Wednesday. The figure, based on data for approved insurance plans in 48 states, represents the broadest national estimate for how much Americans will pay for health coverage under President Barack Obama's healthcare reform law next year. The prices of the new plans are at the heart of a political debate over whether they will be affordable enough to attract millions of uninsured Americans. President Barack Obama, right, waves to members of the audience after speaking at the Clinton Global Initiative with former President Bill Clinton, left, in New York, Tuesday . By comparison, the Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that the average monthly premiums in the individual market in 2010 were $215 per person. Prices were lower in states with more competition among insurers and higher in states with fewer players, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said in its report. Americans will be able to sign up for the new plans via online state exchanges beginning on October 1. 'For millions of Americans these new options will finally make health insurance work within their budgets,' HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said during a briefing with reporters. The Obama administration is counting on signing up 7 million Americans in the first full year of reform through the state exchanges, including 2.7 million younger and healthier consumers who are needed to offset the costs of sicker members. Debate over whether Obamacare will prove affordable for millions of uninsured Americans has been sharp during the past few months, as states have announced rates. States that have supported the law said it will lead to lower prices. Others that have opposed the reform - including Georgia, Florida, and Indiana - warned of 'rate shock' for consumers compared to what they could buy on the individual insurance market a year ago. Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton introduces President Barack Obama and former president Bill Clinton for a conversation about the future of health care reform in America . HHS said the average price was 16 percent lower than its own projections on premiums. In addition, consumers who earn up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level, or $62,040 for a couple, will qualify for subsidies that will lower the price further. TEXAS RATES BELOW AVERAGE . The data is mostly based on 36 states where the federal government will operate the insurance exchange. About 14 other states and the District of Columbia are running their own exchange. Politics aside, states with the lowest average premium tend to have more insurance companies offering plans, the report said. It said eight issuers on average were selling plans in the states with average premiums in the lowest 25 percent, while states with average premiums in the top 25 percent had only three insurers on average. Texas has been among the Republican-led states most fiercely opposed to Obamacare, but its monthly rates came in below the national average, HHS said. In Austin, Texas, with 76 plans to choose from, a 27-year-old would pay $169 per month for the lowest cost mid-tier plan. In Dallas-Fort Worth, with 43 plans to choose from, that price was $217 per month, the report said. 'The rates in Texas are looking good,' said Gary Cohen, who is charged with overseeing the exchanges at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Enrolling enough consumers is key to making the healthcare overhaul work economically, with price considered the most important factor driving enrollment, according to insurance industry surveys. Another concern has been that insurance companies will limit access to doctors in order to keep prices low. Cohen said that these so-called 'narrow networks' were a trend before the Affordable Care Act went into effect. The law was adopted in 2010 but two of its main pillars, the health exchanges and the expansion of Medicaid, take effect in 2014. Household names like UnitedHealth Group Inc, Aetna Inc, WellPoint Inc and Humana Inc will sell plans on at least some exchanges. Newcomers such as Medicaid specialist Molina Healthcare Inc will also play a role.","Data was reported by the Obama adminsitration .

"Thirty years after British forces liberated the Falkland Islands from Argentinian invaders, the two countries are still at odds over who has the more legitimate claim to the land. But it seems the inhabitants of the island would prefer to be left to their own devices, with just one in three saying they actually feel British. A census in the self-governing British Overseas Territory found that an overwhelming 59 percent say their national identity is 'Falkland Islander'. Just 29 per cent admit feeling 'British'. More than half of inhabitants of the Falklands consider themselves 'Falkland Islanders' rather than 'British' The census results have implications for Argentina, which refuses to deal directly with the Falkland Islands' local government and accuses Britain of running what Argentines call the Islas Malvinas as an illegal colony. The survey also puts the average annual income at $32,213 (£20,015), much higher than Argentina's $9,620 (£5,977) as of last year, or that of the Falklands' other Latin American neighbors. The income figure underlines how much things have changed since before the 1982 war. Back then, wool prices had bottomed out internationally and invading Argentine soldiers were told they would be welcomed by impoverished and oppressed tenant farmers. Instead, they encountered a stubbornly defiant population that helped British troops retake the islands. Sheltered by continued military support, Falklanders have seen their livelihoods greatly improve since the war, with revenue flowing in from fisheries, tourism and offshore oil development. But the census also reveals a problem: The islands' population hasn't grown since the last survey was done in 2006. There are only 2,563 residents after civilian contractors and British military personnel and their dependents are excluded. The population is aging rapidly, too, with the ranks of people older than 65 increasing by 14 percent in the last six years. 'If the Falklands is to progress we need to increase our population,' said Les Harris, a 73-year-old retired power station manager who was born in Chile. Liberation: The Union flag is hoisted over Port Howard, West Falkland, for the first time in more than two months by 40 Commando, Royal Marine signifying the end of the Falklands conflict . Claim: Royal Marines go ashore in the Falklands during the height of the conflict in May 1982 . The census shows unemployment at just 1 percent, with one-fifth of all workers having multiple jobs. The largest employer by far is the government, at 28 percent, followed by agriculture (11 percent) and hospitality and tourism (11 percent). Offshore oil and gas development could bring sudden wealth to the islands if several drilling efforts strike it rich. But the effort currently employs just 26 islanders, and there simply aren't enough people around to work the jobs created by a growing economy. 'There is virtually no spare capacity within the labor market to accommodate any additional employment opportunities that may arise in the future. Indeed, almost 20 percent of persons in employment have more than one job,' the government said Tuesday. The census shows immigration slowing, due to one of the world's most restrictive policies: Newcomers aren't allowed to apply for islander status, giving them voting rights among other things, until they have completed seven years of residency. That can be done only by repeatedly renewing temporary labor contracts. Even then, only 40 people can apply each year, and not all are accepted. The census says 70 per cent of the population, 1,973 people, are Falkland Islanders or Falkland Island Status Holders.","Over half of islanders call themselves 'Falklands Islanders' rather than 'British'

"A new kind of ‘Godzilla’ planet - so-called because of its huge size - has been discovered 560 light years from Earth, raising hopes of finding rocky worlds that could sustain life. Named Kepler-10c, the planet is 17 times more massive than our planet, and has been named a 'mega-Earth'. Astronomers didn't believe such a world could exist because they argued anything so large would grab hydrogen gas as it grew and become a gaseous ‘mini-Neptune’. A new kind of ‘Godzilla’ planet - dubbed a mega-Earth - has been discovered in a distant star system. Pictured is an artist's impression of the newly discovered planet, which dominates the foreground. Its sibling, the lava world Kepler-10b, is in the background . But to their surprise, Kepler-10c has been able to remain solid despite being more than twice as old as the Earth. The discovery suggests that potentially life-bearing rocky planets may be far more common than first thought, and some could be extremely ancient. Kepler-10c circles its sun-like parent star, located in the constellation Draco, every 45 days. The planet has a diameter more than twice that of the Earth. The Kepler-10 star system is thought to be 11 billion years old, meaning it formed less than three billion years after the birth to the universe. It is located about 560 light-years from Earth in the constellation Draco. The heavyweight world is up to 17 times more massive than the Earth, . It has at least one unusual neighbour, Kepler-10b - a scorching hot 'lava world' three times heavier than Earth that whips around the star once every 20 hours. Kepler- 10c isn’t likely to harbour life as it is too close to its parents star. Gravity at the surface is about twice that of Earth’s gravity. The Kepler-10 star system is thought to be 11 billion years old, meaning it formed less than three billion years after the birth to the universe. Earth, by comparison, is only around 4.5 billion years old. ‘This is the Godzilla of Earths. But unlike the movie monster, Kepler-10c has positive implications for life,’ said Dr Dimitar Sasselov, from the Harvard Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics (CFA). ‘Finding Kepler-10c tells us that rocky planets could form much earlier than we thought. And if you can make rocks, you can make life.' Kepler- 10c isn’t likely to harbour life as it is too close to its parents star. Gravity at the surface is about twice that of Earth’s gravity.

The Kepler space telescope orbits around the sun, 40 million miles from Earth. It is named after 17th Century astronomer Johannes Kepler. The probe launched in 2009 with the mission of finding new planets. Kepler's mission was supposed to be over by now, but last year Nasa agreed to keep Kepler running through 2016 at a cost of about £13 million ($20 million) a year. According to Nasa, there is, what's dubbed, a 'Goldilocks Zone' in space where the temperature is not too hot, or too cold, for water to exist in liquid form. Any planets found in this zone could have life on them. If Kepler is retired, Nasa scientists believe the search for other lives on planets could be severely hindered. Kepler- 10c was originally spotted by Nasa's Kepler spacecraft, which finds planets using the transit method, looking for a star that dims when a planet passes in front of it. By measuring the dimming, scientists can calculate the planet’s physical size. The planet was originally spotted by Nasa's Kepler spacecraft, which finds planets using the transit method - looking for a star that dims when a planet passes in front of it. By measuring the amount of dimming, astronomers can calculate the planet’s physical size. Kepler-10c, which has a diameter more than twice that of the Earth, was previously thought to fall into the category of 'mini-Neptune' planets that have an icy core surrounded by a thick gassy envelope. But observations made from the Italian Galileo National Telescope in the Canary Islands confirmed that it has 17 times the mass of the Earth - far heavier than expected. This proved it must be made from dense rocks, like the Earth. 'We were very surprised when we realised what we had found,' said astronomer Dr Xavier Dumusque, also from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who led the research. 'Kepler-10c didn’t lose its atmosphere over time. It’s massive enough to have held onto one if it ever had it - it must have formed the way we see it now.' CFA astronomer Lars Buchhave believe he has found a correlation between the period of a planet - how long it takes to orbit its star - and the size at which a planet transitions from rocky to gaseous. This suggests that more mega-Earths will be found as planet hunters extend their data to longer-period orbits. Kepler- 10c was originally spotted by Nasa's Kepler spacecraft (artist's impression pictured), which finds planets using the transit method, looking for a star that dims when a planet passes in front of it. By measuring the dimming, scientists can calculate the planet’s physical size . The early universe contained only hydrogen and helium. Heavier elements needed to make rocky planets, such as silicon and iron, had to be created in the first generations of stars. When those stars exploded, they scattered the crucial ingredients through space, which then could be incorporated into later generations of stars and planets. The process should have taken billions of years, but Kepler-10c shows that the universe was able to form such huge rocks even during the time when heavy elements were scarce. Professor Sasselov said astronomers should not rule out old stars when they search for Earth-like planets. And if old stars can host rocky Earths too, he said, then we have a better chance of locating potentially habitable worlds in our cosmic neighborhood.","The 11 billion-year-old planet is located 560 light years away from Earth .

"Manuel Pellegrini believes it is inevitable that Manchester City will win the Champions League but warns that his club must compete for club football’s biggest prize on an annual basis if they are to be considered among Europe’s great teams. The City manager, preparing for Tuesday’s home group meeting with Roma at the Etihad Stadium, is convinced that it is only a matter of time before the multi millions invested by the clubs Arab ownership reap the ultimate reward. But Pellegrini, who performed minor miracles in Champions League campaigns at unfashionable Spanish sides Malaga and Villarreal, knows that is only the beginning of the challenge facing City. Manuel Pellegrini believes that Manchester City will win the Champions League in the near future . Pellegrini's title in his debut Premier League season has made him a much-loved figure in Manchester . And having set his side a minimum target of a place in the last eight of this season’s competition - one round better than 12 months ago - Pellegrini has outlined the requirement for his club moving forward. 'I am absolutely sure we will do it. It’s very important to win the Champions League. We hope we will win it this year,' said Pellegrini. 'But suppose we do. After that it will be finished. It’s a good achievement but then you must do it every year. Sometimes it will be the final, sometimes the semi-final. How many Champions League do Man United have? Two when Alex Ferguson had his project. 'Winning the Champions League is one of the projects but we must also continue winning Premier League titles and FA Cups and to arrive in the semi-finals and not to be eliminated at the group stage.' Joe Hart could not save Jerome Boateng's last minute strike that saw City defeated by Bayern Munich . City have tended to struggle in the latter stages of the Champions League and in their groups . Pellegrini wants his charges to pick up more Premier League titles but knows they need to impact on Europe . Pellegrini, having led City to the Premier League title and Capital One Cup in his debut season in English football, has set high standards since replacing Roberto Mancini. But the Chilean is painfully aware that domestic success is only half the story if his club want to be considered in the same breath as current group rivals Bayern Munich and other European heavyweights. 'If you want to be a really big team you must be involved in both competitions – Europe and in England - and to be a strong team, not only to be comfortable with winning just once,' he said. 'Our target is to be successful in the Champions League and the Premier League, both. Real Madrid or Barcelona or Bayern Munich or the teams playing in other leagues, if they are not involved in one of the competitions it is not good for them. 'They must always be fighting for the domestic title and also in Europe. That is what this club must need to do in the future and it is one of our targets.' Stevan Jovetic and Samir Nasri will be missing for City against Roma, along with Fernando . Despite his frank analysis of the situation, Pellegrini is also conscious of not placing himself under too much pressure by guaranteeing success this season, especially given the club’s modest efforts in even qualifying from group play in past seasons. 'It’s not the death of the club if we cannot do it this year,' he said. 'We must be very patient. The most important thing is that we are growing in all senses, not just trying to win titles.' Pellegrini expects to be without the injured Fernando, Stevan Jovetic and Samir Nasri on Tuesday but the tie offers one intriguing potential reunion - that of City loanee Frank Lampard and his former Chelsea and England team mate Ashley Cole, who has since joined the Italian club. Ashley Cole and Frank Lampard, both formerly of Chelsea, could be reunited on the Etihad pitch on Tuesday .","Manuel Pellegrini predicts that his side will win Europe's top competition .

"Joe Hart was more than happy to let Manuel Pellegrini do the talking on Monday when it came to questions about the England goalkeeper waiting for a new contract offer from Manchester City. On the issue of being rested for the last two games, however, Hart was more vocal. He does not like it and will probably never appreciate the positives of having a breather. At least not until he is long retired. This was hardly on the same scale of rebellion as Phil Mickelson with Tom Watson, but it was an awkward moment as Hart sat beside his manager to discuss Tuesday night’s Champions League clash with Roma at the Etihad Stadium. Manuel Pellegrini has restored Joe Hart to his starting XI for Tuesday night's clash with Roma . Joe Hart will get another chance to impress Manuel Pellegrini as he battles for the No 1 spot . Even at this early stage of the campaign, the tie has a make-or-break feel to it after City’s defeat by Bayern Munich in their opening Group E match and the Italians’ 5-1 win over CSKA Moscow. Another defeat for the Premier League champions would seriously damage their hopes of reaching the knockout phase. Pellegrini is taking no chances and will recall Hart in place of Willy Caballero, who played against Sheffield Wednesday and Hull City. Hart, England’s No 1, could have talked up the benefits of having a rest or extolled the virtues of squad rotation. He did neither. Joe Hart is not happy with bench duty after watching the wins against Sheffield Wednesday and Hull City . ‘I want to play every game, that is my nature, my professionalism,’ he said. ‘I am not the manager, just a player. I live by the decisions of the manager.’ Pellegrini sat impassively as Hart continued: ‘We’ve always had good goalkeepers since I’ve been here going back to David James, (Andreas) Isaksson, Kasper (Schmeichel), Shay Given, (Costel) Pantilimon and Stuart Taylor. ‘It has always been a fight for me to keep my place. I’ve got high standards that I like to keep to, whether I’m the only goalkeeper or one of 20. It excites me. I love challenging for my place and I love playing and that will never change. I will continue fighting.’ But can Hart at least see the benefits of taking a back seat? Joe Hart will be hoping to replicate his display against Bayern Munich in the last group game . He might be Roma’s most iconic player, but Francesco Totti he has never won a game or even scored in his nine visits to England. Roma have lost their last three games in Manchester. They lost 1-0 twice and were smashed 7-1 in the quarter finals in 2007, all at Old Trafford. Sergio Aguero enjoys playing at home in the Champions League. He has five goals in his last five home games. It took him 10 games to reach the same total in the league. Roma have not kept a clean sheet in their last nine games in the Champions League, letting in on average two goals in each. ‘It’s hard for me to see it that way,’ he said. ‘I’m sure that when I retire I’ll see them but right now I’m not going to see positives.’ That is unlikely to bother Pellegrini. Hart was dropped for seven league games last season and bringing in £6million Caballero in the summer was designed to put more pressure on him. Further doubts were raised over Hart’s place earlier this month but a magnificent performance in Munich helped end that particular debate, even though he was beaten by a 90th-minute winner from former City defender Jerome Boateng. It’s worth noting that former city defender Maicon is back in town on Tuesday night, as is Ashley Cole. Hart was asked if he would ever consider following Cole, his former England team-mate, to Serie A. City’s Micah Richards also moved to Italy in the summer, joining Fiorentina. Joe Hart sees no positives in being rested and is keen to play every game . Ashley Cole was 'brave' to move to Italy, according to former England teammate Joe Hart . City have lost three CL games in a row, their worst run in Europe. Roma hit five past CSKA Moscow on matchday one — their biggest win in European competition. City have only won two of their eight games against Italian opposition. Both wins came more than 35 years ago. Roma were the pass masters on matchday one. The three top passers all played for the Italians. ‘Ash was brave to make the move,’ said Hart. ‘I’ve got a lot of respect for the boys who have done it. Micah seems to be loving it out there but right now I’m happy with what’s going on at this club. While I am welcome here, I am more than happy to stay and see where that takes me.’ City have given new contracts to a number of key players in recent months, but Hart is still waiting even though club insiders insist one will be forthcoming. He let Pellegrini field that awkward question on Monday. ‘Me and Joe know what’s happening with that issue,’ said the City manager, who will be back in the dugout after a two-game touchline ban. ‘But it’s not the most important thing at this moment. We are thinking about Roma.’ Joe Hart admits City need to get off the mark following defeat in Munich last time out . City certainly cannot afford to underestimate their opponents even though the Italians have won only once in 14 attempts on English soil. That includes three defeats by Manchester United — most memorably a 7-1 thrashing in the quarter-finals in 2007. However, Rudi Garcia’s side have a 100 per cent record this season, winning all five Serie A games as well as that convincing victory over CSKA. Only two goals have been conceded. ‘It’s obviously a big game after a disappointing start in Munich,’ said Hart. ‘Luckily it’s not the knockout phase straightaway. ‘We’ve always had tough groups in our brief Champions League history. They are big nights and we all understand you have to do well at home. ‘But we’ve shown that we can play with the big boys. We just need to finish the game off.’","Hart will start for City in Tuesday night's meeting with Roma at the Etihad .

"To date the most populated planetary system that we know of is that around the sun-like star HD 10180, which is thought to have nine planets in total. The planets, however, are inhospitable to life as we know it, ranging from hot super-Earths to gas giants bigger than Neptune. But could there exist a system with many, many more planets than this – with dozens of them habitable? That’s what one astronomer has calculated, and he says it’s theoretically possible a system could exist with 60 worlds life could exist on. Astronomer Dr Sean Raymond has devised an 'ultimate solar system' (shown) that could have as many as 60 habitable worlds. To create the theoretical model he considered the stars, planets and orbits that would be required to allow as many Earth-like worlds as possible to exist . Dr Sean Raymond, an astronomer at the Laboratoire d’Astrophysique de Bordeaux in Bordeaux, France has revealed how to build a so-called ‘ultimate solar system’ at PlanetPlanet. His self-appointed task was to build a planetary system with the most habitable worlds possible that could survive for billions of years. To do so he considered the kind of star that would be needed, the types of planets and the logistics of the orbits. ‘With the ultimate Solar System I wanted to come up with a fun idea to get people thinking about this stuff,’ Raymond tells MailOnline in an email. ‘And everyone is interested in astronomy and planets so it's a fun way to use your imagination. ‘I don't claim to have the absolute best answer.  Still, with just these relatively simple pieces it's easy to build a very rich system!’ In choosing a star Raymond opted for one about half the size and mass of the sun at the hotter end of the ‘red dwarf’ spectrum. This, he says, would create a system that will survive longer than our own with a fairly tight habitable zone, the area around a star within which it is neither too hot nor too cold for water, and possibly life, to form. Next he considered what types of planets would create the most hospitable environments in a packed planetary system. ‘We want planets that are not too small, big, dry or wet,’ he writes. ‘We want planets with atmospheres, surfaces, oceans and continents. ‘This translates to worlds between about half and twice the size of Earth, with between ten times less and ten times more water than Earth.’ The first of the two planetary systems that would fit into Raymond's final design would have 24 habitable worlds. These would each be binary Earths in trojan orbits (ones that trail another) around their central star, a red dwarf smaller and slightly less hot than the sun . To date Nasa has found many potentially habitable worlds outside the solar system, but most have been so-called super-Earths that are much larger than our own world. The habitability of these planets is not well understood but, if they reside in the habitable zone of their host star, it is possible they could have liquid water . The Goldilocks zone, or habitable zone, is the belt around a star where temperatures are ideal . for liquid water to . pool on a planet's surface. To determine the location of a star's habitable zone, scientists have to first learn how much total radiation it emits. They can calculate this by knowing the size and type of the star. They can then estimate a region where it might not be too hot or too cold for water to form. The final step was to find suitable orbits for the planets to inhabit. Raymond says there are two possible configurations for a solar system packed with habitable planets. This first is one that includes multiple binary planets, two Earth-sized planets orbiting one another as they orbit their sun. Within the habitable zone of the star specified earlier, Raymond envisages six orbital bands, with two binary planet systems per orbit. Each pair of systems would be known as a ‘trojan’ pair, which means one trails the other in the orbit. In our solar system there are what are known as trojan asteroids, which trail the orbit of Jupiter. In total this system would therefore have 24 habitable worlds. Some of these worlds would have different amounts of water and different sizes to each other but Raymond says they would all be habitable. In the second configuration he considers a system that not only has binary planets, but gas giant planets with Earth-sized moons in orbit as well. This is similar to our own solar system, where Jupiter has four large moons approaching the size of Earth and Saturn has one. In such a system, to remain gravitationally stable, there would be four orbital bands. On each would be two binary systems and one gas giant with five Earth-sized moons in orbit, again with trojan orbits. This system would have a grand total of 36 habitable worlds. The other component system of Raymond's ultimate solar system would have, in addition to binary planets, four gas giants each with five Earth-sized moons in orbit. In this model Raymond says there would be a total of 36 habitable worlds which, when combined with the other system, gives a total of 60 . The discovery of Kepler-186f, the first Earth-sized world to be found orbiting in the habitable zone of a star, was announced back in April. This world is the best bet so far for a planet that could not only support water on its surface but life as well in some form . Raymond then says that if the two systems were in a binary star system separate by about 100 AU (100 times the Earth-sun distance), it would create the ultimate solar system with 60 habitable planets. ‘The ultimate solar system is scientifically valid,’ Raymond continues to MailOnline. ‘Each piece has either been directly observed or has been inferred from theoretical work. ‘For example, the Earth-moon and Pluto-Charon systems are planets with nearly equal-sized moons. ‘We know of plenty of planets in the habitable zones of their host stars. ‘And computer simulations tell us that trojan configurations might be common in planetary systems, and that large moons may form readily around giant planets (although exactly how large is debated). But, Raymond concedes, the chances of such a system are slim, although not non-existant. ‘Packing so many habitable worlds into one system may be a bit of a stretch. ‘Having all of these pieces in the same system in the right combination is probably not all that common.’ He also says there could be theoretical systems with more than 60 habitable worlds, but for now his model is the most scientifically viable.","Dr Sean Raymond has unveiled his theoretical model of a planetary system .
And he says it is possible a solar system could have up to 60 Earths .

Such a system is not likely to be common but could exist, says Raymond ."

"Three months into his new life in Rome and the most memorable contribution from Ashley Cole remains that peculiar pose on the fringes of a group photograph. It proved an internet hit and Cole took the jokes in good spirit but the snapshot seems to have captured accurately a footballer with peripheral role in the squad, unable to mix with his new colleagues as he gets to grips with the language. The former Chelsea and Arsenal defender is slowly learning some Italian, but it is a new trick for a 33-year-old and he is naturally more comfortable in the company of Roma team-mates who speak good English such as Daniele de Rossi, Miralem Pjanic and Kevin Strootman. Ashley Cole looked to be distant from his team-mates during a Roma team photo . Cole has failed to replicate the high standards he had previously shown in the Premier League . Daniele de Rossi (left) and Kevin Strootman (right) are among Cole's closest friends at Roma . The 33-year-old has played four league games for Roma since joining the club on a free transfer . On the pitch, he has not dazzled. Reporters who cover the Giallorosso have rated him with fives and sixes in his opening games and compared him unfavourably to Maicon, who arrived 12 months earlier at the age of 32 and, after initial concerns, proved to be an inspired acquisition. Ashley Cole's appearances for Roma so far: . Roma 2-0 Hellas Verona . Roma 2-0 Cagliari . Empoli 0-1 Roma . Roma 2-0 Fiorentina . For Roma, however, the season could not have started better. The Giallorosso have won their first six in all competitions. They trail champions Juventus at the top of Serie A only on goal difference and smashed five past CSKA Moscow in their Champions League opener. Cole was left out against CSKA, as versatile Greek Vasilis Torosidis, who normally plays on the right, was switched to left back to mark Zoran Tosic. Former Premier League star Cole was also an unused substitute for the game against Parma, but has since returned to the team and played 90 minutes at the weekend in the win against Verona. 'Team work makes the dream work,' tweeted Cole, after helping Roma make it 15 points from five games in Serie A. If there is one thing he really does know about it is winning. Thirteen major trophies in England tells you that. Cole arrived at Manchester Airport on Monday morning ahead of his side's Champions League encounter . The former Arsenal and Chelsea ace will know all about facing Premier League champions Manchester City . Roma will look to utilise Cole's experience of playing against Champions League opponents City . Cole went on Twitter on Sunday to reveal his delight at Roma's 2-0 win against Verona . Boss Rudi Garcia is convinced the Londoner will adjust to Italian football. The tempo is slower than the Premier League, which should offset his age (Francesco Totti is still starring at 38), and Cole has more Champions League experience than any other player in the Roma squad. When asked how he has fit in, Garcia has said Cole is 'quiet' and 'polite' and working hard, determined to make the move a success. A career in Rome is not built in a day, after all. Cole’s attitude to training has never been questioned, even if he has annoyed managers like Carlo Ancelotti and Jose Mourinho at times with his fondness for night-life. He has yet to find his way into Italy’s gossip columns. Among team-mates, he has always been popular and it has been quite some time since he was an eye-catching, flying full back. In his Chelsea years, he was more of a solid and reliable performer, low on errors, leaning on his nous and ability to read the game while rarely doing anything flash (at least not on the pitch) and never letting his team-mates down. Occasionally he would produce a barely-believable clearance as a reminder of his individual quality. This is what made him the best English left back of his generation and earned him more than 100 international caps. It is a little surprising, therefore, that the Italian media have been unimpressed with his defensive acumen, while satisfied with his ability to get forward and deliver a cross. Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho decided it was time to move Cole on at the end of last season . Cole said an emotional farewell to the Stamford Bridge faithful after leaving the club in the summer . The former England full back represented his country 107 times before announcing his international retirement in May 2014 . OCTOBER 2013: Chelsea 2-1 Manchester City (Premier League) W . FEBRUARY 2013: Manchester 2-0 Chelsea (Premier League) L . NOVEMBER 2012: Chelsea 0-0 Manchester City (Premier League) D . AUGUST 2012: Chelsea 2-3 Manchester City (Community Shield) L . MARCH 2012: Manchester City 2-1 Chelsea (Premier League) L . DECEMBER 2011: Chelsea 2-1 Manchester City (Premier League) W . Cole knows how to defend. This is something he will crack when he understands the details of Italian football and can communicate more effectively. His mature defensive profile fits with the traditional image of a full back in the Italian game. They are in the team primarily to defend, although modern coaches demand a little more mileage and creative input from their full backs. Cole’s advancing years – he will be 34 in December - and his battle-scarred ankles may be limiting his involvement. It certainly seemed that way during his final months at Chelsea, when he lost his place to Cesar Azpilicueta. But, even last season, when he did not have the advantage of regular football, he summoned memorable performances as Chelsea kept a clean sheet at Atletico Madrid and England did the same in Ukraine. He ought to be at his best in games when Roma are tested defensively. In that sense, the game at City will be a more accurate barometer on the direction of his form since leaving Chelsea, or on Sunday in Turin, when Roma face title rivals Juventus. Perhaps this is the week when Cole discovers if he will ever be anything other than a peripheral figure in the Eternal City. Like our MailOnline Sport Facebook page.

"Roberto Mancini is anticipating a ‘spectacular challenge’ for Roma from his former club Manchester City on Tuesday night. The 49-year-old, who led City to the Premier League title in 2012, gave an insight into where the Champions League clash at the Etihad will be won and lost in Italian newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport. Roberto Mancini gives his views on Manchester City's upcoming Champions League clash with Roma . Who are Roma’s dangermen? A complete Roma can beat City but the absences of Daniele De Rossi, Leandro Castan and Davide Astori make them more vulnerable. I have seen Juan Iturbe has been called up to the squad — he can create problems. In the counter-attack he can be devastating. Francesco Totti turned 38 at the weekend but is still important because, with the class he has, he knows how to move around the field. He runs less, but he makes the ball run. Francesco Totti can still cause Manchester City problems, says Roberto Mancini . Mattia Destro and Seydou Keita will both play important roles for Roma on Tuesday night . Mattia Destro scored a spectacular goal at the weekend. He has quality. I remember him at Inter. His technical ability is not under discussion, but he must grow. Young people often think when success comes on the field that their growth has finished. That is not so. Talent must be trained every day. Seydou Keita could mark Yaya Toure. Keita is a player I have always admired. At nearly 35, he belongs to the category of players who are incomprehensibly undervalued. Who is City’s player to watch? Yaya Toure. The midfielder is a force of nature who City are seeing the best of. Then there is the class of David Silva, the goalscoring instinct of Sergio Aguero and the running of Pablo Zabaleta. Yaya Toure is Manchester City's main man that Roma need to be wary of . City are a great team. They have been strong for several years and each year they manage to improve, buying very good players. At home they always express themselves well, they are very solid, they have so much possession and they have unpredictable players. The Premier League title will be between them and Chelsea. How do you beat City? The key is a fast start and to take advantage of the opportunities they offer. Roma have to be careful in defence, concentrate for 90 minutes and be clinical in attack. City practise a different style of football to the others in England — infinite passes, the ball on the ground, the ability to switch between patterns of attack in the middle or on the wings. City are not the Manchester United of a few years ago, all running and competitiveness. This could be an advantage for Roma.

"Vice President Joe Biden has been a non-factor in the debt and budget fight so far. The last news wire photos of him came ten days ago, and he hasn't made any public statements about the standoff that has gripped Washington . If Republicans were bluffing over Obamacare and the debt ceiling, it's now the Democrats' turn to play high-stakes poker. And the notoriously gaffe-prone Joe Biden has been called back from his Camp David vacation to put the screws on the GOP. The White House issued a statement on Monday saying that Obama would remind congressional leaders in the Oval Office at 3:00 p.m. that he 'will not pay a ransom for Congress reopening the government and raising the debt limit.' That meeting was postponed about 20 minutes before it was scheduled to begin. The White House released a statement saying the action was taken 'to allow leaders in the Senate time to continue making important progress towards a solution that raises the debt limit and reopens the government. Some observers are saying the hastily scheduled meeting will be a session of liars' poker whose stakes are half fiscal and half political. 'This whole shutdown has been completely unnecessary,' Obama told reporters during an unscheduled stop Monday afternoon at a Washington, D. C. soup kitchen, complaining that ''we've seen this brinksmanship time and time again to try and extract extreme partisan concessions.' Democrats had succeeded in pushing . Republicans off of their earlier bluff in which they threatened to keep . the government closed and risk a debt default unless the president . accepted significant changes to the Obamacare law. Now . the political left is demanding its own concessions, including a . long-term extension of the debt ceiling that would push off the next . fiscal precipice until after the 2014 midterm elections. Putting meat in the sandwich: Obama was due to meet party leaders at the White House in a bid to finally resolve the deadlock after spending the morning at a D.C. foodbank . Hard to swallow: Republicans will be angered by the bold demand from the Democrats after Obama has for the last month said he would not pay a 'ransom' Democrats . are also insisting that when the government reopens, it must be a . short-term fix. They want a chance to revisit the budget and increase . federal spending, according to a senior Democratic House aide. 'The Republicans are cutting the . budget to the bone,' the staffer said on Monday. 'We're not going to . jeopardize Social Security funding or Medicare because the GOP . wants to please its radical tea party base.' But Republicans counter that Reid, . the Democrats' leader in the Senate, would balloon government spending . far beyond what both houses of Congress agreed to in 2011, and even . further past what the January sequester agreement permits. Sen. Tom Barrasso told Fox News on Monday that Reid wants to see the federal . government spending 'a million dollars a minute for the next year.' Reid has told reporters that he hopes to arrive in the Oval Office with a deal proposal in hand. In addition to the long-term debt limit hike and the short-term leash to reopen the government, it will provide a delay – not a repeal – of an unpopular Obamacare-related medical device tax. Democrats are also reportedly willing to consider income-verification procedures for Americans claiming Obamacare's generous subsidies, but they insist that Republicans will have to make additional concessions in return. Those, Senate sources told MailOnline, would most likely be related to entitlement spending levels. Sen. John McCain quipped Sunday on 'Face The Nation' that Vice President Joe Biden, who has been all but invisible despite his decades in the U.S. Senate, must be somewhere in the federal witness protection program . While it's unclear how Republicans will react, Biden will be there to help Reid get what he wants. Both sides of the Senate clash said Monday afternoon before the White House meeting that they were making significant progress. 'We have had an opportunity over the last couple of days to have some very constructive exchanges of views about how to move forward,' Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the Senate floor. 'Those discussions continue, and I share [the] optimism that we’re going to get a result that will be acceptable to both sides.' Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid signaled his agreement, saying that 'constructive, good faith negotiations continue between the Republican leader and me.' 'I'm very optimistic that we will reach an agreement that's reasonable in nature this week to reopen the government, pay the nation's bills and begin long term negotiations to put our country on sound fiscal footing.' Reid and the Democrats want to reopen the government for only a few months, giving them the change to strong-arm Republicans into accepting still more government spending . President Obama (C) met on Saturday with Senate Democratic leaders (L to R) Dick Durbin, Chuck Shumer, Harry Reid and Patty Murray, but Joe Biden was MIA . Republican Sen. John McCain . complained during a Sunday television appearance that President Obama . has been a non-factor in the negotiations, and that Biden, who spent . decades in the Senate and has a reputation as a dealmaker, has been . nowhere in sight. 'I hope . the president will become engaged. Maybe we need to get Joe Biden out of . the witness protection program,' McCain told host Bob Schieffer. But the vice president will join Obama and the four most senior congressional leaders in a meeting whose agenda will be driven by Democrats. Reid and McConnell will be on hand with House Speaker John Boehner and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. As the Treasury Department's debt funding deadline approaches just three days from now, it's Democrats who suddenly have the wind at their backs and leverage in their pockets. On Capitol Hill, an aide to a senior Senate Republican was overheard talking to his boss during a walk through a Senate office building on Monday. 'Unless we hold the line on spending,' the staffer said, 'we're going to end up losing ground instead of gaining it. We've got to make sure Mitch [McConnell] gets that.' 'I'm still not sure who put us in this box,' added the aide, 'but we're in it.'","Biden hadn't been seen in D.C. for ten days and was vacationing at Camp David all weekend .

"Chris Hughton is confident he can stabilise Brighton before sending the Seagulls soaring towards the top end of the Sky Bet Championship. Hughton has returned to management at the AMEX Stadium, eight months after he was sacked by Norwich. The 56-year-old has signed a three-and-a-half-year deal to succeed Sami Hyypia, who has left him a squad firmly embroiled in a relegation battle. Chris Hughton has been named as the new manager of Championship side Brighton & Hove Albion . Hughton has joined the south coast club on a three-and-a-half year contract . Chris Hughton becomes the fifth black manager across the 92 clubs in the professional football leagues, joining: . 1. Fabio Liverani, Leyton Orient . 2. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, Burton Albion . 3. Chris Powell, Huddersfield Town . 4. Keith Curle, Carlisle United . Brighton are out of the drop zone on goal difference, after taking four useful points from two games under caretaker boss Nathan Jones. Brighton have been play-off semi-finalists for each of the past two seasons, firstly under Gus Poyet and then Oscar Garcia. Achieving that feat for a third straight year will almost certainly be beyond Hughton, but getting back in the play-off frame is the eventual aim for the former Tottenham, West Ham, Brentford and Republic of Ireland full-back. 'I want to get this club back challenging in the top six again,' said Hughton. 'With the infrastructure and everything that is in place here, that has to be the aim. Hughton was sacked as Norwich manager towards the end of last season . Sami Hyypia  resigned as manager of Brighton  on December 22 after a dismal start to the season . 'But that is further down the line. If I look at our position in the league, first we have to try and get some stability in the results, move us into a more comfortable position and then progress from there. 'As soon as I knew there was an opportunity to come here it was one that very much excited me. The infrastructure and where this club wants to be in the future was an important factor. You only have to look at the brand new training facility and stadium that's here to see the club's ambition. 'Over the past few years they have fared very well in the division and been very close to realising their ambitions in the last couple of seasons. For whatever reason this season has not gone so well, but one of the key factors in me deciding to join the club was the ambition and the calibre of staff here already. 'The initial challenge is obvious, we need to improve our league position. But we are working to get this club back challenging at the top end of the division. The Championship's bottom six, showing Brighton just above the relegation zone . Hughton takes charge of Brighton with the club one place above the relegation zone virtue of goal difference . 'Hopefully that won't take too long as I know the squad quite well and I have come across some of the players over the previous few seasons. I'm also familiar with the structure and some of the staff here at the club, so I hope that it is not going to take me too long to settle in.' Hughton thanked Jones for the job he did on an interim basis for the past couple of games - a 2-2 home draw with Reading and a 2-0 victory at Fulham - and confirmed that he will remain part of his staff. 'Nathan Jones will very much be part of my first-team coaching staff and he has done a fantastic job here,' said Hughton. 'I'm particularly grateful for the last two results and as somebody from the outside with a keen interest looking in, I was hoping that the last two results would fare well and he has done very well. 'I have a lot of respect for him as an individual and also as a coach, so I'm delighted to have him on board.'

"Denise Welch today faces fresh allegations that she cheated on her husband - this time with a gay toyboy who claims he met her at a wake. Tom Hopkins, 26, said that the Celebrity Big Brother winner was the 'first girl' he had ever been with and that he fell in love during their four-month 'relationship.' Shamefaced: Denise seen on Loose Women today, cringed when they showed footage of her topless in the Big Brother house . Revelations: The 53-year-old was back on the panel with Sherrie Hewson, Denise Welch and Carol McGiffin . Another toyboy: Tom Hopkins claims he had a four-month affair with Welch . 'I remember her saying to someone she could have anyone she wanted, but for some reason she had fallen in love with me,' the theatre producer told The Sun. A spokesman for Welch today denied the pair had had a relationship, saying  'We believe these allegations to be false'. Mr Hopkins is the second man in 24 hours to allege he has had an affair with 53-year-old Welch, who is married to actor Tim Healy. Party planner Lincoln Townley, 39, told The Sunday Mirror he had seen the actress for eight months. Mr Hopkins claims he met Welch in a London pub, where the wake was held, before sharing a taxi. During the journey, he told her he was gay. Put them away, love! Denise flashed her chest outside a wine specialist called Corks Out! during her husband's 60th birthday celebrations over the weekend . He said: 'She started kissing me and . stuff happened. She was basically semi-naked in the taxi. The taxi . driver just carried on driving.' The pair drove to a hotel in Mayfair where Mr Hopkins said mother-of-two Denise decided to take her dress off. In scenes reminiscent of her serial flashing on CBB, she then reportedly ran down the street in only her underwear. 'It was 4am or 5am and dark so no one spotted her,' Mr Hopkins said. Toyboy: Denise reportedly had an affair with party planner Lincoln Townley . He then went on to claim they met for . lunch dates and talked 'incessantly' on the phone - despite Welch being married for 23 years. He showed The Sun a series of text messages, including one saying: 'I'm your fiancée not your wife!! Maybe we rushed things xxxx'. The affair allegedly took place . during the sixth series of Dancing On Ice last year. Mr Hopkins said he . would stay with Welch in her Holiday Inn hotel room. She would introduce him as her best friend. Welch was crowned CBB winner on Friday after beating X Factor reject  Frankie Cocozza to first place. Yesterday, . the former Coronation Street star shrugged off the rumours, cheekily . flashing her husband during his 60th birthday celebrations. They had woken up to The Sunday Mirror's report about her alleged affair with Mr Townley. 'Everything's fine at home': Denise and Tim Healy have been married for 23 years . One of his friend's told the . newspaper that Welch met Townley at the Jet Black club in London last . April after filming Loose Women and had even spent the night with her . before she went into the Celebrity Big Brother house. He added: 'They started seeing each other on a . casual basis. Lincoln said she was the same away from the ­cameras as . she was on TV. He saw the Loose Woman in her come out when they were . partying together.' The . friend added that Welch would stay at his home occasionally but they . would mostly spend time in her hotel room near the Loose Women studios . after the show had been filmed and then she would head home to Cheshire . the following day. 'Lincoln said they have a great time . ­together, the age difference doesn’t matter. She is a party girl, . without doubt. He loves being with her because she’s such great fun. It . was very casual and all about ­having fun. ­Lincoln enjoyed it because . there was no emotional stress.' Triumphant: Denise proved popular with viewers and won Celebrity Big Brother . Lincoln . is even believed to have told friends that he was surprised that Welch never tried to hide their relationship and they were always seen . together at bars and restaurants in central London. But by the early autumn, the friend said their relationship started to get more serious and Welch began talking openly about her marriage problems and said she felt she was living a 'double life'. Last night, Welch issued a statement  saying: ‘It’s Tim's 60th birthday and we . are celebrating that and the fact that mummy is home after three weeks in . the BB house. We are not interested in the Sunday Mirror article.’ The actress has been candid about her previous affairs, both on Loose Women and in her autobiography.

"Beloved: West Virginia science teacher David Foggin (picture) was suspended from his job last week after posting a homophobic rant on Facebook. However, most of his students have voiced their support of him and his statements . A high school teacher was suspended from his position last week after writing a homophobic rant on Facebook. David Foggin was put on suspension last week after posting an advertisement for a meeting of Parkersburg South High School's gay-straight alliance club on his Facebook, including the following typo-laden comment: . 'Club meeting at PSHS. Rally around them and show ur support. We are also considering a drunks-t totaller club, drugged/sober club, smokeless tobacco v smokes club, street racing, and deer poaching clubs. Please donate and support us. Thank u!!! I think I hear the drag already zinging' Mr Foggin was put on suspension after high school administrators found out about the post, but he'll likely return to the classroom soon. The students go on spring break next week, and the school board is set to review the suspension after that to decide whether the suspension is paid or unpaid. 'It will be until spring break. He's not in the classroom this week,' Wood County Schools Superintendent Pat Law said. 'That's up to the board as to whether to approve it or not.' The incident is still under investigation. Opinionated: Mr Foggin was placed on suspension last week after posting this homophobic comment about the school's gay-straight alliance on his Facebook page . 'Our main concern here is our students and student rights,' Board of Education President Tim Yeater added, 'but we also have a vested interest in our employee rights.' However, many Parkersburg students are outraged Mr Foggin was suspended than offended by the comments he made on Facebook. Last Friday morning, a large crowd of students, parents and other community members gathered outside the school to voice their support of Mr Foggin. Less than a dozen turned out to speak out against the homophobic rant. 'This is stupid. He got suspended for no good reason,' one student told WTAP. 'It's all about his personality. If you actually knew him, you wouldn't be offended by that,' another student added. Standing by him: A large group of students, parents and other school community members held a protest Friday morning to support Mr Foggin . The minority: A small group of less than 12 turned out to protest against the teacher on Friday . Many held up signs reading 'Freedom of Speech' and 'We Love Foggin' while others wore orange t-shirts with 'Team Foggin' emblazoned on them. Even openly gay students came out to support the suspended science teacher. 'I'm gay myself and I didn't see the problem with it, half the gay kids in this school don't see a problem with it,' one student said. Picketing: The protesters held up signs reading 'Freedom of Speech', 'We Love Foggin' and 'Team Foggin' Not offended: Even openly gay students like the one above came out to support Mr Foggin on Friday . One of the other signs of support from Friday's protest . Supporters: Many involved in the rally on Friday wore t-shirts with 'Team Foggin' printed on them . However, a small minority of students did turn out calling for Mr Foggin's dismissal. 'I'm standing up for the kids in the school that are afraid. I think if he apologized it would be a lot better,' one student said.  'I feel if he gets fired, everyone that is gay or bi-sexual would feel a lot better.' Following his suspension last week, Mr Foggin responded with another comment on Facebook. 'I love everyone and I promote fairness and equality. I have difficulty with favoritism and bias given any person or group,' he wrote, adding that he planned to run for sheriff of Wood County in 2020. 'Thanks to all of u who promote equality and protection of the 1st amendment. PS....THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THE 2ND AMENDMENT!!! To make sure it stays that way. 'Love u all. Get a concealed carry permit while u still can. Protect urself and ur family. Thanks God for every breath he gives you,' Mr Foggin wrote. In addition to teaching science, Mr Foggin owns a side business selling guns and ammunition in Belleville, West Virginia. He also issued a statement to West Virginia Public Broadcasting, saying he loves his students and his stance was simply on 'equality and fair treatment'. 'If a student need someone to turn to for any situation they face in their life, I hope they know the staff at PSHS is always there for them. I also feel their parents/guardians should be aware they are seeking guidance and they maybe trained, licensed counselors should be involved,' he said.","Parkersburg South High School teacher David Foggin was put on suspension last week after writing a homophobic comment on Facebook .

"A white Texan girl who claims that she was refused admission to college because of her race will take her case to the Supreme Court tomorrow. If she wins, a precedent will be set throwing the use of race-conscious admissions policies at public universities into doubt. Abigail Fisher, who has since graduated from Louisiana State University, said she was subject to unequal treatment in violation of the 14th Amendment. Abigail Fisher says she was subject to unequal treatment in violation of the 14th Amendment in not being admitted to the University of Texas at Austin . And on Wednesday, all eyes will be on Justice Anthony Kennedy, whose vote is considered pivotal in the case brought Fisher who has sued the University of Texas at Austin, claiming that she was denied admission to the school in 2008 because of affirmative action. 'I was taught from the time I was a . little girl that any kind of discrimination was wrong, and for an . institution of higher learning to act this way makes no sense to me,' Fisher said in an interview clip posted on the website of the Project on . Fair Representation, a legal defense foundation that's providing her . with legal representation. On . the other side are lawyers for the University of Texas, who argue that, . like many other universities, UT seeks to assemble a class that is . diverse in innumerable ways -- including race -- and that 'race is just . one of many characteristics that form the mosaic presented by an . applicant's file.' More . than 90 friend of the court briefs have been filed in the case, with . the Obama administration weighing in favor of the university. Others, . who support Fisher, argue that diversity can be achieved through . race-neutral programs, and that race-preferential admissions policies . can do more harm than good. 'What's at issue is: (1) whether it will remain permissible to consider race in an attempt to ensure that higher level education remains integrated; and (2) whether universities or the court are going to be the ones to determine what academic diversity consists of,' said David D. Cole, a professor at Georgetown Law, who believes UT's plan should be upheld. It was only recently, in 2003, that the Supreme Court narrowly upheld the limited use of race in public university admissions policies in Grutter v. Bollinger. The five-four opinion was written by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who said that diversity was a compelling government interest. But O'Connor has since retired from the high court, and has been replaced by Justice Samuel Alito, who is more skeptical of race-conscious admissions preferences. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy's vote is thought to be pivotal to the decision the Supreme Court reaches in the Abigail Fisher case . In 1997, the Texas legislature passed the 'Top 10 Percent Law,' which mandates that Texas high school seniors in the top 10 percent of their class be automatically admitted to any Texas state university. But after the Grutter decision came down, another policy was added that allows the school to consider race among several other factors for admission. Fisher did not qualify for automatic admission, and was forced to compete with other non-top-10-percent state applicants. She said she was denied admission, even though her academic credentials exceeded those of some of the admitted minority candidates. The University of Texas, which was racially segregated during the first 70 years of its existence, argues that its current program exemplifies the type of plan the Supreme Court allowed in Grutter v. Bollinger: . 'Race is only one modest factor among many others weighed; it is considered only in an individualized and contextual way that examines the student in their totality.' The U.S. Supreme Court will begin hearing the case of Abigail Fisher tomorrow - who claims she was denied a place at college because of her race . But lawyers for Fisher said that the top 10 percent plan had made UT one of the most diverse public universities in the nation, and that the school did not need to overlay the successful race-neutral program with another one that considered race. Furthermore, they said that the school is working toward an impermissible goal of using race in admissions to mirror the demographics of Texas, which they said amounted to 'racial balancing.' While Fisher's lawyers argue that Grutter should be clarified or even overturned, supporters of UT's program take solace in Kennedy's opinion in Grutter. He ruled against the University of Michigan Law School program named in that case but said, . 'There is no constitutional objection to the goal of considering race as one modest factor among many others to achieve diversity, but an educational institution must ensure, through sufficient procedures, that each applicant receives individual consideration and that race does not become a predominant factor in the admissions decision making.' Despite those words, Kennedy has never -- in his entire career on the bench -- voted in favor of racial preferences. 'That fact makes it hard to predict how Justice Kennedy will address this plan,' said Cole. 'If any plan would satisfy Justice Kennedy, it would seem that this one would because the university formulated its plan to meet the specific objections that Justice Kennedy had to the Michigan affirmative action plan.' The University of Texas at Austin - where Abigail Fisher claims that she was denied a place due to affirmative action . Justice Elena Kagan will not participate in the case, because she dealt with it in her previous position as solicitor general. Lawyers for Fortune 100 companies filed a friend of the court brief on behalf of the UT, arguing that those who have been educated in a diverse setting are 'better equipped to understand a wider variety of consumer needs' and are 'likely to generate a more positive work environment by decreasing incidents of discrimination and stereotyping.' Even the National Association of Basketball coaches said in briefs, 'Our student athletes, and all of the students who attend our institutions, receive the best education when they are able to interact with others within a university community that is broadly diverse across its entire scope.' Filing on behalf of Abigail Fisher, three members of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights point to empirical evidence that they said shows that race-preferential admissions policies do more harm than good. 'If this research is right,' argued lawyers for commission members Gail Heriot, Peter Kirsanow and Todd Gaziano, . Abigail Fisher eventually took up a place at Louisiana State University . 'We now have fewer minority science and engineering graduates than we would have under race-neutral admissions policies.' There are six states that have laws banning the use of affirmative action in public universities (Arizona, Michigan, Nebraska, Washington, California and Florida, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures). The University of California has filed a brief arguing that its inability to consider race has hurt the school's diversity. The university said it has experimented with different strategies to address underreprestend minority student populations, but that these measures have enjoyed only 'limited success,' and that the school, particularly, in its most highly ranked campuses, has not been able to reverse a decline in minority admissions and enrollment. A decision in the current case, likely to come down sometime in early 2012, could have implications for private institutions that receive federal funding, as well as hiring decisions in public institutions.","In 1997, the Texas legislature passed .

"A two-week-long partial government shutdown originally blamed on a conservative Republicans' demands for Obamacare to be defunded is now stalling because liberal Democrats want to see an end to planned spending cuts, it emerged today. Obama has consistently insisted that he is not willing to pay a Republican 'ransom' as the deadlock continued but the reversal will see many Americans wondering who's the real aggressor in the fiscal 'hostage-taking' that the White House has decried for nearly a month. A budget impasse earlier in the year led to the so-called budget 'sequester' which walled off tens of billions of dollars in planned spending. Now Senate Democrats are demanding its complete rollback, in an audacious move that many in the GOP are seeing as a greedy overreach. Hard to swallow: Republicans will be angered by the bold demand from the Democrats after Obama, pictured at a foodbank in D.C. today. has for the last month said he would not pay a 'ransom' Federal government workers are tired of being furloughed because of the 13-day-old partial shutdown, but Senate Democrats have scuttled a hoped-for solution with new demands that would see Uncle Sam breaking the bank with new spending records . The White House issued a statement on Monday saying that Obama would remind congressional leaders in the Oval Office at 3pm that he 'will not pay a ransom for Congress reopening the government and raising the debt limit.' That meeting was postponed about 20 minutes before it was scheduled to begin. The White House released a statement saying the action was taken 'to allow leaders in the Senate time to continue making important progress towards a solution that raises the debt limit and reopens the government. Some observers are saying the hastily scheduled meeting will be a session of liars' poker whose stakes are half fiscal and half political. 'This whole shutdown has been completely unnecessary,' Obama told reporters during an unscheduled stop Monday afternoon at a Washington, D. C. soup kitchen, complaining that ''we've seen this brinksmanship time and time again to try and extract extreme partisan concessions.' On Saturday, leading senators from both parties were poised to announce a deal based on a proposal from Maine Sen. Susan Collins, a moderate Republican. The plan called for a debt-ceiling extension through the end of January and a six-month federal budget agreement at levels set by the January sequester. Also included were a two-year delay of the controversial medical-device tax under Obamacare, and a mechanism to verify the incomes of Americans claiming Obamacare-related subsidies. Then, according to Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain, Democrats 'moved the goalposts in light of ... polling data' that showed they could extract more concessions from Republican senators – in addition to the collapse of 'defund' and 'delay' Obamacare demands. 'We were ready to go to the press gallery' to announce a deal, McCain said Sunday on CBS' Face the Nation program. 'The Democrat leadership said no.' The always-understated Collins told CNN's Candy Crowley on the State Of The Union program that she was 'very surprised' to see Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid reject her plan at the last minute. 'I don't think it was very constructive,' she said. Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was more pointed, noting in a statement Sunday that Reid had already succeeded in forcing House Republicans to abandon their immediate hope of seeing Obamacare gutted. 'It's time for Democrat leaders to take ""yes"" for an answer,' McConnell said. Sen. Susan Collins (L) is steamed that Democrats have shot down her grand bargain, but it's Sen. John McCain (R) who seems more animated, saying liberals have 'moved the goalposts' and shifted the debate from Obamacare to new spending hikes . Senate Republicans have been basing their negotiations on the idea that annual federal spending would be capped at $967 billion, the number resulting from January's sequester cuts. In the House, the GOP has aimed at a slightly higher number – $988 billion – which was proposed last year by then-vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan, the Wisconsin chairman of the House Budget Committee. Senate Democrats now say they want a budget that spends $1.058 trillion, even as President Barack Obama claims to be presiding over a federal government in which annual deficits have steadily decreased. U.S. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell says he's tired of making concessions and getting still more demands in return"" 'It's time for Democrat leaders to take ""yes"" for an answer' The result has left some Republicans in the House feeling like they can't trust the Senate to shoot straight. 'This is getting ridiculous,' a senior House GOP aide told MailOnline on Monday. 'I hate to think our own guys in the Senate are jerking us around, but it's clear that at least the Senate Democrats are. I think they're reaching too far. And if Senate Republicans follow them off a cliff, we're not going to reach out a hand to pull them back this time.' Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York told reporters on Sunday that he's confident Democrats will get most of what they want.. 'We are not overplaying our hand,' Schumer said. 'We are open to discussion in every way, and I think our Republican colleagues are moving in our direction.' Some in the GOP are quietly saying they would accept a rollback of the sequester-related cuts – principally those connected to defense spending – but only if they were matched dollar-for-dollar by new cuts in entitlement spending. Democrats say that's a non-starter. And even if the two sides in the Senate should reach a compromise, there's no telling how the more conservative House Republicans would view it. Schumer  said Sunday that the impasse could last awhile: 'We're not going to overcome it in the next day or two.' GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham left a meeting with House Speaker John Boehner on Saturday, ready to do battle in the Sunday TV talk wars. 'You own Obamacare,' he would tell Democrats, 'and it¿s going to be a political gift that keeps on giving' Republicans, meanwhile, have seized on the 2013 sequester budget cuts and their underlying 2011 budget law in the same way Democrats have defended the 2010 Affordable Care Act – by insisting that it's settled law. 'It's funny,"" Kentucky GOP Senator Rand Paul said Sunday on CNN. 'They're all about Obamacare being the law of the land, but so's the sequester. If we exceed that, it's real big step in the wrong direction.' Rand Paul thinks it's 'funny' how Democrats insist Obamacare is 'the law of the land' but don't treat the budget 'sequester' with the same deference . 'I can't imagine you're going to get Senate Republicans to vote for something that exceeds the sequester caps. I think it's a huge mistake for the country.' Tennessee Republican Senator Bob Corker said on Fox News Sunday that 'the Democrats are on the verge of being one tick too cute as they see the House possibly in disarray. They now are overreaching.' Lawmakers have precious few days left to talk turkey: Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has warned that the federal government may not be able to pay its debt obligations as soon as Thursday, unless Congress authorizes an increase in the debt ceiling. And while Republicans are – so far –  unwilling to give up political ground on spending, they have all but abandoned their earlier Obamacare-related demands which sparked the current debt and budget crises. GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham said Sunday on ABC's This Week that Democrats should be prepared to take responsibility for Obamacare's failures and, perhaps, for its eventual collapse. 'To our Democratic friends,' he said, 'you own Obamacare, and it’s going to be a political gift that keeps on giving. So the shutdown will be old news next year, Obamacare’s faults will be front and center in 2014 – if we don’t screw this up.' 'What breaks my heart is, [in] the last 12 days you’ve had a complete meltdown of the portal called Obamacare. The whole system [is] just not working.' And, he said with regret, by allowing themselves to be dragged into a sequester-related Round Two of the budget crisis, Republicans are 'overshadowing how badly Obamacare has been rolled out.'","Obama once complained that Republicans were holding the White House for 'ransom,' but now it's Democrats who could bluff their way to victory .

"Controversial: Teacher Robert Duncan was fired after displaying cartoons created by his students, including this one depicting President Obama with what appears to be a bullet hole in his temple . A junior high school teacher from a small town in Louisiana is fighting to get his job back after getting fired for displaying controversial political cartoons depicting President Barack Obama drawn by his students. Robert Duncan, 52, was ousted from Boyet Junior High School in Slidell earlier this month after hanging up student artworks submitted as part of a lesson on political cartoons in January in the hallway outside his classroom. One of the cartoons appears to portray the president with a bullet hole in his head, while another implies that it was Obama hunting season. A concerned parent who saw the pictures and found them to be violent and incendiary photographed them on her cell phone and released the images to the media, setting off a firestorm that may have played a role in Duncan’s eventual dismissal. U.S. Secret Service agents visited two of the junior high students to investigate if they or their parents posed a real threat to Obama, and in the aftermath of the picture controversy, Duncan was placed on paid administrative leave for six months, AOL reported. On August 6, School Superintendent Trey Folse officially dismissed the eighth-grade teacher from Boyet, where he had spent 13 years teaching. During a wrongful termination hearing on Wednesday, Folse testified that Duncan was let go for ‘making a bad, incompetent’ decision by posting the ‘violent’ pictures, as well as for dishonesty. Lesson learned: Duncan gave his eighth-grade class an assignment to draw political cartoons, and among the submitted works was this poster implying that it was Obama hunting season . Media firestorm: A parent who visited the school in February noticed the cartoons hanging on the wall and became concerned, snapping photos of them with her cell phone which she then released to the media . But about two dozen of Duncan’s former colleagues at the school came to his defense, saying that political cartoons was an entirely appropriate  - and even recommended - assignment for an eighth-grade class. ‘I did not see the element of . racism,’ social studies teacher Mark Selzer told CNN. ‘I saw political . points of view being expressed, whether pro-Obama or anti-Obama, and . that's what the lesson was designed to do.’ Duncan’s . defense team had several Boyet teachers acknowledge that they too had . used political cartoons as part of their curriculum in the past, the Times Picayune reported. The . lawyers also pointed out that textbooks and state-mandated assessments . all ‘adopted and approved by the St. Tammany Parish School Board’ endorsed student learning through political cartoons. The . fired teacher insisted that the apparent bullet hole depicted in . one of the drawings was not there when he hung it in the hallway, and . seven of his former co-workers backed his version of events. He said, she said: Duncan, center, insisted that the apparent bullet hole drawing was not there when he hung the poster, although his student made a statement contradicting the teacher's claim . ‘That mark was not on that poster; I swear to God. Nobody could have missed that. There would have been hundreds of students saying things about that,’ long-time Boyet teacher Beth Kurz tearfully testified. However, the amateur artist responsible for the poster claimed that the alleged entry wound in the president’s right temple was the result of a marker that had been inadvertently dropped. The mishap took place the night before the assignment was due, and she had no time to fix it, the unnamed eighth-grader wrote in a letter read during the hearing, so she submitted it as is. Support group: Some two dozen teachers at Boyet Junior High School in Slidell signed a letter vouching for their former colleague and asking that he be reinstated . The final day of the three-day hearing was supposed to take place on Monday, but was postponed indefinitely due to Tropical Storm Isaac barreling towards Louisiana. When the appeals panel does reach a decision in Duncan’s case, it will only serve as a recommendation intended to guide the superintendent.","Robert Duncan, 52, was fired on August 6 from Boyet Junior High School in Slidell, Louisiana .

"Shock: Oprah Winfrey has told how she was refused service by a 'racist' shop assistant in Switzerland . She is one of the richest and most famous women on the planet. So when Oprah Winfrey popped in to an upmarket boutique for a new designer handbag she was taken aback when the shop assistant refused to show her a bag. She said the £24,460 crocodile skin item was ‘too expensive’. Instead of making a scene, the billionaire TV magnate calmly left the Swiss store. But she has now hit back at her treatment in a furious interview on US television, claiming she was a victim of ‘racism’. Miss Winfrey, 59, said: ‘I was in Zurich the other day, in a store whose name I will not mention. I didn’t have my eyelashes on, but I was in full Oprah Winfrey gear. 'I had my little Donna Karan skirt and my little sandals. But obviously The Oprah Winfrey Show is not shown in Zurich. ‘I go into a store and I say to the woman ‘‘Excuse me, could I see the bag right above your head?” and she says to me “No. It’s too expensive.”’ Miss Winfrey asked a second time to see the bag, which was locked in a cabinet to deter shoplifters. But oblivious to her fame and fortune, the shop assistant allegedly replied: ‘No, no, you don’t want to see that one, you want to see this one because that one will cost too much. You will not be able to afford that.’ It may have been beyond the salaries of ordinary mortals, but  £24,460 is small change to a celebrity worth about £1.8billion. Miss Winfrey added: ‘I could have had the big blow-up thing and thrown down the black card and all that stuff. Scroll down for video . Apology: Store owner Trudie Gotz said sorry for the incident but said it was due to a misunderstanding rather than racism . Controversy: The bag in question was a Jennifer bag in crocodile skin. Tom Ford designed the handbag for the actress, pictured with it left, . and now makes it in a number of different finishes, right . Turned away: The assistant serving Oprah Winfrey in the boutique owned by Trudie Goetz (pictured) told Oprah: 'You will not be able to afford that' when she asked to see a hanbag . ‘But why do that? But it [racism] still exists, of course it does.’ ‘I left the store but it proves that racism is still an issue,’ she added. Referring to a famous movie scene in . which Richard Gere tells a snobbish boutique salesman that he wants to . spend an obscene amount of money she added: ‘I wanted to create a Pretty . Woman moment and come back and buy everything and say ‘‘Big mistake!’’. But then I thought she’d get a commission, so let’s not do that,’ she . added . Miss Winfrey was in Zurich for the . wedding of her friend Tina Turner to Erwin Bach last month. She was . staying in the five-star Dolder Grand Hotel at the time. The incident happened in a branch of . the chic Trois Pommes chain of boutiques. Ironically, its owner Trudie . Goetz was also a guest at Miss Turner’s nuptials. Miss Goetz apologised for the incident, blaming it on a ‘misunderstanding’. ‘Everyone wants to sell a crocodile . bag,’ Ms Goetz said. ‘It’s a misunderstanding. She insisted her . saleswomen put customers first and try to be ‘kind’. However, Zurich trade president . Markus Hunig condemned the snub saying: ‘It’s totally unacceptable. I’ve . never heard of anything like it.’ Swiss tourism spokesman Daniela Bar . added: ‘We are totally ashamed about what happened. This sales assistant . was completely in the wrong. 'We apologise on behalf of Swiss tourism for what happened. ‘This was a one-off and will not have . a long lasting effect on the popularity of Switzerland, but the . saleswoman should apologise to Oprah Winfrey.’ It’s not the first time that Miss Winfrey has had a run in with a high-end boutique. In 2005 Hermes apologised to her after she was turned away from their Paris store because it was hosting a private function. Miss Winfrey’s allegations come as . Swiss authorities were criticised for introducing ‘apartheid’ style . plans to ban asylum seekers from public places such as swimming pools, . playing fields and libraries. Switzerland has 48,000 asylum seekers or one for every 332 inhabitants, which is double the European average. Race row: The owner of Trois Pommes, in Zurich, Switzerland, apologised after Oprah Winfrey said she had been the 'victim of racism' while visiting the store . Offense: A 'racist' shop assistant at Trois Pommes refused to show Oprah Winfrey a bag because it was 'too expensive' and she should look at the cheaper merchandise, the star claimed during a TV interview . Girls' weekend: Oprah Winfrey and best friend Gayle King ahead of Tina Turner and Erwin Bach's wedding celebrations in Zurich, Switzerland . Race row: Oprah Winfrey was a guest at the wedding of Tina Turner and Erwin Bach, pictured, in Zurich, Switzerland . Even if Oprah Winfrey had been allowed to look at the handbag, she may have thought twice before buying it. The £24,460 bag was reportedly a crocodile-skin version of one of Jennifer Aniston’s favourite designs. The Tom Ford Jennifer Bag, named after the 44-year-old former Friends star, is often seen on the arm of fashion-conscious celebrities. But as Miss Winfrey is a strident opponent of animal fur clothing  and was named 2008 Person of The Year by animal rights group PETA, she may have felt crocodile skin was a step too far. The TV host has occasionally worn leather belts and scarves, but crocodile skin is seen by some campaigners as being particularly cruel, given the poor treatment exotic species are often subjected to by farmers. A spokesman for Tom Ford could not be contacted to confirm if the handbag was made of real or  imitation crocodile skin.","Oprah Winfrey was in Zurich to attend Tina Turner's wedding when incident happened .

"Take a lift up to the 17th floor viewing platform of Riga’s towering Academy of Sciences, and you can see why this attractive old city is known as the capital, not of Latvia, but of 'Flatvia'. Scan the horizon in every direction, and there is not so much as a hillock in sight. As far as the eye can see, there is nothing but straight roads, a wide river (the Daugava) and distant forests. Mind you, there are plenty of vertical sights within the historic confines of Old Riga. Coming into the light: Riga endured a tough 20th century, but has established itself in the 21st . Church spires here do not just soar, they slice into the sky. Look straight ahead, and you see not just the bell tower of St Peter’s Church heading heavenwards, but that of the city’s cathedral, too. To your right, the domes of the Russian Orthodox Church shimmer in the sun like golden globes. Meanwhile, down at ground level, there are pretty streets, uncrowded squares and, best of all, cake shops every 50 yards or so. You can lose a whole morning, working your way though a plateload of pastries and apple turnovers. Sped on their way by a glass or two of balzams, a rooty-tasting dark liqueur (£1.50 a glass). The biggest bonus of visiting Riga is that all the best bits are within walking distance. Start at the castle, in the northernmost part of the old town, and it’s barely a mile to the southernmost point, in the four giant hangars that house the central market, or Centraltirgus. These circular-roofed halls once housed factories in which zeppelins were made. Today the only sausage-shaped items on show are giant salamis and elongated pumpkins. More than a stag party free-for-all: Riga revels in delightful cafe culture (left), and proffers wonderful historic architecture on the central plaza of Town Hall Square (right), where St Peter's Church is a major landmark . You can buy fur hats, religious icons, amber necklaces, jars of honey and loaves of all colours, shapes and sizes. Oh, and don’t forget the chocolate, either. Much of this is made by a long-established company called Laima, whose history is intricately  interlaced with Latvia. So much so, that instead of agreeing to meet under the clock at Victoria Station, Rigans traditionally arrange to rendezvous beneath the landmark Laima clock, which has stood in the centre of town for the last 90 years. And if chocolate provides Latvians with get-up-and-go, the thing that slows them down is beer - or alus, as it’s called. There are two main types: one is yellow and lager-like, and called gaiss. The other is dark and stout-like and called tumss. There is no waiting for the sun to go down over the yardarm, either; mid-morning is a perfectly respectable time for your first half-litre. No prizes, either, for spotting those locals who have over-alus-ed, and are finding it difficult to negotiate the cobblestones. Rather less discreet, are the UK stag and hen parties who are drawn to Riga, not so much for its historic ambience, as the fact that you can buy a pint of beer for 80p. The bad news is that you might find yourself sharing a plane with them on the way out. The good news, is that once you’re in Riga, you can spot them coming from a mile away (not to mention hear them), and slip off down some 17th century alleyway. That’s not to say you won’t hear English spoken. Not even close to the Caribbean: Riga sits close to lovely Baltic beaches which come alive in summer . Every shop, bar or restaurant has staff who speak fluent English; many Latvian schools and universities make a point of using textbooks in English, rather than Latvian or Russian. You don’t have to look further than the sinister, crumbling building at No.61 Brivibas Street to understand the reason. For many years, this was the headquarters of the Russian KGB, where Latvians were incarcerated and interrogated. Recently, the building has been opened up to the public, and as well as hearing recordings of people imprisoned there, you can visit the cells and even get a glimpse of the execution chamber. There is no question that the 20th century did not go well for Latvia. With no hills to deter invaders, both the German Nazis and the Russian Communists took turns in terrorising the population. That said, since Latvia won its independence from the Soviet Union, back in 1991, the 21st century is proving a lot more successful. Riga has a beautiful, 20-mile stretch of golden sand at Jurmala, just a short distance from the city centre. Take one of the many trains from the Central Station, and within 40 minutes, you are no longer walking on pavement, but paddling barefoot in the Baltic. Here, an altogether different Latvia is being created. Among the elegant old mansions and wooden cottages, shiny new apartments are being built just 50 yards from the beach (screened by trees). What’s more, the Russians are back. Not this time as cruel and domineering rulers, but as buyers of the various properties that are being built at Jurmala. Latvia may not have quite the same kind of year-round temperatures as Marbella. Nevertheless, with restaurant meals costing £15 a head, and a flight time from the UK of just two-and-a-half hours, the sun may at long last be emerging in this little corner of Eastern Europe. Thomas . Cook (01733 224800, www.thomascook.com) offers three-night stays for . two, with breakfast, at the four-star Maritim Park Hotel in Riga.

"Victim: 18-year-old Andre McCollins was restrained face-down on the floor of a classroom and then given 31 electric shocks . This shocking new video shows how a disabled teenage boy was tied up and given 31 electric shocks over seven hours by his laughing teachers. Writhing in agony and screaming to be saved student Andre McCollins was strapped face down and 'tortured' because he would not remove his coat at the Judge Rotenberg Center in Canton, Massachusetts. McCollins, who has learning difficulties, is currently suing Rotenberg . and three staff for his treatment ten years ago, which left him in a . three-day coma caused by fear. A courtroom just outside Boston was shown the horrific scenes as the case against the school is considered. Testifying yesterday his tearful mother Cheryl, who sent him to the private school for disabled children said: 'I never signed up for him to be tortured, terrorised, and abused. I had no idea—no idea—that they tortured the children in the school. 'I couldn't turn Andre's head to the left or to the right. He was just staring straight. I took my hands and went like this (waves hand in front of her face), he didn't blink.' Doctors have also said that the school could have killed the boy. 'He was essentially in what we would call a catatonic condition. That means a condition that happens with people that are acutely psychotically disturbed and they let him stay in the facility basically sitting still, not eating, refusing fluids for the most part, for the next few days. They’re lucky he didn’t die,'  expert witness Dr Marc Whaley said. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Pain: The disabled boy is shown in the centre of the picture writhing and screaming as the staff pump electricity through him . Attack: The staff are shown on top of the teenager after shocking him out of a chair just because he would not take off his coat . 'This violated -- in a gross fashion -- accepted standards of care,' he added. The school has been widely criticised for using electro-shock therapy to treat its disabled pupils. Two years ago the UN said the technique used there amounted to 'torture', and urged Obama's government to stop to it. In October 2002, Andre McCollins, then 18, was confronted by staff who wanted him to take off his coat. Tearful: His emotional mother Cheryl told the court how her son was completely lifeless after the ordeal . The new video shows him being shocked in a chair and collapsing to the ground before being jumped on by several staff. He was then tied down and shocked continuously for hours and McCollins says that some were laughing as he writhed in pain. Later that day his mother rescued him and took him to a nearby children's hospital where they said he was suffering from 'acute stress'. School: The center says its treatment turns around students and any pain merely feels like a pinch . Established in 1971 to help 'fix' children who are disruptive and intent on self-harm, the school is known for their use of harmful tactics they believe induces positive changes in behaviour. According to literature provided by the school, children do not feel the electric shocks are anything for students or parents to be concerned about. 'This treatment, which feels like a hard pinch, has been extensively validated in the scientific literature...is extremely effective, and has no significant adverse side effects,' the paperwork says.

"Earlier this month, the Mawer family jetted off on their summer holiday from Gatwick. Instead of getting up horrendously early for the three-hour drive from Bath to the airport, we chose the far more civilised option of staying in a hotel at Gatwick the night before. We booked in to the new Hampton by Hilton London Gatwick Airport (hamptoninn3.hilton.com), paying £84 B&B for a family of four. Scroll down for video . Enjoy a lie in: The Hampton by Hilton hotel is joined to Gatwick's North Terminal by a 50-yard walkway . Good night's sleep: Rooms at the Hampton by Hilton London Gatwick Airport are sound-proofed . In terms of convenience, the location is hard to improve on. The hotel is joined to Gatwick's North Terminal by a 50-yard walkway, and even if your flight is from the South Terminal, it's still a great location: the shuttle train between the terminals is a short walk away. The hotel's bedrooms are perfectly sound-proofed and comfy, with big walk-in showers. In our room, the sofa bed was a bit of a squeeze for our two boys, but the moment I politely pointed this out to the receptionist, she gave us a second room at no extra cost - thanks to the chain's no-quibble satisfaction guarantee. After a very decent breakfast, we made our way in leisurely fashion directly to airport security. We'd checked in our bags the previous evening - another advantage of staying overnight at the airport. If you fancy doing the same this summer, here are my tips for booking affordable airport hotels... A night at the Premier Inn London Gatwick Airport will cost £49 to £63, room-only, if you book for a night in the next few weeks. But book now for January and the cost is £35 on most nights . Short stroll: Guests can walk to Gatwick's North Terminal or catch the shuttle train to the South Terminal . BOOK WELL AHEAD . Though the price at the Gatwick Hampton by Hilton doesn't vary much, at other hotels rates can be a good deal cheaper if you book well ahead. For example, a night at the Premier Inn London Gatwick Airport (premierinn.com) will cost £49 to £63, room-only, if you book for a night in the next few weeks. But book now for January and the cost is £35 on most nights. At the Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport (Bath Road), the rates for January are as low as £29. COMPARE THE DEALS . Go to Holiday Extras (holidayextras.co.uk), an agent specialising in airport hotels. Its website shows you at a glance the rates on your chosen night at a wide selection of hotels - along with detailed information on each hotel and hundreds of guest reviews. Also look at gosimply.com, which compares airport hotel rates from other agents. At some airport hotels, a night's stay plus parking can cost little more than the cost of parking on its own . Cutting the cost: The Premier Inn Heathrow Airport was charging £114.85 for a 15-night Sleep, Park, Fly package in early September . CONSIDER PARK-AND-STAY . At some airport hotels, the cost of the night's stay and a week or fortnight's parking can come to little more than the cost of airport parking on its own. In early September at the Premier Inn Heathrow Airport (Bath Road), I was quoted £114.85 for a 15-night Sleep, Park, Fly package. Parking on its own would cost £106.26. BEWARE 'CHEAPER' OPTIONS . Staying at a 'cheaper' hotel a few miles from the airport can be a false economy. Lengthy transfers from the hotel to the airport can not only waste time but also cost extra. The website holidayextras.co.uk usefully indicates the time and cost of the transfers.","Overnight stay is a civilised option and bags can be checked in night before .

"Scotland Yard apologised yesterday to the family of Ian Tomlinson as it paid out a substantial sum in damages and legal costs. Senior officers apologised ‘unreservedly’ for the clash that led to the newspaper seller’s death during the G20 riots in 2009. In an unusual move, they branded the actions of disgraced Pc Simon Harwood ‘excessive and unlawful’ despite his acquittal for manslaughter. Ian Tomlinson is pushed over by Pc Simon Harwood in footage taken at the time. He was then helped up and staggered a short distance before collapsing . Riot police move Ian Tomlinson on during G20 protest. The Met has admitted ¿significant failings¿ in the case . And they admitted ‘significant failings’ in vetting procedures which did not prevent the officer re-joining the ranks despite a history of misconduct. Mr Tomlinson’s grieving family said the apology and compensation deal was ‘as close as we are ever going to get for justice’ after a four year fight. It brings to an end another ignominious chapter in the history of Britain’s largest force which not only employed a thug but misled the public over the tragedy. His widow, Julia Dawood, of the Isle of Dogs, East London, said it meant her family could ‘finally start looking to the future again’. Julia Tomlinson, widow of Ian Tomlinson, says the family can now move on with their lives . She attacked police for forcing them to take ‘apart untruthful accounts’ of what happened and labelled Harwood’s acquittal ‘unimaginable’. She said: ‘We will never understand the verdict, but at least today’s public admission of unlawful killing by the Met is the final verdict, and it is as close as we are ever going to get for justice.’ She added: ‘It will always be painful for us that Ian died so violently, but at least he is at rest now, and the force has publicly acknowledged the truth. ‘We hope that lessons have been learned and that other families will be spared the tragedy and ordeal that we have had to face.’ Mr Tomlinson, 47, was caught up in the anti-capitalism demonstrations in the City as he walked home in April 2009. He died after being struck by a baton and pushed to the ground by Pc Harwood who was in a line of riot officers. He was also bitten by a police dog. Mr Tomlinson stood up and walked a short distance before collapsing and dying from internal bleeding. Police did not admit their involvement until a shocking amateur video capturing his last moments was passed to a national newspaper. It triggered a firestorm of controversy that led to an inquest in which a jury returned a verdict of unlawful killing. They found he died from a haemorrhage caused by blunt force trauma, to which Mr Tomlinson was particularly vulnerable due to his alcoholism. Pc Harwood, a member of the Met’s controversial territorial support group, was charged with manslaughter but acquitted. Last September he was dismissed by a misconduct panel for using unnecessary and disproportionate force. PC Simon Harwood has a history of misconduct and was once dismissed for using unnecessary and disproportionate force . The Met said the size of the out-of-court settlement will remain secret and it brings to an end all litigation connected to the case. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Maxine de Brunner said the actions of Pc Harwood ‘fell far below the standard we expect from our officers.’ She said: ‘I apologise unreservedly for Simon Harwood’s use of excessive and unlawful force, which caused Mr Tomlinson’s death, and for the suffering and distress caused to his family as a result.’ Speaking about Pc Harwood’s readmission to the Met in 2004, she said there were ‘insufficient’ checks, adding: ‘We got it wrong.’","Ian Tomlinson died from internal bleeding after being shoved to ground .

"In an attempt to get rid of 'gendered space,' a school district in Nebraska has asked instructors to stop using words like 'boys and girls.' The Journal Star found the Lincoln Public Schools system circulated a handout for the new year, telling teachers to use specific terms like 'purple penguins' instead. The instructional handout, entitled '12 easy steps on the way to gender inclusiveness,' listed step 2 as: 'Don't use phrases such as ”boys & girls,"" ”you guys,” ”ladies and gentlemen,"" and similarly gendered expressions to get kids’ attention.' Inclusion: A handout circulated to teachers in Lincoln suggested using like 'campers' to avoid gendered terms like 'girls' and 'boys' 'Instead say things like ”calling all readers,"" or ”hey campers"" or ""could all of the athletes come here."" Create classroom names and then ask all of the ”purple penguins"" to meet at the rug,' it read. Administrators at the district had focused on transgender students before the start of the school year in order to be able to spot issues before they arise. In addition to training, administrators passed around a profile of a transgendered person in the local news and Time Magazine's cover story on the issue. One parent in the district worries that the training pushes an agenda, calling the change 'social engineering.' Rachel Terry, who has children attending high school and middle school in Lincoln, sent out three training documents in an email to other parents, calling them to join her at an October school board meeting. 'By sidelining academic teacher training and replacing it with social re-engineering, the LPS administration has placed a higher priority on social reformation than on education,' the email read. Lesson plan: Rachel Terry says she has a child that attends Southeast High School and opposes teachers receiving the handouts because they attacked 'religious values' She included three handouts, at least two of which were circulated among staff at Lincoln Public Schools that Terry said promoted 'the deconstruction of fundamental family and religious values.' 'The agenda we’re promoting is to help all kids succeed,” said Brenda Leggiardo, LPS coordinator of social workers and counselors. 'We have kids who come to us with a whole variety of circumstances, and we need to equitably serve all kids.' The gender inclusiveness guide is coming at a time of increased attention to gender issues in the United States. A study released in January by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and the Williams Institute found there was a strong prevalence of bullying and violence faced by transgender and gender non-conforming students. Rates of suicide attempts for these individuals was reported at 41 percent, almost 10 times that of the general population.","The instructional handout for teachers was passed around as Lincoln Public Schools administrators were trying to sensitively address transgender issues .

"A 14-year-old special needs student was allegedly raped after a teacher convinced her to act as bait in a bid to catch a school's sexual predator. The girl was said to have become involved in the plan after faculty members at Sparkman Middle School in Toney, Alabama, received complaints that a boy had been luring classmates into bathrooms and asking them for sex. Despite the constant allegations of sexual misconduct, he could not be punished because  he had not been 'caught in the act'. Therefore a teacher asked the young girl to meet him in the bathroom but would rush in before anything could happen, according to court documents. A vice principal at Sparkman Middle School in Toney, Alabama, asked a girl to act as bait so they could catch a sexual predator in the act . The plan took a horrifying turn when the suspect asked the girl to meet him in a different bathroom - meaning no one came in to save her. The girl had allegedly told the school's vice principal Jeanne Dunaway of the plan, but according to court documents, she didn't respond. In the aftermath of the alleged rape in January 2010, when a lawsuit was filed against the school, one vice principal claimed that the girl was responsible for herself when she went into the bathroom. Another, according to the documents, said that they 'weren't sure whether she consented' to the alleged assault. About a week before the suspected attack vice principals Dunaway and Teresa Terrell received a complaint that the boy had touched a female student inappropriately and was assigned in-school suspension, according to federal attorneys. About a week before the alleged rape vice principals Jeanne Dunaway (left) and Teresa Terrell (right) received a complaint that the boy had touched a female student inappropriately. They both still work at the school . A few days later, June Simpson, a teacher's aide at the Huntsville-area school, told the principal, Ronnie Blair, that the boy had 'repeatedly tried to convince girls to have sex with him in the boys' bathroom on the special needs students' corridor'. She alleged that he even had sex with one student, according to the brief. On January 22, the suspected predator approached the victim and asked her for sex, an offer which she had repeatedly refused. When the girl told Simpson, she encouraged the girl to 'meet (the boy) in the bathroom where teachers could be positioned to 'catch him in the act' before anything happened,' according to the brief. The girl's attorney Eric Artrip said they had found 'substantial evidence' that his client had been forcibly raped . The girl initially refused, but then agreed, according to her attorney Eric Artrip. Simpson and the girl went to Dunaway's office to explain the plan, but Dunaway allegedly 'did not respond with any advice or directive'. The girl left Dunaway's office, found the boy in the hallway, and 'agreed to meet for sex,', the documents state. But instead of meeting in the boys' bathroom on the special needs students' corridor, the boy told the girl to meet him in the sixth-grade boys' bathroom, in another part of the school. This meant none of the staff could intervene and stop her from the alleged attack. The girl's attorney Eric Artrip told CNN: 'We found substantial evidence of a forceful rape, and that's what happened here. 'The idea she consented to this and somehow allowed it to happen is incredible.' In December a Federal Court threw out claims that the school district violated Title IX of federal law which dictates how schools must respond to allegations of sexual harassment. The Department of Justice and U.S. Department of Education filed an amicus brief Wednesday supporting her family's federal lawsuit against the Madison County School Board in Alabama. It states that using a child as 'rape bait' clearly violates Title IX'. It adds: 'School administrators knew the student's extensive history of sexual and violent misconduct and were alerted to the substantial risk he posed.' The school's faculty are appealing the state civil suits. One of the vice principals has now been promoted to a principal at a nearby elementary school. The teacher involved in setting up the plan has resigned.","Horrifying plan allegedly took place at Sparkman Middle School in Toney .

"One twin uses an iPad, plays video games and dances to Michael Jackson tunes. The other has significant, possibly permanent, problems walking and talking. The delicate separation 10 years ago of conjoined twins from the Philippines wasn’t perfect, but the boys’ mother says their very survival is reason enough to celebrate the anniversary. 'When they were born, the doctors at home told me, ‘'You have to choose which one is to live'',’ Arlene Aguirre said. 'I said, ''I cannot choose that''. The doctors here did not ask me to choose.' Scroll down for video . Happy anniversary: Clarence Aguirre (left) embraces his twin brother Carl (right) while relaxing at the family's home with their mother Arlene in Scarsdale, New York. On Monday, the formerly-conjoined twins, 12, are celebrating the ten year anniversary of the risky surgery that separated them . Precarious: The boys, seen aged 17-months-old en route to New York from the Phillipines for their separation, would have died if they remained conjoined, doctors said . Recovery: The pair sit up and play just four months after the risky operation that separated at Montefiore Medical Center in New York in December 2004 . The boys, now 12, were born joined at the top of their heads, unable to sit up, stand straight, eat normally — or see each other. Once their case was accepted by the Children’s Hospital at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, leaving Carl and Clarence conjoined was not an option. 'If they hadn’t come to us when they did, they would have just withered away and died,' said Dr. Robert Marion, the boys’ pediatrician, who plans to be at the hospital Monday to mark the separation anniversary. 'I am extremely proud of having been a part of this. 'I’m a little disappointed with some of the outcome but, clearly, to see how these kids have survived and are for the most part thriving, is really wonderful.' Montefiore’s president and CEO, Dr. Steven Safyer, said: 'We are honored to have played a part in helping these boys develop into the unique individuals they are today.' The boys were separated on Aug. 4, 2004, in an operation that climaxed a then-unusual 'staged separation' that took four surgeries over nine months. When it was over, Dr. David Staffenberg, the boys’ plastic surgeon, told the mother: 'You’re now the mother of two boys.' Grown-up: Carl (left) uses a wheelchair and leg braces, with limited use of his arm and leg. Clarence (right) is very active, his mother said, but can be hard to understand verbally . Aguirre, who never left the area after the operation and now raises the boys in Scarsdale, said she throws birthday parties twice a year — on April 21, the day they were born, and on Aug. 4. 'The historical treatment was basically to sacrifice one to save the other,' said the lead surgeon, Dr. James Goodrich. 'The staged separation turned out to be obviously very successful.' He and his team have since separated four other sets of joined-at-the-head twins in London, Melbourne and Riyadh. The Aguirre boys shared a 'bridge' of brain, 5 or 6 centimeters long, that had to be divided. 'When you get beyond 1 centimeter or 2 centimeters, one or both kids takes a hit,' Goodrich said. Eventually there was some degeneration of Carl’s right parietal lobe, which controls the left side, Goodrich said. Playtime: Clarence (left) acts like a big brother to Carl (right) and loves to read to him . Carl suffered seizures, now controlled with medication, and has limited use of his left arm and leg. Carl uses a wheelchair and leg braces, and there’s hope he’ll eventually be able to walk on his own, though Goodrich doubts there will be a full recovery. As for speech, his mother said he can utter just a word or two at a time, such as 'bye' and 'thank you'. He spends the school day in classes for kids with multiple disabilities and gets occupational, physical and speech therapy. She said Clarence, who can be difficult to understand when he speaks, also gets some special instruction in communication. But unlike Carl, he is an attention-seeking preteen who leaps up to high-five visitors and is quick to show them his favorite video games. 'He’s kind of a delightful kid,' said Marion, who is chief of genetics at the Children’s Hospital. 'I think he’s going to be a typical adult.'","Twins Carl and Clarence Aguirre were born conjoined at the head in 2002 in the Philippines .

"Liverpool have agreed a deal with Bayern Munich for Pepe Reina with the goalkeeper set for a medical on Wednesday as he finally heads for a permanent exit. The Spaniard spent last season out on loan at Napoli after being frozen out by Brendan Rodgers, with seemingly no way back into the manager's plans. Reina did fly out to America with the Reds last week and trained with the squad but didn't even make the bench against Manchester United in the International Champions Cup on Monday night. VIDEO Scroll down for Pepe Reina is back in thick of it with Liverpool in training . Heading for the exit: Liverpool have accepted a bid from Bayern Munich for goalkeeper Pepe Reina . Just a bit of light stuff: Reina trained with Liverpool in America but didn't make the bench against Man United . VIDEO Reina deal imminent - Rummenigge . Karl-Heinz Rummenigge expanded on the club's official website, saying: 'The player will come to Munich in the next few days for a medical exam and to sign his contract. Pepe Reina was eager to come to Bayern Munich. 'He wanted to embark on this adventure even though he knows that, in Manuel Neuer, he has a keeper in front of him who, if nothing changes, will always remain the number one.' Rodgers has made no secret of preferring Simon Mignolet in between the sticks as the ex-Sunderland 'keeper immediately commanded the No 1 spot at Anfield on arrival. The writing was on the wall for Reina from the get-go and Liverpool have allowed the 31-year-old to talk to the German champions after a bid in the region of £2million. Reina has attracted interest from Napoli and AC Milan although neither are able to match his financial demands with the keeper commanding around £110,000 a week. However, the finances are no problem for wealthy Bayern. All that remains is for Reina to agree. Pep Guardiola's side face an MLS All-Star XI on Wednesday, but Reina is unlikely to be involved. And that could be a recurring theme, with Manuel Neuer an immovable object in goal for Bayern. Current Bayern Munich reserve Tom Starke and rival Lukas Raeder each featured in two games last season. Reina fits the bill as an experienced alternative after starring on the European and international stage for Liverpool and his country. Liverpool are wrapping up a deal for Javier Manquillo from Atletico Madrid and are continuing negotiations with Sevilla over a £16m deal for Spain left-back Alberto Moreno which could yet include 20-year-old midfielder Suso going to Sevilla on loan. No chance! Brendan Rodgers has frozen out Reina, who spent time out on loan at Napoli last year . No moving: Simon Mignolet has been Rodgers' No 1 goalkeeper since signing from Sunderland . As well as adding to his defensive ranks, Guardiola also seems keen to keep hold of the players he has and on Tuesday dismissed reports linking central defender Jerome Boateng with Barcelona. Spain's Marca radio suggested the Catalan club were closing in on the Germany defender, an alternative candidate to his compatriot Mats Hummels to reinforce the Primera Division side's defence this season. But speaking at a press conference in Portland, where Bayern are currently preparing for the new season, Guardiola said there was no truth whatsoever to the story and he had no intention of letting the former Manchester City defender go. Quash: Pep Guardiola says Bayern defender Jerome Boateng won't be leaving the club this summer . 'I don't usually say anything about things I read in the newspaper, but I am planning 100 percent with him here,' Guardiola said. The Spaniard added that he did not expect club bosses to order him to sell any of his first-choice players either as the Bavarians prepare an assault on a hat-trick of Bundesliga titles this season. He need not worry about that in the case of Boateng, though, with Rummenigge telling the Bild newspaper that the rumours were 'laughable'. Boateng joined Bayern from City in 2011 and he extended his contract until 2018 only last December.

"Alberto Moreno is close to completing his £16million switch to Liverpool from Sevilla as the Reds continue to bolster their squad ahead of the new season. As Brendan Rodgers homes in on finalising a deal for the highly rated left-back, Sportsmail gives you a rundown on the 22-year-old in demand. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Pile on! Moreno celebrates with Spain team-mates in training . Running the line: Alberto Moreno is close to sealing a £16m switch to Liverpool from Sevilla . So tell me a little about Alberto Moreno... He is a 22-year-old left back that plays for Sevilla, after emerging through the club’s youth system. He has played three times for Spain and is rated as one of the most talented players in his position in Europe. Moreno made 40 appearances last season and was part of the Sevilla side that won the Europa League. Have Liverpool been watching him for long? Yes, they have had their eye on Moreno for some time now. A deal looked close at the beginning of the summer but Liverpool baulked at Sevilla’s £20m asking price, valuing the player in the region of £14m. Competition: Spain defender Moreno (left) is expected to vie with Jon Flanagan for Liverpool's left-back spot . So why have they gone back in for Moreno? Ryan Bertrand emerged as the prime target but Chelsea were reluctant to do business with a potential title rival and the player also wanted to be guaranteed first-team football, as he will be on loan at Southampton this season. Can we expect the deal to be wrapped up soon? Liverpool chief executive Ian Ayre is understood to be travelling to Spain this weekend to seal the deal. A compromise of around £16m is thought to have been reached between Liverpool and Sevilla. Why have Liverpool been so keen to draft in a left back? It has emerged as a problem position for Reds boss Brendan Rodgers. Jose Enrique suffered a long-term injury last season but some had already questioned his credentials as an elite-level full back. Aly Cissokho’s loan spell was erratic and he has returned to Valencia. Jon Flanagan, 21, will provide stiff competition for Moreno though.

"He grew up harbouring hopes of shining amid a galaxy of stars at Barcelona. Jonathan Soriano’s Nou Camp dreams soon came crashing back to earth, but the forward has certainly found his wings again with Red Bull Salzburg. The former Barca B striker, who is aiming to floor Celtic in the Europa League at Parkhead on Thursday, can claim to be the only striker in Europe to have outscored Real Madrid icon Cristiano Ronaldo at club level so far in 2014. Jonathan Soriano failed to make the grade at Barcelona but has found his form at red Bull Salzburg . Soriano has netted 53 goals for the Austrian side to Ronaldo’s 49. Last season, he finished fifth in the European Golden Shoe rankings, behind Diego Costa, Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Ronaldo. Soriano is currently revelling in his duel with the holder of the FIFA Ballon d’Or, although he admits it is a battle he cannot win. ‘Being (in contention) with Ronaldo is nice and I want to enjoy it,’ said Soriano recently. ‘But fighting for the Golden Shoe is difficult, I don’t think about that. In Austria, each goal counts for less (than goals scored in Spain), so I’d have to score lots and lots more to win.’ Soriano’s numbers are certainly impressive. In 15 Europa League matches, he has scored 16 goals; an average of one every 77 minutes. In all matches this season, the 29-year-old has scored 28 in 26 games; a goal every 75 minutes. In less than two years, he has accumulated a staggering 110 goals for Salzburg, including 11 in last year’s Europa League, finishing top scorer in the competition. Celtic goalkeeper Craig Gordon, who picked a Soriano free-kick out of his net in the 2-2 draw in Austria, has already pinpointed the Spaniard as the biggest danger to his side’s hopes of reaching the last 32. The Spanish forward has scored 16 goals in 15 Europa league matches - that's one every 77 minutes . ‘He is very good,’ said the Parkhead No 1, who hopes to wrap up qualification before a tricky final-day tie away to rivals Dinamo Zagreb. ‘Not just his free-kick, his all-round play was very good. He’s very dangerous and we’ll need to try to stop him.’ Soriano has certainly attracted attention. After his hat-trick in a 5-1 Group D win away at Dinamo Zagreb, Croatia international manager Niko Kovac said: ‘If Soriano had speed he would still be at Barcelona as their starting centre-forward.’ Yet while the Salzburg striker’s stats make for frightening reading, Sky’s Spanish football expert Gerry Armstrong is not convinced. While evidently too good to play in Austria and a proven Europa League predator, former Northern Ireland and Real Mallorca star Armstrong believes Soriano is at Salzburg for a reason: he has found his level, and Cristiano Ronaldo he is not. Celtic and Scotland goalkeeper Craig Gordon described Soriano as 'very dangerous' ‘He’s a very skilful player but there are dozens of Jonathan Sorianos in Spain,’ said Armstrong, who famously scored the only goal of the game for Northern Ireland against hosts Spain at the 1982 World Cup. ‘I honestly see dozens of players like him all season. I was at the Valencia against Levante game at the weekend and it was 1-1 when a guy came off the bench for Levante called Jose Luis Morales. ‘Morales was on the park one minute when he ran at a couple of defenders, stepped over the ball twice and cracked in a spectacular winner from 30 yards. ‘That’s just what they produce over in Spain. Excellent forwards with great technique and goalscoring prowess, like Jonathan Soriano. ‘But, at Barcelona, you’ve got rapid players at another level like Pedro, Neymar and Suarez. ‘They’ve had to loan Cristian Tello out, who is a terrific player and a flying machine. Gerard Deulofeu, who was at Everton last season, can’t — and won’t — get in the Barca team either and he’s no slouch. Alexis, who is now at Arsenal, also had plenty pace and skill. Soriano is the only player to have scored more goals than Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo in 2014 . ‘So Barca have lots of top quality and speedy players and the simple reason Soriano is not there any more is because, good player that he is, he’s not good enough for Barca. ‘It’s one thing being able to do it in Austria and another thing to be able to do it in Spain, or at Celtic Park in front of a large and hostile crowd for that matter.’ Soriano’s former Barca B striking partner Nolito, now at Celta Vigo, was recently called into the full Spain side at the age of 28. At just one year his elder, Soriano has also been tipped in some quarters for a late first full Spain cap, but Armstrong does not believe that is likely. He added: ‘But if you are scoring goals, you are a danger and Soriano’s definitely got great pace and great technique. ‘If he gets in a one-on-one situation Celtic are in trouble. ‘But I’ve watched Celtic a few times this season and it seems to me they are improving all the time. ‘And if Celtic and Ronny Deila do their homework on Soriano, then I’m sure they will be fine and they will get the result they need to go through.’ Soriano will be setting his sights on Celtic on Thursday in their Europa League clash at Parkhead .","Jonathan Soriano has scored more goals than Cristiano Ronaldo in 2014 .

"New direction: Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi believes the all illegal immigrants should be given an amnesty to remain in the country . All illegal immigrants in Britain should be granted an amnesty to stay in the country, a Tory MP has said. Nadhim Zahawi, MP for Stratford-Upon-Avon, argued that the move makes sense economically and that a 'seismic' shift in policy is needed for the Conservatives to attract votes among minority groups. But it would represent a major switch in political direction for the party. Earlier this week Chancellor George Osborne announced that immigrants who claim benefits will have to learn English or see their handouts docked. Mr Zahawi told The Independent: 'We shouldn't be afraid to think outside our comfort zone. Our failure to appeal to ethnic minorities should send loud alarm bells ringing in Downing Street and Central Office. 'Unless we act now this electoral penalty will only get worse.' The Tories won just 16 per cent of the non-white vote at the election in 2010. Lord Ashcroft is among those who has told David Cameron he must do more to woo the ethnic vote. He recently released details of a . poll showing that ethnic minority voters share the Tory creed that ‘if . you work hard, it is possible to be very successful in Britain’. But when asked which party shares their values, they opt for Labour by a margin of more than two to one. The offer of an . amnesty to illegal immigrants was a manifesto pledge of the Lib Dems at . the last election but was dramatically ditched by leader Nick Clegg . earlier this year. He said the policy risked undermining public confidence in the . entire immigration system. Conflict: London Mayor Boris Johnson, left, is a long-term supporter of an amnesty for illegal immigrants but Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, right, recently ditched his party's support for the policy . The Deputy Prime Minister instead . unveiled new plans to force foreigners arriving in Britain from ‘high . risk countries’ to pay a bond of more than £1,000 which will only be . repaid when they leave. However, the London Mayor Boris Johnson has been a long-term supporter of an amnesty for an estimated half a million immigrants in the UK. Mr Johnson claims an amnesty would help the economy and the Treasury . by allowing huge numbers of illegal immigrants to work openly and to pay . tax and national insurance - a position supported by some union bosses . and church leaders. A study commissioned by Mr Johnson from the . London School of Economics estimates there are 618,000 illegal . immigrants in the UK, of which 442,000  - almost three quarters - live . in the capital. But other senior Tories have said that such an offer would send out a message to immigrants that it is possible to enter the country illegally and stay forever. Sir Andrew Green, of the campaign group MigrationWatch, said opinion . polls showed 70 per cent of the public oppose an immigration amnesty.","Nadhim Zahawi says amnesty makes political and economic sense .

"These are the two brave little battlers who have both beaten eye cancer. Identical twins Isla and Grace Devine have both undergone a mammoth battle for survival after both being diagnosed with the deadly disease just twelve months after they were born. They have undergone gruelling treatment and Grace has lost one eye - but both have come out the other side smiling. Laura Pollard and Alan Devine with their twin daughters Isla and Grace, who have both beaten eye cancer . Mother Laura Pollard, 25, said: ‘It was such an unlucky thing to happen, that both the twins had eye cancer. But we feel incredibly lucky to be in this position now. ‘It’s incredible to see what they have been through - and they have both come through the other side.' Ms Pollard, who lives with partner Alan Devine, 38, a train guard, in Morpeth, Northumberland, had been thrilled when she discovered she was pregnant with twins. She said: ‘I’m a twin myself, but I never imagined that I would fall pregnant with twins myself. When the sonographer said she could see two heartbeats on the scan, it was such a surprise.’ Her pregnancy went smoothly and she gave birth to twins Isla, weighing 6Ib2, and Grace, weighing 5Ib11, at Wansbeck General hospital in Ashington, in December 2011. Isla and Grace receive monthly checkups and recent tests show the tumours are dormant in both the girls . But when . the twins were celebrating their first birthday, she took a photo of . them and noticed that Grace’s left eye wasn’t quite straight. She . mentioned it to her health visitor and asked for a referral for a . hospital check up. She . was referred to the opthamology department at the local hospital, who . referred her for more tests at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in . Newcastle. She said: ‘I knew that something wasn’t quite right with Grace’s eye, but I never imagined it would be anything serious.’ The . consultant who carried out the tests on Grace said that he had seen . something behind her eye and wanted to examine her further under a . general anaesthetic. The operation was carried out the . following morning and then doctors broke the devastating news to the . couple that Grace had retinoblastoma, a childhood eye cancer. ‘We were completely stunned. We had never even heard of this eye . cancer, and we had never imagined that it could be anything like . cancer.  At that point it never occurred to us that Isla could have it . as well - we were only thinking of how Grace was going to get through . it.’ Further . tests showed that Grace had multiple tumours in her left eye and they . were graded E, the most serious form of the disease. She was blind in . that eye and had been for months. She also had tumors in her right eye . too. Doctors told the couple that they had to make a heart rendering . decision. The only way to save Grace’s life was to remove her eye. Isla pictured with her father Alan Devine and at hospital during her chemotherapy treatment for eye cancer. She was diagnosed with the disease in an earlier stage than her sister and it was treated with chemotherapy . ‘It was devastating for her to lose her eye. But it was the only way to save her life. It was the worst decision we have had to make, but there was no choice. It was her eye or her life.’ A week later, in April last year, the operation was carried out at Birmingham Children’s Hospital, and she had a metal implant put in. The following day Isla was checked by doctors, and they made the devastating discovery that she had eye cancer too, in both her eyes. Retinoblastoma - cancer of the retina - is a rare type of eye cancer which usually affects children younger than five. The disease causes the retina cells to grow quickly and out-of-control. While treating it usually involves laser treatment, freezing the tumour or heat therapy, larger tumours can require chemotherapy, or surgery to remove the eye. However, more than 98 per cent of children with retinoblastoma are successfully treated.

She underwent six months of chemotherapy which finished in September. Ms Pollard said: ‘She coped really well. She was sick and exhausted and she lost her hair. But she managed to come through it.

The tumours are dormant and they do have monthly check-ups. ‘They have so much more energy now, Isla especially now she has finished her chemotherapy. ‘It was such a relief that I asked the health visitor to check Grace when I did, because it wouldn’t have been picked up otherwise. And having Grace treated has saved Isla too. ‘When I look at the two of them together it’s very emotional, knowing what they have been through. And I feel like the luckiest mum in the world to have them both with me.’ Mr Devine added: ‘it’s wonderful that both the girls have come through the other side of eye cancer. It was frightening when they were first diagnosed with it. To have them both battle through it has been extremely difficult. But thankfully both the girls are now doing really well. We are very proud of them both. The family have been supported by the Childhood Eye Cancer Trust.

"Militant union chief Bob Crow last night defended his six-figure salary, declaring he was 'serving civilisation' in his role . Militant union chief Bob Crow last night defended his six-figure salary, declaring he was ‘serving civilisation’ in his role. When asked about his £145,000 pay packet the RMT boss, whose tenure has been marked by a series of rail and tube strikes, insisted he was ‘worth it’. Mr Crow came under fire during an interview for living in a housing association home in North London despite his high earnings. But when questioned over the salary, he told BBC Radio Four: ‘I am worth it, yeah. Our members, in the main, have had pay rises every single year right the way through austerity.’ On MPs’ pay, he added: ‘Anyone in the public sector, we are all civil servants, we are serving civilisation. 'That is what a civil servant does, and they should be paid accordingly. I do believe they [MPs] should have a pay rise.’ Challenged over his decision to remain a council tenant, he told BBC Radio Four’s PM programme: ‘I’m the only person in my road paying the rent - everyone else is on social. 'Every single person down my road - because there are only nine houses - is on benefits. ‘Who really is the mug?’ Last year Mr Crow claimed he had ‘no moral duty at all’ to move out of his rented council house, despite suggestions from ministers that wealthy tenants should quit to free up space for the poor. Mr Crow, who was interviewed over a three-course lunch at Westminster’s fashionable Inn the Park restaurant, claimed to be a ‘communist socialist’ who believed in ‘a society that is based on need rather than greed’. He also backed controversial plans to hand MPs an 11 per cent pay rise, saying they should not have to ‘live in a tent.’ David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg have all condemned plans to increase MPs’ pay to £74,000 after the 2015 election. But Mr Crow said: ‘Anyone in the public sector - we are all civil servants, we are serving civilisation. That is what a civil servant does, and they should be paid accordingly. I do believe they [MPs] should have a pay rise. ‘Some people might think that these MPs should live in a tent, they should have four to a room. ‘I . want my MP, particularly those who don’t live in London who’ve got to . travel down into work in London, to have decent accommodation to go home . to. I want them to have a proper meal, I don’t want them to scramble . around the place. Last year Mr Crow claimed he had 'no moral duty at all' to move out of his rented council house, despite suggestions from ministers that wealthy tenants should quit to free up space for the poor . ‘I do believe that the MPs should be paid adequately because what you will get, in my view, is a lot of people not going into parliament because they’ll say that we’re going to lose out.’ Asked about his own salary, which he suggested was closer to £90,000 before his pension and other benefits are included, he said: ‘I am worth it, yeah. Our members, in the main, have had pay rises every single year right the way through austerity. They have got good pensions, good holidays. They could be better...’ His comments are likely to infuriate commuters, who have faced severe disruption from RMT strikes designed to protect and boost the pay and conditions of Mr Crow’s members.","Bob Crow declared he was ‘serving civilisation’ in his role as RMT boss .

"Liverpool are ready to spend £100million in a transfer window for the first time in their history as Brendan Rodgers continues the revamp of his squad. Rodgers has already paid out £57million to sign Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana, Lazar Markovic and Emre Can but he has a further £75million in his kitty after selling Luis Suarez to Barcelona and intends to use that money to add another four, possibly five, new faces. The Liverpool manager wants his squad to have class and depth and is adamant he will be able to attract top talent despite Alexis Sanchez rejecting a move to Anfield in favour of Arsenal – a decision Rodgers says was based purely on the Chilean’s desire to live in London. Ready to spend: Rodgers has already purchased over £50m of talent this summer and is still in the market . Joining the club: Adam Lallana and Lazar Markovic have joined the likes of Coutinho to support Sturridge . Sanchez . would have been an outstanding acquisition but Rodgers has other ideas . of how he can replace the 31 goals Suarez scored last season and Queens . Park Rangers forward Loic Remy is a serious option to come in and work . alongside Lambert and Daniel Sturridge. A . move for Swansea’s Wilfried Bony looks unlikely due to the player’s . financial demands but Rodgers and his recruitment team will continue to . explore options so that Liverpool have the right balance ahead of . campaign in which they will return to the Champions League. ‘The . signings we have made have absolutely no relation to Luis going – these . were players that were always earmarked to come in,’ Rodgers explained. ‘We . felt last year we never had the depth; we are in the Champions' League . this year so we have to ensure we have a strong as squad as possible. ‘Obviously Luis going gives us the clout to go and spend more and we are getting the right type of player in. Arrivals: Lallana (left), Markovic (right) and Lambert (below) have already been brought in . VIDEO Lovren criticises Saints over Liverpool bid .

'Lots of players are really impressed by what we are doing as club and really excited about coming to Liverpool. ‘It . was not lack of ambition from the club (that Sanchez went to Arsenal).

Rodgers knows he has to replace the goals and creativity that Suarez provided last year . Suarez’s . sale leaves Daniel Sturridge as Liverpool’s first choice forward – the . England international will return to training next week on the . pre-season tour of the United States – but Rodgers doesn’t want his team . to be too reliant on one source of goals. ‘In the times Daniel has played up there without Luis, he has shown his qualities,’ Rodgers said. ‘But . the onus is not really on one player.

"The Fox News Channel is outraged over new revelations that three of its reporting staffers were targeted by the U.S. Department of Justice in criminal investigations related to their attempts to obtain information from government sources. James Rosen, the network's chief Washington correspondent, has become a First Amendment cause celebre over his treatment by the Obama administration. But the DOJ, Fox says, also investigated the Emmy Award-winning investigative reporter William La Jeunesse and Fox News producer Mike Levine. Rosen, according to affidavits filed by FBI agents, was considered a possible criminal co-conspirator. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Fox News's Shannon Bream (R) and Megyn Kelly (L) broke the news Monday that the DOJ had targeted three of their journalist colleagues in criminal investigations for seeking classified information from willing government sources . The Washington Post reported Monday morning that Rosen was the subject of a Department of Justice probe in relation to his reporting about North Korea's likely reactions to new UN sanctions in 2009. Federal investigators read his personal emails, obtained his phone records, and tracked his comings and goings through government buildings. An FBI agent filed an affidavit in that case claiming that he thought Rosen had broken the law, 'at the very least, either as an aider, abetter and/or co-conspirator.' None of the three journalists targeted by the Obama administration was notified that the government was spying on his records and emails. 'All three of our colleagues say they were never contacted by the government,' Fox News Channel correspondent Shannon Bream reported on Monday afternoon. James Rosen (L) attracted the Justice Department's attention in 2009 when he reported on North Korea's plans to engage in additional nuclear tests following new UN sanctions. William La Jeunesse (R) broke news about Operation Fast and Furious, allegedly with the help of willing informants from inside the U.S. government . La Jeunesse and Levine were targeted in a separate Department of Justice investigation into leaks related to Operation Fast and Furious, a scandal-plagued DOJ program that sent illicit guns across the Mexican border to drug cartels in the hope of tracing the guns' path to the narcotics gangs. The federal government lost track of the majority of approximately 2,000 firearms that were allowed to cross the southern U.S. border. More than 300 deaths in Mexico, and the death of at least one U.S. Border Patrol agent, were linked to those weapons. La Jeunesse broke stories outlining . several key elements of the Fast and Furious scandal. Monday's Inspector . General report from the DOJ directly quotes his emails, as well as some . from Levine, the Fox News producer. 'What we don't know at this point,' Bream reported, . 'is if the sources within the Justice Department may have shared those . emails with investigators, or if the Fox employees' accounts were . directly accessed by investigators. It's simply a question we cannot . answer at this point.' Fox News Channel producer Mike Levine's emails were read by DOJ investigators, but his employer isn't certain whether it was the result of a subpoena, or of agents swapping information inside Main Justice . Fox News Channel released a pointed statement from executive vice president of news editorial . Michael Clemente. 'We are outraged to learn today that . James Rosen was named a criminal co-conspirator for simply doing his job . as a reporter,' Clemente said. 'In fact, it is downright . chilling.' 'We will unequivocally defend his right to operate as a member of what up until now has always been a free press.' The news broke as White House Press . Secretary Jay Carney was preparing to deliver his daily briefing to . reporters, but with correspondents away from their television sets and . unaware of the development, questions focused on the first incarnation . of the Obama administration's press freedom scandal, involving the . Associated Press. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney fended off questions about the press freedom scandal on Monday, claiming President Obama aims to balance the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution with the need to protect state secrets . Attorney General Eric Holder has denied having any knowledge of a probe in his agency that saw the phone records of approximately 20 AP employees turned over to federal investigators who sought to determine who had leaked information about the CIA's role in a foiled terror plot in Yemen. Holder claimed in a congressional hearing last week that he had recused himself from the investigation since he himself was interviewed as a possible suspect or witness. Carney has denied that Obama was informed about that probe, and said Monday that the president 'is committed to the press's ability to pursue information and protecting the First Amendment. Obama is 'also mindful,' he added, 'of secret and classified information needing to stay secret and classified for national security reasons.'","Inspector General report found agents read emails, tracked phone records .

"Dozens of Iraqi terrorists who targeted U.S. troops could be living off government benefits on U.S. soil after they were allowed into the country as 'war refugees,' it has been revealed. The terrorism arrests of two Iraqis in Kentucky in May 2011 convinced federal authorities that some of the refugees who moved to the United States had fought against the U.S. in the Iraq War - and still wanted to kill Americans. FBI agents are now working around the clock to dust every insurgent bomb . recovered in Iraq for fingerprints to check them against the database of . 70,000 Iraqi refugees who settled here. Gregory Carl, director of the FBI's Terrorist Explosive Device Analytical Center, told ABC News that his lab has identified 'dozens' of Iraqi refugees whose fingerprints potentially match the prints found on IEDs. Scroll down for video . Two Iraqi refugees in Kentucky, Waad Ramadan Alwan and Mohanad Shareef Hammadi, were caught on video in an FBI sting after they tried to send heavy weapons to al-Qaeda in Iraq. They are seen here handling a rocket launcher (left) and a machine gun (right) 'I wouldn't be surprised if there were many more than that. And these are trained terrorists in the art of bombmaking that are inside the United States,'  Congressman Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, told ABC. 'And quite frankly, from a homeland security perspective, that really concerns me.' The Kentucky case of Waad Ramadan Alwan, 32 and Mohanad Shareef Hammadi, 26, taught the FBI that Iraqi terrorists had been settled in the United States - despite both men having had documented run-ins with Americans forces in Iraq. Alwan and Hammadi both bragged during a federal sting that they had fought against American soldiers. As part of the investigation, they were caught on video handling heavy weapons like machine guns and rocket launchers. Both men had also been arrested and fingerprinted in Iraq by American soldiers, ABC reports. Despite this - a background check to let them in the country came back 'clean.' Arrested: Waad Ramadan Alwan, 32 (left) and Mohanad Shareef Hammadi, 26 (right) were both convicted on terrorism charges after they were allowed to settle in the U.S. as Iraq War refugees . Unfortunately your browser does not support IFrames. When the men were arrested they were living in public housing and collecting government assistance checks in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Alwan boasted that he'd built at least a dozen bombs in Iraq and had killed U.S. troops with a sniper rifle - claiming that he 'had them for lunch and dinner.' In 2012, nearly a year after the FBI arrested the two suspects after working with an undercover informant to ship dummy weapons to al-Qaeda fighters in Iraq, the  Terrorist Explosive Device Analytical Center discovered Alwan's fingerprints on a bomb recovered in Iraq in 2005. The print was on a cordless phone base station that had been attached to 'three homemade-explosive artillery rounds concealed by gravel with protruding wires' that U.S. troops had discovered in Bayji on a patrol. Alwan had drawn a model for a similar explosive for the undercover informant. He even had talked about tracking down a U.S. Army officer who had given Alwan trouble when he was fighting the Americans in Iraq.","FBI agents combing through 100,000 IEDs recovered in Iraq to determine if any fingerprints match database of refugees living in America .

"Israel has agreed to swap 1,000 Palestinian prisoners for a lone soldier captured by Gaza’s Islamist rulers five years ago. The deal to release Gilad Shalit resolves one of the most emotive issues in the Middle-East. Shalit, then 19, was captured by militants who tunnelled their way out of Gaza and forced him back over the border in 2006. Verge of freedom: Captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit was last seen looking gaunt in this video released by Hamas in October 2009. He is due to be released from captivity 'within days' Cause celebre: Shalit was 19 when he was captured by militants who tunnelled their way out of Gaza and into Israel before forcing him back over the border in 2006 . Israel's government approved the deal following a three-hour debate after which both Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal announced the agreement in televised comments. Mr Netanyahu said Schalit would return home within days. Mr Mashaal, portraying the agreement as a victory, said the Palestinian prisoners would be freed in two stages over two months. Mr Netanyahu added: 'There is built-in tension between the desire to return a kidnapped soldier... and the need to preserve the security of the citizens of Israel. 'I believe we reached the best deal that we can reach at this time, a stormy time in the Middle-East.' A source involved in the talks said the discussions had been mediated by Egypt. The pact is virtually certain to improve the climate for restarting peace talks that have been stalled for over a year. Overjoyed: Shalit's parents Aviva (left) and Noam (right) last night react to the news of their son's impending release in a protest tent set up outside the Prime Minister's residence in Jerusalem . Brother in arms: Yoel Shalit (left) is hugged by friends as news of the deal filters through . Timeline: Shalit was captured over five years ago . But . it gives Hamas, the militant group that rules the Gaza Strip, a victory . that might strengthen its hand against the more moderate Palestinian . president Mahmoud Abbas, whose Palestinian Authority runs the West Bank. Mr . Mashaal said 1,000 men and 27 women prisoners would be released, the . first 450 over the next week and the rest within two months. He said . they would include 315 prisoners serving life sentences, suggesting they . were convicted of attacks that caused the deaths of Israelis. Seeming to confirm Israel's fears, Mr Mashaal said that those who are released 'will return to ... the national struggle'. 'This is a national achievement for the whole Palestinian people,' he said. In . the northern Gaza town of Jebaliya, thousands of Hamas supporters . flocked the streets, led by masked militants. Thousands of other Gazans . rushed to their border with Egypt, clutching Palestinian and Egyptian . flags, tossing flowers and cheering. The exchange is sure to be greeted with relief by both sides. A . campaign by Shalit’s family has made him a cause celebre in Israel . and his release a test for Mr Netanyahu’s government. The Palestinians . have long clamoured for the release of hundreds they consider political . prisoners. Israeli . television quoted Mr Netanyahu as telling Shalit’s parents that ever . since he took office three years ago 'I’ve been waiting for the chance . to make this telephone call' to inform them of the deal. The . wife of Marwan Barghouti, a charismatic activist seen as a future . Palestinian leader, told Reuters in the West Bank that she was eagerly . awaiting word that he will be included in the prisoner swap. In Gaza, the families of men jailed for life by Israel awaited word that their names would be on the list. Celebrations: Hamas supporters celebrate the deal that will see more than a thousand Palestinian detainees freed in exchange for Shalit . Hope: The family of Hassan Salame celebrates in the expectation that the Hamas leader, imprisoned for life, will be released . The . main sticking point in earlier negotiations had been Israel’s . reluctance to meet Hamas’ demands to free prisoners convicted of . involvement in lethal attacks against Israelis. Israel . has carried out several lopsided prisoner swaps in the past, notably in . 1985 when hundreds of Palestinian prisoners were freed in exchange for . several soldiers captured by a guerilla group in Lebanon. The . ordeal of Shalit, a fresh-faced corporal, transfixed Israel after . the tank gunner was captured by militants who tunnelled their way out of . Gaza and then forced him back over the border. He was 19 at the time and had begun his mandatory three-year army service nearly a year previously. For Hamas, the deal is a victory that might strengthen its hand against the more moderate Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas, whose Palestinian Authority runs the West Bank . Defiant gesture: Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal . Shalit, a native Israeli who also holds French citizenship, was last . seen in a videotape released by his captors in September 2009 showing . him looking pale and thin. He received no visits from the International Committee of the Red Cross, despite many appeals. Britain welcomed a deal to secure Shalit's release. Foreign . Secretary William Hague said he hoped the prisoner swap agreement . between Tel Aviv and Hamas officials would help 'build confidence and . trust'. Shalit was . captured in a cross-border raid by Palestinian militants in June 2006, . and dragged into Gaza. Little has been known about his fate since then. But . Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu announced in a televised . address last night that the deadlock on the issue had been broken. The soldier will reportedly be released in exchange for 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. Egyptian and German diplomats are believed to have played a significant role in the negotiations. Mr . Hague said: 'I welcome the agreement between Israel and Hamas to . release Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit, next month as part of a prisoner . exchange. 'Holding him in captivity has been utterly unjustified from the beginning and yet it has gone on for five long years. Symbol for both sides: A Palestinian man walks in front of a wall painting depicting Shalit in Jebaliya, northern Gaza Strip . 'We have always called for his unconditional release. We are pleased that this long overdue development is finally taking place. 'Mr Shalit’s long captivity has been painful for his family and I hope that he will be reunited with them as soon as possible.

"Scrapped: Lib Dem health minister Norman Lamb will announce the end of the Liverpool Care Pathway today . Ministers decided to scrap the Liverpool Care Pathway after a damning inquiry found frail and vulnerable patients were so dehydrated they were desperately sucking on wet sponges. A shocking catalogue of abuse found that some relatives were forced to give their loved ones water secretly when the nurse was out of the room – because medical staff had forbidden it. The review by Baroness Neuberger, extracts from which have been seen by the Daily Mail, found examples of patients being so heavily drugged that they could ‘never communicate again’, meaning their grief-stricken families never got to say goodbye. And some claimed their relatives had been given a ‘chemical cosh’ cocktail of drugs, with the express intent of hastening their deaths from dehydration. As the Mail reported on Saturday, Lib Dem health minister Norman Lamb will announce today that the controversial pathway, under which life-saving treatment is removed if a person is deemed close to death, will be scrapped within 12 months. Every year, 130,000 patients have been placed on the pathway, which usually involves heavy sedation with morphine or similar drugs. The Mail has been leading a campaign against it, highlighting examples of doctors putting patients on the pathway without asking for consent. We also revealed how some hospitals were being paid six-figure ‘bribes’ to meet targets about the numbers of patients on the LCP – leading to fears that doctors were put under pressure to use the pathway. Following our revelations, Mr Lamb asked Baroness Neuberger to carry out a review into the controversial pathway – in the face of opposition from the medical establishment. The report, More Care – Less Pathway, says that although the LCP was working well in many places, there were too many examples of abuse for it to continue. It will be replaced with more individualised care packages, and all incentive payments to hospitals will be scrapped. Damning: Baroness Neuberger carried out a review into how the LCP was implemented . Under the pathway, nurses use wet sponges to moisten the mouths of dying patients after food and drink is withdrawn. The fact that some patients were seen sucking on the sponges indicates that they were very uncomfortable and were desperate for water – and perhaps not as close to inevitable death as thought. It raises uncomfortable memories of Mid Staffs hospital, where a patient on an understaffed A&E was so dehydrated he was forced to drink from a vase. The report concludes that in too many cases, the LCP is used as a ‘tick-box exercise’ rather than looking at what the dying patients actually need. ‘Some (people) talked about . their relatives sucking on the sponges that they had been given to wet . the patient’s mouth in an attempt to get fluid, when fluids had been . deliberately withheld.’ - Report by Baroness Neuberger into the Liverpool Care Pathway . ‘Where care is already poor, the pathway is sometimes used as a tick-box exercise, and good care for the dying patient or their relatives or cares may be absent,’ the report says. ‘Whether true or not, many families suspected that deaths had been hastened by over-prescription of strong painkilling drugs or sedatives.’ Baroness Neuberger spoke to dozens of people about the care their loved ones had received during their final hours. Some reported ‘disobeying instructions from medical staff to withhold fluids’ – instead secretly giving them water when the nurse had left the room. The report says: ‘Some talked about their relatives sucking on the sponges that they had been given to wet the patient’s mouth in an attempt to get fluid, when fluids had been deliberately withheld.’ It finds that in many cases, opiates were given in too strong a dose, making the patient ‘too drowsy and confused to be able to communicate and ask for water’. And it adds: ‘There was a feeling that the drugs had been used as a “chemical cosh” that reduced people’s desire to accept food or drink. ‘There have been too many coming . forward to the review panel to say they left their loved one in a calm . and peaceful state, able to communicate, for a short time, or with a . doctor or a nurse for a check-up only to return and find a syringe . driver had been put in place and their loved one was never able to . communicate again. ‘One family was left with the impression that their relative had been overmedicated so that he would die from dehydration.’ The Daily Mail has led the way in exposing shocking cases of abuse of vulnerable people on the Liverpool Care Pathway. Here are some of the chilling examples: . OLIVE GOOM, 85 . Olive Goom died alone aged 85 after hospital staff failed to tell her family she was being put on the pathway . Olive Goom, 85, died alone at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital after doctors failed to tell relatives they were ending her life. Staff reassured relatives on the phone just hours before her death in February 2011 that there was no urgent need to visit – even though doctors had already removed tubes providing vital food and fluids. Her family discovered that she had died only when her niece, Marion Hebbourne, went to visit her and found she was already being prepared for the mortuary. THOMAS JAMES, 90 . Thomas James died on the LCP at home after he was given sedatives . The family of former soldier Thomas James said he was put on the pathway at his home without consulting them. The 90-year-old, who lived near Braintree in Essex, had cancer but insisted he was not ready to die until after his granddaughter’s wedding. But his family said he died at home in October last year after he was given sedatives by a district nurse. The next day they were unable to wake him to give him food or drink and he fell into a diabetic coma. ANDY FLANAGAN, 48 . Andy Flanagan was 'rescued' from the care pathway and lived for another five weeks . Andy Flanagan, 48, was said to be severely brain damaged and close to death after a cardiac arrest. His family gathered at his bedside last June to say their goodbyes at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King’s Lynn, Norfolk, after it withdrew fluids and said it was going to let him ‘slip away’. But when Mr Flanagan’s sister, who is a nurse, gently moved him to change his bloodstained sheets, he started to murmur words. Every ten minutes relatives gave him drops of water before doctors eventually agreed to put him back on a drip. He was able to return home, lived for another month and was able to say farewell to his loved ones. His sisters called the LCP a ‘licence to kill’. Announcing the decision to scrap the LCP in the Mail on Saturday, Mr Lamb said any replacement will definitely not be called a ‘pathway’. ‘I took the decision to launch this review because concerns were raised with me about how patients were being cared for and how families were being treated during this difficult and sensitive time,’ he said. ‘We need a whole new system of better end of life care tailored to the needs of individual patients and involving their families.’ It emerged late last year that as many as 60,000 of the patients placed on the scheme were never asked for their consent, or their families were not asked. Many found out by accident, and others recovered fully after relatives found out and got their loved ones taken off the pathway. Any new system will ensure that patients and relatives are properly consulted.","Review of Liverpool Care Pathway by Baroness Neuberger was damning .

"Officers with a finger on the trigger of the Air Force's most powerful nuclear missiles are complaining of a wide array of morale-sapping pressures, according to internal emails. The complaints shed fresh light on dissatisfactions affecting the critical arm of the Air Force, an undercurrent that has captured the attention of the service's leaders. Key themes among the complaints include working under 'poor leadership' and being stuck in 'dead-end careers' in nuclear weapons, one email said. Crews from the 91st Missile Wing at Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota (pictured) made the complaints in an unpublished study . The sentiments were expressed privately by members of the 91st Missile Wing at Minot Air Force Base, N.D., in an unpublished study for the Air Force. The complaints also said there was a need for more experienced missile officers, a less arduous work schedule and 'leaders who will listen.' Taken together, the complaints suggest sagging morale in arguably the most sensitive segment of the American military. The 91st at Minot operates 150 intercontinental ballistic missiles—one-third of the entire ICBM force. The missiles stand in underground silos on constant alert for launch within minutes of a presidential order. In the nuclear missile business, morale is not a trivial matter. Mental state is treated as a vital sign - like physical health, criminal record and technical know-how - that must be monitored to indicate whether an individual is fit to be trusted with weapons of such destructive power. The question of morale at Minot coincides with trouble inside the ranks of the 91st. The Associated Press reported on May 8 . that 17 launch crew members - representing about 10 per cent of the . launch crew force - had been taken off duty for remedial training . following a poor showing in a key portion of an inspection. The . story was based on an April 12 internal Air Force email that said the . 91st suffered from 'rot' within its ranks, including tolerance of . weapons safety rules violations. Air Force leaders told Congress the . problem was less about poor performance than about poor attitude. Pictured: A Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile. Crews at the base operate 150 missiles - one third of the entire force . Last week the Air Force said two . additional launch officers at Minot had been sidelined, for a total of . 19. An Air Force spokesman, Lt. Col. Ronald Watrous, said that 10 of the . 19 had completed the two-month process of regaining certification. Most of the rest are expected to do so by the end of this month. The AP obtained a second internal Air Force email describing morale issues at Minot, which were hinted at broadly in the first email. Both notes were written by Lt. Col. Jay Folds, deputy commander of the unit in charge of the 91st's three missile squadrons at Minot. The second Folds email, dated March 21, said complaints were registered in a confidential study initiated by the Air Force's most senior officer, Gen. Mark Welsh, who was considering 'solutions to our problems.' The study was done between December 2012 and February 2013 by the Rand Corp., a federally funded think tank that Welsh enlisted to study workforce issues inside the three missile wings, including the one at Minot. The email briefly summarized complaints at Minot; it did not refer to what people at the other two missile wings—at F.E. Warren Air Force Base, Wyo., and Malmstrom Air Force Base, Mont.—told the researchers. The Air Force confirmed to the AP that Folds and his immediate superior, Col. Bryan Haderlie, are leaving their posts, but Watrous, spokesman for the Air Force Global Strike Command, said both are being moved in a 'normal rotation.' In a telephone interview about the . Rand study and the Folds emails, Maj. Gen. Michael J. Carey, who as . commander of the 20th Air Force is responsible for all three missile . wings, acknowledged a degree of discontent at Minot but said more study . is required before he and Welsh can pinpoint all the dimensions of the . issue. Asked about the complaints about weak leadership, Carey said on May 31, 'I certainly take it to heart.' Carey, . who was briefed on Rand's findings on March 20, said that despite the . various complaints, morale at Minot is 'not bad.' He said that on a . recent visit to the 91st he found missile crews optimistic and upbeat. Members from Minot (pictured a B-52 Stratofortress from the base) complained the job is a 'dead end career' 'They are not unhappy,' he said. Carey said some complaints are rooted in a lack of communication from . higher headquarters about plans for modernizing the nuclear force even . as the Air Force faces tighter budgets. Carey . said he could not provide a copy of Rand's findings because they have . not yet been presented to Welsh. The study was based on interviews with . missile launch officers as well as enlisted airmen who support that . work. In the earlier email obtained by the AP, Folds said there was 'such rot' within the force that launch officers tolerated weapons safety rule violations, possible violations of missile launch codes and other failings deemed unacceptable. The AP story based on that email . triggered strong responses from some in Congress, including Sen. Dick . Durbin, D-Ill., who wondered aloud what lay behind the turmoil inside . the missile force. Part of . the answer, in the view of many experts, is the shrinking role and size . of the U.S. nuclear force and, consequently, a reduced sense of purpose . among launch crews who do 24-hour shifts in control centers buried deep . below ground. The U.S. has . 450 deployed ICBMs, down from about 1,000 at the end of the Cold War, . and current projections call for only 420 within five years. Some have . argued for eliminating the missiles altogether. Many experts say the seemingly low morale is due to the shrinking role and size of the U.S. nuclear force (pictured a A16C6C Titan II ICBM Intercontinental Ballistic Missile at Missile Museum Green Valley Arizona) Hans Kristensen, a nuclear weapons . expert at the Federation of American Scientists, said that ICBM launch . crew officers have told him over a period of years that morale has been . on the decline. 'You can't . take away the fact that the mission they sit and wait for [to launch a . nuclear attack] is very unlikely to ever happen,' Kristensen said. 'That . affects career choices and morale because they talk to their other Air . Force buddies who come home after flying B-52s over Afghanistan or Iraq . and it's very exciting to be in that part of the Air Force [while the . ICBM launch crews] sit in a hole in the Midwest and wait for nothing.' A Pentagon advisory panel report two years ago cited multiple aspects of a morale problem within the nuclear force. It said the Air Force's traditional emphasis on fighter and bomber operations leaves nuclear officers feeling marginalized, all the more because their work is out of public view and veiled in secrecy. 'They perceive a lack of knowledge of and respect for their mission from within the larger Air Force,' the panel reported. Robert L. Goldich, a military affairs expert formerly with the Congressional Research Service, said the Air Force faces a difficult task in attracting and keeping high-quality officers to fill the missile launch crew positions. 'They can of course assign new second lieutenants involuntarily, as any service does, but that wouldn't exactly create high esprit de corps in a component of the Air Force that just seems less and less relevant—and, importantly, is virtually unknown to the American public,' Goldich said in an email exchange.","Members of the 91st Missile Wing at Minot Air Force Base made complaints in unpublished study for the Air Force .

"Projecting unity on Russia, President . Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel put their differences over the U.S.'s spying program aside on Friday and threatened tougher and . broader new sanctions against Moscow if it doesn't . quickly change its disruptive behavior in Ukraine. 'We . will not have a choice but to move forward with additional more-severe . sanctions' if Russia disrupts a presidential election in Ukraine . scheduled for May 25, Obama said at a news conference with Merkel . outside the White House early Friday afternoon. 'Further sanctions will be unavoidable,' Merkel agreed. Scroll down for video . Agree to disagree: President Barack Obama (left) and German Chancellor Angela Merkel (right) put their differences of opinion over the U.S. spying program aside on Friday to display trans-Atlantic unity against an assertive Russia . This was the first time the two world leaders had met since the Edward Snowden document leak that revealed the U.S. National Security Agency had been listening to Merkel's personal cell phone calls for more than a decade. In October, Obama promised that the U.S. was no longer hacking her personal calls. That courtesy does not apply to other residents of Germany, including other German officials, however. The issue has aggravated German citizens, prompting . calls for Berlin to strike some type of agreement with Washington to . limit U.S. surveillance on German soil. Germany had hoped to get the U.S. to enter into a no-spy agreement with the country before today's meeting, but talks fell apart, The New York Times reports. 'What the Germans want, and wanted, is that we would never do anything . against their laws on their territory,' a senior administration official told the Times. That's an agreement the U.S. 'has with no country.' 'There’s no country where we have a no-spy agreement,' President Obama said in February at a press conference with French President Francois Hollande when the subject of spying on that country's citizens came up. President Obama said on Friday it . wasn't accurate to say that the United States had proposed and . then withdrawn a no-spy agreement. Instead, he said the government has . proposed the same guidelines with Germany that it maintains with other . allies including the British. He did not describe them in any detail. At a press conference the two leaders made it clear . they have differences when it comes to U.S. surveillance overseas. 'There are still some gaps that need to be worked through,'  President Obama said. Merkel was diplomatic, as well, but a shade more blunt: 'We have differences of opinion to overcome.' A German parliamentary panel probing the NSA issue . is eager to invite former NSA contractor Edward Snowden to speak to the . panel. The German government has made clear it opposes the idea of . letting Snowden, whose U.S. passport has been revoked, testify in . Berlin, drawing criticism from Snowden's opponents. This was the first time the two world leaders had met since the Edward Snowden document leak that revealed the the U.S. National Security Agency had been listening to Merkel's personal cell phone calls for more than a decade . The two leaders met as the European Union announced it would hold talks with Ukraine and Russia later this month on the price of natural gas, an attempt to avoid any disruption in supplies. Moscow recently hiked the price of gas shipped to Ukraine to $485 per thousand cubic meters from $268.50, and threatened to limit deliveries if Kiev does not meet the new price and repay a debt of $3.5 billion. More forebodingly, pro-Russia forces shot down two Ukrainian helicopters Friday and Ukraine reported many rebels dead and wounded as the interim government in Kiev launched its first major offensive against an insurgency that has seized government buildings across the east. The diplomatic deal struck two weeks ago . in Geneva has failed to de-escalate the conflict between pro-Russian . separatists in eastern Ukraine and the central government in Kiev. The . U.S. and Europe have sharply rebuked Putin for flouting his . responsibilities under the deal, and Moscow on Friday declared all hopes . for implementing the accord 'effectively destroyed' after Kiev's offensive against the insurgents. Obama said Putin is free to offer his own . views with regard to events in Ukraine, but it isn't acceptable for the . Kremlin to think 'it has veto power' over decisions made by a duly . elected government in Kiev. In their remarks, Obama and Merkel both said they would prefer the situation in Ukraine to be settled through diplomacy, but both leaders made it clear that . the next step would be to order sanctions on separate parts of the . Russian economy or military — on energy or arms for example — if Russia continued to ignore the agreement it made earlier this month with the U.S. and EU. Neither leader specified precisely what was being considered. As the crisis in Ukraine has worsened, Merkel has spoken to Putin perhaps more frequently than has any other European leader. Because of this, the U.S. sees her as a critical channel of communication, as well as a key player in the effort to prevent other EU nations from going soft on sanctions. 'There's no question that the situation in Ukraine, the continued failure by Russia to abide by its commitments in the Geneva Agreement will be a focus of the conversation,' White House spokesman Jay Carney said before the two leaders met. U.S. and German officials said ahead of the Obama-Merkel meeting that part of the discussion probably would focus on how the U.S. and Europe would coordinate harsher punishments — including sanctions targeting broad sectors of Russia's economy — should Moscow further provoke tensions in Ukraine, such as by sending military forces into restive eastern Ukraine. The White House is concerned that Europe's deep economic interests in Russia and dependence on Russian energy could deter EU nations from following through with sanctions that could ricochet onto their own economies. 'She's getting enormous pressure from German industry not to harm their interests,' said Heather Conley, a Europe expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""She has to start laying the political groundwork for this because it requires some sacrifice."" Merkel, like Obama, has ruled out military action to deter Putin from seizing more of Ukraine. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who has urged Obama to send weapons to Ukraine's government, said he planned to tell Merkel during a private meeting that he was embarrassed but unsurprised by her country's failure of leadership. 'The leaders, they're being governed by the industrial complex of Germany,' McCain said Thursday. 'They might as well have them in the government. It's shameful.' A troubled EU-U.S. trade agreement, known as the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, was also on the agenda, as well as joint efforts to deal with climate change, Syria's civil war and nuclear negotiations with Iran, said Laura Magnuson of the White House's National Security Council. Merkel will also speak to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Friday, focusing on the fledgling trade agreement and U.S.-European economic ties. President Obama says the U.S. government has proposed the same spying guidelines to Germany that it maintains with other allies including the British. He did not describe them in any detail . 'There are still some gaps that need to be worked through,' President Obama said on Friday of the U.S. and Germany's positions on the U.S.'s spying program.

"An extraordinary diagram that charts in chilling detail the outcome of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor has emerged after 72 years. The colourful battle map was drawn up in the wake of the surprise attack on the American Pacific Fleet and shows the sheer devastation inflicted. It was produced by Lieutenant Commander Mitsuo Fuchida who led the 400 Japanese fighter planes on the mission and who gave the famous radio signal 'Tora! Tora! Tora! Revealed: An extraordinary battle map that charts in chilling detail the outcome of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor . Lieutenant Commander Mitsuo Fuchida, who led the 400 Japanese fighter planes on the mission . The diagram shows more than 60 US ships at anchor in the harbor and most are marked in different symbols to show the extent of the damage they suffered. A key-code down one side records the types of munitions used and the damage inflicted, under the categories minor, moderate, serious and sunk. One of the most famous ships attacked . at Pearl Harbor was the USS Arizona. It has four red dots on it and . three red lines running through it to show it was seriously damaged. In . fact the Arizona was sunk in shallow water and was the only battleship . that couldn't be raised. It is now a permanent memorial to the 1,177 men . on board who were killed. One of the eight battleships attacked was the USS Oklahoma which has a large red cross through the middle of it to show it was sunk. Twelve red arrows pointing to its starboard side indicate the number of torpedos that struck it. Ahead of it is the USS West Virginia which also has a red cross, nine torpedo arrows and three red dots which show it was hit by three bombs. Next to that is the USS California that also has a red cross and three red dots. So detailed was the report, Lt Cmdr Fushida even added plumes of large orange flames and smoke to many of the ships for added effect. It was used by the Japanese officer during a presentation he gave to Emperor Hirohito on the successful attack three weeks later. The document is marked 'Top Secret' and is titled 'Estimated Damage Report Against Surface Ships on the Air Attack of Pearl Harbour.' The map is incredibly accurate in terms of the positions of the 60 ships and Lt Cmdr Fushida was about 80 per cent correct in his results. After the war he became a Christian evangelist and bizarrely settled in the US. He gave the document, that measures 2ft 7in by 23ins, to the historian Gordon Prange when he was interviewed by him in 1947. Mr Prange kept it for over 40 years until it was acquired by the late magazine magnate Malcolm Forbes. His family have now sold it at auction where it fetched £260,000. The battleship USS Arizona belches smoke as it topples over into the sea during the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii . Three U.S. battleships are hit from the air during the Japanese attack . Patrick McGrath, a books and manuscripts specialists at auctioneers Christie's, said: ‘It is a remarkable artefact from World War II. ‘It was very exciting to deal with such an historic document. It brings you right there at that moment in history. ‘In his autobiography, Fuchida said he felt his diagram was about 80 per cent accurate. The U.S. Navy battleship USS West Virginia burns and sinks after the Japanese attack . Smoke and flame are seen as ammunition explodes on the destroyer USS Shaw during the attack . ‘It was based on the action reports compiled on board an aircraft carrier following the attack. ‘He described unfolding the layout in front of the Emperor and using his finger to point at the relevant places on the diagram, giving a blow-by-blow account. ‘It is remarkably detailed.’ The attack on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii resulted in 2,402 U.S. servicemen being killed and almost 20 ships being sunk, destroyed or badly damaged. A picture of Pearl Harbor taken by one of the Japanese planes during the surprise attack . The Japanese believed the success of the attack would prevent the Americans from entering the war in the Pacific between Japan and China. But it had the opposite effect and the Americans were able to salvage and repair almost all of the ships that were sunk or damaged and by 1944 they were all back in use.","The diagram shows more than 60 US ships at anchor in the Hawaiian base, which was attacked on December 7, 1941 .

"French Interior minister Manuel Valls says all Roma gypsies should return to Romania or Bulgaria because they cannot integrate . A French minister has called for Roma gipsies to ‘return to Romania or  Bulgaria’ because they   don’t integrate well in France. There have also been demands from other politicians for the two impoverished countries to be ‘locked out’ of European agreements which allow freedom of movement. Interior minister Manuel Valls’s explosive words yesterday started a wide-ranging debate about the abject failure of EU ‘open border’ immigration policies. The European Commission immediately threatened sanctions against France for its policy towards the Roma community. A spokesman insisted everyone from Bulgaria and Rumania was a citizen of the EU and therefore had a right to travel anywhere. Three years ago the Commission’s vice president, Viviane Reding, sent a similar threat to former president Nicolas Sarkozy, saying that Roma expulsions had to stop. The row will be of huge interest in the UK, as next year restrictions on Romanians and Bulgarians looking for work are being swept away. In an interview on the France Inter radio station, Mr Valls said: ‘The Roma should return to Romania or Bulgaria.’ The Socialist Party member added: ‘Yes, we must tell the truth to the French – these populations have a way of life that is extremely different to ours, and they are obviously in confrontation with local populations.’ Illegal Roma camps have sprung up on the edges of major cities such as Paris and Marseille. All have become associated with widespread crime and major health hazards. Roma community members sit in a makeshift camp in Yambol, France. Mr Valls' said all Roma camps in the country should be dismantled . Mr . Valls, who was born in Barcelona, said: ‘It is unrealistic to think we . will solve the problem of Roma populations only through integration.’ He said there is ‘no alternative but to dismantle these camps and gradually move them across the border’. And . last night he remained defiant in the face of criticism, insisting: . ‘The majority [of Roma] should be delivered back to the borders. We are . not here to welcome these people. ‘I’d . remind you of [former Socialist premier] Michel Rocard’s statement . “it’s not France’s job to deal with the misery of the whole world”.’ One . of Mr Valls’s own cabinet colleagues, Arnaud Montebourg, also pointed . to the fact the minister’s family were migrants from Spain. Police and border staff wake up and move on Romanians who had set up camp in Park Lane and Marble Arch . The issue in France will be of huge interest in the UK, as Britain prepares to welcome thousands of Romanians and Bulgarians looking for work in 2014 . Mr . Montebourg said: ‘A theory that such and such a person or such and such . a people will never, ever be able to integrate just doesn’t stand up. ‘Decreeing in advance that it is impossible seems to me excessive and is worthy of being corrected.’ But Mr Valls said: ‘I’ve got nothing to correct. My remarks only shock those who don’t know the subject.’ Jean-Francois . Cope, the leader of the opposition UMP party, meanwhile told France . Info radio station that Roma criminals regularly  ‘harassed Parisians’. Referring . to the Schengen agreement which allows people to move across Europe . without passport checks, Mr Cope said both Romania and Bulgaria should . be excluded. ‘We close our . eyes to the French government to what is happening in our country – the . constant violence’, he said. ‘This is extremely serious and…it is out of . the question that Bulgaria and Romania enter the Schengen area until . the problem is resolved at the European level.’ There . are an estimated 15,000 Roma gipsies in France. Two years ago the then . interior minister, Claude Gueant, claimed the vast majority of street . robberies in Paris were carried out by Romanian immigrants.","Manuel Valls said the Roma way of life is too different for them to integrate .

"Mark Zuckerberg's famously private wife Priscilla Chan has given her first television interview, opening up about her marriage, growing up with refugee parents and her billionaire husband's trademark clothing item - hoodies. Chan, 29, revealed little has changed since she first met the Facebook founder at a Harvard University fraternity party more than a decade ago. 'He has graduated to a nicer hoodie. The main quality about this hoodie that's nicer is that it's softer, so he's really excited about that,' she said, in an exclusive interview with Today's Savannah Guthrie. 'I’m pro-hoodie. He wears a fresh hoodie every day so that pretty much meets my lowest barrier for him...I'm happy with whatever he wants to wear, as long as it's appropriate for where we're going.' While the recent medical graduate normally shuns the limelight, she has bared all for the first time in order to promote a cause dear to her heart - education. The power couple today pledged $120 . million to the San Francisco school district through their foundation, . Startup: Education, to improve technology used in the classrooms over . the next five years. Scroll down for video . Supportive partner: Priscilla Chan (left) told Today's Savannah Guthrie (right) in an exclusive interview that she didn't mind her husband Mark Zuckerberg wearing hoodies, as long as they suited the occasion . Speaking out: Mark Zuckerberg's famously private wife Priscilla Chan (pictured) has given her first television interview to Today, opening up about her marriage, dog and love of education . 'We live in Palo Alto, which has, fortunately, one of the greatest school districts in the country,' the medical resident said. 'But right next door, actually within walking distance of our home, is East Palo Alto that has a K-8 system that has a lot of unmet needs that the public school district is struggling to make up the difference for at this time.' Chan, who is training to become a pediatrician, said the education of underprivileged children is hugely important to her, as her parents were refugees (Chinese and Vietnamese) and she was the first in her family to go to college. She was an interpreter for her grandparents who didn't speak English and was encouraged to go to college by her teachers. 'My public school teachers did a great job of saying, ‘Check this out. You're qualified for this. You should explore these opportunities.' They're the ones who said, ‘You know, apply to Harvard. You might be a good fit here',' Chan, who speaks English, Cantonese and Spanish fluently, said. 'And then when I got to Harvard, it was even more opportunities that I didn't know existed. So their effects have only compounded over time.' Philanthropists: Power couple Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg have donated $120 million to the San Francisco Bay Area's public school system . Devoted: Priscilla Chan has revealed she would like to be a mom, but admitted she and husband Mark Zuckerberg treat their Hungarian sheep dog beast like a child . Chan and Zuckerberg, 30, have made philanthropy a central theme of their life together, joining Warren Buffet and Bill Gates's Giving Pledge to give away most of their wealth. However, Chan has been forced to defend the couple's $100 million donation to Newark, New Jersey's public school system, with critics saying the money has so far failed to fix the city's ailing school system. After four years, the money is nearly gone and a lot of people are angry. 'We've invested in Newark's children, the schools and teachers and these are long-term bets that need a number of years to really pan out,' Chan, the eldest of three siblings, told Today. 'We've seen and learned how important it is to listen to the community, and really get a sense of what they need and want. And it's a long journey.' Meanwhile Chan and Zuckerberg have been on their own long journey. The pair married in their Palo Alto backyard in 2012 after dating for nine years. They would like to have children, but so far are obsessed with their Hungarian sheep dog Beast, who is like their child and has his own Facebook page. Chan, however, admits her first impressions of the social network mogul weren't very good. Loved up: Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan met as Harvard classmates and dated for nearly a decade before tying the knot in May 2012 in their backyard . Fashion sense: Priscilla Chan said she supports her husband Mark Zuckerberg's love of hoodies, which he wears nearly every day . 'I thought he was just this really interesting guy, who really wasn't that studious,' she said. 'On . our first date, he told me that he'd rather go on a date with me than . finish his take-home midterm. The type-A first child in me was . appalled.' The Massachusetts native said she tried to send him home so he could finish the test, which made her beau think she wasn't interested. 'Turns out he was just trying to . convince me to spend more time with him,' she said. 'And I've since . learned that he's very bright. And his type of learning is different . than my approach to learning.' However Chan's learning standards are very high, having been voted 'class genius' in high school. 'I actually had a lot of very smart peers. The other 'class genius' is now a nuclear physicist,' she told Today. As for being described as the first lady of Facebook and the Kate Middleton of social media, the medical resident said it is cringe-worthy, and she would rather be known for her work with Bay Area schools.

Hero: Petra Kvitova said her hero was Martina Navratilova, who gave her excellent advice before Wimbledon . Which sportsman would you like to be? If I’m allowed to choose a man it would be Jaromir Jagr, the Czech ice hockey legend who plays for New Jersey Devils. Career highlight? Winning Wimbledon for the second time. It was a bit more special showing myself that I could do it again after the first one. ... And the worst moment? Losing in the first round of the Australian Open this year. I was convinced I was going to do well there and had really high hopes so it was extra disappointing. If your house was burning down, what one possession would you save? To be honest nothing special, it would be my passport or my phone. Highlight: Kvitova sad her career highlight was winning Wimbledon for a second time . What’s the best advice you’ve ever been given?

The B53 was capable of releasing nine megatons of energy – 600 times more than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945. On explosion, the 9,000lb ‘bunker buster’ would have caused lethal burns to anyone within 18 miles, destroyed all buildings within nine miles and was even able to penetrate up to 230m underground. But the last one was taken apart yesterday at America’s only nuclear weapons facility, the Pantex plant near Amarillo in Texas. Last B53: The 10,000lb bomb will be dismantled at the Pantex Plant just outside Amarillo, Texas . The completion of the dismantling program is a year ahead of schedule, according to the U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration, and aligns with President Barack Obama's goal of reducing the number of nuclear weapons. Thomas D'Agostino, the nuclear administration's chief, called the bomb's elimination a 'significant milestone'. First put into service in 1962, when Cold War tensions peaked during the Cuban missile crisis, the B53 weighed 10,000lbs and was the size of a minivan. It was kept airborne on B52 bombers round the clock until 1968 as a nuclear deterrent against the Soviet Union. Hans Kristensen, director of the organisation's Nuclear Information Project: 'It’s the end of the era of monster weapons, if you will. Decommissioned: Workers unload the B53 bomb at the Pantex Plant near Amarillo . End of an era: Production technicians conduct a training class on the B53 bomb before it is dismantled . Signed, sealed, delivered: Obama and Medvedev shake hands over historic deal to reduce nuclear arms . Height of the Cold War: A long line of Soviet Army rockets move into Moscow's Red Square towards St Basil's Cathedral during a parade marking the 46th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia in 1963 . The Hiroshima bomb, nicknamed 'Little Boy', released a mix of shockwaves, heat rays and radiation, killing thousands instantly. Around 600 to 860 milligrams of matter in the bomb was converted into the active energy of heat and radiation. It exploded with an energy between 13 and 18 kilotons of TNT. In comparison, the B53 had 9,000 kilotons of explosives on board. According to figures published in 1945, 66,000 people were killed as a direct result of the Hiroshima blast, and 69,000 were injured. By . the end of 1945, the death toll had risen to some 140,000 out of an . estimated population of 350,000. Thousands more died of illness and . injuries later. Three . days after the Hiroshima attack, on August 9, 1945, the United States . dropped a second nuclear bomb on the city of Nagasaki in southern Japan. Japan surrendered six days later, ending the military aggression that . brought it into World War Two. 'Its accuracy was horrendous,' he added. 'It was one heck of a whopper. 'We have nothing that comes close to it . in the stockpile anymore, and neither does Russia. It's the end of an . era.' The B53 was designed to destroy facilities deep underground, and it was carried by B-52 bombers. Since it was made using older technology by engineers who have since retired or died, developing a disassembly process took time. Engineers had to develop complex tools and new procedures to ensure safety. 'We knew going in that this was going to be a challenging project, and we put together an outstanding team with all of our partners to develop a way to achieve this objective safely and efficiently,' said John Woolery, the plant's general manager. Despite being hugely destructive, the 9,000 kiloton B53 was by no means the most deadly nuclear weapon America has built. Between 1945 and 1990, more than 70,000 total warheads were developed, in over 65 different varieties, ranging in yield from around .01 kilotons to the 25 megaton B41 bomb. Since the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991 the U.S. has been steadily reducing its stockpile. In April last year, President Barack Obama signed a historic treaty with Russian leader Dmitry Medvedev to reduce the number of nuclear weapons deployed by the former Cold War enemies. The landmark agreement in the Czech capital Prague committed the superpowers to reducing the number of strategic warheads to 1,550 each - 30 per cent lower than the previous cap. It also limited the number of deployed launchers - ballistic missiles and heavy bombers - to 700 each. Many of the B53s were disassembled in the 1980s, but a significant number remained in the U.S. arsenal until they were retired from the stockpile in 1997. Pantex spokesman Greg Cunningham said he couldn't comment on how many of the bombs have been disassembled at the Texas plant. The weapon is considered dismantled when the roughly 300lbs of high explosives inside are separated from the special nuclear material, known as the pit. The uranium pits from bombs dismantled at Pantex will be stored on an interim basis at the plant, Cunningham said. The material and components are then processed, which includes sanitising, recycling and disposal, the National Nuclear Security Administration said last autumn when it announced the Texas plant's role in the B53 dismantling. The plant will play a large role in similar projects as older weapons are retired from the U.S.'s nuclear arsenal.","Built during the Cuban missile crisis in 1962 .

"Roy Hodgson can afford himself a smug smile of satisfaction knowing that right now he can confidently claim that four of the Premier League's best five goalkeepers on current form are English. It must be years since any England manager could have looked at the top flight and been able to make that boast. Unfortunately the best isn't available to Hodgson, but remarkably he isn't a regular for his own national team. Here's my top five in reverse order: . England goalkeepers (from left to right) Fraser Forster, Ben Foster and Joe Hart train at St George's Park . 5 Robert Green (QPR) – He has made some outstanding stops for Rangers this season and has reduced the errors that used to raise so many doubts about his ability at the very top level. He's unfortunate to be returning to such good form at a time when England already have three goalkeepers unlikely to lose their place in the squad any time soon, injuries permitting. QPR are bottom of the league but that's not because of Green, who's been excellent. Robert Green jumps to gather the ball under pressure during QPR's defeat at Newcastle United on Saturday . 4 Ben Foster (West Brom) – Far from the perfect keeper, indeed he sometimes makes me look technically gifted when the ball is at his feet. But for breathtaking shot-stopping there are few better. His tip over from Ayoze Perez against Newcastle at The Hawthorns earlier this month was the best save of the season so far in my opinion. West Brom goalkeeper Foster dives to make a save during his side's 2-0 defeat by Chelsea . 3 Fraser Forster (Southampton) – He's the clean-sheet king but that isn't always because the goalkeeper is brilliant. However, in this case, closer inspection of the action shows Forster has made a huge contribution to Southampton's success this season. A big, commanding presence was something Saints needed and his confidence is infectious – as is the case with most keepers. An eyebrow-raising price tag hasn't affected him and although he is capable of calamity – he was at fault for Aston Villa's goal on Monday night - there are definitely strengths in his game that contribute more to his growing reputation. Forster made a mistake against Aston Villa but he has been key for Southampton this season . 2 Joe Hart (Manchester City) – It's only when you watch Hart live at a match that you fully appreciate what he brings. He's a leader, he has presence in the box, and he is confident and assertive in his decision-making. When people barked and ranted about his 'mistake' against Stoke earlier this season at the Etihad, it was because he is normally so good in one-on-one situations. I watched him on Saturday and with a less-than-rock-solid defence in front of him Hart made himself big and hard to beat several times in the second half with Swansea looking for an equaliser. His form for England has been excellent this season as well. Is he fault-free? No, but then not many are and that's what he is aiming for I'm sure. His confidence is sometimes interpreted as cockiness which is why some don't like him. I prefer to judge him on his goalkeeping. Is he the best in the Premier League? No, but he's not far off. Manchester City goalkeeper Hart dives to punch the ball clear against Swansea on Saturday . 1 David de Gea (Manchester United) – He's gone from blunder-full to wonderful in his time at Old Trafford. He is now virtually a one-man defence for Manchester United – and boy have they needed him this season. His masterclass against Everton earlier this season was stunning, and his save from Jack Wilshere at Arsenal on Saturday was one of the best we've seen in this campaign. Surely it's only a matter of time before he takes over from Iker Casillas for Spain. And maybe even for Real Madrid. Of course there will be fans reading this and crying that their keeper isn't acknowledged (obviously not Liverpool fans). Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea (right) pulls off a fine save in his side's 2-1 win against Arsenal . De Gea, pictured at the Emirates, has been in outstanding form for Louis van Gaal's side this season . Julian Speroni of Crystal Palace is particularly unfortunate not to make the top five. Brad Guzan is capable of the spectacular for Villa – witness his display in the goalless draw at West Ham. Chelsea's Thibaut Courtois is an excellent keeper but he has so little to do at the moment it's hard to judge him. Lukas Fabianski at Swansea and Burnley's Tom Heaton have also surprised me with their level of performance this season as well. There are some good keepers around the Premier League that's for sure and quite a few of them are English.","Four of the Premier League's top five goalkeepers are English .

"Trying to 'catalyze change': Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan (pictured at their wedding) are donating $120 million over the next five years to the San Francisco Bay Area's public school system . Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan are donating $120million to the San Francisco Bay Area's public school system. The couple's gift will be spread over the next five years and is the biggest allocation to date of the $1.1billion of Facebook stock the couple pledged last year to the nonprofit Silicon Valley Community Foundation. 'Education is incredibly expensive and this is a drop in the bucket,' Chan said at Facebook's Menlo Park, California headquarters. 'What we are trying to do is catalyze change by exploring and promoting the development of new interventions and new models.' The first $5million will go to school districts in San Francisco, Ravenswood and Redwood City and will focus on principal training, classroom technology and helping students transition from the 8th to the 9th grade. The couple and their foundation, called Startup: Education, determined the issues of most urgent need based on discussions with school administrators and local leaders. Zuckerberg and Chan, a pediatrician, discussed the donation in an exclusive interview with the Associated Press. It was Chan's first significant step into the public spotlight and the couple's premier interview together. The two met while studying at Harvard and married in their Palo Alto backyard on May 19, 2012 — the day after Facebook's stock began publicly trading in a rocky initial public offering that now seems a distant memory. In 2010, they joined Giving Pledge, an effort led by Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett to get the country's richest people to donate most of their wealth. 'I'm really focused on connecting the world. That's my main thing, and you're primarily focused on children,' said Zuckerberg, turning to Chan. 'And we're able to do some of this work together, which is neat...There are interesting overlaps.' Chan, 29, and Zuckerberg, 30, have made philanthropy a central theme of their life together. The two made the largest charitable gift on record for 2013. That $1.1billion donation was on top of another $500million the couple gave a year earlier to the Silicon Valley foundation, which helps donors allocate their gifts. 'I just think that philanthropy is a fancy way to say that you care about others and that you want to serve others. Philanthropists: The couple have donated more than $1billion to the Silicon Valley foundation, which helps donors allocate their gifts . 'And that's been a part of me for as long as I can remember,' said Chan, fresh from a pediatrics residency shift at the University of California, San Francisco medical center, where she works primarily with underserved, immigrant families. '(We) have this amazing opportunity it's really important to me that we use this opportunity to continue to give back and create even more change to affect other people's lives.' Last year, Zuckerberg was No 21 on the Forbes list of the world's richest people, right behind Amazon's Jeff Bezos and ahead of well-known billionaires such as activist investor Carl Icahn and philanthropist George Soros. He owns Facebook stock worth over $27billion. Mark Zuckerberg's latest donation comes while questions are still being asked about the success of his $100 million New Jersey's public school system in Newark four years ago. Critics say the donation and the chain of events it set in motion has done little to fix the city's ailing school system. Observers argue that the process lacked meaningful community input and that much of the money has been spent on high-paid contractors and consultants. Vivian Cox Fraser, president of the Urban League of Essex County, once said: 'Everybody's getting paid, but Raheem still can't read.' Zuckerberg has been quick to point out that the results in New Jersey are too early to measure. He said: 'The schools and programs that the folks put in place, only now are they ramping up and students are starting to go through them. 'So you won't know what the outcomes are until like five, seven, 10 years from now.' In 2013, as the median yearly pay for U.S. CEOs crossed the $10million mark amid a widening income gap, Zuckerberg took a symbolic annual salary of $1. Though it's been long in the works, the latest gift comes at a time when critics are still questioning what became of Zuckerberg's $100 million donation to Newark, New Jersey's public school system. Four years ago, he announced the donation flanked by then-mayor Cory Booker and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. A recent New Yorker article criticises the donation and the chain of events it set in motion. While well-intentioned, the money has so far failed to fix the city's ailing school system. The process lacked meaningful community input and much of the money has been spent on high-paid contractors and consultants. Four years later, the money is nearly gone and a lot of people are angry. The story's most poignant quote is from Vivian Cox Fraser, president of the Urban League of Essex County, who says 'Everybody's getting paid, but Raheem still can't read.' Zuckerberg said the Newark experience is 'a big influence on our thinking' with the Bay Area donation. Taking the long view, he's quick to point out that the results in New Jersey are too early to measure. 'The schools and programs that the folks put in place, only now are they ramping up and students are starting to go through them. So you won't know what the outcomes are until like 5, 7, 10 years from now,' he said. 'That said, I think there are some things that are going generally better than we'd expected and some things that we've definitely taken as lessons.' Controversy: The donation comes at a time when critics are still questioning what became of Zuckerberg's $100m donation to New Jersey's schools, revealed four years ago by New Jersey Governor Chris Christie (left) and then-mayor Cory Booker (second right), seen here with Oprah Winfrey at the time of the announcement . One of the positive outcomes Zuckerberg points to: Newark's teacher contracts, which, among other things, provide for performance-based pay bonuses for the district's best teachers. He says the contracts are 'better than anything that had been negotiated before... to reward teachers who were the top performing teachers and hold teachers accountable who were not performing well.' Zuckerberg admits that he and local leaders could have done a better job engaging the community and soliciting ideas about how to spend the money. 'I think one of the things that we took away from this is that we wanted to do our next set of work in a place where we can engage more directly with the community and a place that we care about a lot. The Bay Area just fit that well,' Zuckerberg said. The couple's broader philanthropic goals center on children, education and health, though Zuckerberg is also active in immigration reform. Last year, he and other tech leaders formed Fwd.us, a political group aimed at changing immigration policy, boosting education and encouraging investment in scientific research. Through Facebook, he's also spearheading Internet.org, which aims to connect the more than 70 per cent of the world's 7 billion people who are not yet online. Connecting the world and children: That's the stuff of dinner conversations in the Zuckerberg-Chan household. Generous: Zuckerberg and Chan have made philanthropy a central theme of their life together . 1. Bill & Melinda Gates (Microsoft) - $28billion . 2. Warren Buffett (investor) - $25billion . 3. George Soros (investor) - $10billion . 4. Chuck Feeney (businessman) - $6.3billion . 5. Walton Family (Wal-mart) - $4.6billion . 6. Eli Broad (entrepreneur) - $3.5billion . 7. Michael Bloomberg (businessman) - $2.4bn . 8. Gordon Moore (businessman) - $2.3billion . 9. Paul Allen (businessman) - $2billion . 10. Mark Zuckerberg & Priscilla Chan - $1.6bnSource: Forbes (figures as of Dec 2013) A child of Chinese immigrants who arrived in the U.S. on a refugee boat, Chan recalled an early memory that shaped who she is. It was the time her mother left to give birth to her younger sister and she was left with her grandparents. 'I remember thinking when my mom was absent that it's my turn to step up and care for my grandmother and my grandfather, and I've carried that with me ever since,' Chan recalled. She was two and a half at the time. Zuckerberg, who turned 30 earlier this month, said he and Chan are inspired by Bill and Melissa Gates and others who believe philanthropy 'isn't just something where you can wake up one day and decide to give away a bunch of money and do it effectively. Like anything else, you need practice.' To help prepare for their charitable work in education, Zuckerberg and Chan decided they needed hands-on experience. Chan has taught 4th and 5th grade science at a local private school and Zuckerberg has run an after-school program on entrepreneurship. 'We talked about the education work that we wanted to do and she made this point to me that I wasn't going be one of those people who (try to help by giving) money to places but had never taught anything myself,' Zuckerberg said. He didn't think he'd have time to teach while running Facebook, but Chan set it all up. He says 'it actually ended up being awesome.' He still meets with the students regularly. All the talk of children leads to talk of kids of their own. 'Well one day, but right now.' Chan said. 'That's a yes,' Zuckerberg cut in, laughter all around. 'Yes, but, we are a little preoccupied with other people's children right now,' added Chan.

"Arsenal vs Manchester United should be postponed due to injuries . Jack Wilshere's critics need to pipe down... he can become world class . I had a conversation with former Scotland striker Andy Gray after an England defeat about 10 years ago which went something like this: . AG – that was awful . AD – it was, but as a Scotsman you can hardly talk . AG – At least we know we’re no good! It was right at the time but now the tables are totally turned. VIDEO Scroll down for Scotland vs England: Sportsmail's international friendly preview . Andy Gray (fourth from right) with England and Scotland legends ahead of a clash between the two in 1999 . England fans have no doubt whatsoever where the national team is at. They generally do well in qualifiers, but fail badly at tournaments. No England fan I know thought we would do anything at the World Cup in Brazil and so it proved. I doubt that pessimism will be different come the European Championships in France. What about Scotland? Full of bravado when they play England, some Scots even pretended last year’s defeat at Wembley was some sort of moral victory. They even claimed the same about the defeat in Germany recently. In fact a few decent performances and a couple of results – a draw in Poland and a win over Ireland – have somehow become the stuff of legend with Gordon Strachan the new kilted Braveheart Messiah. Credit where it is due, the winner on Friday night was a fantastic goal, and there is definitely improvement which the Scottish fans have every right to enjoy. Scotland players go wild after Shaun Maloney (centre) scores their winner against Republic of Ireland . Scotland's Tartan Army were in full voice at Celtic Park on Friday night . But Andy Gray’s accusation that the English were deluded all those years ago now applies to Scotland. If they beat England’s B team and then thrash Gibraltar, the delusion will reach epic proportions. But here’s the reality of their qualifying group: Poland beat Germany, and they lead the group; Germany should win the group, Ireland have four of their next five qualifiers at home – the only away trip in that time is to Gibraltar; the Scots have trips to Georgia and Ireland, then home games with Poland and Germany. Sure they could win them all, but any Scots thinking qualification for the Euros is going to be easy is totally deluded. And there’s delusion about the Scottish identity. On Friday night Ireland’s Aiden McGeady was booed because he chose the Irish despite being born in Falkirk. Yet it’s not a problem – and it shouldn’t be – for the Scots to field the likes of Russell Martin, Steven Fletcher and Chris Martin, all born in England. Is that blatant hypocrisy? If it isn’t then do Scotland have an identity crisis? Glasgow-born Everton winger Aiden McGeady was roundly booed by Scotland fans during the game . I’m looking forward to Scotland against England but sadly it stopped being about football long ago. It has now become a game where Scotland raise their game despite it only being a friendly. And worse than that it has become a fixture about drink, hate, war and trouble. The last time I was in Glasgow for a Scotland v England game a Scottish fan jumped on a table in a pub and brandished a massive sword, waving it around above his head. Unsurprisingly, the pub cleared quicker than Hampden Park did after Paul Scholes double dumped on the Scots. What has that got to do with football? Scotland manager Gordon Strachan has overseen an upturn in fortunes since taking the job . There were so many drunks (from both countries) slumped around Hampden and the city centre after the game I wondered how much football they’d witnessed through their blurred double vision. If England and Scotland are drawn together in qualification, or at a tournament, then let’s get the game on. But failing that, I’m not bothered. And I know I’m not the only one who isn’t particularly excited about this fixture.","Scotland beat Republic of Ireland 1-0 on Friday night .

"Arsene Wenger has become like Ian Beale - he's got nothing left. And when the long-serving EastEnder lost the lot - business, home and self respect - he went a bit crazy. Frenchman Wenger might as well jump on a tube to Walford East and go looking for Phil Mitchell's shoulder to cry on.  In fact, Walford Town is probably more the Frenchman's level tactically. Arsenal games are great entertainment for the neutral and my work is taking me to four in the next month - I can't wait to see a load of their players ambling back from the opposition half while three or four opponents surge towards Wojciech Szczesny's goal.

Mikel Arteta looks desperate to go back to his attacking ways, which is understandable. That's why Arsenal signed him. There was talk of how the Manchester United game would have been over by half-time had Arsenal been more clinical. These people must have missed the Anderlecht performance. Tactically Arsenal are a joke. A very funny one, too. To make it worse, Wenger revealed recently that he tried – and failed – to sign both Paul Pogba and Lionel Messi. Quite how that conversation with Messi went is open to speculation. Wenger: 'Lionel, do you want to come to Arsenal?' Messi: 'No thanks.' Beale (right), played by Adam Woodyatt, enjoys happier times with Pat Butcher at the Queen Victoria pub . United striker Wayne Rooney (right) puts his side 2-0 up against the Gunners on Saturday evening . Wenger has revealed how he tried to sign Lionel Messi when the Barcelona superstar was a teenager . Olivier Giroud and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain appear dejected after the final whistle at the Emirates . But imagine the team that Wenger 'nearly' bought. It includes Luis Suarez, Pogba, Messi and Cesc Fabregas. He's not helping himself by talking about players he possibly could have signed but didn't. Credit to Wenger though, for signing Alexis Sanchez. He has been a joy to watch this season. But when you step back for a second, you should be asking whether that was an area of the team where they needed to spend £30million. This is why I question that signing. If you're asking whether Wenger signed a quality player in Alexis Sanchez, then the answer is obviously yes. If you put the question into context, then it becomes a debate. Was signing a player like Sanchez Wenger's priority in the summer? No, of course not. It was clear even last season that Arsenal needed a centre-half and a defensive midfielder to make them genuine contenders for the Premier League and the Champions League. Wenger's and his men face a tough Champions League clash against Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday . Alexis Sanchez (left), pictured moving away from Marouane Fellaini, had a quiet game against United . Take Sanchez away from the side and Arsenal would be even worse of course. But take him away and replace him with a centre-half and a defensive midfielder bought with that money, and they might be doing a lot better than they are now. The proof is in the results and performances so far this season. Wenger should have signed the players the team needed, and if he got Sanchez on top of that then Arsenal could have been brilliant this season. So many high quality defensive midfielders have been bought and sold since Arsenal last had a decent one – that was Gilberto Silva who left in 2008. And worryingly for Gunners fans, Wenger spoke last week about giving Abou Diaby a new contract. Don't misunderstand me, I have every sympathy for injured players. But Diaby is not the answer to Arsenal's problems. Wenger has admitted that he could offer Abou Diaby a new contract despite the midfielder's injury problems . Bayer Leverkusen midfielder Lars Bender (second from left) could've been an option for the Gunners . Have a look at every other Premier League club. Could it be argued that they all have better options in defensive midfield positions than Arsenal? Neither Arteta nor Flamini do the job properly, so would, for example, Sandro or Karl Henry at bottom-of-the-table QPR be better? I'm not saying Wenger should sign those two, but it's not ridiculous to suggest they are both better at holding in midfield than the Arsenal pair. Some might say the players Arsenal need are hard to find. But a man of Wenger's experience should know that the likes of Lars Bender and Mats Hummels are the missing pieces. Can Wenger persuade them to come to the Emirates? He's not worth his £8million-a-year salary if he can't.","Arsenal were embarrassed by Manchester United at the Emirates .

"Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini spoke of his relief after his side made heavy weather of Sheffield Wednesday in the FA Cup third round. James Milner struck twice, including a stoppage-time winner, as the Barclays Premier League champions came from behind to beat their battling Sky Bet Championship opponents 2-1 at the Etihad Stadium. City toiled after falling behind to an Atdhe Nuhiu strike in the 14th minute and only roused themselves in the latter stages with Milner switching to a forward role and equalising after 65 minutes. Stuart Gray (right) gives out his instructions while Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini (left) looks on . Sheffield Wednesday took a surprise 1-0 lead against Manchester City on Sunday at the Etihad in the FA Cup . Pellegrini said: 'Yes I am relieved because we didn't play well. 'We play very badly except the last 20 minutes, when we hit another gear to try to create the space against a team that defended very well. 'When you play against this kind of team it is difficult when you are 1-0 down.' Milner's double was the perfect way for the England international to celebrate his 29th birthday, but his future at the club is still to be resolved. Milner's contract expires at the end of the season and, although talks over a new deal have reached an advanced stage, nothing has yet been signed and he has been linked with Liverpool. Pellegrini said: '(There is) no news. I hope we will find an arrangement. Nuhiu shoots at the Manchester City goal after 14 minutes at the Etihad Stadium to put Wednesday 1-0 up . Milner gets his shot away while under pressure to get Manchester City back into the  tie after going 1-0 down . 'But I think that I have said already what I think about James Milner. He is very useful. He always plays with 100 per cent commitment and intensity. 'I am very happy for him and also as it his birthday.' Milner grabbed the headlines but the real catalyst for City's fightback was the double introduction of playmakers David Silva and Samir Nasri just after the hour. Pellegrini had rested the pair among six changes but they made an immediate impact after coming on. They both had a hand in the equaliser and Silva had a chance to win the game himself late on before setting up Milner's second. Pellegrini said: 'We have a lot of players and (have had) a lot of games in the last 10 days. We have played four. 'We didn't do well but we when we returned to our normal offensive formation with (Jesus) Navas, Silva, Nasri and Milner on top we scored two goals.' Milner equalised in the FA Cup tie before scoring the winner against Sheffield Wednesday . Pellegrini admitted he was relieved to see his side comeback to win the tie and avoid embarrassment . Wednesday's performance was much improved from their last visit to Eastlands, when they were thrashed 7-0 in the Capital One Cup in September. Manager Stuart Gray was pleased with the Owls' performance and felt just one late lapse cost them. Gray said: 'Last time we were here we got beat 7-0. It was 0-0 at half-time and they went up a gear and put seven past us. 'It was nice to go in at 1-0, I think we thoroughly deserved it. We had a gameplan to hit them on the break, we frustrated them. 'The goal that we got - Stevie May pulled away on the break and pulled it back to Atdhe Nuhiu and it was a great finish. 'In the end they have shown us total respect as they put on Silva and Nasri and (Gael) Clichy. It was just tired minds that caught us out. 'They kept the ball better than us in the last 15 minutes and when you have tired minds, you can make mistakes unfortunately. The winning goal was a mistake by us but I am so proud of my players. They have pushed the champions to the last minute. 'I thought it was going to go to a replay. It just shows in this game that you have to play until the final whistle.'","Manchester City beat Sheffield Wednesday 2-1 in their FA Cup clash .

"West Ham have announced record pre-tax profits of £10.3million following a successful year both on and off the pitch. The east London outfit have put their success down to finishing 13th in the Premier League, progressing to the semi-final of the Capital One Cup and the agreed sale of the Boleyn Ground as some of the main factors. West Ham's profit is particularly significant as the Premier League club announced a before tax loss of £3.5m last year. West Ham have announced pre-tax profits of £10.3million following a hugely successful year .

Joint chairman David Sullivan announced in his end of year financial statement that he is 'satisfied' with his side's performance over the course of 2014. Sullivan wrote: 'My board and I are satisfied with the achievements we have in the 2013-2014 season. 'At the start of the season we bought Andy Carroll and Stewart Downing, and took a number of players on loan during the January window, investing a total of £32.9m. 'Later in the year, my co-chairman David Gold invested a further £3.5m to allow the manager to go into the transfer market to cover our injury crisis. 'We have further invested in the playing staff for the 2014-15 season with the significant investment into the purchases of Mauro Zarate, Diego Poyet, Enner Valencia, Aaron Cresswell, Cheikou Kouyate, Diafra Sakho and Morgan Amalfitano.

'This season will bring its own challenges, but we continue to believe we will deliver both on and off the pitch by investing in the team, the brand and managing the business well.' Vice chairman Karren Brady, who is the driving force behind the club's move to the Olympic Stadium, echoed Sullivan's sentiments: 'Through the hard work of a fantastic, dedicated, loyal and determined team both on and off the pitch the club has grown in size, revenue and in stature this season. 'The management team off the pitch were able to capitalise and maximise on all the opportunities the manager and the team delivered on the pitch.'

"I hope the Jack Wilshere critics will pipe down now. It was a moment that flashed by, it happened in the blink of an eye. But it proved that Wilshere has world-class ability, and if he adds consistency to his game for club and country – in terms of performance and fitness – then he may be considered world class sooner rather than later. England had just conceded an own goal on Saturday and were trailing 1-0 to a side sitting just behind them in the group. Slovenia were setting out to stop England getting back into the game so a bit of magic was needed from someone wearing the Three Lions. Jack Wilshere put in a man-of-the-match performance in England's 3-1 win over Slovenia at Wembley . Wilshere poses for a photo on the pitch with England fitness coach Tony Strudwick at Celtic Park . Straight after the restart, Wilshere demanded and received the ball from Phil Jagielka in the Wembley centre circle. He turned and with an opponent on top of him, had the option of passing backwards to Gary Cahill, or sideways to Nathaniel Clyne. Neither were bad options, both would have meant England kept possession, which of course is vital. Wilshere chose to do neither. Instead he turned and smartly flicked the ball away from the opponent with his left foot and scooted away, leading the charge and leaving his man standing. That was a touch of world-class ability. Had he lost the ball England could easily have found themselves two down. Wilshere is often a target for criticism but he has the ability to be a world-class player for England and Arsenal . But with incredible speed of thought and feet, Wilshere controlled the ball, gauged how quickly his opponent was charging in and executed a move to open the pitch up. It meant Slovenian players had to close him down leaving spaces for Wilshere to exploit. So the next task, having created space for himself, was to spot a pass. And he found Wayne Rooney with a perfect ball. The captain ran at Slovenia, won a penalty and England were level seconds after going behind. That Wilshere-Rooney link-up is something I’ve written about before in this column. It’s a special understanding few players have. Wayne Rooney converts England's penalty to equalise after Wilshere's hard work in midfield . From the moment Wilshere receives the ball to the penalty being awarded takes less than nine seconds. That’s the kind of special football England need to produce in games. The more Wilshere feels comfortable doing that sort of thing in the middle of the park in an England shirt, the more likely it is to happen in a tournament against a big team. I’m not saying Wilshere is world class. I am saying he has the ability to become world class. In terms of international football, the real test will come at the European Championship of course. But I’m delighted to see Wilshere, a player of such immense promise, starting to consistently fulfill that. Wilshere hasn't always had it his own way at Arsenal with stalled progress over the last couple years . Apparently Chris Waddle, a player of immense talent who I greatly admired, said Wilshere didn’t deserve man of the match, even adding that no England player was worth it. That must be disappointing for the Arsenal midfielder after he grabbed hold of the game when England went behind. It takes special character to demand the ball when the pressure is on and the team isn’t playing well. It takes special talent to then do what Wilshere did for the equaliser. I’m comfortable criticising England when it’s due. But when a player delivers, let’s give him the credit he deserves. Carry on Jack.","Jack Wilshere had a magic moment in England's win over Slovenia .

But Lord counters that he has still been invited to clubs despite no longer being on the IAB and only met problems at Blackburn Rovers. He has also been to games at Manchester City, Aston Villa, Sheffield Wednesday, Bury and Accrington Stanley. Alex Horne (left) has written a letter to Edward Lord over his conduct after leaving FA post . Horne said in a letter to Lord: ‘Even as a serving IAB member, I would find this strange when there is no rationale for such activity. ‘As an ex-member of the IAB, I find this behaviour truly abhorrent and I would ask you to cease and desist with immediate effect.’ Lord wrote back: ‘When I was a member of IAB it was agreed that I would continue to visit clubs at my own expense to liaise with senior figures on inclusion matters. ‘No club withdrew their invitation after my office told them of my change of circumstances.

"John Terry hopes Chelsea will respond to seeing their eight-point lead over defending Premier League champions Manchester City evaporate. Chelsea lost 5-3 at Tottenham on New Year's Day and now sit level with City at the top of the table after Frank Lampard, a team-mate of Terry's for 13 seasons at Stamford Bridge, scored to earn last season's league winners victory over Sunderland earlier in the day. It was Chelsea's second loss of the season, but stuttering away form has allowed City to wipe out the deficit. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Chelsea captain John Terry looks on after Chelsea concede their fourth against Tottenham on Thursday . Terry admitted he has found it difficult to see their eight-point advantage over Manchester City wiped out . Harry Kane (left) of Tottenham shoots past Terry (centre) and into the net as Chelsea lost 5-3 . 'It's hard to see them claw us back,' Terry said on chelseafc.com. 'We were eight points in front and now we're level on points. 'It's disappointing to have lost that lead but we said in the dressing room we'll come together, put a run together and hopefully get a lead again.' Jose Mourinho, who railed over a 'clear campaign' against Chelsea following the draw at Southampton, was outraged by further perceived injustices against his side. Like his manager, Terry believed the Blues should have had a penalty when 1-0 up after Jan Vertonghen fell on the ball and brushed it with his hand. 'We should have had a penalty at Southampton and we should have had another one at 1-0,' said the captain, who scored Chelsea's third. 'The game's finished then. Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't, and in the last few games we haven't. 'We're very disappointed to start the new year with a defeat but we'll move on from this. Jose Mourinho (centre) was frustrated with the display of referee Phil Dowd at White Hart Lane . Mourinho questioned Dowd's (fourth left) ability to keep up with play during the game against Tottenham . Terry felt Chelsea should have had a penalty when Jan Vertonghen (left) appeared to handle in the area . 'I thought at times we played some really good football, it just wasn't our day so we'll forget this one and move on very quickly. 'Once we got the goal they were on the back foot but they scored from nothing and were back in the game.' The defeat could have many ramifications, not least for the title race and Mourinho, who invited scrutiny on the performance of referee Phil Dowd at White Hart Lane and could face Football Association disciplinary action. Mourinho felt Federico Fazio had brought down Eden Hazard when the last man and should have been sent off. Despite accepting Hazard's version of events and that no foul had been made, Mourinho used the incident to highlight Dowd's display. Mourinho told BT Sport: 'Hazard, honest as always, tells me in his opinion it was not a foul or a red card, so that's good, in spite of Mr Dowd is too slow to go with that ball, he was like 40 yards away, he made the right decision. Eden Hazard (centre) told boss Mourinho that he did not believe Federico Fazio's (left) challenge was a foul . Gary Cahill (left) could face disciplinary action after kicking Kane (right) in the back late on in the game . 'The decision (that) was like 10 metres away, he couldn't make and that's a decision that is the crucial moment of the game.' That was a reference to the Vertonghen incident, which came when Chelsea led and Mourinho was unwilling to forget, even though many thought it incidental in a game where Chelsea conceded five goals. Disciplinary action may await for the Portuguese and Chelsea defender Gary Cahill, who may be punished for kicking Harry Kane in the back late in the game while the striker was on the ground.","Chelsea were beaten 5-3 by Tottenham at White Hart Lane on Thursday .

Chelsea's Diego Costa (right) raises his hand to Tottenham's Jan Vertonghen following a tackle . But the Brazilian-born Spaniard manager to make himself a nuisance nonetheless with Jan Vertonghen looking ready to floor him after one late challenge on 43 minutes – though perhaps wisely, he backed down fairly swiftly.

Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho looks on with fury as he makes a point to the referee's assistant . But Fazio looked as if he played the ball and Hazard didn’t protest. Mourinho was quieter when Gary Cahill booted a grounded Harry Kane on 75 minutes right in front of both benches. OSCAR GIVEN THE KANE AT THE BREAK . It was the fourth match of the Christmas season so it was hardly surprising to see errors multiplying. Oscar (right) was shrugged off with ease by Harry Kane who would then fire home Tottenham's equaliser . That said, the lacklustre way in which Oscar and Cesc Fabregas attempted to defend against Harry Kane as he made his run for the first-half equaliser was unforgivable.

Given that the latter only left 18 months ago, it seems an indecently-short time in which to elevate him to the Tottenham pantheon, given the vitriol the likes of Teddy Sheringham and Sol Campbell received for leaving the club.

THE BELGIANS ARE TAKING OVER THE PREMIER LEAGUE . The Belgian takeover of the Premier League continues apace. When Mousa Dembele came on, he joined Jan Vertonghen, Nacer Chadli, Thibaut Courtois and Eden Hazard as the fifth player from that nation on the pitch.

Yes indeed, ITV had made their way from Florida to bring us the opening salvos of Brazil 2014. And right away, they set quite the challenge for their BBC counterparts. The opening title sequence was an absolute beauty (‘our director’s been working on it most of his life’, said Adrian), with its cool samba version of the evergreen standard ‘Brazil’ and famous World Cup scenes recreated by Brazilians on the street and on the beach. Alright on the night: Adrian Chiles made a fine job of his opening credits in Brazil . Special guest: World Cup winning Italian Fabio Cannavaro joined ITV as a studio pundit . All-star cast: Lee Dixon, Cannavaro and Patrick Vieira offered expert opinion on the World Cup opener for ITV . On the beach: Ian Wright was given an even more luxurious location to report from . Speaking . of sun-kissed sands, it certainly looks like Ian Wright has found his . spiritual home on the Copacabana. He was having just way too much fun on . there with his mate, the cameraman ‘Nozza’, as Wrighty called him. It . was the old Arsenal front man’s job to set the scene, which he managed . to do whilst also name dropping ‘my dear friend Barry Manilow’ and . accosting a surprised young German surfer called Stefan. Who thirty . seconds later was Wrighty’s new dear friend ‘Stef’. This . sense of joie de vivre also made it into the opening ceremony In Sao . Paolo - finally. Once the giant salad buffet made way for the dancers and . the drummers, there was at last a sense of occasion rising up from the . stadium. Tragically . though, that atmosphere didn’t make its way to our tellies when the big . finale came. That was a five minute horror show. Local . star Claudia and top drawer import J-Lo teamed up for the World Cup . song ‘We Are One’. But the sound was virtually non existent for the . audience at home. And the close ups were ruined by what sound there was . being out of sync with the pictures. As . the stars left the field, a barely whelmed Clive Tyldesley informed us . ‘there’ll be a closing ceremony in 31 days from now’. Which at that . precise moment, seemed much too close for comfort! You had to be there: The atmosphere at the opening ceremony didn't transmit well . xxxx . Star of the show: Jeniffer Lopez was hired to add some extra glamour to the opening ceremony . Off key: J-Lo's performance was hampered by poor sound quality and syncing problems . Best of friends: Matt Smith and Carlos Alberto got on very well as they reported from the stadium . Back . in the ITV studio, and Adrian was equally as crestfallen as Tyldesley . had seemed. But that was because Matt Smith had the plum job of . interviewing Carlos Alberto in the stadium. And got a big hug from the . former Brazil captain in the process. ‘Wow, . a pat on the back from Carlos Alberto’, said Chiles. Then looking to . his right at the indefatigable Patrick Viera, told him ‘I’ve been . waiting two years for one of them from you’. Patrick smiled broadly, but didn’t twitch. ‘No?’, sighed Adrian. ‘OK’. Mind . you, worse was to come. ITV’s other special opening night guest was . Fabio Cannavaro. And he spoke wistfully of Italia 90 and how he had been . there as a ball boy to see his hero score - ‘Lineker’! No justice is . there, Adrian. Someone . clearly happy to be there is Joey Barton. Eurosport are screening a . series of live preview and review shows on site. Joey was sat on a . veranda above the Copacabana. There . was a cooling breeze gently ruffing his quiff. And the presenter . opposite him, Ashley House, was in a suit and Brazil T shirt. Be honest, . Joey, Bit more like it than Question Time, eh? But . life isn’t all a beach. There was the small matter of a tournament to . get under way. Which happened straight after a symbolic gesture of peace . in Sao Paolo. ‘Nothing like a FIFA congress for bright ideas’ tut . tutted Tyldesley. Then, as we saw the three birds of peace rise into the air he muttered just under his breath ‘the doves from above’. Vic . and Bob will have approved, Clive. Indeed, they may have been . scrabbling around in their front rooms for a notepad when, in the second . half, he was chatting about the new World Cup ball. “The one they used in the last tournament was roundly criticised’, he told us. Keep that one in the act, Clive. Colourful: Locals showed up in their numbers to cheer Brazil on to victory against Croatia . Excitement: There was plenty of carnival atmosphere among the home crowd . Not . everything was a laughing matter, though, we were to discover. Because . at the end of the game and on the return to the studio, a shot of the . beach that we had last seen empty as everyone left to to watch the game, . was now busy with a protest. ‘FIFA . GO HOME’ read one of the banners as Chiles explained people had been . gathering for about ten minutes when they ‘heard sharp, clattering . sounds’. At which point the studio camera picked out cracks in the . window from stones thrown from the below. Thankfully . no one in the studio was hurt. Indeed, our plucky host was clearly . determined not to let the incident ruin the mood. Because for no . apparent reason at all, he wrapped coverage of the first game of the . World Cup in Brazil with a clip of elephants playing football in . Thailand. ‘You . will see a hell of a defensive wall there’, he chuckled. You might want . to have a word with Clive about some material, Adrian? Animosity: As the sun went down a more sinister side to the World Cup was highlighted on the beach .

"Kei Nishikori blew men’s tennis off its axis on Saturday night when he caused a sensational upset to overcome Novak Djokovic and reach the US Open final. The 24-year-old, from Japan, braved fierce heat and humidity to beat the world No 1 6-4, 1-6, 7-6, 6-3 in two hours 52 minutes and become the first male from his country to reach a Grand Slam in the modern era. He was left awaiting the winner of the second semi-final between Roger Federer and No 14 seed Marin Cilic, for whom the stakes were substantially raised. VIDEO Scroll down to see Nishikori despatch Federer earlier this year . History maker: Kei Nishikori celebrates beating world No 1 Novak Djokovic in the US Open semi-final . Special Kei: Nishikori's 6-4, 1-6, 7-6 (4), 6-3 win makes him the first Asian Grand Slam finalist . Relief: After his previous two matches lasted a total eight and a half hours, four sets was quick work . Nishikori, who has had 14 retirements in his career and been frequently been held back by injuries or a lack of stamina, handled the brutal conditions better than the Wimbledon champion, who for once was outlasted. It was a brilliant display from the No 10 seed, whose nerve occasionally failed him but who held out to pull off a seismic result against the strong favourite for the title, who defeated Andy Murray in the previous round. ‘It’s an amazing feeling, I’m so happy,’ said an ecstatic Nishikori afterwards. ‘I hope I can recover for the final. He started to play better in the second set. I hope it’s big news in Japan. I feel the support from there. It’s four in the morning there but I hope they’ve been watching.’ Trained at the Nick Bollettieri IMG academy in Florida from the age of 11, Nishikori’s experience of the fierce American summer heat came into its own as he refused to flag against Djokovic, who suffered in the furnace that the Arthur Ashe Stadium became. Pushed: Novak Djokovic stretches for a backhand against Kei Nishikori in their US Open semi-final . Underdog: Nishikori shocked the world No 1 in their meeting in New York . His coach Michael Chang seemed more animated than he ever was as a player as he watched from the bench, urging on his young charge, who lost in the first round of this event last year to British outsider Dan Evans. Nishikori showed his potential earlier this year when he should have beaten Rafael Nadal on clay in Madrid before seizing up with cramp, but this did not happen when in sight of the biggest win of his career. His backhand was especially punishing as he took the first set, only for normal service seemingly to be resumed when Djokovic bounced back in the second by making him run all over the place. The Japanese failed to serve out the third set at 5-4 and it seemed his chance might have been blown, especially as he conceded the break back with a double fault. Frustration: Serbian Djokovic remonstrates with the umpire as he is shocked by the world No 11 . Helpless: Djokovic was formidable in the second set but Nishikori was otherwise in control . Yet in the tie-break, in which both players were extremely nervous and double faulted once each, it was his mental strength that just about held out and he took it 7-4 — crucial, given the expectation that he might fade towards the end of the match. That did not happen and it was Djokovic who became more erratic in the heat of the afternoon, going down an early break in the fourth and never threatening to get it back against an opponent who, while not physically imposing, is a terrific mover around the court. Nishikori got safely to 5-3 in the fourth and then broke once more for good measure when Djokovic drove a final forehand long. Gracious: Djokovic congratulates Nishikori after he is bundled out of the US Open .

"Two weeks after Adolf Hitler committed suicide, German troops and American soldiers fought together to rescue a group of high profile French prisoners in the final days of the war. The true story is one of the lesser known tales from World War II but reads like the plot of a Hollywood movie. It was the only time Allied forces fought alongside German soldiers during the six year war. American and German troops fought together during World War II to defend a Castle Itter, pictured . The unlikely alliance was formed to defend a group of high profile French prisoners from an advancing SS unit . Historian Stephen Harding's book 'The Last Battle' recounts the unlikely alliance that was forged to save a group of mainly French politicians who had been held captive at Castle Itter in Austria since the German invasion of France. The group included former French president Albert Lebrun, former prime ministers Édouard Daladier and Paul Reynaud, military generals Maxime Weygand and Maurice Gamelin and even a famous tennis star called Jean Borotra. Fourteen American soldiers, with just two tanks and limited ammunition, teamed up with about 20 German Wehrmacht troops to defend the castle from an oncoming SS unit. Over two days, the bizarre alliance, led by 27-year-old New Yorker Captain Jack Lee, managed to withstand an SS bombardment until Allied reinforcements arrived. The battle was one of the last of the war. Harding's book is the culmination of 20 years of research on the battle fought in early May, 1945. It began after the guards at Castle Itter in Austria's North Tyrol fled on May 4, as the German army became increasingly leaderless. Former French prime minister Paul Reynaud, left, and tennis player Jean Borotra, far right, were both held prisoner and fought in the Battle for Castle Itter . The castle was run as a subcamp of . Dachau concentration camp but the VIP prisoners were held in relative . luxury and were given access to the library and housed in individual . guest rooms. Once the guards had fled, the inmates armed themselves with weapons including submachine guns and rifles left behind in the castle as they waited for Allied forces to rescue them. On May 5, 1945, troops from the American 103rd Infantry Division liberated the castle. They had teamed up with a German unit, which had been persuaded to help the prisoners by inmate Zoonimir Cuckovic, who had left the castle to try to find the nearest Allied unit. Harding wrote in Historynet.com that the unit, led by 'surrender-minded' German Major Josef Gangel, decided to help as they after 'realising that aiding in their rescue would reflect well on him and his men.' Capt Jack Lee, then ranked as a first lieutenant, had volunteered to lead a patrol to the castle. His men included six members of the all-African American Company D, 17th Armored Infantry Battalion. Anti-fascist French politician Édouard   Daladier, left, and former Italian prime minister Francesco Saverio Nitti, right, were also held captive . Former French president Albert Lebrun (centre) was also held captive at Castle Itter during the war . Within hours of the alliance reaching the castle, it was attacked by Waffen-SS troops. The Nazi troops used antitank guns, which destroyed parts of the castle, and attacked with submachine guns. Harding said that the French VIP prisoners, including Michel Clemenceau, son of World War I prime minister George, also took up arms. He wrote that as the SS bombardment intensified, Capt Lee's solution 'was literally medieval: the defenders and the French notables would withdraw into the castle's massive keep. 'They would use their few remaining rounds of ammunition, their bayonets, and—if necessary—their fists to make the SS men fight for every stairwell, every hallway, every floor.' However, the surviving castle defenders were saved when American 103rd Infantry Division troops finally arrived. Major Gangel, who is regarded as a hero of anti-Nazi resistance in Germany and Austria for his action, died during the battle after being shot by a sniper. Jack Lee won the Distinguished Service Cross for his efforts defending the castle. The . agent of that action was the always-helpful Zoonimir Cuckovic, a.k.a. André, who volunteered to go find the nearest Allied unit and bring it . back to secure the castle. Vaulting aboard a bike liberated from a shopkeeper in the surrounding . village, Cuckovic set off for Wörgl, a large town on the Inn River six . miles northwest of the castle. He was unaware that much of the town was . occupied by elements of a Waffen-SS regiment, and was lucky to stumble . instead upon a group of Wehrmacht troops led by a surrender-minded major . named Gangel. Upon hearing of the French notables at Castle Itter—and . no doubt realizing that aiding in their rescue would reflect well on him . and his men—Gangel dispatched Cuckovic toward Inns-bruck, thirty-eight . miles to the southwest. Innsbruck had just been taken by the U.S. 103rd . Infantry Division, and chances were excellent that Cuckovic would . encounter American troops moving east toward Wörgl. But to be on the . safe side, and possibly to better his own chances with the Americans, . Gangel jumped in his Kübelwagen and, leading a truck packed with some . twenty Wehrmacht troops, sped off toward Kufstein, thirteen miles in the . opposite direction.","The two sides fought off an SS bombardment at Castle Itter in Austria .

"Marine biologists are working to uncover what caused several thousand Humboldt squid to wash ashore along the Santa Cruz County shoreline on Sunday. Thousands of squid carcasses are littering the 12 mile stretch of coastline from Aptos to Watsonville, where the high tide may have had something do to with the sea creatures essentially committing mass suicide. The general public is advised by scientists not to touch or eat the squid, as they may contain dangerous toxins. Thousands of Humboldt squid washed up on Santa Cruz County beaches Sunday in a mass stranding that is a mystery to marine scientists . The general public are advised not to touch or eat the squid as they may contain dangerous toxins . Scientists including Hanna Rosen believe the squid may have consumed toxic algae . Hanna Rosen, a graduate student at Stanford University’s Hopkins Marine Station, told San Francisco’s CBS affiliate that she saw people trying to put the squid back in the sea, only to watch them return to the beach. ‘They don’t see the shore very often,’ Rosen said. ‘So it might just be that they don’t understand what’s going on around them, and they’re just trying to get away and don’t realize that if they swim towards the shore, they’re going to run out of water eventually.’ Scientists from Stanford said the squid were predominantly juveniles as adult Humboldt squid can grow up to six-feet long and 100 pounds. They added that the squid were probably conceived and born in Monterey Bay, but were unable to navigate their way out to open waters. Tests have shown that the stranded squid were well-fed from feasting on smaller market squid and cannibalizing each other, which is normal behavior for the creatures. Sunday’s phenomenon marks the third squid stranding in the past six weeks, from Santa Cruz to Pacific Grove. Marine biologists are currently analyzing the contents of the animals’ stomachs to see if they ingested something that might have disoriented them. One theory under consideration is that the squid were disorientated after consuming toxic algae. ‘It is possible that the squid are . ingesting these zero toxins or getting them through their food which is . causing them to be disorientated and swim unto the beach,’ said Rosen. Thousands of squid carcasses are littering a 12 mile stretch of coastline from Aptos to Watsonville . Sunday's phenomenon marks the third squid stranding in the past six weeks . Scientists have found traces of domoic acid, a toxin produced by algae, in some of the beached squid, but the findings are so far inconclusive. Humboldt squid have not been observed in the Monterey Bay waters for a few years, making recent events all the more suspicious. Some scientists attribute the phenomenon to this year’s El Nino weather patterns, which could have attracted them to the cooler climates of Northern and Central California’s coast. Conservation of the Humboldt squid off . the coast of California is not a major concern because the squid can . reproduce in mass numbers.

"Port Stanley, the capital of the Falkland Islands, should be renamed Port Margaret as a tribute to Baroness Thatcher, senior figures in the Foreign Office and Ministry of Defence are suggesting. The idea is being backed by MPs and is also attracting considerable support on the islands, which Lady Thatcher was responsible for liberating in 1982. The proposal is likely to trigger fury in Argentina, which has been ratcheting up the rhetoric over the sovereignty of the Falklands around the 30th anniversary of the conflict. Our heroine: Margaret Thatcher with troops in the Falklands in 1982. One islander said: 'We owe everything to her' Margaret Thatcher stands proudly on Victory Green, Port Stanley, during her visit to mark the tenth anniversary of the Falklands War . Port Stanley is named after Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby, who was British prime minister three times in the mid-19th century, but never set foot in the Falklands. Tory MP Tobias Ellwood, a Parliamentary aide at the Foreign Office, said: ‘I would warmly encourage the Falklanders to consider this as a fitting way to remember her legacy. ‘She has been an inspirational 20th century political hero. One way to mark this extraordinary life and contribution would be for the Port to be renamed from one prime minister who never set foot there to another who liberated it.’ Mr Ellwood, who headed a successful campaign to have the tower which houses Big Ben renamed the Elizabeth Tower in honour of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee last year, added: ‘Port Margaret has a fine ring to it.’ Lady Thatcher meets personnel aboard the ship HMS Antrim during her five-day visit to the Falkand Islands in 1983 . The 'Iron Lady' and her husband Sir Denis visit the Falkland Islands. Sir Denis is pictured pointing to Twin Sister Mountains, west of Government House . Devizes MP Claire Perry, who is Parliamentary private secretary to Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, said: ‘I think it is a fantastic idea, as long as the people of the Falklands agree.’ Andrew Rosindell, secretary of the all-party Parliamentary group on the Falklands, said the islanders would want to mark Lady Thatcher’s passing. ‘It is up to them exactly how they do it,’ he said. ‘It could be a renaming or it could be a statue in Stanley. Whatever they do I am sure they will commemorate her in an appropriate way.’ # . Zoran Zuvic, a Falkland Islands Defence Force member who met Lady Thatcher four times, said: ‘Anything that remembers Maggie and what she did for us is a good idea, and I imagine many other Falklanders would support it too. 'She’s our hero, a great person, and she will forever be part of the history of our islands. Margaret Thatcher and her husband Denis standing on Victory Green in Port Stanley on the Falkland Islands for the 10th anniversary of liberation . A group of former British paratroopers who fought in the Falklands War, salute as they leave a wreath for former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher at a street sign in her name after hearing of her death, in Port Stanley . ‘We recently renamed an island here after Craig Jones, a Para who was the last soldier to die in the war. If we’ve named an island after one soldier, there’s every chance we can rename our capital after the person we owe everything to.’ Former Falklands policeman Graham Didlick, now a battlefield tour guide, said: ‘I would be open to the idea of changing Stanley’s name in honour of Margaret Thatcher. She was a great woman. It is highly likely that if she wasn’t in power when Argentina invaded the Falklands I wouldn’t be here today.’ Former defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth said: ‘It is clearly a matter for the islanders but it would be a very nice tribute, and wholly appropriate. ‘It would also annoy [Argentina’s] President Kirchner, which on its own is a good reason for doing it.’ There have been calls for a statue to be erected to Lady Thatcher in Parliament Square, where Sir Winston Churchill is commemorated. Mr Rosindell said: ‘There is an empty space in one corner of Parliament Square and it would be entirely appropriate for a statue to be erected to Lady Thatcher.’ Another suggestion was for Lady Thatcher to occupy the vacant plinth in Trafalgar Square. John Muxworthy, Lieutenant Commander on the Canberra during the Falklands conflict, said: ‘Let’s have a full-scale statue next to Nelson to recognise that she was at the heart of the nation.’ Lord Tebbit said: ‘I think it would be appropriate for her to be honoured in the centre of London. She could be in Trafalgar Square, where Nelson could keep an eye on her.’ Lady Thatcher is one of only four former prime ministers to be recognised with a statue in the members’ lobby of the House of Commons. The statue, which joined Churchill, Attlee and Lloyd George, was approved only after a change in the rules which previously barred depictions of living figures in the small lobby. Yesterday a single daffodil had been placed at the foot of the statue with a small card bearing the hand-written message: ‘You were an inspiration to women.’ Caricature: A star of television satire Spitting Image says he was inspired by Mrs Thatcher as Prime Minister . Spitting Image impressionist Steve Nallon yesterday paid tribute to Lady Thatcher, saying the hit show would never have existed without her. Nallon, 52, impersonated the handbag-wielding Prime Minister on the satirical ITV show from 1984 to 1990. He found fame with his cross-dressing caricature of Mrs Thatcher, and portrayed her as a tyrant who used urinals and loathed the French. But he said his upbringing in a working-class Tory family meant his grandmother never watched the programme. Nallon said: ‘My grandmother got very cross. I came from a working-class Tory background and my grandmother refused to watch Spitting Image and only watched That’s Life. But I understood strong independent women because I had been brought up by them, and I tried to do her as real as possible. ‘If it was not for Margaret Thatcher, Spitting Image would not have existed.’ Nallon added: ‘The conviction of the woman – I had genuinely forgotten, because I have not done her for a long time, how she had the attitude coming straight through. She didn’t hide. ‘She was not known for having a sense of humour. Even her friends admitted that side to her character. I don’t think she would have got it. ‘She never understood anyone who didn’t agree with her, and that included comedians.’ ..........................................................................................................................................................

"A girl of 11 was sold to a child trafficker who branded her with his initial, a court heard yesterday. Mohammed Karrar, 38, also loaned her to abusers around the country for £600 an hour, it was alleged. Over five years she was repeatedly raped by large groups of men in what she described as ‘torture sex’, the jury was told. Seven men of Pakistani origin and two from North Africa are accused of 79 offences against six vulnerable white British girls. The charges include child rape, sexual trafficking and child prostitution. In the dock: Kamar Jamil, Akhtar Dogar, Anjum Dogar, Assad . Hussain, Mohammed Karrar, Bassam Karrar, Mohammed Hussain, Zeeshan Ahmed . and Bilal Ahmed are accused of abusing vulnerable girls as young as 11 . over the course of eight years in Oxford. They all deny the charges . Noel Lucas QC, prosecuting, said . Karrar – known as Egyptian Mo – bought the youngest victim from an . unnamed man just after her 11th birthday. He befriended her with gifts of perfume and hard drugs but then began to beat her up and raped her, the Old Bailey was told. He branded her with one of her hair . pins, which he had twisted into the shape of an ‘M’ and heated with a . cigarette lighter. It left a scar on her left buttock. ‘He regarded her as his property,’ Mr Lucas said. ‘He showed her no regard. If she had the temerity to resist, he beat her. ‘He branded her to make her his . property and to ensure others knew about it.’ At the age of 12 she was . introduced to Karrar’s brother Bassam, 33, who is also accused of raping . her. The girl ‘describes the Karrars as . sick sex monsters’, Mr Lucas said. ‘They were always talking about sex . and spoke about women in a vile manner. ‘Mohammed Karrar liked her to dress up and act out role play. Both brothers used to beat her.’ From the age of 12 the girl was sold . to groups of Asian men who violently raped her in private homes and . guesthouses around Oxford and elsewhere. Sometimes she was injected with . heroin or given date drugs to ensure she complied with the gang’s sick . demands, it was alleged. Mr Lucas added: ‘It became routine for . her to be taken to various locations, houses and hotels by the Karrar . brothers so she could treat their guests. She would be made to dress up, . wear very short skirts and a bikini top, do her hair and put on lots of . make-up. The jury of seven men and five women at the Old Bailey were told that the men targeted care homes and schools to find their victims . By the end of the evening she would . have been sexually used and abused by all the men. She would be so . drugged up as to be unable to feel the pain.’ Just after her 12th birthday the girl . told Karrar she was carrying his child. He allegedly beat her up and . then took her to a house in Reading where she was given a ‘backroom . abortion’ using a crochet hook. On other occasions Karrar raped the girl in the living room of her own home as her father slept in another room, it was said. Sometimes his friends would arrive at . her house and they would allegedly rape her too. The girl, who came from . a troubled family, naively believed ‘Mo’ loved her and was going to . marry her when she was 16, the court heard. During a trip to the Lake District in 2007, when she was 14, she is said to have been called by Karrar on her mobile phone. David Hughes, a social worker, answered and Karrar allegedly asked to speak to her.

"An Australian doctor could be struck off for refusing to abort a baby girl because the child's parents only wanted to have a boy. Mark Hobart said the couple's request to terminate the 19-week-old foetus 'offended my moral conscience' and refused to consider carrying out the procedure. But officials claim he had a duty to refer the couple to another doctor for help and advice - and now he could have his medical licence revoked following an investigation into his conduct. Controversy: GP Mark Hobart refused to abort a 19-week-old foetus whose parents did not want to have a daughter (file photo) Dr Hobart, 55, has been practising as a GP in Sunshine, a suburb of Melbourne, for nearly three decades. He revealed earlier this year that a couple of Indian origin had asked him to abort their unborn daughter because they only wanted a boy. The doctor, who is a devout Catholic and a former activist in the conservative Democratic Labour Party, refused the request for ethical reasons. However, under Victoria state law abortion is permitted up to 24 weeks of pregnancy, and doctors who object to the practice are obliged to refer their patients elsewhere. Dr Hobart claims he does not know any doctors who would agree to perform a sex-selective abortion. Home: Dr Hobart, a devout Catholic, works in the suburbs of Melbourne, pictured . 'It's very wrong, I don't know any doctor in Victoria that would be willing to refer a woman that wanted to have an abortion just because of gender at 19 weeks,' he told Nine News. 'I refused to refer the patient because there was no medical reason to do it and it offended my moral conscience.' But when he went public with his story in April, the Medical Board of Victoria launched an investigation following a complaint from board members that he had failed his patients. Officials told him in a letter that his 'professional conduct' had been questioned, although neither the woman herself nor her husband lodged a complaint against him. Dr Hobart said: 'I think it demonstrates the problem with abortion law that stops doctors from using their conscience whether it is appropriate or not.' The woman underwent an abortion with a different doctor a few days after seeing her GP. However, when she became pregnant again this year she decided not to find out the sex of the baby before it was born. Sex selection is widely considered taboo in developed countries, but is so popular in parts of Asia that there are now many more boys than girls being born in countries such as China, India and South Korea.","Mark Hobart approached by Indian woman who was 19 weeks pregnant .

"Infowars founder Alex Jones has been ridiculed live on British television by host who called him an 'idiot' and 'the worst person [he'd] ever interviewed.' Jones was on BBC One’s Sunday Politics with The Times columnist David Aaronovitch to discuss the secretive Bilderberg Conference, which has been taking place over the past week in England. The controversial radio host began outlining some of his more outlandish theories of governments plotting to 'disappear people' when he was abruptly cut off. Scroll down for video . Confrontation: U.S. radio host Alex Jones (right) was on BBC One’s Sunday Politics with Andrew Neil (left) to discuss the secretive Bilderberg Conference, which has been taking place over the past week near Watford . As Neil, 64, and Aaronovitch discussed the oft-maligned meeting of the world's most influential and elite power players, Jones, 39, ranted loudly about his conspiracy theories until Neil cut him off by ending the segment. But not before Neil shared his own feelings. 'You are the worst person I've ever interviewed. David, thank you for being with us. It's gone half past 11. You're watching the Sunday Politics,' he said. The presenter then added, ‘We have an idiot on the program today' and circled his ear indicating that Jones is crazy. In the moments leading up to Neil's abrupt send-off, Jones shouted his conspiratorial rallying cry as the bemused Aaronovitch sat by the wayside. ‘Hey listen, I'm here to warn people, you keep telling me to shut up,' said Jones, between shouts directing people to his website 'Infowars.com.' Astonished: Veteran broadcaster Andrew Neil labelled Mr Jones as 'the worst person I've ever interviewed' BBC show: Andrew Neil (left) was joined by Alex Jones (centre right) and David Aaronovitch (far right) 'This isn't a game,' shouted the Texan. 'Our government, the US, is building FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) camps. ‘We have an NDAA (National Defense . Authorization Act) where they disappear people now. You have this arrest . for public safety, life in prison. It's basically off with their heads, . disappear them. ‘Take them away. Infowars.com! Liberty is rising. Liberty is rising.

You're crazy, thinking the public doesn't know. You're crazy, thinking the public isn't waking up.’ 'You are the worst person I've ever interviewed. We have an idiot on the program today' Andrew Neil . Mr Jones also told the program that the creation of the Euro was a 'Nazi German plan' and said Bilderberg, also a Nazi concoction, is 'heavily involved in the EU plan'. He added: ‘We have forced them from cover to admit they’re puppeteers above the major parties.' Neil later tweeted, 'The moment Alex Jones knew he was no longer on air he stopped.' Meanwhile, a headline at Infowars.com now reads 'Alex Jones Storms BBC, Confronts Bilderberg Member.' The Bilderberg Conference is an international group of politicians, business leaders and academics who meet behind closed doors - this year at a luxury country hotel near Watford, Hertfordshire. Piers Morgan has felt the roar of Alex Jones on live television. Morgan, 48, brought the radio talk show host onto his CNN show in January to explain why he thought the journalist should be banned from the U.S. for his views on gun control. The topic had been the focus of Morgan's prime-time shows for a period following the December 14 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Jones, however, spent nearly all of the time screaming at Morgan at the top of his lungs, calling him a 'redcoat foreigner' and threatening revolution if anyone tried to 'take our guns.' Morgan later wrote about the confrontation in the Mail On Sunday, saying Mr Jones was 'ranting and raving like a gorilla at the zoo who’s just seen the morning bucket of bananas arrive'.

"Photographs and steamy messages that Johnny Weir sent to men he met online while married to husband Victor Voronov have emerged, in the latest revelation in their bitter divorce battle. The skater-turned-Olympic commentator met men on Grindr, a gay social network that shows men if they are near other members, and sent them full-front naked selfies, according to Radar. The images and messages are just the latest revelations in a messy divorce case between 29-year-old Weir and his husband of two years, lawyer Victor Voronov. In messages reportedly obtained by Radar, a man who identified himself as Weir asked another Grindr member if he lives nearby, although the location is not known. Scroll down for video . Bitter battle: Johny Weir, right, and his husband of two years, Victor Voronov, left, are divorcing - and amid the split it has been claimed that Weir messaged other men through gay social network, Grindr . Weir allegedly told him: 'I'm a figure skater. We have a show here… What are you looking for here.' The man, who has not been identified, responded: 'Cool. You must have strong legs.' Weir also reportedly sent an image showing his reflection in a mirror. Voronov has also claimed he has an image showing his ex's penis, Radar reported - but Weir has previously said he is not worried about such images surfacing. 'The worst that he could do is post naked photos that we have between each other and I look flawless,' he told Access Hollywood last month. Weir filed for divorce from Voronov, whom he married at the end of 2011 after just months of dating, in February while working as a commentator for NBC at the Sochi Olympics. Nasty divorce: Weir, pictured naked on his show Be Good Johnny Weir, was accused by Vornonov of sending  nude photos and steamy messages to men online, and his husband also has nude images of him . Nasty divorce: Weir said he was not concerned about his ex sharing naked images of him following the split. He claimed Voronov physically and emotionally abused him . The split has sparked a series of bitter digs - from Weir claiming Voronov destroyed his beloved Birkin bags, and Voronov claiming his ex sent text messages to gay porn star Michael Lucas and engaged in threesomes. Most recently, Voronov accused his estranged husband of sending a 'hateful' and 'disgusting' email and filed court papers saying Weir had violated a temporary restraining order by sending the email. 'Johnny sent Victor a disgusting, hateful email which violated the no contact order as part of the temporary restraining order he got last week,' a source told Radar. Voronov had the restraining order put in place after an incident on March 5 in which Weir allegedly hit him on the arm and threw a wooden Russian doll at him. 'So on Monday, Victor filed a police . report with cops in Rutherford, New Jersey,' the source added. 'Johnny could be in very serious legal trouble if the judge finds . him in contempt for violating terms of the temporary restraining order.' Exes: Voronov has claimed that Weir cheated on him throughout the relationship and said Weir recently sent him a 'hateful' email that violated a temporary restraining order he had out against his ex . Pettiness aside: The couple's bickering revolved around ownership of designer bags and other valuables including a Faberge egg. Voronov at one point claimed his figure skater husband held their dog Tema hostage . Voronov, 29, claims Weir committed multiple acts of adultery - . including an affair with an unidentified Chicago club owner. He also says Weir is holding their dog Tema . hostage. In legal . documents obtained by TMZ, Voronov alleges Weir forced him out . of the closet and that he married him because . his life with a Georgetown-educated lawyer would make compelling . reality TV. In addition to the allegations of adultery and cruelty, Voronov is also requesting a judge to force Weir to return property the lawyer claims the Olympian took from him. These include 20 furs - including a $125,000 coat made from sable - a crocodile Celine bag, 40 Balenciaga bags, one green and one orange Hermes Birkin and 12 Chanel bags. He is also claiming temporary support and legal fees. Olympic favorite: Weir was a hit as he commentated on the Sochi Olympics with Tara Lipinski earlier this year - but he has said that behind the scenes he was struggling with his demanding and emotionally abusive husband . A source close to Weir told TMZ that the property Voronov is requesting was the Winter Olympic commentators before their marriage. The source also added that Weir 'categorically denies' the adultery allegations. In an interview with Access Hollywood, Weir made his own swipes at his ex, claiming his non-practicing attorney husband was often abusive towards him and relied on his money. He claimed he was struggling with a 'personal hell' of an emotionally and physically abusive partner. 'Sochi was one of the hardest times in my life,' he said. 'When I was on the broadcasting, I escaped my own personal hell that I was living in. 'My husband was behaving very erratically. The majority of the time off camera I was in tears. I was on the phone. I was fighting. I was not in a good place.' Happier times: Voronov and Weir on their wedding day in 2011 and (right) out and about in Manhattan . He added that their fights involved wrestling - and that it sometimes got out of control, including the incident in which he bit Voronov, who called the police. A picture of the alleged bite appeared on TMZ and shows a deep gash on a man's forearm. Despite the fall out, however, the couple appeared together in a New Jersey court last month and a judge agreed to dismiss the case. Weir announced their divorce on Twitter two weeks ago, writing: 'It is with great sadness that I announce that my husband and I are no longer together. My heart hurts and I wish him well.' Despite the rocky relationship, Voronov said on his Twitter shortly afterwards that he had not been aware that Weir had filed for divorce until the announcement. 'Shocked by the abrupt ending of my marriage and am dealing with the trauma including multiple things I am just now becoming aware of...' he wrote. Champion on ice: Weir competed in the 2010 . Vancouver Winter Olympics, finishing sixth place in the men's single . competition, and was a hit in his first commentary stint at Sochi . He added: 'Yes. I'd like to confirm, It's true: I am only now finding out that my husband @johnnygweir filed for divorce from me months ago.' Voronov's spokesperson, Wendy Feldman, added: 'It is our extreme hope and desire that this divorce could have been handled amicably. Not only is Victor heartbroken but he is now humiliated.' Weir officially came out as gay in his memoir Welcome to My World in 2011, citing a recent string of gay suicides as his reason to be open about his sexuality. On New Year's Eve that year, he married Voronov. But in February, he told Access Hollywood that the relationship could be fiery. 'A marriage between two guys is different than what I imagine a marriage between a man and a woman [to be],' he said. 'I mean, we're both constantly trying to fight to wear the pants in the relationship. It's constant fireworks. It's very boom, boom, boom.'","Weir filed for divorce from Victor Voronov - his husband of two years - in February, while in Sochi commenting on the Olympics .

"A shocking video has shown the moment a father-of-two was Tased by police and arrested for refusing to give his name as he waited to pick up his kids after school. Christopher Lollie, 28, was arrested after the incident in St Paul, Minnesota on January 31, but after witness statements and the video, they have now dropped the charges, he said. Lollie was sitting near his children's school after working an overnight cleaning shift when a security guard approached him and told him to move because it was a private area. Not seeing any signs indicating this, Lollie refused and the security guard called police, the Pioneer Press reported. As Lollie got up and headed to the school, officers arrived and caught up with him. Scroll down for video . Arrest: Chris Lollie, 28, was Tased and arrested after he refused to give his name to police after he was caught sitting in a private area in downtown St Paul. He said no signs indicated it was private . Doting dad: He had been waiting to collect his two children, pictured, and their friends saw the altercation . On the video taken on his cell phone - which he says he only got back recently after it was confiscated by the police - Lollie can be heard calmly asking why they need his name as he walks. 'Why do I have to let you know who I am?' Lollie asks the officer. 'I don't have to let you know who I am if I haven't broken any laws.' When a female officer, later identified as Lori Hayne, refuses to say what he has done wrong and repeatedly asks for his name, he responds: 'The problem is I'm black.... I didn't do anything wrong.' As they near his children's pick-up point, another two officers, Michael Johnson and Bruce Schmidt, approached them and can be heard asking him to put his hands behind his back. Again Lollie insists he has done nothing wrong. Stopped: A female police officer, Lori Hayne, is captured on Lollie's cellphone demanding his name . Altercation: Two male officers, Michael Johnson and Bruce Schmidt, pictured, then approach them and a scuffle ensues. He is eventually knocked to the ground, Tased and taken into custody . Moments later, he is apparently knocked to the ground and the footage goes dark, but he can be heard screaming for help as he is held on the ground. One of the officers orders him to put his hands behind his back 'otherwise, it's going to get ugly'. Taken in: The multiple charges against Lollie, pictured in his mugshot, have now been dropped . He claims that police Tased him, put their hands on his throat and ripped his jacket open. Police Chief Thomas Smith explained in a statement that police had responded to a report of Lollie trespassing in a private area and had attempted to talk to him - but he wouldn't cooperate. In their report, police said Lollie had been 'actively resisting by attempting to pull his arm away' and 'began to forcefully try to shove past us as he was pulling away from us'. When he was 'becoming uncontrollable', they used the Taser on him, the report said. 'They used the force necessary to safely take him into custody,' Smith's statement said. Dave Titus, St. Paul Police Federation president, added: 'These three cops in the skyway, you couldn't get nicer individuals. This guy was acting like a jerk.' Lollie was charged with trespassing, disorderly conduct and obstructing legal process, but all counts were dismissed on July 31 after Lollie's attorney showed the video and witness statements in court. He told the Pioneer Press that when the police approached him, he tried hard to remain calm 'because I know if I do anything outside of these bounds, they could really do some damage to me'. He said that it was heartbreaking knowing that some of his four-year-old daughter's friends and teachers had seen the altercation. 'One of the kids in the class that saw what happened (later) said, ""When I saw them doing that to Allahna's daddy, it made my heart feel so sad"",' Lollie said. He said he is considering a lawsuit.","Security called cops on Chris Lollie after he refused to leave a private area in downtown St Paul - but he argued no signs indicated it was private .
