"(CNN) -- Maria Sharapova kept alive her hopes of finishing the year as world No. 1 when beating Italy's Sara Errani 6-3 6-2 in her opening match of the WTA Tour Championships in Istanbul. The Russian, who won the event in 2004, has called attaining the status her 'biggest priority this week' at the season-ending tournament. The 25-year-old needs to win at least two matches in Istanbul while hoping that Victoria Azarenka, the Belarusian who currently holds the title of the world's best, slips up in the Red Group if she is to finish the year on top. Sharapova, whose victory margin was identical to her only previous meeting with Errani, who she beat in the final of this year's French Open, was delighted to make an impact at the WTA Championships after injury forced her early withdrawal last year. Read: Sharapova overpowers Errani to win French Open . ""This is such a great feeling, not only to make it here but to feel good physically,"" the World No.2 told the WTA's official website. ""When you're out here and feeling good it's such a big motivation, and it's the last tournament of the year too, so while I'm going to enjoy some time off after this, right now it's all business."" Sharapova is competing in the White Group, where Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska earned her first career win against Petra Kvitova at the fourth attempt as the defending champion lost the opening match of the championships. The Wimbledon runner-up won 6-3 6-2 in a match where the Czech, looking to become the first woman to win back-to-back titles since Belgium's Justine Henin in 2007, produced 41 unforced errors in contrast to just five from her opponent. ""I was not very comfortable on court and I didn't feel pretty well,"" said Kvitova, who cut a dejected figure afterwards. The only Red Group game of the day found Serena Williams playing her first match since winning the U.S. Open in August and she maintained her winning run as she beat Angelique Kerber, the German making her debut at the event for the world's top eight players. The Wimbledon, U.S. Open and Olympic champion won 6-4 6-1 against the left-hander who had inflicted Williams' only defeat in her 27 matches preceding the tie, with Kerber winning in Cincinnati in August. The victory, which quickly reached its conclusion once Williams broke for 3-1 in the second set, was greeted with huge enthusiasm by those watching inside Istanbul's Sinan Erdem Dome. ""I've never been here but I never knew I had so many Turkish supporters,"" Williams told wtatennis.com. ""It was really an honor to hear the fans go crazy and be really loud when I walked out. It made me have this smile on my face, and an even bigger smile inside."" On Wednesday, Williams is scheduled to play first against Li Na, the former French Open champion from China, while Azarenka enters the action when taking on Kerber, who broke into the top five in the rankings for the first time this week. ""Every match here will be tough - I obviously have great champions in the group,"" said Azarenka. ""It's challenging, definitely, but I'm looking forward to it.""","Maria Sharapova beat Italy's Sara Errani in straight sets to win opening match in White Group .

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer is looking to the comforts of home as he continues his bid to hold the year-end world No. 1 ranking for the first time since 2009. The Swiss tennis star needs to defend his title in Basel to avoid dropping points in the run-up to the season-ending finals in London next month, with Novak Djokovic seeking to regain his place at the top. ""It is just so great to play at home as world number one after the season I've had,"" the 31-year-old told reporters following Monday's first-round win over Benjamin Becker at the Swiss Indoors hard-court event. ""It's a wonderful feeling to be here playing at the top of my game. Sometimes things just all come together."" Federer, playing for the first time since losing to Andy Murray in the Shanghai semifinals earlier this month, won 7-5 6-3 against the 83rd-ranked German -- a late replacement for injured Frenchman Jeremy Chardy. ""He broke me at 2-3 but I was able to get it straight back. It all went so fast at the end, but the first set was really tough,"" said Federer, who has won the Basel title five times and been runner-up on three occasions in 12 previous appearances. The Wimbledon champion now has more than 300 career weeks at No. 1 -- the first man to do so -- but faces a difficult task to hold off second-ranked Djokovic, who won the Shanghai title and has the chance of picking up more points due to his lackluster end to 2011. The Serbian has taken this week off ahead of the men's season's penultimate event, the Paris Masters -- which Federer also won last year before triumphing in the ATP Tour World Finals. With U.S. Open champion Murray pulling out of Basel for the second year in a row, this time due to a back problem, Federer faces a relatively weak field. The London 2012 silver medalist next takes on either Brazil's Thomaz Bellucci or Japan's Go Soeda, and would not play a top-10 player until the final should his 2009 U.S. Open conqueror Juan Martin del Potro make it that far. The eighth-ranked Argentine won this month's event in Vienna in his first singles tournament since September's U.S. Open, having suffered a recurrence of his wrist injury during the Davis Cup semifinal against the Czech Republic. Meanwhile, Tomas Berdych -- who led the Czechs into the November 16-18 final against Spain -- has become the sixth player to qualify for the eight-man season-ending event in London. Berdych, who won his eighth career title in Stockholm on Sunday, follows Djokovic, Federer, Murray, David Ferrer and Rafael Nadal -- who is unlikely to take his place at the showpiece event due to his knee injury. Meanwhile, the women's season-ending WTA Championships start on Tuesday in Turkey, with Maria Sharapova beginning her bid to wrest the No. 1 ranking from Victoria Azarenka. The Russian will take on Italy's Sara Errani in a repeat of June's French Open final, which Sharapova won, while defending champion Petra Kvitova will launch the tournament against Agnieszka Radwanska in the other Group B match. ""Unfortunately last year I was a bit injured and wasn't able to play 100%, so it's nice coming in this year knowing I'm ready,""said Sharapova. Third-ranked Serena Williams, who cannot topple Azarenka despite her victories at Wimbledon, the Olympics and the U.S. Open, will play Germany's Angelique Kerber in Tuesday's other match. U.S. Open finalist Azarenka, also in Group A along with China's Li Na, needs to win two matches to seal the year-end No. 1 spot. The Belorussian has won her past two tournaments following a surprise defeat by Kerber in the Tokyo quarterfinals.","Defending champion Roger Federer wins opening match at Swiss Indoors event .

"(CNN) -- Kei Nishikori made history as he became the first home player to capture the Japan Open after a three-set win over Milos Raonic Sunday. The 22-year-old beat the Canadian 7-6 3-6 6-0 to win his second career title, but his first since Delray Beach in 2008. ""I cannot believe I won the tournament, but at the same time, I feel that I'm happy I was able to do this,"" he told the official ATP Tour website. Nishikori, who beat second seed Tomas Berdych in the quarterfinals, said he had gained renewed confidence from that victory after feeling the pressure of home expectation. ""I have not been able to play well in Japan until now, so I always thought perhaps I was not mentally strong enough to do so,"" Nishikori added. ""But the match against Berdych, something changed. I was able to play much better yesterday and today."" The 21-year-old Raonic, who put out defending champion Andy Murray in the semifinals, recovered to tie the match at one set all. But in the decider he was broken early and never recovered as Nishikori clinched a famous victory. Meanwhile in the final of the China Open in Beijing, top seed Novak Djokovic accounted for Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France 7-6 6-2 to claim his 32nd career crown. The Serbian, who is challenging Roger Federer for the World No.1 spot, took just one hour 42 minutes to win his third straight title at the event. Tsonga started strongly to break the favorite, but Djokovic retrieved it before winning the first set tiebreak. The second set was more one-sided as Djokovic broke in the third game and repeated the trick to close out the victory. In the accompanying WTA event, top seed and World No.1 Victoria Azarenka swept past second seed Maria Sharapova of Russia in straight sets in the final. The Belarus star won 6-3 6-1 to claim a winning check for $848,000 as she took the China title at the fourth attempt.","Kei Nishikori makes tennis history at Japan Open .

"(CNN) -- Andy Murray maintained his bid to win a third successive Shanghai Masters title with a comfortable win over Roger Federer in Saturday's semifinal. The Scot wasted little time in overpowering the current world No.1, easing to a straight sets 6-4 6-4 victory in one hour 38 minutes. The 25-year-old was gifted a crucial break in the first set when Federer served three double faults on the bounce in the fifth game. Murray took full advantage of the uncharacteristic slip, closing out the set without alarm. Federer was put under pressure again at the start of the second, saving seven break points to win the opening game. But it wasn't long before Murray's aggressive returning paid dividends. At 40-0 up in the fifth game, the 31-year-old Swiss was cruising before Murray fought back to earn a break point which he took with a devastating forehand return. Two rain delays in the second set failed to upset the Scot's rhythm who calmly served out the match. ""[Federer] didn't serve that well for him tonight so I was able to be very aggressive on his second serve,"" Murray said afterwards. ""He maybe slowed down his first serve a little bit so I was able to take a few more chances on the first serve. Obviously that helped. But, yeah, I went for it like I did the last few times I played against him."" Murray will meet Novak Djokovic in Sunday's final -- the Serb completing an easy win over Tomas Berdych earlier in the day. The world No.2, who has yet to drop a set at the tournament, broke the Czech's first service game to immediately gain the upper hand. The Serb claimed another break of serve early in the second to canter home 6-3 6-4 in 85 minutes. ""Tomas is in great form in the last couple of months. He's always a difficult player to play against on any surface because he has a very powerful serve and great forehand,"" Djokovic said. ""I played tactically right. I was putting a lot of returns into the court, making a lot of pressure on his serve. On the other hand, I was serving well when I needed to,"" he added. Djokovic currently leads Murray 8-7 in head-to-head match ups, but the Scot looks favorite given his recent successes over the Serb in the semifinal of the Olympics tournament in August and in the final of the U.S. Open last month. ""I've known him for 14, 15 years now. We've obviously had some incredibly tough matches which can maybe test a friendship. But we've always been, I think, pretty respectful of each other,"" Murray said.","Briton secures place in Shanghai Masters final with a 6-4 6-4 win over Roger Federer .

"(CNN) -- For the first time in two years there will be a winner of a Masters 1000 event who is not ranked in the ""Big Four"" after Andy Murray suffered a shock defeat in Paris on Thursday. World No. 3 Murray, who was the highest ranked player remaining in the draw, squandered a match point before going on to lose to Poland's Jerzy Janowicz. Halloween horror for 'Darth' Djokovic . Murray had been expected to lift the trophy in the French capital after Novak Djokovic's defeat and the withdrawals of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. But he somehow contrived to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory after allowing Janowicz, ranked 69 in the world, to emerge triumphant. The hard-hitting Pole looked to be heading out of the tournament when Murray served for the match in the second set. But the Olympic and U.S. Open champion fluffed his lines and from serving for the match at 7-5 5-4 and 40-30, he capitulated in dramatic circumstances to lose the second set 7-6. The Briton was then swept aside 6-2 in the final set and will now head to the end of season finals in London which begins on Monday. It is the third consecutive tournament where Murray has lost after holding match points. Djokovic beats Murray in classic Shanghai final . Murray was beaten by Canada's Milos Raonic in the last four at the Japan Open in Tokyo after holding two chances to win, while he also went down to Djokovic in Shanghai after failing to convert five opportunities. ""I didn't play a particularly good game and missed a couple of shots that I would have hoped to have made,"" Murray said on the ATP website. ""He probably gained some confidence from that and started playing better. He played a good tie-break, played aggressive. ""I have to make sure I tighten that up next week, if I get that opportunity in the matches. Make sure I don't let it happen at The O2."" Janowicz, who had already beaten Philipp Kohlschreiber and Marin Cilic before defeating Murray, has enjoyed a stellar year and will now hope to make the semifinals when he faces Janko Tipsarevic -- who clinched the eighth and final place for the season-ending championships. ""In the beginning of this year, I had many changes in my life,"" Janowicz said. ""I changed the racquet. This racquet which I'm using right now is helping me a lot. Even if I have some weak days, this racquet is actually helping me. So this is one change. ""The second one is, I have a new fitness coach this year, and he's helping me a lot. I'm doing a lot of fitness. When I'm at home I'm actually doing more fitness than tennis. ""So there is this other change. My behavior on the court is also a little bit different. I decided not to give up, whatever the situation is. I'm fighting right now for every single ball."" Federer to surrender world No. 1 ranking after pulling out of Paris Masters . There was also another shock as home favorite Michael Llodra overcame seventh seed Juan Martin Del Potro of Argentina. Former U.S. Open champion Del Potro, who has already booked his place at next week's end of season finals in London, went down 6-4 6-3 to the 32-year-old left-hander. Tipsarevic, who played in London last year as an alternate when Murray pulled out with an injury, ensured his second appearance by defeating Juan Monaco 6-3 3-6 6-3. ""The World Tour Finals last year was one of my best experiences ever on the tennis court. ""I was always dreaming of playing the World Tour Finals and I'm excited to be back there,"" the Serbian said. Elsewhere, the 2005 Paris champion Tomas Berdych overcame big-serving South African Kevin Anderson 1-6 6-3 6-4 to secure his place in the quarterfinals. Berdych, who will also play in London next week, will now face France's Gilles Simon after his opponent, Japan's Kei Nishikori, withdrew with an injury. World No. 8 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga guaranteed his place in London after defeating Spain's 11th-ranked Nicolas Almagro 7-6 (7-4) 7-6 (7-3). ""It's really important for me to have qualified,"" said the Frenchman, who will next face world No. 5 David Ferrer following the Spaniard's three-set win over Stanislas Wawrinka. ""With the big four at the moment, it's not easy to get rewards in tennis, so for me this is one of my rewards. It feels good to be a part of it. ""I have some great memories from last year where I played the final against Roger. It was huge for me, one of the big moments of my career."" Canada's world No. 13 Milos Raonic was dumped out at the third-round stage after going down 6-3 7-6 (7-1) to Djokovic's conqueror, American Sam Querrey -- who will play Llodra in the last eight.","Andy Murray beaten by Poland's Jerzy Janowicz.in third round of Paris Masters .

He made it through to the semifinals at Metz but was beaten in the first round in Stockholm earlier in the week after losing to world 435 Patrik Rosenholm.

""I really wanted to reach 500 wins, it was a goal for me at the start of the year,"" said Haas, who won in Vienna last year. ""To do it means a lot. It's been such a hard road, I had to play some good tennis. ""No one gives you anything on the ATP. And to do it here in Vienna where I won the title was spectacular.

Sharapova triumphed 6-0 6-3 against Stosur, surrendering just five points in an opening set that lasted only 21 minutes.

""I knew coming in I was already going to be in the semis, but I didn't want to lose. I wanted to do the right things today and I did them.""

Murray was extended to three sets in beating Switzerland's Stanislas Wawrinka for this 50th win on the ATP Tour this year and the 10th in a row. Djokovic needed less than an hour to beat Austria's Juergen Melzer 6-1 6-2 at one of his favorite venues. He won the China Open title in 2009 and 2010 but did not defend his crown last year. The Serbian, beaten by Murray to lose his U.S. Open crown last month, converted all four of his break points and fired 12 aces in a near flawless display. ""The serve was great tonight. It's one of the best serving matches I have had in my career, so that's a positive sign. I will try to keep on going,"" he told the official ATP Tour website. Djokovic will play Germany's Florian Mayer as he bids to reach his ninth final on tour this year. Spain's Feliciano Lopez will play third seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France in the other semifinal Saturday. In the women's draw, Li Na beat defending champion Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland 6-4 6-2 to secure reach the semifinals and seal her place in the season-ending WTA Championships in Istanbul. Top seed Victoria Azarenka and Maria Sharapova are also in the last four. World No.3 Murray looked set to wrap up an easy win over Wawrinka, one of his victims as he won Olympic gold in London, when he took the first set with two breaks of service. But Wawrinka hit back to force a decider before the Britain pulled away again with two more breaks to wrap up the match in two hours 50 minutes. He will face Milos Raonic of Canada for a place in the final. The Canadian, beaten by Murray in the fourth round at the U.S. Open, saved a match point before beating Janko Tipsarevic 6-7 6-2 7-6. ""I'll try to do what I did in New York. I got a lot of returns in play. Once I was in the point, I was able to dictate a lot of them so I'll try and do the same tomorrow,"" Murray said as he looked forward to their last four clash. Home hopes were kept alive by eighth seed Kei Nishikori, who became the first Japanese player to reach the semifinals of their home open. He upset second seed Tomas Berdych 7-5, 6-4 Friday and will now take on Marcos Baghdatis, who beat qualifier Dmitry Tursunov 6-2 6-4.","Andy Murray reaches semifinal of Japan Open in Tokyo .

"(CNN) -- Venus Williams claimed her first singles title in more than two years with a straight sets victory over Monica Niculescu of Romania Sunday to win the Luxembourg Open. The 32-year-old American has slipped down the rankings after battling SjÃ¶gren's syndrome, an auto-immune disorder that causes fatigue and joint pain. But the seven-time Grand Slam champion put that behind her with a 6-2 6-3 scoreline in the final for her 44th career singles crown on the WTA Tour. Younger sister Serena tweeted: My eyes are watering up because I am so proud of my sister @Venuseswilliams so proud of you sis congrats on your tournament win! I . The pair had combined together in the London Olympics to win the women's doubles gold for the third straight Games, with Venus showing signs she was returning to her best. A semifinal victory over rising young German player Andrea Petkovic confirmed her form and fitness in a two-hour 38 minutes battle Saturday and Niculescu proved an easier victim in the title match. She made a string of errors to lose in the Luxembourg final for the second straight year. Serena Williams is in the field for the WTA Championships in Istanbul next week, her first tournament since winning the U.S. Open title last month. Venus will go ahead to prepare for the 2013 season and the opening Grand Slam of the season in Australia. ""Coming to the tournament this week I was just trying to play well. I didn't know if I could win this event, so to stand here as the winner is a wonderful way for me to end the year, "" she told the official WTA website. ""It really makes me look forward to next year as well."" Meanwhile, in the final of the Kremlin Cup in Moscow, former World No.1 Caroline Wozniacki beat top seed Samantha Stosur of Australia 6-3 4-6 7-5 in a grueling final.

"(CNN) -- Two time defending world champion Sebastian Vettel claimed pole in the Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka for the fourth straight year Saturday ahead of Red Bull teammate Mark Webber. The German clocked the fastest time of one minute 30.839 seconds, which was 0.251 seconds faster than Webber. McLaren's Jenson Button was third quickest, but will start from eighth after having a five-place grid penalty for a gearbox change. It has promoted home hope Kamui Kobayashi to third as the home driver produced a superb last qualifying lap in his Sauber to delight the crowd. France's Romain Grosjean for Lotus will go from fourth with the second Sauber of Mexican Sergio Perez in fifth. Button's relegation has moved Ferrari's championship leader Fernando Alonso up to sixth as he bids to protect his 29-point title lead over Vettel. Lewis Hamilton, who announced his move to Mercedes this week, was a disappointing ninth fastest in the second McLaren in a further blow to his receding championship challenge. Seven-time champion Michael Schumacher, who is being replaced at Mercedes by Hamilton and will retire for the second time at the end of the season, was unable to make the top-10 shootout. Schumacher, who crashed in practice Friday, was only 13th fastest and will start from 23rd after a 10-place grid penalty for an incident in the previous round in Sinqapore. But Vettel, who stayed clear of a late qualifying crash by Kimi Raikkonen of Lotus, which held up several drivers, including Alonso and Hamilton, was in imperious form as he stepped up his title bid.

"(CNN) -- A pro-democracy activist released from a Vietnamese prison was on his way to his California home after nine months in detention, according to his family. Nguyen Quoc Quan, who holds a U.S. passport, was arrested April 17, 2012, at Ho Chi Min City's Tan Son Nhat International Airport. He was originally charged with terrorism and attempting to overthrow the government, but those charges were later reduced to subversion. His deportation Wednesday was a surprise, following the postponement of his trial last week. State media said that Nguyen, 58, of Elk Grove, California, admitted to taking part in illegal activities and was flown out Vietnam for humanitarian reasons. But the activist's wife said that when he called her before leaving Vietnam, Nguyen denied ever admitting to wrongdoing and said that he was not finished working for democracy there. Read more: Why are we still in 'Vietghanistan?' Nguyen's family and U.S.-based legal counsel welcomed the news. ""Dr. Quan's release comes as a major and wonderful surprise, given that the government has on trial 22 people right now for subversion, and recently convicted 14 others of similar charges based on protected advocacy of nonviolent democratic reform,"" said Linda Malone, a professor at William & Mary Law School in Virginia. ""There is no question that the media attention, public outrage and efforts of the State Department were critical in preventing conviction of a U.S. citizen for exercising a clearly protected human right to freedom of speech and thought,"" she said in a statement. Nguyen's wife, Ngo Mai Huong, said Nguyen had gone to Vietnam planning to visit his younger sister and talk about democracy and the rule of law. Ngo told CNN that she got a phone call early Wednesday from a U.S. consular official, who told her that she ""had better sit down"" before he delivered some news. CNN Heroes: Giving Vietnam's street kids a chance . ""I thought that it had to do with his health or that something had gone wrong at the trial,"" she said from California. ""Instead, he said my husband was on a plane headed home and I couldn't speak. I just cried and cried."" Nguyen was ""an important member of leadership"" in the Viet Tan democracy organization, says the group's spokesperson, Duy Hoang. The former high school teacher went to Vietnam in April to meet with other grassroots democracy activists, but was arrested at the airport on arrival, Duy said. According to a report published last year in the Communist Youth Union-run Tuoi Tre news, ""police caught (Nguyen) bringing documents on terrorist training to allegedly incite demonstrations in Ho Chi Minh City as well as other provinces and cities"" during festivities marking the reunification of North and South Vietnam and May Day. Vietnam's Security Ministry determined that Nguyen planned to hold a ""demonstration and terrorist activities planned by ... Viet Tan,"" said a report in the state-run Vietnam News Agency. ""The government detained him because he was opposed to them,"" said Duy. ""But when they couldn't substantiate the terrorism charges against him first they dropped them to subversion and then ultimately they just released him because the publicity and political pressure from the U.S. and politicians in Washington was too strong."" The Viet Tan group -- which has offices in California, Japan, Australia and France -- says on its website it is ""committed to peaceful, nonviolent struggle"" to defend human rights and promote democracy despite what it calls a ""backward dictatorship."" This was not the first time Quan had been detained in Vietnam. He was released in 2008 after serving six months in prison for a terrorism conviction, according to Tuoi Tre news. Viet Tan said in that case he'd actually been detained in November 2007 ""for distributing materials promoting nonviolent tactics for civil resistance."" But Nguyen appears ready to keep up his pressure for reforms. ""My husband said that even after months in prison he was better off and freer than the Vietnamese people today,"" said Ngo.

"(CNN) -- Man of the moment Andy Murray needed less than an hour to book his place in the quarterfinals of the Japan Open in Tokyo Wednesday. The defending champion beat Lukas Lacko of Slovakia 6-1 6-2 in 57 minutes at the Ariake Coliseum to book a clash against Switzerland's Stanislas Wawrinka in the last eight. It was the Scot's ninth win in a row after his U.S. Open triumph where he beat Novak Djokovic in the final in New York. Murray also won singles gold in the London Olympics, defeating Wawrinka on the way to his triumph at Wimbledon. The World No.3 was on control from the start against Lacko, breaking him twice on the way to taking the opening set and then continuing the good work in the second. ""I began the match very well, which was nice because it was long day to get on,"" Murray told the official ATP Tour website. ""I started the match almost perfect. That was important. Once I got the break in the second set, I started to play better."" Murray holds a 7-4 winning career record against Wawrinka, who beat Jeremy Chardy of France 7-6 6-7 7-5 in a tight last 16 encounter. Meanwhile, top seed Djokovic eased through his second round match at the China Open in Beijing. Like Murray, the Serbian is playing in his first tournament since Flushing Meadows, and wasted little time in beating Argentina's Carlos Berlocq in straight sets. Djokovic, who struggled past Germany's Michael Berrer in the first round, broke his opponent six times on his way to a 6-1 6-3 victory in one hour and 14 minutes. In the accompanying WTA tournament at the same venue, Russia's Maria Sharapova began with a 6-2 6-2 win over Romania's Sorana Cirstea.

"(CNN) -- Former motorcycling star Casey Stoner has ended speculation about his future by confirming he will switch to four wheels to drive in a V8 Supercar, but not before taking a sideswipe at officials and fans. The two-time world champion quit the elite MotoGP class at the end of the 2012 season, having announced his premature departure last May. ""I just fell out of love with the sport. We had a lack of respect from a lot of people around the sport and I didn't like the direction it was taking,"" he was quoted in Australia's Daily Telegraph newspaper on the same day he confirmed his new career move on Twitter. ""We got spat at (by fans), they tried to knock us off scooters going from the motor homes to the pits, everything like that."" The 27-year-old Australian said the death of Italian star Marco Simoncelli at the Malaysian Grand Prix in 2011 had also been a major factor in his decision. ""We lost a rider a couple of years ago and within a month it was like it never happened,"" Stoner claimed. ""They want to see biff and barge and they don't realize our lives are on the line. We became puppets in that world and it had nothing to do with racing."" Stoner will drive for Red Bull Racing Australia in 2013, competing in a car which won the 2010 edition of the famous Bathurst motor race. He tweeted: ""Very happy to have a chance to race with @redbullracingAU in the Dunlop Series this year. Looking forward to getting on track at Clipsal!"" Stoner, who has previously tested sports cars, will initially compete in a development series. His former arch rival in MotoGP, Italian legend Valentino Rossi has also been linked in the past with a move to four wheels with Ferrari. But seven-time champion Rossi has stayed loyal to MotoGP and will return to Yamaha for the 2013 season. Meanwhile, Stoner will carry over his famous No.27 from his former sport into motor racing. Injuries from a crash in May cost him the chance of winning a third world title last season, but he signed off for Repsol Honda with a win in front of his home fans at Philip Island in November. He started out in the 125cc class in the early 2000s before moving up to MotoGP in 2006, and won the world title the following year and again in 2011.","Motorcycling star Casey Stoner confirms his switch to sports car racing .

"(CNN) -- McLaren's Jenson Button has been hit with a five-place grid penalty ahead of this weekend's Japanese Grand Prix after a new gearbox was fitted to his car. Post-race checks on the 2009 world champion's MP4-27 car revealed a transmission issue which could not be repaired. Button's teammate and fellow Briton Lewis Hamilton was forced to retire from the Singapore Grand Prix earlier this month with an identical problem. Formula One rules state a driver must use the same gearbox for five races in a row or face a grid penalty. Hamilton has avoided any punishment as he did not finish the grand prix. Schumacher coy on Sauber switch . The 32-year-old Button has won two races this year, in Australia and Belgium, and sits sixth in the drivers' standings with 119 points. The Briton will be paired with a new driver next season, with Mexico's Sergio Perez drafted in from Sauber as a replacement for the departing Hamilton. It was announced last week Hamilton would be joining German manufacturer Mercedes on a three-year deal, ending his career-long association with McLaren. Ferrari's Fernando Alonso is the current championship leader, 29 points clear of two-time title winner Sebastian Vettel with just six races remaining.

The German has been linked with a switch to the Sauber team after it was confirmed Mexican Sergio Perez would be leaving the Swiss-based marque to replace 2008 world champion Hamilton at McLaren. ""My motivation is completely intact after the news last week,"" the 43-year-old told the sport's official website ahead of this weekend's Japanese Grand Prix. ""Especially because Suzuka is one of the season's highlights for me. I enjoy the circuit -- it has sections that challenge you as a driver like almost nowhere else."" Hamilton joins Mercedes in three-year deal . Since coming out of retirement in 2010, the former Ferrari driver has struggled to recapture his best form. He won five consecutive titles with the Italian team between 2000 and 2004, but he has registered just one podium finish since returning to the sport. On Sunday, the most-decorated driver in F1 history will have his work cut out to finish in the points as Schumacher must serve a 10-place grid penalty at Suzuka for his part in a collision which forced both he and Toro Rosso's Jean-Eric Vergne out of the Singapore Grand Prix. ""Logically, it would also be nice to achieve a sporting highlight this weekend,"" continued Schumacher. ""Although my chances are of course very limited because of my grid penalty.

"(CNN) -- Formula One world championship leader Fernando Alonso has warned his Ferrari team they must improve if he is to win the marque's first drivers' crown since 2007. Alonso finished third at the Singapore Grand Prix, extending his lead at the top of the 2012 standings to 29 points with just six races of the season to go. But the two-time world champion knows Ferrari cannot continue to rely on their rivals slipping up, after McLaren's Lewis Hamilton was forced to retire from a winning position on Sunday. ""In the end it went well, but we definitely can't go on like this,"" the Spaniard, who saw his nearest rival Sebastian Vettel of Red Bull take the checkered flag, told Ferrari's official website. ""It can't always be the case that my closest rival retires, as has happened in the last two races and we can't think of carrying on to the end of the season with qualifying sessions like yesterday's, when our performance was almost a second off the best.

Alonso, who qualified fifth fastest in Singapore, predicts tougher challenges ahead when the F1 season continues at similar Asian tracks. ""Probably this has been the most difficult circuit for us: we will find partially similar characteristics in Korea and Abu Dhabi, but I hope that by the time we get there, we will have found a way of improving the car. ""It was a very tough race physically, definitely the most tiring of the whole season; three hundred odd kilometers in this heat and such high humidity is very stressful."" Vettel, the world champion in each of the last two seasons, has moved into second place in the championship standings, ahead of Lotus' Kimi Raikkonen in third position.

"(CNN) -- Jorge Lorenzo moved closer to the MotoGP world championship on Sunday with a decisive win at the San Marino Grand Prix. The Yamaha Factory Racing rider is now 38 points clear at the top of the riders' standings with just five races remaining, after his nearest rival Dani Pedrosa crashed out on the first lap. It was an emotional weekend at the track which is now named after Marco Simoncelli, the Italian who lost his life following a crash in Malaysia in October 2011. Simoncelli's compatriot and close friend Valentino Rossi produced his best ride of the season to finish behind 2010 champion Lorenzo in second place. ""This second place is something special,"" seven-time riders' champion Rossi told BBC Sport after the 13th race of 2012. ""I have a lot of fans in Misano, my hometown is only a few minutes away, but more importantly this is in the name of Marco. ""This result is for him and for his family. I think Marco helped me to achieve this today."" It was a miserable race for Repsol Honda's Pedrosa, who had qualified for the grand prix in pole position. The first race start had been abandoned, due to Karel Abraham stalling his Ducati, before Pedrosa was forced to start from the back of the grid after experiencing a problem with his front tire. When the race eventually got underway, a nightmare Sunday for Spain's Pedrosa was completed when he was forced off the track and out of the race by Hector Barbera of the Pramac Racing Team.

"(CNN) -- In a mega moment for the man called Megatron, Detroit Lions wide receiver Calvin Johnson broke Jerry Rice's single-season record for receiving yards Saturday night against the Atlanta Falcons. Johnson set the record in the final minutes of the fourth quarter, snagging a pass from Matthew Stafford for a 26-yard gain. After the play, Johnson brought the ball to the Detroit sideline to give to his father, Calvin Johnson Sr., while the crowd erupted in a roaring ovation. ""I don't think I said anything to my dad when I gave him the ball,"" Johnson said after the game. ""I just gave him a hug. But when I think back on it, it's a special moment."" Entering Saturday's game in Detroit, Johnson needed 182 receiving yards to surpass Rice, who had a total of 1,848 yards in the 1995 season when he was with the San Francisco 49ers. Johnson finished the night with 225 yards, and now has 1,892 on the season. Rice congratulated Johnson with an in-stadium message on the Ford Field video board. Johnson said he knew when he caught the pass that he broke the record. ""The guys were telling me on the sideline I'm like 4 or 5 yards away,"" Johnson said. ""So it was just like one reception and I'm there, so I'm like, 'shoot, let's go ahead and knock this thing out.'"" Johnson broke two other NFL records Saturday. He had more than 100 yards receiving for the eighth straight game, passing Charley Henningan in 1961 and Michael Irvin in 1995. Johnson set another league mark with 10 receptions for four consecutive games. Johnson had 11 receptions Saturday. Following the game, Stafford said if someone had told him at the beginning of the year that someone would break Rice's record this season, he would point to his star wide receiver. ""Nobody goes about their business as professionally as he does,"" Stafford said. ""We're lucky to have a guy like that."" Despite the history made by Johnson, the Lions lost 31-18, their seventh straight defeat. They are in last place in the NFC. The Falcons, meanwhile, clinched home-field advantage through the NFC playoffs with their win Saturday night. Johnson now will try to reach a number that was once unthinkable: 2,000 receiving yards in a single season. The Lions finish the season at home against the Chicago Bears. But for now, despite the Lions' loss, Johnson can still put the record in perspective. ""It's an accomplishment that took a lot of work, so you can't take that thing away,"" he said.","Johnson set the new record at 1,892 receiving yards in one season .

"(CNN) -- Favorite Wild Oats XI led going into the first night of the Rolex Sydney to Hobart yacht race after fellow super maxi Wild Thing was prevented from starting on Boxing Day by race officials. Wild Oats, last year's line honors winner Ragamuffin Loyal, and Wild Thing were expected to dominate the 628-mile bluewater classic with hopes of a new race record in strong southerly winds. But race organizers, the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia (CYCA), scratched Grant Wharington's Wild Thing just three hours before the start, citing incomplete documentation. Wharington's yacht had undergone modifications to extend it to 100 feet, but they fell foul of the rules, leaving an angry skipper to vent his feelings to the media. ""We are absolutely devastated to be told at the 11th hour that we are unable to race to Hobart,"" a furious Wharington told AFP. ""We're a bit stuck for words as to why it happened, the situation, we provided the documentation -- I've got it in my hand."" Official Rolex Sydney-Hobart website . But CYCA commodore Howard Piggott defended their decision, saying they had warned Wharington his paperwork did not prove the modifications met international standards. ""The race committee has no option but to not accept the entry of Wild Thing,"" Piggott told the official race website. ""This is the final decision of the race committee that puts safety first,"" he added. Last year's race was also hit by a controversy after Investec Loyal (now renamed Ragamuffin Loyal) pipped Wild Oats XI for line honors in a dramatic finish in Tasmania. The winner had to survive a protest from the race committee which alleged one of its crew members had gleaned information from a TV helicopter crew about the sails being deployed by Wild Oats. Without Wild Thing, the 76-strong fleet made the usual spectacular exit from Sydney Harbor with Wild Oats establishing an early advantage. But hopes of breaking its own race record of one day, 18 hours, 40 minutes and 10 seconds set in 2005 appeared to be fading with Ragamuffin Loyal, skippered by 85-year-old Syd Fischer, in hot pursuit. Behind the super maxis, the rest of the fleet is battling for handicap honors, which take into account each yacht's dimensions and sail area.","Five-time line honors winner Wild Oats XI leads Rolex Sydney-Hobart .

Lauda, a winner of 25 grands prix between 1974 and 1985, says Alonso's approach this season has been close to perfect, grinding out results in a car which was considered substandard at the start of the season. Alonso: ""Ferrari must improve"" ""He is making all the right moves,"" Lauda, who won the drivers' title twice with Ferrari, told the sport's official website. ""He is fast and he is getting the car over the finish line. He is aggressive when needed. He is Mr Right, right now. ""I say that he will carry on racing the way he has done so far and then the list of those who count themselves still in the running is dramatically reduced. ""He will score the most points. He will be champion if he carries on like he has done up until now."" Vettel triumphs in Singapore . When asked what Ferrari, the most successful team in F1 history, would be without the 31-year-old Alonso, Lauda responded: ""Not as good. It is always the combination of driver and team that makes success."" Rumors have suggested Ferrari may look to replace Alonso's teammate Felipe Massa for the 2013 season, with Sauber's Sergio Perez mooted as a potential successor to the Brazilian. But Austrian Lauda reckons it is too early in the Mexican's career for him to be a suitable fit at Ferrari. Latest Formula One standings . ""I don't see it,"" added Lauda. ""Perez would be a risk. Massa is predictable and Alonso likes him, so I say that such a switch is not going to happen."" Lauda also singled out former Ferrari driver Kimi Raikkonen for praise. The Lotus driver sits third in the championship despite only returning to the sport this season after two years away. Raikkonen was the last Ferrari driver to win the championship when he fended off competition from Alonso -- then racing for McLaren -- and Briton Lewis Hamilton, who is still driving for the British team, to clinch the 2007 crown. ""The fascinating thing with Kimi is that he came back and didn't need any warm-up time. It's as if he had never been away,"" said Lauda. ""Kimi came back as if he hadn't been away for two years. He was fighting immediately at the top. You cannot ask for more.""","Triple world champion Niki Lauda tips Fernando Alonso for 2012 title .

"(CNN) -- The Race to Dakar has been marred by injuries to three Britons after they were involved in a road traffic accident in South America, which left two others dead. The support vehicle, a Land Rover Defender, was involved in a head-on collision in the town of Tacna, Peru, close to the Chilean border. Two other vehicles were involved in the smash, in which two lost their lives and others were injured. The three Race2Recovery members were taken to hospital and later flown to hospital in Lima, where they are said to be ""stable and conscious"". The injuries have been described as ""non-life threatening"". The three men, who are part of a team of injured soldiers taking part in the challenge, were named as Justin Birchall, 40, a team driver and civilian volunteer, whose Wildcat vehicle retired earlier in the race, former Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineer and Gulf War and Falklands war veteran Lee Townsend, a team mechanic, and retired Army Major John Winskill, the team logistics expert. Team leader Captain Tony Harris said: ""Our hearts go out to the families and relatives of those who have died in this tragic accident and we offer them our condolences and sympathy. ""Our entire team has been struck by the friendliness and support we have received from the Peruvian people since arriving for the Dakar Rally. Triple amputee takes on world's most dangerous race . ""The team decided before we even started that we would continue our endeavour. This is obviously a huge shock but we know that we have the blessing of the injured. They want the team to finish,"" he said. The Race2Recovery team is hoping to become the first disability team to complete the challenge, which takes in around 9,000 kilometers of extreme mountain and desert terrain. The squad of 28 includes both British and U.S. service people who were wounded during combat and have missing limbs, spinal injuries and psychological injuries. The race is scheduled to finish in Santiago, Chile on January 20. Since the inaugural race in 1978, 25 competitors have lost their lives, while more than 50 have died overall. Only 74 of the original 182 participants made it to Dakar in the first year. Although the race used to be held in Europe with the climax in Senegal, Africa, it was moved to South America in 2009 following threats of terrorism.","Three Britons injured following a road traffic accident in Peru, which left two dead .

"(CNN) -- Ferrari team principal Stefano Domenicali has defended the Italian constructor's decision to retain the services of Brazilian driver Felipe Massa for the 2013 season. Massa's future was the subject of much speculation after he failed to score a point in the first three races of 2012 and went on to collect just 25 points prior to the sport's annual midseason break at the end of July. But Massa, who has been with Ferrari since 2006, recovered in the second half of the campaign to score 98 points and record two podium finishes, ending the year seventh in the drivers' championship. Domenicali is convinced Massa has turned the corner, showing the form he displayed before fracturing his skull when a spring struck his helmet at the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix. ""I think the toughest part of Felipe's career is now behind him,"" Domenicali told Ferrari's official website, when asked about the 31-year-old. ""After last summer his approach turned about and, as a result, his performance on track changed and he managed to show just how talented he is. ""I'm sure his problem was not linked to his contractual situation. Personally, there was a lot of pressure on me regarding possible changes, but in the interests of the team, I preferred to wait and today, I'm convinced that keeping Felipe in the Ferrari family was the right decision."" Massa signed a new one-year deal with the most successful team in F1 history in October, although he admits he did consider turning his back on the sport when he was struggling for pace. ""I thought about so many things,"" Massa, who lost out on the 2008 world championship on the final corner of the final race, told BBC Sport. ""I thought maybe I was finished. I thought about not staying in Ferrari. I did not know what would happen. So many things were inside my brain. ""Many people said I was just using fuel at the beginning of the year and then after they want me to stay in Ferrari because it was the best option. It is important to work to get the good result. If you have that nothing else is important."" Massa and teammate Fernando Alonso, who lost out on the 2012 drivers' title to Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel on the final day of the season, will be hoping to make a strong start to the 2013 campaign when the season begins in Australia in March.","Stefano Domenicali says Ferrari ""right"" to keep Felipe Massa as a driver .

"(CNN) -- Is the three-year-old eurozone sovereign debt crisis nearing its end? The very fact that such a question is being asked with increasing frequency by investment strategists speaks volumes about the dramatic improvement in market sentiment towards the eurozone of late. Psychologically speaking, the end of 2012 is a far cry from the dark days of November 2011 when nervousness about the eurozone was at its highest. What accounts for this shift in sentiment and is it justified? Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank (ECB), deserves most, if not all, of the credit. By promising in late July to ""do whatever it takes"" to save the eurozone, Draghi significantly reduced the threat of Europe's single currency area breaking up. Read more: Greece: When anger goes beyond despair . The results speak for themselves. Spain, the focal point for market anxiety for much of this year, is now seeing foreign capital trickle back into its economy after months of outflows. The yield on Spanish benchmark 10-year bonds, which many investors treat as a proxy for risk in the eurozone as a whole, now stands at just under 5.4%, sharply down from 7.6% as recently as July 24. As for Italy, whose bond market was collapsing late last year and which is gearing up for a crucial parliamentary election that could take place as early as March 10, investors have never been more sanguine about the country since it got sucked into the eurozone crisis in July 2011. Italy is now selling 10-year bonds at pre-crisis yield levels. Yet what if Draghi hadn't pledged to do what's necessary to prevent the eurozone from breaking apart? Would Spanish and, to lesser extent, Italian interest rates have fallen so sharply without the promise of bond-buying from the ECB? Definitely not. The recent improvement in sentiment towards the eurozone stems almost entirely from the actions of one man - Draghi. Read more: The eurozone's reluctant leader . I would not underestimate the determination of the ECB to shore up the debt markets of southern Europe. So successful has Draghi's bond-purchasing pledge been in driving down Spanish and Italian yields that some foreign investors now see Italian bonds as an attractive buying opportunity. Yet if the risks in the eurozone are receding, why are investors still parking most of their money in ""safe haven"" German bonds -- and even paying Berlin for the privilege of lending it money as the negative yields at recent auctions of short-term German bonds illustrate? The answer's clear: Investors rightly believe the eurozone crisis is still far from being resolved and could yet flare up again. Market commentators should stop focusing solely on government bond yields and start paying more attention to Europe's deteriorating economic fundamentals and its messy politics. There's a reason why Draghi had to step in to stem the panic: Because eurozone politicians keep dithering instead of putting in place measures to secure the financial and economic stability of Europe. In a nutshell, there's an enduring standoff between a French-led group of member states wary of ceding more sovereignty and a German-led one wary of sharing more risks. To make matters worse, Germany is even reluctant to share more sovereignty when it comes to allowing the ECB to start supervising its banks -- in particular its weaker regional lenders known as the Landesbanken - as the first stage in plans to set up a banking union across Europe. It's the politics of the eurozone crisis which matter most now. The big issues in Europe -- establishing a banking union, shoring up Spain, agreeing on a new seven-year European Union budget and, last but by no means least, keeping Greece in the eurozone -- are in the hands of politicians, and not of the ECB. So when you hear about how successful Spanish and Italian bond auctions have been of late, bear in mind that bond yields are just one gauge --- and by no means the most important -- of whether the eurozone crisis is nearing its end. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nicholas Spiro.","Improvement in sentiment is largely a result of actions taken by ECB head Mario Draghi .
Market commentators should pay more attention to fundamentals and less to fluctuating bond yields .
The end of 2012 is a far cry from the dark days of 2011 when nervousness about the eurozone was at its highest ."
"San Francisco (CNN) -- We have reached San Francisco, the end of our almost 4,000 km journey from Chicago. Here, I am meeting the former mayor Willie Brown. He ran the city for eight years from 1996 to 2004, and before that was the speaker of California's legislative assembly for 15 years. The weather here is spectacular. It is in the 20s, and unusual to have such glorious warm days so late in the year. It makes the Golden Gate Bridge glisten. San Francisco must surely be the most beautiful of cities. But the beauty should not mask the terrible financial mess the state faces. Gallery: Images from the journey . It would take a voting catastrophe for President Barack Obama to lose in California. The state hasn't voted for a Republican presidential candidate since 1988. But the president (and the country) must listen closely to the trends coming from here, because what starts in California often ends up spreading across the country. Also there are some crucial Congressional elections which, if they go badly, would make it much harder for the Democrats to regain control of the House. In California they are worried about the economy and jobs. The unemployment rate, at 10.2%, is the third highest in the country. Immigration and health are also big concerns. But here, they are used to a higher standard of living and superb college system: One which is now crumbling. There is a state budget deficit which would make even the eurozone blush. In May the Governor of California, Jerry Brown, announced the deficit was $16 billion. With the potential to balloon even higher unless something is done. Read more: Romney's university worlds apart . With these facts, today's California is starting to look a lot like austerity Europe. Think about it. Over the past few years, California has made deep cuts in education, social services, and even releasing some prisoners early to save money. It has proposed raising income and sales taxes to close this stubborn budget gap, that is dangerously large and won't go away while the economy languishes. There are more similarities. In the past, when California fell on hard times, it could rely on a rising national economy to pick up the slack. After all, the U.S. economy is one large locomotive, and when one state falls on hard times the others can lend a hand. That can't happen this time, because nationally there is no extra economic oomph to pick up the slack. It is exactly the same as the eurozone, where even the German growth engine can't pull everyone out of recession. As the International Monetary Fund noted in the latest World Economic Outlook, everyone is cutting deficits at the same time and this makes a bad situation worse. California is as much a victim of this as any European country. Colorado: Will frontier state call election? I don't want to push this analogy too far. California's economy is in better fundamental shape than many eurozone countries. What I am suggesting is that the European austerity, which so far has not hit most of America, has well and truly arrived. This trend setting state is one of the first to truly feel the longer-lasting effects which I have no doubt will spread -- whoever wins the election. Austerity California is a glimpse of the future for America; the rest of the country, blinded by extravagant election promises, just doesn't yet realize it.","CNN's Richard Quest has arrived in San Francisco, where he will meet former mayor Willie Brown .

"(CNN) -- The Dakar Rally is arguably the world's most dangerous motorsport race, but for one newcomer it cannot compare with what he has already been through. British soldier Tom Neathway will be co-driving in the 16-day event, which traverses the mountainous desert terrain of South America, despite losing both his legs and an arm after standing on a booby trap while serving in Afghanistan in 2008. He effectively died three times, and had to be resuscitated on each occasion on the operating table back at base. ""I think the Dakar's less dangerous than what I've done, and I think I knew what I was getting myself into when I signed up for it,"" Neathway told CNN. ""Saying that, most of the guys I've spoken to about the Dakar never do it again, so it's clearly not easy."" Founder Thierry Sabine described the grueling endurance event as ""a challenge for those who go, a dream for those who stay behind."" A total of 25 competitors have lost their lives since the inaugural race started in Paris in late 1978, and more than 50 people overall including spectators. Only 74 of the 182 entrants for that first staging made it as far as the Senegalese capital Dakar. Sabine himself died during the 1986 race when the helicopter in which he was traveling was struck by a sudden sandstorm. Traditionally, the race wound its way from Europe down to the south-west of Africa, but was relocated to South America in 2009 because of terrorist threats. This year's 33rd staging will start on January 5 in Lima, Peru, and finish in the Chilean capital of Santiago. Neathway is well aware of the rigors of rallying -- he has only just recovered from a broken arm after crashing badly at one of his warmup events -- but it pales into insignificance compared to what he experienced on July 22, 2008. ""We were on a routine patrol when we came under enemy fire,"" recalls Neathway, who is one of five injured military personnel taking part in the 2013 race. ""I was part of the sniper team and moved into position to provide covering fire for my fellow troops. ""The area I went to was already cleared by metal detectors where there was a sandbag. I asked for it to be checked again and it was. Then I lifted the sandbag and the blast took off my feet and badly damaged my left arm. ""At the time, the first thing I checked was my cock and balls. Once I saw my feet weren't there, I was more focused on just stopping the bleeding than worrying about not walking again. I remember joking around -- as I'm into my cars -- that I wouldn't be driving my Subaru anytime soon. ""It's odd to think there's that sort of banter just after getting blown up. There wasn't any panic, it was all very straightforward. ""I remember I was conscious throughout the whole thing. I was surprisingly okay and chatting to the medic throughout. It was then that I felt I'd be okay despite quite heavy blood loss. I'd been blown up a couple of times before but obviously this one was a lot more serious."" Having been restored to full health, Neathway will compete for the Race2Recovery team, with funds raised going towards injured servicemen and women. He will be the navigator for able-bodied driver Justin Birchall for the 8,000-kilometer event. The challenging route has desert stages virtually from the outset, then goes through gaucho territory in Argentina after crossing the Andes before the challenge of the Chilean dunes. Despite the dangers of the race, for some its lure is just too much. Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's son Mark was a notable entry in 1982, when he went missing for six days along with his co-driver and mechanic. After being spotted by a Algerian air force plane, Thatcher downplayed the severity of the incident, insisting that all he needed was ""a sandwich, a bath and a shave."" Prince Albert of Monaco was another high-profile entry three years later along with five-time Tour de France cycle race winner Jacques Anquetil in 1986 and French rock singer Johnny Hallyday in 2002. Former France international rugby player Christian Califano competed in the motorbike category from 2009-11. ""I didn't worry about accidents. I didn't think about that at all. I didn't really worry about the dangers until the end as there's no point worrying about these things as that's when things go wrong,"" he said. ""For me, the Dakar was always a dream. When I played rugby, I used to say, 'Guys, one day I will do the Dakar and they'd be like 'Shut up Christian, don't be crazy, you'll never do it, you're a liar.' ""When they heard I'd entered they again said I was crazy but I didn't feel crazy. I just loved the whole experience. I was like nothing else."" This year's entry list features almost 200 competitors in the motorbike class, 115 in the cars, 40 in the quad bikes and 176 in the trucks. The amateur element accounts for about 80% of the entrants -- including Tarek El Erian, who planned to be on his honeymoon during the race but put his wedding plans on hold after receiving a late wildcard entry. ""I'm grateful towards my wife-to-be because this is unthinkable in Egypt, but we postponed the marriage so that I could take part in the rally,"" he explained. It is not just an event for the competitors -- the 2013 version will be televised in 189 countries, with an audience of 2.2 billion from start to finish. But it will once again attract criticism, as has been customary since Sabine first came up with the idea after getting lost on his motorbike in 1977 in Libyan desert during another event, the Abidjan-Nice Rally. France's Green Party once described it as ""colonialism that needs to be eradicated"" while the Vatican once called it ""a vulgar display of power and wealth in places where men continue to die from hunger and thirst."" The race's history is entwined with tragedy. The helicopter crash which accounted for Sabine's death also led to the death of four others on board. Just two years later, six people lost their lives, including a 10-year-old Malian girl struck by a competitor's car, and a mother and daughter killed when hit by a television crew's vehicle. But for those who take part, the risks are part of the excitement. Michel Merel, runner-up in the motorbike class in 1980, said fear was the biggest lure of the Dakar. ""The piste is like the ocean,"" he said. ""It is wrong not to fear it. As for me, the piste makes me scared -- you don't mess around with it. You can't be an artist."" The race's most successful entrant is Stephane Peterhansel, a six-time winner of the motorcycle category who also has four car titles, including last year. The Frenchman, 47, describes his Dakar years as ""the most memorable of my life,"" reveling in the ""complete emptiness, nothingness"" of the desert tundra at night. While Peterhansel will once again hope to make the headlines, Neathway is likely to be one of the unsung battlers just trying to make it home. ""I've always been a petrolhead and did motocross as a kid,"" he says. ""Since recovering from my injuries, the Dakar has been the dream. ""Most people don't get to do that but I've got the chance. For me, the main thing is just to finish.""","Dakar Rally begins in Peruvian capital on January 5 and finishes 15 days later in Chile .

"Camp Verde, Arizona (CNN) -- A participant in a 2009 Arizona sweat lodge ceremony that left three people dead testified Thursday that he asked a volunteer if he had died and was told, ""No, you came back."" Dennis Mehravar, a real estate salesman from Canada, testified that self-help author and speaker James Ray, who led the event, told him he had been reborn. Ray is accused of three counts of manslaughter in the deaths of three people who were in the sweat lodge for the purification ceremony. If convicted, he could face up to 10 years in prison on each count. Mehravar, asked if he would have assisted someone next to him who was dying, said he would normally have done so, but the conditions in the lodge made that difficult. ""I wasn't 100% aware, alert of what was going on around me."" Responding to a follow-up question, Mehravar said he would have waited until a round was over to ask for help. The sweat lodge ceremony consisted of eight rounds, with each round lasting 10 to 15 minutes. While they were not prevented from leaving, participants have said they were encouraged to wait until the breaks between rounds. Mehravar said he would not have tried to stop the ceremony: ""I don't think I would. I know it doesn't sound logical."" ""I think Mr. Ray would have got upset if I had interrupted the ceremony,"" he said. Prosecutors maintain Ray psychologically pressured participants to remain in the lodge even when they weren't feeling well, contributing to the deaths of the three victims. The defense has argued the incident was ""a tragic accident"" and that participants had a free choice to take part the activities or leave if they became too intense. On cross-examination, defense attorney Luis Li displayed for the jury Mehravar's medical record from his hospital visit following the sweat lodge ceremony. Li pointed out that doctors could not find a cause for his symptoms and noted the same finding in the two victims that died that day. The defense has asserted that the symptoms exhibited by the victims are consistent with poisoning from an unknown toxin. Mehravar, who said he trusted Ray, testified he screamed before losing consciousness during the ceremony at a resort in Sedona. Another ceremony participant, Michael Olesen, a businessman from Ontario, told the jury how he helped drag people out of the lodge and render assistance. When he asked about one woman, Ray told him she would be all right, Olesen testified. Mehravar and Olesen both acknowledged they did not read the waivers carefully before signing them. The waiver advised participants to consult a physician before participating in events at the spiritual retreat. Olesen said he did not tell Ray when he returned to the lodge after a break that there were people outside getting assistance. But, he said, his attendance at prior Ray seminars indicated the author didn't like people interrupting a session. Jurors on Wednesday heard a recording in which Ray previewed the intense ceremony and told participants how it would be a ""death and rebirth experience."" He told participants it would include the most ""intense heat you've every experienced in your life. You will feel like you are going to die."" The author described the October 2009 ceremony as a sacred way for participants to rid themselves of ""all the things that you've allowed to be your truth and have caused you to sell yourself short."" In the recording, Ray told participants, who paid up to $10,000 each to attend the event, that as ""true spiritual warriors"" and in their ""altered state"" they would endure heat so intense it would make it feel like their skins was coming off of their bodies. ""I will be right there with you,"" he said. ""You will have to get to a point where you surrender to death,"" Ray said. ""When you are going into the lodge symbolically you are going back into the womb of Mother Earth."" ""It is such a great metaphor,"" the author said. ""... My body dies but I never die."" Prosecutors argue that the lodge -- made of willow trees and branches, and covered with tarpaulins and blankets -- was heated to perilously high temperatures, causing the participants to suffer dehydration and heatstroke. During his recorded talk, Ray repeatedly told participants to drink plenty of fluids. Kirby Brown, 38, of Westtown, New York, and James Shore, 40, of Milwaukee, died the night of the event. Volunteer Lizbeth Marie Neuman, 49, of Prior Lake, Minnesota, died nine days after the ceremony. At least 15 others who took part in the ritual fell ill, but more than 40 others were uninjured.

"London (CNN) -- The European Commission's president Jose Manuel Barroso says a federation of Europe is ""unavoidable"" if Europe's embattled common currency is to survive the financial crisis. Barroso's comments to CNN followed Wednesday's annual ""State of the Union"" address, which he delivered in Strasbourg, France, making the case for a unified Europe to stem the euro-area's debt crisis. In reference to the euro, shared by 17-member states, Barroso told CNN: ""A single currency depends on the solidity, on the credibility of the institutions and the political construct behind it. So, I believe [a federation] is going to happen. ""We are saying that in some areas, like the common currency, like the supervision of the banks, like the common supervision of the budgets, we need this sharing of sovereignty,"" he added. European institutions are already moving toward a more unified Europe in attempts to drag the euro bloc out of its financial mire. The European Central Bank -- led by president Mario Draghi -- is undertaking a bond-buying program for fiscally-frail nations in an effort to reduce borrowing costs for the likes of Italy and Spain. More: Crisis in-depth . On Wednesday, the European Commission -- the executive branch of the EU -- presented plans to extend the bank's powers further. Barroso wants to give the European Central Bank a regulatory role for over 6,000 banks operating in the eurozone. This raised concerns, particularly by Germany, over sovereignty and banking supervision. But Barroso told CNN: ""citizens of Europe are now paying very, very heavy bills because precisely we don't have that, because the banks are transnational, but the supervision until now is purely national."" His comments follow this week's decision by Germany's Constitutional Court to green light the European Stability Mechanism -- the euro area's permanent bailout fund for debt-ridden nations -- that will come into force in October. According to Barroso, ""the European Stability Mechanism has a capital that is comparable to the International Monetary Fund, so it's the European IMF we have now."" ""It's quite obvious that to sustain a common currency, we need more common power,"" he added. Barroso's call for a federal Europe is the latest in a long line of measures taken by European politicians to forge closer financial ties. Moves include March's deal for a ""fiscal pact"" which will come into force January 2013, should it be ratified by 12 of the 17 euro countries. But Barroso said such measures would not threaten the sovereignty of participating countries: ""It's a shared sovereignty,"" he said. ""It's not a transfer of powers from the capitals."" Barroso said he had ""no doubts"" about the determination of Greece -- at the center of the eurozone debt crisis -- to implement reform and retain its place in the common currency. According to Barroso, integration is the only way to compete on the global stage. ""Even the biggest countries in Europe alone, if they are on their own, they will not have the leverage to deal with these issues globally, with our American friends or with the giants of power, like China and others that are emerging,"" he said.","European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso says a federal Europe is ""unavoidable""

"(CNN) -- The Federal Reserve ""printing money"" will never solve the economic problems in the U.S., Chilean President Sebastian Pinera has told CNN. Pinera's comments follow the Fed's September announcement it will launch its third round of quantitative easing to combat the country's stagnating economic growth and unemployment rate of 8.1%. Pinera said the U.S. policy of monetary stimulus is a ""concern"" for Chile and other countries in South America such as Brazil. He added: ""You need to take account of the fiscal deficit... People want miracles. But in economics, you don't have miracles. You just have good policy and hard work."" Pinera also warned Europe ""to make up their minds"" on the debt crisis. Countries in the 17-nation currency bloc are grappling with soaring budget deficits and high government borrowing costs. Spain: Gliding toward bailout? He said: ""Countries like Spain, Italy and Greece, they will have to tighten their belts. But other countries like Germany will have to help them in that process. And that is not happening yet."" Chile is considered one of the most stable and secure countries in South America, according to reports by the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development and the World Bank. Barroso: Europe federation 'unavoidable' The country -- a long strip that spans the western coast of South America -- is rich in mineral resources, particularly copper. In addition to low fiscal debt and political stability, the country's exports grew 17% in 2011 compared with a year earlier. Pinera attributes Chile's integration into global markets to free-trade agreements with China, the U.S. and Europe and the government's mission to transform the country into a developed nation before 2020. He said: ""Here in Chile you have got a very pro-business environment."" The country, he added, ""is growing at more than 6% a year. That is creating jobs like never before, and at the same time reducing poverty and inequality."" Despite a dip in approval ratings, Pinera is positive on the future and says that now the Chileans are beginning to see the benefits of their labors. ""I think that the best is yet to come. We have invested so much that I hope that the next two years will be a time for harvest... And I hope that people are realizing that a country like Chile is able to achieve goals that were perceived as impossible only a few years ago.""

"(CNN) -- Saturday's World Cup downhill race in Bormio ended in a thrilling dead heat as Aksel Lund Svindal extended his overall lead despite narrowly missing out on a three-way share of victory. The Norwegian had to settle for third place after finishing just 0.01 seconds behind Austria's Hannes Reichelt and Italy's Dominik Paris -- who delighted the home crowd by claiming his first World Cup win. ""It's amazing, it was my dream to win a downhill in the World Cup -- and now I finally won it,"" said the 23-year-old, who finished third at his national championships in March. ""Tying with Reichelt doesn't make any difference -- I am only happy to be on top. I was very nervous in the leader box because I knew the others behind will ski well, but it turned out good. ""It is totally amazing to win here in Bormio, I can't say anything just that it was a dream come true."" Reichelt also set a time of one minute 58.62 seconds as he claimed the fifth World Cup win of his career and his second podium this season after placing third in the Super G at Beaver Creek in the U.S. at the start of December. ""I feel like I am back in downhill because my last races were really bad, but I felt confident today,"" the 32-year-old said. ""I think equipment today was very important because if the skies are stable on this bumpy slope it helps you to ski fast. During the Christmas break we did a good job, I did a lot of testing and now I can say I am on the right wave back. The year is ending really, really nice."" Svindal earned his first podium finish at Bormio, which is considered one of the most testing courses on the World Cup circuit. He finished 0.01 seconds ahead of fourth-placed Austrian Klaus Kroll, who was the World Cup downhill champion last season. ""It's crazy, four guys within two-hundredths on one of the toughest downhills in the world,"" said Svindal, who leads the downhill standings by 92 points from Paris and has a 114-point advantage in the overall competition. He now has a record-equaling six podium positions before New Year, matching the mark set by Austria's Michael Walchhofer in 2004-05. ""I can't remember a race exactly this close. But as a ski racer you almost get used to it, it's actually kind of crazy like that,"" Svindal said. ""For sure there is that one mistake at the bottom that I wish I had back, but that's ski racing. As long as you are fighting for the win like I am today, sometimes you get it and sometimes you don't. But racing is a lot of fun when you are in that position."" Meanwhile, Veronika Zuzulova had a comparatively more comfortable victory in the women's slalom in Semmering, Austria, as she won her first World Cup race. The Slovakian was 0.10 seconds ahead of home hope Kathrin Zettel over the two runs, while Tina Maze extended her overall World Cup lead with her 11th podium in 16 starts. The Slovenian, who was fastest in the first run, now has a 427-point advantage over Germany's Maria Hofl-Riesch, who placed fourth.","Hannes Reichelt and Dominik Paris share first place in men's World Cup downhill race .

"London (CNN) -- The power of fuel will be overtaken by electric energy in a new global auto race being used to showcase eco-friendly cars. The Formula E series, set to launch in 2014, is aiming to rival Formula 1 -- but with electric cars. Formula E chief executive Alejandro Agag believes the future of the automotive industry, particularly in cities, is electric. He hopes the auto race will help promote the wider use of electric cars. Agag wants the Formula E series to take place in ""the heart"" of the world's leading towns. It will be showcased in ""cities committed to clean mobility and sustainability,"" Agag told CNN's Quest Means Business. ""We think we can be of help to those cities that are promoting the use of the electric car, by making it more popular."" Formula One strives for a green future . Staging the races in city centers rather than on traditional race tracks will highlight the practicality of using battery-powered vehicles in urban areas. Formula E representatives are in talks with major cities around the world about the contest, with a particular focus on emerging economies and Asia. ""We believe that cities are the natural environment for electric cars,"" added Agag. ""The extended use of the electric vehicle will play a very important part in reducing city air pollution."" Brazil's Rio de Janeiro has already signaled its willingness to host an Electric Grand Prix in 2014. Over the next four years the Brazilian city will be a global hub of sport as it hosts the soccer World Cup in two years and the Olympic Games in 2016. ""Rio is a city with a special commitment to sustainability, as the recent global environment summit has shown,"" added Agag, referring to Rio+20. ""We will be proud to race there from 2014 onwards."" Singapore: The future of F1 finance? He noted: ""In Mexico we are coordinating with key figures including Carlos Slim (Telmex's CEO and the richest person in the world) and Federico Alaman (Mexico City promoter), to identify the best locations in the country."" The Formula E cars will be capable of speeds over 200 kilometers an hour, and rather than substituting tire at a pit stop, the driver will change cars instead. The plan for Formula E's inaugural season is to have 10 teams and 20 drivers, with the possibility of adding more teams in future. The auto championship will work in partnership with the FÃ©dÃ©ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) -- motorsport's governing body -- for the promotion of clean mobility and sustainability. Agag wants to use racing to promote research into electric vehicles with a focus on younger generations, in an effort to push the message of sustainable energy. He added: ""To make people believe that they need an electric car and a more sustainable lifestyle... We want to show everyone what these cars can do.""

"(CNN) -- Jesse Owens' triumph over the Third Reich in Berlin at the 1936 Olympic Games, Zinedine Zidane's perfect volley in the 2002 European Champions League final, Tiger Woods' astonishing chip-in at the Masters in 2005 or Rafael Nadal celebrating in the growing dusk around Wimbledon's Centre Court after overcoming Roger Federer in 2008. All iconic moments in the history of sport, forever etched in the memory of spectators lucky enough to be able to say ""I was there"". But these days witnessing greatness is clearly not quite enough for the modern sports fan as countless spectators religiously record career-defining events on mobile devices and post their own personal accounts on various social media websites. Shades of greatness: Duval dreams of British Open renaissance . ""The pleasure of sport lies not so much in witnessing an event as talking about it,"" explains Ellis Cashmore, professor of Culture, Media and Sport at England's Staffordshire University. ""We've all at some point sat at home and watched a fight or a tennis match in isolation and it's never as enjoyable as when we are in company, talking about the competition as it unfolds. Mobile phones have opened out the possibilities. We can talk to anyone, anywhere while the action is taking place."" One event to have resisted the tidal wave of mobile technology which has swept through society is the British Open -- golf's oldest major -- which will take place for the 141st time this weekend. Blog: Why U.S. golf has a healthy future . But this year the R & A, which governs golf outside the United States and Mexico, has relented, allowing spectators at north-west England's Royal Lytham and St. Annes Golf Club to bring their phones into the event for the first time since 2006. ""The attachment people have to their mobile phones is getting ever stronger,"" R & A head of communications Malcolm Booth told CNN. ""People feel it's an item they really don't want to be separated from. It's very clear to us that people coming to any sporting event, and the Open is no exception, want to have their mobile phones with them."" This is a view supported by Cashmore as he outlines how people are increasingly unwilling to venture out of the house without a mobile phone in their pocket. ""Mobiles are now less accessories, more extensions of our lives,"" said Cashmore, who is currently conducting a study entitled ""Barbaric Britain?"" ""We can manage without our watches or our keys, but not our phones. They are like pacemakers -- artificial devices, but vital for the regulation of organs. ""More generally we are consuming sports differently today than we were as recently as five years ago. The pattern is towards a much more remote consumption through smartphones and mobile computers. ""Portability is the key to this. We consume not just sport but everything on the move."" Current world No. 3 Lee Westwood, searching for a first major title in front of his home fans, sees no reason why the public should be separated from their trusty mobile phones, providing the players are not distracted at crucial moments. Australian Adam Scott, also looking for a first win in one of golf's four marquee events, agrees with Westwood, though as long as the sport's fans observe the customary on-course etiquette. The R & A have set up designated ""Mobile Device Zones"" where visitors can use their phones, while also attempting to ensure spectators do not take home their every own visual souvenirs. ""There are obviously great challenges with that,"" outlined Booth. ""That provision is in keeping with many sporting events, including the Olympics where they are going to have exactly the same challenge. ""We have a very strict mobile phone policy at the Open Championship this year which means there are dedicated areas where people can use their phones. ""The hope is they will not use phones to any great extent near play and we'll have a marshal near play encouraging that behavior. It is one of the great challenges of allowing mobile phones at any sporting event."" Cashmore argues such personal recordings of events are used by people to enhance their eye-witness memories. ""We remember experiences by context: the circumstances that form the setting for an event, what happened immediately before and afterwards, and the people with whom we stood, sat and chatted to,"" said Cashmore. ""Phones enable us to extend this to a wider network of people. By describing an experience we memorialize it."" One man who believes sport's iconic moments do not require additional ""memorializing"" is British journalist Richard Williams, the author of Perfect 10: Football's dreamer, schemers playmakers and playboys. Ten years ago Williams was at Hampden Park, Glasgow when Zidane's audacious left-foot strike in the last minute of the first half proved enough to give Real Madrid a 2-1 win over Germany's Bayer Leverkusen in one of soccer's most high-profile matches -- the European Champions League final. Williams believes he witnessed a sporting moment of such complete perfection he decided to never watch a replay of the now iconic goal. ""Maybe people growing up now, in the age of technology and media saturation, will develop a different attitude,"" wrote Williams in a chapter extolling the talents of Zidane. ""But one of the pleasures of being a football fan is the archive of individual images saved on the memory's hard drive. ""Each of them is divorced from its immediate context: only with the greatest difficulty could I dredge up the details of the matches in question, never mind its result. ""I wanted Zidane's goal to claim a place in that personal file ... If I watched it again on television, I would inevitably be replacing my own image of the moment with that of a television camera, if only partially. ""It would not contain within it the surge of exhilaration and admiration that I felt in that moment and that remain part of the emotional response to replaying the goal as it was experienced from my own point of view."" Despite the compelling and heartfelt argument put forward by Williams, Booth is confident the British Open will retain the aura which has helped it become one of golf's most cherished tournaments. ""You can't swim against the tide in terms of technology and we're not the only sporting event having to deal with this challenge,"" said Booth. ""We've got great television partners and they are always going to find a way to romanticize those phenomenal sporting moments. Equally, people will want to take their own records of sporting events. ""There would be no point trying to fight that, it is the way people want to consume events now. But traditional media will always allow you to present events in the way they should be."" So with the influence of the phone continuing to grow, how long before spectators are so busy tweeting about the British Open they miss the champion lifting the Claret Jug?","The British Open will allow mobile phones for the first time since 2006 .

"(CNN) -- AS Monaco have promoted their Norwegian technical director to chief executive as the Ligue 2 team announced a management restructure as part of their strategy to return the French club to former glories. After buying a majority stake in the seven-time French champions in December 2011, billionaire Russian businessman Dmitry Rybolovlev has handed Tor-Kristian Karlsen, who before joining Monaco as technical director in March 2012 worked as a scout for Zenit St Petersburg, the dual role of CEO and director general. The club won the last of their French league titles in 2000 and were Champions League runners-up in 2004, before they relegated to Ligue 2 in 2011. However, Rybolovlev, who according to Forbes has a net worth of $9 billion and is the 13th richest man in Russian, has ambitious plans to revive Monaco. In the summer Monaco appointed experienced Italian manager Claudio Ranieri as their new coach and signing promising Argentine youngster Lucas Ocampos for a reported $19m from River Plate. As well as establishing a reputation as a scout who was capable of identifying emerging global talent, Karlsen was briefly Norwegian club Frekrikstad's sporting director between September 2008 and January 2009. ""The management can now focus all its efforts on achieving sporting performance,"" Rybolovlev told the Monaco website. ""I am delighted to welcome Tor-Kristian Karlsen to his new position of Director General and CEO -- he has exactly the right qualities and experience to drive the future performance of ASM."" As part of the restructure, Dmitry Chechkin is to step down as vice-president, with that role to remain vacant. Monaco are currently second in Ligue 2, a point behind Dijon.","French club Monaco promote Norwegian technical director Tor-Kristian Karlsen .

"Athens (CNN) -- Wandering through central Athens' Syntagma Square, Maria Papanagiotaki and Aristotle Skalizos stop to perch on a sun-soaked bench as they consider their future. The couple, who have been dating for two-and-a-half years, belong to Greece's post-junta generation, growing up as the country emerged into its modern democracy. As Greece's turbulent history faded into its past, the country's political landscape remained fraught with nepotism and mismanagement. Read more: Is Greek democracy regressing? But the boom times had begun. Greece entered the euro in 2001, and ex-pat money flooded back into the country. It hosted the Olympic Games in 2004, swelling the country with pride. But by 2009 -- when the country admitted its deficit was out of control -- the financial mirage evaporated. Maria, 34, and 25-year old Aristotle's generation was caught in the fallout. The couple belong to a young professional class that will help shape their country's future. Together, they must decide if they are willing to live through -- and help alleviate -- Greece's pain. Their views differ dramatically, and it weighs on their relationship. A few meters away from where Maria, an electronic mobile technician, and Aristotle, an electronics tester, chat, a man stumbles to his knees, dropping a begging cup. Grasping for it as it rolls away, he ends up splayed on the ground. It's a disturbing sight, but one which has become increasingly common in Athens since austerity measures began to bite. Greece's poverty, suicide and crime rates have increased alongside unemployment and emigration. It is this environment Maria wants to leave. She dreams of life outside of Greece, in the UK or the U.S., where she has relatives. ""I have to go,"" she says. ""I have to leave from here."" Aristotle wants to remain. ""I want to stay and fight,"" he says. ""I don't want to abandon my country."" His reasoning is clear: ""I love my country."" Maria and Aristotle . Maria and Aristotle began dating after meeting at their workplace, a Germany-based telecommunications company. The relationship blossomed after, in Maria's words, ""he saw me there, we became friends, he was trying to approach me in any [way]... and finally after eight months we were together."" They moved in together, but say their financial situation has become increasingly difficult as the crisis has unfolded. Each has taken a significant cut in pay since April, in part because both have seen their work week reduced to four days a week. They now earn €1,160 ($1,415) a month between them, down from €1,480 ($1,805) two years ago. They pay €300 ($366) in rent and around €65 ($79) a week in groceries, but face extra costs because of the crisis. Since Aristotle's father's sculpture business went bankrupt in the recession, the young couple must also help his parents get by, he says. Neither voted in the June 17 elections, because they could not spare the cash to return to their home villages -- €15 ($18) for Maria, and €40 ($48) for Aristotle -- to vote. Pro-austerity package party New Democracy won the election, despite soaring support for the radical left Syriza party. Alexis Tsipras, who heads Syriza, is, like Maria, is in his 30s. Tsipras's vociferous rejection of Europe's austerity-driven demands for Greece appealed to discontented youth, with the party capturing 33% of 18 to 34-year-olds, compared to 20% for New Democracy. The surge is all the more dramatic given that Greeks, born in a country where family loyalty is embedded deep in the national psyche, usually vote the way of their forebears. Maria, for one, would have fallen behind her parents and voted New Democracy. The party now leads a fragile coalition, but that provides no comfort for Maria. A country fights for its future . Greece's new government is now renegotiating its bailout package, but there is no guarantee the country will emerge from years of recession. And the country could lose people like Maria and Aristotle overseas, while those with less hope could give in to despair. More than 50% of working age Greeks under 26 are without a job. Those just entering the workforce are particularly hard-hit, with 2011 figures from Eurostat showing 56% unemployment among those aged 15 to 19. Around one in four workers under 39 years old are unemployed. Eurostat figures show the extent of the exodus of young workers fleeing Greece's crisis. In 2010, almost 2.5% of those in their mid-to-late 20s left the country, while around 2% of those aged 30 to 34 emigrated. Dreams of going abroad . Those choosing to leave must struggle against the desire to stay and help their family, and overcome a deep loyalty to a country which has suffered under civil war, dictatorship, and foreign rule under Germany, now its main paymaster. Those entering the workforce carry a cultural weight of responsibility to family. Aristotle's 19-year-old brother, Nick, a student, wants to move to the Netherlands to study fine arts. Holland attracts him because of its place in art history, and the ""country and the color of the sky are beautiful,"" he says. But any money he earns -- after he's made enough to get by -- will be sent back to Greece, to help his family. Marios-Aristotle Koulouris, a 23-year-old soldier, also wants to go abroad, and study political science. But he wants to return, to break his generation's ""consciousness of dependency."" Greece, he believes, needs to ""rise up and develop its own power, to protect our people's benefits. Economically and politically, we need to rise up."" The country's next generation needs to be taught the value of productivity, he believes. The crisis represents a chance ""to change people's minds.... to abolish the mentality of dependency."" Coming back home . Some of those who have left Greece have already returned in an effort to help the country they love. Christina Psarra, a 27-year-old who works in policy at humanitarian organization Doctors of the World studied at the London School of Economics, while George Stathopoulos, a 33-year-old investment banker studied at Middlesex University. Although their educations opened a world of possibility, both opted to forgo careers abroad to return to Athens. Christina says when her studies in London were coming to an end last year, she knew it was time to ""feed my heart not my mind."" Christina and George describe Greece as a country where one always cooks extra food in preparation for a guest, where a feisty debate over sport will end with friendly drink, and where parents maintain close contact with children after they leave home. But this often idyllic country today finds itself immersed in anger and fear. And Christina, who is passionate about helping the vulnerable and now works with drug addicts, says she doesn't know which is more dangerous. ""I'm afraid for other people and myself,"" she says. With the option to work overseas, she believes she may be forced to leave, due to Greece's lack of opportunities. ""I have the chance, I have the choice to decide to live abroad. If I am forced to do it, I can do it,"" she says. George believes the country can -- should it follow the example of others, such as Turkey -- restructure itself into a viable European economy. The revelations of its financial irresponsibility, which led the spiral into bailout, were akin to the country being caught ""skinny-dipping"" when the tide went out, he says. George wants to see the country's red-tape unraveled to allow investment into its promising industries such as tourism and shipping. The problems for Greece are structural, he says, and that can be a ""glass half full ...you can see that as an opportunity. [If] you realize you have a problem, you can transform how you do business."" The way he sees it: ""The game is not lost but we are two goals behind."" Marios-Aristotle also sees opportunity in Greece's future, and he is not afraid of the pain that may still come. ""My country [during] its history has passed many greater disasters. So I am not afraid."" For Aristotle, there is one answer to a difficult question. It goes against his wishes but he will put his relationship with Maria ahead of his country. ""I love [Maria], and I will follow her. I will sacrifice,"" he says.","Maria Papanagiotaki and Aristotle Skalizos are in love, but they disagree over whether to stay in Greece or leave .
The couple belong to a generation devastated by the country's economic crisis .

"(CNN) -- FIFA president Sepp Blatter told CNN Wednesday that on-field racism was not a problem in football, remarks which caused a stir on the social-networking site Twitter. Blatter told CNN World Sport anchor Pedro Pinto that players who have been abused should shake hands with their opponent upon the final whistle and move on. Later he used his official @SeppBlatter account to reaffirm the commitment global football's governing body has to stamping out racism and discrimination within soccer. ""Racism and discrimination of any kind have no place in football. I have said this many times before, and I will say it again and again,"" tweeted the 75-year-old. ""However -- and it is not an excuse -- sometimes, in the heat of the moment, things are said and done on the field of play which are wrong."" FIFA chief Blatter: 'No on-field racism' But Blatter also stated that he does not believe player-to-player racial abuse is prevalent in football, saying the game is often a unifying force. ""This does not mean that, in general, there is racism on the field of play. Football unites people more than it divides them."" Chelsea and England captain John Terry is currently the subject of an investigation by London's Metropolitan Police into alleged racial abuse of Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand.

""Tell me I have just read Sepp Blatter's comments on racism in football wrong....if not then I am astonished,"" said Ferdinand. ""I feel stupid for thinking that football was taking a leading role against racism.....it seems it was just on mute for a while."" Ferdinand then addressed a question directly to Blatter, saying: ""@SeppBlatter your comments on racism are so condescending its almost laughable. If fans shout racist chants but shake our hands is that ok?"" Piers Morgan, host of CNN's Piers Morgan Tonight, condemned Blatter's remarks as ""utterly outrageous"". He wrote: ""Sepp Blatter just gave every racist in football a license to abuse. Even by his standards this is utterly outrageous."" Suarez charged by FA over Evra comments . The 'Kick It Out' group, who campaign to banish racism from football in England and Europe said in a statement: ""These comments are worryingly out of touch. ""Shaking hands to compensate for a racial slur is not what the game has signed up to, and trivializes the work of campaigns like Kick It Out, which has been in the vanguard of rooting out discrimination and unacceptable behavior in our game for the best part of two decades."" Former England and Liverpool striker Stan Collymore called on Blatter to end his 13-year reign at the top of global football. ""Mr Blatter, your comments about racism are ill-thought and condescending in the extreme. You should resign,"" Collymore tweeted. Jermaine Jenas is an England international currently on-loan at Aston Villa from Tottenham Hotspur. The midfielder called Blatter's comments ""ridiculous"". ""How can the head of the footballing world be so ignorant towards racism! Sepp Blatter's quotes are ridiculous. #educateyourself."" Sports Illustrated senior writer Grant Wahl was baffled by Blatter's remarks, echoing the calls for the FIFA chief to step down. ""Sepp Blatter tells @Pedrocnn any racist abuse between players should be settled with a handshake,"" said Wahl. ""Mind-boggling.

"(CNN) -- A preteen arrested and accused of protesting in Bahrain will not get jail time, authorities said Thursday. The verdict ends the case that had elicited criticism from activists angered that authorities would target an 11-year-old boy. Police arrested Ali Hasan on May 14 and accused him of participating in an ""illegal gathering"" with about a dozen others, according to the Persian Gulf kingdom's information office. On Thursday, a judge said the 11-year-old was free to go home with his family and would not face detention, according to Luma Bashmi, spokeswoman for the president's office. The boy will be under observation for the next year and be visited by a social worker every six months, Bashmi said. Hasan's arrest was part of a government clampdown on protesters in Bahrain. Rights groups have criticized Bahrain for its crackdown on anti-government protests that started in February 2011 spurred by popular uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt. But the protests failed to gain the traction of other Arab Spring uprisings after Bahraini authorities moved against demonstrators in February and March last year -- backed by troops from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Protesters and Bahraini authorities have continued to clash, with the opposition accusing the government of being heavy-handed. In November, Bahrain's Independent Commission of Inquiry issued a report highly critical of the crackdown. The commission, set up by the king, concluded that police had used excessive force and torture last year. The report recommended reforms to the country's laws and better training of its security forces. Boy, 11, detained in Bahrain crackdown .

"(CNN) -- The European Tour has dropped Bahrain from its 2012 schedule. The second Volvo Golf Champions tournament was due to be played at the Royal Golf Club, a course designed by British golfer Colin Montgomerie, in January next year. But following a crackdown on anti-government protestors that left at least 32 people dead the European Tour has decided to drop Bahrain from the schedule, for now at least. ""With work still ongoing to resolve issues in Bahrain and the need to confirm the venue by the end of July 2011, the difficult decision to postpone the event for 2012 was taken,"" the Tour said in a statement. But Bahrain would, it confirmed, remain on its roster. ""We know that Bahrain is working hard to address the issues it has faced in recent months, as well as to reach out to the international community,"" said George O'Grady from the European Tour. ""We, together with the European Tour players, look forward to returning and building on that first, very successful, event in the future."" The postponement of next January's tournament will be seen as another blow to a Bahrain government keen to show the world that stability has returned to the island following months of anti-government unrest. In June motor sport's governing body, the FIA, cancelled Bahrain's 2011 F1 Grand Prix amid security fears. Red Bull's Australian driver Mark Webber raised ethical concerns about hosting a major sporting event in the Kingdom. ""In my personal opinion, the sport should have taken a much firmer stance earlier this year rather than constantly delaying its decision in the hope of being able to reschedule it in 2011,"" Webber wrote on his personal web site in June. ""It would have sent a very clear message about F1's position on something as fundamental as human rights and how it deals with moral issues."" FIFA has also asked the Bahraini authorities to explain the jailing of several national football team players. Alaa Hubail, a striker who played 52 times for his country, was sentenced to two years in prison for his involvement in ""illegal protests"". A spokesperson for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights condemned the sentences being handed down to protestors. ""There are serious concerns that the due process rights of the defendants, many of whom are well-known human rights defenders, were not respected and the trials appear to bear the marks of political persecution,"" said Ravina Shamdasani. When asked by CNN about the arrest of the footballers the Bahraini FA confirmed several had been arrested, but claimed they had been treated fairly according to the law. ""The players have been arrested, investigated and detained for having opposed the general laws and bylaws of the country,"" the vice-president of the Bahraini Football Association, Sheikh Ali bin Khalifa al Khalifa, told CNN back in June before Hubail's sentence was handed down.

"(CNN) -- Fabrice Muamba's fellow footballers rallied around the Bolton player after he was admitted to hospital following a possible heart attack during a match on Saturday. The midfielder was in critical condition in intensive care, the English Premier League club confirmed. He collapsed for no apparent reason four minutes before halftime in the FA Cup quarterfinal at Tottenham in London, and the match was abandoned. ""Come on Fabrice Muamba, praying for you,"" Manchester United star Rio Ferdinand wrote on Twitter. Ferdinand's clubmate and fellow England international Wayne Rooney added: ""Hope fabrice muamba is ok. Praying for him and his family. Still in shock."" Muamba in hospital's heart attack center after collapse . Arsenal's England midfielder Jack Wilshere played with the 23-year-old while on loan at Bolton during the 2009-10 season. ""Hope Muamba is okay. Thoughts with him,"" the 20-year-old tweeted. Muamba began his career at Arsenal, where he came through the youth ranks with defender Justin Hoyte, who now plays for second division club Middlesbrough. ""I seriously hope my best friend in football is OK. Stay strong bro please please stay strong.

"(CNN) -- Wesley Sneijder's future at Inter Milan is in doubt after the Italian club confirmed on Saturday that the Dutch playmaker will not be considered for selection until he agrees to take a pay cut. The 28-year-old is one of football's highest-paid players, but he has struggled to regain the heights of 2010 when he helped the Netherlands reach the World Cup final after a treble-winning season with Inter. He has not played for the cash-strapped Serie A side since September 26, at least partially due to injuries, but now Inter technical director Marco Branca says he will stay on the sidelines until he accepts a ""contract adjustment."" ""The situation with Wes, who is part of the history of this club and a player we all care about, is that we've been discussing a possible -- and for us necessary -- adjustment to his contract for a while,"" Branca said in quotes reported by Inter's website. ""We want to give the player and his entourage all the time they need to consider the terms of our proposal carefully, so the coach and the club have decided not to use the player in this period until things are clearer. This also allows our coach to give more playing time to the other players."" In the same interview, Branca revealed that Inter coach Andrea Stramaccioni will not have any funds to bolster his second-placed team's title charge during the January transfer window. ""As things stand, the current economic situation -- both generally speaking and in our specific case -- doesn't allow us to budget for any sort of outlay,"" Branca said. When asked if Inter could afford to sign highly-rated Brazil midfielder Paulinho, Branca replied: ""If there's a 'costs' we can't do it at the moment."" The announcement is likely to spark a January bidding war for former Real Madrid star Sneijder, who has been linked with a move to the English Premier League for the past two years. Inter's financial problems mirror those of city rivals AC Milan, who have sold several top names since winning the Italian title in 2011. Branca said Inter would not be rushing Sneijder, who moved to the San Siro in 2009 and has more than two and a half years left on his contract. ""It's a very serious matter. We're patient precisely because we have a certain sort of relationship with Wes, and I'm sure it's the same for him. We're patient and calm as we wait for the situation to evolve."" Stramaccioni's team travel to Parma on Monday, facing the possibility that champions Juventus' four-point lead will be even greater following Sunday's trip to struggling Milan. In Saturday's only Serie A game, seventh-placed Catania lost 3-1 at Palermo. Slovenia midfielder Josep Ilicic scored twice in the second half to lift the Sicilian team up to 14th place.","Dutch midfielder Wes Sneijder in contract dispute with Inter Milan .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Acura apologized Wednesday for a casting document that called for an African-American actor who was ""not too dark"" in the car company's Super Bowl ad. The controversial casting call document, published Wednesday by the celebrity gossip site TMZ, ""pulls back the curtain"" on the widely known practice of casting based on skin tone in Hollywood, a longtime manager said. TMZ reported that it got the audition posting from ""an African-American actor who didn't fit the profile, and who's pissed."" The role was for an ""African-American Car Dealer"" who would appear in a car showroom scene with Jerry Seinfeld. Jay Leno also appeared in the ad. The sheet's ""role details"" read: ""Nice Looking, friendly. Not too dark. Will work with a MAJOR COMEDIAN."" Acura spokesman Gary Robinson told CNN that the company did not know about the casting description until the TMZ story was published. ""Any of the creative directions didn't come from Acura,"" Robins said. ""They would've come from the casting agency."" Cathi Carlton Casting, the agency hired by Acura to choose actors, declined comment. An employee who answered the phone at the agency's Santa Monica, California, office said they would defer to Acura's apology. ""We apologize to anyone offended by the language on the casting sheet used in the selection of actors for one of our commercials,"" Acura said in a statement to CNN. ""We sought to cast an African-American in a prominent role in the commercial, and we made our selection based on the fact that he was the most talented actor."" Acura said it was ""taking appropriate measures to ensure that such language is not used again in association with any work performed on behalf of our brand."" Longtime Hollywood manager Roger Neal said he was not shocked that a casting director would choose based on skin tone. ""People in the business a long time deal with this every day,"" he said. But Neal, who has looked at daily casting breakdowns for 31 years, said he was surprised the description was written on a casting document. ""I've never seen it in writing before,"" Neal said. ""No one has been bold enough to put it in writing."" The publication of the casting sheet ""pulls back the curtain"" on the casting practice, he said. Neal said he suspects it was an inexperienced casting assistant who wrote the description. Casting agents have told him in the past that his clients were too dark, or ""not black enough,"" Neal said. A euphemism in Hollywood is to tell a rejected actor that the casting director ""went a different direction"" when their race cost them an acting job, Neal said. SAG-AFTRA, the actors union, ""immediately reached out to the casting office when the notice was brought to our attention so we could discuss the specific language used,"" it said in a statement sent to CNN Wednesday. ""Despite the intention behind it, the notice was clearly not as well stated as it could have been and this is an area in which SAG-AFTRA's equal employment opportunities and diversity staff can help,"" the union said. CNN's Chris Dignam contributed to this report.","Casting sheet calls for an African-American actor, ""Nice looking, friendly. Not too dark.""

"(CNN) -- Inter Milan coach Andrea Stramaccioni has rejected suggestions that Wesley Sneijder has been ""victimized"" in his pay dispute with the Italian football club. The Dutch midfielder, who earns a reported $290,000 a week, has been asked to extend his contract by an extra year to 2016 for the same total salary as cash-trapped Inter seek to cut costs. Last weekend the club said the 28-year-old would not be selected until he agreed to the new conditions, a move which has angered the international players' union FIFPro. ""Clubs say that players must respect contracts, but why should that not apply in reverse?"" FIFPro secretary general Theo van Seggelen said last week. ""It is not as if Sneijder has taken a gun to the head of the board of Inter to force them to submit that contract. The club offered it to him with their full understanding."" Messi's Barcelona set new record . However, Stramaccioni insists that he has not picked Sneijder -- who was one of Inter's key players in the 2009-10 treble-winning season under Jose Mourinho -- because of footballing reasons. ""It's my job to pick the best team available, and at the moment I'm not picking him,"" Stramaccioni said after Sunday's 1-0 win at home to Palermo, which kept Inter in third place -- four points behind leaders Juventus. ""This has nothing to do with his contract, I have to select the team and Inter come first. It's not a case of the president telling me not to pick Sneijder, I pick the team. And I think it's outrageous to suggest Sneijder is being 'victimized.' ""We should be careful when using terms such as 'victimized.' If someone who earns 1,000 euros a month heard us, we'd look a bit silly. It's my job to decide who's in the best shape to play and I do so. I make my decisions and I stand by them."" FIFPro says it will demand action from football's ruling bodies against clubs which seek to ""blackmail"" players into accepting reduced terms. ""This type of practice used to be an exception. Unfortunately, we now see clubs in all countries in Europe using this type of measure. For us, the time has come to sound the bell,"" Van Seggelen said. He cited another prominent example in Spain striker Fernando Llorente, who has been dropped by Athletic Bilbao after refusing to assign a new deal. ""If you want to offer a player a lower contract, you must only do that at the end of his current contract,"" Van Seggelen said. The Nerazzurri won on Sunday thanks to a 74th-minute own goal by defender Santiago Garcia, whose struggling Palermo team is coached by Gian Piero Gasperini -- sacked by Inter last season after only five games in charge. Napoli stayed second with a 5-1 thrashing of bottom club Pescara, as Uruguay striker Edinson Cavani and Swiss midfielder Gokhan Inler scored twice each. Cavani has now fired 10 league goals this season, putting him second behind AC Milan's Stephan El Shaarawy. Fiorentina retained fourth place despite being held 2-2 by Sampdoria, who canceled out two goals by Montenegro defender Stefan Savic before having Shkodran Mustafi sent off at the end. Lazio joined Fiorentina on 29 points with a 2-1 win at home to Parma, with veteran Germany striker Miroslav Klose netting the second goal for his ninth this season. In Spain, fourth-placed Real Betis kept pace with the leading clubs after winning 3-2 at Deportivo La Coruna, as striker Ruben netted the opening two goals. Second-bottom Deportivo leveled with two goals from striker Riki, but Betis snatched victory through on-loan Costa Rica winger Joel Campbell. Levante stayed seventh after being held 1-1 by Celta Vigo. In Germany, Werder Bremen moved up to eighth place with a 4-1 win at third-bottom Hoffenheim as Austrian striker Marko Arnautovic scored a hat-trick. Wolfsburg moved four points above the relegation zone after coming from behind to draw 1-1 at home to ninth-placed Hamburg.","Wesley Sneijder again not selected for Inter Milan's win over Palermo on Sunday .

"(CNN) -- Bahrain Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa has insisted Sunday's grand prix in the Gulf kingdom will go ahead despite continued anti-government protests on the country's streets. As the first practice session got underway at the Sakhir circuit, the Crown Prince and Formula One chief Bernie Eccelstone defended the decision to press ahead with the race, amid continuing demonstrations. The Force India team decided not to take part in Friday's second practice session, opting to return to their hotel before night fell. On Thursday a petrol bomb exploded near a car carrying four of their staff back to the capital Manama. The Bahrain Grand Prix was canceled twice in 2010 and several UK politicians, as well as human rights group Amnesty International, have called for this year's installment to be shelved. Why is Bahrain F1 race under fire? On the track, Mercedes' Nico Rosberg continued the impressive form which saw him clinch his first ever F1 victory at last week's Chinese Grand Prix by posting the fastest overall time. But at an impromptu press conference, the Crown Prince was inundated with questions relating to off-track matters. He said: ""Canceling the race just empowers extremists. For those of us trying to navigate a way out of this political problem, having the race allows us to build bridges across communities and celebrate our nation as an idea that is positive not divisive. ""We are not trying to say we are perfect, we are a real country with real issues. I genuinely believe this race is a force for good, it unites many people from many religious backgrounds under the roof of Formula One. ""This race should continue because it a big event for this country, it is important economically and socially. I absolutely can guarantee that any problems that may or may not happen are not directed at Formula One. ""There are people who are out to cause chaos. The attack that happened around Force India was aimed at the police, it was unprovoked and quite dangerous. At no time was anyone from Formula One in danger. Vettel aims to bounce back in Bahrain . ""I'm very confident that protests which will happen at some point, there's one today, is part of the political process in any country. The race is the race and we are here to celebrate that. I'm here to go racing."" Eccelstone maintained that the protests in Bahrain and the arrival of Formula One were unrelated. ""If people have got a complaint about something else it is nothing to do with F1."" On the track, German Rosberg was half a second clear of Red Bull's Mark Webber in practice, while reigning world champion Sebastian Vettel came fourth. McLaren's Lewis Hamilton was fourth with Rosberg's teammate Michael Schumacher sixth. Rosberg told his team's official website his fast pace represented a good start to the weekend: ""Whilst it's nice to be quickest today, we know that doesn't count. The most important thing still is to improve our race pace. ""For the moment, it looks reasonable but we need to analyze where we are on high fuel levels compared to our competitors and draw our conclusions. The conditions are really tough out there, so the race will be quite demanding from the tire perspective."" Force India chose not to participate in the afternoon session so their staff could return to the team's hotel before dark. Their decision comes a day after four of their team were caught up in an anti-government protest on their way back from the track, when a petrol bomb was thrown near to their car. Deputy team principal Robert Fearnley told CNN World Sport: ""The most important thing for us is that we've got to have the well being of our crew foremost in our minds. That is what the objective was. ""Unfortunately we had an experience that was uncomfortable on Wednesday evening. We haven't seen anything since, there hasn't been any issues since, it was just an unfortunate destabilizing program.""","Bahrain Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa insists grand prix will go ahead .

"(CNN) -- Organizers for the controversial Bahrain Grand Prix have been given a boost after several Formula One teams, including world champions Red Bull, told CNN they will not unilaterally pull out of the race. Following reports this week that some teams were planning on canceling their appearance at the grand prix, which is due to take place April 22 at the Bahrain International Circuit on the Persian Gulf island, CNN contacted all 12 constructors. Nine declined to comment but Red Bull, whose driver Sebastian Vettel won the drivers' championship and who also clinched the 2011 constructors' title, told CNN that the decision on whether the Bahrain Grand Prix goes ahead is a matter for motorsport's governing body the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile [FIA] and not individual teams. Teams won't pull out . ""It's up to the FIA,"" a Red Bull spokesperson said. ""We take part in the F1 championship and if that calendar includes a race in Bahrain then we will be racing in Bahrain. It's not up to the teams to pick and choose which races we take part in. ""The FIA are the ones monitoring the situation. They are the ones who make a decision based on what is happening on the ground and we take their guidance."" Bernie Ecclestone, the driving force behind Formula One, had earlier stated that it is up to the individual teams to decide whether they would race in Bahrain. ""We've no way we can force people to go there,"" he told the UK Press Association. ""We can't say 'you've got to go' -- although they would be in breach of their agreement with us if they didn't go -- but it doesn't help. Commercially they have to go, but whether they decide to or not is up to them. I've had no one say anything other than 'we're going to be racing in Bahrain'."" By not racing in Bahrain, any Formula One team would be breaking the Concorde Agreement -- a commercial contract between FIA, Ecclestone's Formula One Administration and the teams -- and would be liable to potentially ruinous multi-million-dollar censure. ""Teams are unable to cancel grands prix,"" replied the Formula One Team Association (FOTA). ""We race in an international series called the FIA Formula One world championship, and it is therefore for the FIA to offer the teams guidance on these issues."" A year of protests . Controversy has raged over the Bahrain Grand Prix ever since an uprising against the ruling Al Khalifa royal family rocked the kingdom just over a year ago. Pro-democracy protests were crushed, with dozens killed in the ensuing violence. Last year's race was canceled as a result but protests have continued in the run up to this year's race. Local human rights groups claim that abuses have continued despite government assurances to the contrary. ""If Formula One go ahead with the race it will give the impression that everything is back to normal when everything is not back to normal. People are dying on a daily basis,"" Nabeel Rajab, head of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights, told CNN. ""I say think of the human rights, think of things other than just your profit and your interest. Human rights have to come first,"" he added. ""We will welcome you back when everything is back to normal, when the killing and arrests have stopped in the streets."" However, Zayed al Zayani, chairman of the Bahrain International Circuit (BIC) where the F1 race will be staged, insisted that safety would not be a problem and blamed the crisis on press ""scaremongering."" ""What has been happening is that armchair observers -- who have not been sufficiently interested or committed to investigate the situation for themselves -- have been driving this debate, at the expense of those neutral parties who have taken the trouble to investigate the situation at first hand,"" Zayani said in a statement released to CNN. ""This, combined with the scaremongering tactics of certain small extremist groups on social networking sites, has created huge misconceptions about the current situation."" Negative publicity . Such has been the negative publicity surrounding the race, BIC released a statement on Monday quoting British parliamentary MP Ben Wallace, the British Ambassador to Bahrain Iain Lindsay and the Lotus F1 team as saying that Bahrain was safe and the race should go ahead. But that move backfired when the Lotus F1 team criticized BIC for using their quotes without permission. ""These quotes were part of a full internal and confidential working document, that was also sent on a confidential basis to all F1 team managers last week,"" Lotus F1 said in their statement. ""Lotus F1 Team is one of 12 contestants of the Formula One world championship and we would never try to substitute ourselves for the FÃ©dÃ©ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), which is the only party entitled to determine if a grand prix should go ahead or not."" The situation has been further exacerbated by the condition of human rights activist Abdulhadi al Khawaja, who has been on hunger strike for close to two months after being jailed for life charged with plotting to overthrow the state. International rights organizations, including Amnesty International, have called for his release. According to the British newspaper The Independent, Ecclestone reportedly phoned a leading writer and activist in Bahrain to check on Al Khawaja's condition and even offered to host a press conference with opposition figures. ""(Mr Ecclestone) said he was very concerned about what is going on,"" Dr. Ala'a Shehabi told The Independent. ""He said the crown prince (Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa) told him that Al Khawaja was doing fine, but I said that I am hearing very different reports."" Decision Sunday? This weekend will see the Shanghai Grand Prix take center stage. ""As it stands we're due to fly there (Bahrain) straight from Shanghai so a decision on whether the race takes place could be taken as late as Sunday morning,"" a spokesman for the Toro Rosso team told CNN. ""Clearly it's a situation that we would like to see resolved as soon as possible. I certainly don't think it will be a case of some teams going and some not going. It will be everybody or nobody. ""The team bosses will have a meeting in China ... Bernie Ecclestone will of course be there and I'm sure they will thrash something out."" Although several former drivers, like the British 1996 world champion Damon Hill, have voiced concerns over the Bahrain Grand Prix, the current crop has been largely silent on whether the race should be won. ""If we go, it's a good decision to make,"" two-time world champion Vettel told CNN Wednesday. ""If we don't go, we don't go.""","Leading F1 teams tell CNN they won't pull out of Bahrain GP .

"(CNN) -- Football's global governing body FIFA will examine Bahrain's ""unusual"" 10-0 World Cup qualifying win over Indonesia on Wednesday. In order to advance to the next stage of the Asian qualifying section for the 2014 tournament, Bahrain needed to win handsomely and have Qatar lose to Iran. Bahrain, coached by former England caretaker manager Peter Taylor, looked well on the way to overcoming a nine-goal differential deficit on Qatar, as Indonesia's goalkeeper was sent off early in the match. But 2022 World Cup hosts Qatar scored an 86th-minute equalizer to secure a place in the fourth phase along with Group E winners Iran. South Korea and Lebanon advance .

Bahrain had scored just three goals in five previous Group E matches, while Indonesia had lost every game -- conceding 16 goals in the process. In September's match between the two teams, Bahrain registered a 2-0 win in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta to bring head-to-head encounters level at two victories each and two draws. Brazil will host the tournament for the second time in 2014, having won it on a record five occasions.

"(CNN) -- Wild Oats XI claimed a sixth victory in the Sydney to Hobart yacht race on Thursday after producing a record time to see off the opposition. The super-maxi crossed the line with an official time of one day, 18 hours, 23 minutes and 12 seconds to claim victory in the prestigious 628-nautical mile bluewater classic. It broke its own previous record of one day, 18 hours, 40 minutes and 10 seconds, which it set back in 2005. It also won the race every year from 2005-08 and in 2010 but last year was narrowly beaten by Investec Loyal, which finished a distant second this time under the new name of Ragamuffin Loyal. ""Last year we were beaten by by three minutes, which was very disappointing. This year we beat them by much more,"" skipper Mark Richards told the race's official website after coming home with 45 nautical miles to spare. The record had looked like slipping out of his grasp as conditions lightened going up the Derwent River, but Richards ordered a bigger mainsail to keep momentum going. ""We just kept chipping away. You expect it to be light in the Derwent and it did get lighter towards the end. This is a very testing event and the Derwent is very, very, testing. It's always a tough race,"" he said. ""We had some very hard and fast running conditions; we blew out a spinnaker and had some gear failure, so it wasn't all smooth sailing."" Most of the crew have been together since 2005, with Steve Jarvin celebrating his 25th race with a record 10th line honors victory. Official race website . Wild Oats became only the second boat in the event to break its own record. ""We'll try to do it again next year,"" owner Bob Oatley said. ""New wings on the keel helped enormously I'm sure, so did the new jib. The design, the crew, the sails and the modifications are what makes the boat fast."" Ragamuffin Loyal, skippered by 85-year-old Syd Fischer, was confirmed in second ahead of Lahana after being cleared of making an early start on Wednesday. An international jury ruled Friday that race officials had failed to inform Fischer that he had jumped the gun. Fischer was left to rue problems with damaged headsail equipment on the first night of the race. ""We had a bit of trouble,"" he said after finishing his 44th Sydney-Hobart in one day, 23 hours and eight minutes and 44 seconds. ""We're new to the boat, we've only had it two months. I think we did pretty well. The boys pushed the boat really hard, it's just unfortunate that things broke or went wrong."" The race, being held for the 68th time, is known as one of the toughest in the world. The 1998 edition ended with just 44 of the 115 entries completing the journey, as five boats sank and six people died. Living Doll was the first yacht of the 76-strong fleet to withdraw from this year's event, suffering a broken rudder near the middle of Bass Strait, 90 nautical miles north east of Flinders Island. ""The Race Committee has been advised that the crew are all in good shape and that they are managing by themselves.

"(CNN) -- Bahrain is adopting a zero tolerance policy toward ""torture, inhuman treatment and degrading detention"" practices toward political prisoners -- one of a number of recommendations made by an independent commission looking into claims of abuse during a crackdown on protesters earlier this year. The government announced the policy in a statement released by the state-run Bahrain News Agency on Wednesday evening. The moves follows last month's report by an independent commission that found police tortured and used excessive force against civilians arrested during a crackdown on the protests that followed successful uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia. The oil-rich kingdom, according to the statement, is committed to implementing the recommendations ""in their entirety."" The government plans to reinstate all government employees who were fired after they were charged with ""free speech activity,"" the statement said. The government also is ordering that all pending cases of ""cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment"" be transferred to its top judicial office for investigation. Additionally, Bahrain is ordering the use of audio-video equipment during interviews with suspects, witnesses and detainees, the statement said. The move follows news over the weekend that Bahrain plans to drop charges related ""to speech protected by the right to freedom of expression,"" the news agency said. Forty-three cases applying to 343 people will benefit from the announcement, it said. Demonstrations demanding political reform and greater freedoms in Sunni-ruled, Shiite-majority Bahrain began February 14 before authorities -- backed by troops from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates -- cracked down in two waves, first in February and later in mid-March. Thirty civilians and five security officers were killed during that time, the commission said. Opposition groups say more than 1,000 people -- mainly Shiites -- have been detained for allegedly taking part in the demonstrations. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.","Bahrain's government is adopting recommendations made by an independent commission .

"(CNN) -- Racist abuse, missiles from the crowd, a pitch invader and five goals in an action-packed thriller -- Sunday's 164th Manchester derby epitomized all that is good and bad about English football. On the field, Manchester United snatched a 3-2 victory that gave Alex Ferguson's team a healthy six-point lead from second-placed Premier League champions City. But the non-sporting incidents continued -- in tune with more than a year of controversies that have plagued arguably the world's most lucrative and widely supported domestic soccer competition, starting with the John Terry-Anton Ferdinand racism incident in October 2011. Hooliganism was once known as the ""English disease"" -- but the game's malady is more pervasive than mere violence. This time Ferdinand's older brother Rio was involved, being hit in the face by a coin as he celebrated Robin van Persie's injury-time winner. While the former England international wiped the blood from his face, City goalkeeper Joe Hart intervened to confront a fan who had invaded the pitch -- police then hauled him from the ground. The Greater Manchester force also reported after the match that another man had been arrested inside City's Etihad Stadium on suspicion of chanting racist abuse. ""It's disappointing that after a great game and advert for the Premier League that we are discussing this issue,"" said the English Football Association in a statement on Sunday. ""We will work with the clubs and authorities to identify those responsible and support the strongest sanctions available, including life bans. ""We condemn any such acts and it is simply unacceptable that any player is exposed to injury in this way. To witness Rio Ferdinand leaving the field with a cut above his eye to receive treatment is appalling."" United manager Alex Ferguson also condemned the transgressions, calling for action by the authorities as he cited similar problems during October's controversial clash at Chelsea -- which saw ref Mark Clattenburg accused of racism before being cleared, and John Obi Mikel fined and banned for confronting the official after the match. Revived Torres fires up Chelsea . ""It was disappointing that a supporter ran on the field after Rio had been hit by a coin in the eye,"" Ferguson told MUTV. ""It's a bit disappointing. The game didn't deserve that. ""I don't know whether they're going to stitch it or not. The same thing happened at Chelsea with all the carry-on when half a seat hit Michael Carrick and coins and lighters were thrown on. The game doesn't need that."" City released an apologetic statement afterwards promising to investigate, but Ferdinand laughed off the coin attack as he posted on his Twitter account after the game. ""What a result, 3 points! Sweet! Whoever threw that coin, what a shot! Can't believe it was a copper 2p....could have at least been a £1 coin!,"" the 34-year-old wrote. ""Respect to Joe Hart for protecting that idiot who ran on!! Love the banter between fans but there is a point when it goes too far...calm it!"" The problems also extended to the internet, with the Greater Manchester Police reporting on Twitter that it is investigating reports of racist tweets. Earlier it had reported that a man had been arrested outside the Etihad Stadium on suspicion of ticket touting, but a prematch prediction from the man in charge of policing the game proved wide of the mark. ""I have every confidence this match will mirror the two derbies last season and the football will be the only talking point,"" Superintendent Craig Thompson said. Last season City thrashed United 6-1 at Old Trafford on the same day that Terry clashed with Queens Park Rangers' Anton Ferdinand. The fallout from that incident cost the Chelsea player the England captaincy, then he was cleared of racial abuse in court before being fined and banned by the English Football Association. Roberto Mancini's team won 1-0 in the home derby on April 30 before claiming the 2011-12 league title on goal difference from Ferguson's men on the final day of the season. Mancini's role at the Abu Dhabi-owned club has become more precarious since then, with City crashing out of the UEFA Champions League at the group stage for the second season in a row. Sunday's defeat ended City's 21-match unbeaten run in the EPL, 15 of those this season, and halted a run of 37 matches without defeat at home which stretched back to December 2010. Van Persie scored a last-gasp winner for United, firing in a free-kick that was deflected past Hart, whose team had fought back from a 2-0 halftime deficit. ""It's very hard to lose a derby, but even more so in the last minute, so I'm very disappointed,"" Mancini said. ""We dominated the second half, and for this reason I am really disappointed. ""They scored from their first two goal-scoring opportunities but after that we dominated the game and fought back really well -- but we can't then give a goal away after working so hard. ""I think we made a mistake for the Van Persie free-kick at the end by only putting three men in the wall. I wanted four but I couldn't get the instruction over and I think that cost us the goal. We should have defended this free-kick better and we had chances to win this game, but there is nothing we can do about it now."" United had conceded first in 15 of 23 games so far this season, but a double inside the opening half hour from Wayne Rooney -- which made the 27-year-old England striker the youngest player to score 150 in the EPL -- put Ferguson's team in the driving seat. United winger Ashley Young had a goal disallowed for offside after Van Persie hit the woodwork just before the hour, and City reduced the deficit 60 seconds later through midfielder Yaya Toure before defender Pablo Zabaleta drove in a low shot from an 86th-minute corner. However, Van Persie had the final say as he netted his 11th league goal since signing from Arsenal for $38 million in August, with City midfielder Samir Nasri guilty of backing away in his position in the defensive wall and sticking out a leg to divert the ball past a helpless Hart in the second of four extra minutes. City substitute Carlos Tevez, who came on for Mario Balotelli seven minutes after the break, was lucky to avoid punishment after aiming a wild kick at United's Phil Jones late in the match. Meanwhile, Everton moved up to fourth place with a 2-1 victory at home to Tottenham on Sunday thanks to injury-time goals from Steven Pienaar and Nikica Jelavic. Clint Dempsey had opened the scoring in the 76th minute for Spurs, who dropped to fifth above West Brom on goal difference. Liverpool claimed 10th place with a 3-2 victory at West Ham, as James Collins conceded a late own goal after Glen Johnson and Joe Cole scored against their former club.","Manchester United go six points clear in Premier League with 3-2 derby win .

"(CNN) -- Lindsey Vonn might have surrendered her World Cup crown, the American skier is not giving her heir apparent Tina Maze a free run to glory. Vonn upstaged the Slovenian on her home course at Maribor to claim the 59th World Cup win of her career in Saturday's giant slalom. Maze, who has already sealed this season's giant slalom title, finished second to extend her overall lead to 748 points from Germany's Maria Hofl-Riesch, who was fourth behind Anna Fenninger of Austria. ""It was my first GS race since my comeback and I didn't know I would be able to win today,"" said Vonn, who took almost a month out after suffering stomach problems. ""Training went well this week and the conditions were perfect today for a good performance. I know I can ski well in Maribor, the slope suits me. It's just that I never managed to have two clean runs together."" She is now three wins behind Annemarie Moser-Proll's record of 62, having picked up just her third giant slalom victory and her first since she clinched a fourth World Cup title in March 2012. ""The timing for the world championships could not be more perfect. This is a highlight after a tough moment. It also convinced me I could do well in giant slalom and I will race in four events at the worlds,"" Vonn said, referring to the February 4-17 event in Schladming, Austria . Maze had led after the first run, but Vonn came from third to win by 0.08 seconds in front of 25,000 spectators. ""I was skiing to win but unfortunately I made a mistake on top and that wasn't sufficient to beat Lindsey,"" said the 29-year-old Maze, who will line up again in Sunday's slalom. ""I am happy with today. It is an incredible feeling to race in front of so many people cheering for you! I could hear them from top to bottom. Of course it is not easy to race when everybody expects you to win. This adds a little bit of pressure. But there is another race tomorrow and I'm looking forward to it."" Meanwhile, Italian skier Dominik Paris celebrated his second victory this season after winning the prestigious downhill race at Kitzbuhel in Austria, one of the most feared runs on the men's circuit. Paris topped his only previous World Cup win -- a dead heat tie for first with Hannes Reichelt in Bormio at the end of last year -- with a time of one minute 57.56 seconds. ""This is the best victory one could have in a winter. Bormio was my first and for sure it's special, but winning Kitzbuehel is something I wanted to do since I was about six years old so this is a dream come true,"" the 23-year-old said. This time Reichelt (1:57.69) had to settle for third place behind Canada's Erik Guay (1:57.92). Norway's Aksel Lund Svindal finished ninth to be 59 points behind leader Marcel Hirscher in the race for the overall title.","U.S. skier Lindsey Vonn wins 59th World Cup race of career in Slovenia on Saturday .

"(CNN) -- Formula One bosses are under increasing pressure to review their decision to stage the Bahrain Grand Prix later this month. A British politician added his voice to the growing chorus of dissent on Friday saying motorsport officials should ""rethink"" their plans. ""In hindsight, the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) should not have scheduled the 2012 race so early in the season,"" said Richard Burden, a Labor member of parliament. ""It was always going to be too early to know how far things had moved on in Bahrain since last year. F1 can't turn the clock back but, with three weeks to go before the race, it can still rethink. It should do so,"" he added. ""In a context where genuine and sustainable reform is taking place, holding a Grand Prix could be a unifying event for the people of Bahrain as well as a positive showcase on the world stage. But things are not at that stage."" The calls come amid continuing unrest in the country with demonstrators and Bahraini authorities continuing to clash. Burden's words echo those made by former British F1 world champion Damon Hill on Thursday, who said running the race now could create more problems than it solves. ""It would be a bad state of affairs, and bad for Formula One, to be seen to be enforcing martial law in order to hold the race. That is not what this sport should be about,"" Hill said. Most recently, Bahraini officials have arrested the daughter of the human rights activist Abdulhadi al-Khawaja who is currently on hunger strike to protest the life sentence he received for his alleged role in the ongoing unrest. In February, the country's Formula One organizers, the Bahrain International Circuit (BIC) insisted the race would go ahead. But Nabeel Rajab, the president of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights (a group started by al-Khawaja) urged officials to reverse the decision. ""If Formula One go ahead with the race it will give the impression that everything is back to normal when everything is not back to normal. People are dying on a daily basis, Rajab told CNN. ""I say think of the human rights, think of things other than just your profit and your interest. Human rights have to come first,"" he added. ""We will welcome you back when everything is back to normal, when the killing and arrests have stopped in the streets."" However, the BIC insisted that the race would be safe. ""The BIC is in regular contact with the FIA, FOM (Formula One Management) and the Bahrain government,"" it said in a statement. ""All of the above continue to state that the grand prix goes ahead, and we are therefore going about our business of ensuring that this sporting event can be enjoyed by a hundred thousand local spectators, as well as hundreds of millions of viewers around the world. We speak to F1 teams regularly, and have received no communication regarding an unwillingness to race. ""With particular reference to travel advice, Bahrain has had a 'green' travel alert (i.e. no travel restrictions) from the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office for some months now. This rating is safer than even the first race in 2004.""","Calls for motorsport officials to rethink running of Bahrain Grand Prix later this month .

"(CNN) -- Facebook's decision to file for public status later this year means its No. 2 executive, Sheryl Sandberg, might be worth as much as $1.6 billion. According to Forbes, that would catapult her just below the seemingly untouchable Oprah in the ranking of the richest self-made women. She won't have much company: Only 7.5% of the major earners at America's Fortune 500 companies are female. The many media profiles of Sandberg all seem to be asking the same question: How did Sheryl do it? How did she get the confidence to perform so well at such a high level? And perform she has. According to The New York Times, she took Facebook from 70 million users and no business model to profits reaching $1 billion on $3.7 billion in revenue in just four years. Sandberg's own mentor, Larry Summers, ignited a firestorm in 2005 when he wondered publicly whether one reason women weren't achieving at the highest levels in the sciences was a lack of biological aptitude, particularly for math. Before long, he was ousted from his position as president of Harvard -- not officially for this reason -- and the nation was abuzz about women's lack of parity in so many fields and forums. See also: How girl geeks can get the best tech jobs . At that time, about 15% of opinion pieces were written by women, though the imbalance was largely under the radar. The opinion page became a particularly contentious space for an outpouring of women's voices in this overdue conversation. Nationally syndicated columnist Susan Estrich called The Los Angeles Times' leadership out for sexism on its opinion pages. Anne Applebaum of The Washington Post argued with Estrich and said she resented being called a ""female"" journalist. And Maureen Dowd of The New York Times, echoing one of the most commonly held beliefs about why women don't have parity, wrote that women weren't fairly represented because they are afraid of being attacked and care too much about what others think. They lack confidence. But what does that really mean? The notion that women lack confidence implies a negative judgment. It's viewed as a weakness, coded as feminine. But some recent social science research reveals a more likely and complex explanation: People do things because people who look and talk like them or share the same background do those things. See also: Women! Embrace your inner geek . To assume that a lack of confidence is the reason so few women are intellectual leaders is too simplistic. When a woman doesn't go for a big corporate job like Sandberg's or says no when television producers call, saying she doesn't have any confidence implies it's an individual choice made in some sort of sociocultural vacuum. As women, in many cases, the impulse to do something out of the norm of our peer group, like write an opinion piece or ask for a promotion, has simply never occurred to us. If it does, we don't act on it. Our girlfriends aren't doing it. Our female colleagues aren't doing it. Why should we? Peer influence, whether you're a teenage girl trying to figure out what to wear to junior high on Monday morning or a midlevel manager at Morgan Stanley, is a powerful indicator of what you think is possible for yourself. In ""Join the Club: How Peer Pressure Can Transform the World,"" Tina Rosenberg writes, ""The social norms set by our peers dominate our choices about what we value and what we expect in life."" Sandberg, who often urges women to ""lean into"" their careers, must know that you don't lean in alone. She runs a monthly salon for women out of her home, inviting guest speakers like feminist Gloria Steinem and trailblazing Sen. Claire McCaskill. Women of various generations gather and shape their ambitions over a meal and some conversation. See also: Women only hotel rooms take off . At The OpEd Project, we cultivate new voices, training minorities and women to inhabit their place as narrators of the world. The challenge is to shift the way we think about ourselves. We must see our peers and ourselves as leaders who have a right and a responsibility to weigh in on the matters of our day. We have to create a new ecosystem in which we see ourselves as part of the critical conversations of our age and feel equally entitled and compelled to narrate them. Who hasn't heard a parent quip, ""If all of your friends were jumping off of a cliff, would you?"" There's some profound wisdom in that old clichÃ©: If your friends aren't aiming for high-profile corporate leadership or going head-to-head on the Sunday morning talk shows, you're not likely to, either. We can create more Sandbergs by surrounding ourselves with confident, outspoken women. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Courtney Martin and Katie Orenstein.","Writers: Facebook's Sandberg an anomaly; 7.5% of Fortune 500 big earners are female .

"(CNN) -- Egypt's president-elect, Mohamed Morsi, told a packed Tahrir Square on Friday that the people are the source of his authority as the country's first democratically elected leader. ""The whole nation is listening to me,"" he said in Cairo, referring to political and military leaders and all Egyptians. ""There is no authority above the authority of the people."" Morsi will be sworn in Saturday. The incoming president promised to protect the rights of all Egyptians, whether they voted for him or not. ""No rights will be taken from anyone who says no to me,"" he said. The Islamist leader called being elected president a great honor. ""I cherish this mission,"" he said. At the end of his speech, Morsi referred to Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman, the blind Egyptian cleric serving a life sentence in the United States for a conspiracy conviction in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. He said he wanted to work to free political prisoners, which he said include Abdel-Rahman. ""Their rights will be on my shoulders, and I won't spare effort"" to free them, he said. His speech Friday echoed earlier promises he made insisting that he would not create a fundamentalist Islamic state. Morsi leads the Freedom and Justice Party, the political wing of the Muslim Brotherhood, and some Egyptians were concerned about a shift toward an Islamic state. ""I will faithfully execute and preserve the republican system and respect for law and sovereignty,"" he said. Morsi, 60, was declared president Sunday after he took 52% of the vote to 48% for Ahmed Shafik, the final prime minister to serve under President Hosni Mubarak before he was ousted. During the historic campaign for president, Morsi said he would support democracy, women's rights and peaceful relations with Israel if he won. ""I will keep in touch with everyone, and I do not differentiate between supporters and opposition. I will seek advice from you and from Allah almighty,"" he said.","Mohamed Morsi will be sworn in Saturday .

"(CNN) -- It is the ultimate breeding ground for any Formula One star of the future, and a medium endorsed by one of the sport's greatest drivers, Ayrton Senna. Right up until his tragic death in 1994, the three-time world champion from Brazil still raced go-karts, a rough and ready forerunner for those youngsters hoping to make the giant leap to the multi-million-dollar arena of F1. Senna's passion for karts is shared by Mark Webber, who started on his path to stardom as part of the all-conquering Red Bull team by speeding round miniature tracks as a teen. According to the Australian, who still squeezes his giant frame into a go-kart every once in a while, there is no better place to see if kids have what it takes to thrive in the fast-paced world of motorsport. ""Karting is very purist if you like, it's very basic,"" Webber, who was second fastest in practice for Sunday's Indian Grand Prix, told CNN. ""Ayrton Senna was still a huge fan right until the end. ""For him he really enjoyed it and he said he had some of his best racing in go-karts and he had some of his toughest opposition in go-karts, so there's no better endorsement than that. ""I suppose it's like learning new languages when you're young. Karting is the best way for you to get a feel of how to race each other, dealing with the competition, dealing with winning, dealing with losing, and you soak up so much at a young age and learn very fast."" All of F1's stellar names, such as double world champions Sebastian Vettel and Fernando Alonso, McLaren's Lewis Hamilton and seven-time drivers' championship winner Michael Schumacher, started out on karting tracks. Senna, one of the sport's most dynamic drivers, became transfixed with an improvised go-kart made for him as a four-year-old by his father using old parts of an old lawnmower. And though there can be little comparison between the speed and the danger of the two driving disciplines, Webber insists the challenge presented by karting is one that still excites him. ""The difference between go-karts and Formula One is obviously quite extreme. It's from the junior, the most basic form to the most extreme form,"" the 36-year-old said. ""But a lot of Formula One drivers, including myself, still love driving karts because it's very, very raw. ""They still give us a great feel of adrenalin and sensation of speed even though they're not as powerful as what we race week in, week out, but we are low to the ground, you've got to be very precise -- all the things we have to deal with in our profession."" Talent on the track is one thing but Webber says it is vital to have an understanding of the financial workings of motorsport even from an early age. Anyone who reaches the top will reap the rewards that come with F1 success, but it can be an expensive hobby to fund at the start of a driver's career. ""It's not a cheap sport, obviously, so you've got to try to find sponsorship if you can to help mum and dad pay for your go-kart tires and go-kart engines,"" he said. ""If you can, have a good nous and good awareness for the sponsorship side of things as well. I know they're only young but it's important for them to understand that."" Webber's first love was motorbikes, but his switch to four wheels as a 14-year-old paid instant dividends as he won his state go-karting championship in New South Wales. But aside from the titles, the thing he most cherishes about his time in the junior ranks of motorsport was traveling round Australia with his father, who was otherwise kept busy at work. It wasn't until Webber started to enjoy success on a more prestigious stage that he thought his dream of becoming a Formula One driver could turn into a reality. ""There was definitely a moment when I was young and it clicked and I wanted to be a driver at the highest level,"" he said. ""I was completely dreaming then and every day I was dreaming about how far I could get in the sport. ""No-one's that arrogant when they're racing go-karts that (they think) for sure I'm going to be a world champion one day or I'm going to race Formula One or I'm going to do this. ""It's just a process and you get more confidence and you win and you keep moving up. I think it's not until you start getting to Europe and winning races over there that you feel that you can go all the way. ""Because it's in your wildest dreams that you'd ever get to race a Formula One car when you're racing karts.""","Red Bull's F1 driver Mark Webber tells CNN of his love for go-karting .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Two distinctive Egyptian presidential candidates, one representing resurgent Islamists and the other a weathered veteran of the country's old guard, have begun maneuvering for wider political support ahead of an expected runoff next month. Muslim Brotherhood candidate Mohamed Morsi huddled with politicians Saturday to stave off what his campaign sees as a return to the policies of longtime President Hosni Mubarak, toppled last year in the country's historic uprising. ""We face desperate attempts to replicate the old system of governance in new attire that might fool some, but the masses of our people and the enlightened revolutionary forces will not give these the opportunity,"" the Morsi campaign said in a statement. ""We must, together, seek out ways to save the blessed revolution."" Yet his opponent, former Prime Minister Ahmed Shafik, distanced himself from Egypt's deposed leader as he briefed reporters, saying there's ""no going back"" to the Mubarak years. ""We hear talks about deals, compromises that some are trying to make. I assure to you that the only deal that we need to make at this moment is with the Egyptian people,"" Shafik said. ""To all Egyptians from all parties and to all the independents, to the children of April 6 movement, your revolution has been hijacked from you, the revolution that you have started. Therefore, I pledge to you that I will do my best to restore its glory back to you and that you will be in the front lines of this new phase."" There were 13 candidates on the first-round presidential ballot, although two withdrew from the race after ballots were printed. If no candidate gets a majority of the vote in the first round, the top two will progress to a runoff to be held June 16-17. The winner of the landmark vote will become Egypt's first freely elected president. A runoff between Morsi and Shafik appears likely, according to unofficial results reported by Egyptian newspaper Al Ahram Online. Egyptian elections officials said the results being published by the media were ""not inaccurate."" The unofficial Al Ahram count gave Morsi 25% of the vote with results in from all 27 provinces, with Shafik close behind with 24% of the vote. In third at 22% is leftist Hamdeen Sabahy. Morsi is an American-educated engineer who vows to stand for democracy, women's rights and peaceful relations with Israel if he wins the Egyptian presidency. Still, he's an Islamist figure who has argued for barring women from the Egyptian presidency and called Israeli leaders ""vampires"" and ""killers."" Shafik, also a former air force officer with close ties to Egypt's powerful military, is seen as representing the interests of the old guard -- those who lost out when President Mubarak was ousted. On Saturday, Sabahy stressed to reporters that the final results have not yet been announced and said his campaign has filed appeals. ""With the will of the people, we will succeed. The Egyptian administration is looking at evidence of fraud,"" he said, according to his Twitter page. ""All of the evidence proves that we acquired most of the votes and I thank the people for their valuable trust,"" Sabahy said. Al Ahram's count put Abdelmonen Abol Fotoh, a moderate Islamist running as an independent, and Amre Moussa, who previously served as foreign minister and headed the Arab League, in fourth and fifth places, respectively. Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who led a delegation observing the voting, told reporters in Cairo he couldn't say ""the entire process has been proper"" because of some restraints on observers. But the group found the election period to be peaceful, with citizens accepting the voting process as ""quite successful."" ""There were many violations, and I think each violation is serious. But I think collectively they did not affect the basic integrity of the election,"" he said. Carter said there were no apparent patterns in election procedures that ""favored a particular candidate."" Adel Saeed, official spokesman for Egypt's prosecutor-general, said his office is working with the country's election officials to investigate voter ""irregularities."" Most of them are from the Morsi, Shafik and Moussa campaigns. ""This matter will be taken very seriously before the announcement of official results,"" Saeed said. The Presidential Elections Committee has finished its collection and examination of the first-round votes, having ""confirmed and validated (their) safety and accuracy,"" according to a report Saturday from the state-run Egypt News Agency. A meeting will take place Sunday afternoon to discuss appeals, as well as to set the date when the official results will be announced, the report said. ""A lot of Egyptians will feel like this is the worst choice that they would have to make because if it really is between Morsi and Shafik, then these are the two most polarizing candidates,"" Khaled Elgindy, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington who is currently in Egypt. If the first-round results in a runoff between Morsi and Shafik, many Egyptians -- particularly liberals and ""revolutionaries"" -- will be very disappointed, Elgindy said . Sabahy has had the backing of many who supported the Cairo's Tahrir Square uprising last year to protest Mubarak's rule. Sabahy is a proponent of late and revered Egyptian leader Gamal Abdel Nasser, who ruled the country in the '50s and '60s. Elgindy said it is hard to predict where the votes of liberals and revolutionaries will go if they do participate, but the Muslim Brotherhood will have to work hard if it wants to win them over, having alienated many in the past. Many people may opt to stay at home rather than make a ""very difficult choice"" in the runoff, Elgindy said. There is also a chance of further protests and even violence regardless of who wins, Elgindy said, as revolutionary elements become increasingly marginalized and radicalized. Mubarak led the North African nation for 30 years before being forced out last year amid a popular outcry. The voting is a monumental achievement for those who worked to topple Mubarak in one of the seminal developments of the Arab Spring. And it could reverberate far beyond the country's borders, since Egypt is in many ways the center of gravity of the Arab world. Distrust and anger in Egypt, particularly against the military's power in governmental affairs, have inspired continued protests, some of which have been marked by deadly clashes. Many protesters are upset about what they see as the slow pace of reform since Mubarak's ouster. Some are also concerned that the country's military leadership is delaying the transition to civilian rule. Worries about the powerful military possibly swaying this week's vote persist despite the insistence of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces that it will hand over power to an elected civilian government. The military leaders put armored personnel carriers on the streets with loudspeakers broadcasting a message that they will relinquish power, but that did not convince doubters. In January, two Islamist parties -- the Freedom and Justice Party with 235 seats and the conservative Al Nour party with 121 seats -- won about 70% of the seats in the lower house of parliament in the first elections for an elected governing body in the post-Mubarak era. The rest of the assembly's 498 seats were divided among other parties.

"London (CNN) -- Pakistani teen activist Malala Yousufzai was in stable condition at a British hospital on Sunday after undergoing surgeries to repair her skull and help her hearing, officials said. ""Both operations were a success and Malala is now recovering in hospital. Her medical team are 'very pleased' with the progress she has made so far,"" the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham said in a statement. ""She is awake and talking to staff and members of her family."" Saturday's five-hour surgeries were the latest step on a long road to recovery for Malala, who was shot in the head and neck by Taliban gunmen in October for speaking out in favor of education for Pakistani girls. Last week doctors said they would use a titanium plate to cover an opening in her skull, and give her a cochlear implant to partially restore hearing in her left ear. The plate was necessary to replace a section of her skull about the size of a hand, which doctors removed to relieve swelling after the shooting. And the inner ear implant will restore some function to her damaged ear, doctors said last week. The 15-year-old became an international symbol of courage after she was shot by Taliban gunmen last fall for her crusade about girls going to school. She had blogged fearlessly about girls' education and accused the Taliban of thriving on ignorance. The Taliban forbid girls in the classroom and have threatened to kill anyone who defies them. Malala was in a school van on October 9 when the gunmen stopped the vehicle and shot her at point-blank range. She was flown to the British hospital six days later. Doctors there discharged her last month, and she has been recovering with her family at a temporary home nearby. Her father, who had been an educator in Pakistan, is now employed at the Pakistani Consulate in Birmingham. On Sunday, officials said Malala would remain hospitalized until she is well enough to be discharged. CNN's Ben Brumfield, Laura Smith-Spark and Per Nyberg contributed to this report.","Operations to repair Malala's skull and help her hearing ""were a success,"" the hospital says .

"(CNN) -- Soccer stars have plenty of spare time, and plenty of money, so this week's revelations of players gambling on events during English Premier League matches should come as no surprise. Claus Lundekvam's claims that ""spot-fix"" betting was rife when he was a player have attracted the attention of world governing body FIFA, which is also battling against the widespread problem of match-fixing. The Premier League has a well-documented gambling culture, with big names such as Michael Owen and Wayne Rooney owning race horses and featuring in big-stake ""card schools"" on international and club duty. Before them, England internationals Tony Adams and Paul Merson had highly-publicized problems with gambling and alcohol. Former Southampton player Lundekvam is the latest to talk candidly about footballers' vices, revealing that he and other top-flight stars made money out of betting on minor events in games such as the first throw-in or corner kick. Swiss court: Former FIFA president took $1.5M in bribes . ""For a while we did this almost every week,"" Lundekvam told a Norwegian television channel. ""We made a fair bit of money. We could make deals with the opposing captain. ""For example, betting on the first throw, the first corner, who started with the ball, a yellow card or a penalty. Those were the sorts of thing we had influence over. ""The results were never on the agenda. That is something I would never have done. We were professional competitors. Even though what we did, of course, was illegal, it was just a fun thing."" Strict regulations and laws govern what professional footballers are able to gamble on, but are football's lawmakers taking the problem seriously enough? World governing body FIFA released a statement on Wednesday outlining its intention to look into Lundekvam's claims. ""FIFA is monitoring this issue and involved its chief investigator in England,"" FIFA told CNN. ""Once all information is known it will be decided who is leading the investigations."" The Premier League, which recently raised $4.5 billion selling broadcasting rights in Britain, declined to comment on the matter, while the English Football Association gave no indication it would be investigating Lundekvam's claims. ""The FA has strict policies on this and our sanctions are wide-ranging. All participants also have a duty to report any such activity,"" it told CNN. ""Football works closely with the gambling industry to monitor all markets and activity and we have a unit focused on maintaining the integrity of the sport."" While the allegation of illegal activities within ""the beautiful game"" is worrying, it also shines a light on another possible parasite eating away at soccer's top players. Lars Bohinen was an international teammate of Lundekvam's and enjoyed an eight-year Premier League career with Blackburn Rovers, Nottingham Forest and Derby County. The former midfielder said he was not aware of any spot-fixing when he played, but he does recall jokes being made about the subject during his time in England. ""One of the examples Claus put forward was that you could bet on the first throw-in,"" said Bohinen, who retired in 2005. ""I remember we joked about that sometimes, but it was never seriously discussed. It was a rumor which went around at the time. ""I suppose having learned about what's happened it would be naive to think it wasn't there, but I can't say to what extent it was there."" Bohinen did acknowledge that players would bet thousands of pounds on the way to matches. ""It's not well known, but there have been cases,"" he said. ""People could lose Â£3,000 or Â£4,000 on a bus trip to London. Obviously that's not the best way to prepare for a game. ""At one of my clubs they put an end to gambling on the bus on the way to away games. I think there are a lot more problems going on than people get to hear about."" The Premier League's highly-paid players have become celebrities, which can make it even harder to admit to a gambling problem when your fans see you as a sporting hero. ""Gambling addiction is not something players talk about ... They would never come out and say that, but you could sense it from the way they gambled on cards, horses and football,"" Bohinen said. Many sportsmen suffering from addiction problems have turned to the Sporting Chance Clinic, a charity set up by former England captain Adams. ""The issue may be getting to admit there is a problem in the first place,"" said a Sporting Chance spokesperson. ""If you're talking about footballers, there is a very clear, defined process in place."" The Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) -- the union which represents the concerns of players in England and Wales -- refers cases of addiction to Sporting Chance, which offers residential care. ""If you are a professional player at any level, if you are a member of the PFA, there is a huge support network in place which we are part of,"" said the Sporting Chance spokesperson. ""There is a clear, full process in place which we are almost the culmination of. We get to see what you would almost consider the worst cases."" However, PFA management committee chairman Clarke Carlisle suggested greater regulatory scrutiny raised privacy issues and also threatened to make the problem worse. ""We've not had a survey or a general questionnaire about the gambling habits of the players,"" said Carlisle, who was part of the Burnley team which played in the Premier League in the 2009-10 season. ""The problem is that gambling calls into question the integrity of a match and of the sport. ""As a union, we're never going to stop players gambling. If you were to put a blanket ban on it you would just drive it underground. That would only serve to put people in a far more precarious position."" Carlise, who went to Sporting Chance when he battled alcoholism, would like to see the clinic given greater resources. ""I think it's an excellent facility and one which needs to expand. It's a perfect setting to get away from the outside influences of what is going on in your life and really focus on addressing your issues,"" the 32-year-old said. ""In that perfect setting there are people who have an empathy with what is going on in your life, which is the greatest thing anyone can show you."" Carlisle refused to blame the Premier League or the FA for their response to gambling and spot-fixing, saying it is the role of the PFA to understand the needs of footballers. ""You're caught between a rock and a hard place,"" he said. ""I don't think anyone has hit on the solution yet. ""Is it the FA's remit to cure the ills of the individuals within the game? Probably not. It is the PFA's remit to make sure we're aware of the what the lads are going through and the problems they are facing.""","Latest claims of football gambling put spotlight on English Premier League .

"El Arish, Egypt (CNN) -- Clashes intensified Wednesday in Egypt's North Sinai as Egyptian forces launched aerial strikes on militants in response to a series of attacks by masked gunmen on military checkpoints. Egyptian army Apache helicopters fired rockets at armed militants, and there were numerous casualties, said Gen. Ahmed Bakr, head of North Sinai security. State-run Nile TV reported that aerial strikes killed at least 20 in the port town of El Arish. The assault came after masked gunmen launched six simultaneous attacks in North Sinai early Wednesday, wounding five security officers and a civilian. The targets included five security checkpoints and a military cement factory, he said. Egypt's military leadership, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, issued a statement Wednesday saying that the operation targeting ""armed terrorist elements"" in Sinai ""has accomplished this task with complete success."" Two security sources who did not want to be identified because they are not authorized to speak to the media told CNN that militants are concentrated in Jabal Al Halal in mid-Sinai. They are armed with rocket-propelled grenades, anti-aircraft guns and other weapons, including landmines, the sources said. Security forces had failed in previous attempts to enter what is referred to as ""Al Halal Mountain,"" the sources said. But air assaults, which began Tuesday night and were continuing Wednesday, killed many of the militants, they said. Still, land mines and the potential for ambushes made it difficult to enter the area using ground vehicles, they said. Khaled Fouda, the governor of Southern Sinai, declared a state of emergency in all state sectors in the province, including a reduction in the number of tourist buses in order to ensure vehicles servicing tourists will be guarded. A political shakeup occurred amid the violence. The state-run Middle East News Agency said the governor of Northern Sinai was sacked and a new general intelligence agency head chosen after his predecessor received an ""early"" retirement. The violence, which comes days after another attack in Sinai, is a foreign policy test for Egypt's new government and its president, Mohamed Morsy, a former longtime leader in the Muslim Brotherhood's political movement, over its relations with Israel. Islamists such as the Muslim Brotherhood and many other Egyptians abhor Israel and its peace treaty with Egypt. Israel, which borders Sinai, raised concerns about terrorism in the region after Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was ousted last year. Morsy's ""response to this crisis will provide the first real evidence of his oft-stated commitment to foreign diplomats that he will respect Egypt's international agreements, that is, maintain the peace treaty with Israel,"" said Robert Satloff and Eric Trager, analysts with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a Washington-based think tank. Egypt's president condemns deadly attack in Sinai . They wrote that assessment a day after 16 Egyptian soldiers were killed and seven wounded when assailants with semi-automatic weapons and hand grenades stole two armored vehicles from Egyptian forces and tried to enter Israel. The attack, which took place Sunday near the Rafah border crossing, prompted Egypt to block hundreds of smuggling tunnels into the Palestinian territory of Gaza, Bakr said. The Egyptian government shut the Rafah border ""indefinitely"" after the attack. Israel blamed militants associated with the group Global Jihad for the Sunday attack. Egyptian military officials called the assailants ""enemies"" of the nation, while the Muslim Brotherhood said the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad was behind the killings. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack. Israel has handed over the charred remains of six assailants to Egypt, and the remains have been transferred to the Forensic Department in Cairo University for DNA tests in an attempt to identify the perpetrators, according to State TV. A source close to the Egyptian military operation in northern Sinai who did not want to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media told CNN of coordination between Egyptian and Israeli authorities to permit the use ""of combat helicopters and hundreds of additional troops in the demilitarized zone on the Egyptian side."" ""According to the Camp David Accords, both sides must agree before allowing additional troops on either side of the borders. Israel agreed to allow Egypt to move hundreds of additional troops into the Sinai Peninsula for the second time since the January 2011 uprising that toppled Mubarak,"" the source said. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned last month during her visit to Egypt that the desert border between Israel and Egypt could become an ""operational base"" for jihadists if security is not maintained. In an interview with CNN, Clinton said the problem was discussed during her meetings in Egypt and Israel. There is ""the potential of jihadists and terrorists taking up an operational base in Sinai,"" Clinton said in the interview. ""We think this is a dangerous situation for both Egypt and Israel. It is also dangerous for Americans. We have Americans who are part of the multinational force that observes the continuation of the monitoring (of the) Camp David Accord. We have Americans in the Sinai. We've had a few concerns about their safety."" Israel captured the Sinai Peninsula in the 1967 Six-Day War and returned the land to Egypt after the countries signed a peace treaty at Camp David in 1979. Since Mubarak's ouster, ""terrorists have worked continuously to manufacture tensions between Egypt and Israel, attacking the gas pipeline to Israel and Jordan 15 times and launching a deadly cross-border raid on Israel last August that catalyzed a near-crisis in bilateral relations,"" Satloff and Trager said. Satloff and Trager said Morsy ""has sought to cover his bets"" on the Sinai issue. ""On the one hand, he issued a strong declaration condemning the attack, vowed to catch and punish the culprits, and traveled to El Arish with Field Marshal Muhammad Hussein Tantawi to assess the situation himself. On the other hand, he also permitted his Muslim Brotherhood colleagues to issue a venomous statement blaming Israel's intelligence agency, Mossad, for the attack and warning Egyptians to beware of those trying to sabotage the revolution."" But they said a ""responsible leader, one who wants international support to bolster his flagging economy, cannot play childish games that pander to the worst instincts of Egyptian public opinion. Indeed, any serious effort to prevent terrorist infiltration in Sinai requires coordination with Israel, which -- even if kept in the shadows -- cannot proceed in an environment of public vilification."" The paper said that, in light of the Sunday attack, Egypt should make improvements in its Sinai presence and realize that the United States sees Sinai ""as an essential aspect of Egyptian-Israeli peace."" A failure to improve security on the peninsula could trigger an overall reassessment of the U.S. military assistance package, with an eye to updating this 1980s-era relationship for the current environment. ""Last year, under an annex to the treaty with Israel, Egypt was permitted to move an additional seven battalions into the Sinai. Yet these forces are reportedly underequipped and have avoided patrolling terrorist hotspots,"" the paper said, referring to the violence in El Arish and Rafah. ""Moreover, according to reports, Egypt's security presence along the border with Israel is dangerously deficient -- so much so that Israeli patrols are occasionally obliged to provide food and other essentials to their Egyptian counterparts."" CNN's Joe Sterling contributed to this report.","Dealing with Sinai is a foreign policy test for Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy .

"(CNN) -- It's been a long time between wins for Steve Nyman, but the American skier is determined to prove he is over his injury problems. On Saturday Nyman celebrated his first World Cup victory since 2006, having recently returned to top-level action after missing all of last season. The 30-year-old had placed 29th in Friday's Super G race at Val Gardena-Groden, but stormed home in Saturday's downhill after starting 39th in the Italian event. His triumph came in the same Saslong Classic race where he earned his only other career win six years ago, as he earned a podium place for the first time since 2007. The two-time Olympian took advantage of improving conditions to head off Slovenia's surprise second-placer Rok Perko by 0.19 seconds, with Canadian Erik Guay finishing third from Norway's Kjetil Jansrud. Alpine Edge: Inside World Cup venues . ""Weather was a huge factor but hats off to Erik and Jansrud who ran in the snow and the fog,"" Nyman said. ""When I heard Rok coming into the lead I said, 'Right on, it's on, it's open!' ""I've always believed I had the speed. I hope to prove it through the year. But I guess no points to 100 points isn't that consistent. ""I'm just happy to feel good again. My body's feeling good. I had the flu, but battled that off. I had rib issues the first few races because I put it into the fence while training in Copper. The Achilles last year, the knees years before that and the back -- this is the best gift I could have."" Friday's race winner Aksel Lund Svindal was fifth, extending his overall lead to 177 points from absent American Ted Ligety, who will return to action for Sunday's giant slalom across the mountain at Alta Badia. ""Having trouble because of too much snow is in many ways a good thing,"" the Norwegian wrote on his blog on Saturday. ""Snow is good for ski business. And we're all a part of the business. But as a racer and an athlete days like todays like today are tough. ""We want to compete under equal and fair conditions. But sometimes that's not possible in the mountains. We didnt have good conditions but it could have been worse. The poor guys that started first had no chance. Racing is less fun on days like today."" Meanwhile, Saturday's women's World Cup Super G race at Val d'Isere was called off due to heavy snow at the French resort. Val d'Isere is the traditional host of the start of the main European swing of the World Cup season, having staged men's races last weekend as part of the traditional Criterium de la Premiere Neige (""races of the first snow"").","History repeats as Steve Nyman wins second World Cup race of his career .

"(CNN) -- That the road from revolution to a new Egypt is arduous and twisting comes as no surprise. But few expected that today, one month from presidential elections, Egypt would be moving toward more repression and less accountability than under the deposed dictator Hosni Mubarak. Egypt's crackdown on human-rights organizations, the prosecution and sentencing of the comic actor Adel Imam and the notorious imposition of Article 28, which removes the basic rights of citizens to challenge anything about the upcoming presidential election, create a trifecta of repression. Blood is being spilled on Cairo's streets once again, with up to 20 dead and counting, plus scores wounded by thugs attacking protesters outside the Ministry of Defense. The Supreme Council of Armed Forces (SCAF) is consolidating its power. With the leading human rights organizations -- Freedom House, National Democratic Institute, International Republic Institute, the International Center for Journalists and the Konrad Adenauer Foundation -- facing prosecution, oversight of the elections will be minimal at best. The government is eroding the power of civil society to help build a truly democratic Egypt. Clashes in Egypt turn deadly . And the United States government is complicit in some of these changes for the worse. The United States mistakenly believed that the ""carrot"" of granting SCAF carte blanche -- waiving the human-rights condition to deliver $1.3 billion in military goods -- would more likely ensure cooperation than applying the ""stick"" of withholding military aid. After pocketing the military aid, the Egyptian government allowed Americans under indictment to leave the country. Then it redoubled its persecution of the Egyptians working for human rights NGOs, threatening them with the serious charge of espionage. So far, the assumption that once the Americans were airlifted out of Cairo, the Egyptian employees left behind would be, in the words of Nancy Okail, head of Freedom House's Cairo office, ""forgotten by the international community,"" has proved to be true. ""This sends the wrong message -- that the United States cares only about its own self-interest,"" Okail said in a recent interview in Washington. ""This is about much more than me and my staff; it is a fight for the future of civil society in Egypt. Without civil society, how can you have a healthy transition to democracy?"" Okail's harrowing tales of being held in the ""cage"" in the courtroom in Cairo for five hours, where she read Orwell, and of being led out of the building through a cell full of inmates in a failed attempt to intimidate her indicate that the authorities have every intention of going through with the trial of the Egyptian staff members of the five human rights organizations. Recently making the rounds in Washington, Okail met with universal concern about the fate she and 14 other defendants would face standing trial. No one wants the brave Okail, or her colleagues, to be martyrs, but neither their safety in Egypt nor immunity from being scapegoated can be guaranteed. Unless the Egyptian authorities cannot be persuaded to drop the case, civil society in Egypt will be dealt a serious blow. Two years ago, President Barack Obama uttered these words in Cairo: ""I do have an unyielding belief that all people yearn for certain things: the ability to speak your mind and have a say in how you are governed; confidence in the rule of law and the equal administration of justice; government that is transparent and doesn't steal from the people; the freedom to live as you choose. Those are not just American ideas, they are human rights, and that is why we will support them everywhere."" Now, a revolution and a tumultuous aftermath later, those words ring hollow, as the United States policy of supporting military dictators in Egypt continues unabated. Egyptians feel anxious that the presidential elections will be run under Article 28, part of SCAF's Constitutional Declaration of March 2011. Accordingly, election results issued by the Higher Presidential Election Commission are immutable. In other words, if a citizen observes and even captures on film, electoral fraud, he or she has no right to question the result. As SCAF safeguards its power, hard-line Islamists seek to control Egypt's narrative, tightening the noose around the neck of the Egyptian people. The unthinkable occurred last month when Adel Imam, Egypt's most beloved actor, was convicted of ""insulting Islam"" with his films. Since the Mubarak era, fundamentalists have targeted artists, but the Imam case sets a new standard for censorship. Instead of dismissing the case, as was the custom with past ""offending Islam"" charges, the judge convicted Imam and sentenced him to three months in prison. Imam may win on appeal, but now all Egyptian filmmakers have been put on notice that they may be subjected to the nebulous charge of ""offending Islam."" Add to that the scores who have been convicted for ""crimes"" of expression in films, books and blogs. Egypt's voices, newly energized since the Revolution, are steadily being silenced. Where can ordinary Egyptians look for support? The United States should be their prime defender. With its unconditional support of SCAF, however, the U.S. has forfeited the trust and respect of the Egyptian people. It is not too late for the United States to put the real yearning of the Egyptian people for dignity, justice, opportunity and democracy ahead of the false stability of the Supreme Council of Armed Forces. It is not too late to support the Egyptian people and to demand an end to violence against protesters, protection of NGOs and free, fair and accountable elections. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Cynthia Schneider and Khaled Abol Naga.","Cynthia Schneider, Khaled Abol Naga: Ahead of vote, Egypt moving toward repression again .

"(CNN) -- Saudi Arabia's ambassador to Egypt returned to Cairo on Saturday after tensions briefly spurred the kingdom to pull its envoys and shutter its missions, Saudi state media reported. Ambassador Ahmad Kattan is expected to resume his duties on Sunday, the Saudi Press Agency said. Saudi Arabia called back Kattan and closed its embassy and consulates last Sunday after raucous protests in Cairo over the imprisonment of Ahmed Mohammed el-Gezawi, an Egyptian human rights lawyer. Throngs of Egyptians had gathered in front of the Saudi Embassy, calling for the release of el-Gezawi. The decision to pull out Saudi diplomats came after protesters' ""attempts to storm and threaten the security and safety of its (embassy) employees,"" the Saudi Press Agency said. Saudi officials say el-Gezawi is accused of trying to smuggle thousands of pills into the country. The Egyptian Organization for Human Rights said el-Gezawi had been traveling during Umrah, a minor pilgrimage to Mecca, when he was detained. ""What has happened in the recent days of repercussions in the relationship between the two countries is painful to every honorable Saudi and Egyptian citizen, and our decision to recall the ambassador and the closure of the embassy were only to protect its employees from other situations that could have developed with dire consequences,"" the Saudi Press Agency said, quoting King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz. ""We will not allow this incidental crisis to prolong."" The protests and the Saudi reaction appear to have again ratcheted up long-standing tensions between the two Middle Eastern nations. The strains can be traced to 1979, when the kingdom broke off diplomatic relations after Egypt inked a peace deal with Israel based on the Camp David Accords. The ties were restored in November 1987. Egypt, the most populous Arab country, has often engaged in ""a subtle competition"" with its Saudi counterparts ""over this question of regional leadership,"" said Steven Cook, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. Egypt erupted in protest last year during 18 days of demonstrations in Cairo's Tahrir Square after similar uprisings in neighboring Tunisia, ultimately ousting Egypt's longtime president Hosni Mubarak after nearly three decades in power.","Ambassador Ahmad Kattan is expected to resume his duties Sunday .

"(CNN) -- I wouldn't normally pay much attention to a sports star, even a Fighting Irish hero. But it's more than just a story about a sports star, isn't it? The story of Manti Te'o and his putative online dead girlfriend (may she, or this tale, rest in peace) has a kind of oily vodka shimmer to it that transcends hypothetical naked ambition for the Heisman Trophy and girlfriends with leukemia. I don't know whether any of the story is true; if some shred holds up, my condolences to all involved. But what I note about it is the flash of winking mirrors, the reflections that stand in for authenticated reality. Yes, here I'm going to say ""Mirror, Mirror, on the wall,"" but the mirror really isn't on the wall, but on the desktop or the portable device. Those fine frangible screens, when dropped, can maintain their structure, though stricken with a jag like lightning. The screens are meant to be our windows to the world, but all too often they are only mirrors, reflecting back what we want to see. Not the great and the good, not even the best and the brightest, but merely the brightest. Somewhere in these flashing mirrors, we mistake the flash-lit celebrity, the lightning-strike story, for confirmed reality. We the readers of online news, and we the readers of e-mails, Twitter and favorite blogs do it, too. We've grown used to living without reality coordinates that can be tested not with further keystrokes but with a good swift kick to the tires. We wouldn't buy a car without test-driving it, and we ought not to rely on the flash of mirrors for our take on reality. There is too little focal depth in staring at a mirror. Opinion: Does Te'o story make you laugh or cry? That's what drove Snow White's old Queen mad. She didn't get out enough. She ought to have stopped texting herself and gone to a football game. She ought to have remembered that real news, even real gossip, begins in what is observed firsthand, not secondhand. She would have said, ""Where is this wonderful sick girlfriend?"" If Te'o is not an active agent in some cold-blooded scam, she might have met him in his locker room to tell him what she thought of his lady love, or of her absence in the woods. (Not sent a text message.) As a novelist, I'm a professional liar. It's my job to try to make the improbable seem plausible. My chiefest tool is making readers see themselves in the mirror of the tale. If I can pull that off, they're hooked. Can you picture Manti Te'o getting ready for the showers and being accosted by an old hag with a basket of apples? If you can, even for a moment, I've worked a certain spell, and I've hooked you with my flashing mirror, but I haven't told the truth. Maybe you can only see Manti Te'o trying to wipe the steamy mirror over the locker room sink clear of fog so he can say, ""Who's the best player of us all?"" We should all try wiping away the fog more often. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gregory Maguire.","Gregory Maguire: In the Manti Te'o ""hoax"" story there is the flash of mirrors, not reality .

"Berlin (CNN) -- German chancellor Angela Merkel reshuffled her cabinet Wednesday, moving Interior Minister Thomas de Maziere to the Ministry of Defense and naming parliamentary whip Hans Peter Friedrich head of the Interior Ministry. Merkel made the announcement a day after Defense Secretary Karl Theodor zu Guttenberg resigned amidst a scandal involving alleged plagiarism in his doctoral dissertation.  Guttenberg had been considered a rising star in Merkel's government. Merkel said the moves would be confirmed by Germany's Federal President Christian Wulf on Thursday.  She described de Maziere as a close personal and political friend, and said she believes he will quickly win the support of members of the German armed services. De Maziere ""will see through the reform of the armed forces efficiently and thoroughly,"" Merkel promised. Guttenberg, who had been defense minister since October 2009, said Tuesday he was stepping aside because the controversy surrounding the plagiarism allegation was becoming a distraction. ""When I become the center of attention on the backs of the soldiers who I'm responsible for, then I cannot justify remaining in office,"" he said. ""Because the German army, the academic community, and the parties who back me are in danger of being damaged, I am taking the step that I would expect others to take,"" he concluded. Merkel said Tuesday she had ""accepted Karl-Theodor's resignation with a heavy heart."" Guttenberg, 39, is a member of the Christian Social Union party, which is closely allied with Merkel's Christian Democratic Union.  He studied law and politics in Bayreuth and Munich, according to his official biography. Bayreuth University is investigating whether Guttenberg's alleged plagiarism was intentional, university president Rudiger Bormann said Tuesday.","NEW: Merkel appoints Interior Minister Thomas de Maziere to replace Guttenberg as defense minister .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- A series of explosions rocked the Yemeni port city of Aden ahead of a presidential election Tuesday, but no injuries were reported, security officials said. The blasts took place in separate neighborhoods late Monday, only hours before polls were set to open. In one neighborhood, Mansoora, about five minutes of gunfire accompanied the explosion, but no one was hurt, two security officials confirmed. Security had been tightened in Aden ahead of Tuesday's vote, which features only one candidate, Vice President Abdurabu Mansur Hadi. Hadi took over Yemen's government when longtime President Ali Abdullah Saleh handed over power following a year of unrest, but he insisted on standing for election to make his presidency official. At least 10 new checkpoints had been set up in Aden to bolster security ahead of the vote, and the head of operations for the Supreme Committee for Elections and Referendum said last week that more than 80,000 members of Yemen's security forces would be posted at the 32,000 polling places. Yemen, on the southeastern corner of the Arabian Peninsula, has a population of almost 25 million and has struggled for years with separatist movements.","Explosions are reported in four neighborhoods in Aden .

"(CNN) -- When President Barack Obama addressed the nation the day 20 children were killed in Newtown, Connecticut, he told the nation ""that we are praying for them."" The moment ""Good Morning America"" anchor Robin Roberts announced she had to undergo a bone marrow transplant, many prayers were directed her way. So why is it that sports fans are upset and bothered that Baltimore Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis consistently invokes God and Jesus, and recites Bible scriptures? We saw a lot of criticism toward Tim Tebow for the same thing. Criticize him aplenty for not being able to throw the football, but hating on him because of his faith? Please, sit down. Amid 'storybook' ending, Ray Lewis is still controversial . Olympian Lolo Jones was on ESPN's ""First Take"" Friday and she said that it's interesting that someone else will get more positive attention for releasing a sex tape while she is ridiculed for saying she'll remain a virgin until she gets married. I'll be honest, a lot of the criticism comes from individuals in the media who see religious people as weird and kooks. No, not all members of the media, but I can say in my experience as a reporter for 21 years that I have heard a lot of anti-religious, and especially anti-Christian, stuff from my media brothers and sisters. In individual discussions working at newspapers, radio stations, TV and online outlets, folks have ridiculed the religious for having convictions that don't line up with others' political beliefs. Yet what is so funny is that when those same individuals encountered a health crisis, had marital problems or issues with their children or were about to lose their job, they were the first ones to seek the Bible believer out for prayer. This really shouldn't come as a shock, because that's how a lot of Americans are. When we don't think we need to have a relationship with God, we'll blow off praying or going to church. Just let the good times roll, huh? But just wait until something bad happens. Man, we'll flock to the nearest church, mosque or synagogue; break out the prayer beads; and blow the dust off of the Bible in order to be comforted. Remember the night of September 11, 2001? You would have been hard-pressed to find a seat in a house of worship. We were a prayer nation on that day, when nearly 3,000 of our brothers and sisters were killed in terrorist attacks. It doesn't bother me one bit to see an athlete choose to be public with their faith. God bless 'em. And if another player makes the decision to not be as public, God bless them, too. The ridicule with being a strong person of faith comes with the territory. Heck, if Jesus was mocked in his day, it's no shock Ray Lewis, Tim Tebow or anyone else today will be ridiculed. But the key is to remain steadfast and strong. Jesus told his followers in Matthew 28:19 to ""Go therefore and make disciples of all nations."" Opinion: Who is God backing in the Super Bowl? Now before there was a Ray Lewis, there was a Reggie White. Just like Ray, Reggie was trashed for his religious convictions. He was told to just shut up and play football. But if God gave Reggie the gifts to do what he did, why not give Him the glory? As a devout Christian, I will not bend, and will stand strong in the faith when it comes to my religious convictions. Afraid to say Jesus on TV? Nope. In fact, the first four specials I hosted on CNN in 2007 were all religious specials. We may lose jobs, money, fame and public glory, but as long as my relationship with God stays intact, I'm not bothered by the haters. Does God want the Ravens to beat the 49ers because of Ray Lewis? No. Are you betting on the Ravens because you think Ray plays on Team Jesus? You better recognize that God is no bookie. We can all appreciate every player for what they bring to the table, and if they are believers in the faith, then God bless them. Win or lose. Ray Lewis and other players of faith have a tremendous platform. More than 100 million people will probably be watching on Sunday. If someone makes a decision to accept Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior because they were inspired by Ray Lewis exhortation of his faith on Super Bowl Sunday, great. If someone just wants to watch the game, no problem. But I will be thankful that a man who is undaunted by his critics will be unapologetic in professing his faith. Ray Lewis has faced the depths of evil in his past, and like Saul he went through his own Damascus Road Experience and has been transformed. No matter the faith or the occupation, there is nothing wrong with emerging from darkness and becoming a shining bright light. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland Martin.","Roland Martin: Why do people criticize Ray Lewis for invoking God?
Martin: It's because some individuals in the media see religious people as weird .
He says but if something bad happens, those same people in the media will seek God too .

"(CNN) -- Gabrielle ""Gabby"" Giffords stood next to her husband in court Thursday as he spoke directly to Jared Loughner, the Arizona man who tried to assassinate the then-congresswoman in a January 2011 shooting. ""Mr. Loughner, you may have put a bullet through her head, but you haven't put a dent in her spirit and her commitment to make the world a better place,"" former astronaut Mark Kelly said. Giffords was seriously wounded when Loughner walked up and shot her in the head during her meet-and-greet event with constituents outside a Tucson grocery store on January 8, 2011. A federal judge, a congressional aide and four others were killed and 12 other people suffered wounds. U.S. District Judge Larry Burns sentenced Loughner to serve the rest of his life in prison without the possibility of parole. The punishment includes seven consecutive life terms plus 140 years. ""The evidence clearly shows that he knew what he was doing, despite his mental illness,"" the judge said. Loughner, 24, spoke just once, confirming to the judge that he would make no statement before sentencing. ""That is true,"" he said. Giffords shooting survivors seek federal help in tightening gun laws . Beside the dramatic appearance by Giffords and her husband, nine other victims spoke at the sentencing hearing held in a packed federal courtroom in Tuscon. Kelly, in an interview Thursday evening with CNN's Piers Morgan, said hearing what they had to say ""was really a tough thing"" for Giffords. ""Gabby said afterwards, for her the biggest emotion was just sadness,"" Kelly said. ""To hear story after story of what the impact of this horrible day had on people was really difficult."" Much of the time, those words were directed toward the 24-year-old Loughner, whose lawyer stroked his arm at times. ""You pointed a weapon at me and shot me,"" said Susan Hileman, who was wounded by Loughner's Glock pistol. ""Over last several months, I wanted to take you by the shoulders and shake you and scream at you."" ""It's an awful situation,"" she said, looking straight at Loughner, ""and it's all because of you."" His victims gathered that day ""to witness democracy in action,"" she said. ""We brought family and friends. You brought a gun."" Mavanell Stoddard described how her ""precious husband,"" Dorwin Stoddard, was fatally shot as he fell on top of her to shield her from the onslaught of bullets. ""Somehow when you shot him, I got out from under him,"" Stoddard said. ""I was screaming 'Oh God, oh God, help me.' I said to him 'breathe deeply,' and he did. Therefore, I believe that he heard me said 'I love you.' "" He died in her arms her minutes later, she said. ""Then I passed out because you had shot me three times,"" she said. ""You took away my life, my love, my reason for living."" ""I am so lonesome,"" Stoddard said as she stared directly at Loughner. ""I hate living without him. No one to hold me, no one to love me, no one to talk to, no one to care. I forgive you. As a Christian, I am required to."" Giffords leads crowd in pledge at vigil marking 1 year since shooting . Mary Reed, who was among the wounded, blamed Loughner for introducing ""my children to something sinister and evil."" ""My children will forever remember the moments of people when they died, the smell of blood everywhere,"" Reed said. ""Jared took their lives, their bodies, but he will not take their spirit,"" victim Pat Maisch said. Pamela Simon, one of the Giffords congressional aides who was wounded, said Loughner is reminder ""of our society's failure to provide adequate mental health."" ""Jared, I know you did not choose this illness that led to this horrific tragedy,"" Simon said. ""When you were a student in middle school, and I was a teacher there at the same time. You were a regular kid."" U.S. Rep. Ron Barber also spoke. ""The physical and mental wounds will be with us forever,"" said Barber, who was hit in the leg by a bullet. He spoke of watching congressional aide Gabe Zimmerman -- ""one of my dearest colleagues"" -- die. ""He was my go-to guy, a human being with so much compassion,"" Barber said. Barber won a special election to fill Giffords' congressional seat after she stepped down a year after the shooting. ""We are thankful she survived your attempt to take her life,"" Barber told Loughner. ""You did not take away her compassion and desire to serve. In fact, the whole world knows of this great leader. She remains the model of bipartisanship and political courage."" Barber told the court he supports a life sentence for Loughner. ""I hold no hatred for you, but I am very angry and sick at heart about what you have done and the hurt you have caused all of us,"" Barber told Loughner. ""You now must bear this burden and never again see the outside of a prison."" 19 months after mass shooting, Giffords moves back to Tucson . Mark Kelly, who was training for a space shuttle mission when he learned his wife was shot, spoke for her as she watched. ""Gabby would trade her own life to bring back any one of those you savagely murdered on that day,"" he said. The statement noted each of the dead. ""And then there is what you took from Gabby,"" Kelly said, looking at Loughner. ""Her life has been forever changed. Plans she had for our family and her career have been immeasurably altered. Every day is a continuous struggle to do those things she was once so very good at. His wife now struggles to walk, an arm is paralyzed and she is partially blind, he said. She stepped down from her position in Congress in January 2012 to focus on her recovery. ""Mr. Loughner, by making death and producing tragedy, you sought to extinguish the beauty of life,"" Kelly said. ""To diminish potential. To strain love. And to cancel ideas. You tried to create for all of us a world as dark and evil as your own. But know this, and remember it always: You failed."" Directing his comments away from Loughner for a moment, Kelly said ""There's something else Gabby and I have been spending a lot of time thinking about. "" ""The way we conduct politics must change,"" he said. ""Sure, it's easier to win a debate if you can turn your opponent into a demon, but that's not how we move forward. Not only does slash-and-burn politics make Americans cynical about their leaders, but it leads to bad ideas. It creates problems instead of solving the ones we have now. Kelly concluded with words directed again at the defendant. ""Mr. Loughner, pay close attention to this: Though you are mentally ill, you are responsible for the death and hurt you inflicted upon all of us on January 8th of last year,"" he said. You know this. Gabby and I know this. Everyone in this courtroom knows this. You have decades upon decades to contemplate what you did. But after today. After this moment. Here and now. Gabby and I are done thinking about you."" He pleaded guilty to 19 charges in exchange for the life sentence to avoid facing the death penalty. He had been facing more than 50 federal charges. ""Mr. Loughner, you have been given a gift, whether you know it or not,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Wallace Kleindienst said, just before recommending a life sentence. ""Almost all the victims you shot and the families of those you killed came to us and said they didn't want us to seek the death penalty in this case."" Under the pleas, Loughner admitted guilt in the wounding of Giffords and the murders of federal employees U.S. District Court Chief Judge John M. Roll, 63, and congressional aide Gabriel M. Zimmerman, 30, prosecutors said. Loughner also pleaded guilty to the attempted murders of federal employees and congressional aides Ronald S. Barber, 65, and Pamela K. Simon, 63, prosecutors said. Loughner also admitted causing the deaths of Christina-Taylor Green, 9; Dorothy ""Dot"" J. Morris, 76; Phyllis C. Schneck, 79; and Dorwan C. Stoddard, 76, prosecutors said. Prosecutors said Loughner admitted injuring with a Glock pistol 10 people participating at an activity provided by the U.S. government and creating a grave risk of death to 13 more people. Prosecutors agreed to the plea deal after taking into account Loughner's history of mental illness and the views of victims and their families.

"Cairo (CNN) -- Outside Egypt's top court in Cairo, protest leader Hussein Abdel Rahman wears a sash around his collared shirt emblazoned with a zucchini. The judiciary, he says, has transformed into what the green vegetable means in colloquial language: corruption, nepotism, favoritism. An editorial cartoon in a Cairo daily sums up Egypt's state of affairs: a scribbled mess of spirals. And the presidential election this weekend, once hailed as Egypt's big step toward democracy, is now satirized in an online mock-up of a video game pitting a bare-chested Ahmed Shafik, the last prime minister under ousted President Hosni Mubarak, against the bearded Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood. The runoff vote is taking place after the Supreme Constitutional Court declared the parliament invalid and triggered renewed chaos over the country's leadership. The ruling dealt a blow to the Muslim Brotherhood, which dominated parliament, and was victory for supporters of Shafik, the focus of protesters' derision for his ties to the deposed dictator. Anger festered Friday among those who feared that a hard-won revolution was fast unraveling; that little had changed. Rankled revolutionaries felt left out in the cold on a hot June day. The dissolution of parliament gives the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, or SCAF, full legislative and executive power alongside, it appears, a friendly judiciary. ""SCAF has been suppressing our protests, suppressing the youth movements on the ground,"" said Wisam Mohamed. ""They have been arresting thousands of us."" Ahmed Maher, a founder of the April 6 Youth Movement, which played a prominent role in last year's Tahrir Square uprising, called the ruling ""provocative."" The contentious verdict, he told the English language news website Ahram Online, will ""pave the way for the reanimation of the ousted Mubarak regime."" The court dissolved parliament after it had been in session for a little more that four months, saying that constitutional articles that regulated the parliamentary elections were invalid. SCAF, which has been in control of the country since Mubarak's ouster, claimed full legislative power. Many view the move as a ""soft coup"" staged by Egypt's powerful military, a move intended to diminish the power of the Islamists, who have long been held under the military's microscope. The court ruling was ""a complete coup d'etat through which the military council is writing off the most noble stage in the nation's history,"" said Mohamed el-Beltagy, a senior member of the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party. Sally Toma, a member of the Revolution Youth Coalition, blamed the Islamists for what happened. ""The parliament only served the Islamists, who dominated it,"" she told Ahram. She said the Brotherhood stood against the idea of creating a presidential council mandated with powers of administration until a new constitution could be drawn up. ""Legislative powers have been transferred to the SCAF because of the Brotherhoods' selfishness,"" she said. ""They made us lose the revolution, and they lost everything."" After the ruling, speculation rose that Morsi, the Brotherhood's candidate, would pull out now that his party's pillar of power had crumbled. But Morsi said he will stay in the running, though the notion of carrying on a vote under the circumstances seemed absurd to some. In the absence of a parliament, the winner of the runoff vote will be put in a position of dealing directly with Egypt's military leaders, a reason for SCAF to postpone the elections, said Mohamed ElBaradei, a 2005 Nobel Peace Prize laureate whose own presidential bid failed. ""Electing president in the absence of constitution and parliament is electing an 'emperor' with more powers than deposed dictator. A travesty,"" he tweeted Friday. Gamal Mahmoud hoped the election process would proceed peacefully. ""And I hope that the voter chooses the person who will achieve the goals of the revolution,"" he said. The streets of Cairo were calm early Friday, but everyone braced for Tahrir Square to erupt with anger. Already, protesters were amassing in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria. The April 6 Movement took to Facebook to motivate protesters. ""We are now back at the crossroads and perhaps at the point of zero. Martial law under the disguise of legality,"" it said. ""The Muslim Brotherhood proved beyond a reasonable doubt that they are incapable of understanding history, refuse to learn from their mistakes, and have a level of arrogance that makes them unable to accept advice."" The unease was palpable on Twitter as well. ""So now we have a country with no constitution, no parliament, no president. And military police in checkpoints and around parliament! Ummm,"" wrote @TheBigPharaoh. Wael Ghonim, the former Google executive who attained fame after being arrested during the uprising, said: ""The only thing that will make us go back to living in fear, oppression and silence is a time machine -- they haven't invented that yet."" Many Egyptians, emboldened to speak their minds now more than ever, felt alienated by both the Muslim Brotherhood and their other choice: a remnant of the old regime. ""Both choices are unacceptable to me,"" said Ahmed Maher, a civil servant. ""I will be boycotting."" University student Ibrahim Gamal Al-Din has become an online sensation with his satirical music videos. In one, he takes aim at the Muslim Brotherhood. ""This is our country, but you were all sleeping,"" he sings. ""We took parliament and the constitutional assembly, and we'll take the presidency, too. And if you don't like it, you can go to hell."" Humor has long been a form of dissent in Egypt, Ibrahim says. Whenever things get tense, he says, Egyptians try to cope by making fun. But the rumblings Friday were not all funny. It was clear many Egyptians had had enough. Wait until the sun goes down, tweeted an activist. The small gathering at Tahrir will get stronger. But by the time evening came, the air filled with uncertainty, though not much had transpired in the iconic square. CNN's Ben Wedeman reported from Cairo and Moni Basu from Atlanta.

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Embattled Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh was en route to the United States for medical treatment Sunday, officials said. Saleh arrived in Oman earlier and was on his way to America, Vice President Abdurabu Hadi said. ""The president will travel back to Yemen in February to attend the swearing-in ceremony of the newly elected president,"" the Yemeni Embassy in Washington said. The purpose of his U.S. trip is a ""private medical visit,"" it added. At least six family members were with Saleh, two senior Yemeni government officials said. Yemeni state television reported earlier Sunday that Saleh had announced he was going to the United States for treatment. Saleh was wounded in a June bomb attack on his presidential palace. The U.S. State Department said Sunday that his request to travel to the United States had been approved. ""As we have indicated, the sole purpose of this travel is for medical treatment and we expect that he will stay for a limited time that corresponds to the duration of this treatment,"" the department said in a statement. Yemeni President Saleh granted immunity . Saleh's departure came a day after Yemen's parliament approved a controversial law giving the president complete immunity from prosecution. In return, Saleh will step down from power in Yemen next month after ruling the country for more than 33 years. Protesters have demonstrated for months in Yemen, calling for Saleh to step down. In a speech broadcast on Yemeni state television Sunday, Saleh apologized to his people. ""I ask for forgiveness from my fellow citizens, men and women, for any negligence during my presidential term in the last 33 years, I ask for forgiveness and I apologize to all Yemeni citizens,"" he said. He called for protesters to stop demonstrations. ""Young men, go back to your homes, go to your families. I feel sorry for you, I call on you to go back to your homes and start a new page with the new leadership,"" he said. Word that Saleh was leaving the country did not quell protesters' criticisms there. ""If Saleh thinks that because he left the country we will head back home then he is wrong. We left our homes demanding complete change and will not go back until we reach our goal. The Yemeni revolution is for real,"" said Saba al-Shibami, a youth activist in Sanaa. She was among thousands of protesters in Sanaa's Change Square vowing to continue demonstrations until Saleh is prosecuted for alleged human rights violations, including the deaths of protesters. Demonstrations in 14 Yemeni provinces Sunday protested the immunity deal, activists said. The immunity law was a key element in the Gulf Cooperation Council power transfer deal Saleh signed in November. Though the deal was hailed by opposition parties in Yemen, youth protesters and international rights groups called the immunity a violation of international law. Protesters Sunday chanted ""No immunity will save you. Justice will prevail"" and ""Saleh, Saleh, wait and see, your future will be painful."" Demonstrators also criticized opposition leaders, claiming that they had sold out the country. ""Who are they to grant Saleh immunity? The opposition are not the ones who lost loved ones. They have no authority to grant a killer immunity,"" said Ali Shajerah, a youth activist in Sanaa. Opposition parties defended their stance, saying it was necessary and for the best of interest of Yemen. ""The immunity was important and it makes Yemen a safer country. Let us help Vice President Abdurabu Hadi build this nation,"" said Mohammed Abulahoum, the president of the opposition Justice and Building party. He said a revolution was continuing in Yemen. ""Yemen needs a new direction and for this to happen, Saleh had to leave."" Saleh said he would return to Sanaa as the president of his party, the General People's Congress, according to state television. Senior ruling party officials said that Saleh would be back in less than a month to support Hadi's presidential nomination. ""When Obama leaves the U.S., Americans do not say that he will not be back. The same thing with President Saleh. He will be back to Yemen and will lead the General People's Congress party,"" said Mohammed Shaef, a senior GPC official and tribal chief of Bakeel, the country's largest tribe.

"(CNN) -- A militant attack on a government vehicle in Yemen's business capital, Aden, Wednesday, killed a political security officer and injured seven others, three senior security officials said. The incident happened as the intelligence officers were heading to work. The injured were taken to a government hospital. Eyewitnesses told CNN that heavy artillery was used in the attack. Security officials blamed al Qaeda. ""This is not the first time intelligence officers were attacked in Aden,"" said a senior security official who is not authorized to talk to media. ""At least 34 have been killed or injured since last September."" A dozen such attacks have taken place in Aden over the last six months, he said. ""We believe that at least four militants were involved in the attack,"" the official said. ""The government will not give additional details before the investigation is complete."" Large explosions were heard in Aden earlier in the day, however no casualties were reported. Political experts have long doubted that al Qaeda is behind the attacks despite the government claims, and instead believe that members of the old regime are to blame. ""The government has been practicing a dangerous tactic by weakening the political security because its loyalty is not to the ruling family,"" said Abdul Salam Mohammed, Chairman of Abaad Strategic Center. ""These attacks were expected and many others will follow."" Ansaar al-Sharia, an extremist militant group in neighboring Abyan province, has been clashing with government troops for nine months.

"Cairo (CNN) -- Hussein Gomaa Hussein was only 31 when he died. It was 2 in the afternoon on a late January day. A bullet pierced his chest as he protested the regime of Hosni Mubarak on the streets of Cairo. Hussein's brother Mohamed has no doubts as to Mubarak's complicity. He wishes the harshest punishment for the longtime Egyptian dictator when a trial verdict is pronounced Saturday. Execution. That is the only sentence that will satisfy the families of all those who died or were injured in Egypt's revolution last year, Hussein says. ""That is the only verdict we will accept."" In what Egyptians have dubbed the trial of the century, Mubarak will face a judge Saturday to find out his fate in a long-awaited decision that is sure to make a definitive mark on the Arab nation's future. Gallery: Arab leaders -- where are they now? The verdict comes after a notorious emergency law expired Friday, ending 31 years of sweeping police powers. And it comes ahead of a polarizing mid-June runoff in the presidential election that pits the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohamed Morsi against the more secularist Ahmed Shafiq, a former official in Mubarak's regime. Mubarak could receive the death penalty. Or a prison term. Or be acquitted altogether. The latter could send angry crowds back to Cairo's Tahrir Square and deal a heavy blow to Egypt's unfinished revolution. The last days of Mubarak's regime . Mubarak became president in October 1981, ruling Egypt with an iron hand as a staunch ally of the United States. But all those years in power were shattered by 18 days of uprising. On February 11 of last year, he stood down, defeated by popular will. He was charged with corruption, misappropriation of funds and, most seriously, issuing orders to kill demonstrators calling for the downfall of his regime. About 840 people died and more than 6,000 others were wounded in the Egyptian uprising, according to Amnesty International. ""As president, Mubarak was responsible for protecting all Egyptian citizens,"" said prosecutor Mustafa Suleiman. ""He didn't take the appropriate measures to carry out his duty to stop the bloodshed and the acts of violence against the Egyptian people."" Also on trial were Mubarak's two sons and other members of his regime. Mubarak was the first former Arab head of state in many decades to appear in an ordinary court of law. Tunisia's Zine el Abidine Ben Ali was tried in absentia. Mubarak's trial, said Human Rights Watch, has the potential to set a meaningful regional precedent for accountability for human rights abuses and for upholding international fair trial standards. When the trial opened, it was a spectacle few Egyptians thought they would ever see. Images broadcast around the world showed the former leader in a defendant's cage, trapped like an animal. January 2012: Mubarak arrives at court via stretcher . Within a matter of six months, he had fallen from the pinnacle of power to the depths of humiliation. The trial proceeded in chaotic manner. Outside the heavily guarded court, Mubarak's foes clashed with loyalists. Magdi Fouda is one such loyalist; he leads a group of Mubarak supporters. He said he hopes the court finds the former president innocent Saturday. Fouda collected 750,000 signatures on a petition calling for Mubarak's pardon. Others have set up a Facebook page called ""Sorry, Mr President,"" which boasts more than 240,000 ""likes."" When Mubarak's trial began in August . The ousted leader should be honored, not humiliated, for his decades of work for Egypt, Fouda said. ""We believe President Mubarak has been terribly mistreated recently,"" he said. ""We will stand faithfully by him, to honor him for his 62 years of service to Egypt. Lawyer Khalid Abu Bakr attended every session of the trial, representing some of the families of those killed in the uprising. ""I am proud of the transparency and objectivity of this historical trial regardless of the verdict,"" he said in February. ""It has met all the standards of judicial due process in comparison with court proceedings in Europe and the United States of America."" Now, on the eve of the verdict, Bakr said the ailing Mubarak maintained a certain regal disdain for the proceedings, spending much of his time on a mobile bed, his hair jet black, odd on a man well into his 80s. Never did he show regret, Bakr said. No words of remorse ever left his lips, though some expected him to say he was sorry for the blood that was spilled. Or perhaps, that he made a mistake. For journalist Mona Eltahawy, Mubarak's trial is not about revenge. It's about justice in a land where the courts and legal system have been rife with corruption. To hope for justice to prevail is very difficult for Egyptians, she said, pointing out that members of the police and security forces have never been put on trial. ""Egyptians are very angry,"" she said. Still, people protested non-violently on the streets last year. They achieved what was the unthinkable -- they toppled Mubarak. Whatever happens Saturday, Eltahawy said, Egyptians will oppose injustice. Peacefully.

"(CNN) -- Dozens of soldiers loyal to Yemen's former president face charges of trying to take over the Ministry of Defense in an attack that left five people dead and 16 wounded, a military official said Thursday. Sixty-two members of the Republican Guard will stand trial for their alleged roles in Tuesday's assault on the ministry in the capital city of Sanaa, said Gen. Ali al-Obaidi of the High Security Committee. ""Political motives of certain factions in Yemen are behind the attack,"" he said. It was the latest attack in recent months by forces loyal Ali Abdullah Saleh, who stepped down in February after protesters took to the streets in mass demonstrations calling for his ouster. Officials accused the former commander of Yemen's air force -- a relative of Saleh who was ousted in a military shakeup -- of leading an assault in April on the country's main airport. That was followed weeks later by an attack on the Ministry of Interior. The soldiers arrested this week were among roughly 200 loyal to Saleh's son, who was head of the Republican Guard, according to al-Obaidi. Dozens more soldiers believed to have participated in the attack were under investigation, he said. The Republican Guard, meanwhile, denied its soldiers were involved, saying the attack was conducted by troops not under its command. The attack follows a restructuring of Yemen's security forces, which was insisted upon by the new president, Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi, as part of the negotiated deal that saw Saleh given immunity from prosecution in exchange for stepping down from office. In the wake of the attack on the ministry, a weapons ban was implemented across the city with only those participating in government missions allowed to carry guns. The unrest in Yemen began in 2011 as the population got caught up in the Arab Spring uprisings that swept North Africa and the Middle East. Protesters called for an end to Saleh's 33-year rule.","Yemen has charged 62 soldiers in the attack on the defense ministry, an official says .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Two American tourists who were kidnapped early Thursday in Egypt's Sinai region have been released unharmed, a U.S. State Department spokesman said, citing Egyptian officials. The U.S. Embassy has contacted the victims' relatives and is providing consular assistance, State Department deputy spokesman Mark Toner said. The confirmation of their release came shortly after one of the men, Brandon Kutz, contradicted a statement by Gen. Ahmed Fawzi, secretary for the governor of South Sinai, who had told CNN the two men had been released and were on their way to a hotel with Egyptian security forces. Fawzi said a deal had been reached with the kidnappers. But Kutz told CNN that, though they were being treated ""extremely well,"" the two were still in the custody of their captors. A few hours later, Toner confirmed their release. Opinion: Promise of Arab Spring eluding Egypt? The gunmen who kidnapped the two tourists Thursday morning had demanded the release of a man arrested a day earlier for drug possession, authorities said. It was not clear if the man was released as part of a deal to secure the Americans' freedom. The tourists, both 31, were in a car Thursday morning headed to a hotel from the town of Dahab when they were stopped, the state-run Ahram newspaper said. The gunmen forced the tourists from the car and took them away, demanding the release of a man named Eid Suleiman Etaiwy, the newspaper said. Etaiwy had been arrested Wednesday in possession of ""a large amount of drugs,"" the report said. Marwan Mustapha, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, said government and intelligence officials negotiated with the kidnappers over the tourists' release. Kidnappings and armed robberies have increased during the year since Egypt's long-ruling dictator, Hosni Mubarak, was overthrown. Days before Mubarak verdict, sons charged with insider trading . The Sinai is one of the most underdeveloped areas in the country, and Bedouins have long complained that government services are nonexistent. In February, two other American tourists were briefly kidnapped in the region. The kidnappers demanded that some detainees be released, but it is unclear whether the demands were met. In January, 24 Chinese workers and a translator were kidnapped while on their way to a military-owned cement factory. A group of armed Bedouins had blocked the road they were traveling and wanted the Egyptian government to release prisoners. The hostages were released a day after Egyptian authorities intervened, China's state-run Xinhua news agency said.

"(CNN) -- Loose airline seats. Flights that are delayed or canceled. The shifting blame game of who's responsible for American Airlines' ever-growing problems. At the end of the day, travelers want to get from Point A to Point B safely and on time. They don't want to worry that their seats might come loose or that management and labor can't seem to get along. American Airlines and any other company that can't fulfill its core mission on a regular basis, whether it's safe and efficient airline travel or safe peanut butter or cynanide-free Tylenol, may not be long for this world. Clumsy fliers spilling Diet Coke and coffee on plane floors and seats, causing ""gunked-up"" seat-locking mechanisms, hardly seem to constitute a root cause. American Airlines says spilled soda, coffee helped cause sticky moments . ""These are solvable problems,""says Harvard Business School professor Rosabeth Moss Kanter, who wrote about the mid-1990s turnaround of Continental Airlines in ""Confidence: How Winning Streaks and Losing Streaks Begin and End."" 11 witty and sage airline 'gunk' retorts . ""You have to take the right operational and strategic moves. You have to rebuild confidence. But it's by acting very quickly, not by a nice note to customers."" Troubled companies can be turned around, says Kanter, if executives take specific steps to address their problems and move forward. Add your own suggestions for how American Airlines can keep or earn your business in the comments below. Admit what's broken and fix it . There's no doubt that American is having problems with its seats. However, Kanter says that's probably just the most obvious problem. ""The company needs to admit the facts publicly, put them on the table fully and take responsibility at the very highest levels of the company,"" she says. And it's probably not just the seats. ""This is a quality failure of a massive kind and has to signal other quality problems,"" she says. ""The situation is always worse than you think. There are a lot of other things that have deteriorated that you don't know about. You have to be digging deeper because I bet there have to be other things going on."" Who still wants to fly American? Turn to employees for solutions . Any solutions must include pilots, flight attendants and mechanics, says Kanter. It's often the front-line employees who really understand what's wrong and can brainstorm the solutions to these problems. It may be too hard to get current management to turn to employees for solutions, when employees are rightly or wrong being blamed for so many of the problems. ""These antagonisms have been building for many years,"" says Kanter. ""In a turnaround, it's management that has to change because they'll never regain the trust of employees."" Spend money on the core business . With limited money to spend, ""the airline must shift investment away from things that are not directly related to passenger and (front-line) employee experience,"" says Kanter. ""If that means some corporate staff need to have smaller departments, so be it. They should immediately shift company resources to people delivering the product and those experiencing it."" You need happy front line employees to deliver a good product to your customers, she says. And in the case of an airline, that product needs to be safe. ""Every day people are deciding whether or not to board that plane and every day they can make different choices. The American board and top management need to take this incredibly seriously."" Many of you fly American Airlines frequently. What would you tell American or any airline to do to keep your business? What basic requirements do you have?

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Yemen formed a new unity government, the latest step in the implementing of the pact leading to the controversial president's departure from office, the state news agency said on Wednesday . Yemeni Vice President Abdu Rabo Mansour Hadi issued a decree forming the government and 35 ministers were named. The prime minister is Mohammed Basindwa and Abu Bakr Al-Qirbi remains the country's foreign minister. Youth revolution activists, who've been leading the protests to remove President Ali Abdullah Saleh, greeted the move cynically. It is part of a deal devised by the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, comprising Gulf Arab states and signed on November 24. Saleh stepped down after he agreed to the plan, which calls for transferring power in exchange for immunity from prosecution. It allows Saleh to retain the title of president for three months, until elections are held, but it required him to hand over executive powers to Hadi. Yemen has been greatly affected by the ferment across the Arab world this year. The government had been engulfed by nationwide protests against his regime and fighting between security forces and his foes. An ally in the Western fight against terror groups, the government has been battling an al Qaeda affiliate. As for the GCC deal, many protesters, like Abdul Rabb al-Murthada, dislike it and regard it as illegal. ""The government only represents itself and not the Yemeni people,"" he said. ""It will fail and the youth will continue until a complete revolution is seen in Yemen."" Another protester, Salem al-Shuaib, urged citizens to reject any deal that gives Saleh immunity. ""No government or agreement can save the ruling family from the crimes they committed,"" said al-Shuaib . On Sunday, Hadi announced the formation of a military council of 14 members whose duties will be to stabilize the country and reform the military, a senior official in the vice president's office told CNN. They are evenly divided between the ruling party and the opposition, with each side receiving seven seats in the council. Tareq Shami, the media officer of the ruling General People Congress party, told CNN that all sides are optimistic that this council will help in solving the security situation in the country. ""This is a good step and we support it. This will help in getting the gunmen out of the streets in Yemen and make the country safer,"" said Shami. The power-transfer deal states that the military council should be formed within five days of the signing of that agreement while the new government was to be announced within 14 days. But heavy clashes raged in northern Sanaa between government forces and opposition fighters loyal to the Ahmar clan in Hasaba district. The clashes were the first in Sanaa since the vice president assumed presidential duties. The Ahmar media office told CNN one civilian was killed and four others were injured as blasts reverberated across the city, stoking fear of persistent fighting. Eyewitnesses told CNN that Republican Guards attacked the residential compounds of the Ahmars for more than six hours Wednesday morning and that resulted in clashes. There has been ""escalating violence"" in the southwestern city of Taiz, the International Committee of the Red Cross said, and the group ""is deeply alarmed."" ""There are worrying reports of injured people being unable to reach medical facilities, and of facilities being attacked and damaged,"" said Eric Marclay, the ICRC's head of delegation in Yemen. ""The violence has had a serious impact on basic services in recent weeks, with life-saving medical services especially hard hit. The escalating violence on the streets of Taiz has left dozens dead or wounded."" Yemen Red Crescent volunteers and others transporting casualties have been stopped from saving lives or have been injured , the ICRC said. ICRC surgeons and local doctors have been working to treat victims. ""Trying to save a life can cost you your own these days,"" Marclay said. ""Anyone who is injured must be able to receive life-saving medical care without delay. Access to health care infrastructure must not be arbitrarily denied or limited. It is essential that medical staff, vehicles and facilities be protected and respected,"" he added. Hospitals must not be attacked. Saleh became the fourth leader to leave office as a result of the Arab Spring unrest that has roiled much of the Middle East and North Africa this year. The others have been Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, and Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. The new Minister of Human Rights Hooria Mashhour said there's a lot of work to be done to heal and stabilize the country. ""Our youth are still in the square,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- A French Red Cross official abducted by militants in Yemen has been freed, according to a statement from the International Committee of the Red Cross. Benjamin Malbrancke had been kidnapped the evening of April 21 about 30 kilometers outside the western municipality of Hodeida, while traveling in a Red Cross vehicle. ""We are relieved and extremely happy to have our colleague back with us, in good health. His return marks the end of many long, hard days, full of anxiety for him and his family, as well as for the team here in Yemen and for his friends,"" said Eric Marclay, who heads the ICRC operations in Yemen. ""We would like to express our deep gratitude to all those who have lent us their support during these long weeks, so that Benjamin can now look forward to soon rejoining his family."" Malbrancke had been traveling with two Yemeni drivers, who were also taken but then released unharmed. Kidnappings are common in Yemen, which has been beset by political turbulence for more than a year. Protests led to the departure of President Ali Abdullah Saleh from office, and the government has battled Islamic militants.","A French Red Cross official abducted by militants in Yemen has been freed, the ICRC says .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Yemen's former president says he will not leave his country unless his political, tribal, and military foes leave as well, a senior aide to the ex-president told CNN Thursday. Former President Ali Abdullah Saleh said the condition was agreed to in a secret deal struck last May at the residence of Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi, who was recently elected as the new president of Yemen, said the aide, who asked not to be named. Saleh named Gen. Ali Mohsen, military commander of the country's northern and eastern regions, as the first on the list of officials who must leave the country. Others include four brothers from the prominent Ahmar family who were involved in a fierce war against Saleh's forces last May before the president was seriously wounded and burned in an assassination attempt at the presidential palace amid battles between government forces and tribal fighters. Saleh's demands that his enemies depart Yemen come as tens of thousands of youth activists protested this week, demanding that Saleh be prosecuted. The unrest in Yemen began in 2011 as the population got caught up in the Arab Spring uprisings that swept North Africa and the Middle East. Protesters called for an end to Saleh's 33-year rule. Abdu Ganadi, the spokesman for Saleh's ruling General People Congress party (GPC), said that Saleh's stance does not represent the official position of the party, but is a condition that Saleh has put on the table in exchange for him leaving the country. ""With the attendance of the U.S. ambassador in Yemen, the opposition officials promised to leave the country if Saleh left,"" Ganadi told CNN. Saleh said Yemen cannot restore stability and security as long as the elements of the one-year political impasse stay in the country. A deal for Saleh to leave power, brokered by the Gulf Cooperation Council in Saudi Arabia in November, did not include such a stipulation. After several weeks of maneuvering, Saleh finally signed the GCC power transfer agreement in exchange for immunity from prosecution. Saleh is currently the president of the GPC party and since stepping down from power has provoked the anger of the country's opposition with continuous involvement in the political scene. ""The opposition will not be involved in any national dialogue if Saleh is atop of the GPC. The country revolted against him so it is impossible to involve him in any dialogue,"" said Mohammed Qahtan, former spokesman for the opposition Joint Meeting Parties. ""He stands behind the killing of innocent Yemenis and the revolution is incomplete if he remains in the political picture,"" Qahtan said. Saleh's relatives still hold key military and governmental posts with more than 180,000 troops under their command. Asked about the report of a secret deal, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said on Thursday she ""can't speak to"" Saleh's ""political future in Yemen."" As long as Saleh respects ""the process that the Yemeni people have endorsed and that is ongoing, we don't have a view one way or the other about whether he stays in the country,"" she said. ""We want to see him play a constructive role in supporting the democratization process in Yemen,"" Nuland said. Yemen is the poorest country in the Middle East, with a severe shortage of water and rising levels of malnutrition among its population of about 25 million. Before he left office, Saleh faced a separatist movement in the south, sectarian tensions in its north and the growing presence of what Western officials describe as al Qaeda's most dangerous affiliate, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.","Saleh agreed to transfer power in November .

"London (CNN) -- Trust the carriers of the Persian Gulf to cause mischief again. Having already destroyed the economics of the cosy international airline world, previously dominated by the European airlines, now the gulf carriers seem set to mess up the airline alliances too. All the major European airlines are now part of one of the three big alliances. There is Star (the biggest) based around Lufthansa and United Airlines; Skyteam based around Air France/KLM and Delta; Oneworld based around BA and American Airlines. Read more: How would you save American Airlines? The gulf airlines have until now eschewed the alliances. Firstly because competitively the alliances didn't want them, and secondly because they were growing very nicely, thank you, without them. The reality is the three gulf carriers, Emirates, Qatar and Etihad are forces with which to be reckoned. Strategic investments by co-operative governments have given them large fleets and huge airports. They have created a flourishing environment while established carriers languish. Where London, Paris and Frankfurt were the traditional change-hubs, today Dubai, Doha and Abu Dhabi are perfectly placed at the crossroads of east and west. They are able to open up vast new markets in the Indian and Asian continent, as anyone who has been in those airports in the middle of the night can see. Over the past year the gulf airlines have expanded their investments and routes and in doing so are slowly disrupting, some say destroying, the airline alliances. It is oneworld that is feeling the effects most. First, James Hogan's Etihad bought an equity stake in Air Berlin, a oneworld member. That deal raised eyebrows but it is workable within the alliance. Then, rival Tim Clark's Emirates set up a 10-year partnership with Qantas -- another oneworld member -- which will clearly have major implications on relations with other alliance members such as BA and Cathay. But everyone put a brave face on it. Ailing Qantas announces alliance with Emirates . Today Akbar Al Bakar's Qatar Airways joins oneworld and comes within the fold. So, all three gulf carriers are now, in some shape or form, in bed with oneworld airlines. That would be confusing enough, but now another nail has been hammered into the alliance coffin. Oneworld's Air Berlin (and its paymaster Etihad) is entering a relationship with Air France/KLM, a member of Skyteam. And it's not just a codeshare, but a long-standing strategic tie-up. Hang on. How on earth can a oneworld Air Berlin do a strategic tie up with the leading carrier in a rival airline and keep its loyalty to oneworld? Even allowing for the fact oneworld is a looser federation of airlines than Star, this is a nonsense. The oneworld members are now either in bed with rival gulf carriers or hitched to rival alliance members in strategic partnerships. It beggars belief to think that oneworld can be more than a frequent flyer earn-and-burn alliance under those circumstances. The one who has most right to be annoyed is Al Bakar at Qatar. Once he is a full member he can rightly ask after the loyalties of Qantas and Air Berlin. Are they to his airline as a oneworld member? Or to Emirates and Etihad as their respective partners? We know the answer. It is a mess. More Quest: Chile's president on the U.S.' economic problems . Clark at Emirates has always said the alliances' days are numbered. At this year's IATA conference he sparked a lively debate with the view that the alliances were passed their sell by date because they couldn't address the competitive demands of today's market. He may be right. They were a creation of necessity because global airlines cannot legally consolidate. However, as we are now seeing, the gulf carriers are either joining the alliances (Qatar) picking them off one by one (Emirates) or simply creating split loyalties (Etihad). I predict that Air Berlin will eventually leave oneworld and join Skyteam to tidy up its relationship. I predict Qantas will slowly but surely drift away from oneworld but keep one foot in the camp because of its relationship with American Airlines and U.S. routes. And I predict Star loses Brazil's TAM to oneworld next year. And throughout all of this the gulf carriers continue doing ad hoc deals where necessary (Emirates talking to American, for instance) and re-writing the rules. The point here is that the gulf carriers are in the left seat. They have the planes, the hubs, the connections and are opening up the new markets. Now the alliances have to learn how to deal with it. It won't be pretty. More Quest: Barroso on why European federation is 'unavoidable'","CNN's Richard Quest says the carriers of the Persian Gulf are causing mischief again .

"(CNN) -- Egypt's landmark presidential election looks set to go to a run-off vote in which Muslim Brotherhood candidate Mohamed Morsi could face former regime figure Ahmed Shafik, according to partial results reported Friday. Ballots are still being counted, and the final results of the first round are due Tuesday. Egyptian newspaper Al Ahram Online gave Morsi 26.48% of the vote with results in from 25 of 27 provinces, with Shafik, who was ousted President Hosni Mubarak's last prime minister, close behind with 24.74% of the vote and leftist Hamdeen Sabahy in third with about 20%. The partial results put Abdelmonen Abol Fotoh, a moderate Islamist running as an independent, and Amre Moussa, who previously served as foreign minister and headed the Arab League, in fourth and fifth places, respectively, Al Ahram Online reported. Results are still to come from the Cairo and Giza provinces, which could prove decisive for the first round of voting, the newspaper said. The Muslim Brotherhood earlier told reporters that with about 90% of the vote counted, Morsi -- who heads its political wing, the Freedom and Justice party -- was in the lead, with Shafik in second place. If no candidate gets a majority of the vote in the first round, the top two will progress to a run-off to be held June 16-17. There were 13 candidates on the ballot, although two withdrew from the race after ballots were printed. Whoever wins the historic vote will become Egypt's first freely elected president. But if the first round results in a run-off between Morsi and Shafik, many Egyptians -- particularly liberals and ""revolutionaries"" -- will be very disappointed, said Khaled Elgindy, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington who is currently in Egypt. ""A lot of Egyptians will feel like this is the worst choice that they would have to make because if it really is between Morsi and Shafik, then these are the two most polarizing candidates,"" he said. Many people may opt to stay at home rather than make a ""very difficult choice"" in the run-off, Elgindy said. It is hard to predict where the votes of liberals and revolutionaries will go if they do participate, but the Muslim Brotherhood will have to work hard if it wants to win them over, having alienated many in the past, he said. There is also a chance of further protests and even violence, regardless of who wins, Elgindy said, as revolutionary elements become increasingly marginalized and radicalized. ""There is a likelihood of a 'revolution part 2,' and there is also a growing likelihood of violence,"" he said. ""There are elements that are itching for confrontation on the streets because that's where they feel they are strong."" Elgindy believes the biggest winner could be the country's current military leadership, which has still to detail the powers of the presidency and may see the election of an ally in Shafik. If Morsi were to win, the military leadership would be likely to constrain the powers of the president, he said -- and in any case is likely to keep control of key areas such as defense and foreign policy. The early results don't appear to suggest a surge in support for the Islamists, despite Morsi edging ahead, Elgindy said. Together, the two main Islamist candidates -- Morsi and Abol Fotoh -- seem to have taken about 40% of the vote, he said, a significant drop in share from the 70% of seats won in parliamentary elections in January by Freedom and Justice and another Islamist party. This fits with a trend in the last six months against the Islamist factions and toward stability, Elgindy said. ""This has worked to the advantage of someone like Shafik who can capitalize on the fact that people are worried, are becoming more fearful about the security situation. (There is) also a lot of fear-mongering about the Islamists,"" he said. ""People are disaffected with the Islamists because they saw they had a couple of months in parliament and didn't do much -- and there's a growing sense that maybe they are trying to hijack the revolution and take over."" That said, the apparent success of Morsi and Shafik is not a surprise in that they come from the two most organized, best resourced camps in the election, he said: the Brotherhood and the remnants of the old regime. Morsi is an American-educated engineer who vows to stand for democracy, women's rights and peaceful relations with Israel if he wins the Egyptian presidency. He's also an Islamist figure who has argued for barring women from the Egyptian presidency and called Israeli leaders ""vampires"" and ""killers."" The Muslim Brotherhood had originally pledged not to seek the presidency. Shafik, a former air force officer with close ties to Egypt's powerful military, is seen as representing the interests of the old guard -- those who lost out when President Mubarak was ousted. Mubarak led the North African nation for 30 years before being forced out last year amid a popular outcry. He is awaiting a court's verdict and could potentially face the death penalty after going on trial for corruption and allegedly ordering the killing of anti-government protesters. About half all Egypt's roughly 50 million registered voters had cast ballots by the end of Thursday, the second and final day in the nation's historic presidential election, said Farouk Sultan, head of the Higher Presidential Committee. Amid worries by some that Egypt's current military rulers might somehow hijack the election, Sultan detailed the vote counting process -- including checks and balances aimed at ensuring credibility. According to the committee head, votes will be tallied in the various polling locales by a judge and in the presence of representatives of the candidates. Each final count will be announced aloud, then an official report will be filed that can be viewed by nonprofit groups, the media and candidates, Sultan said. The voting is a monumental achievement for those who worked to topple Mubarak in one of the seminal developments of the Arab Spring more than a year ago. And it could reverberate far beyond the country's borders, since Egypt is in many ways the center of gravity of the Arab world. Distrust and anger in Egypt, particularly against the military's power in governmental affairs, have inspired continued protests, some of which have been marked by deadly clashes. Many protesters are upset about what they see as the slow pace of reform since Mubarak's ouster. Some are also concerned that the country's military leadership is delaying the transition to civilian rule. Worries about the powerful military possibly swaying this week's vote persist despite the insistence of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces that it will hand over power to an elected civilian government. The military leaders put armored personnel carriers on the streets with loudspeakers broadcasting a message that they will relinquish power, but that did not convince doubters. In January, two Islamist parties -- the Freedom and Justice Party with 235 seats and the conservative Al Nour party with 121 seats -- won about 70% of the seats in the lower house of parliament in the first elections for an elected governing body in the post-Mubarak era. The rest of the assembly's 498 seats were divided among other parties. Journalist Mohamed Fadel Fahmy reported from Cairo, and CNN's Laura Smith-Spark from London and Salma Abdelaziz from Atlanta.","NEW: Muslim Brotherhood candidate Mohamed Morsi leads with most results in .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- A violent crackdown by Yemeni authorities has left dozens dead at protests, witnesses and medical officials said Monday. Bloody violence raged Monday in the capital, Sanaa, triggering a new wave of international pressure on Yemen. The United States and the United Nations called for an end to the violence. An official with the human rights group Amnesty International said Yemen is on a ""knife edge"" and the situation could spiral into a civil war. Officials from the United Nations and the Gulf Cooperation Council were in Sanaa, hoping to help organize a peaceful transfer of power. Thirty-one people were killed Monday in clashes in Yemen, 28 in Sanaa, and three in Taiz, according to medical officials. On Sunday, at least 26 protesters were killed and more than 550 were wounded -- hundreds of them by gunshots -- when security forces fired live bullets and tear gas at a massive demonstration in the city, a medic said. The death toll was expected to rise because some were in critical condition, witnesses said. ""The situation is getting very tense,"" said a resident of downtown Sanaa who asked not to be named for safety reasons. ""We can hear gunshots, explosions, RPGs (rocket-propelled grenades) constantly."" ""This now seems more like a military fight, and we're really worried this could become a civil war. We're really worried it could spread all over,"" the resident said. The U.S. Embassy in Yemen issued a statement saying the United States ""regrets the deaths and injuries of many people"" in the protests Sunday. ""In this tense situation, we call upon all parties to exercise restraint. In particular, we call on the parties to refrain from actions that provoke further violence."" The U.S. government remains hopeful for a peaceful transition, the statement said. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's office said he is ""gravely concerned"" and ""calls on all sides to exercise utmost restraint and desist from provocative actions. He strongly condemns the excessive use of force by government security forces against unarmed protestors in the capital Sanaa, resulting in scores of people killed and many more injured."" ""Yemen is on a knife edge,"" Philip Luther, Amnesty International's deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa, said in a statement issued Monday. ""Those who have been protesting peacefully for change are increasingly frustrated by the political deadlock. Meanwhile, eruptions of violence point to a growing risk of civil war. The Yemeni authorities must stop the use of excessive force before the violence spirals out of control."" The Yemeni government has repeatedly denied accusations of excessive use of force, and said the government is committed to establishing a peaceful transfer of power. Yemeni officials have said forces cracked down on those committing acts of violence during protests. State-run Saba News Agency said Monday that ""militias, armed gangs of the Muslim brotherhood, and the Al Ahamar gang and al Qaeda snipers"" had attacked parts of the capital, even hospitals. ""The attack on security personnel and civilians continued Monday, resulting in casualties,"" Saba reported. Amnesty International said that since February, 200 people have been killed and more than 1,000 have been injured in protests in Yemen ""as security forces have repeatedly used excessive force, including by firing live ammunition at peacefully gathered protesters."" A video on YouTube Monday purports to show the body of a 10-month-old child killed by gunmen in Sanaa. According to a medical team in Change Square, the baby was inside his father's vehicle when a stray bullet hit him in the middle of the forehead. U.N. envoy to Yemen Jamal Benomar and Gulf Cooperation Council Secretary General Abdul Latif al-Zayyani arrived in Yemen on Monday, Saba reported. They will be discussing a GCC proposal for transferring power, the agency said. The proposal, backed by the six Arab nations that make up the council, was put forward in May. It would allow Yemen's embattled President Ali Abdullah Saleh to transfer his executive powers to Vice President Abd Rabo Mansou Hadi within 30 days. According to the proposal, Saleh would then formally resign. Saleh initially indicated he would go along with it, but then refused to sign. The ongoing violence is stepping up pressure for a transition. On Monday, troops were seen shooting randomly at protesters as demonstrations continued throughout the capital on almost every street, witnesses said. All roads leading to Change Square, where thousands have been conducting a seven-month sit-in to call for the resignation of Saleh, remained closed Monday. Saleh, who is recuperating in Saudi Arabia from a June attack on his palace, has vowed to return to Yemen to finish his term. The state-run Saudi Press Agency said Saudi King Abdullah met Monday with Saleh, who expressed gratitude for the medical care. The king wished ""all our brothers in Yemen will overcome the current crisis,"" SPA reported. The uprising in Yemen is part of the so-called Arab Spring, in which protesters seeking political reforms have taken to the streets in many countries throughout the Middle East and North Africa. CNN's Mohammed Jamjoom and journalist Hakim Almasmari contributed to this report.","The Yemeni government says gangs and al Qaeda snipers attacked the capital .

But along with the worsening humanitarian situation the council voiced ""concern at the deteriorating security situation and the increasing presence of Al Qaeda."" Embattled Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh left Yemen on Sunday and started a trip to the United States to get medical care. Saleh was wounded in a June bomb attack on his presidential palace. Last year, Saleh signed a Gulf Cooperation Council brokered power transfer deal aimed at ending his country's months-long political crisis. Last week, lawmakers in Yemen approved a controversial law giving Saleh immunity from prosecution -- a key element of the deal with the Gulf Cooperation Council. In return, Saleh will step down from power next month after ruling the country for more than 33 years. Although the deal was hailed by opposition parties in Yemen, youth protesters and international rights groups called the immunity a violation of international law.

"London (CNN) -- British Foreign Secretary William Hague pledged Thursday to help Libya improve human rights and boost stability, as rights groups and analysts warned that urgent action is needed to tackle the problem of lawless militia groups. Libya has achieved much in the year since the start of the popular uprisings that helped bring Moammar Gadhafi's 42-year rule to an end, Hague said in a statement, but challenges remain. Chief among them is how to deal with the many armed groups that took part in the uprising and now continue to exercise power, analysts say. Rights group Amnesty International said in a report Thursday that armed militias are committing human rights abuses with impunity, threatening to destabilize the country and hindering its efforts to rebuild. Detainees at 10 facilities used by militia in central and western Libya told representatives from Amnesty International this year that they had been tortured or abused, and at least 12 detainees held by militias have died after being tortured since September, the human rights group said. The Libyan authorities have not effectively investigated the torture allegations, it added. Hague said Britain would host a conference in the spring to look at ways the government ""can take urgent steps to implement commitments made on upholding human rights and ensure reports of detainee abuse are being addressed."" It will also provide ""practical expertise to promote the rule of law,"" he said, with British experts offering advice to the interior ministry, Libyan police and lawyers. Britain will also fund a six-month program to engage young people in civic society, Hague said. ""The work to rebuild Libya is just beginning and there are undoubtedly challenges ahead. But it is important to remember what has been achieved,"" he said. However, the armed groups -- mostly made up of young men without regular jobs -- are showing little inclination to give up their weapons, analysts say. Jane Kinninmont, an analyst for the London-based think tank Chatham House, said the militias were one of the main challenges the National Transitional Council, the country's transitional government, now faces as it tries to extend its authority. ""They are far more important than alleged remnants of pro-Gadhafi forces -- there are more of them, they can legitimately claim that they helped in the revolution, and indeed they can argue that they did more to remove Gadhafi in practical terms than the lawyers and academics that are running the NTC,"" she told CNN via e-mail. Kinninmont said militia members now need jobs if they are to be integrated into civic society. ""Most of those jobs will probably have to come from the public sector in the first instance, as Libya is an extremely state-dominated economy,"" she said, adding that an estimated 70% of the workforce is employed by the state at present. ""Of course, westerners are advising Libya to focus on diversifying the economy away from oil and reduce dependence on the public sector, but realistically the experience of other oil exporters in the region suggests this will take a long time,"" she said. However, the government has made faster progress than many expected in terms of restoring the functioning of the economy, she said, and oil money could help with the reintegration of former fighters. Noman Benotman, a senior analyst at the Quilliam Foundation and a former leader of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, which aimed to overthrow Gadhafi, said everything he has heard suggests the militia groups have no real intention of laying down their arms. The thousands of militia members countrywide do not view the NTC as being a legitimate political entity, he said. As a result, they argue that they need their weapons to ensure the future security of Libya. Meanwhile, the transitional government has done too little to speak to the Libyan people and instill confidence in the mostly good work it is doing to establish a functioning state, Benotman said. Some militias are forming powerful coalition blocs, making it even harder for the defense and interior ministries to deal with them and enforce the rule of law, he said. David Pollock, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and former senior adviser on the Middle East at the U.S. State Department, agrees that some of the competing regional militias have more power than the government itself. They are using that power ""for extortion, for settling scores, tribal or personal, or otherwise generally for asserting their control over parts of the country,"" he said. He believes the Libyan government needs to strengthen the centralized military, while at the same time devolving some civic power to the tribal and regional groups and spending oil money to aid development outside the capital. This would help to defuse the long-standing tensions that exist between Tripoli and regional power bases, he said. The authorities' efforts to integrate militia members into a regular national army were a good step, he said, but much harder to achieve in practice than in theory. Pollock also points out that while any abuse is unwelcome, the large-scale atrocities committed under the Gadhafi regime were far worse than what is now being reported. Shashank Joshi, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), a U.K.-based think tank, argues that the transitional government had few options when it assumed power. It lacked the military capability or the cohesion to take on the militias after the fall of Gadhafi's regime, he told CNN, and still lacks the capacity to force them to disband. ""It's obviously a major problem that we have abuses committed on this scale... but at the same time there's nothing Libyans can really do,"" he said. ""All they can really do at the moment is take on some of the most egregious violations, some of the people who have committed abuses on the biggest scale."" A form of post-conflict justice is also needed, so that those militia members who have committed major abuses do not end up in positions of power, he said. The dangers of allowing armed leaders to assume power in a new government can be seen in the experiences of Iraq and Afghanistan, Joshi said. ""Libya shouldn't allow these people to have a free pass,"" he said. ""Even if they can't be taken on or disarmed, they can at least be disempowered."" The European Union, United States and other international bodies could aid the Libyan authorities by imposing financial and travel sanctions on those who commit abuses, he added. The international community is guilty of taking its eye off the ball in Libya, Pollock said, and must ensure it backs up the struggling NTC or risk watching Libya ""tip toward more violence instead of getting gradually better."" A spokesman for the Tripoli Military Council told CNN Wednesday that civilian leaders in Libya must do more to assert their authority, holding accountable militia members who perpetrate abuses. ""If the Libyan state is being built, these guys who committed this need to be brought to justice, whether they are revolutionary fighters or not, otherwise the whole world will ask, 'What changed in Libya?' The same systemic abuse and torture is continuing, and this is dangerous for the new Libya,"" council spokesman Anes Alsharif said. ""The only solution is for the government to take over. You cannot let these guys keep holding the prisoners."" Civilian authorities have been slow to step in, Alsharif said, even though some prisoners have been held for months without facing official charges. ""When you talk to the government they say, 'keep them, we don't have time yet,' and this is wrong,"" he said. A process for government takeovers of prisons has begun, Libya's interim prime minister said in a televised address last month. Libya's ambassador to the United Nations, Mohammed Shalgham, told the world body last month that Libya does not approve of any abuse of detainees and was working to stop any such practices. Libyan Interior Minister Fawzy Abdilal told CNN this month that the country's interim government had not yet succeeded in integrating militias from different cities into a national security force. Other organizations have also raised concerns about the militias. The medical charity Doctors Without Borders said last month it was halting its work in detention centers in Misrata because detainees were tortured and were denied urgent medical care. Human Rights Watch said earlier this month that the torture and killing of detainees is an ongoing practice among Libyan militias and will continue unless the militias are held to account.

He was followed by two vehicles and then seized by unidentified gunmen around 4 p.m., the committee said. The identity and motive of the kidnappers were not immediately known. Al-Alam is supposed to head the Libyan delegation in London for the Olympic games, which begin next week. The committee issued a statement saying the ""Libyan sports family"" condemns ""this heinous crime."" It described al-Alam as a ""man who greatly contributed to the"" revolution that led to strongman Moammar Gadhafi's ouster last year. Al-Alam ""bore arms to defend its principles until Libya was liberated from the tyranny,"" the statement said. The committee called on officials in the interim government and National Transitional Council ""to fulfill their duty in finding out the fate of this man and free him from the kidnappers by taking all necessary measures to achieve that, and to put an end to such irresponsible acts that only mean chaos, an attack on public freedoms and extrajudicial detention.""","Ahmad Nabil al-Alam was kidnapped Sunday in Tripoli, the Libyan Olympic Committee says .

"Washington (CNN) -- As Congress debates the size and scope of defense budgets in a looming age of austerity, one senator is seeking to resolve a much older question about the president's ability to exercise military power without the consent of the House and Senate. Sen. Jim Webb, D-Virginia, has introduced legislation requiring explicit congressional approval of future U.S. humanitarian or peacekeeping operations involving the military and likely hostilities. The measure would not apply to instances where there's an imminent threat to the United States, U.S. allies or American citizens. Under the terms of the bill, co-sponsored by Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, both chambers of Congress would be required to vote within 48 hours of a presidential authorization request. ""The question is simple,"" Webb said last week. ""When should the president have the unilateral authority to decide to use military force, and what is the place of the Congress in that process? Year by year, skirmish by skirmish, the role of the Congress in determining where the U.S. military would operate, and when the awesome power of our weapon systems would be unleashed, has diminished."" Webb, a former Navy secretary and assistant defense secretary, was strongly critical of President Barack Obama's decision to intervene militarily in Libya in 2011 without congressional authorization. He has also expressed concern about the possibility of American intervention in the Syrian crisis. Last summer, a sharply divided Congress was unable to pass any legislation explicitly endorsing or rejecting America's involvement in NATO's Libyan intervention. The matter was never voted on by the full Senate. Deep congressional divisions over the mission stemmed in part from a belief among some representatives and senators on both sides of the aisle that Obama violated the War Powers Resolution. Passed in 1973, the law gives a president 60 days to get congressional approval for sending U.S. forces to war, followed by a 30-day extension to end hostilities. While the combined 90-day period ended before hostilities concluded, White House officials insisted the mission -- backed by the United Nations -- did not violate the War Powers Act because it failed to meet the law's definition of combat. Previous administrations also resisted the law's restrictions. ""The (Obama) administration, which spent well over a billion dollars of taxpayer funds, dropped thousands of bombs on the country, and operated our military offshore for months, claimed that 'combat' was not occurring, and rejected the notion that the War Powers Act applied to the situation,"" Webb recently said on the Senate floor. ""I am not here to debate the War Powers Act. (But) I am suggesting that other statutory language that covers these kinds of situations must be enacted."" Webb's proposal notwithstanding, a number of political analysts question the ultimate willingness of Congress to oppose any U.S. military action -- particularly in the post-9/11 era. ""These attempts by Congress to restrict the president's authority as commander-in-chief are almost always symbolic, because presidents rarely enter conflicts without some expectation of public support,"" said Brown University political scientist Wendy Schiller. CNN polling showed a slight majority of Americans in favor of the Libyan intervention in the spring of 2011, though public sentiment quickly turned against the conflict.","Legislation would require explicit congressional OK for military humanitarian missions .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Four staff members of the International Criminal Court were freed Monday after several weeks of detention in Libya, a Libyan liaison with the court said. Judge Sang-Hyun Song, the president of the court, met them on their release in the Libyan city of Zintan, said Ahmed Gehani. Melinda Taylor, a defense lawyer for the ICC, was detained in the city of Zintan after she was discovered carrying documents which the Libyan authorities said jeopardized Libyan national security. Three other court staff with her at the time have also been held. Taylor, an Australian citizen, is not in jail, but was placed under house arrest. They were released because they have immunity from prosecution in Libya due to their association with the court. The Libyan government continues to demand that the ICC investigate the incident and notify the Libyan side of their findings. Before the release, the Australian government welcomed the news that Taylor appeared close to being freed. ""We're very, very happy for her and for her family,"" Bob Carr, the Australian foreign minister, said in an interview with Fairfax Radio. ""But we'll delay the celebration until she's actually homeward bound."" A search in early June by female Libyan guards after Taylor interviewed Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, a son of the late Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi, found documents written by former regime members, according to Gehani, a Libyan lawyer who serves as a liaison with the international court. The documents included a letter from Mohammed Ismail, Saif Gadhafi's former right-hand man. Taylor was also carrying three blank papers signed by Saif Gadhafi, Gehani said. Her meeting with Saif Gadhafi, who was captured last November, was authorized by the international court as part of his rights of defense in the case against him. Both the international court and Libya's new authorities want to put Saif Gadhafi on trial. The court has demanded that Libya hand him over immediately to face accusations of crimes against humanity. Libya appealed the decision, saying that he should be tried at home. Following negotiations with the Libyan government over the detained staff, the court -- based in The Hague, Netherlands -- issued a statement June 22 saying it ""deeply regrets any events that may have given rise to concerns on the part of the Libyan authorities."" It said it had ""no intention of doing anything that would undermine the national security of Libya.""

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Yemen's embattled president was on his way to the United States for medical treatment Monday, officials said. President Ali Abdullah Saleh left Yemen on Sunday and stopped in Oman before continuing Monday on a trip to the United States, Yemeni government sources said. The purpose of Saleh's U.S. trip is a ""private medical visit,"" the Yemeni Embassy in Washington said in a statement Sunday. ""The president will travel back to Yemen in February to attend the swearing-in ceremony of the newly elected president,"" the statement said. At least six family members were with Saleh, two senior Yemeni government officials said. Saleh was wounded in a June bomb attack on his presidential palace. His request to travel to the United States has been approved, the U.S. State Department said Sunday. ""As we have indicated, the sole purpose of this travel is for medical treatment and we expect that he will stay for a limited time that corresponds to the duration of this treatment,"" the department said in a statement. Saleh became the fourth Arab leader forced from power last year when he signed a Gulf Cooperation Council power transfer deal aimed at ending his country's months-long political crisis. On Saturday, lawmakers in Yemen approved a controversial law giving Saleh immunity from prosecution -- a key element of the November deal. In return, Saleh will step down from power in Yemen next month after ruling the country for more than 33 years. Although the deal was hailed by opposition parties in Yemen, youth protesters and international rights groups called the immunity a violation of international law. Protesters have demonstrated for months in Yemen, calling for Saleh to step down. Saleh apologized to his people and called for protesters to stop demonstrations in a speech broadcast on Yemeni state television before his departure Sunday. ""Young men, go back to your homes, go to your families. I feel sorry for you, I call on you to go back to your homes and start a new page with the new leadership,"" he said. But word that Saleh had left the country did not quell protesters' criticisms there. Protesters set up tents in Sanaa Monday, repeating anti-Saleh chants for hours. Organizers said protests against Saleh and his ruling family would continue for months -- just as they did when the president was in Saudi Arabia for treatment after the June attack. ""Saleh left (for) Saudi months ago, but came back. It's not over for Saleh,"" said Hussein Mansoor, a protester in Sanaa. ""We want him to come back to Yemen so that he is tried for his crimes."" Mansoor said that Saleh does not deserve immunity and must be held accountable. ""Saleh will end up like (former Tunisian President Zine el Abidine) Ben Ali, (former Egyptian President Hosni) Mubarak, or (former Libyan leader Moammar) Ghadafi. There is no fourth option,"" he said. Journalist Hakim Almasmari reported from Sanaa. CNN's Mohammed Jamjoom reported from Abu Dhabi.","NEW: Protesters continue demonstrations in Yemen's capital .

"(CNN) -- The 12-12-12 Concert for Sandy Relief marked a historic night in music, not only due to its lineup of music legends but also unique collaborations between artists over the course of the colossal six-hour concert. Bruce Springsteen sang alongside Bon Jovi at the top of the show, while former Beatle Paul McCartney joined the grunge-rockers of Nirvana in the finale. Pink Floyd's lead singer Roger Waters also sang the praises of his 12-12-12 onstage partner, Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder. The two vocalists teamed up for a rendition of Pink Floyd's 1979 hit, ""Comfortably Numb,"" alternating on the song's lyrics. ""Eddie was absolutely amazing, so that was like a dream come true to have him come and sing 'Comfortably,' that was magical,"" Waters told CNN backstage following his performance. The Pink Floyd frontman was so thrilled with his onstage partner that he says he even took a break from performing to show him some love. ""I actually think I stopped singing at one point to kiss him, which is weird!"" Waters told CNN. ""That's very rare that I do anything like that."" Other performers partaking in the benefit concert included Eric Clapton, Billy Joel, Alicia Keys, Kanye West and The Who. Proceeds and donations went to the Robin Hood Relief Fund for Sandy victims. A spokesperson for Robin Hood tells CNN that the foundation will not have a final tally of how much the concert raised overall until Monday, but confirms that advance revenue generated from ticket sales, sponsors and corporate donations reached more than $30 million.

"(CNN) -- Libya said Saturday it will seek extradition of its former spy chief who was arrested in Mauritania and is wanted for war crimes by the International Criminal Court. Mauritanian security authorities arrested Abdullah al-Senussi, Libya's former chief of intelligence and one of the Gadhafi regime's most wanted men. Al-Senussi, the late Moammar Gadhafi's brother-in-law, was arrested Friday evening at Nouakchott airport, a Libyan transitional government spokesman said. He was carrying a fake passport from Mali at the time of his arrest. France is also in the process of requesting al-Senussi's extradition from Mauritania, President Nicolas Sarkozy's office said. Al-Senussi is the subject of an international arrest warrant following his sentencing in absentia to life imprisonment for the September 19, 1989, terror attack on UTA flight 772, killing 170 people, including 54 French nationals, when the French airliner exploded over Niger. His arrest Friday was the result of joint efforts by the French and Mauritanian authorities, Sarkozy's office said. The Libyan authorities were kept informed, the statement added. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said that if ""Senussi is indeed apprehended, of course that would be good news all around."" ""We have a particular interest because of his role in the Lockerbie bombing situation, but it's really good news for the people of Libya."" In 1988, Pan Am Flight 103 exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing all 259 passengers and crew aboard in an attack that was later linked to Libya. Pelosi, who is leading a congressional delegation that traveled to Libya on Saturday, said al-Senussi's detainment could bring some form of ""closure,"" which she described as ""very important."" Interpol had issued a Red Notice for al-Senussi's arrest for alleged crimes against humanity. He is wanted by the International Criminal Court in the Netherlands to stand trial on those charges. Al-Senussi was detained at the airport along with a younger man believed to be his son, said Libyan interim government spokesman Nasser al-Manee.

"(CNN) -- Libya's most recent prime minister under the regime of deposed dictator Moammar Gadhafi was in Libyan custody on Sunday after extradition from Tunisia, a Libyan justice official said. Al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi was handed over to prison officials in Tripoli, said the official, who asked not to be named as he is not authorized to speak to the media. Al-Mahmoudi was arrested in September near Tamaghza, near Tunisia's border with Algeria. At the time, the Tunisian interior minister said he had entered Tunisia illegally without a visa. The ministry said he was attempting to cross into Algeria at the time of his arrest. A decision to sentence him to six months in prison was later overturned on appeal. Al-Mahmoudi is the first high-level Libyan official to be sent back for trial. In November, a Tunisian court rejected a request to release al-Mahmoudi and decided to extradite him despite arguments from his defense team that the lack of stability in Libya means he would not have a fair trial, according to Tunisian state news reports. Human Rights Watch also called on Tunisia to halt al-Mahmoudi's extradition, saying the former premier is expected to face ""a real risk of toruture."" Gadhafi, who ruled Libya for nearly 42 years, was toppled in a civil war last year and killed after several months in hiding.

"(CNN) -- Bloody tribal warfare in a southwestern Libyan city this week ended on Saturday with a cease-fire, government authorities said. The clashes broke out five days ago in Sabha. It left at least 147 dead and 395 people wounded and caused damage to the city's infrastructure. ""The city is calm and stable after the cease-fire agreement today,"" Prime Minister Abdelrahim al-Kib told reporters Saturday. The government, concerned about another outbreak in fighting, warned people against inciting violence. Libya has been beset by the flood of weapons on the country's streets and clashes between rival groups since the Moammar Gadhafi regime was toppled last year. The problem has drawn international attention. Ian Martin, head of the U.N. mission in Libya, this week addressed the fighting in Sabha. ""It is critical that the government and all sides take steps to further de-escalate the situation and address the underlying causes of this recent fighting,"" Nasser al-Manaa, the Libyan transitional government spokesman, said Saturday. As Libyan doctors tend to the wounded, military forces took over the airport and other key locations in Sabha. ""The military intervention in the area is not an act of war, but it is to restore order,"" Manaa said. ""They have succeeded."" Nasser al-Manaa, the Libyan transitional government spokesman, told reporters Saturday said a delegation of experts helped all sides reach the understanding that forged peace.

"N'Djamena, Chad (CNN) -- After spending years of working in neighboring Libya, the last place Daoud Mohammed wants to be right now is back to his home in Chad, the landlocked country in central Africa. With no work and few opportunities, he is worried about his and his family's future in Chad's capital N'Djamena. ""To survive I had to be away -- though my family was here in Chad -- because there is nothing for me to do here,"" says Mohammed. He is one of the tens of thousands of Chadians who fled last year's fighting in Libya and are now back in their homeland. ""I don't have any skills, I don't have any qualifications and the rainy seasons here don't come often enough, so we can't cultivate,"" adds Mohammed, who used to work on construction sites in Libya. Like Mohammed, around 300,000 Chadians made their living in Libya, often filling a gap at the lower end of the labor market, working in oil fields and construction sites. Read more: The Africans looking to make it in China . Many of them would send money back home to their families, providing a lifeline for a country where the majority live on less than $2 a day. The remittances helped kick-start Chad's otherwise largely stagnant economy but this was brought to a halt last year after the revolution against Moammar Gadhafi's autocratic rule also forced thousands of Chadians out of the country. The world focused on the uprising and the war in Libya, but from the onset other Africans were targeted. Mohammed says a group of armed revolutionaries stormed his compound in Benghazi, accusing some 300 Chadian workers of supporting Gafdhafi. ""I don't know why they attacked me. I am just a laborer and I don't care about politics or governments, I just don't know why they did this to me,"" says Mohammed. Fellow Chadian Tidjani Ali Mohamed, who worked as a skilled plasterer in Libya, says he spent months in a Tripoli prison where Africans from many other countries were also held. ""They forced me to confess that I worked with Gadhafi. But since I did not work with Gadhafi I just kept saying that I didn't so they just kept on beating me,"" he says. ""It was constant suffering -- they treated me so badly, they beat me all the time and I didn't know if I would die today or tomorrow."" The International Organization for Migration (IOM) negotiated with the Transitional Council in Libya to get the Chadians and other Africans out in a highly sensitive evacuation operation. In the end, they brought some 90,000 people back to Chad. See more: Is narcotic khat funding terrorism? Though foreigners did play some part in fighting as mercenaries for Gadhafi during the bloody Libyan war, the IOM and local leaders in Chad say the vast majority of Chadians, like Mohammed, were working to send remittances home. ""Libya was always a rich country, they have lots of oil, and therefore there are work opportunities,"" says local leader Sultan Al Sadiq Al Bashir. ""Whoever goes there, even without education, will find something to do. Being a laborer, or working in agriculture, or in construction, there are always opportunities over there."" Chadian economist and former finance minister Ali Abderahman Hagar says the return of the migrant workers has had a deep impact on the country's economy. ""We welcomed 100,000 people who contributed to Libya's development but returned empty-handed,"" says Hagar, who now runs the Graduate School of Finance in Chad. ""It is difficult to feed one person here in Chad, so to feed 100,000 more without having planned for them is dramatic,"" he adds. ""We haven't received enough support from international states, we have in some way become victims of the war in Libya, even if a few Chadians are in mourning of Gadhafi's death."" Like Libya, Chad has significant oil reserves. The resource was supposed to be the savior of the country's economy but people say they've yet to reap any rewards from it. ""For 10 years we have seen no benefit from the oil, nothing at all,"" says Al Bashir. ""People are still poor, people need a lot of things, and the oil is not doing anything for the people."" Opinion: Can Kenya avoid Africa's resource curse? Chad, which has been ruled by Idriss Deby since 1990, has been ranked by Transparency International as one of the most corrupt countries in the world. Its industrial output is also minimal, while its agricultural sector has been hit by successive droughts. Despite some recent reforms, state safety nets are almost non-existent, leaving returning migrants to fend for themselves. Thrown out of Libya and with few opportunities at home in Chad, many of them now believe they've become a burden on the people they once supported. ""Now we have to beg for food and the local community gives us some food and that's how we survive -- we have nothing else,"" says Mohammed.","Chad's economy has been badly hit by last year's conflict in neighboring Libya .

"(CNN) -- In a scene unfolding in many Latino communities throughout the country, the graduation ceremony at Garcia High School in Chicago was especially celebratory Saturday: 20% of the graduating seniors are illegal immigrants who can now put their education to use with work permits authorized by President Obama's new immigration rules. ""What the president did this week was an amazing gift to me and other students who are undocumented,"" graduating senior Andrea Labra, 18, told CNN. ""It's just an emotional thing to have the same opportunities that other students have and that we didn't have just because we didn't have papers,"" added Labra, who was born in Mexico and came to the United States at age 5 with her family. For the class of 2012, the routine tossing of mortarboards in the air was more emotional than anticipated, said classmate Rodrigo Espinoza, 18, who's also an undocumented immigrant from Mexico. His family brought him to the United States when he was 3 months old. ""It's so unexpected,"" Espinoza said of Obama's executive order, announced Friday. ""It's like a dream. I can finally do something with my life now."" Espinoza is going to study bio-engineering on a scholarship at the University of Illinois at Chicago. He wants to find a cure for cancer, he said. ""I'm determined to do it now that I have a chance to do it,"" said Espinoza, who will be the first one in his family to go to college. As an honors graduate, a yellow sash topped his blue cap and gown. ""This is going to change my life. It was a life-changing experience for all of us and for my family,"" he added about the new immigration rules announced Friday. Juan Rangel, the leader of Chicago's largest Hispanic advocacy organization that runs Hector P. Garcia High and 10 other city charter schools, said the White House announcement was ""a high note for the graduating ceremony."" ""It's a timely announcement, and it's coming at the end of the school year,"" Rangel said. In a measure that a Pew Hispanic Center analysis said could benefit up to 1.4 million children and young adults, the Obama administration said it will offer work permits to illegal immigrants younger than age 30 who came to the United States before age 16 and meet certain criteria. Participants must be in the United States now and be able to prove they have been living in the country continuously for at least five years. The centerpiece of the Obama measure grants illegal immigrants a two-year deferral from deportation if they pose no criminal or security threat, and were successful students or served in the military, administration officials said. The change is part of a Department of Homeland Security effort to target resources at illegal immigrants who pose a greater threat, such as criminals and those trying to enter the country now, officials said. For many educators and school leaders across the nation, the new program means undocumented immigrant students can come out of the shadows and underground economy of society and participate legally in the U.S. work force, Rangel said. Equally important, teachers and principals now have an answer to illegal immigrant students who have asked ""what's the point?"" about pursuing a higher education, Rangel said. ""At some point these kids ask themselves the question: they work hard, they get the good grades, but what's the point of going to a university if they can't work?"" said Rangel, chief executive officer of the United Neighborhood Organization, which operates 11 charter schools in Chicago serving 5,500 students. He's also president of the UNO Charter School Network. ""It's almost like a leap of faith that we have asked of these kids: Something is bound to happen, and you can't give up at this point. That leap of faith has been answered, and it opens a whole new horizon for these kids,"" he said. Labra was on the brink of greeting such an opening. ""The emotions that go through me to think that one day when I graduate from college that I might become a doctor or teacher and that I'll be able to do it without having to go anywhere else -- I thought I would have to go back where I came from,"" Labra told CNN. Her parents were equally elated about the graduates' new possibilities. ""I'm so overwhelmed,"" her mother, Yolanda, told CNN. ""I'm very thankful for everything. We have faith that their dreams are going to be realized."" ""It's great that the students are going to have this opportunity"" to work, said Juan Labra. Andrea Labra said she's going to save money for a four-year college by first attending the two-year Harold Washington College, one of the City Colleges of Chicago. She plans on majoring in biology and wants to become a science or biology teacher. Twenty-one of Garcia High School's 107 graduates are undocumented immigrants -- a figure that's not too surprising because the school is located in a Mexican immigrant community in the Archer Heights neighborhood on Chicago's southwest side, Rangel said. The school is 99% Latino, with a 93% poverty rate, but 97% of the graduates are going to college on academic scholarships totaling $4.7 million, Rangel said. Obama's executive order addresses a major concern of the nation's burgeoning Hispanic community -- now the nation's No. 2 group under the 2010 census -- and mimics some of the provisions of a Democratic proposal called the DREAM Act, which has failed to win enough Republican support to gain congressional approval. Both Obama and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano cautioned Friday that the order is not a pathway to citizenship and urged Congress to pass the DREAM Act. The Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors -- or DREAM -- Act would create a path to citizenship for immigrants who entered the United States illegally as children under the age of 16 and have lived in the United States for at least five years; obtained a high school or General Education Development diploma; demonstrated ""good moral character""; and haven't committed crimes that ""would make them inadmissible to the country,"" according to a White House fact sheet.","President Obama's new immigration rules praised at Chicago high school graduation .

"(CNN) -- Airlines canceled more than four thousand flights Tuesday as a massive snowstorm of historic proportions coated the nation's heartland with a thick blanket of snow. ""It's going to take days to clear out this storm,"" said CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras. ""This is a monster."" With more than 30 states under winter storm warnings or blizzard warnings, air traffic has come to a halt in some places. Dallas and Houston in Texas and Chicago, Illinois, are feeling the most impact, said FAA spokeswoman Tammy Jones. ""Travel will likely be difficult to impossible in many areas,"" the National Weather Service said. Up to two feet of snow is expected to fall in the Chicago area, where some weary travelers were already frustrated about not being able to continue their journey. ""I just want to get on a plane today... and get out of here. I don't want to be stuck here,"" said Kristine Whitcher, a passenger from Canada who was traveling through O'Hare International. She's not likely to get her wish very soon. More than 1,300 flights were canceled at the airport on Tuesday. Few flights, if any, are expected to operate out of O'Hare on Wednesday, said Karen Pride, a spokeswoman for the Chicago Department of Aviation. United Airlines, Continental Airlines and American Airlines are suspending operations at the airport after 6 p.m. ET on Tuesday. At Midway, airlines have canceled flight operations for the day. The carriers expect to begin operating again on Wednesday afternoon, Pride said. Both Chicago airports are open and ready to implement a passenger assistance program if the storm leaves any travelers stranded. Hundreds of cots will be available and some concessions will remain open to accommodate them, Pride said. It was also slow going at other airports. Dallas-Fort Worth International reopened late Tuesday morning after shutting down for several hours because of ice, spokesman David Magana said. Only one of seven runways is open and officials are expecting hundreds of flight cancellations.

Delta Air Lines canceled 625 flights for Tuesday. Ahead of the storm, Delta issued a winter weather advisory for the northern United States. Passengers traveling to airports in 20 states through Friday can reschedule their itineraries without a fee or get a refund if their flights are canceled or significantly delayed. Continental Airlines, which canceled 650 flights, will allow changes for travel to, through and from nearly three dozen airports, including the airline's hubs in Newark, New Jersey, and Cleveland, Ohio, for travelers scheduled to fly through Thursday. US Airways has also relaxed its change-fee policies for passengers scheduled to fly through Thursday to or from 27 cities from Portland, Maine, to Akron, Ohio. Travelers on JetBlue flights to and from six cities and metropolitan areas in the Northeast on Tuesday and Wednesday will also be able to change their plans with no fees. United Airlines, which canceled 800 flights, has issued travel waivers for passengers traveling to, from or through 19 states in the Midwest and Northeast as well as five Canadian cities.

"(CNN) -- Chicago life and business coach Nicole A. Dunbar has learned to live with less, and love it.

She subscribes to utility companies' budget plans so she's no longer surprised by fluctuating bills. She totes sales flyers when shopping the supermarket, eats more seasonally and cooks at home more. Her athletic club membership? It's history. Said Dunbar: ""I went out to the (nearby Chicago) lakefront, and that was my gym."" That $150-a-month cell phone bill? Gone. It may not be sexy, but a $55 prepaid phone has taken its place. When first launching Congruency Inc., she ""decided to take contract or part-time assignments that would allow me to build my business while generating another income to cover my living expenses. I could never have come to this place without living simply and not listening to the 'shoulds.' "" ""People don't know what they actually need. A need is electricity; a want is cable."" Because she does most of her coaching work with entrepreneurs and professionals remotely with clients across the country, she's not tied to one physical location. Dunbar's real goal is to spend Chicago's colder months elsewhere -- with her mom in Atlanta, visiting a younger sibling in her native Jamaica -- and downsizing her expenses will give her the freedom to do it. It's all about choice. The ongoing global recession and the accompanying hit to our pockets, bank accounts and retirement funds, not to mention environmental and ecological concerns, have prompted many folks to reconsider what's important. And to some, it isn't what they own or what they can buy. Instead, it's about ""voluntary downscaling"" or learning to live joyfully with less ""stuff."" ""We bought into the media notion that money buys happiness. We really, really tried that for a couple of generations, and it didn't work,"" said Duane Elgin, author of ""Voluntary Simplicity: Toward a Way of Life that Is Outwardly Simple, Inwardly Rich."" Elgin is a former social scientist who also holds an MBA and has been preaching the sustainable-living gospel since the 1970s. The concept of ""voluntary simplicity,"" coined by social philosopher and Mahatma Gandhi follower Richard Gregg back in the 1930s, ""reframes the conversation into a way of life filled with greater conviction, creativity and it isn't just about living with less, but living with balance."" For some, like Dunbar, whose previous work kept her spinning madly on the 50-to-70-hour workweek treadmill, it's about purposefully changing careers in order to do something they love, despite the financial downgrade. For others, it might mean selling their cars and relying instead on their feet, public transportation and car-sharing services such as I-GO Car Sharing in Chicago and LAXCarShare in Los Angeles to get around. ""About half of our members tell us they're choosing to sell a car or not buy a car because of Zipcar,"" said Zipcar chairman and CEO Scott Griffith, whose car-sharing network serves 250 college campuses and more than 50 cities in North America, and stretches across the Atlantic to the United Kingdom, Spain and Austria. ""They also tell us they save on average $600 a month,"" which he said is roughly the equivalent of getting a $10,000 raise after taxes. In many cases, it's Millennials, or those born after 1980, leading the way. A recent Zipcar-commissioned study (two-thirds of so-called ""Zipsters"" are under 35) found 55 percent of those surveyed have actively made an effort to drive less. While more than half cited ""protecting the environment"" as one key reason, a whopping 78 percent who are licensed drivers say car ownership is tough because of high gas prices, parking and maintenance costs. The financial savings are huge, but Griffith said ""the real longterm and more emotional connection is around the whole concept of 'less is more.'"" Spending on experiences vs. things . Francine Jay is the Pennsylvania-based author of ""The Joy of Less, A Minimalist Living Guide: How to Declutter, Organize, and Simplify Your Life"" whose blog moniker is ""Miss Minimalist."" Now in her late 30s, she's been happily living with less for 12 years, thanks to a travel-inspired revelation. ""I always packed as lightly as possible, and found it exhilarating to get by with just a small carry-on bag,"" said Jay. ""I thought, wow, if it feels this great to travel lightly, how amazing would it be to live this way? I wanted to have that same feeling of freedom in my everyday life, so I decided to get rid of all my excess possessions and live with just the essentials. I wanted to spend my time and energy on experiences, rather than things."" A 2009 move -- before which Jay and her husband sold their house, most of their possessions and relocated to London for a stint with only one duffel bag each -- offered another clean slate. ""We lived a rather nomadic life for three years, owning only what we could carry in our bags,"" she said. ""We recently had a baby and are a little more settled now, but still committed to living with as little as possible. Although I didn't embrace minimalism for financial reasons, becoming a minimalist is the best thing I've ever done for my bottom line."" Jay's three major lifestyle changes include buying less (""it's amazing how much money you save simply by staying out of the stores""), decluttering regularly and seeking out versatile items, from dress-'em-up-or-down ballet flats to multi-purpose cookwear. ""I think of minimalism as living with just enough stuff to meet your needs, and nothing in excess."" The 'luxury' of choice . But does simplicity ever feel like a sacrifice? ""Oh my goodness, I never think of minimalism as deprivation,"" said Jay. ""Rather, it's eliminating the excess -- unused items, unnecessary purchases, unfulfilling tasks -- from your life. Well, I may have fewer possessions, but I have more space. I may have fewer commitments, but I have more time. Minimalism is making room for what matters most."" Granted, this is about voluntary downscaling, which by its very definition suggests that those making such choices have the luxury to do so. Zipcar's car-sharing customers, said Griffith, are better-educated and earn more on average than their similarly aged peers counterparts. ""It's not that they can't afford (owning a car); they've learned to do the math,"" he said. ""They've learned you can have a simpler life and one that's more sustainable by living with less."" The real questions, said author Duane Elgin, are: ""'What do you care about? What do you value?' It's important for people to realize it isn't simply the amount of stuff we consume. It's about our families, our work, our connection with the larger world, our spiritual dimension. It's about how we touch the whole world. It's a way of life."" And downscalers like Nicole Dunbar haven't looked back. ""The only thing I regret is I didn't understand this eight years ago,"" she said. When she shares her living-happily-with-less philosophy, ""I hear people say, 'I wish I could do that.' You can; you just need to start asking yourself different questions. You have to understand wants vs. needs and start setting yourself up to pursue these things."" Have you downsized your lifestyle in response to tough economic times?

"(CNN) -- Javier-Angel Balboa scored a dramatic late goal for Equatorial Guinea on Saturday as they beat Libya 1-0 in the opening match of the Africa Cup of Nations. The former Real Madrid striker struck three minutes from the end, latching onto to Daniel Ekedo's pass before firing past Libya's goalkeeper Samir Aboud. The co-hosts (with neighboring Gabon) had the ball in the back of the Libyan net in the first half, but Ivan Bolado's 16th minute effort was adjudged offside by the referee. Libya had chances to equalize, perhaps the best falling to Jamal Mohamed whose shot was parried away by Danilo. Aboud produced a fine save from a Lawrence Doe free kick midway through the second half before Balboa scored late on to grab all three points. The win also earned the team a $1 million bonus, which was promised by the son of long-standing president Teodoro Obiang Nguema shortly before the tournament got underway. Defeat for Libya capped a miserable opening day after a Moammar Gadhafi-era green flag appeared on the tournament's official website. Libyan officials complained requesting that it be replaced with the new black, red and green national flag representing the ruling National Transitional Council. In Saturday's other Group A match Zambia beat Senegal 2-1. Emmanuel Mayuka and Rainford Kalaba put Zambia 2-0 up within 20 minutes -- a lead they maintained until the 74th minute when Dame N'Doye pulled one back. Despite concerted pressure Senegal failed to come up with an equalizer leaving Zambia to celebrate a famous win as the final whistle blew. Their next match is against Libya, while Equatorial Guinea take on Senegal.

"(CNN) -- A 75-year-old Illinois woman flying her kit plane violated restricted airspace during a presidential visit to Chicago and was intercepted by two F-16 fighter jets, authorities said. The fighter jets intercepted a Kitfox Model 2 aircraft when it violated a temporary restricted airspace Wednesday evening in Chicago, said Lt. Col. Mike Humphreys of the North American Aerospace Defense Command. Humphreys said the military planes escorted the small aircraft back to its home airport at Mill Rose Farm in Barrington, Illinois. By the time local police showed up on scene, the plane was already in its hangar, said Sgt. Sam Parma of the South Barrington Police Department. Parma said Myrtle Rose of South Barrington, Illinois, flies almost every day and was not aware President Barack Obama was in Chicago on Wednesday. South Barrington is a suburb about 30 miles northwest of Chicago. Obama was in Chicago to attend fundraisers for the Democratic National Committee and his re-election effort. A Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman said the agency is investigating what may have been a violation of a temporary flight restriction from a small single-engine plane. But the spokeswoman, Elizabeth Isham Cory, said she could not release the name of the individual or where the individual was flying to or from because the investigation is underway. Rose will not face any local charges, but the FAA has yet to decide what action it might take with regards to her piloting license, authorities said. South Barrington police said Rose either didn't have her radio on, or the radio was not functioning, . Parma said the plane had a male name, but could not recall what Rose called it. Rose did not return a phone message from CNN. CNN's Simon Hernandez-Arthur and Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this report .","Police say Myrtle Rose did not know President Barack Obama was in town .

"(CNN) -- A new judge was tapped Thursday to preside over the case of George Zimmerman after the original judge was forced to step down. Seminole County Circuit Judge Kenneth Lester will be replaced by Judge Debra Nelson, who was appointed to the bench in 1999. The move came one day after a Florida appeals court granted Zimmerman's request for a new judge, saying the original judge's remarks put Zimmerman in reasonable fear of an unfair trial. Zimmerman, 28, is charged with second-degree murder in the February 26 shooting death of teenager Trayvon Martin. His attorneys wanted Lester removed, saying language he used in a bail order disparaged their client's character and held over his head the threat of future criminal proceedings. The Fifth District Court of Appeal agreed, and Lester was forced to disqualify himself. Lester revoked Zimmerman's original $150,000 bond after learning Zimmerman and his wife, Shellie, failed to disclose more than $100,000 in donations from the public. The judge then set a new bail of $1 million in July, and it was the language in that bail order that Zimmerman and his lawyers took issue with. The court agreed with Zimmerman's attorneys that Lester ""made gratuitous, disparaging remarks about Mr. Zimmerman's character; advocated for Mr. Zimmerman to be prosecuted for additional crimes; offered a personal opinion about the evidence for the prosecution; continued to hold over Mr. Zimmerman's head the threat of future contempt proceedings, and ultimately set a bond at $1,000,000."" The appeals court also agreed that Lester's remarks ""created reasonable fear in Mr. Zimmerman that the court is biased against him, and, as a result of this prejudice cannot receive a fair and impartial trial or hearing by the trial court."" In his July bail order, Lester wrote that ""under any defnition, the defendant has flouted the system"" and ""tried to manipulate the system when he has been presented the opportunity to do so."" Lester also wrote that it was his ""personal opinion"" that Zimmerman intentionally gave false or misleading information in his bail application -- which is a felony -- and he suggested the possibility of future contempt proceedings. ""Holding this over Mr. Zimmerman creates a horrible chilling effect on this case, on the defense presentation, and cements Mr. Zimmerman's fear that he will not get a fair trial from the trial court,"" the appeals court wrote. Zimmerman is free after posting the $1 million bond. The former neighborhood watch captain has pleaded not guilty to the charges and said he shot the 17-year-old Martin in self-defense after Martin attacked him. Martin, who was unarmed, was walking through a gated neighborhood in Sanford, Florida, to his father's girlfriend's house when he was killed.

"Savannah, Georgia (CNN) -- As Billy Carruthers confidently walks through Savannah's Forsyth Park, the homeless residents do a double take. Most remember Carruthers as a mentally ill, homeless, drug addict who spent his day conning tourists to buy books, then using the money to feed his cocaine habit. Carruthers is bipolar and suffers from depression. It took many years of arrests and falling off his medication before he could kick his cocaine habit. ""They look at me today, there's one thing, beyond a shadow of a doubt that they see. They see change. They see recovery,"" Carruthers said. ""They say, 'Where you been? What happened to you?' That's what recovery is."" Psychiatrist: I hate suicide but also understand it . Today, Carruthers is helping those still living on the streets cope with their mental illnesses as part of an experimental program in Georgia. Supporters of the Opening Doors to Recovery program believe it can help stop prisons, jails and hospitals from becoming dumping grounds for the mentally ill. The program is trying to show state leaders the benefits of putting state money into this front end program rather than funding prisons and hospitals -- which are much more expensive, according to Nora Haynes who oversees the project for the National Alliance of Mentally Ill, or NAMI. ""We've saved the state probably about $10,000 per participant and we have 100 participants ... and that's a minimum,"" said Nora Haynes, overseeing the project for the National Alliance of Mentally Ill, or NAMI, citing data compiled by NAMI. ""We're keeping them out of jails and prisons and state hospitals and we're moving them to recovery which means they'll be going into the system less."" Most of the 100 participants in the program are suffering from a variety of mental issues including schizophrenia, bipolar disease and depression, according to NAMI. Many have long criminal records for relatively minor crimes that sent them to jail or to local hospitals at a huge expense to citizens. Each participant is assigned a peer navigator, like Carruthers. Navigators are a point of contact for participants and help them with doctor appointments safe housing, taking medication and even run-ins with the law. Participant names are entered into a database where they are red-flagged in the system if they have a run-in with police. Then, instead of ending up in jail or the emergency room, the flagged participant is picked up by their assigned navigator -- anytime, day or night. Often, said Haynes, participants' erratic behavior can be rectified by something as simple as getting them to take their medication. A typical stay at a county jail will run about $60 per day for a psychiatric inmate, according to Georgia's Department of Corrections. The supervision provided by the Opening Doors to Recovery program costs about $25 a day. To get her cost-savings point across to Georgia legislators last year, Haynes brought a soda can with a $1160 price tag attached to it. This prop helped her tell lawmakers the story of one mental patient who failed to take his medication, then walked out of a convenience store with a can of Coca-Cola without paying for it, and was taken to county jail. Taxpayers paid $1160 for the incident because the patient spent 21 days in jail. The gimmick caught enough notice to get about $800,000 from the Georgia legislature, to help get the program off the ground. ""The issue is the same across the country,"" said Larry Branson of the Savannah Chatham Police Department. ""Our jails and prisons are the largest mental health institutions in the nation. There has to be an alternative to hospitalization or jail."" A U.S. Department of Justice study in 2006 found mental illness is rampant in the penal system: 56% of state prisoners, 45% of federal prisoners and 64% of local jail inmates have mental health problems. Many are substance abusers. According to the National Alliance of Mentally Ill, prisoners with mental illness cost taxpayers about $9 billion a year. Professor recounts struggle with mental illness . One of the keys to ending this cycle, experts say, is through a personal, one-on-one connection with a trusted mentor. ""I need to have someone who could speak to me in my own voice, someone I could respect, someone I could understand,"" said Carruthers. So, each week Carruthers leads peer groups for the folks he navigates. They've all been homeless at one time or another. ""I'd rather stay healthy than be back in the places I've been in,"" said one female participant. ""I want to be myself and not walk around like a zombie anymore,"" said one man. One person Carruthers cares for and navigates through the system -- who did not want to be identified -- has been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic. He also has a drinking problem and suffers from delusions. ""I just hear voices,"" he told CNN. ""When I was in jail and not taking medications, I thought I was somebody from the Bible. ... I thought my neighbor was talking to me and I took apart the ceiling fan and was trying to find a camera in there."" Canine help for mentally ill . The participant has been in and out of jail for a wide variety of minor crimes -- mainly due to his illness. For a while he lived in a homeless shelter. His parents wanted desperately to help him, but just didn't know how. Finally, one day, they picked him up and got him out of the shelter. ""You're just emotionally worn out with everything,"" his mother said. ""One minute I say, 'Go live under a bridge' and the next, you just want to hold him and make him better."" Now, they credit the Opening Doors to Recovery program and Carruthers, his navigator, for helping him slowly get his life back. ""When I was struggling with the medication aspect, he was always there at the doctor's appointments and he would always come before work,"" the man said. ""He'd go out of his way to make sure everything was OK."" He has been studying to be an engineer. Up until recently, he's been stable, but he had a positive test for alcohol during a drug court appearance, which was a setback in his lifelong battle. His family still believes he has a decent shot at a normal life, due to his newly found help. ""I just want him better,"" said his mother. ""We're not always going to be here.""

"(CNN) -- It's an illuminating idea which its creators hope will help drive up energy efficiency and bring down buildings' carbon emissions. Mixing the idea of Google's Street View with multi-spectral thermal camera technology, Massachusetts-based startup Essess is building a giant database mapping residential and commercial properties in the U.S. The project is the idea of Sanjay Sarma, professor of mechanical engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) who wanted to create a way of identifying and remedying inefficiencies in buildings. Essess currently has a fleet of five cars mounted with thermal cameras that take a matter of seconds to assess an individual building. The brighter the colors, the greater the ""heat leak."" Company CEO, Storm Duncan says they are capturing around two to three million buildings per month at the moment. ""The purpose of the approach is to provide a snapshot of the energy efficiency. It answers about 20-30% of the problems of your home."" Duncan said. ""I consider it a fabulous way to start a broader dialogue about the more comprehensive (energy) profile,"" he added. Essess have also developed computer programs that generate energy reports highlighting specific areas of concern and calculating their cost -- financially and environmentally. The beauty of the reporting system (see gallery) is its simplicity, says Duncan, with consumers immediately getting a sense of how efficient their homes really are. The database will also create what he calls ""an eco-system around building efficiency"" becoming the cornerstone of a competitive hub where homeowners can link up with specialists who can remedy problems. Buildings consume around 40% of the U.S.'s total energy requirements annually, according to the Department of Energy, with over one third of that power going to waste. The company is evolving a business model which Duncan hopes will mean customers won't pay a cent to view information about their home. Instead, audits will potentially become part of the service provided by real estate databases like Zillow and Trulia, Duncan says. Essess hope to have covered 10% of the U.S.'s 125 million properties by the end of the year. Thermal imaging surveys are nothing new, but widespread access to them is says Stewart Little, CEO of British thermal imaging company, IRT. ""Back in the 1980s the cameras cost about Â£250,000 ($400,000). Now they cost around Â£5,000 ($8,000). So the technology's moved on lots and lowered the barrier to entry for companies to go and do it."" IRT have surveyed around 200,000 UK homes since they were founded in 2002, and also offer customers quantified thermal images showing the financial and carbon costs of energy leaks. It's a strategy that's proved highly successful in motivating people to insulate their homes, Little says. The UK's Energy Saving Trust says online surveys and energy monitors can also help homeowners track their energy usage. They estimate that savings could save up to $380 a year by improving insulation. ""The challenge is to do something about it,"" says Rob Bell, a energy consultant and former business development with the Energy Saving Trust. ""With gas and electricity prices only looking like they are going in one direction, the amount you can save is also upwards as well,"" he added. ""The headline figures around how much you can save could be the catalyst to get you from being aware to doing something about it.""","U.S. startup hoping to improve energy efficiency by capturing thermal images of millions of homes .

"(CNN) -- It's a new idea which could resonate with communities across the developing world -- a biomass stove which also generates electricity using sound waves. The Score-Stove is a cooker, fridge and energy generator in one which harnesses waste heat from cooking to power a specially designed thermo-acoustic engine, helping provide energy to areas where access to electricity is limited. The project is being led by the UK's University of Nottingham, but has drawn on the expertise of partners around the world including the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) in New Mexico. LANL researchers Scott Backhaus and Greg Swift demonstrated the first-ever thermo-acoustic engine in 1999, adapting the principles originally outlined by Scottish engineer Robert Stirling in the 19th century. In Stirling's thermodynamic engine (patented in 1816) air or gas is alternately heated from an external source and cooled. The expansion and contraction of the air drives displacer pistons in the Stirling Engine, but in Score-Stove's thermo-acoustic set-up there are no moving parts, says Paul Riley, Score project director. The stove heats a specially shaped pipe at one end while the other end is cooled, Riley explains, compressing air inside the pipe and causing it to vibrate and produce powerful sound waves. ""You can think of it as a big microphone or a loudspeaker working backwards. In fact we are using loudspeakers (which act as a linear alternator) in some of the rigs turning the sound into electricity,"" Riley said. ""It's in excess of 170 decibels -- that's more than the Space Shuttle taking off -- but it's whisper quiet outside the pipe,"" he added. Riley and colleagues at Nottingham have producing 36 watts of electricity under laboratory conditions and recently started installing and testing stoves in Nepal and Bangladesh. ""We must adapt the lab version for each area, taking into account local biomass fuels, types of pots and pans used to cook, along with the everyday tasks the unit will be required for,"" Riley said. In the 2011 World Energy Outlook, the International Energy Agency (IEA) reported that around 1.3 billion people presently have no access to electricity with 95% of this number living in sub-Saharan Africa or developing Asia. Even small amounts of electricity (Score-Stove's aim is to achieve an output of around 150 watts) could transform the lives of rural communities providing light and charging facilities for a booming cell phone market. According to the GSMA -- an association representing mobile phone operators worldwide -- over 70% of Africa's one billion population will own a cell phone by the end of 2012. The Score-Stove also makes cooking more efficient helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limiting exposure to cooking smoke. Nearly three billion people still rely on biomass stoves which cause around two million premature deaths annually, according to the World Health Organization. Making Score-Stoves in large numbers would currently cost around $250 per unit, Riley says, but a target of around $30 in the future is realistic. ""That's the next stage of the research. We hope to be making this in the millions. We are talking to several large manufacturers who are evaluating the product at the moment,"" he said. ""I am convinced that a wood-burning stove that can also generate electricity will benefit these (three billion) people. Perhaps more.""","New multi-purpose biomass stove generates electricity from sound waves created by cooking .

"(CNN) -- Two Iraqi men, who were living in Kentucky, were slapped with long prison sentences this week after being convicted of a series of charges involving a plot to help al Qaeda. ""These two former Iraqi insurgents participated in terrorist activities overseas and attempted to continue providing material support to terrorists while they lived here in the United States,"" said Assistant Attorney General for National Security Lisa Monaco. ""Both men are being held accountable."" Mohanad Shareef Hammadi and Waad Ramadan Alwan were arrested last August in Bowling Green, Kentucky, in a terror-related sting operation. After arriving in the United States, the men were monitored by federal authorities. The men told an FBI undercover agent they wanted to provide weapons and explosives to al Qaeda in Iraq, court documents said. In 2010 and early 2011, Hammadi and Alwan provided sniper rifles, C4 plastic explosives, and two Stinger missiles to a truck they believed would be shipped to al Qaeda in Iraq. Authorities say none of the weapons were ever shipped and remained under control of the FBI. Hammadi pleaded guilty in August to 12 counts, including four counts of aiding al Qaeda in Iraq, authorities said. Alwan pleaded guilty to 23 counts in December, including plotting to kill Americans overseas, the Justice Department said. Alwan, 31, was sentenced to 40 years in federal prison. Hammadi, 25, got a life sentence, the Justice Department said.

"(CNN) -- George Lopez told CNN's Piers Morgan that he's not ruling out the idea of running for mayor of Los Angeles -- eight years from now. The actor and comedian appeared on Tuesday's ""Piers Morgan Tonight."" He provides the voice for Grouchy Smurf in the new movie ""The Smurfs."" ""This is a great city, and it's my city,"" Lopez said. ""I believe that there are certain things that could be taken care of that you don't need a strong political background in."" Lopez told Morgan he cares most about ""bonding the city back."" ""Architecture downtown is beautiful,"" Lopez said, ""and people live here, but they don't have a pride in Los Angeles that they did years ago, when I was growing up."" Lopez's L.A. childhood didn't provide much fodder for his comedy career. The comedian never knew his father, and his mother was an epileptic illiterate who had the mental capacity of an 8-year-old. ""If I was a can of soup at the store,"" said Lopez, summing up his childhood, ""I'd have a dent in me, and I'd be in that basket that they have at the end of the hall, the end of the aisle that says, 'These are 99 cents, everything in the can.' That's how I would have considered myself."" Lopez's grandmother very reluctantly took him in when he was about 10. ""Everything I tried to do for her was met with negativity,"" he said. The comedian never heard his grandmother or either parent say ""I love you."" Lopez told Morgan a story about the only shred of encouragement he ever received as a child. A player for the Baltimore Orioles visited histhird-grade class. ""He said that if you stay in school and you stick to what you want to do, you can become anything,"" Lopez recalled. The message stuck with him, Lopez said. His divorce from his wife of 17 years, Ann, was recently finalized. ""Ann was great,"" he said. ""And Ann came from a family that was very connected. Both her parents were doctors. I always used to say we're opposites, because both her parents were doctors and mine never went to the doctor. ""She brought a sense of family and of home. The holidays were important to her, very important, every holiday. And it's great for my daughter to grow up with that."" The couple has a 15-year-old daughter. Lopez, who recently turned 50, told Morgan, ""I was fortunate enough to be married to her for 17 years. And as marriages go, it was fun. We used to look at each other and laugh, and we had nothing when we started. So it was a great period."" In 2005, his wife gave Lopez a kidney when the comedian was suffering from kidney disease, which is partly why the public was so shocked when the couple filed for divorce in 2010.

"Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- Pro-British political groups planned to meet this week as part of an effort to defuse tensions and stem some of the worst violence in Northern Ireland in recent memory. Rioting flared for a fifth-straight night in East Belfast on Monday as protestors attacked police with firebombs, hatchets and sledge hammers. Authorities accused loyalist extremists of exploiting a decision last month by Belfast officials to stop a century old tradition of flying the Union Jack over City Hall year round. The leaders of the two main unionist political parties said on Tuesday they would hold a ""Unionist Forum"" on Thursday at Stormont to address underlying grievances peacefully. The forum seeks ""to engage with the entire unionist community and to address issues of concern. It will seek to channel unionist efforts through political means,"" said First Minister Peter Robinson, of the Democratic Unionist Party, and Mike Nesbitt, of the Ulster Unionist Party. It was not clear if representatives for the protesters would attend. The British flag has long been a flashpoint between British loyalists -- primarily Protestants who want to remain part of the United Kingdom, and Irish nationalists calling for Northern Ireland to join Ireland. The City Council vote followed a summer of heightened tensions between Northern Ireland's Catholic and Protestant communities. Riots in September left dozens of police injured. About 400 people gathered at Belfast City Hall on Monday as the council met for the first time since voting in December to fly the British flag only on certain days, police said. Demonstrators called for the decision to be reversed. The event was mostly peaceful and was organized via social media, authorities said. The scene was very different in East Belfast. About 250 people targeted police with gasoline and paint bombs, fireworks and heavy masonry. Police fired plastic bullets and water cannon in response. Three police officers were injured, the Police Service of Northern Ireland said. Several people were arrested at the scene of the worst violence. Clashes also erupted between pro-British and pro-Irish groups at a point where predominantly Protestant and Catholic communities meet. Authorities said more than 50 officers have been hurt during the protests over the past week. Read more: Fresh protests break out in Northern Ireland after night of violence . The chief constable for the Police Service of Northern Island blamed the violence on members of the loyalist Ulster Volunteer Force, who were ""orchestrating violence for their own selfish motives."" Northern Ireland's political leaders have called for an end to the protests and politicians, clergy and community met Sunday to discuss possible ways to achieve that aim. Read more: Policewoman targeted as Northern Ireland tensions rise . ""Everyone involved needs to step back. The lack of control is very worrying,"" Chief Constable Matt Baggott told CNN. ""The only answer is a political solution."" Numerous police have been pulled away from normal duties to deal with the demonstrations, Baggott said. Read more: Police: Loyalist paramilitaries behind Northern Ireland violence . The majority of Ireland gained independence in 1921 following two years of conflict. But six of the nine counties of the province of Ulster chose to stay in the United Kingdom, eventually becoming the country of Northern Ireland. In the late 1960s, the conflict between mainly Protestant loyalists, who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom, and largely Roman Catholic nationalists, who want it to be reunited with the rest of Ireland, exploded into a political and sectarian war, known as ""the Troubles."" The three decades of ensuing violence between loyalists and the IRA claimed more than 3,000 lives, most of them north of the border. While the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, also known as the Belfast Agreement, effectively ended the conflict, distrust remains between Catholics and Protestants. Under the terms of the accord, groups on both sides dumped their weapons, and members of Sinn Fein, the political affiliate of the IRA, now work with pro-British politicians in Northern Ireland's power-sharing government.

"(CNN) -- Comprehensive immigration reform has so far eluded President Barack Obama. But with his re-election victory in battleground states propelled by strong Latino support, Democrats and Republicans in Congress have a stronger interest in cultivating support from a group with growing political clout. Here are five reasons why the time may be right for immigration reform to take hold in Washington. 1) The voters have spoken . Immigration reform may not have been the biggest issue in the election -- the economy was paramount -- but it is very important to a key segment of voters. Latino voters turned out in force and helped to tip battleground states in Obama's favor. The number of registered Latinos has increased by 26% in the past four years to 12.2 million, or 8.7% of all voters. That means this demographic will only increase its political power. Issues important to this minority logically will become increasingly important to both major political parties. A new electorate has arrived . 2) Obama promised but failed to deliver on immigration reform . Obama promised to push for immigration reform before the 2008 election and had to answer tough questions from Latinos about why that did not occur. At a forum by the Spanish-language Univision network, Obama was pressed to admit that he had fallen short and took responsibility for a lack of action. But the president also said he didn't promise he would accomplish everything he wanted right away. There also is some Latino disillusionment with the stalled Dream Act in Congress. This proposed law would create a path to citizenship for some young undocumented immigrants. Obama did sign an executive order that defers deportation for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children, but it did not change current immigration law. The president has said he is ready to act. He told the Des Moines Register in an interview before the election that he believes he will achieve immigration reform next year. Opinion: How progress is possible . 3) There is a bipartisan starting point . Having bipartisan support for immigration reform will not ensure passage -- it didn't for President George W. Bush in 2007 -- but without it, chances are even slimmer. Just days after the election, a leading Democrat and Republican announced that they hope to start debate this year. Sen. Charles Schumer of New York, the third-ranking Senate Democrat, and Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina say they will officially restart immigration reform talks that crumbled two years ago. Schumer told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that he and Graham have a plan designed to appeal to interests on all sides of the highly contentious issue, and he's optimistic that it can get through a Congress hobbled by political gridlock in recent years. The plan includes four key elements: stronger border security, creation of forgery-resistant proof-of-citizenship documents, fairer legal immigration for desirable candidates, and a ""tough love"" path to citizenship for those already in the United States. Opinion: Both parties must lead . 4) Republicans want to win a larger share of the Latino vote . The election results thrust the immigration issue back into the spotlight partly because Republican nominee Mitt Romney won only 27% of the Latino vote compared to 71% for Obama. Why Romney lost . The GOP wants to reverse the trend of decreasing Latino support at the ballot box. Already, Republican lawmakers, political commentators and thought leaders have adopted a more conciliatory tone when discussing immigration. Carlos Gutierrez, the former commerce secretary who led Romney's outreach to Latino voters, told CNN's ""State of the Union"" the candidate ""made some mistakes"" during his campaign that ultimately led to a precipitous drop in Latino support. The Republican primary process forced Romney to move to the right on immigration, something that didn't sit well with many Latino voters. To avoid repeating the mistake, Republicans may consider working on immigration reform. 5) Democrats do not want to diminish their share of Latino vote . The Democratic Party benefited from Latino votes but that support is not assured in the future, especially if the Republicans move toward the center on immigration. The Obama administration is responsible for a record-setting number of deportations even as it has employed prosecutorial discretion to focus on high-priority cases. The Democrats will have to work with Republicans if they want to reform an immigration system both parties agree is broken. iReport: Under Deportation, Above Fear .","Barack Obama promised but couldn't deliver comprehensive reform .
Latinos factored heavily in Obama's re-election, giving them more political clout .
In defeat, Republicans may see immigration reform as politically smart ."
"(CNN) -- Egypt's tourism minister plans to install live webcams in holiday hotspots to prove the country's industry remains healthy. Hisham Zazou told CNN that cameras will broadcast live video of holiday makers on the beach ""basking in the sun."" He added: ""This will give more credibility... when [tourists] see it, they will come."" Egypt's beaches of Sharm el-Sheikh and the ancient Pyramids in Giza have long pulled tourism revenue, giving a vital boost to the Egyptian economy. But Egypt's image as a tourism destination has suffered since the Arab Spring erupted in Tunisia just over two years ago and spread across the Middle East. Egypt, with its population of around 84 million, is far bigger than Tunisia and the country's poverty -- with 40% of people living on less than $2 a day -- has fed the unrest. Visitors have shied away from the country through its first uprising and further revolts against the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party under Mohammed Morsy, who took power after the ouster of Hosni Mubarak. The violence and police crackdowns, particularly in the nation's capital, Cairo, have hampered attempts to resuscitate the tourism industry. Read more: Protesters attack presidential palace in Cairo . But according to Zazou, the 11.5 million visitors to Egypt last year is cause for optimism. This is compared with 9.5 million in 2011 and 14.1 million in 2010, prior to the outbreak Arab Spring, according to data from the United Nations World Tourism Organization. Zazou said it is wrong to say Egypt is a dangerous country because of the protests in the capital. He told CNN the unrest in ""one square kilometer in downtown Cairo"" should not dissuade people from the entire country. Read more: Shoes hurled at Iranian President Ahmadinejad during trip to Cairo . On the political situation in Egypt, Zazou expects a new government ""that reflects both Egypts"" to be formed after the next parliamentary elections later this year. He added: ""Egypt is in a transition period, you can expect these things. It happened to other countries... It seems like we're a divided society but we're going to get together."" The British Foreign Office warns against travel to some areas of Egypt citing a ""threat from terrorism.""

"(CNN) -- Her doctoral thesis dealt with how we form our conscience. Turns out she plagiarized chunks of it. A university stripped Germany's education minister of her Ph.D. on Tuesday, after a blogger caught the plagiarism and spent months vigilantly presenting the evidence to the public. Annette Schavan is the second minister in conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel's cabinet who has this embarrassing distinction. Former defense minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg stepped down in May 2011, after large passages of his dissertation were found to have been directly copied from other sources. At the time, Schavan sharply criticized Guttenberg publicly for his shortcomings, according to German media reports. Since April 2012, the blog ""schavanplag"" (for ""Schavan"" and ""plagiarism"") has compared passages of Schavan's 1980 dissertation with sections of written works by other authors -- in multiple instances they match word for word, or nearly. The blog alleges Schavan did not properly source her work and claimed others' work as her own. Schavan, who studied education, philosophy and Catholic theology, received her doctorate with highest honors, including for the verbal section of her dissertation. She has spent her career in education roles in the Catholic church. She denies wrongdoing and plans to sue the University of Dusseldorf for invalidating her degree, according to her lawyers. She has been fighting the blog's allegations in public for months and has given no signs of stepping down as education minister. The board of the department that awarded her the degree said that there are just too many borrowed passages in her dissertation entitled: ""People and Conscience -- studies on the foundations, necessity and challenges in forming a conscience in our time."" The board found that she had ""systematically and deliberately laid claim to intellectual achievements, which she in reality did not produce herself.""","The university had awarded her the doctorate in 1980 with highest honors .

"(CNN) -- It's been a busy month for Rob Lowe. His Lifetime movie ""Prosecuting Casey Anthony"" premiered Saturday with him as attorney Jeff Ashton. On Friday, Lowe will tread familiar territory when his indie flick ""Knife Fight"" hits theaters. The actor plays Paul Turner, a cutthroat political strategist who's trying to keep his candidates afloat amid self-sabotaging drama. Lowe also can be seen weekly as sad-sack health nut Chris Traeger on NBC's ""Parks and Recreation,"" which is shooting its fifth season. CNN recently spoke with Lowe about his projects, his personal thoughts on the Casey Anthony trial, his dream of playing Ulysses S. Grant and working with Matt Damon on ""Behind the Candelabra,"" the story of Liberace. CNN: In ""Prosecuting Casey Anthony,"" you play Jeff Ashton, the trial lawyer. From your perception, what was the biggest factor in why he lost? Rob Lowe: It's a little bit like why the Titanic hit the iceberg. A bunch of little things had to go wrong for the big thing to go wrong. The one I focus on is the jury selection process itself. I think in many ways the trial was over before it began. This is the first big trial in the era of Twitter and Facebook. Not only does information move at the speed of light, but public opinion coalesces at the speed of light through social media. The point is to get a jury who has no opinion. But the thought that they have no opinion when it's been all over social media, all over the public consciousness, all over cable news ... you have two types of people: Either they have no opinion and haven't been living in the real world, and what does that say? Do you really want those people on a jury? Or you have people who have been paying somewhat attention and have heard leaked evidence, which is everywhere. Personally, I think they overreached with charging her with first-degree, special-circumstances murder. CNN: What's the mental state like of a person who's tasked with prosecuting such a high-profile, nationwide murder case? For the moment, he becomes a rock star for people who love prosecutions. Lowe: People went to Orlando just to be a part of this trial. Like it was Disneyland. It's hard to imagine, but it's true. People had T-shirts made that said ""Team Ashton."" To the uninitiated in the realm of the public eye, that's probably an unexpected complication that people deal with in different ways. CNN: The case was somewhat reminiscent of the O.J. Simpson case in that it took on this sideshow circus element. Lowe: The only difference that I would say -- and I'd say it's significant -- is unlike O.J., Jeff seems to be the perfect man for the job. This is his area. He's 12-for-12 in death penalty cases. He's the first guy to use DNA. And yet it didn't happen, which makes it sort of Shakespearean in a way. CNN: Speaking of circuses, in ""Knife Fight,"" you play Paul Turner, a political strategist. Do you have any empathy for people in these professions? Lowe: Weirdly, I have nothing but empathy for people in those positions. I've been fortunate enough -- or depending on your political views, unfortunate enough -- to come into contact with everybody from every spectrum, from George McGovern and Michael Dukakis to Karl Rove. And at their core, they're all real patriots. And they all really believe in what they perceive to be the greater good of our country. It's not this jaded, cynical power play. That's not my experience with those people. Now, do they use jaded, cynical power-play tools? Absolutely. And that's what my guy does in the movie. CNN: The film explores ""damage control"" as someone's area of expertise. A hundred years ago, that notion wouldn't really exist. Lowe: What appeals to me about it, is at its heart, it's about communicating. How do you communicate when you're going into a situation that's already a train wreck? When you look at Lance (Armstrong) or the football dude (Manti Te'o) -- is there a way to communicate their truth or lack of it in a way that brings a greater understanding? I think it's really fascinating. CNN: Let's talk about ""Parks and Recreation."" Is Chris Traeger going to find happiness? Lowe: Chris Traeger is absolutely beginning to finally find happiness. We're a few more episodes down the pike than the audience has seen, and he's going to have a -- as he'd say ""literally"" -- a life-changing opportunity for growth, love and happiness. CNN: He's become such the sad clown of Pawnee (the show's fictional town). Lowe: (Laughs.) I know. He's become the happiest sad person on network television. He embraces life, even when he's steering into a depressing skid. There's a part of him that savors it in a way that I think is sort of sweet and weirdly inspiring. CNN: You've worked with some comedic giants over the years. Who on ""Parks"" do you learn the most about comedic deliveries these days? Lowe: I don't even know where to begin. It's murderer's row. I've worked with a lot of people and I've come to realize that Amy (Poehler) is, without a doubt, the most astute observer of human behavior that I have ever worked with. And has the quickest mind in terms of comedy and the sharpest sense of timing. Without a doubt. I don't think anyone comes close. So that's huge. Then you have somebody like Chris Pratt, who I almost think is the funniest person on the show, who can also be a romantic lead movie star if he wants to. You've got Aziz (Ansari), who has mined such a specific voice for himself that resonates for so many people, that is unique only to him. You have Rashida Jones, who I believe could make Lena Dunham look like an amateur if given the opportunity. And I'm a huge fan of Lena's. Rashida's a crazy talented ""voice of her generation"" type writer. Her movie ""Celeste & Jesse Forever"" was amazing. It just goes on and on. Nick Offerman? Ron Swanson is a once-in-a-lifetime character he's created. CNN:  It's been reported that you're working on a historical film, where you play Ulysses S. Grant. How far along is that? Lowe: It's a big, expensive miniseries. Sony will be making it. I think the latest incarnation will be in conjunction with Reelz. It's something I've been attached to and wanting to do for a couple of years now. We're still waiting for the final OK, and I'm hoping it's a project I'd do on my hiatus, and it would be a dream project for me to play Ulysses S. Grant. He's a very underserved American hero and complicated, dark, flawed. When he died, America gave him the largest public funeral this country had ever seen. He saved the Union. I'm hopeful that'll happen. CNN: Are you shooting anything else this year? Lowe: I have a movie coming out in May with Steven Soderbergh directing and Michael Douglas and Matt Damon called ""Behind the Candelabra."" It's the story of Liberace. Matt Damon and I would sit on the set in our makeup and costume and be like, ""Dude, when people see us in this movie, it's going to be the end for both of us."" It's the most outrageous, over-the-top, hilarious, demented and yet weirdly realistic and sweet movie ever made. And, I might add, it's so gay, it makes an average episode of ""Glee"" look like ""The Expendables.""","Rob Lowe recently starred in a Lifetime movie about the Casey Anthony trial .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Four days after the biggest rainstorm in six decades hit the Chinese capital, Zhang Huishen remains furious over what she perceives as government indifference to her family's plight. ""Our family of five lives off one income,"" said the 46-year-old farmer Wednesday. ""Nobody cares about us because there's no official in this household."" Zhang lives along what once was a paved road in the small village of Louzishui in Beijing's southwestern Fangshan district, the area hit hardest by the storm last weekend. A flashflood has reduced the road to a muddy path littered with furniture, clothes and even a tin shed -- all objects washed away by powerful waters. More rain forecast as Beijing mops up flood and comments . Water marks some two meters high stay visible on the exterior walls of a dozen houses by the road, while mud piles stand outside doorways with flies circling around garbage nearby. Zhang says she largely relies on her husband's monthly wage of $300 to take care of her family that includes the couple, their two children and her sick father-in-law. ""Everything was floating in water -- refrigerator, television, everything,"" she said while showing a CNN crew her just-dried kitchen and living room. ""I borrowed money to renovate the house and lost more than 100,000 yuan ($15,000)."" Zhang and her neighbors alike remember a fearful night spent in dark attics or higher ground after carrying the elderly and children out of fast-rising water -- all the while unable to reach anyone at the city's flood control hotline. One neighbor, Gao Liying, added that she feels even more shaken by the village officials' response when she told them the flood has ruined almost all her worldly possessions. ""They actually said: 'If your house didn't collapse and nobody died, then you're not a victim,'"" she said, raising her voice. ""I asked: are you still human?"" Torrential rain kills at least 28 in southern Japan . Villagers like Zhang and Gao blame local officials for their decision to cover a former waterway with concrete -- thus turning it to a road and diminishing drainage capacity -- and their failure to warn residents before the storm. ""It was more than a natural disaster,"" Gao said. ""The officials are responsible too."" Fangshan authorities have acknowledged shortcomings in the local drainage system, telling reporters they have learned their lessons and will address people's concerns. They also insist the need to prioritize their effort in a district where the storm has affected 800,000 residents, cost at least $1 billion in economic losses, and the death toll is expected to rise significantly. For some villagers of Louzishui, however, such words hardly resonate. As loudspeakers mounted throughout the village began to broadcast propaganda messages touting rapid government aid to victims, Liu Wenzhi scoffed. ""Why bother howling now? Where were they when we needed help?"" the 60-year-old resident asked. ""This is a place led by the Communist Party. Where is our equality?"" Not long after the loudspeakers turned quiet, local officials showed up in two white vans to deliver bottled water, instant noodles and blankets to residents affected by the flood. A shouting match soon broke out between a village Party official and a resident living by the water-ripped road whose home was totally flooded. ""I have to take the overall situation into consideration -- there are many others who are much worse off than you,"" the official shouted at a fuming Zhang Chunrong. ""I don't want your damn stuff,"" Zhang yelled back. ""My husband is a Party member so I was asked to keep quiet,"" she later explained, wiping tears off. ""But I can't bear it anymore -- how dare he come to my home to insult me by saying my loss is nothing?""

"(CNN) -- Monkeys in space. No, it's not the title of a wacky B movie, featuring primates amongst the stars in a bid for intergalactic dominance. Rather, Iran says this plot represents its latest bid to join the space race, though Iran's foes fear the real aim may be to test missile launching capabilities for less peaceful purposes. According to official Iranian news reports, the primate was strapped snugly into a Pishgam (or Pioneer) rocket and launched 120 kilometers (75 miles) into the sky on Monday. He returned back to Earth sometime later, looking shell-shocked but alive as a crowd of men along the desert ground rejoiced, video from state-run Press TV showed. ""Sending (the monkey into space) and retrieving it was the first step for sending humans into space,"" Defense Minister Ahmad Vahidi said, according to the semi-official Fars News Agency. But while it was celebrated in Tehran, the monkey business -- if it actually happened -- didn't play well in Washington. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters Monday that while she saw pictures of ""the poor little monkey,"" the United States doesn't ""have any way to confirm this (happened), one way or another."" ""But our concerns with Iran's development of space launch vehicle technologies are obviously well-known: Any space launch vehicle capable of placing an object in orbit is directly relevant to the development of long-range ballistic missiles,"" she told reporters. Nuland said that, if confirmed, Iran's launch would violate a U.N. Security Council resolution that forbids ""any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons."" But the tone was far different in Iran, where officials characterized the monkey's reportedly successful trip high into the sky and back as a major step forward in its space program. One of the 24 founding members of the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space in 1959, Iran sent its first satellite into space in 2009. Other launches have followed, including of an orbiter capable of transmitting images of, and to, Earth. Monday's reported launch of the monkey -- who was kept in a ""completely sealed"" capsule that produces oxygen and absorbs carbon dioxide, with his vital signs recorded throughout the flight -- is part of a larger effort to someday send humans into space, said Iranian Space Agency Director Hamid Fazeli. It's not the first time animals have reached the skies ahead of humans. The U.S. space program launched a rhesus monkey into space from New Mexico in 1948. Other primates and mice followed, and the Soviet Union a few years later joining the animal space race when nine dogs went skyward aboard rockets. Many more creatures soared into space in the years to come, until Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin orbited Earth in April 1961. American astronaut Alan Shepard made a suborbital flight later that year, and John Glenn became the first American to orbit Earth in 1962.

"Rome (CNN) -- The Italian Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld the 2009 convictions of 23 Americans whom a lower court convicted in absentia of kidnapping a terrorist suspect in Milan in 2003. It's unlikely the court ruling will have much effect on the lives of any of the Americans. None of them appeared at the original 2009 trial, nor were any of them taken into custody, and the Italian government did not ask for their extradition. The CIA declined to comment on the ruling Wednesday. The trial was the first to deal with a practice that human rights groups call ""extraordinary rendition."" They say the United States has often transferred terrorism suspects to countries that practice torture. Washington has acknowledged making secret ""rendition"" transfers of terrorism suspects between countries but denies using torture or handing suspects over to countries that do. The case centered on the alleged extraordinary rendition of a Muslim cleric, Osama Mustafa Hassan Nasr, or Abu Omar, who said he was seized on the streets of Milan in 2003 and then transferred to Egypt and tortured. 2005: Italy seeks Americans over abduction, source says. Abu Omar was suspected of recruiting men to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan and was under heavy surveillance by Italy's intelligence agency. Prosecutors said he was nabbed by a CIA team working with Italian intelligence officials. ""Today's ruling highlights the lack of accountability in the U.S. courts for serious crimes committed by government officials in the name of national security, such as kidnapping and torture,"" said Jamil Dakwar, director of the ACLU Human Rights Program. ""U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks showed that Washington tried to derail the Italian investigation instead of supporting the interests of justice. Though legal questions remain, such as the validity of trials in absentia, American officials would be wise to heed the Italian court's message that those who violate the law will be called to answer."" In the 2009 trial, the Italian court sentenced 22 of the Americans to five years in prison each for their role in the abduction. Prosecutor Armando Spataro said Robert Seldon Lady, who prosecutors say was the CIA station chief in Milan, was sentenced to eight years. Each of the 23 Americans was ordered to pay 1 million euros (about $1.3 million) to Abu Omar, plus 500,000 euros to his wife.","NEW: ""American officials would be wise to heed the Italian court's message,"" ACLU says .

"(CNN) -- People put their newspaper delivery on hold when they go on vacation to avoid a pile of papers on the driveway, advertising their absence to burglars. But for dozens of Californians, that pre-emptive move backfired. Badly. Armed with stolen lists of vacationing subscribers, a troupe of burglars ransacked at least 25 Los Angeles-area homes to the tune of $1 million over a period of three years, authorities said. The team stole computers, jewelry, musical instruments and even collectible swords, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said. The scheme started when 51-year-old Duane Van Tuinen, an office machine repairman, was contracted by distributors of the Los Angeles Times to repair equipment, officials said. Once inside the businesses, investigators said, Van Tuinen repeatedly stole lists of Los Angeles Times subscribers who asked their newspaper delivery be put on hold while they went on vacation. Van Tuinen passed the lists on to three others who carried out the burglaries, the sheriff's department said. Three other men -- Randall Whitmore, 43; Joshua Box, 43; and Edwin Valentine, 52 -- are suspected in the burglary ring. Charges were pending as investigators tried to locate as many victims and identify as many of the burglaries as possible, officials said. Detectives recovered hundreds of pieces of stolen property from dozens of residential burglaries. According to the Times, the burglars allegedly stole $1 million worth of property. ""Although much of the stolen property has been returned to the rightful owners, we are still trying to locate additional victims,"" Detective Jack Jordan of the Major Crimes Bureau said. The Times said it has launched an internal review and has cooperated with the sheriff's department. ""Our customers can rest assured that no financial information was involved and that these robberies, while terribly unfortunate, are likely limited to a small section of the vast area we cover,"" Director of Communications Hillary Manning said in a statement. But going forward, the newspaper said it will no longer share vacation information with distributors.

Let's get the brutal numbers out of the way, and then I'll move to the contradiction to everything I just said, which is the brilliant career of Ozzie Newsome. I mean, among the recent vacancies in the NFL, where 70% of the players are black, there were eight openings for head coaches and seven for general managers. None were filled by minorities. Zero. Zilch. How strange, because this is a 93-year-old league whose most impressive guy at running a franchise these days is darker than Vince Lombardi of the past and Bill Belichick of the present. Photos: Super Bowl by the numbers . I'm referring to Newsome, 56, who harkens of the future, because he has a tendency to stay a few paces ahead of his NFL peers. They call Newsome ""The Wizard"" for his ability to keep the Baltimore Ravens vibrant throughout his decade as the NFL's first black general manager. In fact, this Pro Football Hall of Fame tight end-turned expert talent evaluator has replaced the Gatorade bath after huge victories as the rage around the league. ""It's part of the dream, that dream,"" Newsome told reporters at the Ravens' headquarters last week when describing his NFL success. ""I don't know if I'll have to pinch myself to see if I'm still dreaming."" No, Newsome's NFL legacy is real, alright. Just ask Lionel Vital, who joins Newsome among the league's highest-ranking black executives as the director of player personnel for the Atlanta Falcons. Vital began scouting with Newsome in the Browns organization in the early 1990s, when Belichick was running the show before his prolific stint with the New England Patriots. Later, Newsome was Vital's boss in Baltimore from 2005 to 2007. 5 story lines to follow at the Super Bowl . ""Ozzie understands people maybe better than anybody I've ever met,"" Vital said. ""Those draft picks he makes (through the annual NFL draft) are people, and he just knows how to deal with them. Those guys play for him, because those guys can be themselves around him. ""Whether you're a player or a scout or anybody else in the Baltimore organization, Ozzie wants you to be you, and he lets you be you."" It works. Under Newsome, the Ravens have reached the playoffs seven times (including the last five seasons), and they've made three trips to the American Football Conference title game. More impressive, despite a defense with more aches and pains than anybody in the league, the Ravens used several of Newsome's shrewd picks through the years to reach the Super Bowl on Sunday at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome against the San Francisco 49ers. The Ravens operate with Newsome's fingerprints wrapped around everything they do. The coaching: Newsome hired John Harbaugh five years ago, and this was despite Harbaugh lacking head coaching experience by serving mostly as an NFL special teams and secondary coach. The result? Harbaugh has won 67% of his games with the Ravens. The quarterback: Newsome ignored the fact that Joe Flacco was considered an inaccurate gunslinger for the obscure Fightin' Blue Hens of the University of Delaware. He made Flacco the 18th pick overall of the 2008 draft. Since then, Flacco has an 8-4 record in the playoffs, including an NFL-record six postseason victories on the road. Join our Super Bowl hangout . The others: Newsome is noted for seeing things that nobody else does when studying players in the draft or free agency. His picks regularly are enlightened (see the Ravens' multiple trips to the playoffs). Most recently, there was Newsome taking a chance on 400-something pounds of Terrence Cody, who was considered a bust by many. He was gifted but unmotivated. The Dr. Phil of general managers spent his interview time with Cody at the 2010 NFL scouting combine calling the nose tackle everything shy of a fat slob. Cody now is so slim (well, relatively speaking at 350 pounds) that he is considered a future star for the Ravens. Then there is outside linebacker Paul Kruger, the Ravens' late second-round pick out of Utah in the 2009 NFL draft. He played little during his first three seasons. Then along came those Baltimore injuries on defense, and Kruger showcased all of that hidden depth acquired by Newsome when he finished this season with nine sacks and 42 tackles. No wonder Newsome is revered so much by Martin Mayhew of the Detroit Lions, Jerry Reese of the New York Giants, Rick Smith of the Houston Texans and Reggie McKenzie of the Oakland Raiders. That quartet represents the only other black general managers among the NFL's 32 teams. Game day predictions . ""I tell those guys -- along with others -- to call Ozzie to walk you through the drill over how things should be done,"" said John Wooten, 76, a respected black NFL player personnel director of yore for the Dallas Cowboys, Philadelphia Eagles and Ravens before he became the long-time chairman of the Fritz Pollard Alliance. Among other things, Wooten's group worked in conjunction with NFL officials in 2003 to form the Rooney Rule, which is named after Pittsburgh Steelers chairman Dan Rooney. According to the rule, all NFL teams must interview at least one minority candidate before hiring a head coach or a general manager. The idea is to increase the number of minority head coaches and general managers around the league. Oh, well. ""These are the lowest head coach diversity numbers the league has seen since 2003, when the Rooney Rule was just implemented,"" wrote Harry Carson, the Fritz Pollard Alliance's executive director, in a letter to NFL officials regarding the drop from six to four black head coaches in the league after this past regular season. ""Similarly, no minority front office candidate was selected for any of the vacant GM positions."" So the Fritz Pollard Alliance want the Rooney Rule expanded to include openings for offensive and defensive coordinators. Many of the NFL's future team leaders come from those positions. There currently are six black defensive coordinators in the league and just two black offensive coordinators. The non-fan's guide to Super Bowl parties . The NFL knows there are issues along these lines. Last month, league executive vice president of human resources Robert Gulliver said, ""While there has been full compliance with the interview requirements of the Rooney Rule and we wish the new head coaches and general managers much success, the hiring results this year have been unexpected and reflect a disappointing lack of diversity. Newsome weighed in this week telling the Baltimore Sun ""Is the opportunity there (for minorities)? Yes, it is. You can look at the fact that I am the third of the GMs that have been there (Super Bowl). (Cardinals general manager) Rod Graves had a chance to go with Arizona. (Giants general manager) Jerry Reese has been to two. ""We've had African-American coaches have the opportunity. I've had conversations among the diversity working group committee myself. Are we going to work to get better? Yes, but all we can do is to put people in front of people."" Beyond the quotes, Newsome speaks loudest through his actions as the epitome of what could be for an NFL franchise looking for success. That is, if other blacks are given a chance in team decision-making roles. ""I think Ozzie is an incredible role model for anybody within an organization with the desire to be a general manager, and, honestly, that's true whether you're talking about an African-American or a Caucasian,"" said Thomas Dimitroff, the Falcons' general manager. Dimitroff's late father, Thomas Sr., was a prominent scout for the Browns down the stretch of Newsome's Cleveland playing career that ended after the 1990 season. The older Dimitroff also was around for Newsome's opening five years in the Browns' scouting department. That was before Newsome continued as an NFL boss in 1996 when that particular Browns' franchise (there is another one now) moved to Baltimore to become the Ravens. Said Dimitroff, ""My dad -- as an older school, tough football guy -- was very complimentary of how Ozzie handled that transition from player to team executive. He handled it with tact and with respect to the other football people who were there before him. He didn't just thump his chest to say he had arrived, because he was such a great player."" Newsome still doesn't thump his chest -- you know, even though he is a great general manager.

"(CNN) -- A fumble on the goal line. An interception returned for a touchdown. A missed game-winning field goal in the closing seconds. Most view these as just part of the game of football. But could these things actually be the work of God? Well, according to a new poll, 27% of Americans believe that God ""plays a role in determining which team wins"" sporting events. That means about 80 million Americans believe that God will help one of the teams in this Sunday's Super Bowl. If God influences which teams win championships, it's clear that God likes certain teams more than others. And God's favorite -- and I know many will hate to hear this -- is clearly the New York Yankees. The Bronx Bombers have won 27 world championships, far and away the most championships of any American professional sports team. Other teams high up there on God's fantasy sports team include the Boston Celtics with 17 NBA championships, the Pittsburgh Steelers with six Super Bowl wins and the Detroit Red Wings with 11 Stanley Cup titles. And if God's affection for your team translates into more championships, then God really hates the Chicago Cubs. OK, maybe ""hate"" is too harsh, but there must be a reason the Cubs haven't won a championship in more than 100 years. What did the team do to deserve this much pain? Opinion: I hate, hate Super Bowl parties . Even the Cubs crosstown rivals, the Chicago White Sox, won a World Series in 2005. And keep in mind that organization was involved in the infamous ""Black Sox"" scandal, in which some of its players took bribes in exchange for intentionally losing the 1919 World Series. But despite the Cubs' horrible history, a special place must be reserved in God's doghouse for the NFL's Buffalo Bills. Not only haven't the Bills won a Super Bowl in 46 years, they made it to the Super Bowl four years in a row, from 1991-1994, and lost every time. The most painful loss was in 1991, when the Bills' kicker missed a game-winning field goal in the closing seconds, resulting in a one-point victory for the New York Giants. (Being a Giants fan, I was praying for the kicker to miss, so maybe God was involved on some level.) Of course, if God is helping teams win, how do you explain the success of teams with names like the New Jersey Devils or Duke Blue Devils? The New Jersey Devils have three Stanley Cup Championships and the Duke Blue Devils are consistently a powerhouse in NCAA men's basketball, winning their last national championship in 2010. Perhaps God has some evil competition in the area of sports? In any event, let's turn to Sunday's Super Bowl. Are there any signs that might indicate which team God may support in the match between the Baltimore Ravens and the San Francisco 49ers? It's truly a tough call. Both teams feature stars who have publicly declared their strong connection with the big guy in the sky. The Ravens' Ray Lewis excitedly announced after his team's victory propelling them to the Super Bowl: ""God is so amazing."" While the 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick recently said: ""I think God watches over everybody. ... He has a plan for everyone."" Amid 'storybook' ending, Ray Lewis is still controversial . But public displays of devotion to God alone have not proven to propel an entire team to victory -- just ask Tim Tebow. He's watching the Super Bowl on TV. Maybe we should look at which team has had more success in the past -- that could be a sign. Well, the Baltimore Ravens have won only one Super Bowl, the one played in 2000. But the team has consistently made it to the playoffs, year after year. And while the 49ers haven't won a Super Bowl since 1995, the organization won five NFL championships between 1982 and 1995. So, which team will God be rooting for come Sunday? As someone who believes strongly in God, I actually hope that God could care less which team wins. I'd hate to think prayers weren't being answered because God was watching the Super Bowl. I'd prefer that God be focused on helping people truly in need of assistance with bigger challenges than covering the point spread. To me, San Francisco's Kaepernick had it right with his recent statement: ""I don't think (God's) cheering for one team or another. I think he's helping everybody, just trying to keep everybody safe."" God does, indeed, work in mysterious ways, so we will truly never know if certain teams are favored. But if they are, here's praying that the New York Giants will be back in the 2014 Super Bowl.

"(CNN) -- The stars may finally be aligning for a comprehensive immigration overhaul. Whatever the reasons -- and there are many -- it's about time. During my two terms as governor of a border state, there were times when I was hopeful for a breakthrough. But political fear-mongering often ruled the day as immigrants and drugs illegally crossed into the United States and weapons flowed to the south. With every border flare-up, the American public -- and their elected leaders -- put immigration on the back burner. I am encouraged by the news that a bipartisan group of senators has crafted a plan and is working on building consensus toward a political way forward. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus is also taking an active role and showing leadership on this issue. My hope is that we end up with a truly comprehensive solution that does not tear families apart. Opinion: Worker visas are the key to immigration reform . A comprehensive plan should create a path to earned citizenship, enforceable border security, a realistic guest worker plan, accountability for employers that hire illegal immigrants and passage of the DREAM Act. We have a window of opportunity now that didn't exist before because immigration is at a low point, and addressing the issue makes more sense politically. Our struggle to recover from the financial crisis doesn't just mean fewer jobs for Americans; the lack of work has also deterred many would-be immigrants, especially those who come to America to find construction and manufacturing jobs. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that we have nearly 1 million fewer illegal immigrants living in America than we did in 2007. Census officials say the economy is the primary reason for the decline. The aging population and the growing middle class in Mexico may also be factors that explain the new trend. While nobody is celebrating the poor economy and the lack of jobs, the reality that illegal immigration isn't seen as a ""crisis"" at the moment, gives us the opportunity to have a reasoned debate, without the unnecessary rhetoric, and finally enact a comprehensive immigration plan. With a stable and reasonable immigration system in place, I believe we'll have more opportunities for bilateral economic growth and trade between the United States and Mexico. That will mean more jobs on both sides of the border. Politically, the results of the recent election strongly suggest this is the moment for reform. First, President Barack Obama is following through on his promise to make an immigration overhaul a priority, using the good will he earned with the Hispanic constituencies, and will announce his proposals Tuesday. Second, many Republicans in Congress realize that they need a new political strategy if they have any hope of bouncing back from the devastating losses they are experiencing with Hispanic voters. iReport: Under deportation, above fear . Hispanics of all ethnic backgrounds are embracing Democratic candidates and their message of inclusiveness and opportunity for all. Opposition to immigration overhaul, including the demonization of foreign-born families that look to America for opportunity, is hurting Republicans at the polls. Third, the Supreme Court ruled emphatically that immigration is the responsibility of the federal government, not the states. While I am certainly sympathetic as a former governor with the issues that states must deal with as a result of illegal immigration, the onus is on Congress to pass an immigration plan. Unless we come to grips with all aspects of the immigration issue, we are going to end up with the same impractical, expensive and ineffective solutions we have had for years. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bill Richardson.","Until now, fear-mongering drove immigration policy and overhaul was ignored .
Richardson: With illegal immigration down, GOP realizes it needs to address Hispanics .
He says we need path to citizenship, border security, guest worker plan, DREAM Act .

"Yangjiang, China (CNN) -- In terms of underground Chinese art, Ai Weiwei may be grabbing the headlines but he is just one artist in an expanding galaxy of edgy and sometimes provocative work that has been coming out of China's contemporary art scene for more than a decade. There's Ou Zhihang, better known as ""Naked Push-up Brother,"" a performance artist who disrobes at the scenes of newsworthy scandals and catastrophes and pumps out a series of press-ups. There are the Gao Brothers, whose sculpture of a firing squad of Mao Zedong clones taking aim at a figure of Jesus put them on the wrong side of China's increasingly skittish and jumpy authorities. And in southern China's Yangjiang -- an unprepossessing industrial city famous for producing one in 10 of the knives and scissors found in American homes -- there's the Yangjiang Group; a trio of seasoned drinkers whose work, while not overtly political, attacks one of the Chinese culture's sacred traditions -- calligraphy. ""When I was at school, my teacher used to tell me how bad my handwriting was,"" says Zheng Guogu, an artist in his own right outside the group, but who has worked with the other two -- Chen Zaiyan and Sun Qinglin -- for 10 years. ""But then I thought, who is he to tell me that my calligraphy is bad?"" China works hard to project soft power . In China, writing is considered an artform and is so important to the meaning of the words that the lyrical power of a poem, for instance, is carried through the style of the handwriting. The Yangjiang Group likes to throw thousands of years of culture out of the window. ""When we first started working together we used to drink and then by accident we found things that we'd written that we couldn't remember doing at the time,"" says Zheng. He said the power and clarity of these calligraphic works impressed them so much that drinking became a pre-requisite for their Jackson Pollock-like art jams, sometimes binge drinking for up to three days at a time. ""When you're in this mental situation you don't remember what you've done,"" says Zheng. ""It's exactly this distance and unfamiliarity between your state of mind and what you are doing that draws you to a higher state of art."" The results are as hilarious as they are disturbing. Ai Weiwei places himself under home surveillance . Often taking news events or the media as their inspiration, one piece entitled ""The Morning After: Masterpieces Written While Drunk, No. 1: 'I Need a New Kidney to Kill Bin Laden'"" references American would-be assassin and dialysis patient Gary Brook Faulkner who launched a private mission to kill Osama bin Laden. Another ""Bloodwritten Letter on Imprisonment with the Opposite Sex"" uses calligraphy to retell the shocking news story of a 16-year-old girl who, in 1996, was imprisoned for a week with two dozen male suspects who sexually abused her. Zheng writes the text over an unrelated photograph of what appear to be binge-drinking revelers. As writing, the characters are often so sloppy that a viewer is forced to read the label to find out what the work is referring to. The group says the authorities take no interest in what they are doing and that the works amount to little more than a personal diary. Nevertheless, their art not only challenges China's cultural heritage, it looks at the structures of power and how they work; not least within calligraphy itself which is governed by what is known as ""The 10 rules."" ""I can't even remember what they are,"" says Zheng, laughing. ""All I remember is that they were in our books at school."" Chen Zaiyan says writing in China is still a source of conflict, with simplified characters -- a system introduced under Mao Zedong which drastically reduced the number of strokes and characters in a bid to lift literacy -- still unable to take complete hold in the country even after more than 50 years. ""Before the revolution people used traditional characters and for those people that left, they don't even know Chinese characters,"" Chen, who studied calligraphy at university, says. ""These days you are forced to fill in official forms in simplified characters."" He says there's a gravitational pull towards traditional script because the characters have a deeper cultural sense which he says comes shimmering out of the characters ""like a mirage."" ""Most calligraphers habitually tend to write in traditional script,"" says Chen. ""I think in 20 years or more China will return to traditional script."" Not content with doing works merely on paper, the group has extended its anarchic world to architecture, constructing a sprawling studio in urban Yangjiang that resembles an iceberg. The building, a work in progress, is constructed without plans -- rooms, stairwells and garden spaces are figured out day by day, depending on discussions with the builders. In the countryside, their architectural projects are even more ambitious. In a complex that draws its inspiration from the video game ""Age of Empires,"" the group is working on a sprawling interconnected series of exhibition spaces, rooms and garden areas which requires a team of 10 full-time builders. The group has little in the way of official permission, instead dealing with planning problems as they arise. Zheng says he even once made an exhibit of the receipts of the bribes he had to pay to various authorities to get his architectural projects through. Kick backs in China are often demanded through semi-official means, for instance overly rigorous fire safety standards and the like. The group has a growing following in American and European galleries and says it now entirely funds its projects through its exhibitions. It is currently displaying its works in Birmingham in the United Kingdom. Ling-Yun Tang, Assistant Professor of Sociology at the University of Hong Kong, whose work specializes in the Chinese response to contemporary art, says the international market for provocative works from China is now so large it's a growth industry the authorities are loathe to interrupt. ""At the end of the day, they are not stopping this growth and they don't want to stop it,"" Tang says. ""There are a lot of weird loopholes that artists are very good at exploiting. It's still a bit of a cat and mouse game, but it's much more complicated than it appears from the outside. ""Ai Weiwei is probably more the exception than the rule, although he's an important exception,"" she adds. In the meantime, the Yangjiang Group face more danger from themselves than from China's Communist Party censors. Zheng says only the other two members of the group continue to drink. He gave up alcohol almost 18 months ago following a drunken car crash in which he escaped almost miraculously unscathed. ""I felt that God was sitting in the passenger seat on my right,"" he recalls. ""I just thought if I kept on drinking like this, he may not help me a second time.""","While Ai Wei Wei struggles with the censors, China's avant garde artists remain a force in the country .

"Washington (CNN) -- A 28-year-old Virginia man was held late Wednesday on a charge of assault with a deadly weapon after a security guard was wounded in the lobby of the Family Research Council, a conservative policy organization, authorities said. Police and federal agents were investigating what prompted the suspect, identified by the FBI as Floyd Lee Corkins II, to walk into the group's headquarters about 10:45 a.m. and open fire. Corkins, is from Herndon, a suburb of Washington, the FBI said in a statement about the charge. The guard helped wrestle the gunman to the ground. Called a hero by police, the security officer was in stable condition after being shot in the arm. A law enforcement official said the gunman made some remarks opposing the Family Research Council's policies before opening fire. A source working with the DC Center for the LGBT Community told CNN that Corkins had worked as a volunteer at the center. David Mariner, executive director of that center, released a statement Wednesday night saying he was ""shocked to hear that someone who has volunteered with the DC Center could be the cause of such a tragic act of violence. ""No matter the circumstances, we condemn such violence in the strongest terms possible. We hope for a full and speedy recovery for the victim and our thoughts are with him and his family,"" Mariner said in the statement. Warning signs of violence: What to do . A backpack and a vehicle believed to belong to the suspect were recovered, the law enforcement official told CNN. The suspect's weapon was a legally obtained 9mm handgun, according to another law enforcement official. The suspect had obtained the weapon ""fairly recently"" from a gun shop in Virginia. The council is a Christian group that has pushed family and anti-abortion issues and religious liberties. It has been a leading opponent of same-sex marriage. The Family Research Council recently backed restaurant chain Chick-fil-A after the company's president, Dan Cathy, said the company supports traditional marriage. Investigators said that it was too early to say whether the organization was targeted for its political views, but made clear that would be part of the investigation. ""We don't know enough yet about him or his circumstances to be able to determine his connection to this group or to the business or to what, you know, mentally what he's doing or thinking. So we're going to try to sort it all out, and pull the evidence together, do as many interviews as we can, and get it all together,"" said FBI Assistant Director James McJunkin. 3 killed in shootings near Texas A&M University . DC Police Chief Cathy Lanier said the man entered the building in downtown Washington and was ""confronted by a security guard."" The suspect opened fire, striking the guard. ""The security officer here is a hero as far as I'm concerned. He did his job. The person never made it past, farther then the front door,"" Lanier said. Steve Biondi, a tourist from New York, said he witnessed the first two police officers arrive at the scene. They ordered the suspect to put the gun down. The man got on the ground, and did not appear to put up a fight, according to Biondi. By the numbers: Guns in America . He described the suspect as about 6 feet tall and weighing about 240 pounds.

"(EW.com) -- Once again, it was all about ""The Avengers"" at the box office, as three new releases failed to even approach the Marvel superhero blockbuster's third-weekend gross of $55.1 million, according to studio estimates. The movie dropped 47 percent -- an admirable hold for a picture that's putting up such huge numbers. By the end of Sunday, ""The Avengers"" will have made an estimated $457.1 million domestically, passing $450 million in a record 17 days. (The previous record holder, ""The Dark Knight,"" reached that milestone in 27 days.) Meanwhile, ""The Avengers"" also passed ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" to become Disney's biggest movie ever both domestically and worldwide. It now sits in fourth place on the all-time worldwide chart, behind only ""Avatar,"" ""Titanic,"" and ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows -- Part 2."" ""The Avengers'"" continued dominance meant fewer moviegoers for ""Battleship,"" which sunk on arrival with only $25.3 million. That's the worst domestic opening ever for a movie with a reported budget of at least $200 million. (Universal spent $209 million on the PG-13 picture.) It's also a smaller debut than this year's other notorious flop, ""John Carter,"" which started out with $30.2 million. To the dismay of Tim Riggins fans everywhere, Taylor Kitsch has now starred in two of the year's biggest bombs. ""Battleship"" has so far earned $226.8 million overseas, which will help to lessen the damage from the movie's dismal opening here. Also, Universal will clearly be hoping that the upcoming Memorial Day holiday weekend will soften the film's second-weekend decline. Still, no matter how you look at it, Battleship's performance is a major disappointment. Moviegoers weren't able to get past the idea of a seeing a board-game adaptation crossed with an alien-invasion flick, although those who did see it gave it an okay ""B"" rating according to the market-research firm CinemaScore. ""Battleship"" struggled to attract younger moviegoers, as 55 percent of its audience was at least 30 years old. Men represented 57 percent of ticket buyers. In third place, ""The Dictator"" collected a decent $17.4 million for a five-day tally of $24.5 million. (The movie opened on Wednesday.) The result is a bit of a setback for star Sacha Baron Cohen, whose prior comedies ""Borat"" and ""Bruno"" debuted to $26.5 million and $30.6 million, respectively. Now the question is whether the Paramount movie will fall at the same velocity as ""Bruno,"" which ultimately ended its domestic run with just $60.1 million. Both ""The Dictator"" and ""Bruno"" earned a poor ""C"" grade from CinemaScore audiences, which isn't a promising sign. However, whereas ""Bruno"" dropped an alarming 39 percent from Friday to Saturday, ""The Dictator"" managed to rise 16 percent. The movie cost $65 million to produce and drew a young, male crowd -- 65 percent of the audience was male, and 56 percent was under the age of 25. Overseas, ""The Dictator"" fared well for an R-rated comedy, earning $30.3 million in 29 markets and topping the weekend in Australia and a number of European territories, including the United Kingdom and Germany. The weekend's other new comedy, Lionsgate's pregnancy-themed ""What to Expect When You're Expecting,"" debuted to an underwhelming $10.5 million. The PG-13 movie, which cost $40 million and features an ensemble including Cameron Diaz, Jennifer Lopez, Elizabeth Banks, Chris Rock, and Dennis Quaid, attracted a crowd that was 70 percent female and 64 percent over the age of 25. CinemaScore participants gave it a lackluster ""B-"" rating. Among holdovers, the Tim Burton film ""Dark Shadows"" plunged a steep 57 percent for $12.8 million. The $125 million horror comedy, starring Johnny Depp as an out-of-his-time vampire, has so far drained $50.9 million domestically and $81.3 million overseas. In limited release, the sports drama ""Crooked Arrows,"" starring ""Superman Returns'"" Brandon Routh as the coach of a Native American lacrosse team, scored a surprisingly solid $280,000 from 55 theaters. The British geriatric comedy ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" continued to excel in limited release, grossing $3.3 million from 178 locations. The movie jumped 22 percent this weekend even though it didn't add any additional theaters. However, another British comedy, Hysteria, debuted to only $40,800 at five theaters. 1.

"(CNN) -- More than 1 million cancer deaths could be prevented around the world if more nations, particularly low- and middle-income countries, implemented known strategies targeting such deaths, two international groups say. It's doable, according to the Union for International Cancer Control and International Agency for Research on Cancer, if countries adopt measures to meet the ""25 by 25"" targets the World Health Organization set last year. The targets aim to reduce premature deaths due to noncommunicable diseases by 25% by 2025. Cancer deaths total about 7.6 million worldwide each year. Of those, 4 million are in people ages 30 to 69 -- defined as ""premature"" by the two cancer organizations. ""With the right strategies, at least 30% of (all) cancer cases can be prevented based on current knowledge,"" according to the Union for International Cancer Control. The groups made the announcement Monday, the eighth World Cancer Day. The Union for International Cancer Control -- the largest nongovernmental cancer-fighting organization with more than 760 partners in 155 countries -- organized the day to raise awareness among individuals and governments about cancer and cancer prevention. More than 450 events were held to raise awareness Monday, the group said. This year's theme: to highlight and dispel myths and misconceptions about cancer, including that it is a ""disease of the wealthy, elderly and developed countries,"" according to the organization. In reality, cancer affects those of all ages and income levels worldwide. More lives being saved: Cancer death rates drop 20% . In fact, ""more (cancer) deaths occur in lower and middle-income countries, than in high-income high cancer countries, even though there are twice as many cases in high-income countries,"" said Peter Boyle, president of the International Prevention Research Institute in Lyon, France. Boyle is the main author of World Breast Cancer Report 2012, which was published by the institute and funded by Susan G. Komen for the Cure. It was released Monday. According to his report, more than 1.6 million women worldwide will be diagnosed with breast cancer this year, compared with about 641,000 in 1980. More than 425,000 will die from the disease each year. ""I was shocked by some of the things we found,"" Boyle said, adding he believes there are various reasons why women in poorer countries are diagnosed late. Lack of treatment is one. He cites an example: In Bangladesh, there is one trained oncologist for 150 million people. There's also a lot of stigma preventing women from seeking treatment. ""It's a very, very sad thing,"" Boyle said. For example, in Kenya and Uganda, 100% of women seek help with advanced or metastatic breast cancer, said Boyle. Metastatic breast cancer means the cancer has spread to other parts of the body; advanced breast cancer means it's the most advanced stage of breast cancer that has not spread outside the breast. In both cases, a late diagnosis can impede efforts toward a cure. By comparison, the report said, ""It is calculated that less than 10% of the breast cancer patients in the U.S. are diagnosed with LABC (locally advanced breast cancer). Women in the United States are not immune from late diagnoses."" After cancer, my real fight began . Julie Gerberding, a former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, on Monday addressed the Global Women's Cancer Summit in Washington, a gathering the Komen Foundation hosted. She described three women who died from cancer, either because they didn't know they had the disease or didn't take advantage of screening. They were her aunts, she said, and lived in the United States. Two had breast cancer, and one had cervical cancer. Gerberding said it's a problem ""from Arkansas all the way to Zimbabwe."" ""We must get better at implementing what we already know,"" said Gerberding, who is now president of Merck Vaccines. The summit launched its own ""25"" goal: to improve breast cancer survival and quality of life in 2.5 million women living in low- and middle-income countries by 2025. So much could be done, Boyle said, if existing prevention screening techniques such as mammography and breast self-exams were used and existing treatments were available. He quoted the popular Nike slogan ""just do it."" ""If every woman in the world had adequate knowledge of breast cancer, had access to early diagnostic programs, had access to high-quality diagnostic services and (was) treated according to the most appropriate protocol for their particular disease, then breast cancer mortality would drop rapidly and significantly and have a profound effect on global women's health,"" according to the breast cancer report.

"(CNN) -- The chilling 911 call from a man whose single-engine plane had crashed into the icy Hudson River captures what he thought were his last moments. ""I am going to lose you. I am going to lose you!"" Christopher Smidt, 43, told the 911 operator as he and his flight instructor got out of the aircraft and into frigid waters of the Hudson near Yonkers, New York. ""It's freezing,"" Smidt gasps as the chill of the water overtakes his body. Smidt, a student pilot, and his instructor, Deniece De Priester, 39, were flying a Piper PA-32 late Sunday afternoon, using visual flight rules and not receiving air traffic control services, the FAA said. The calm emergency operator urged Smidt and De Priester to get out of the cockpit: ""I need you to get out of the plane so you are not trapped in the plane."" ""We are out. We're not going to make it to shore,"" Smidt replied on the cell phone that he had used to contact 911. The operator told Smidt that emergency services were on their way. But Smidt was not sure of his fate: ""OK. I'm gonna lose you,"" he said. Those were the last words the operator heard from him. Detective Daniel Higgins of the Yonkers Police Department was among the rescuers who pulled Smidt and De Preister from the water. ""We had access to the pilot boats, so we were able to get aboard and start it up and get to the two victims in the water,"" he told CNN affiliate News 12 Westchester. ""If we didn't get there quick enough, well, let's just say we were glad to get there quick."" Smidt credits De Priester for her fast thinking and her skill, as well as, the New York Police Department and the Yonkers Police Department and Higgins for saving their lives from the freezing water. ""I know I don't want to be back in that water. I don't want Deneice to be back in that water,"" Smidt told CNN. Smidt and De Preister were taken to Jacobi Medical Center on Sunday and released on Monday. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the cause of the crash. Calls to Smidt and De Preister for comment were not returned. CNN's Mary Snow contributed to this report.","Two people were aboard a single-engine Piper that crashed into the Hudson River .

"(CNN) -- When people ask me if there's anything I miss about my old job at Newsweek, it's an easy answer. Besides the amazingly talented colleagues I worked with there, I miss picking the cover. The cover is the calling card of any magazine, but it was particularly true for newsmagazines, since we put out a new issue every week and the range of subjects we had to choose from was so broad. In my era, as competition from more instant news on cable TV and the Web became ever more intense, it was also the one area where our slowpoke frequency could work in our favor. Make a smart call on the cover, and it stayed on newsstands and coffee tables for an entire week for readers to admire and discuss. It's why, for instance, I still hear people talk about the cover story that I asked Fareed Zakaria, my former colleague at Newsweek (and now at CNN), to write after 9/11 called ""Why They Hate Us."" Of course, the opposite was also true. Make a dumb call and you had to live with it for a whole week. A crudely Photoshopped cover of Martha Stewart emerging from behind a curtain after her brief prison stint for obstruction of justice and making false statements to investigators comes to mind. For decades, the cover was also how the fierce competition between Newsweek and Time was defined. In the 1960s, Newsweek became a ""hot book"" after three decades as a distant also-ran, thanks largely to its forward-looking covers on civil rights, Vietnam and the women's movement (not to mention Twiggy and LSD). In the 1970s, it was the cleverness of its cover designs as well as the depth of its reporting that wowed everyone who followed Newsweek's coverage of Watergate. When both magazines put a young Bruce Springsteen on the cover in the same week in 1975, it became conventional wisdom that we tried to copy each other. But the opposite was true: We were always looking to win the cover war, and we exulted when we did. One of those moments came for me the weekend that Princess Diana died in 1997. We held the presses, threw out the issue we had just put to bed and came back into the office in the wee hours to publish a new one. I wanted a striking image for the cover and remembered a black and white photo of a short-haired Diana that had been taken by the fashion photographer Patrick Demarchelier. One of my photo editors, a friend of Demarchelier's, went to his apartment, woke him up and persuaded him to give us the negative. When I saw a wire service photo several hours later of Time's cover, a standard news shot of Diana, I knew our issue would crush theirs on the newsstand. And it did, selling well over a million copies. Some weeks, like that one, the thrill was in ""crashing"" a cover at the last minute when a big story broke close to our Sunday deadline. John F. Kennedy Jr. would perish in a plane accident, or Saddam Hussein would get captured in Iraq, and we'd switch covers and have the satisfaction of looking nimble and newsy on Monday. Details, however, could sometimes get overlooked in the rush. In 1990, when I wrote a Sunday story on Nelson Mandela's release from prison, we put the word ""Free!"" on the cover. We never stopped to think that people would assume we were giving away the magazine for nothing. On slower news weeks, the satisfaction was in posing a pressing or provocative question about the economy, or race relations, or gay rights, or the fight to improve our health or save our schools. Or it was in deciding which icons deserved covers when they died, and what new cultural figures were worth highlighting on the way up. As proud as I was of putting a newly elected senator from Illinois named Barack Obama on our year-end cover in 2004, I was just as proud of selecting Jon Stewart in 2003. Then there was the sheer creative fun of coming up with the designs and words for the cover. I'll never forget election night 2000, when the race between George W. Bush and Al Gore went into overtime. We were closing a special issue, and we had prepared separate covers declaring each man the winner. But what to do now? At about 3 in the morning, my art director walked into my office with an image that her staff had concocted of the two faces melded into one. ""That's genius!"" I said, and we put it on the cover with the headline ""The Winner Is..."" Decades from now, when people have forgotten most of what they read inside the pages of Newsweek, they'll still remember the visual impact of covers like that one. And those of us who were lucky enough to work there will remember those late nights, crowded in the editor's office, competing to see who could come up with the best cover line. It sure was heaven while it lasted.","The cover is the calling card of any magazine, Whitaker says .

"(CNN) -- The tanks of a U.S. Navy warship stuck on a Philippine reef have been pumped full of seawater to keep the vessel stable while salvage ships make their way to the site of the grounding, officials said Monday. Navy-led salvage teams have also removed most of the materials from the minesweeper USS Guardian that could pose environmental problems for Tubbataha Reef, a Philippine national park and UNESCO World Heritage Site. Those materials include paint, solvents and lubricants, according to a statement from the U.S. Embassy in Manila. ""We continue to place extra scrutiny on removing everything we can to mitigate possible damage to the marine environment,"" U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Tom Carney, the on-scene commander of the salvage operation, said in a statement. All of the 15,000 gallons of diesel fuel aboard the 224-foot-long, 1,312-ton ship were removed Friday, the Navy said. ""An equivalent amount of seawater was pumped on her fuel tanks,"" Philippine Coast Guard spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Armand Balilo told the official Philippine News Agency. Dry food stores and the personal effects of the Guardian's crew of 79 have also been removed, the Navy statement said. The seawater pumped aboard the Guardian should keep it stable until salvage ships with heavy cranes arrive this week to begin the process of lifting the minesweeper off the reef, Balilo said. Salvage experts have also begun to reinforce the wood-and-fiberglass hull of the minesweeper with Kevlar lines to mitigate stresses from waves hitting the vessel, the U.S. Embassy said. The $61 million vessel was on its way from Subic Bay, Philippines, to its next port call in Indonesia when it struck the reef, about 80 miles (130 kilometers) east-southeast of Palawan Island in the Sulu Sea, on January 17. Initial efforts to free the Avenger-class mine countermeasures ship at high tide were unsuccessful. Its crew was evacuated to other vessels, and the ship was battered by waves that pushed it farther onto the reef. An investigation is under way to determine the cause of the grounding. A Navy spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. James Stockman, said last week that the U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, which prepares the digital navigation charts used by the Navy, has reported the location of the reef was misplaced on a chart by nine miles. The Tubbataha Reef is home to a vast array of sea, air and land creatures, as well as sizable lagoons and two coral islands. About 500 species of fish and 350 species of coral can be found there, as can whales, dolphins, sharks, turtles and breeding seabirds, according to UNESCO. Philippine officials said this week that the Philippines would seek compensation for damage to the reef. About 1,000 square meters (about 10,760 square feet) of the reef have been damaged.","Materials that could endanger Tubbataha reef have been removed from the USS Guardian .

"(CNN) -- For the last decade, Carolyn LeCroy has been helping children stay connected to their incarcerated parents through video messages. LeCroy was honored as a CNN Hero in 2008, and has since expanded her Messages Project to prisons in five states. Her story inspired actress Holly Robinson Peete, who recently joined LeCroy on a visit to a maximum security prison. CNN's Anderson Cooper spoke with Peete about her experience. Anderson Cooper: What was it about Carolyn's efforts that first sparked your interest? Holly Robinson Peete: I learned about a subset of the population that I never thought of before, which are the children of incarcerated parents. There was something about how hard of a sell it is; anytime you are talking about inmates or people in prison, people automatically -- there's some pushback. But with Carolyn's brand of philanthropy, I just found myself intrigued, and I had to help her out. Read the 2008 story: Ex-con's videos keep inmates, kids in touch . Cooper: How does the Messages Project work? Peete: The Messages Project goes into prisons across the country and films messages of incarcerated parents who are either reading a book, a bedtime story, giving a very positive message, giving love to the caregiver watching these children. Something so simple you would think wouldn't be a big deal, but to a child who's lost their parent to incarceration, they watch these videos over and over again. It has a really positive effect on them. So many times, a lot of these children end up in prisons themselves, and this is something that might be able to stop that chain. I think about watching my father's video. My father's been deceased for many years. When he was at my wedding, he just said, ""I love you."" I watch it over and over and over again, and it just lifts me up. To these children, these are not hardened criminals. Oftentimes they are just looked at as Mommy or Daddy. So, it's very important that the children know it's not their fault and that they know they're loved. More: CNN Heroes . Cooper: How did you get involved with the program? Peete: I met Carolyn in 2008 and we've been trying to get together. ... The Messages Project is now in Oklahoma, in Nebraska, in Virginia. And we kept talking about California. It's the most incarcerated state in the country. And that's where I live. So I said, ""We've got to get in there."" And we finally made it in. It ... was a lot of pressure; I wanted it to go well. Cooper: What did that day involve? Peete: It involved me driving for hours and hours and hours to the middle of the desert, to the middle of nowhere California. ... It involved meeting five inmates who, most of them, may never come out of that prison. And they really didn't strike me as people who had done anything except that they were dads in that moment and they wanted to get messages to their children. Cooper: What's it like seeing someone who is incarcerated and you know why they are there, and yet you see them in kind of a different light when they are trying to get a message to their child? Peete: Apparently these are hardened criminals, people who are doing time for very, very serious offenses, often murder and armed robbery. I personally didn't want to know until I left what they did. I just wanted to appeal to them as a mom and as a parent. I think we don't think about the impact of what the children of incarcerated parents have to go through. Sometimes their parents are just yanked, right in front of their eyes in some very difficult situations with policemen and guns. So, it's a mind-boggling situation for children, and these tiny messages are so impactful. Cooper: It's an incredibly intimate act, the making of these videos. Peete: Even being there and watching some of these men, I was moved to tears because I saw how gut-wrenching it was for them to say, ""I'm sorry. This is not your fault. Daddy loves you and I just want you to be the best person you can be."" Those little anecdotal things sound very clichÃ©. We take it for granted if we've got a parent in the home, but hearing that for a child can make all the difference in the world. I felt like I was doing something not necessarily for the inmates, but for their children. I was impacted by it for the rest of the day, and still am. Cooper: You were recognized by a couple of the prisoners. What was that like? Peete: We walked into the cell block, and ... two gentlemen that came out looked at me. One of them said, ""Hey, Holly. What's going on? Remember you met me in Vancouver, and it was 1980. You were shooting '21 Jump Street.'"" He said, ""I've been trying to get a script to your agent."" ... (laughs) Even in jail somebody has a script for you, Anderson. ... I was just very blown away at his resourcefulness, because sure enough, three days later my agent said, ""Did you meet a screenwriter in jail?"" Cooper: What is it about the CNN Heroes project that really caught your interest? Peete: I'm a CNN Heroes groupie. ... The Heroes just use whatever it is that is at their disposal, and I'm always blown away by what they are able to accomplish with so little. And for no other reason than it is their calling, it is something they are drawn to.","Program keeps kids connected with their parents in prison .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court has tossed out government fines against CBS Inc. and its affiliates for airing the infamous shot of brief nudity involving singer Janet Jackson during the 2004 Super Bowl. Friday's action follows the court's separate, unanimous ruling this month in favor of broadcast television networks. The justices said in that free-speech dispute that the Federal Communications Commission imposed unfair punishment for isolated profanity and sexual content during evening ""prime time"" hours. The FCC had imposed a $550,000 fine against CBS and its affiliates for airing the ""wardrobe malfunction"" incident involving Jackson and Justin Timberlake during the professional football championship game's halftime show. The Justice Department had told the high court there was no ""fleeting images exemption from indecency enforcement"" and that the singer's act was ""shocking and pandering,"" airing ""during a prime-time broadcast of a sporting event that was marketed as family entertainment and contained no warning that it would include nudity."" But CBS countered that the government in recent decades has applied inconsistent rules to indecent words and images, punishing some instances and ignoring others. A three-judge Philadelphia-based 3rd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals panel last November agreed, finding for a second time the FCC had acted ""arbitrarily and capriciously,"" since the commission did not give the media companies proper prior warning about subsequent changes in its enforcement policies. Chief Justice John Roberts said Friday he was ""not so sure."" High court rules for broadcasters on TV 'indecency' ""The agency never stated that the (fleeting expletives) exception applied to fleeting images as well, and there was good reason to believe that it did not,"" he wrote. ""As every schoolchild knows, a picture is worth a thousand words, and CBS broadcast this particular picture to millions of impressionable children."" The chief justice himself is the only member of the high court who is a parent of two school-age children. But Roberts nevertheless agreed with his colleagues to dismiss the government's appeal, in light of the FCC's newly clarified policy allowing for no exceptions to fleeting expletives or images. ""Any future 'wardrobe malfunctions' will not be protected on the ground relied on by the court below,"" warned Roberts. After viewer complaints and national media attention, the FCC said the Jackson incident was obscene. In addition to CBS Inc., 20 of its affiliates also were fined. Congress quickly reacted at the time to the visual shocker by increasing the limit on indecency fines tenfold, up to $325,000 per violation per network. And it said each local affiliate that aired such incidents also could be punished by the same amount. The FCC claimed the network had ""alarm bells"" something might have been up, suggesting Jackson and Timberlake may have planned ripping off the woman's bustier, exposing her breast for nine-sixteenths of a second. The television networks say their scripted shows no longer air nudity, racy images or expletives, even after 10 p.m., when some potentially vulgar words may be permitted. They worry, however, about unplanned, often spontaneous indecent or profane incidents at live events, such as awards shows and sporting events. Company officials say such programs are often on a five-second delay, and censors are on hand to bleep any offensive language. But some indecent words can slip through, they admit, and they want to be protected from heavy government fines. The ""wardrobe malfunction"" case is FCC v. CBS Corp. (11-1240).","NEW: Roberts: ""Any future 'wardrobe malfunctions' will not be protected"" by this ruling .

"(Financial Times) -- Foxconn, the contract manufacturer whose biggest customer is Apple, is preparing genuinely representative labour union elections in its factories in China for the first time, a powerful sign of the changes in the workshop of the world demanded by an increasingly restive workforce. This would be the first such exercise at a large company in China, where labour unions have traditionally been controlled by management and local government. Foxconn is the country's largest private sector employer with 1.2m mainland workers. The Taiwanese company, the world's largest contract maker of electronics, said that the new election process would see a larger representation of junior employees and no management involvement. ""The position of chairman and 20 committee members of the Foxconn Federation of Labour Unions Committee will be determined through elections once every five years through an anonymous ballot voting process,"" Foxconn said in response to questions from the Financial Times. The move is part of Foxconn's attempts to tweak its manufacturing machine, which makes a large proportion of the world's gadgets such as iPhones, tablets and computers, in response to frequent worker protests, riots, strikes and soaring labour costs. Beijing is also encouraging collective bargaining as a way to help contain the growing unrest. Since a wave of worker suicides at the company's Chinese plants in 2009 and 2010, its treatment of its huge workforce has attracted intense scrutiny. Foxconn has become a focus for criticism of practices widespread in Chinese factories including illegal overtime, low pay and the use of underage workers. Apple reacted by bringing in the Fair Labor Association, a US-based labour group, for an audit of some of the manufacturer's largest plants. One of the issues pinpointed by the FLA was the union's failure truly to represent workers. After the Lunar New Year holiday this month, Foxconn, with the help of the FLA, will begin training its Chinese workers in how to vote for their representatives. They will be choosing up to 18,000 union committees whose terms expire this year and in 2014, according to three people familiar with the situation. Since the unions have so far had no real role in addressing worker grievances and have been dominated by management, most young workers know nothing about what a real labour union is supposed to do. Foxconn said more than 70 per cent of the 188 employee-elected representatives at its Shenzhen campus were frontline workers. However, sources familiar with the matter said workers have historically had little say in the committees that run the union. ""The process through which Foxconn's current labour union representatives were chosen was not democratic because there was no open and transparent nomination of candidates, and it is not representative because more than half of the committee members are from management,"" said one person working on the election plans. The chairman of Foxconn's labour union in China, Chen Peng, is the former head of the office of Terry Gou, the company's founder and chief executive. People familiar with the company described Ms Peng, who uses the English name Peggy, as a key confidante of Mr Gou and a trusted member of the management team in China.

"Chicago (CNN) -- Months after he was found guilty of murdering entertainer Jennifer Hudson's mother, brother and nephew, William Balfour on Tuesday was handed down three consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole plus 120 years, Penny Mateck of the Cook County Sheriff's office said. ""This significant sentence is appropriate given the heinous and inhumane nature of these crimes which demanded the full force of justice,"" Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez said in a statement. In May, a jury found Balfour guilty on three counts of first-degree murder and four other counts related to the 2008 deaths of Hudson's mother, Darnell Donerson; her brother, Jason Hudson; and Hudson's nephew, 7-year-old Julian King. Balfour was accused of fatally shooting the singer's mother and brother in their Chicago home in October 2008. The body of the nephew was found three days later in an abandoned vehicle. Prosecutors portrayed Balfour as a jealous man who murdered the three in a rage at the thought that his wife had a boyfriend. Balfour found guilty of murder in death of Jennifer Hudson's kin . During the trial, Hudson was called as the prosecution's first of more than 80 witnesses. She broke down in tears several times on the stand and talked about her family. ""None of us wanted her to marry him,"" Hudson said of her sister's choice of Balfour. ""We did not like how he treated her. ""Where he was, I tried not to be,"" she said. The crimes took place a year after Hudson, who rose to fame as a contestant on ""American Idol,"" won an Oscar for her role in the movie ""Dreamgirls."" Hudson spoke about her mother in an interview with CNN's Piers Morgan this year. ""My mother was a very wise and strong person. I feel like she raised us well, and she prepared me well, and so that's what I live by,"" she said. More from CNN Justice . Philly priest gets 3 to 6 years in abuse case .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- A couple of years ago, Hollywood legend Kirk Douglas declared that it was time to undertake ""an audit of my life."" Now, at the age of 92, he's going public with the results. Kirk Douglas, now 92, recently starred in a one-man show about his life and work. Douglas takes an unsparing look at his personal life and career in his one-man show, ""Before I Forget,"" which just completed its run at a theater that bears his name in Culver City, California. Over the course of the 1½-hour show, he delved into his brushes with death (a helicopter-plane collision that claimed two lives, his suicidal thoughts after a stroke in 1994); the death of his youngest son, Eric (from an accidental drug overdose in 2004); his troubled relationship with a father who could never express his love for him; and his key role in smashing the Hollywood blacklist of the 1950s. Douglas plans to turn the show into a TV special and DVD, with the proceeds benefiting the Motion Picture and Television Home, where he endowed a wing named for his father, Harry. He invited CNN to his home in Beverly Hills to discuss his show and what he's learned about himself over the course of a life that began in 1916 in Amsterdam, New York, as Issur Danielovitch.  Watch Douglas reflect on his life » . Below is an edited version of his remarks. Kirk Douglas: All my life, I have taken inventory at intervals. For example, when I became a movie actor and suddenly I had to deal with fame, money and playing so many roles, I lost myself. I said, ""Who am I?"" And I wrote my first book to deal with that, ""The Ragman's Son."" Then the next thing that happened: I was in a helicopter crash. We crashed into a small plane with two young people who were killed instantly. I fell to the ground, and I said, ""Why?"" I tried to find God, so I wrote a book, ""Climbing the Mountain."" Then the worst accident in my life happened with a tingling across my cheek, and then it developed into a stroke, and I couldn't talk, and an actor who can't talk is a big problem. But then I wrote the book ""My Stroke of Luck"" that helped me and helped a lot of other people. That was gratifying. After that, here I was, 92 years old, impediment in my speech, and was reflecting on my life, and people thought I would write another book, and I said no, I'm going to do a one-man show. My friends laughed; they thought it was a joke, but I did it. CNN: You are brutally honest in your show. Did you ever hesitate and think, ""this is too personal, and maybe I shouldn't do this?"" Douglas: Well, listen, I'm an actor; I have made my living by acting, and I almost think I owe it to the public to express my feelings and not as a character on a screen but as myself. CNN: What kind of reaction did you get from people? Douglas: Well, so many people cried, and I thought, you know, it's easy to make people cry, but it's more important to make people laugh. ... Especially in this world today, if you don't laugh, you cry. CNN: I was surprised at how much humor there was in the show. One of the lines that got laughs was when you described talking to an old actor friend of yours. You told him, ""I'm doing a one-man show,"" and he said ... Douglas: ""Is there any part in it for me?"" You know, actors are pathetic. We are desperate, you know, and an actor -- instead of like a writer, you can criticize their writing, an actor, you criticize him. It's very personal. It makes you very vulnerable. CNN: You speak of a long life and of your brushes with death, and you say it in a humorous way in the show, like, ""does God hate me?"" Douglas: I have so many things that were happening to me: the stroke, the helicopter crash, a broken back, I broke two knees, then I thought maybe God is mad at me. CNN: But in all seriousness, did you take any of this as a message from above? Douglas: Well, I don't know. I have studied religion, and I have concluded that there is some power. We don't understand it. Nobody really saw the Pearly Gates or hell. But I feel affected by nature. If I look at the trees, or the other day we got a bouquet of roses, and there were white roses tinted red, and I thought, ""How does that happen?"" So if you look at nature, you begin to think that there is some power behind everything. I don't know what it is, and I don't think anybody knows. You either have to believe that there is, or you don't. CNN: You've had a really interesting spiritual journey in your life, and you have explored your Judaism much more as you got older. Douglas: I studied Judaism a lot. I studied religion in general, and I have never imposed my Judaism on my kids. They are what they want to be. I think ... you must care for others. That's the correct religion, I think. You have to learn eventually to care for other people. My mother said once to me -- and we were very poor -- but my mother said, ""A beggar must give something to another beggar who is worse off than he."" And that has stuck with me. ... If people give whatever they can give to help other people, we will solve all of the problems of the world. ... Being an actor is narcissistic, because you are the vehicle of the [character], but lately as I mature I realize you have to help people. ... I think I've been very lucky despite all of the accidents that I have had. ... I have a career that I'm proud of, and I think I owe something to the world that I grew up in. CNN: You played a key role in breaking the Hollywood blacklist by giving screen credit to Dalton Trumbo in 1960 for writing ""Spartacus."" That's something that you look back on with a great sense of pride. Douglas: That is the thing that I'm most proud of, and I think it happened to me [at the right time]. I was young enough to be impulsive but mature enough to realize what I was doing. ... People would say, ""Hey, Kirk, are you crazy? You'll never work in Hollywood again."" You know, I did it, and it's one thing that I will always be proud of. CNN: In the show, you talk very candidly about your relationship with your father and that yearning you had. Douglas: That moved a lot of people, and I didn't realize how many people identified with that. How many people didn't get the pat on the back that they wanted from their father? Not only men, I have had women tell me that. Amazing. CNN: In the show, you also talk about the loss of your son Eric and how painful that was for you. Douglas: Of course the death of Eric, my youngest son, was a tragedy. Everyone has a tragedy of some sort in their life, but when you lose a loved one, you never get over it. People try to help you, but they have no clue. It's always a sad part of your life, and you have to deal with it, after you get through the pain of thinking ""What did I do wrong?"" you know. You just have to accept it as part of life. CNN: I was intrigued by something you wrote in your most recent book, ""Let's Face It."" You said, ""I like Issur more than I like Kirk Douglas."" Douglas: Issur was my original name, and as I say in my one-man show ... I have to remember that. Like childhood actors, they get you to change your name. Kirk Douglas was not the essence of what I am. Issur is what I am, and I think that that's very important to remember. I like the fact that now lots of actors keep their ethnic names. ... You have to face reality, and I face reality by going back in my life to what I am. CNN: If you were an actor coming up now, would you have kept your given name? Douglas: I would try to, yes, of course. ... If I were a ballet dancer, Issur Danielovitch would be a wonderful name.","Kirk Douglas, 92, recently did one-man show, ""Before I Forget""

"(CNN) -- Colin Kaepernick is trying not to get caught up in the national story that he has become -- one that landed on the cover of Sports Illustrated this week, and one that'll just keeping growing if he leads the San Francisco 49ers to the Super Bowl with a win in Atlanta on Sunday. Still, he can't help but allow himself a few glimpses into the hysteria. They usually come while sitting at the computer, looking through photos of strangers replicating his touchdown celebration, flexing his arm and kissing his bicep, in unusual places. ""I saw a girl Kaepernicking while she was riding a horse,"" he said at a news conference this week in San Francisco. Yes, it is a word now -- Kaepernicking -- just like the phenomena surrounding another quarterback unafraid to run with the football. But unlike Tim Tebow, whose celebration of kneeling in the end zone in prayer became known as ""Tebowing,"" there are plenty of reasons to think Kaepernick will have staying power in the NFL. He will start just his ninth career game against the Falcons on Sunday, with the NFC Championship on the line. But already, teams have struggled to defend against his speed as a runner and his improving accuracy as a passer. Kaepernick rushed for 181 yards, a playoff record for a quarterback, and threw with 263 and two touchdowns in a playoff win against Green Bay last week. NFL serves up barn burners . Here are seven reasons why you'll be hearing plenty about No. 7 on the 49ers, in this season and beyond: . 1. The tattoos. Might as well start here, because if you've seen a 49ers game in the second half of the season, you had to notice that Kaepernick (pronounced KAP-er-nick) has plenty of them. They were at the center of a media firestorm in December when a columnist for AOL/Sporting News wrote, ""NFL quarterback is the ultimate position of influence and responsibility. He is the CEO of a high-profile organization, and you don't want your CEO to look like he just got paroled."" His family was outraged. ""Are you categorizing this kid on something like tattoos?"" his mother, Teresa, told USA Today. Kaepernick had a 4.0 GPA in high school and is active in charities. As for the tattoos? The ones on his biceps are Bible verses, and the words across his chest say, ""Against All Odds."" Besides: Tattoos are hardly viewed negatively, especially among young people. 2. He can run. The tattoos might make people notice Kaepernick, but his playing style makes it impossible to stop watching him. Of the four quarterbacks still alive in the NFL playoffs, he is unique. Tom Brady (New England), Joe Flacco (Baltimore) and Matt Ryan (Atlanta) are all classic drop-back passers who run as a last resort. Kaepernick runs the 40-yard dash in about 4.5 seconds, which is exceptionally good for a quarterback. He doesn't want to be known as a ""running quarterback,"" a tag that has dogged several two-dimensional quarterbacks to come before him. ""When I got into high school, college, I watched Vince Young, Michael Vick a lot, (Donovan) McNabb, watched the old clips of (Randall) Cunningham,"" Kaepernick said. ""They were all quarterbacks that were mobile and could make plays."" The key is not complicated: ""Run where they're not. You want to run away from where the defensive players are. When they get close, get down."" 3. He can throw. Defenses would be unwise to dismiss Kaepernick as a passer. He has completed 62.4% of his throws this season for 1,814 yards, with 10 touchdowns and -- maybe most important for a team with a stellar defense -- just three interceptions. Plus, there's a maturity in his game. His coach, former NFL quarterback Jim Harbaugh, is impressed with his ability to shake off bad plays. ""As a quarterback and you throw an interception in a game, there's just a tendency the next time to double check things,"" Harbaugh said. ""You're double checking, then double checking. And that's not the way to do it. So you want him to be trusting what he sees and cut it loose. And I think he's shown a rare ability to not do that, to not have to double check."" 4. He has the perfect coach. Kaepernick would still be another mostly anonymous backup if Harbaugh hadn't made one of the gutsiest decisions of the NFL season. Harbaugh replaced Alex Smith, who had played well during the season and led the team to the brink of the Super Bowl in 2011, with the untested second-year pro. It wasn't just a leap of faith. In the eight quarters that preceded a concussion injury, Smith had completed 32 of 35 passes for 385 yards with five touchdowns. Think about that: He had more touchdowns than incomplete passes. Still, Harbaugh is a former quarterback who saw another dimension in Kaepernick, and one who will be able to build an offensive system around his strengths. 5. He's on a team on the rise. Good quarterbacks make their teams better, of course. But the opposite is true. Kaepernick wasn't stepping into a desperate situation when he took charge in San Francisco. He was taking over a contender. San Francisco, which lost to the Giants in the NFC championship game a year ago on a late field goal, has one of the best running backs in the game in Frank Gore (1,214 yards) and the second stingiest defense (allowing 17.1 points a game). He also has an elite young target in receiver Michael Crabtree, who caught 85 passes for 1,105 yards and nine touchdowns. Kaepernick's play is a major reason the 49ers are four-point favorites on the road, even though Atlanta rarely loses in the Georgia Dome. 6. The letter. Everyone likes a good backstory. Kaepernick has a terrific one. He was born in Milwaukee in 1987 and adopted by his parents, Rick and Teresa, who had lost two infants to a congenital heart disease. The family moved to California when Colin was 4, and quickly his talent as an athlete became clear. The kid noticed, too. He wrote a letter to himself as a fourth grader not only predicting that he'd be a quarterback in the NFL, but also that he'd play for the 49ers or the Packers. Here he is. 7. Kaepernicking. Hey, it certainly doesn't hurt, in this era, to be trending on social media. The San Francisco Chronicle asked readers to send photos of them Kaepernicking, and did they ever respond. In front of a frozen waterfall. On the top of a mountain. At Disneyland. On top of a motor home. As far as letting the hype get to him, Kaepernick said the new fame hadn't changed anything. ""I go home. I watch my film. I watch anything on TV but sports, and I go to bed and come back and do it the same way the next day."" If he wins his next game, he'll wake up as a Super Bowl quarterback. And an even bigger story.","Colin Kaepernick flexes and kisses his bicep when he scores a touchdown .

"(CNN) -- It's hard to think about global warming when it's so cold that you can't suck in the air without pain. I stepped out on my porch in Vermont this morning -- I live in an old farmhouse with a panoramic view of the Green Mountains -- and could hardly breathe. The thermometer had dipped well below zero. I heard on the local radio that it was 70 below zero on Mount Washington, in New Hampshire, taking into account the wind chill. But I'm used to cold weather, having spent most of my adult life, almost four decades, in New Hampshire and Vermont. In fact, I remember the cold snaps of old, back in the 70s and early 80s, when for weeks on end the temperature would hover around zero, maybe creeping up to 10 or 15 at noon, when the sun looked like a pale and cheerless disc in the sky. There was a strange exhilaration in those sub-zero weeks: the sense of a vacuum, a silence that amounted to noise. You couldn't inhale, as it made your lungs ache. Your nose-hairs froze and breathing was difficult. Your glasses steamed up when you stepped into any building. It was important to dress in the most thoughtful ways, with layer upon layer of clothes, including a good set of silk underwear. Earmuffs were essential, as well as big fur hats, thick gloves, insulated boots and wool socks, the works. I have a photo that I love of the old poet, Robert Frost, in a winter hat with long earflaps, in heavy boots, a stick in hand. He is walking through a snowy field not far from where I live. He often wrote poems about being alone in the woods or fields in deep snow. I think, for instance, of ""Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening"" or the ferocious ""Goodbye, and Keep Cold,"" where he says: ""Dread fifty above more than fifty below."" He's speaking to a stand of trees that seem not to mind the arctic weather, these resilient ""Maples and birches and tamarack."" I'm afraid that human beings rarely like it when it gets so cold. Only a week ago, I paid a fleeting visit to Key West, Florida, where it was almost 90 under the palm trees. Coming back to Vermont late one night, only a few days ago, I stepped from the airplane into the dark, icy weather, and I wondered how I could stand it. When I got to my car, the thermometer on my dashboard told me it was 10 below zero. And the wind howled as I drove through the dark snowy mountains to my house. Was I crazy to live in such a climate? This morning I met a friend, an elderly Vermonter, in a cafe. He said to me, ""I don't know about you, but I feel comforted by this cold snap. It reminds me of the old days, before global warming. I feel as if the world isn't completely out of whack."" I doubt the world isn't out of whack when, on Wednesday, it was colder in New York City than it was in part of Antarctica. This is imbalance on a global scale, and it doesn't provide much comfort to move through a brief cold snap. We know that vast shelves of ice are melting at the poles. We know that this past year was the hottest on record. Only those with their heads buried deep in the sand can believe that climate change is not upon us and that fossil fuels are not changing this planet in ways that will make life difficult for our children and their children. Something has to be done, and quickly, or we'll be passing along to our heirs a ghastly wreck of a planet. We will have proved dreadful and selfish stewards of this precious earth. I don't expect the cold to last, not like in the old days. Yet while it does, for a brief while, I plan to enjoy it. I'm going to bundle up tight today -- silk underwear, hat, gloves, and insulated boots -- and go for a walk in the woods, just to savor the depth of silence, the sense of a world brought to a point of absolute and unimaginable stillness. Like Frost, I will say to my Vermont neighbors with a wry smile: ""Goodbye, and Keep Cold."" I know they will smile back. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jay Parini.","A severe cold front swept across the East Coast and the Midwest this week .

"(Lonely Planet) -- From the steep slopes of volcanic Haleakala to the wealth of surf spots, Maui beckons lovers of sun, sand and surf. But venture just beyond the hotel buffet and discover what a foodie destination the Valley Island has become. Maui's culinary landscape is heavily influenced by fresh, local and 'ono (delicious) flavors. Chefs, farmers, ranchers and fishermen work together toward a sustainable future where island ingredients are the featured attraction on daily menus and reflect the agriculture and people of Maui. The Hawaiian Regional Cuisine movement started in 1991, with 12 founding chefs interested in focusing on using the freshest local ingredients to achieve the diverse flavors of island dishes. Three of those original chefs head restaurants in Maui: Mark Ellman of Mala Ocean Tavern, Beverly Gannon of Hali'imaile General Store and Peter Merriman of Merriman's Kapalua. Those and some of the founding chefs' more recent ventures -- including Ellman's newest, Honu, in Lahaina, Gannon's eponymous Gannon's and Merriman's Monkeypod Kitchen in Wailea -- are among the best places to get a sample of Maui flavor, straight from the farm to the table. Lonley Planet: Hawaii for first-timers: how to choose an island . Just like the wealth and diversity of fresh local ingredients, their availability spans beyond large restaurants to smaller establishments. Get a taste of guri-guri, a treat crossed between ice cream and sherbet, at Tasaka Guri Guri. Another sweet option is the island-style ice cream at Roselani Tropics Ice Cream, featuring local flavors such as vanilla, mango, pineapple and coffee. Home Maid Bakery's crispy manju has luscious fillings from azuki beans to coconut. Take some island style home in a bag of Maui coffee. The best place to do your shopping is on a coffee estate, where you can get a look at where your morning beverage comes from, such as MauiGrown Coffee or Kupa'a Farms. Farmers' markets and farm stands have become more than a regular shopping opportunity for locals -- they're now a common stop on a visitor's itinerary as well. Markets are an easy way to showcase Maui's farms and ranches and the food they produce. Even big-name hotels are helping lead the way in supporting local farmers by including their products in sustainable and organic menus.Â The stand at Kula Country Farms, as well as farmers' markets in Makawao, Kahului and other locations throughout Maui are ideal opportunities to see the variety of locally raised products and produce on the island -- and buy some to taste. Lonely Planet: Top 20 Hawaiian vistas . A visit to one of Maui's farms can be both fun and educational, especially when it's in Kula. In Upcountry Maui on the slopes of Mount Haleakala, the Kula area takes advantage of its rich volcanic soil and cool climate, and has been central to the island's culinary resurgence. Much of the produce you'll find on the tables of Maui's best restaurants focusing on Hawaiian Regional Cuisine is grown in and around Kula, including the sweet Maui onion. Start with a gourmet lunch tour and real farm-to-table experience at O'o Farm, an 8.5-acre natural farm operated by the Pacific'O and I'O restaurants. Milk a goat at the Surfing Goat Dairy, then see the cheese-making process before you sample some for yourself. Get an exotic walking tour through the sweet-smelling fields of Ali`i Kula Lavender, or wander the grounds of Maui's Winery at Ulupalakua Ranch -- before you wander right into the tasting room. Sustainable food on Maui isn't just about produce -- it also includes island-grazed beef and grass-fed lamb. Island ranching dates back to the 19th century, and is a large part of the local paniolo culture. The Maui Cattle Company produces meats from six ranch partners throughout the island, from Hana to the slopes of Haleakala. While every day is a celebration with island cuisine options, Maui food festivals offer an opportunity to get immersed in a particular food item, like the Maui Onion Festival or the East Maui Taro Festival. Others, like the 30-year-old Kapalua Wine & Food Festival, are multi-day culinary extravaganzas. Lonely Planet: Hawaii or the Caribbean: how do you choose? © 2011 Lonely Planet.

"New York (CNN) -- Cold air swinging south from Canada left residents from North Dakota to New York contending with severe weather that proved deadly in some areas. ""Those people who work outside have to be careful,"" CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said Wednesday. Authorities say exposure to sub-freezing temperatures left at least three people dead in Wisconsin, Minnesota and Illinois. The coldest air so far is in northwestern Quebec, where temperatures plummeted to 45 degrees below zero Fahrenheit in the city of Rouyn, according to forecasters. ""We feel the wind chill, and so do pets. You need to find some place indoors and out of the wind for them,"" Myers said. In the northern Maine town of Presque Isle, temperatures hung around 24 below. And in Grand Forks, North Dakota, residents bundled up to stave off a potentially deadly wind chill that hovered even lower -- around 33 below. ""The biggest thing is staying out of the wind. That's what kills you,"" said Michael Lannen, who works at a Menards hardware store in Grand Forks. ""It seems we get one of these kinds of weeks every year, so everyone is just trying to bundle up and stay indoors."" Share your cold weather stories, videos and images . iReport: Cold Wisconsin!

"(CNN) -- Despite access to free contraceptives, unplanned pregnancies are a rising problem for women in the U.S. military, according to a new study. Nearly 11% of more than 7,000 active-duty women surveyed by the Department of Defense in 2008 reported an unplanned pregnancy during the previous year. That's 50% higher than the average rate in the United States, the study authors say.The study, publishing next month in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology, also notes that the rate has increased since 2005. Authors Dr. Daniel Grossman and Kate Grindlay analyzed data from the 2005 and 2008 Department of Defense Survey of Health Related Behaviors, which they obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request. ""It's alarming,"" Grossman said of the increasing rate. ""When you're in the military, that's actually one time where you have access to free, good quality health care. ... It really highlights the need to better address contraceptive care."" The military offers FDA-approved contraceptives, including emergency contraception, at no cost in its medical facilities, according to Shoshona Pilip-Florea, spokeswoman for the U.S. Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery. ""It's important to note that contrary to the study, Navy Medicine has consistently found that the number of unintended pregnancies among female sailors and Marines is comparable to the national rates in the general population,"" Pilip-Florea wrote in an e-mail. Military to open combat jobs to women . The consequences . Unplanned pregnancies can have a significant impact on the health of military personnel and on troop readiness, according to the study. Servicewomen who become pregnant unexpectedly while at home cannot be deployed, which may affect their career. Servicewomen who become pregnant while overseas must be sent home, which can cost the military around $10,000. Research has shown approximately 43% of unplanned pregnancies in the United States end in abortion. ""For women in the military, that can represent a huge challenge,"" Grossman said. Federal law allows abortion to be covered at military facilities only when the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, or threatens the life of the woman. And going off-base for medical care in places like Afghanistan or Iraq can be extremely dangerous, Grossman said. Readers skirmish over women in battle . Behind the numbers . Sexual assault could be playing a role in the military's high number of unplanned pregnancies, the study authors noted. Research shows an estimated 20% to 40% of servicewomen experience rape or attempted rape during their military career. (Exact numbers are difficult to obtain; the Department of Defense estimates more than 80% of incidents are never reported.) A lack of sexual education and fears about repercussions could also be contributing factors, the authors said. In 2012, Grossman and Grindlay published results from a small online survey about the use of contraception in the military. Close to 60% of the 281 servicewomen surveyed said that contraception was easy or somewhat easy to obtain. The most common reason women cited for not using birth control while deployed was not planning to have sex. More than half of the respondents said they did not speak to a military medical provider about birth-control options before deploying. Some felt policies prohibiting or discouraging sex during deployment prevented them and/or their doctors from initiating a conversation about contraception, the study authors said. Not being able to access their preferred method of birth control was also cited as a reason for not using contraception. Vaginal rings often cannot be used due to refrigeration needs and refills of patches or pills may be delayed due to transportation issues. Like many Americans, military personnel most frequently choose the pill and condoms for contraception, Pilip-Florea said. ""These methods are much more failure-prone than long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARC) such as intrauterine devices and hormonal implants,"" she said. ""Increasing the acceptance and usage of LARCs may decrease the unplanned pregnancy rate."" Moving forward . Some branches of the military have already begun to address these issues. The Navy and Marine Corps Public Health Center created the Sexual Health and Responsibility Program (SHARP) in 1999 to help reduce the occurrence of sexually transmitted infections and unplanned pregnancies. ""Policies and programs, like SHARP, have been put in place to help minimize these barriers,"" Pilip-Florea said. ""As a result, we believe those mentioned by Dr. Grossman may exist in isolated cases but do not represent a systemic problem."" In 2012, the Navy issued a policy requiring all females to be offered contraception services immediately after receiving orders to make sure they have time to find a contraception method before being deployed, Pilip-Florea said. Navy medical facilities also have a film on the different kinds of contraceptives; the facilities will soon receive another film on the consequences of unplanned pregnancies. The Navy also plans to add a ""multi-hour, facilitated classroom lecture on family planning"" to their mandatory training after boot camp, according to Pilip-Florea. Grossman acknowledged these efforts, but said more needs to be done across all branches to provide education and access to contraception for servicewomen. ""These findings highlight an important public health problem within the military that has not been adequately addressed,"" the study authors wrote.","In 2008, there were 105 unintended pregnancies for every 1,000 servicewomen, study says .
The military offers free FDA-approved contraceptives in its medical facilities .

"(CNN) -- Worries about the Superdome's wiring led to an order for hundreds of thousands of dollars in ""emergency"" electrical repairs in the months leading up to Sunday's Super Bowl, documents show. Although there is no proof the problems were behind the partial blackout at the multi-million-dollar extravaganza, they are among the latest details to emerge in the mystery surrounding the embarrassing snafu. Power company Entergy upgraded service at the Superdome, but had ""concern about reliability"" of service from its connection point to the dome, according to a memo dated October 15, 2012. An attorney for the Superdome's managers provided the documents to CNN. The new information includes memos and meeting minutes prepared for the Louisiana Stadium and Exposition District, a state agency that oversees a group of facilities including the Superdome. An October LSED memo mentions that a firm was hired to test the secondary electric feeders at the dome. It was ""determined that the feeders had some decay and had a chance of failure."" Those same tests led an engineering firm to conclude that ""the Superdome's main and only electrical feed, based upon test results ... are not sufficiently reliable to support the high profile event schedule."" The board categorized these repairs as an ""emergency,"" according to minutes from an LSED meeting in October. By that point, the board had already approved spending up to $700,000 to replace parallel electrical power feeds. In November, the board was updated about ""the replacement of the electrical feeders that connect the Superdome to the Entergy power vault."" The board approved spending $513,250 on what the minutes referred to as the ""Emergency Feeder Repair Project."" The company confirmed it completed some upgrades to electrical delivery systems to the facility on December 21, but Entergy has said that may have had nothing to do with Sunday night's problem. The dome hosted a few major events after that work was carried out, including the Sugar Bowl. Entergy says a piece of equipment designed to monitor electrical load sensed was tripped by an ""abnormality"" and partially cut power to the stadium, as designed. The switch gear is designed to cut some power so as to isolate the problem and prevent a larger outage. LSED, Entergy and the company that manages the Superdome, SMG, said in a joint statement Tuesday that they have hired an independent third party to investigate the cause of the blackout. Entergy will continue to conduct its own investigation. The 35-minute electrical outage during the Super Bowl set off a storm of social media amusement among viewers and inspired advertising tweets with blackout twists. Carmaker Audi took a swipe at its competitor, tweeting that it was sending ""LED lights"" over to the dome, which is officially named the Mercedes-Benz Superdome. But for the picturesque Super Bowl host city -- perpetually concerned with its reputation, especially since Hurricane Katrina -- the power failure broadcast to the world was a huge embarrassment. Mayor Mitch Landrieu promised that night there would be answers soon. Opinion: Wacky, weird and wonderful Super Bowl . The council member who heads New Orleans' utility committee, Cynthia Hedge-Morrell, hopes some will be forthcoming at the meeting this week. 5 Super Bowl moments to talk about Monday . ""I am extremely disappointed in the power failure at the Superdome during last night's Super Bowl game,"" she said in a statement Monday. The NFL has said the incident will not likely diminish the city's chances of hosting another big game. The general consensus on social media appeared to be that Beyonce's high-wattage half-time performance was mostly likely to blame for the blackout. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell countered the virtual chatter, saying, ""There is no indication at all that this was caused by the halftime show, absolutely none."" The blackout triggered calls by industry leaders for the building of a nationwide smart power grid, which could reroute electricity seamlessly in such cases. This would avoid such public displays of momentary weaknesses in the system, said Andres Carvallo, former chief technology officer at Austin Energy, where he says he built the nation's first smart grid. On Monday, CBS aired video shot from inside a stadium control room as the outage occurred. ""All right, we lost lights,"" says a man as the room darkens. Funniest tweets of the #Blackout .

"(CNN) -- Get ready: The 2016 campaign for the White House is getting under way. Among those attending next week's Republican Governors Association meeting in Las Vegas are the group's chairman, Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, as well as popular Republican governors such as New Jersey's Chris Christie, Wisconsin's Scott Walker and Louisiana's Bobby Jindal. While the RGA's annual confabs are all about policy and politics, 2016 is sure to come up because all four governors are thought to be contenders for the party's next presidential nomination. Even though the 2012 election is barely in the rear view mirror, speculation over the next race for the White House is getting started. With President Barack Obama winning a second term on Tuesday, an incumbent will not run in 2016, meaning both parties may have competitive nomination battles. Biden: 'You'll vote for me in 2016' The two names grabbing the most attention in the hunt for the next Democratic nomination are Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. As he was leaving a Delaware voting booth on Election Day, Biden was asked whether it was the last time he'd cast a ballot for himself. ""No, I don't think so,"" he replied, smiling. Last month, he dropped a mention of a possible '16 bid. While on a phone call with a voter in Florida, the vice president discussed health care and insurance, making his case for the president's health care reform law. ""And after it's all over, when your insurance rates go down, then you'll vote for me in 2016,"" he said. Biden, who will be 73 on Election Day 2016, made unsuccessful bids for the nomination in 1988 and 2008. As for Hillary Clinton, it doesn't matter how many times the soon-to-be-former secretary of state says she won't run for president again, there's always speculation that she may change her mind between now and the next presidential cycle. When asked by Marie Claire magazine last month if she would make another bid for the White House, she said, ""No, I'm not."" Hillary Clinton repeats 'no' for 2016 . ""I have been on this high wire of national and international politics and leadership for 20 years,"" Clinton said. ""It has been an absolutely extraordinary personal honor and experience. But I really want to just have my own time back. I want to just be my own person. I'm looking forward to that."" But until she makes a Shermanesque statement, speculation will continue. ""The truth is, everyone else is frozen until Hillary decides what she wants to do,"" a Democratic strategist, who asked to remain anonymous, told CNN. In addition to Biden and Clinton, there are some other possibilities. Former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo did not run for the Democratic nomination in 1992, which went to Bill Clinton, but will his son, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, go where his father did not? Cuomo is up for re-election in 2014. Also possibly considering the White House is term-limited Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, the current chairman of the Democratic Governors Association. Other governors who might be considering runs are Deval Patrick of Massachusetts and outgoing Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer. And then there's the U.S. Senate, where all 100 members may imagine themselves as president. Sens. Mark Warner of Virginia, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, and even Sen.-elect Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts could be on any list of potential presidential candidates. The Democratic strategist has some advice for potential candidates: ""Everyone who wants to run for president in the Democratic Party should beat a path to Jim Messina's door. Then camp out in Iowa."" Messina was Obama's campaign manager, and Iowa, of course, traditionally kicks off the presidential primary and caucus calendar. As for the Republicans, Christie is at the top of any potential list. But before any run for the White House, the New Jersey governor next year faces what may be a tough re-election campaign in a blue state. McDonnell, who is term-limited at the end of this year and who was considered a possible running mate for Mitt Romney, may want to make a bid for the top spot. Walker is a hero to many conservatives, thanks to his battles against public sector workers in Wisconsin. After surviving a recall election this year, Walker is up for re-election in 2014. Christie: Romney 'didn't get enough votes' Jindal, who's very popular among fiscal as well as social conservatives, is also entertaining thoughts of running for president, and Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who has to decide about running for re-election in 2014, may also take a second shot at the GOP nomination. Romney's running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, returns to his leadership role in the House. Will Ryan, a favorite of fiscal conservatives and many tea party activists, make a run for the top spot in the next presidential cycle? This week's election proved that the GOP has a problem with Latino voters. Will freshman Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a GOP rock star who's urging his party to address this problem, make a run for the White House? If he doesn't, maybe his mentor, two-term former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who has strong relations with the Hispanic community, could make a bid. Rubio, by the way, will be in Iowa in a week and a half to headline an event for the state's Republican governor. Rubio isn't the only Republican senator whose name comes up. Add John Thune of South Dakota to the list. And will freshman Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky follow in his father's footsteps and run for president? Rand Paul talks 2016 prospects . The GOP is famous for awarding the nomination to the candidate who came in second in the previous primary cycle, like with Romney this time. If that's the case, then watch former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania. He gave Romney a run for his money, he's from an electoral-vote-rich state that the Republicans think they can reclaim, he's got a working-class background, and he's beloved by social conservatives. Add in two more names from the 2008 cycle: Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who performed much better than expected in the GOP primaries, and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who was her party's vice presidential nominee that year. Huckabee is still popular, thanks to his radio programs and weekly show on Fox News Channel, and Palin still commands a loyal conservative following. ""There is a vacuum of leadership right now in the Republican Party. Whoever steps up right now to point the party toward its future will help the party and advance their own fortunes politically,"" says Republican strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos. But Castellanos, who was a senior media adviser to Romney's 2008 White House bid, says don't look to the past. Wishing for a Rubio run . ""The next Republican nominee will be tasked with taking the party into the future. It won't be the old retreads. It won't be Santorum, Huckabee or Palin. We need a new Republican from the ranks of GOP governors, senators, or even Jeb Bush and (former Secretary of State) Condi Rice who still represent the GOP's future."" So what do these possible 2016 wannabes do as the very early preseason begins? If they don't have leadership PACs already, they form them, make speeches, campaign for fellow party members in the 2013 and 2014 races, write books and do cable news interviews, as they build up allies and support in the states that vote early in the primary and caucus calendar. ""This isn't a phase where people decide to run for president, it's when they start to do things that leave that door open,"" says a different Democratic strategist, who predicts that ""there will be a wide open field on both sides next time around.""","The GOP's next presidential nominee might be at Republican governors gathering .

"(CNN) -- A man suspected of abducting and sexually assaulting a Central Michigan University student posted a final goodbye a few hours later on his Facebook page shortly before an officer fatally shot him, authorities said Friday. ""Well folks, I'm about to get shot. Peace,"" was 30-year-old Eric Ramsey's last post to his Facebook wall around 3:15 a.m. Thursday, Isabella County Sheriff Leo Mioduszewski told CNN in a telephone interview. Ramsey had abducted the student from CMU's campus about 2.5 hours northwest of Detroit on Wednesday evening, then drove her to a home where he bound and sexually assaulted her, the sheriff's department said in a news release. After the attack, Ramsey put the woman back in the car, grabbed two cans of gasoline and began driving again, it said. When he told the woman he was going to kill her, she jumped from the car and ran to a nearby residence, where she knocked on the door and yelled for help, the release said. A 14-year-old boy let her in and, after hearing her story, locked the woman, his younger sister and himself in the bathroom, Mioduszewski said. As the woman was calling police, Ramsey poured gasoline on the house and set it afire before fleeing, the sheriff said. Shortly thereafter, the children's father returned home and doused the fire, which caused no serious damage, Mioduszewski said. Police soon caught up with Ramsey, who led them on a chase through two counties, during which he rammed a state police trooper's car, stole a sanitation truck and rammed two more vehicles, police said. ""It's been real, bro, wish I could have hung with you once last time. Love you, brother,"" Ramsey allegedly posted to a friend's Facebook page around 1 a.m. Thursday, as the chase was continuing. A couple of hours later, after hitting a deputy's car head-on, Ramsey posted his final words, the sheriff said. Soon after, he was fatally shot by a deputy. ""We owe it to the public to find out what was the cause of this,"" Mioduszewski said Friday. Police are meeting with friends and family to determine what was going on in Ramsey's life, he said.

"(CNN) -- French President Francois Hollande visited the Malian town of Timbuktu on Saturday, a jubilant trip days after his nation's forces freed the fabled city from the iron grip of Islamist militants. France launched the offensive against militants in its former colony three weeks ago. The ground and air campaign has sent Islamist fighters who had seized the northern region fleeing into the vast deserts. ""We are serving a cause defined within the United Nations' framework ... to bring the entire Malian territory under the legitimate authority of the Malian president and then the leaders who will be elected by the Malians,"" Hollande said in Timbuktu. French troops, he said, are not in Mali to venture into politics. Broken limbs, torn lives in northern Mali . ""I have enough to do with French politics,"" he said. ""So we are at the service of a mission which was defined from the call of the Malian president and within the framework of the Security Council resolutions."" Hollande landed in Sevare accompanied by his defense and foreign ministers, CNN affiliate BFMTV reported. From there, he joined Malian interim President Dioncounda Traore for the Timbuktu visit. French-led forces liberated the historical city this week after Islamist militants took control of it last year. In Timbuktu, residents bestowed him with a camel while others danced. What's behind instability in Mali? The trip comes as troops from both nations make major gains in the battle against militants. French-led troops now control Timbuktu and Gao cities, along with a swath in between that was an Islamist stronghold for almost a year, the French Defense Ministry said. France sent troops at Mali's request after radical Islamists seized the strategic town of Konna on January 10. The town is now back under Malian control. Islamic extremists carved out a large portion of the north last year, taking advantage of a chaotic situation after a military coup. They banned music, smoking, drinking and watching sports on television, and destroyed historic tombs and shrines in the region. World leaders feared that the al Qaeda-linked militants would turn the area into a terrorist haven. Opinion: Why Hollande must show clearer leadership . But with the offensive sending the fighters scattering, residents are once again roaming the streets without fear. France has 2,150 soldiers in Mali and 1,000 more troops supporting the operation from elsewhere. Hollande's visit comes a day after a rights group accused Malian troops of extrajudicial killings and abuses during the offensive. ""Malian government forces summarily executed at least 13 suspected Islamist supporters and forcibly disappeared five others from the Garrison town of Sevare and Konna"" in January, Human Rights Watch said. The United Nations also warned that the Tuareg and Arab civilians in Timbuktu, Kidal and Gao regions are at risk of reprisal attacks. Malian and French military officials have repeatedly called for respect of international law and human rights.

"Munich, Germany (CNN) -- Iran will give ""positive consideration"" to a renewed prospect of one-on-one talks with the United States on its nuclear program, its foreign minister said Sunday. Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi said a new round of talks between Iran and the five permanent U.N. Security Council members, plus Germany, would be held February 25 in Kazakhstan. Salehi spoke on the last day of the 49th Munich Security Conference, a day after U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said the Obama administration remains willing to hold direct talks with the Islamic Republic. ""That offer stands, but it must be real and tangible, and there has to be an agenda that they're prepared to speak to,"" Biden said. ""We are not just prepared to do it for the exercise."" The United States and Iran haven't had diplomatic relations since 1980. But U.S. and Iranian diplomats had occasional talks in Baghdad during the eight-year American war in Iraq, and U.S. President Barack Obama held out the prospect of talks with Iran when he came into office in 2009. Biden: U.S. open to direct talks with Iran . Salehi noted Sunday that both Biden and the new secretary of state, John Kerry, have mentioned the possibility of talks with Iran in recent days, and ""We take these statements with positive consideration."" Salehi said Iran has ""no red line"" for bilateral talks and is ready for negotiations over its nuclear program. But he added, ""We have to make sure this time -- and this I think is very fair of us -- to make sure the other side this time comes with an authentic intention, with a fair and real intention, to resolve the issue."" "" Iran has defied international demands that it halt its production of enriched uranium, which it insists is to be used for civilian nuclear power and research reactors. But the United States and Israel have accused Iran of seeking the capability to produce nuclear weapons, and the International Atomic Energy Agency says it can no longer verify that Iran's nuclear program is strictly peaceful. Iran's refusal to shut down its uranium enrichment plants has led to tougher and tougher economic sanctions that have crippled its economy. An oil embargo and banking restrictions have crashed the Iranian currency, the rial. New U.S. sanctions imposed in January targeted a handful of companies and individuals that Washington says are providing materials and technology to Tehran's nuclear program. Biden said Saturday that U.S. policy ""is to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon,"" and said the clerical leadership in Tehran ""need not sentence their people to economic deprivation and international isolation."" ""There is still time, there is still space for diplomacy -- backed by pressure -- to succeed,"" he said. ""The ball is in the government of Iran's court, and it's well past time for Tehran to adopt a serious, good-faith approach to negotiations with the P-5 plus 1."" During his confirmation hearing last week, Kerry told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that if Iran can prove its nuclear work is peaceful, ""That's what we're seeking."" And Obama's nominee for secretary of defense, Chuck Hagel, has in the past called for direct talks with Iran. It was a point of contention during his confirmation hearing, with some Republicans accusing him of being too soft on Iran. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, has urged the United States -- his country's leading ally -- to set a ""red line"" for nuclear development and make clear that if Iran crosses that line, it would risk war. Netanyahu, who won a new mandate in January, said Sunday that the job of preventing a nuclear-armed Iran ""is becoming more complex, since Iran is equipping itself with cutting-edge centrifuges that shorten the time of enrichment. We must not accept this process."" CNN's Chelsea J. Carter and Mariano Castillo contributed to this report.","The U.S. needs a ""fair and real intention"" to resolve the nuclear issue, Iran says .

"(CNN) -- Summer is a time when people ritualistically hit the gym to trim down for swimsuit season, working out to look good in a bathing suit. But this time three years ago, all Kit Ooraikul wanted was to be able to move again. He was struck with Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), a disorder in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the nervous system. He spent months lying in a hospital bed, watching his muscles deteriorate. Finally, his health started to improve enough for him to go into rehabilitation. In rehab, he started running. It was his way of building back the muscle he'd lost. But after he was discharged, he needed something to keep him moving. That's when he turned to RunKeeper, a fitness application that tracks, maps and records the progress of its users' running activity. ""I couldn't see myself just running on my own without some motivation tool,"" the 37-year-old said. Ooraikul is one of many people using fitness apps and sites to get in shape. More than 10 million people use RunKeeper, according to the company. It's just one example of the exponential growth of fitness apps available online and via mobile devices. From social media networks to videogame-like interfaces to health resources, technologies like RunKeeper are transforming the way Ooraikul and others approach fitness. Work out with your social network . You can be an athlete at any age. That's what Canadian Virginia Champoux said she learned from using a fitness app. Two months ago, a close friend introduced her to the app Fitocracy. It was then that she decided to be more than just active. ""I am 42 years old, I have kids and I work in retail, so I am on my feet all day. I am active. But in my 40s I told myself I was going to be fit,"" she said. ""This is the new me."" Although always on the go, this busy mom logs her daily workouts consistently. ""It works as a way to reach my fitness goals, but it also is helping me on a deeper level,"" she said. Champoux finds herself making more health-conscious decisions since starting Fitocracy. ""Last night my husband was like, 'You don't look so good,' and I was like, 'Yeah, I am frustrated, I am going out for a run' at 8 in the evening. It was either wine or running, and I choose to go for a run,"" she said. ""It's a life change."" It also keeps her diligent about her workouts. ""It is motivational and it offers me support. It's the social aspect that helps,"" she said. Fitocracy has more than a half-million users, the fitness app reports. Although that number is nowhere near those of other social networking sites, it's a dramatic growth for the niche app, which is geared toward bringing together users who share a common interest of increasing fitness and physical activity. Fitocracy started off with only a few thousand users during its beta testing days in 2011. Now, it is growing in popularity with fitness enthusiasts who use the iPhone. The fitness app functions as a social networking site with a videogame-style interface that lets users ""level up"" based on their physical activities. For Champoux, Fitocracy's social network makes the app an invaluable resource. ""It is literally a social network for working out, like Facebook for fitness,"" she said. ""It is very motivational because it allows me to work out with my social network."" The application gives her the opportunity to build relationships with others trying to meet their fitness goals. ""I have friends on Fitocracy that I have never even met,"" she said. ""People keep track of each other and it is very encouraging."" Be fit at any age . Middle age met the digital age for fitness enthusiast Karen Waldkirch. The 51-year-old Milwaukee resident was introduced to Fitocracy and Calorie Count by her son. At the time, she was on weight loss program Jenny Craig, and playing tennis occasionally, but she wanted to make sure she stayed on track. ""I knew I was going to lose the weight,"" she said. ""But I didn't want to gain it back."" By combining Fitocracy and Calorie Count, Waldkirch found resources that filled the gaps in her diet and exercise plan. Calorie Count allows her to record and monitor what she is eating, while Fitocracy works as a fitness motivator. ""It is a little extra push,"" she said. ""It is this weird dynamic that gets into your head. You are sitting on the couch, watching TV and you think, 'I better get off the couch and get some points.'"" Waldkirch says the apps she uses help her physically and mentally. ""In a funny way, it kind of enriched my life. It gave me tools to help me. It happened to come along and it really raised my self-esteem."" Although she is a relatively active person, Waldkirch says it is easy for people her age to become complacent when it comes to fitness. ""I wish people my age would look to tools like this and think, you don't have to accept your body is declining,"" she said. ""Technology doesn't have to make you lazier; it can do the opposite."" Get motivated to 'just do it' One year ago, Jason Tolentino tipped the scale at 230 pounds. It was a combination of a poor diet and eating out every day that lead him down his weight-gaining path. But one day Tolentino said to himself, ""Just do it,"" and he strapped on a pair of sneakers and ran, jogged and walked a little over five miles. ""I think what got me going was anger and willpower. I was angry at myself, and I was motivated,"" he said. He started using Nike+ as a way to monitor his physical activities. Nike+ is a fitness app that allows its users to track their physical activities, which it then displays using visually rich graphs. The app also lets users share their fitness progress with other users. Monitoring progress is a big part of why the San Francisco resident uses Nike+ consistently. ""The Nike+ app was the greatest thing that happened because it kept me going,"" Tolentino said. ""When you look at the app and you can see your progress and see that I started off at zero and I ran 700 miles, it is incredible."" But the app didn't instantly turn Tolentino's life around. ""When I first started running, I told myself and other people that if I am running I can keep eating, but that isn't how it works,"" he said. A year of complete diet change -- worked out through trial and error -- and increased fitness helped him drop the weight. ""It may sound clichÃ©, but I want to live a healthier lifestyle and inspire others,"" he said with regard to why he decided to lose weight. ""I inspired a few friends to go with me on my runs and they are also living a healthier lifestyle. At the same time, I'm unemployed and it's the best way to improve myself,"" he said. Work on a better life . The day David Eickelmann and his wife had their daughter Brianna, his life changed. His family was changing, and he wanted to change, too. He was living a sedentary life, spending many hours on the couch watching television or surfing the Internet. His lifestyle led to overeating and it started to show around his waist. Curious about calculating body fat and increasing fitness, the Flensburg, Germany, resident discovered WeightTraining.com, a website aimed at tracking its users' weight training and fitness progress while also offering video and fitness tutorials. ""I had never considered using (a fitness site) before, but when I started doing the data entry to get my body fat percentage, I became really curious about the other aspects of the site, and that was what got me started,"" he said. Easy data entry makes the site convenient for him, and it encourages him to set more personal fitness goals. His overall goal is to gain more energy for his family's sake. ""I think a large part of who we are is developed when we're young,"" said Eickelmann. ""I think that if my wife and I do a good job of presenting ourselves as positive role models in all facets of life, as my daughter goes through her childhood, being fit will become a part of her life as well."" It's not only about you . Ooraikul admits he was never a runner. He's more concerned with keeping up his endurance after GBS than becoming an athlete. And years after his hospitalization, Ooraikul says his fitness is not only about him anymore. ""It was not about returning to just a level of fitness. We just had a baby and I wanted to quickly get back to shape so that I can actively engage with her as she grows up,"" he said. Even after three years, Ooraikul still uses RunKeeper because he knows how fast life can change. ""Experiencing GBS, you find out how quickly health can disappear,"" he said. ""You should try to keep up with your levels, because you don't know when you won't be able to do the things you want to do."" When he talks about using RunKeeper, he can't help but be reminded of his time spent in rehabilitation. ""During rehab they group you with people with spinal cord injuries, and you think, 'I will get better,' because that is how GBS works, but they will not get better. They are just trying to get to a level where they can cope (with) what happened to them,"" he said. ""When you see something like that, you want to get healthier.""","Fitness apps allow people to remotely work out with their social networks .

"(CNN) -- Sergio Aguero earned Manchester City a long-awaited title in the final seconds of last season, and his manager hopes that Sunday's stunning effort against Liverpool means the 2012-13 Premier League crown is still a possibility. Second-placed City came from behind to snatch a 2-2 draw, but still ended the weekend nine points behind rivals Manchester United. Aguero netted his ninth league goal this season with a superb piece of skill, beating Pepe Reina to a throughball and then chipping a delightful shot over the goalkeeper from out wide on the right. ""Two years ago Chelsea were nine points behind and when they went to play at Old Trafford two games from the end they were only two points behind,"" City manager Roberto Mancini told reporters. ""Two games and the championship is reopened. I don't think this is finished but probably now we have to win all the games but if not then 11 or 12 games. ""Last year we recovered eight points in six games so I don't know why it can't happen this year. We have 15 games and United have to play in FA Cup and the Champions League so the season is long -- three months -- and we are confident."" Having let Mario Balotelli move to AC Milan, Mancini started with Aguero and Edin Dzeko up front, and it was the Bosnian who broke the deadlock in the 23rd minute with his 11th in the league. Dzeko was also involved in Liverpool's equalizer, as new signing Daniel Sturridge scored his fourth goal in six games despite an apparent foul by teammate Daniel Agger on the City striker. ""The referee said to play on -- he said not to kick the ball out,"" Sturridge revealed. ""It is not our job to kick the ball out. If the referee says to kick it out we will do that, and if he says play on then we'll play on. We played on and we scored."" Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard put his side head with a stunning volley in the 73rd minute, but Aguero -- whose injury-time goal against Queens Park Rangers in May ended City's 44-year wait for a league title -- embarrassed Reina soon after to leave the visitors in seventh place. ""Aguero's finish for the second was unbelievable but from our perspective we are bitterly disappointed he was in that situation,"" said Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers. ""It was a mistake, everyone is clear on that, but I can't fault the players."" Tottenham closed to within a point of third-placed Chelsea with a 1-0 victory at 10-man West Bromwich Albion on Sunday thanks to Gareth Bale's 11th league goal this season. However, it was marred by an ankle injury to striker Jermain Defoe, who will miss England's prestige midweek friendly against Brazil. Ninth-placed West Brom had Goran Popov sent off for spitting just after halftime. ""The game changed with the sending-off.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Eleven-year-old Carl Joseph Walker-Hoover liked football, basketball and playing video games with his little brother. Rep. Carolyn McCarthy says the effects of bullying are becoming more severe. But on April 6, after enduring what his mother called ""relentless"" bullying at school, Carl hanged himself with an extension cord in the family's Springfield, Massachusetts, home. ""What could make a child his age despair so much that he would take his own life? That question haunts me to this day, and I will probably never know the answer,"" Sirdeaner Walker said in a House Education and Labor Committee hearing on school bullying. ""He had just started secondary school in September, and we had high hopes,"" she said. ""But I knew something was wrong, almost from the start.""  Watch Sirdeaner Walker describe finding her son's body » . He didn't want to say at first, she said, but reluctantly told her of classmates who called him names, ""saying he acted gay and calling him faggot,"" Walker said. ""Hearing that, my heart just broke,"" she said. Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-New York, said the emotional and physical effects of bullying are becoming more severe and that the acts of bullying can continue outside school. According to the National Youth Violence Prevention Resource Center, about 30 percent of school-aged children in the United States are estimated to be involved in bullying, as either a bully or the target of a bully. Steve Riach, the founder of Heart of a Champion Foundation -- a nonprofit organization that says it offers educators an ""innovative and effective approach to developing character in the lives of their students"" -- said his organization has learned that students recognize that school safety cannot be accomplished only with security guards and metal detectors. And students ""have told us that emotional safety is every bit a concern as physical safety,"" he said. Walker called school bullying a national crisis. ""I've learned that bullying is not an inevitable part of growing up. It can be prevented, and there isn't a moment to lose,"" she said. ""We need a national solution to deal with it,"" she said.","House Education and Labor Committee holds hearing on school bullying .

"(CNN) -- The woman at the center of a scandal that led to the firing of University of Arkansas football coach Bobby Petrino resigned from her job at the school on Tuesday. Jessica Dorrell, the football program's student athlete development coordinator, had been placed on paid administrative leave after it was discovered that she had a consensual relationship with Petrino. That relationship came to light after Petrino was involved in a motorcycle crash on April 1. Dorrell, a former Arkansas volleyball player, was a passenger on Petrino's motorcycle, but he did not initially disclose that information. Through its investigation, the school learned that Petrino, a married father of four, had given Dorrell ""some $20,000"" before she was hired and failed to disclose their relationship when recommending her for the job with the department, thereby giving her ""an unfair and undisclosed advantage for a position on his football staff."" Dorrell beat out 158 applicants for the job she was hired for on March 23. ""While Ms. Dorrell had a legitimate right to apply for and accept a position within the football program, the circumstances surrounding the former coach's decision to hire her compromised her ability to be effective in such a position,"" athletics director Jeff Long said on Tuesday. ""She and I believe she should have the opportunity to move on."" Dorrell agreed she wouldn't attempt to sell or profit from her affiliation with Razorbacks Athletics, officials said. The university will pay Dorrell approximately $14,000 as part of the settlement. The school announced that there were no immediate plans to re-open or publicize the job opportunity.","Jessica Dorrell resigns her position at University of Arkansas .

"(CNN) -- The Uruguayan Ministry of Defense confirmed Sunday it has opened an investigation into an alleged assault in Haiti involving at least five Uruguayan troops deployed in the Caribbean nation as United Nations peacekeepers. The investigation, which has expanded to include a U.N. inquiry, was sparked by a cell-phone video that began circulating in Port Salut, a coastal town in southern Haiti where Uruguayan navy troops were deployed. The one-minute video, obtained by CNN, shows a young man with his shorts down being subdued by several men in military uniforms. The alleged victim is on a mattress, facing down, while several men hold his arms and hands behind his back. The uniformed men speak Spanish, but it is garbled on the tape and not understandable. At the beginning of the video the alleged victim is slapped in the face. He screams several times while the alleged perpetrators laugh. The laughter grows louder as a seemingly naked man approaches the alleged victim from behind. The young man is subsequently released and the video ends. The video obtained by CNN does not show an actual sex act. Leonardo Galante, a spokesman with the Uruguayan defense ministry, confirmed to CNN that top Uruguayan military officials have already received two internal reports regarding the incident and are waiting for results of an investigation launched by the U.N. U.N spokeswoman Soung Choi told CNN Sunday that ""the U.N. is investigating the matter,"" but would not elaborate on preliminary results or actions to be taken by the international organization. The Uruguayan defense ministry said in a statement: ""Immediately after the existence of the video became known, the Armed Forces ordered an urgent investigation. ... The National Defense Ministry has relieved of his duties the Chief of the Naval Contingent and began the repatriation of the [Armed Forces] members from Haiti."" Galante confirmed that Uruguayan Defense Minister Eleuterio Fernandez Huidobro has recalled to Uruguay the navy commander in charge of the troops being investigated. The statement did not give a date for the alleged incident or further identify the alleged victim, but some news reports have said the incident occurred in July and the man in the video is 18 years old. ""The (Uruguayan) Navy does not allow nor will it allow,"" the defense ministry said, ""that a few of its members, through these sort of unbecoming actions, erode the prestige and excellent relations with the local population [in Haiti], which have characterized the performance of the Armed Forces throughout its rich history on Peace Missions under U.N. Mandate."" According to the statement, those involved could face dishonorable discharge from the navy for unbecoming conduct and the loss of retirement rights.","A cell-phone video circulating in Haiti sparks an investigation .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama appeared on NBC's ""Meet The Press"" on Sunday, talking about the ""fiscal cliff"" negotiations and priorities for his administration in his second term. The president told host David Gregory that he was optimistic something will be worked out to keep tax rates from rising on Tuesday -- but if not, his first piece of legislation for the next Congress will be a bill to reduce tax rates on most Americans. Obama slams GOP 'priority' as fiscal cliff hours away . The president also spoke about his second term and what he wants to accomplish. Here are highlights of what he said: . Gun control after the Newtown killings . ""Something fundamental in America has to change,"" said Obama, who visited on December 16 with families of victims of the Newtown, Connecticut, school shootings. The president said Sunday he will put forth a proposal next year to change firearm laws. Among the things the legislation will address are assault-style rifles, high-capacity ammunition magazines and background checks on all firearm sales. His comments echoed those made five days after the shootings in Newtown, where a gunman killed his mother at home, then 20 children and six adults at an elementary school. Obama said he hopes that the Newtown killings spur Americans to take action and not let the shootings feel like ""one of those routine episodes,"" the emotions of which fade with memory. """"It certainly won't feel like that to me. This is something that, you know, that was the worst day of my presidency,"" he said. The president said he wanted to listen to all the parties involved in the gun control debate but was skeptical about the National Rifle Association's call to put armed guards in every school as the only solution. Obama said December 19 that a task force led by Vice President Joe Biden will have legislative recommendations in January. Benghazi attack . Obama said the security failures that led to the deaths of four Americans at the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, were ""severe,"" but he blamed human mistakes. ""There was just some sloppiness -- not intentional -- in terms of how we secure embassies in areas where you essentially don't have governments that have a lot of capacity to protect those embassies,"" he said. The State Department will implement all of the 29 recommendations by a review board headed by veteran diplomat Thomas Pickering. The FBI also has some ""very good leads"" into who carried out the September attack that killed U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three others, Obama said. Among the recommendations in the report sent to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton were strengthening security, adding fire-safety precautions and improving intelligence collection in high-threat areas. ""But we'll try to do more than that,"" Obama said. U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice . The president said verbal attacks on Rice for her comments on the Benghazi investigation were ""puzzling."" ""Of all the people in my national security team, she probably had the least to do with anything that happened in Benghazi,"" he said. Rice said on Sunday news programs in the days following the attack that it was the result of a protest against an online anti-Islam film. She was heavily criticized for those statements, to the point that she withdrew her name from consideration as the next secretary of state to avoid what she called a ""lengthy, disruptive, and costly"" confirmation process. Critics said Rice's comments were out of line with the true intelligence about the incident and were an attempt by the administration to avoid tying it to terrorism. ""Most Americans recognize that these were largely politically motivated attacks as opposed to being justified,"" Obama said. Next secretary of defense . He has yet to make a decision as to who to nominate for secretary of defense, Obama said. Sources have said they think the president will pick Chuck Hagel, a Republican, who has met with controversy since his name has been connected with the position. Gay rights groups, which were strong supporters of Obama's election campaigns, have hit Hagel for questioning in 1998 whether a nominee for an ambassadorship was suitable because he was ""openly, aggressively gay."" Obama, without calling Hagel his preferred candidate for the job, said: ""I've served with Chuck Hagel (in the U.S. Senate). I know him. He is a patriot. He is somebody who has done extraordinary work."" Hagel has apologized for those comments, Obama said. He added that he didn't see anything in Hagel's political record that disqualified him as a potential nominee. Hagel currently is the co-chairman of the president's Intelligence Advisory Board. Leon Panetta, who has been secretary of defense since July 2011, has indicated he wants to return to private life next year. Four issues for the next term . When asked about his priorities for the next four years, Obama listed immigration, the economy, energy and debt reduction. He will introduce legislation to fix a broken immigration system in 2013, he said. ""We have talked about it long enough,"" He said. ""We know how we can fix it."" Obama also wants to fix America's infrastructure. ""If we are putting people back to work, rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our schools, in part paid for by some of these broader long-term deficit reduction measures that need to take place, that will grow our economy,"" he said . And he wants to increase further the amount of energy, especially green energy, that America produces. ""We are producing more energy and America can become an energy exporter. (The question is) how do we do that in a way that also deals with the environmental challenges that we also have at the same time,"" Obama said. But the most pressing quandary is the fiscal cliff. ""It is going to be very hard for the economy to sustain its current growth trends if suddenly we have a huge bite taken of the average American's paycheck,"" he said.","President speaks to NBC for nearly 30 minutes .

"(EW.com) -- Christmas has come early for fans of ""How I Met Your Mother."" EW has confirmed that CBS' Monday night comedy is expected to return for a stunning ninth season. Though nothing's official yet, talks are thisclose with the actors and the studio, 20th Century Fox TV, to bring the sitcom back for another year on TV's most-watched network. The series from Craig Thomas and Carter Bays continues to perform well for CBS; Monday's episode averaged a 3.4 rating in adults 18-49 and 8.6 million viewers. Contracts for the actors — who include the multi-talented Neil Patrick Harris and Jason Segel, who has a flourishing film career — were set to expire at the end of the season. Deadline first reported the talks. The comedy took an exciting turn for fans on Monday when Barney (Neil Patrick Harris) and Robin (Cobie Smulders) got engaged, leaving Ted (Josh Radnor) to search for new love after eight will-they-or-won't-they-moments between him and Robin. When talking to EW about the happy couple, Thomas addressed Ted's next chapter while teasing the possibility of another year for the five best buddies. Ricky Gervais' 'Derek' trailer posted . ""There's still Ted Mosby, who is just the best friend in the world to Robin and to Barney, and he's still out there searching,"" Thomas said. ""There's definitely a 'to be continued' feeling. If Barney and Robin have gotten to the place we've always promised and are heading toward a wedding potentially, what's in store for Ted? It's a nice moment to end on. It sort of feels like a mini season finale even though it's just a midseason finale. It feels like, 'Alright now, let's see what the next — and possibly last — chapter is for Ted.' How does he move into his future if we are watching Barney and Robin move into theirs? In the way that Christmas is sort of great and a little bit sad and nostalgic and wistful — that's definitely how I feel at the end of the episode. And hopefully people will feel a feeling of resolution, in terms of waiting for Barney and Robin to reunite, but also a question left unanswered. Stay tuned for what either will be the final 10 episodes ever of the show or possibly that plus one more final season."" See the original article at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- America has spent $12 billion getting ready for the big game Sunday. Now it's time to cook the wings, prepare the dip, order the pizza, put the beer on ice. The San Francisco 49ers are favored to win their sixth NFL title, but can the Baltimore Ravens send their magnificent, but controversial, linebacker Ray Lewis into retirement with a second championship ring? Will the Baltimore defense be able to stop young quarterback Colin Kaepernick from beating them with his right arm and his legs? Who will win the battle of super siblings? Who will have the best commercial? Will it be sexy or funny? Will the halftime show be live? OK, Beyoncé assures us it will. Here are five other story lines you might be talking about around the snack table before the game kicks off in New Orleans at 6:30 p.m. ET: . 1. Some fans are 'Switzerland' Indiana Hoosiers basketball coach Tom Crean will be one of the 72,000 fans at the game. But he and his wife, Joani, and her parents won't be pulling for the Ravens to maul the 49ers or for San Francisco to knock off Baltimore. You see Joani's brothers, John and Jim Harbaugh, are the two opposing head coaches in the big game. John coaches the Ravens, Jim leads San Francisco. ""I get, 'Which brother are you rooting for?' "" Joani told the New York Times. ""I'm sure it's a joke. I'm neutral. I'm Switzerland."" In a perfect world, Jackie Harbaugh would like to see the Super Bowl end in a tie, but she and her husband, Jack, know they will have one son on Sunday night who'll be ecstatic and one who'll be melancholy. Join our Super Bowl hangout online . ""There is going to be one winner and there is going to be one who is going to be totally disappointed,"" said Jack Harbaugh, who coached for 43 years."" My thoughts go to that one that will not experience the thrill of victory. That's where our thoughts will be."" And mom and dad, married for 51 years, will be there to make things a little better. ""We're going to hug both of them and tell them how proud we are of them and their teams,"" Jackie Harbaugh said. The old coach said he was just as proud of his sons this week as he was in the days when they each told him they made the junior high or high school football team. Or when they said they earned a college scholarship -- Jim to Michigan and John to Miami University in Ohio. ""The thrill that you feel -- I know this is on a big stage -- but in parenting, those don't rank any differently,"" he said. 2. ""Reverend Ray"" inspires, draws criticism . At Pastor Jamal Bryant's church, God is on the Ravens' side. And why not? Bryant is Ray Lewis' pastor, the man who helped lead Lewis to redemption. People at the Empowerment Temple AME Church call Lewis ""Reverend Ray."" Bryant says the title fits. ""He's a jack leg preacher without a license, no Bible college, but it's just in him,"" Bryant said. ""He's spoken here a couple of times, I've put him up to do our Bible study, and he's like Billy Graham and Bishop (T.D.) Jakes wrapped into one."" Fans say Lewis' in-your-face faith and extensive community service is beautifully sincere. His critics find it phony -- a redemption tour with no true redemption. ""Redemption? Stop acting like you are one of those people that come out of the Bible,"" Greg Wilson told CNN. Thirteen years ago, Wilson's nephew, Jacinth Baker, and his buddy, Richard Lollar, were stabbed to death outside of an Atlanta nightclub. Lewis and two others were charged in their killings. Opinion: Keep dancing for Jesus, Ray Lewis! Four months later, Lewis pleaded guilty to misdemeanor obstruction of justice. A jury acquitted Joseph Sweeting and Reginald Oakley. ""It was self-defense for me because someone attacked me,"" Oakley told CNN. Today, Lewis insists whatever happened in Atlanta changed him. ""With everything I've been through in my whole life, the thing for me to be here today and my only purpose in life is to find ways to help people and encourage people and make our world a better place,"" he said. Bryant compares Lewis to the biblical figure King David. ""David was a man after God's own heart, after committing adultery, after committing murder, after being negligent on the job, after being taken out of position,"" Bryant said. ""He's still somebody who God honored, and I think that many times history can't appreciate it while you're in it, it's only after you walk away."" That is the definition of redemption, Bryant said. It's not what you've done, it's what you've become. 3. From starter to mentor . Alex Smith can't help but be a little disappointed even though the 49ers are in the game of their lives. Just a few months ago, Smith was San Francisco's starting quarterback before a concussion sent him to the sideline. Kaepernick, the second-year backup, played even better than Smith, stayed in the lineup and had a big role in getting the 49ers to the Super Bowl. He said Smith has been supportive since losing his spot. ""It means a lot,"" Kaepernick said this week. ""I think it really shows his character and the kind of man he is. He's helped me through everything, from Week 1 'til now."" The non-fan's guide to Super Bowl parties . Smith, who is healthy again, said he said he became a starter in college at Utah when their No. 1 quarterback went down. ""I'd be pretty hypocritical to be upset about it,"" Smith said. ""It's the nature of sports. He got an opportunity, stepped up and made the most of it."" NBC Sports reported this week that Smith will ask to be released in the offseason, giving him greater control of which team he will play for next. The 49ers also could trade him, or keep him, but not many teams would want to pay their backup quarterback $8.5 million. It's unlikely Harbaugh will pull Kaepernick if he struggles, but if he is injured the 49ers have little to worry about in his replacement. 4. Distractions, distractions, distractions . This Super Bowl has had more distractions than most. First there was Lewis being asked whether he had taken a banned substance called deer antler spray. Then 49ers cornerback Chris Culliver said Tuesday he didn't want any gay players on his team. Add to that the story of TV analyst Dan Marino fathering a child out of wedlock and San Francisco's Randy Moss boasting he was the best receiver of all time (to which Jerry Rice replied, ""Scoreboard."") Players were sure the media circus wouldn't affect Super Bowl XLVII. ""You get to play at this level because most of the guys are mentally tough, so when you get out there, the last thing you're going to be thinking about is what people are saying,"" 49ers center Jonathan Goodwin said. Puppy Bowl Sunday: Survival of the cutest . Ravens center Matt Birk said the being a professional football player requires staying focused at the task at hand, something some guys can't handle. He said he compartmentalizes the bad stuff, blocks it out. Patrick Willis, a 49ers linebacker, defended Culliver. ""In this business, it's always going to be something, and we know those guys,"" he said. ""We know those guys' hearts. We know that those things that come out of their mouths aren't intended to hurt anyone or intended to make it about them."" Culliver apologized Wednesday and again Thursday, saying: ""I'm sorry that I offended anyone. They were very ugly comments, and that's not what I feel in my heart. Hopefully, I can learn and grow from this experience and this situation. I love San Francisco."" 5. New Orleans on the comeback . The Big Easy is playing host to its 10th Super Bowl and even though locals are crushed that the hometown Saints aren't playing in the game, they are happy to show a city that has rebounded strongly from Hurricane Katrina seven years ago. ""We're in an economic resurrection of the city,"" actor and businessman Wendell Pierce said. ""This is a point in time that people will remember that New Orleans was on its way back. We came from total destruction and now we're hosting one of the great events known to the world."" The New Orleans Tourism Marketing Corp. says the big game served as a goal line to cross for more than $1 billion in improvements to the city. Much of that was spent fixing up the airport, where most fans will get a first impression of the city that depends heavily on tourism. New Orleans officials hope that some of the fans don't pack up and leave on Monday. After all, there's another big event going on. Mardi Gras! it's the best time ever, Pierce said. ""You're right in the middle of the greatest street party in the history of the world, Mardi Gras,"" he said. ""To have the Super Bowl join that, it's one of the most festive times to be here in New Orleans. We're going to have great food, great time and one of the greatest games in ... world sports."" 'Super Gras' a big score for New Orleans . CNN's Carol Costello contributed to this report.","There will be plenty of time to kill when you get to the Super Bowl party hours before kickoff .

"(CNN) -- A 60-foot-long whale that was discovered still breathing on a New York beach Wednesday morning is likely to die overnight, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Biologists have been closely monitoring the status of the whale since its discovery early Wednesday morning. Late Wednesday, the whale was still alive but it was ""emaciated and in poor physical condition so there is nothing that can be done to save the whale,"" NOAA spokesperson Allison McHale told CNN. NOAA is hoping ""nature will take its course"" and the whale will die overnight. If the whale is still alive by Thursday morning, NOAA plans to euthanize the whale ""humanely,"" according to McHale. The whale was first spotted by a passer-by on a morning stroll. The passer-by called 911. ""We thought it was dead when we arrived, but then it started moving,"" Nick Ecock of Point Breeze Volunteer Fire Department told CNN Wednesday. Ecock and fellow members of the fire department discovered the whale at 11 a.m. near Beach 216th Street and Palmer Place, on the north side of the Breezy Point neighborhood, a town still reeling from the damages of Superstorm Sandy. The whale was found half in the water and half in the sand, according to New York Police Department Officer James Duffy. The whale was alive but looked injured, Duffy added. ""We are keeping it wet and dousing it with water to keep it breathing,"" Duffy said. Ecock said that when biologists from Riverhead Foundation for Marine Research on Long Island arrived at mid-afternoon, they determined the mammal was a male Fin whale, the second largest species of whale. ""It doesn't look like its going to make it. It's cut up from all the shells,"" Ecock said. He added that the whale was emaciated-looking, and a biologist on the scene indicated the whale might have been sick for a while. ""It's stuck in (water) five feet deep at most,"" Ecock said. Ecock said he hoped that a four-foot sea surge expected Wednesday night due to inclement weather would help foster the whale's return to the wild. The Point Breeze Volunteer Fire Department posted pictures of the whale on social media. NOAA plans to perform a necropsy after the whale's death to determine the cause of the whale's condition.","NEW: NOAA is hoping ""nature will take its course,"" with the whale likely to die overnight .

"(CNN) -- A chorus of whoops and cheers greeted Steven Bridges and Michael Snell as they exited City Hall in Portland, Maine, early Saturday as the first same-sex couple to wed under a new law. Supporters of the law allowing same-sex marriage -- passed by a referendum in November -- jumped up and down, flashed their cameras and sang the Beatles' ""All You Need Is Love."" ""It's very surreal still,"" Snell said. The couple did not know they would be the first to take advantage of the new law. ""We finally feel equal, and happy to live in Maine,"" Bridges said. Same-sex marriage rights have been denied in many states in the past, but last month, voters in Maine, Washington and Maryland decided to change that. The Maine measure states that men and women, ""relating to the marital relationship or familial relationships must be construed to be gender-neutral for all purposes."" The measure also mentions the right of clergy to refuse to wed gay and lesbian couples if it goes against their religious convictions. The governments of Maine and Maryland had passed laws permitting same-sex marriage, but activists opposed to the laws collected enough signatures to put them on November's ballot. In 2009, a similar referendum in Maine failed when voters rejected the governor's decision to allow same-sex marriage. This year's results represent a remarkable turnaround. A similar scene of jubilation took place in Seattle this month, when same-sex couples were able to exchange vows for the first time. Newly married same-sex couples in these three states have expressed hope that the U.S. Supreme Court will issue rulings favorable to their marriages. This month, the justices said they would hear two constitutional challenges to state and federal laws dealing with the recognition of gay and lesbian couples to legally wed. Oral arguments will probably be held in March, with a ruling by late June. One appeal to be heard involves the federal Defense of Marriage Act, or DOMA, which denies federal benefits to same-sex couples legally married in their own states. The second is a challenge to California's Proposition 8, a voter-approved measure that took away a right of same-sex marriage that had been approved by the state's courts. CNN's Ben Brumfield and Phil Gast contributed to this report.","Maine voters approved same-sex marriage in November .

"(CNN) -- Rebels attacked two towns Saturday in the Central African Republic even as government officials planned for peace talks next week, authorities said. Meanwhile, opposition and pro-government militias are recruiting child soldiers as the country faces a rebellion in the north, the United Nations warned. Rebels demanding the resignation of President Francois Bozize have seized various towns and threatened to head to the capital of Bangui. The Seleka rebel coalition assaulted the towns of Alindao and Kouango in a direction toward the capital from Bambari, where they already seized control, said Josue Binoua, minister of decentralization and territorial administration. The rebels launched their offensive about 1 a.m. Saturday, said Jules Gauthier Ngbapo, a spokesman for Binoua. ""They are shouting and asking people to come out,"" Ngbapo said. ""The rebels tell civilians that they are there to protect them."" But fearful residents are hiding. The rebels sent spies on motor bikes, and then troops rode into the two towns on large vehicles, Ngbapo said. They searched for people, he said. ""Civilians are afraid, and most of them have fled the town and are now hiding in the forests, but the rebels are still patrolling the towns, waiting for the innocent people to come out,"" Ngbapo said. ""The rebels are shooting randomly, destroying properties and have been raping civilians,"" he said. CNN was unable to confirm government claims about the occupation of the towns. Meanwhile, the foreign ministers from the Economic Community of Central African States will meet Tuesday in the Gabon capital of Libreville to set an agenda for peace talks, said Placide Ibouanga Ndinga, spokesman for the Economic Community. The Seleka rebel coalition, opposition party officials, private sector representatives, U.N. officials and President Francois Bozize are all expected to participate in the talks scheduled for Thursday, said Ndinga. But officials in the Central Africa Republic questioned how peace talks could commence as rebels attacked. ""How can there be peace if the rebels are looting, raping and abducting our civilians?"" Ngbapo said. Bozize has said he will not seek re-election in 2016, Ngbapo said. As the government scrambles to quash the rebellion, alarm is growing as children are separated from their relatives. ""Reliable sources have informed us that children are newly being recruited among their ranks. These reports are of serious concern,"" said Souleymane Diabate, the U.N. children agency's representative in the nation. Diplomats seek progress on Central African Republic crisis . Armed groups are forcing children under age 18 to fight, carry supplies and serve as sex slaves, the agency said Friday. Before the conflict started last month, 2,500 children were linked to various armed groups. That number is expected to rise as the recent conflict continues, officials said. About 300,000 children have been affected by the rebellion, including family separation, sexual violence, displacement and lack of access to education and health facilities. The crisis started in December, when Seleka accused the president of reneging on a peace deal and demanded that he step down. They seized towns in the north and threatened to march to the capital, although they appear to have halted their advance. MikHey, Hey . Bozize has called on the international community, including the United States and France, to help stave off the rebellion.

"(CNN) -- Torrential rains sent rivers raging through towns in Mozambique, ripping up homes and killing at least 36 people over the past few days. Tens of thousands fleeing affected areas remain stranded without food and water as fears of a humanitarian crisis grow. ""Intense rains and flooding of the Limpopo River have affected over 100,000 people in Gaza Province alone,"" the United Nations said in a statement. At least 26 people died in that province, according to the world body. Evacuees waded through flowing muddy waters, a few prized possessions perched on their heads. Others scrambled to climb atop roofs to avoid drowning. ""In Chokwe, one of the hardest hit districts -- the normally vibrant streets now lie under water --all business brought to a standstill and social services shut down,"" the United Nations said. Preliminary information indicates at least $15 million will be needed for the relief operation.

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama blamed the fiscal cliff standoff in Congress for the contraction in the U.S. economy at the end of 2012 and weighed in on the safety of football in a pre-Super Bowl interview Sunday. During the roughly eight-minute live session with CBS host Scott Pelley, Obama said new concerns about long-term brain damage in football players ""means the game is probably going to evolve a little bit."" ""For those of us who like to see a big hit and enjoy the rock 'em, sock 'em elements of the game, we're probably going to be occasionally frustrated,"" the president said. But he added, ""We want to make sure that after people have played the game, that they're going to be OK."" Obama spoke less than two hours before the San Francisco 49ers and the Baltimore Ravens played for the NFL title in New Orleans in the most-watched event in U.S. sports. Sunday's game comes as football is under new scrutiny, with more than 1,500 former players accusing the NFL in a lawsuit of hiding the dangers of concussions from them. Another lawsuit was filed in January by the family of former linebacker Junior Seau, who argued his suicide in May was the result of a brain disease caused by violent hits he endured playing the game. Seau's brain was donated to science, and a study by the National Institutes of Health found he suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy -- a neurodegenerative brain disease that can follow multiple hits to the head. Former NFL player wants his brain studied after his death . Obama said professional players ""are grown men,"" well-paid and informed about the risks. But for players in the ""pipeline,"" from the Pop Warner leagues through college, ""I want to make sure that we're doing everything we can to make the sport safer."" The interview came four days after government figures showed the U.S. economy shrank a tenth of a percent in the fourth quarter of 2012, the first dip in more than three years. The Commerce Department said a large cut in federal spending, primarily on defense, was one of the biggest drags on growth. ""It had to do with folks being worried about the possible impacts of the fiscal cliff and what goes on here in Washington,"" Obama said. ""Washington cannot continually operate under a cloud of crisis. That freezes up consumers. It gets businesses worried. We can't afford these self-inflicted wounds."" Obama also defended his administration's decision to open positions in armed forces combat units to women and supported the Boy Scouts' move to end their national ban on homosexuals. Activists hail a watershed moment . ""The Scouts are a great institution that are promoting young people and exposing them to opportunities and leadership that will serve people for the rest of their lives, and I think nobody should be barred from that,"" he said. The White House said in 2012 that Obama -- who as president, serves as the honorary national president of the Boy Scouts of America -- disagreed with the organization's ban. It's Obama's second CBS interview in a week. The president and outgoing Secretary of State Hillary Clinton sat down for a joint Q&A with ""60 Minutes"" on January 27.","Obama says the fourth-quarter economic dip was ""self-inflicted""

"Midland City, Alabama (CNN) -- A memorial service was held in southeastern Alabama on Sunday for a school bus driver hailed as a hero. Charles Albert Poland Jr., 66, was killed last week when he tried to shield children from a gunman, who authorities say boarded a bus, shot Poland and grabbed a 5-year-old boy. The suspect and the child remained barricaded in an underground bunker in Midland City on Sunday, as the standoff stretched into its sixth day. ""I'm sad to see you gone. You didn't deserve to die, but you died knowing you kept everyone safe,"" read a letter from a student. Donny Bynum, the superintendent of Dale County schools, read the letter and several others at Poland's service, which was held at the Ozark Civic Center. ""Being on your bus has been some of the best times of my life,"" said a second letter. ""I will miss your big, smiling face,"" read a third. Poland was remembered as a loving husband, father and ""paw-paw,"" who would do anything for his grandchildren. He was the type who brought students ice water on hot days. According to authorities and witnesses, on Tuesday at about 3:40 p.m., Poland was shuttling children from school to their homes when he dropped students off and the suspect boarded the bus. The gunman demanded that Poland hand over two children. Poland refused, blocking access to the bus's narrow aisle as at least 21 children escaped out of the back emergency door, authorities said. The gunman shot Poland four times, killing him, grabbed the kindergartener and then barricaded the himself and the boy inside a nearby bunker. ""Charles Albert Poland was a hero,"" Bynum said. Read more: Late Alabama bus driver called a hero . Hot Wheels and Cheez-Its . The suspect in the case has been identified as 65-year-old Jimmy Lee Dykes, who has been described by neighbors and officials as a survivalist with ""anti-government"" views. Authorities have said little about what, if any, demands have been made by Dykes. They said there is no connection between the suspect and the child. ""We continue to maintain an open line of communication with Mr. Dykes. He continues to make the environment as comfortable as possible for the child,"" according to a statement Sunday from FBI spokesman Paul Bresson. The statement was released after authorities postponed a news conference. ""Throughout the day, Mr. Dykes has continued to allow us to deliver food, medicine and comfort items to the child. Some of those items we have delivered include a red Hot Wheels car and some Cheezits crackers,"" Bresson said. The 5-year-old suffers from Asperger's syndrome and attention deficit disorder, said State. Rep. Steve Clouse. Dykes has told authorities he has blankets and a heater in the bunker, and authorities have previously said the bunker -- built 4 feet underground -- has electricity. Negotiations are being carried out between the suspect and authorities through a 60-foot plastic ventilation pipe that leads from the bunker, authorities said. It's unclear whether Dykes has access to news reports about the standoff. ""Our mission is to resolve this situation peacefully for both the child and Mr. Dykes,"" Bresson stressed in his statement. Standoff a focal point . The standoff has become a focal point for the people of Midland City, a town of about 2,300 northwest of Dothan. Signs posted around the town and at the church urge people to pray for the boy. During a vigil Saturday outside the town hall, Michelle Riley called on Dykes to release the boy. ""He just needs to know that ... everybody makes mistakes,"" she said. ""Everybody's been through life events that changes them, but (the boy is) innocent. You know, let him go home to his mother. Let him go home to his grandparents. Let him come out to the community. Let him go back to school and be with his friends.""

"(CNN) -- Wood as a building material is having a real comeback in contemporary Scandinavian design. Bent into minimalistic circular structures and sculptural forms, it is used with surprising results thanks to engineering and technical innovations. Offering a wealth of aesthetic possibilities, timber is now being hailed as the concrete of 21st Century. Innovative architectural forms in wood was one of the central themes emerging during the World Design Capital year in Helsinki. As the planet is threatened by an ecological crisis, showcasing and promoting new eco-friendly materials was a valuable objective in the WDC program -- a topic also extended to the Finnish Pavilion at the Venice Architecture Biennale. As exhibition designer Esa Vesmanen points out: ""The young generation of architects have taken up wood with an innovative approach, thinking about all its possibilities from a new perspective."" In Helsinki, at the Aalto University architecture school, a studio in timber design offers students the possibility for a particular focus. A Summer Pavilion for the World Design Capital events was created by a team of students from an initial concept designed by Pyry-Pekka Kantonen. ""As a living material, wood is both challenging and inspiring,"" Kantonen says. The fact that wood is the most eco-friendly building material is an obvious reason for its use, but as Kantonen explains its aesthetic qualities are being rediscovered and appreciated again. In public buildings, such as the Kilden Theater and Concert Hall in Kristiansand in Norway wooden surfaces have been cleverly used for psychological effects. Juha Gronholm from the Finnish architectural studio ALA explains that the concert hall was conceived to feel as a musical instrument in itself. The undulating form of the ceiling was built from local oak based on traditional boat construction principles. Such a formal solution would have been impossible to make out of any other material. In a similar way the Kamppi Chapel of Silence is an example of exquisite craftsmanship in the treatment of timber. Erected in one of the busiest areas in Helsinki the chapel looks like a giant wooden bowl that has accidentally landed in the heart of the city and feels almost like a piece of conceptual art -- architecture with spiritual and intellectual connotations -- as sacred buildings should, of course. Its setting is unusual and its circular form radically breaking traditional models of architecture. In Nordic countries and in the Balkans, wood has always been part of the architectural heritage. Weekends and holidays are still spent in waterfront log cabins and wooden cottages, but due to safety regulations -- and a disdain towards traditional materials in the 1960's -- its use diminished in family house building. Wood has been perceived as a modest material. A sense of simplicity and truthfulness is still associated to all timber constructions. In a world where our ecological footprint is continuously considered, the reality of wood being the new concrete looks plausible indeed. Not only does wood absorb the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, it also stores it in its finished form. The entire lifecycle of wood from construction to recycling benefits the planet from an ecological perspective. In countries where wood is a natural resource buildings made out of timber make perfect sense. ""It would be crazy not to make the most of a material, which is renewable and responds to serious environmental threats,"" Kantonen says. ""Producing concrete and steel takes huge amounts of energy."" He also believes that wooden buildings will attribute to a better society where people are more tolerant and open towards each other: .

"(CNN) -- Second seed Rafael Nadal was sent crashing out of Wimbledon, as he was beaten in five sets by unknown Czech player Lukas Rosol. Rosol, ranked 100 in the world, sealed the biggest win of his life to record one of the biggest shocks in Grand Slam history. He worried Nadal in a gruelling first-set tie break, but when Nadal held his nerve to win, it looked as though normal service would be resumed. But Rosol fought back to win 6-7 (9-11), 6-4, 6-4, 2-6, 6-4 in three hours and 18 minutes and become the lowest-ranked player to beat Nadal in a Grand Slam tournament. Nadal has not lost a Grand Slam match at the second round stage for seven years, and Rosol looked as surprised as everyone, as he described the win as ""a miracle."" Even so, Nadal was outplayed as Rosol controlled the game throughout and kept his nerve as the pressure grew throughout against a player with 11 Grand Slam titles to his name. Fourth seed Andy Murray, in the same half of the draw as Nadal and Rosol, was also given a stern test by big-serving Croat Ivo Karlovic before winning through to the third round at Wimbledon. The 6ft 10in Karlovic made it an uncomfortable afternoon in the heat of Centre Court for British number one Murray. Murray edged the first set 7-5 but wasted a couple of passing opportunities in the second set tie break as Karlovic levelled. But the Scot responded well, winning the third set 6-2 in just 33 minutes before surviving another tie break to win through in four sets in three hours and 27 minutes. The look of relief on Murray's face when victory was confirmed told the story of the game -- and that feeling was echoed all around Centre Court, as Murray left to a standing ovation. ""Winning is all that matters,"" Murray said. He added: ""He's a tough opponent and there are very few who play like him."" Murray will meet Marcos Baghdatis in the third round after his Cypriot opponent Grigor Dimitrov retired through injury when trailing 7-5 4-1. Another home player in fine form was British number two James Ward, who took 10th seed Mardy Fish all the way in a gruelling five-set match. Fish won the first set before being pegged back and saw a match point go to waste in the fourth set before Ward took it on a tied-break. But Fish broke his young opponent's serve -- and his brave resistence -- midway through the fifth to seal a 6-3 5-7 6-4 6-7 (3-7) 6-3. Argentine Juan del Potro also won in four sets as he saw off Go Soeda 6-2 6-3 1-6 6-4 on Court 18.","Second seed Rafa Nadal beaten by unknown Czech player Lucas Rosol at Wimbledon .

"(CNN) -- Super Bowl XLVII ground to a halt early in the third quarter Sunday night, when about half of the lights in the Superdome went out. Lights in the New Orleans stadium's upper tier went dark with the Baltimore Ravens leading the San Francisco 49ers 28-6, minutes after the Ravens' Jacoby Jones ran back the kickoff that opened the second half a record 108 yards for a touchdown. About 10 minutes later, an announcement inside the Superdome indicated that the lights would be restored ""momentarily."" A short time later, lights began coming back on incrementally. Beyonce lights up the halftime show before lights go out . During the outage and the slow restoration of lights, players stayed on the field, talking to one another and stretching, waiting for play to resume. Spectators largely followed requests to remain in their seats. Jeff Darlington, a reporter for the league-funded NFL Network, tweeted out a picture showing ""the outside lights ... completely out. Very, very eerie."" A spokesman for Entergy, the utility that powers the Superdome and much of the area, said the problem was confined to the stadium itself. ""We are providing power to the dome,"" said Entergy spokesman Philip Allison. ""Power in (the rest of) New Orleans is fine."" Play finally resumed at 8:10 p.m. (9:10 p.m. ET), about 34 minutes after the last play according to CBS, which broadcast the game. The NFL subsequently issued a brief statement that acknowledged the problem but did not say what happened: ""Stadium authorities are investigating the cause of the power outage."" Superdome spokesman Eric Eagan, meanwhile, was even more succinct, saying, ""We sincerely apologize for the incident."" Whatever the reason, the restoration of the lights seemed to energize the 49ers. In about 10 minutes on the play clock, the 49ers notched three scores -- a 31-yard touchdown reception by Michael Crabtree, a 6-yard touchdown run by Frank Gore and a 34-yard field goal by David Akers -- to tighten a once-daunting gap and make the score 28-23 at the end of the third quarter. Twice in the fourth quarter, San Francisco had chances to pull even or go-ahead. The first was a 2-point conversion attempt that could have tied the score 31-31, but failed. Then, with about two minutes to go, the 49ers had four chances to score a go-ahead touchdown from inside the 10-yard line. That didn't happen either.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- A woman without hope when the weekend started, Theresa Nash snuggled with her two sons Ben and Henry in Atlanta on Sunday, overwhelmed at how quickly things had changed. Both boys hugged their favorite stuffed animals: Henry clutched a red hippo and Ben, a teddy bear in a blue T-shirt. ""It is by the grace of God and all the people in this country and all the angels in heaven and all the people praying ..."" Nash told CNN's Don Lemon, launching into a list of folks who helped bring the 10-day ordeal to an end. The two boys were found Saturday evening in Austin, Texas -- about 950 miles west of their hometown of Roswell, an Atlanta suburb -- after a man who had been watching CNN's coverage of the case called police. Their father Daniel Cleary, is in police custody. He will be charged with interstate interference with custody, a felony, and extradited back to Georgia, according to Roswell Police Lt. James McGee. Nash said she didn't know why her estranged husband did not bring the boys home as planned Wednesday from a trip to Tennessee that began December 19. She told CNN affiliate WSB-TV that she had not heard from him since December 22. Henry -- at 8 years old, the younger, but more talkative of the two bothers -- said he had no idea people were worried about them. Cleary had told them their mother was in the hospital, Nash said. Police first issued an Amber Alert for the suspect and his two sons on Thursday, eight days after they were last seen in Georgia. ""Suspect & children are believed to be traveling in a 2002 silver Jeep Grand Cherokee ... traveling on west side of Nashville, TN, on Interstate 40,"" the alert stated. The next day, authorities released pictures of the father and his two boys taken from surveillance cameras December 23 and December 24 at a Walmart in Jackson, Tennessee. Still, they didn't know exactly where they were. That is until Saturday evening when a person at the Crossland Austin West hotel in Texas, who had been watching CNN, recognized the Cleary brothers and called 911, said Austin police Lt. Wuthipong Tantaksinanukij. Around the time her estranged husband was being taken into custody, Nash got a call from a man who said, ""I'm sitting here with your two sons."" Asked if it was the best thing she had ever heard, ""Oh my goodness,"" she said. Unaware of how worried everyone was, Henry, who celebrated his birthday on Saturday, bragged about how he'd been kicking 9-year-old Ben's butt on iPad games. There will be more games to play. Nash got an Xbox for the boys for Christmas. There was also a remote-controlled helicopter under the tree. Following a quick trip to Texas to pick up the boys, Nash was back home Sunday, marveling in how quickly hopelessness had turned to thanksgiving. ""We will be eternally grateful every minute of our lives for the rest of our life,"" she said. ""(I'm) more grateful than I ever could have thought possible.""

"(CNN) -- Leading figures in the world of soccer, including superstar David Beckham, on Thursday blasted FIFA President Sepp Blatter for controversial remarks he made on racism in an interview with CNN World Sport. The head of world football told CNN's Pedro Pinto there is no on-field racism in football and that any player who has been abused should simply shake hands with his opponent at the end of the match and move on. Manchester United's Rio Ferdinand, a former England captain, expressed his outrage on Twitter, blasting Blatter's comments as ""so condescending it's almost laughable."" ""I think the remarks were appalling, personally,"" Beckham said in an interview with CNN's Paul Vercammen. ""All I care about is keeping racism out of soccer and out of sport. Because it's not just in sports it's in life in general. So it has to be stopped and we're part of that."" Beckham, who plays in the United States for LA Galaxy, said something should be done, but he stopped short of saying Blatter should step down. Pedro Pinto: My crazy day with Sepp . The chief executive of England's Professional Footballers' Association, Gordon Taylor, told CNN that Blatter should quit. ""He should step down,"" he said. ""This is the straw that broke the camel's back. We need football to set a good example, so this is inexcusable. The Swiss was re-elected unopposed as the head of football's governing body in June after his main rival was suspended amid corruption allegations. The bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups was also dogged by bribery allegations. Soon after Blatter gave his interview to CNN on Wednesday, his position appeared to be undermined when the English Football Association charged Liverpool's Luis Suarez with racism toward a fellow player. Suarez allegedly taunted Manchester United's French defender Patrice Evra. Suarez, from Uruguay, denies the claims. London's Metropolitan Police are also investigating allegations of racism against Chelsea and England captain John Terry. He denies claims he racially abused the brother of Rio Ferdinand, Anton, during a Premier League match. Blatter: No on-field racism in football . The UK sports minister Hugh Robertson echoed calls for Blatter to quit. ""Racism is a criminal offense in this country and anybody who is caught will face criminal sanctions,"" he told CNN. ""What Sepp Blatter has said, in this country, is just completely wrong as well as morally indefensible. This is the latest episode that calls into question whether this man should be the head of world football. For the sake of the game, he should go. ""We have been consistent in our calls for improved governance at FIFA and this underlines the need for that once more. We must never be complacent in our efforts to tackle racism. There is no place or excuse for it either on or off the pitch."" The ""Kick It Out"" group, who campaign against racism in football, said Blatter's comments were worryingly out of touch. ""Shaking hands to compensate for a racial slur is not what the game has signed up to, and trivializes the work of campaigns like Kick It Out."" Blatter clarified his comments in a statement on FIFA's website that carried a picture of him embracing Tokyo Sexwale, a prominent South African politician who has campaigned against racism. Ferdinand responded to the picture on his Twitter account, saying: ""Fifa clear up the Blatter comments with a pic of him posing with a black man..I need the hand covering eyes symbol!!"" Blatter comments spark Twitter fury . Thursday, Blatter responded to Ferdinand directly on Twitter, writing: ""The 'black man' as you call him has a name: Tokyo Sexwale. He has done tremendous work against racism and apartheid in Africa. ""We have done several joint activities to raise awareness on the struggle against racism in South Africa. FIFA has a long standing and proud record in the area of anti-discrimination which will continue."" Later Ferdinand replied: ""To say what you said about racism in football spoke volumes of your ignorance to the subject. If we want to stamp out racism in society a football pitch is a good place to start -- loved by billions of people around the world (sic)."" In an exclusive interview with CNN, Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore said racism was still prevalent in football, but the top tier in the English game was fighting hard to eradicate it. He said: ""Racism certainly still exists in football, albeit reduced, but there are still issues, of course there are, and we're not complacent about that. ""But I think it's a bit of a stretch to say it doesn't exist because it does."" ""The English game had led and been at the forefront of reducing incidents of racist behavior -- it's totally unacceptable, everybody in the game in England understands it is totally unacceptable. ""We have that reputation, as far as I'm aware, that reputation is still intact but the game will deal with whatever is thrown against it. There is no place for it in football, let alone in England, and we will strive to eradicate it."" Sports journalist and London Evening Standard columnist Mihir Bose said Blatter's views demonstrated that he is out of touch with the modern game. He told CNN, ""This won't topple him. It will damage him further but you could argue he was damaged goods anyway. ""Blatter wants to be a showman, he wants to be in the public eye ... but these comments are incredibly insensitive and crass."" Bose said that although great strides have been made in the fight against racism in football, there is still much work to do. ""Much of the racist attitudes that saw bananas being thrown onto the field at black players has gone, but there is still a pervasive racism,"" he added. ""White players feel racism has been conquered but there remains a feeling of discrimination in the game which is why black players have reacted with outrage at Blatter's comments. ""They feel there is still not a level playing field -- they feel all they have fought for over the years has been devalued."" Can European soccer stamp out racism? There have also been several instances of racism in European football this year. Former Brazil player Roberto Carlos walked off the pitch during a game in Russia when a banana was thrown at him and Chelsea's Israeli midfielder Yossi Benayoun was taunted during a game in Malaysia.

"(CNN) -- Robin van Persie and Javier Hernandez began 2013 as they ended the old year by grabbing two goals apiece as Manchester United won 4-0 at Wigan Tuesday to stay top of the English Premier League by seven points. Mexico's Hernandez, who scored the crucial Boxing Day winner in the 4-3 victory over Newcastle, grabbed the opener and the third for United at the DW Stadium. Van Persie, the key summer signing for United, made it 19 for the season for his new side, with 16 coming in the EPL, the leading tally. Hernandez, taking his share of responsibility in the absence of the injured Wayne Rooney, tapped home a 35th minute opener after Ali Al Habsi saved from Patrice Evra. Dutch ace van Persie scored the second eight minutes later, fielding a pass from Hernandez before curling the ball home. Hernandez added a third just after the hour mark with a neat finish before van Persie took advantage of slack defending with two minutes to go. It was United's eighth win in their last nine EPL matches and manager Alex Ferguson is delighted by his new acquisition. ""Van Persie's first goal was magnificent. We expected him to be a major player and add something to us, and that's exactly what he's done,"" he told BBC Sport. Defending champions Manchester City kept pace with a 3-0 home win over Stoke City, with Pablo Zabaleta, Edin Dzeko and Sergio Aguero on target against a team who had been on a 10-match unbeaten run. But Argentina's Aguero limped off with a hamstring injury after converting a second half penalty. He is likely to be sidelined for about two weeks, said the club. Tottenham Hotspur continued their recent strong run with a 3-1 home win over struggling Reading. Pavel Pogrebnyak gave Reading a surprise fourth minute lead but Michael Dawson canceled it out five minutes later. Togo star Emmanuel Adebayor and American international Clint Dempsey scored in the second half as Spurs went a point clear of Chelsea, who are at home to QPR Wednesday. In other matches, Aston Villa put a half to their alarming slide with a 2-2 draw at Swansea, the home side grabbing a point through Danny Graham's injury time equalizer. Dimitar Berbatov scored the opener as Fulham returned to winning ways with a 2-1 win at West Bromwich Albion in the early kick off, while West Ham saw off Norwich 2-1. Arsenal, who hit seven at home to Newcastle last Saturday, could not repeat the magic at Southampton where they were held 1-1 in the late kick off. Gaston Ramirez took advantage of poor defending to put the Saints ahead in the 34th minute. Theo Walcott, who scored a hat-trick in their big win, took the free kick which led to a Guly do Prado own goal before half time, but Arsenal could not force a victory and lost ground in the race for a Champions League place.","Manchester Utd beat Wigan 4-0 to stay seven points clear in EPL .

"(CNN) -- Scott Jamieson knows all about struggling in golf's lower echelons, but the Scotsman has been living the dream in the past month. He won his first European Tour event at the rain-shortened Nelson Mandela Championship in December, earning a place at another South African tournament -- this week's Volvo Golf Champions. The 29-year-old will take a five-shot lead into Sunday's final round at Durban Country Club, knowing that even greater opportunities await if he can hold off the likes of major champions Louis Oosthuizen, Padraig Harrington, Paul Lawrie and Ernie Els. Another victory will earn him a place at next month's Accenture Match Play in Arizona, which would be his debut appearance in a World Golf Championships event. Having started this week at a career-high 100th in the world rankings, it would also push him closer to the top 50 and his first outing at the Masters in Augusta in April. It's a far cry from his early days as a professional, slogging around minor circuits before finally making the step up to the European Tour in 2011, making the top 60 on the money list in his first two seasons. ""I was just in the abyss, so I guess slumming around in the lower leagues helps build your character,"" said Jamieson, who was an amateur at Augusta State University before turning pro in 2006. ""I was fortunate to keep playing when money was not necessarily being chucked at me."" On Saturday he carded a four-under-par 68 to move clear of 2010 British Open champion Louis Ooosthuizen (74), Thailand's Thongchai Jaidee (73) and France's world No. 187 Julian Quesne (67). ""It was another great day. I didn't play as well as I did the first two days, especially tee-to-green, but managed to score well and that's the main thing,"" Jamieson said. Read : Colsaerts' driving length stuns rivals . That chasing trio ended the day tied for second on 10-under 206, two shots clear of three-time major winner Harrington (67) and Ryder Cup winner Francesco Molinari (68). Jamieson's compatriot Lawrie, the 1999 British Open winner, was tied for seventh on 209 with Ireland's Shane Lowry and Englishman Danny Willett after all carded 70. Els, the current holder of the coveted Claret Jug, was tied for 11th on 211 in a group also including defending champion and fellow South African Branden Grace. Meanwhile, rookie Russel Henley took a two-shot lead at the halfway stage of the PGA Tour's Sony Open in Hawaii. The 23-year-old shot his second successive seven-under 63 on Friday to move ahead of fellow Americans Scott Langley (66) and Scott Piercy (64) at the $5.6 million tournament in Honolulu. Henley's playing partner Langley, also making his debut on the U.S. circuit, had led after a first-round 62. Dustin Johnson, who won the wind-hit season-opening Tournament of Champions at Kapalua on Tuesday, pulled out after nine holes of his second round due to illness.","Scottish golfer Scott Jamieson leads Volvo Golf Champions tournament by five shots .

"(CNN) -- It has been four years since Tiger Woods won a major title, but the former world No. 1 insists he still has time to beat the record held by his hero Jack Nicklaus. The ""Golden Bear"" won his last major at the age of 46, six years after his 17th triumph -- and Woods, stuck on 14 wins, says he plans to play for just as long. ""Absolutely. With the fitness routine and eating properly and staying in shape I could play for a very long time and I'm looking forward to that opportunity,"" the 36-year-old Woods told CNN's Living Golf in an exclusive joint interview with his heir apparent, Rory McIlroy. ""If you say hypothetically 10 years, that's 40 more major championships I get a chance to play in and compete in and try to win, and hopefully I can try to at least win five of those."" Woods, McIlroy 'too tired' for $7M Chinese tournament . Woods ended a long wait for a title of any kind in March, won again in June, and overtook Nicklaus on the all-time PGA Tour list with his third victory of the season in July. It was his 74th overall, putting him behind only Sam Snead's 82. However, over the the last four years Woods' best finish in a major was 11th, and he has been plagued by constant questioning about his ability to follow up his last win at Torrey Pines -- which came at the cost of a serious knee injury that sidelined him for several months. ""Every press conference I go to I get hammered -- 'Oh you're never going to win again blah blah blah' -- and it was every tournament I went to,"" said Woods, who ended 2012 second on the PGA Tour money list behind McIlroy with more than $6 million in earnings. ""It was a lot there for about a year and a half where I had to answer that question every single round, pre-tournament, and to do that all a lot and then to pass Jack on the all-time win list this year and do it 10 years younger than him, I think that's a pretty neat accomplishment."" McIlroy beats Woods in chaotic 'Duel of Jinsha Lake' This year McIlroy won his second major, the PGA Championship in August, at the tender age if 23 -- slightly younger than when Woods won his second at the same event in 1999. ""I'm halfway there to the career slam,"" McIlroy said. ""I've won two, and when I get my third I want to try and get my fourth. ""It's never been something that I've put a number on -- obviously I looked up to Tiger so much as a kid and obviously he's always had that goal of trying to surpass Jack's number and maybe one day I'll think about it a little more and try and put a number on it, but right now I'm at two and I want to get to three. ""I think the next big goal for me is if I could win the career gland slam, it would be a huge point. Not many players have done it in the past and it would be great to add my name to that list."" Will McIlroy join Tiger at Nike in $20M a year deal? At the peak of his powers, Woods held all four major titles after 2001's Masters victory -- three of them coming in the previous season. It's the closest any golfer of the modern era has been to a calendar grand slam -- a feat only achieved by Bobby Jones in 1930 when two of the tournaments were amateur championships. ""It was just the best run of golf that was ever seen,"" McIlroy said of Woods' achievement -- known as the ""Tiger Slam."" ""Holding all four major championships at the one time is incredible,"" added McIlroy. ""It is probably just a pity that it didn't all happen in the one year because I am not sure that would ever happen again."" McIlroy and Woods were both criticized for missing the World Golf Championship event in China immediately after their ""Duel on Jinsha Lake"" exhibition last week, citing fatigue in a busy end to the season. But McIlroy insisted his biggest challenge is to avoid burnout. ""One of the biggest things for me is longevity. I have still got a lot of years ahead of me. I just don't want to be burnt out,"" he said. ""I don't want to get to the stage where I am 30 or 35 years old and I ... I don't want to say fed up with the game, but it is a long time to be playing the sport and I just want to pace myself. ""I think Tiger has done that so well for the last 15 years and that is something that I am going to try to do going forward."" Scott: 'McIlroy can dominate like Tiger' Woods said he fully understands the pressures McIlroy is facing as one of golf's biggest drawcards, having blazed that trail himself for more than a decade. ""Everyone is going to be trying to bring you to their event, deter you away from time that is spent practicing,"" said the American. ""How did you get there? You didn't get there by sitting on your butt the entire time, you got there by working hard and doing all the things you need to do to prepare, and people are going to be trying to take you away from that. ""So trying to manage one's time -- for me that has been the biggest key. ""Some guys they just show up and they try to practice just for the week and build themselves into it. I would much rather practice at home, be ready. ""When I go to an event it is to win, period. I learned that at a very early age.""","Tiger Woods tells CNN he plans to play long enough to break Jack Nicklaus' record .

"(Financial Times) -- Spanish and Italian bond and stock markets tumbled on Monday, bringing a months-long rally to an abrupt halt as investors pulled back amid a political storm in Madrid and as Silvio Berlusconi staged an electoral fightback in Italy. Yields on Spanish sovereign debt suffered their biggest one-day percentage jump since September as the row over slush fund allegations engulfing Mariano Rajoy, Spanish prime minister, and his party rattled investors. Mr Rajoy over the weekend denied allegations first made in El PaÃ­s that the prime minister's centre-right Popular Party operated a slush fund from which it paid money to senior party leaders, including Mr Rajoy himself. But with Spain's opposition party calling on Mr Rajoy to resign as prime minister over the allegations, the country's benchmark 10-year bonds on Monday rose 23 basis points to 5.44 per cent. Yields move inversely to prices. The scandal in Spain dominated a joint news briefing in Berlin with Mr Rajoy and his German counterpart, Angela Merkel. The Spanish leader insisted once again that the slush fund allegations were false. Mr Rajoy also sought to dispel fears that his government would be weakened by the scandal -- and may find it harder to push ahead with economic reforms and austerity measures. ""I have the same desire, hope, strength and courage than when I arrived,"" he declared. Ms Merkel said the Spanish government had the ""full trust"" of Berlin in its effort to end the five-year economic crisis. The unease over Spain rippled across the eurozone, however, with benchmark German Bund yields falling as investors sought havens. Yields on Italian 10-year bonds rose 14bp to 4.47 per cent as nervousness grew over the outcome of Italy's general election. There was concern over opinion polls showing that Mr Berlusconi's centre-right coalition was narrowing the gap on the ruling centre-left and that the February 24-25 vote could lead to political instability. Italy's FTSE MIB stock market tumbled 4.5 per cent as banking stocks came under pressure. Shares in Italy's largest bank by assets, UniCredit, and Monte dei Paschi di Siena, Italy's third-largest bank which is at the centre of a widening scandal over the use of derivatives, both fell heavily. Analysts said the re-emergence of Italy's former prime minister had raised concerns about the outcome of the national elections. Silvio Peruzzo of Nomura said ""the risk of ungovernability remains very high"" amid signs that no outright winner could emerge from the February vote. ""This is a recipe for instability and could be a catalyst for uncertainty in the market,"" he said. Analysts said news from Spain and Italy had captured investors' attention and was feeding into underlying concerns over how long the markets rally would last and whether it was due a correction. ""It follows a period where peripherals have been performing well and there has been a level of caution about the extent to which that rally would last,"" said Jamie Searle, a fixed-income strategist at Citi. ""The market is looking at the political tension and asking whether this could be the catalyst for a change in direction."" © The Financial Times Limited 2013 .","Spanish, Italian bond, stock markets tumbled Monday, bringing rally to an abrupt halt .

"(CNN) -- Steve Reeder says it's no secret among his Facebook friends: He's a Republican. But after he began posting news articles and political cartoons on his page that reflect his support for GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, his friend count began falling off. Today, it's down by several dozen. ""One day, they are there. The next day, they just disappear,"" said Reeder, 53, of Roswell, Georgia. ""Most (people) don't say anything to me about it. So I just say 'good riddance.'"" It's a story that's been playing out on Facebook and Twitter with growing frequency among friends, family members, colleagues and acquaintances as an already contentious presidential campaign between Romney and President Barack Obama enters its final, frenzied weeks. Your close friends may share your political views, but that eccentric uncle, former co-worker or high school classmate may not. Nearly one-fifth of people admit to blocking, unfriending or hiding someone on social media over political postings, according to a recent survey by the Pew Research Center's Internet & American Life Project. The biggest gripes: The offending person posted too often about politics, disagreed with others' updates, or bothered mutual friends with partisan political postings. ""In the real world, we navigate these issues all the time. We know not to bring up politics around certain friends or family members. We try to avoid people who are constantly looking for an argument or trying to sell us on their pet ideas,"" said Aaron Smith, a Pew research associate. ""Since blocking, unfriending, hiding people is the closest social analogue to those real-world examples, it's not necessarily surprising to see people taking these steps in the virtual space."" Etiquette 101: Talking politics over Thanksgiving dinner . Muting the rhetoric . It's the hateful tone of the political conversation that is particularly disturbing to Luis Stevens, who has temporarily muted the Twitter voices of roughly 150 people and blocked more than 400 others until after the November 6 election. More than one person has threatened to show up on Stevens' doorstep after he disagreed with them on Twitter. A few more have called him names. And at least one stepped across a political ""red line,"" endorsing a pundit that Stevens finds offensive. ""This is a pretty mercurial campaign on both sides. People on both sides tend to get heated pretty fast,"" said Stevens, 37, of Ruidoso, New Mexico. As a result, he said, ""there are way too many people on Twitter who are a little scary."" Stevens tweets under the pseudonym @pettybooshwah. He doesn't post pictures of himself, nor does he release details about his whereabouts. But he's not shying away from political debate. ""When you don't follow people with the opposing viewpoint, Facebook and Twitter can become an echo chamber where everybody agrees,"" Stevens said. 'Facebook is not a democracy' But that's just fine with Andre Kelly, who took to Facebook in recent weeks with a posting decrying political opposition on his page. Simply put: For Kelly, Facebook is not a democracy. ""This is not about platforms and political theory, from this point forward, to me, it's about people simply picking a side,"" Kelly, an Obama supporter from Los Angeles, said in a Facebook post shortly after the Republican National Convention in late August. He warned off supporters of Romney from posting on his page, writing that he was ""simply NOT having it."" Since then, Kelly's post has been repeatedly shared, finding a home on pages across Facebook's political and not-so-political discussions. ""This was amazing and I loved every second. I'm glad he took the time to think and word this the way he did. I believe and agree with this 100%,"" wrote one admirer. Kelly, who works as a touring comedian, hasn't defriended anybody on his Facebook page, though he believes he has probably lost a few social-media followers. Tricky politics of political discourse in the workplace . Battling allegations . The political divide on social media has become so wide that some people have been trying to silence one another. On Twitter, conservatives have accusing liberals of trying to squelch their voices by falsely reporting them for spam, a violation of Twitter rules that can result in the suspension of an account. Liberal groups, meanwhile, have accused conservatives of using #block/report to shut them down. The battling allegations have led to competing blog posts that offer some of the same advice. Liberty Chick, a columnist for conservative site Breitbart.com, encouraged users to report suspected abusers, while Charles Johnson of left-leaning blog Little Green Footballs said he would continue to tell his followers ""to block and report"" those who harass them. However it's used, Twitter has clearly become a key destination in the national discussion. Twitter said a record 10.3 million tweets were sent during the first presidential debate last week, making it he most tweeted-about event in U.S. politics. And for people sick of politics poisoning their feeds, there are Facebook pages such as ""Nobody Cares About Your Political Posts. Really,"" where users can vent their frustrations. The page promises to be ""Open to all conservatives, liberals and moderates who are tired of the constant stream of political posts on FB. Doesn't mean that your views are not important -- just means that it isn't important to us to hear you blather on. P.S. You do realize that you really aren't changing anyone's opinion, right?"" Repairing relationships . It started out as friendly barbs on Facebook, childhood friends sparring over differences in the presidential election. Sarah Mirocha supported Obama; her friend supported Romney. But by the time the conversation was over, the two were no longer friends -- on social media or otherwise. ""One less hateful troll = more peace on my page,"" Mirocha, 43, wrote in a Facebook post. The Iowa-based writer made no apologies: ""It's my page, isn't it?"" Yes and no, says etiquette blogger Thomas P. Farley of What Manners Most. ""The beauty of social media is that it does allow us to be commentators on the news. But you have to be aware of your audience,"" Farley said. ""You know these people would never say anything to your face. But it is sort of an unfortunate consequence of anonymity online."" For many people, the hardest part of the 2012 political debate may be restoring friendships that have been damaged. ""I think that for friends, real friends, it will get better,"" said Stevens, who after the election plans to restore a number of Twitter voices he has muted. ""I think for people that are partisan acquaintances, it will probably calm down a little."" But Farley believes repairing friendships damaged by political differences will probably take a little work. ""If it's somebody you see regularly,"" he said, ""I would have the conversation in person.""","A survey finds 18% of social network users have blocked or defriended over political posts .

"(CNN) -- Film director Sidney Lumet, who made the American classics ""12 Angry Men,"" ""Network,"" ""Serpico,"" ""Dog Day Afternoon"" and ""The Verdict,"" died Saturday morning in his New York City home. He was 86. His daughter, Jenny Lumet, told CNN he died of complications from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma at 3:40 a.m. ET. He was surrounded by family at the time of his death, she said. Lumet's films often dealt with deep moral and ethical issues, starting with his film, ""12 Angry Men"" in 1957, which featured Henry Fonda playing the sole holdout juror who convinces the others that a man on trial is, in fact, innocent. Lumet also tapped into the national consciousness with ""Network,"" the 1976 satirical film about a TV anchor whose signature rant became a household phrase for every American frustrated with the system and hypocrisies: ""I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore!"" Nominated for 10 Academy Awards, including best director, ""Network"" won four Oscars: best actor for Peter Finch, best actress for Faye Dunaway, best original screenplay for Paddy Chayefsky and best supporting actress for Beatrice Straight. Lumet's iconic films starred some of Hollywood's most accomplished actors. With Al Pacino as the lead actor, Lumet's ""Serpico"" delved into one cop's struggle against the seemingly insurmountable corruption in the New York City police department. The film was based on a book by Peter Maas about the struggles of two actual New York City cops, Frank Serpico and David Durk. Pacino secured an Oscar nomination for his performance. Pacino starred again in ""Dog Day Afternoon"" in 1975, which also featured a memorable chant -- ""Attica! Attica!"" -- that tapped into an American outrage about a deadly prison riot. The film dealt with protagonist Sonny's plan to rob a bank for his boyfriend's sex change operation, though Sonny is a married man. His gang's bank robbery, a tale also inspired by actual events, is foiled. In 1982, Lumet directed another courtroom drama, ""The Verdict,"" whose screenplay was written by David Mamet, and whose cast was led by Paul Newman. Lumet and Newman both received Oscar nominations. Despite his filmmaking accomplishments, Lumet never won an Oscar for any particular film. However, in 2005, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences gave him an honorary Academy Award. In a statement, Grammy Award-winning producer and composer Quincy Jones said Lumet gave him his start in film composing in 1963 with ""The Pawnbroker."" ""I was privileged to work with him on four additional films including 'The Wiz.' Sidney was a visionary filmmaker whose movies made an indelible mark on our popular culture with their stirring commentary on our society,"" Jones said in a statement. ""Future generations of filmmakers will look to Sidney's work for guidance and inspiration, but there will never be another who comes close to him."" New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg described Lumet as ""one of the great chroniclers"" of New York City because his films often used the city as both settting and a figurative character. ""Sidney Lumet will be remembered for his ability to draw great performances out of his actors, his technical talents as a filmmaker and his zeal for the arts,"" Bloomberg said in a statement. ""I was lucky enough to know Sidney -- we spoke just last week. I let him know that we intend to honor him this June with the 'Made in NY' Lifetime Achievement Award. Sidney will now receive the award posthumously and I will ask his daughter Jenny, also in the movie business, to accept it on his behalf."" Lumet was born on June 25, 1924, in Philadelphia. His father, Baruch, was a Polish-born actor who moved the family to New York when Sidney was a baby. The family joined the Yiddish Art Theater, and Sidney Lumet began acting at age 4 with his father. Later, Lumet acted on Broadway and went into directing after serving in World War II. Lumet married four times, to actress Rita Gam, Gloria Vanderbilt and Gail Jones, the daughter of Lena Horne. He married Mary Gimbel in 1980: she survives him, along with another daughter by Jones, Amy Lumet; stepdaughter Leslie Gimbel; stepson Bailey Gimbel; nine grandchildren, and a great-grandson.

"New Delhi (CNN) -- The lawyer for one of the men accused in the gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old woman wants the trial moved out of New Delhi, where emotions have run high over the case. The defense lawyer will argue before the Indian Supreme Court on Wednesday that transferring legal proceedings outside the Indian capital would ensure a free and fair hearing. His appearance, which was originally scheduled for Tuesday, was pushed back a day. Meanwhile, a panel appointed by India's home affairs minister after the incident delivered a 600-page report Wednesday criticizing authorities and even everyday Indians for their apathy and ""low and skewed priority of dealing with complaints of sexual assault."" The group said social failings, not adequate criminal laws, are to blame for the lackadaisical treatment of sexual assault in India. ""Failure of good governance is the obvious root cause for the current unsafe environment eroding the rule of law, and not the want of needed legislation,"" the panel said in its report. However, the group did make several policy recommendations, including creating a new offense of gang rape punishable by at least 20 years in prison, making it a crime for police to fail to investigate sexual assault complaints and making it illegal to consider character or previous sexual experience of the victim at a criminal trial. Kirti Singh of the National Commission for Women called the report a ""landmark document."" The case that sparked the panel's review -- the December 16 gang rape of a woman in New Delhi -- has gripped India, prompting protests in the capital and other cites over the treatment of women and criticism of the way sexual assault cases are dealt with. Opinion: India's rape problem needs a rewiring of society's attitude . The consequences of the case are still unfolding in the Indian news media, with calls for tougher punishment of people convicted of rape. The five adult suspects in the December 16 incident appeared at a closed-door hearing at a fast-track court in New Delhi on Monday. Details about what was said in court cannot be reported under a judge's ruling imposing restrictions on coverage of the case. Police say the suspects attacked the woman and her male companion on a bus, robbed them and dumped them by the side of the road. The woman, badly injured in the attack, died two weeks later, despite being flown to Singapore for treatment. Her companion survived. The five men are charged with murder, rape and kidnapping and could face the death penalty if convicted. A sixth suspect, who is believed to be too young to be tried as an adult, is facing proceedings in a juvenile court. Indian rape debate: Why death penalty is no solution . The case is being heard in a ""fast-track"" court, which India introduced to try to expedite cases in a justice system bogged down by red tape. It means that sessions of the trial, once it begins, should take place nearly every working day until a verdict is reached. The hearing Monday was a procedural step at which the charge sheet detailing prosecutors' accusations against the suspects was submitted. The trial will begin once the prosecution's arguments are made in court. Rape case 'an awakening' for India, victim's father says . The next hearing is scheduled for Thursday, according to defense lawyers. The magistrates' court that initially heard the case imposed restrictions on what the news media can report about events in court. That practice is common in rape cases in India to protect the victim's identity, and the magistrate said it was also necessary out of concern for the suspects' safety amid intense media coverage and widespread anger. India rape victim's family wants hospital in her village . Authorities have not released the name of the dead woman, but Indian protesters have been calling her Damini, which means ""lightning"" in Hindi. ""Damini"" is also a 1993 Bollywood film whose lead female character fights for a housemaid, a victim of sexual assault. Companion of India rape victim: I begged attackers to stop . The events have also focused the attention of the Indian news media on attacks against women around the huge country. Newspapers and television stations have been reporting other shocking rape allegations on an almost daily basis. In one of the most recent examples, police in the eastern state of Odisha arrested six men after they were accused of gang-raping a 25-year-old woman Sunday as she was on her way home from visiting her brother at a hospital. The six men, including two who worked as custodians at the hospital, are alleged to have taken the woman to an isolated area by a river and sexually assaulted her, said B.K. Aich, a police superintendent in the district of Mayurbhanj. Police are waiting for medical reports on the suspects to determine whether to take the case to court, Aich said. The number of reported rapes in India -- a country where a cultural stigma keeps many victims from reporting the crime -- has increased from 2,487 in 1971 to 24,206 in 2011, according to official figures. Most women in India have stories of sexual harassment and abuse on public transportation or on the streets, the Indian Council on Global Relations says.

The center, known as Ceclimar, said in a release this week that it reached the conclusion after analyzing the conditions in which the animals were found. Most of the birds were young, according to biologist Mauricio Tavares. The lean birds showed no signs of external injury or oil in their plumes. ""Birds in the first year of life are inexperienced,"" he said, adding that the pattern of dead birds is common for this time of year and that the deaths are a result of ""the process of natural selection."" In 2010, more than 550 penguins washed up on Sao Paulo state's Atlantic coast. In that case, necropsies showed that the penguins died of starvation. The Peruvian government launched an official inquiry this year when close to 3,000 dolphins and more than 500 pelicans washed up along that country's northern Pacific coast. This case is the first in which Ceclimar is conducting a more intensive monitoring of deaths. According to Tavares, July is historically the month when more birds arrive at the center for rehabilitation after washing up on the beaches weakened, injured or covered in oil. ""The animals usually migrate from Argentina around this time of year in search of food and warmer weather, and each year, some do wash up,"" he said. ""But over 500 is a very, very high number."" Ceclimar set up weekly monitoring along the Rio Grande do Sul coast to study the dynamics of the Magellan penguins. The biologists working at the center also collected 30 birds for a more detailed analysis; that report should be completed within a month. The release says the physical state of the birds is such that researchers could designate the deaths natural. Tavares said earlier that ""the animals were a lot smaller in terms of size and weight than normal penguins, so we think it will be natural causes, but it is certainly very strange."" Penguins have also shown up along the famous beaches of Rio de Janeiro. CNN affiliate TV Record reports that since the end of June, almost 40 penguins have been rescued along the beaches. In those cases, the birds are being cared for by SOS Aves and the Chico Mendes Institute for Conservation of Biodiversity.

"(CNN) -- Jennifer Tyrrell and her family went to the headquarters of the Boy Scouts of America in Irving, Texas, to deliver a petition of 300,000 signatures asking the organization to end its ban on gay Scouts and gay Scout leaders. The BSA's policy of ""not granting membership to open or avowed homosexuals"" is a travesty. It led to the dismissal of Jennifer, who was the den leader of her own 7-year-old son's troop in Bridgeport, Ohio. By reaffirming its anti-gay policy, the BSA is telling the entire nation that maintaining its legacy of discrimination is more important to them than strengthening the bond between a mother and her son. The BSA clearly has its priorities backwards. In spite of calls for change from its own board members, from high-profile Eagle Scouts and from Americans of all stripes, it refuses to budge. Other organizations, such as the Girl Scouts, 4-H clubs, the Boys & Girls Clubs of America and even the U.S. Armed Forces, have put an end to such discrimination. It might not be easy for an organization to admit it is wrong. Especially since the BSA has had this policy for decades; it has even gone all the way to the Supreme Court to try to preserve it. But just because you have a right to discriminate doesn't mean it is right to discriminate. No matter how much the organization digs in its heels, it has to acknowledge that Tyrell's story is widely accessible to the American people. And it isn't only Jennifer and her son who are affected by the policy. Parents in Bridgeport are angry that the BSA has put them in the position where they had to explain to their children why their favorite den leader would not be allowed back. Parents should not have to explain to their children why their favorite after-school activity discriminates against their friends and their friends' families. Over the past few months, I've gotten to know Jennifer very well. Her eyes light up when she speaks about her time with her son's troop. I've seen those same eyes well with tears when she recounts what the BSA did to her, simply because she is who she is. Her son, Cruz, is going to grow into a remarkable young man. But right now, he's a young boy who had been told for the first time, by an organization he wanted desperately to join, that his family isn't good enough. Jennifer and Cruz aren't alone in being tremendously hurt by the BSA. There are countless Scouts and Scout leaders living under the fear that they could be kicked out at any moment, simply for being gay or lesbian. Someday, this won't be the case. It is inevitable that the BSA will need to change its policy of intolerance. I believe the change will come soon. And the more we continue to speak out, the more we stand beside moms such as Jennifer, the more we demand that discrimination end, the sooner that ""someday"" will arrive. If the Boy Scouts of America's aim is to teach children about leadership qualities and moral values, it needs to start by treating the members of its community with fairness and decency. For more than 100 years, the BSA has prided itself on building tomorrow's leaders. But it cannot continue to do so by clinging to yesterday's antiquated and hateful biases. The time to change is now. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Herndon Graddick.","The Boy Scouts of America is not granting membership to gays and lesbians .

"(CNN) -- Ten-man Burkina Faso boosted their chances of reaching the quarterfinals of the Africa Cup of Nations Friday with a 4-0 trouncing of Ethiopia in Mbombela. The superb victory, owing much to two-goal Alain Traore, left them in pole position in Group C after holders Zambia and Nigeria drew 1-1 in the early kick off in Rustenburg. Burkina Faso were leading 1-0 through a first half Traore strike when they had goalkeeper Abdoulaye Soulama sent off in the second half for handling the ball outside his area. But Traore, who plays for Lorient in the French League, struck minutes later with a blistering shot from just outside the area to all but sink Ethiopia's chances of getting back into the match with a man advantage. He had also scored Burkina Faso's last-gasp equalizer against Nigeria in the opening match of the tournament in South Africa. Traore then set up Djakaridja Kone for the third as the Ethiopia defense opened up again. Jonathan Pitroipa rounded off the win with the fourth in stoppage time to make it a miserable evening for the Ethiopian fans who had made up the majority of a sizable crowd in the stadium. It left Burkina Faso with four points from two games, with Zambia and Nigeria on two apiece. Ethiopia have just one point. Zambia, who won last year's championship, looked headed for the exit door when they trailed Nigeria late into their game. But they were awarded a controversial penalty, which was converted with considerable aplomb by Zambia goalkeeper Kennedy Mweene, lofting his effort into the roof of the net. Mweene had been at the receiving end of a first half spot kick awarded to Nigeria, but watched on as Chelsea's Jon-Obi Mikel scuffed a feeble effort wide of the post. Henri Richard's Zambia were encouraged by the miss, but it was Nigeria who struck first through Emmanuel Emenike in the 57th minute. It looked enough to seal through crucial points until Davies Nkausu tangled with Ahmed Musa in the penalty area and the referee pointed to the spot. Nigeria goalkeeper and captain Victor Enyeama was disgusted by the award and was well beaten by his counterpart, who regularly takes penalties South Africa Premier League club Free State Stars. ""That was one of the worst calls I've seen in the history of football,"" he told AFP. The group will be decided next Tuesday with Burkina Faso taking on Zambia in Mbombela, while Ethiopia face Nigeria in Rustenburg.","Burkina Faso beat Ethiopia 4-0 in Group C match at Africa Cup of Nations .

"(CNN) -- You might associate music festivals with muddy fields and heaving crowds, but Mali's ""Festival au Desert"" is a world away from all that. Based a few kilometers outside the historic town of Timbuktu, on the fringes of the Sahara Desert, the festival is inspired by the traditional gatherings of the region's Tuareg nomads. It's been running since 2001, bringing together musicians from the region, and beyond. It's perhaps the only festival in the world where you can watch camel racing while listening to amped-up desert blues, where hawkers sell headscarves rather than burgers and where you can camp in a Tuareg tent among miles of empty sand dunes. See also: Asa, African pop legend in the making . This year's festival, held in January, was in doubt after the kidnap of three tourists and the killing of another in Timbuktu, in November last year. The festival did go ahead, with an increased security presence, but security fears and travel warnings reportedly kept many tourists away. Those who did make it to the three-day event saw performers including soulful Sudanese singer Amira Kheir, Nigerien group Koudede, and an all-star tribute to the music of legendary Malian guitarist Ali Farka Toure. In the past, European acts including Robert Plant, Manu Chao and Damon Albarn have performed at the festival. This year, U2 singer Bono made a cameo appearance, singing onstage with local favorites -- and now international stars -- Tinariwen. Watch video: Mali's nomadic musicians . It's the authentic homegrown stars that really represent the festival. Among them is local Tuareg group Tartit, which was formed in 1995 by a group of women who met in a refugee camp.

"(CNN) -- The tears of joy from a year ago turned to tears of sorrow as Zambia became the first defending champion to be knocked out in the first round of the Africa Cup of Nations in 21 years. Herve Renard's side was held to a goalless draw by group winners Burkina Faso in Nelspruit, South Africa Tuesday. That result, combined with Nigeria's 2-0 win over Ethiopia, sent the Super Eagles through and left Zambia inconsolable. Zambia coach Renard told reporters: ""It's better to have won something in your life than always qualify for the quarterfinals, but never win anything. ""Everybody is sad but my players did their maximum, and I'm very proud of them. It's not the end of the world. ""I loved my team tonight, I can't play with eight defenders. If there is someone who is responsible (for our elimination) then it's me, not my players."" Burkina Faso take giant stride towards knockout stage . Two penalties from Chelsea's Victor Moses set up an intriguing looking quarterfinal between Nigeria and tournament favorite Ivory Coast. Burkina Faso, which until this year had never won a game in the competition away from home, will find out Wednesday whether it will face Togo or Tunisia. ""We believed we could go further in this. It's a night of history for Burkina Faso,"" coach Paul Putt told reporters. ""We had double motivation being close to qualification and playing against the champions. I told the players this chance might never come again."" Mali bring cheer . Just 12 months ago in Gabon, the Chipolopolo celebrated its shock win where they were inspired by the loss of the 1993 Zambian team, which perished in a plane crash close to the venue of the final in Libreville. But it was unable to pull off a repeat this time around, managing three draws in its three group games. Instead, it was Nigeria which took second place behind Burkina Faso following a hard-fought win over Ethiopia in Rustenburg. Fuad Ibrahim eyes Ethiopia chance . Ethiopia, which returned to the tournament for the first time in 31 years, fell behind on 79 minutes when Moses fired home from the penalty spot. It got worse for Ethiopia 11 minutes later when goalkeeper Sasay Bancha was sent off for bringing down Moses inside the penalty area. Moses added a second from 12-yards to spark wild celebrations and seal Nigeria's place in the last eight. ""This is a victory for Nigerians where ever they are in the world,"" Nigeria coach Stephen Keshi told reporters. ""This is a time for celebration.I thought Sunday Mba was outstanding in midfield and his introduction is part of my plan to build a team around young players, and senior players like captain Joseph Yobo, vice-captain Victor Enyeama and John Obi Mikel.

"(CNN) -- A Texas mother of five is expected to be sentenced Tuesday after admitting to gluing her 2-year-old daughter to a wall and beating her over potty training. Elizabeth Escalona, 23, was in a Dallas County, Texas, court Monday as witnesses -- including her mother and the pediatrician who cared for the toddler -- testified in the first day of her sentencing hearing, while prosecutors showed pictures of the little girl's hands and bruised body and forehead. ""The entire picture was very shocking,"" said Dr. Amy Barton, then a child abuse pediatrician at Children's Medical Center of Dallas, choking back tears on the stand. ""I see a lot of children, and this was one of the most shocking cases that I have seen."" Jocelyn Cedillo was less than two months shy of her third birthday in September 2011 when Escalona, her mother, used a powerful adhesive to glue her hands to a wall and beat her. Three other children of Escalona, who was pregnant at the time, witnessed the abuse, according to Dallas County district attorney's office spokeswoman Debbie Denmon. The child urinated on herself during the ordeal, during which she was hit in head and kicked in the groin, among other forms of abuse, said Denmon. Oefelia Escalona, the defendant's mother, testified Monday that she found the girl and took her to the hospital. ""I saw Jocelyn laying in the bed. She was facing the wall and ...,"" the 42-year-old woman said, before she started crying and turned away. It wasn't clear exactly how long young Jocelyn was glued to the wall before she was brought to the Dallas hospital. Once there, medical authorities noticed severe bruises to her face and head, as well as a severe brain injury that led to her temporarily being in a coma. Escalona pleaded guilty on July 12 to a charge of first-degree injury to a child, a crime punishable by anywhere between five years and life in prison. Prosecutors are asking Escalona be incarcerated for 45 years, so she will not cause any more harm to her children, Denmon said. ""When these types of crimes occur we have to send a message, not only to the perpetrator, but to the citizens of Dallas County as a whole,"" District Attorney Craig Watkins told CNN. ""If you choose to commit these types of crimes, we will ensure that you receive an adequate punishment."" Prior to this incident, Escalona had been investigated by Texas Child Protective Services but never arrested or charged, said Denmon. The child welfare agency put all of her children in foster care after her toddler daughter was taken to the hospital. All five of them, including Jocelyn, are now in the custody of their grandmother, Oefelia Escalona.","A mother beat her 2-year-old daughter and glued her to the wall over potty training .

"(CNN) -- As the new Japanese government of Shinzo Abe unleashes a new round of stimulus for the ailing economy, a Tokyo restaurateur has thrown his support behind the new government -- but it comes with a resigned sigh that seems to mark most leadership changes in the world's third largest economy. ""I voted for Abe and the Liberal Democratic Party,"" says Shigeki Koshiba, chef and owner of Hainan Jeefan Shokudo, a restaurant that specializes in Singaporean food. ""I decided to give them another chance. I give these guys a last chance."" Japan starts the new year under its seventh prime minister in seven years and a return to power for Abe's Liberal Democratic Party. The list of challenges for Abe -- who was previously prime minister in 2006-2007 -- is long and familiar: Deflation, the strong yen, an aging population and an expensive country in which to live. All of this existed well before the damage from the tsunami, earthquake and nuclear disaster in March 2011. CNNMoney: Japan unveils $117 billion stimulus package . During the recent campaign, Abe promised more stimulus spending even though Japan's debt to GDP ratio is estimated at 236%, according to recent International Monetary Fund projections. That's the highest debt level in the developed world. On Friday, he made good on that promise as the government unveiled a $117 billion fiscal stimulus package in a bid to boost growth. ""Abenomics"" is the nickname given to the prime minister's push for more quantitative easing from the Bank of Japan and a doubling of the inflation rate to 2%. ""Abenomics is not just about the central bank. It is about coordinating policy which is something here in Japan we have not had in basically five or six years,"" Jesper Koll, head of Japan Equities at JP Morgan, tells CNN. Koll says the acceleration of both fiscal and monetary policy is key. ""That's where the good news is going to be coming from in Japan the next six to nine months."" Read more: Waiting for Japan's election: Could the 'Abe trade' be justified? But Yonghao Pu, UBS Chief Investment Strategist for Asia-Pacific, says more stimulus is not as simple as it sounds. ""That's the trick question. If you print a lot more money, you're more likely to have inflation than deflation. On the positive side, quantitative easing can reduce deflation,"" he said. ""But if you have inflation come back, the investors (in Japanese government bonds) are not going to be happy with 2% inflation because the net return will be negative 1%. So they (Abe) cannot overdo it."" Restaurant owner Koshiba and his brother-in-law -- Paul Yang, the CEO of Delta Capital, a real estate development company -- will watch the political leadership with a wary eye. Read more: Shinzo Abe: The answer to ailing Japan's problems? Yang says the biggest problem in Japan is the lack of innovation in big business. Corporate tax is 40% which drives many foreign businesses out. He says the government needs to offer more incentives for companies to stay in Japan. His own development company is getting creative by moving away from traditional business models. Delta Capital is talking to Japanese universities about leasing their land, building dormitories and managing them. ""We're trying to stay away from buying land and we're borrowing land instead,"" Yang says. He believes Japan's complex rules make leasing a better option. ""It's economically more viable because yields and returns are so much better if you don't have to buy the land. We're trying to create a new real estate asset class."" Koshiba's restaurant is casual and the average lunch costs $10. ""We don't feel the economy slowing down because business is constant. For me and a lot of my restaurant friends, turnover is not bad."" But he keeps his eye on the cost of electricity. Since the nuclear crisis at Fukushima, the cost of power has increased. Koshiba now has to pay $600 more per month at his two restaurant locations. He's also watching the yen which has weakened significantly since Abe called for more stimulus in November. While a weaker yen helps exporters by making their products cheaper overseas, it can have an adverse affect on businesses like restaurants and supermarkets that need to buy imports. ""It depends how long the yen weakening lasts. A lot of food stuff is imported from outside,"" says Koshiba. ""There's always a time lag. If this (weakening yen) continues, it'll affect a lot of people.""","Japan unveiled a $117 billion fiscal stimulus package Friday in bid to boost growth .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- About a year ago, a former quarterback with the San Diego Chargers and a retired linebacker with the Minnesota Vikings lifted their once-sturdy frames onto a cold examination table. Meanwhile, a radioactive chemical was coursing through their bodies on its way to receptors in their brain tissue. A hum filled the room as each man slid toward a doughnut-shaped opening on a brain scanner. When their scans were later analyzed, crimson and bright yellow bands appeared deep in their brains, indicating damage. The two former players, Wayne Clark and Fred McNeill, were participants in a pilot study at UCLA that may have found a destructive protein called tau in the brains of five living retired National Football League players. Tau is significant because it has been found -- posthumously -- in the brains of dozens of former NFL players, including Junior Seau, Dave Duerson, Terry Long, Shane Dronett and Mike Webster. All committed suicide and were later diagnosed with a disease called chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Some scientists call finding the disease in the brains of living players the ""holy grail"" of CTE research, a way to diagnose and treat it. The UCLA study may turn out to be an important first step in that effort. But at this early juncture, the small study poses more questions than answers. Consider McNeill and Clark. Study authors say both had tau in their brain tissue, yet they are on opposite ends of the cognitive spectrum. McNeill, 60, has been diagnosed with early stage dementia, while Clark, 65, is cognitively normal. Lamar Campbell: Why I'm donating my brain . ""The sample is too small, and we don't know enough to make much sense about this,"" said Dr. Gary Small, lead author of the study, which appeared last week in the American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry. Clark's brain scan -- as crude a picture as it provides of his brain function -- showed bright patches of red and yellow in key areas of the brain associated with rage, depression and memory problems. The hypothesis of the study is that the more concentrated the tau protein, the more red and yellow appears on the scan. Yet Clark says the worst thing that happens to him daily is occasionally forgetting the name of someone he just met. ""He's in his mid-60s and just has normal aging, has mild memory complaints typical for somebody that age,"" said Small, professor of psychiatry at the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior at UCLA. ""So we need to do more studies of players with symptoms, more studies of players without symptoms, and see what the correlations are."" In contrast to Clark's scans, McNeill's were flecked with red here and there, but most of his scan was greenish in hue, suggesting less tau. When his wife got the news that researchers may have found tau in McNeill's brain, she was anything but surprised. His cognitive decline has been slow and, at times, painful. But when Tia McNeill, who is separated from her husband, considered the possibility that another player has tau but no cognitive problems, she remained unfazed. ""I think that as with anything, our bodies are all different,"" she said. ""There are some players that are deeply affected and other that aren't."" Scan may detect signs of NFL players' brain disease . She knows that story well, recalling McNeill's roommate when he played for the Vikings. ""They entered the league the same year, played the same position, used the same equipment, had the same coaches,"" but today the former roommate is cognitively normal. Clark and McNeill are around the same age, but that's where their similarities end. Clark started playing football in high school and was not a sought-after college recruit. He made it to the NFL and mostly lingered on the sideline as a backup quarterback. ""I didn't personally feel at risk at all because I didn't take the steady contacts that other players did,"" Clark said. McNeill, on the other hand, began playing at a younger age, was a first-round draft pick when he entered the NFL, and by the time his career ended in 1985, he had played football for more than 20 years. Quarterbacks like Clark -- especially backups -- get nowhere near the number of hits linebackers like McNeill suffer. In fact, the highest-profile cases of CTE thus far have primarily been diagnosed among linemen and linebackers, positions where hits to the head occur on virtually every play. ""One of the arguments is that it may have less to do with the number of concussions but more the number of sub-concussive impacts over the course of a player's career,"" said Kevin Guskiewicz, director of the Center for the Study of Retired Athletes at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. That might explain Clark's lack of symptoms. NFL Players Association, Harvard planning $100 million player study . Another popular theory among researchers is that the stark cognitive difference between players like Clark and McNeill could boil down to genetics. Small points out that when it comes to Alzheimer's disease, which shares some symptoms with CTE, there are certain genes, like ApoE4, that predispose people to worse cognition. So could McNeill be genetically more vulnerable to cognitive problems? Or was it the sheer number of hits he took to the head compared with Clark? ""Everything needs to be put on the table,"" said Guskiewicz, a concussion expert. ""It may be something environmental, it may be genetic. What we need to focus on is what creates this perfect storm."" Small is realistic about the study -- despite his confidence in the early findings -- and the need for much more data to explain what that perfect storm looks like. ""I would say to (Clark), 'Yes, I know that you have a scan that looks different,' but we don't know what that means yet,"" Small said. ""What I suspect is that it's not just the scan. There may be a lot of other variables that come into play that determine whether there's a close correlation between the tau deposits in the brain and any clinical symptoms.""

"(CNN) -- ""Battlestar Galactica,"" Syfy's reimagining of the 1978 TV series, stands as one of the most successful sci-fi franchises of the past decade. Once the critically acclaimed show ended its run in 2009, fan interest in more adventures didn't waver. Unfortunately, the first spinoff, ""Caprica,"" only lasted one season, but another potential series, ""Battlestar Galactica: Blood and Chrome,"" showed promise. Now, more than two years since ""Caprica"" ended, fans are finally able to see the pilot for ""Blood and Chrome"" on YouTube's Machinima Network (eight parts have been posted). CNN spoke to executive producer David Eick and actor Luke Pasqualino (who stars as a younger version of Edward James Olmos' character, Cmdr. William Adama) about the new series. CNN: Why Adama? David Eick: When posed with the opportunity of creating new stories in the ""Battlestar Galactica"" universe, I chose Adama because he remained the most mystifying character. There was his relentless hatred of the Cylons, his equally unwavering commitment and loyalty to friendships -- even at the point of being at the expense of blood relations. There's things about Adama that you got hints of in ""Battlestar,"" but there were a lot of questions that remained unanswered. CNN: Do you see this as a show that is mostly for ""BSG"" fans or an entry point for new viewers? Eick: Once you call it ""Battlestar Galactica"" in any way, shape or form, you're quite deliberately attempting to attract fans of the show. One of the regrets that we had about ""Caprica"" is that we were so intent on carving it out for a new audience that in the marketing of it, we strayed too far away from its lineage. Had we done it over again, I would call it ""Battlestar Galactica: Caprica."" At the same time, I firmly believe that if you never saw an episode of ""Battlestar,"" you could plop right into this thing and completely get it and enjoy it. CNN: Was this ever seen as a ""backdoor pilot,"" where it might conceivably end up on TV? Eick: It always originated as an online series. There was some confusion in the press when Syfy was toying for a period of time, with possibly launching it on-air first. When they went back to the plan of launching it online, there was a backlash, like ""Ooh, Syfy doesn't pick up pilot."" That was ridiculous, as it was never intended to be that. The deeper answer is that anyone who's worked with Syfy knows, there's no such thing as a finite, hardcore game plan when it comes to this stuff. ""Caprica"" premiered on Blu-Ray, then went on air. The conversation is ongoing, and at a certain point, as a creator you have to step out of it. I don't think it's specific to Syfy. It's the nature of genre storytelling when you have a variety of options to distribute it. At a certain point, as a creator, you'll go crazy if you worry too much about it. CNN: Is there a possibility for a season two? Eick: Like any premiere, we're waiting for feedback. The context of success and failure is completely alien to me. I don't know what constitutes a hit. If I had a show on television, I wouldn't know what constitutes a hit anymore. It keeps changing. I don't know what the criterion is for success. If it's met, I suspect we'll get into a conversation about more of them. If it's not met, I'm sure this will make a lovely DVD keepsake for someone. I am encouraged by the powers that be that they have very high expectations for this. The buzz about it is extremely strong and loud, and we would not be foolish to get our hopes up to anticipate future storytelling. CNN: Luke, what was it like stepping into a role created by someone like Edward James Olmos? Luke Pasqualino: In my eyes, Edward James Olmos set the precedent. He was a great commander as William Adama. He set the bar. As an artist, we're always looking to test ourselves in that respect. I was very delighted to have this opportunity. CNN: I heard you watched ""Caprica"" once you got the role. What else did you do in preparation? Pasqualino: One of the furthest things from my mind was watching anything Eddie had done as Adama. He's playing him at a much later stage, and you change so much in 20 years, I think you're a completely different person. He set the bar. I didn't want anything that Eddie did to sway my interpretation of the character. CNN: Were there any adjustments you had to make, knowing this was 100 minutes divided into 10 parts? Pasqualino: The biggest adjustment I had to make was this was my first test of my American accent, so I had to get that as close to believable as possible. I feel like I did a good job overcoming that one. It is very suspenseful, and you can get 10 or 12 minutes of wonder before watching the next one. CNN: Let's say this gets picked up and they decide to do multiple seasons of it. Is this the kind of role you see doing long-term? Pasqualino: 100 percent. I don't think there's one person who would like to see it get picked up any more than me. I fell in love with the project. I loved the style of work. It was my first leading American role. I had the most amazing time doing it. There is so much more that this young Adama can offer. This is the kind of age period where people start to find themselves. I think Adama needs to experience some highs and lows. I think we've only touched the surface of his journey.","""Battlestar Galactica: Blood and Chrome"" is second spinoff of Syfy series, now on YouTube .

"(CNN) -- A pair of robotic twins that have been diligently mapping the moon this year went out with a bang Monday. As scheduled, the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory probes Ebb and Flow crashed into a mountain on the moon, ending a fruitful mission to study the surface and composition of the celestial body. ""The two probes were sent purposely into the moon because they no longer had enough altitude or fuel to continue science operations,"" NASA said. The agency named the site where the spacecraft crashed for Sally Ride, the first American woman astronaut in space. She died in July. Ebb and Flow crashed on a mountain near the moon's north pole at 2:28 p.m. PT and 2:29 p.m. PT at a speed of 3,760 mph, NASA said. They were about the size of a washer and dyer. ""We will miss our lunar twins, but the scientists tell me it will take years to analyze all the great data they got, and that is why we came to the moon in the first place,"" said GRAIL project manager David Lehman of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ""So long, Ebb and Flow, and we thank you."" Thanks to GRAIL, scientists now have the highest-resolution gravity field map of any celestial body, NASA has said. That means the probes have been making a high-quality map of the gravitational field of the moon, giving scientists unprecedented insight into what's below the surface and how the moon may have formed. Results from this mission have delivered several other important findings, principal investigator Maria Zuber of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology told reporters last week. These include: . -- Evidence that the crust of the moon is much thinner than scientists believed. -- Some of the large impact basins dug into the moon's mantle, which is useful because scientists want to understand the moon's composition. It is believed that the composition of the Earth's mantle is similar to that of the moon. -- The moon's crust is much more fractured than scientists thought. -- It appears the crusts of planets, including Mars, have been bombarded in a similar way. If there was water on Mars, as scientists believe there may have once been, where would it have gone? GRAIL, looking at the moon, provides a clue: . ""These fractures provide a pathway deep inside the planet, and it's very easy to envision now how a possible ocean at the surface could have found its way deep into the crust of a planet,"" Zuber said. Another major finding: large, lava-filled cracks (dykes), which are hundreds of miles long and exist about 6 miles below the surface. There's no record of them at the surface of the moon. ""These dykes actually provide evidence for early expansion of the moon shortly after it formed,"" Zuber said. ""This had been predicted by models, but no evidence had been found."" CNN's Elizabeth Landau contributed to this report.","GRAIL probes Ebb and Flow crash into a mountain near the moon's north pole .

"(RollingStone.com) -- ""One of the things that made Walt and Skyler fall in love with each other was that he has a brilliant mind and so does she,"" says Anna Gunn of the character she plays on ""Breaking Bad"" -- leaving no doubt that she, for one, sees unlikely drug lord Walter White and his increasingly horrified wife Skyler as equals. It's not just talk: Gunn's the finest female foil for a male antihero on television right now, turning in a quietly crushing performance as an intelligent, independent woman slowly getting sucked into the gravitational maw of her husband's monstrousness. That conflict has led to her stunning breakdown on this week's episode -- and to Skyler joining the growing number of women characters on major TV dramas singled out by furious fans. Was Skyler's car-wash meltdown her crawlspace moment? Yeah, I think that's a pretty fair way to look at it. It's obviously the first time that anybody has seen her break like this. She just snapped. Walt's complete obliviousness to her emotional state in recent episodes had to have played a part in why she finally broke down. He used to be more attuned to her, if only to be a more effective liar, but now it's like he's on another planet and she's completely alone. She is. And she's more terrified than she's ever been in this whole thing, because she doesn't know what he's capable of. In playing these early episodes, whenever he comes into a room that I'm in, there was a feeling of me wanting to move as little as possible, wanting to breathe as little as possible, almost like you're prey and you know somebody's looking at you through the crosshairs. That was the feeling of it: ""Maybe if I don't make any sudden moves, maybe if I don't speak too loudly, he won't do anything."" Why do you think it was Marie who provoked her breakdown? I thought that was really clever. Despite the humorous side of their relationship -- well, humorous to the audience -- where Marie nitpicks and pokes at her sister all the time, I don't think Marie means to do that. They both really love each other. Betsy [Brandt] and Vince [Gilligan] and I have discussed this: ""Where's their family?"" You never hear about the rest of the family, the mom and dad, at all. We made the assumption that we did not have a particularly happy or easy childhood, and that led to the two of us sticking together, because they're very close. For actors, you've gotta sometimes fill in your backstory. At least that's what I did, very specifically -- that I needed Marie, and I love her, and I know she doesn't mean ill. But Skyler has not been able to let this stuff out to anyone -- only her divorce lawyer. It's been building up in her so much that at this point she's like a pot about to boil over. Marie just happened to push her buttons that day. And both because of the closeness of their relationship, and because of who Marie is and how she expresses herself by rattling on . . . on that particular day, there's not one more thing Skyler can handle, not one more thing she can take, so she just blows her top. By the end of the episode, I started wondering for the very first time if Skyler would resort to violence to escape her situation. What is her escape route at this point? This is what is stressing her right now. During the last couple of seasons it's like, ""Do I want to run away with the kids? Do I turn him into the police? What do I do?"" It's a constant wheel that turns in her head. When she realizes that he was responsible for Gus Fring's death, that's the bottom falling out of her life. When she walks out and she sees Junior watching Scarface and they're quoting the movie together, in light of everything else that's happened, it's so quietly horrifying to her that all she can do is turn around and walk back to her room. She knows that there's no saying, ""Walt, please don't do that."" They're past that. She's also in a state of depression at this point, a sinking-into-yourself where the feeling is, ""I don't really want to try. Why bother? Why bother doing anything?"" But, within that, there's still really desperate wheels turning. I don't think she cares about herself anymore -- she's just thinking, ""How can I keep my kids safe?"" She does not have the answer, but she's definitely looking for it. And you know what? She'd do anything to ensure that. She is desperate enough to do anything. There's been a backlash against Skyler, something she has in common with women characters on a variety of big dramas about men who tend behave much worse than they do. Do you have a sense of why this happens? Does it faze you at all? Some of it is still the double standard in our society -- that it's more acceptable for a man to be this antihero badass doing all these things that break the law or are really awful. People watching want to be Walt, or they identify with him. He doesn't have to answer to anybody. He does what he wants. There's a fantasy element to that, I think. I also think that in some ways, there's kind of a sexism to it, honestly. Sometimes . . . [pauses] I've been told particularly, how do you say . . . non-flattering or just really vicious -- you could use the word vitriolic -- angry stuff about Skyler, or about other female characters on other shows. The hatred and the vitriol and the venom and the nastiness and the attacks are so personal sometimes that it feels like, ""Oh gosh, OK, I get that you don't like Skyler, you like Walt, you're on his side, but it just feels different."" I don't feel like that stuff would be written about a male character. Honestly, Skyler is sometimes the biggest impediment to Walt doing whatever he wants. For the people who love Heisenberg, who love the badass Walt, when Skyler says, ""No, you shouldn't do that,"" they're like, ""What is her deal!? What's wrong with her?"" [Laughs] I can understand that. I can. But having looked at articles that cite other female characters being attacked like this, I find it disturbing just in terms of a cultural phenomenon. I'm not saying everyone who's into the show and has an opinion is like that, but I feel there's an element of that in there, and it's an interesting gender issue. I'm glad that people are talking about it. I caught up with ""Breaking Bad"" in a huge Netflix binge, and spending that much time in that world messed me up, emotionally. How do you feel at the end of shooting a season? Pretty much the same way. [Laughs] After we shoot certain scenes, I feel like I need to take a shower. A long, hot one. I've got about a thirty-minute ride home from the studio to where I live in Albuquerque, so that ride is important. Music is selected carefully to help me shed it. Sometimes in watching the episode, I will start to feel, in my body, the way I felt when I was filming the scene. Like at the end of Episode 2, where Walt climbs in the bed next to Skyler -- I felt this feeling of [makes gagging sound] in my body, the same feeling that was going on during the filming it. I can't watch it too close to bedtime. See full story at RollingStone.com.","Anna Gunn plays the wife of a drug lord on ""Breaking Bad .

"(CNN) -- Rescuers were scheduled to resume their search Friday morning for survivors of a ferry that sank off the Tanzanian island of Zanzibar, killing 60 people and leaving more than 80 people unaccounted for, the Red Cross said. As night fell Thursday, crews halted their search until the next morning, the Red Cross said. The vessel with about 290 people aboard -- including 31 children -- capsized near Zanzibar on Wednesday, according to a spokesman for the agency's office in Tanzania. About 145 people have been found alive, and rescue operations are ongoing, said Raymond Kanyambo, a spokesman for the agency. Rescuers search for bodies after Indian ferry disaster . Authorities intensified efforts Thursday by using army helicopters, government troops and boats. Strong winds and rough waves, which officials blame for the capsizing, complicated ongoing rescue efforts, he said. Ferries in the region often carry passengers not included in the manifest, making it hard to pinpoint the exact number of people aboard. The ferry was traveling between the Tanzanian commercial capital of Dar es Salaam and Zanzibar, the Indian Ocean archipelago popular with tourists for its pristine sandy beaches. Bangladesh ferry death toll rises to more than 100 . Zanzibar is a semi-autonomous part of Tanzania. The capsizing Wednesday is the latest such disaster in the popular tourist destination of Zanzibar in less than a year.

"(CNN) -- Lance Armstrong has been asked to return all prize money from his seven annulled Tour de France victories by the sport's governing body, who confirmed the history books will show no winner of the famous race between 1999-2005. The disgraced American operated ""the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen,"" according to the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA). At a meeting at their Swiss headquarters, the International Cycling Union (UCI) also announced an independent commission would examine its handling of the Armstrong case. The 41-year-old is still to comment on claims he consistently used performance enhancing drugs throughout his career, though he has decided not to contest the case. In a written response, Armstrong's office asserts that witness testimony to USADA is contradictory to prior testimony; that witnesses testified only after Armstrong decided not to contest the USADA proceeding; and that USADA offered sweetheart deals to active riders in exchange for their testimony. But the UCI is determined to pursue him for the riches he received as a result of his seven straight victories in cycling's most prestigious race, while confirming the record books will be left blank. A statement on the UCI's official website read: ""With respect to Lance Armstrong and the implications of the USADA sanctions which it endorsed on Monday 22 October, the Management Committee decided not to award victories to any other rider or upgrade other placings in any of the affected events. ""The committee decided to apply this ruling from now on to any competitive sporting results disqualified due to doping for the period from 1998 to 2005, without prejudice to the statute of limitation. ""The International Cycling Union (UCI) has asked Lance Armstrong to return all the prize money he won from his seven Tour de France victories, that have been struck off due to allegations of doping. ""The UCI Management Committee acknowledged that a cloud of suspicion would remain hanging over this dark period -- but that while this might appear harsh for those who rode clean, they would understand there was little honor to be gained in reallocating places."" The UCI and its president Pat McQuaid has come under fire for not picking up Armstrong's doping, despite testing him over 200 times. There are also question marks about a $100,000 donation from Armstrong to the UCI in 2002, revealed in USADA's report, but McQuaid insists there was no cover up in regard to Armstrong's activities. Former Tour de France winner Greg LeMond called on McQuaid and the UCI's honorary president Hein Verbruggen to resign over their handling of the case. He said the pair had abused their power and that cycling would not be able to move on unless they were to quit. The UCI declined to comment on the story when contacted by CNN. LeMond's views were echoed by Scott Mercier, a former cyclist with the U.S. Postal Service team before Armstrong joined them, who claims he quit the sport after being asked to use banned substances. He told CNN: ""The sport is going to have some tough times and I think there needs to be a leadership change for it to really be able to move forward. ""The leadership needs to be held accountable; if you look at the business world the CEO would either resign or be fired. The management committee did not do that. It is still the same guys who were there during this and I don't think it's nearly enough."" The UCI said it would soon appoint a fully independent external commission that would look into the role it played during the Armstrong affair and report no later than June next year. It has also decided to suspend legal action against former Sunday Times journalist Paul Kimmage who accused them, as well as Quaid and Verbruggen, of corruption, until after the commission reports. McQuaid said in the same UCI statement that it was ""determined to turn around this painful episode in the history of our sport."" ""We will take whatever actions are deemed necessary by the independent Commission and we will put cycling back on track,"" he added. ""Today, cycling is a completely different sport from what it was in the period 1998-2005. Riders are now subject to the most innovative and effective anti-doping procedures and regulations in sport. ""Nevertheless, we have listened to the world's reaction to the Lance Armstrong affair and have taken these additional decisive steps in response to the grave concerns raised.""","Cycling's governing body ask Lance Armstrong to return all his Tour de France prize money .

"Washington (CNN) -- The grounding of Boeing Dreamliners entered its second week with the company and investigators working non-stop in the United States and Japan to try to pinpoint fire risk in the 787 electrical system. U.S. aviation authorities are evaluating data but still do not have a handle yet on the cause of a battery fire on one Dreamliner and the reason behind a related incident on another plane that prompted regulators worldwide to idle the $200 million wide body until further notice. With battery and related components under microscopic examination and a new round of testing at manufacturing facilities underway this week, U.S. government officials at the center of the issue expressed eagerness to get to the bottom of the matter. But they also said it was crucial to let experts do a thorough job and the plane be re-certified as safe before lifting the order barring further flight. ""We don't know what is causing these incidents yet,"" Federal Aviation Administration chief Michael Huerta told reporters at an industry event in Washington on Wednesday. ""We need to let them finish their work,"" Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said at the same event. ""These are expert people. They'll get to the bottom of it and then we'll let all of you know what they find out,"" LaHood said. Experts: Quick fix for Dreamliner looks less likely . Boeing said in a statement that its technical experts are working ""around the clock"" and are focused on ""resolving the issue"" and returning the 787 to service. ""We are working this issue tirelessly in cooperation with our customers and the appropriate regulatory and investigative authorities. The company is eager to see both investigative groups continue their efforts and determine the cause of these events, and support their thorough resolution,"" said company spokesman Marc Birtel. A battery-related fire in the underbelly of an empty Japan Airlines 787 on the tarmac in Boston on January 7 triggered an FAA review of the aircraft. But regulators said the plane was still safe to fly. The FAA then grounded the fleet on January 16 after an emergency landing by an All Nippon Airways flight in Japan that was prompted by a battery alarm and a report of a burning smell. Analysis of a flight recorder from that plane showed that a lithium-ion battery experienced a sudden drop in voltage and was not overcharged, the Japan Transport Safety Board said Wednesday. Opinion: How Boeing can bounce back from Dreamliner problems . The agency is still investigating the cause of the battery's sharp fall in voltage, Norihito Goto, its chairman, said at a news conference. GS Yuasa, the battery's maker, is now disassembling the device to examine it in detail. The Japanese findings come after the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said over the weekend that the battery in the Boston fire had not been overcharged, eliminating a relatively simple potential cause but adding new complexity to the investigation. Additional details released by the safety board said all eight cells of the lithium-ion battery involved in the Boston 787 fire showed varying degrees of thermal damage. Investigators scanned and dismantled six of them to expose electrodes for microscopic examination. Those batteries are used to power electrical systems, especially when the plane's engines are idle. Dreamliner woes explained . The U.S. safety board also oversaw a series of new tests on battery systems and related components with manufacturers on Tuesday in Arizona. In Washington on Wednesday, U.S. officials were asked about the timing of the very unusual order to ground a fleet of planes. ""On the day we said the planes were safe, they were. On the day we announced that there was another incident and we were grounding the plane, we felt this was the time to ground the planes,"" LaHood said. Huerta explained that the second incident occurred during a flight. ""And that for us was an important consideration where we needed to identify what was causing these power- and battery-related incidents,"" he said. The FAA order applied directly to the six Dreamliners operated by United Airlines, the only ones flown by U.S. carriers. But its directive was picked up aviation authorities globally and requires that the planes be deemed safe before they fly again. Although there are only 50 wide body Dreamliners in service, there are several hundred on order. The world's largest aircraft manufacturer has made a big bet on the most technologically advanced airliner. The 787 is highly touted because of its mostly lightweight carbon fiber construction, which airlines expect will help them save billions in fuel costs on long-haul routes. Its cockpit design and cabin appointments are state of the art. The high level of attention and widespread concern about its problems and image now are partly due to the Dreamliner's difficult development.

"(CNN) -- The Islamist rebels fighting to overthrow Mali's government are ""determined, well-equipped and well-trained"" and still hold a key town in the central part of that African country, French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said Tuesday. French troops and warplanes joined the battle last week on the side of Malian government forces, and Le Drian said the intervention stopped the Islamists from overrunning Bamako, the capital. The Islamists, who have seized much of northern Mali, had hoped to deliver a ""definitive blow"" to the government by capturing the city of Mopti, he told reporters in Paris. ""We prevented it,"" he said. But the push has not yet driven them from the town of Konna, the scene of a fierce battle last week that weakened the Malian army, Le Drian said. ""We are facing a versatile adversary who is determined, well-equipped and well-trained,"" he said. France, the former colonial power in Mali, has committed about 1,700 troops and air crews to the fight, Le Drian said. The force includes about 800 troops on the ground in Mali, including an armor unit. The operation is hitting ""significant concentrations of fighters and vehicles"" in the north, behind the front lines, and bolstering government troops' defense of Bamako, he said. The campaign will continue ""as long as it is necessary"" to defend Mali's embattled government and allow the speedy deployment of an African-led peacekeeping mission and a European force that will train Malian troops, Le Drian said. And speaking on a visit to the United Arab Emirates, French President Francois Hollande said the number of French troops deployed would increase ""so that France can make way as quickly as possible"" for an African force. France has no intention of staying in Mali permanently but would do what was necessary until the African force was ready to take over, he said. Read more: What's behind the instability in Mali? Hollande said France had three aims: stopping the ""terrorist aggression"" from the north; securing Bamako and safeguarding French nationals there; and enabling Mali to recover its territorial integrity. And he stressed that France was in Mali at the request of its government, with the support of its neighbors and world powers, and within the framework of international law. ""If we had not taken up our responsibility and if on Friday morning we had not acted with this intervention, where would Mali be today?"" he asked. French defense minister: Islamist rebels gaining ground in Mali . Defense chiefs from the members of the West African regional bloc ECOWAS were meeting Tuesday in Bamako to discuss military options, said a spokesman for the bloc, Sunny Ugoh. Ministers will meet Friday to finalize plans that will then be presented to the heads of state Saturday in Ivory Coast, he said. Leaders from a number of countries, including NATO allies the United States and Canada, have said they'll send troops or provide logistical support for the fight against Islamist militants in the West African nation. Col. Mohammed Yerima, a spokesman for the Nigerian army, told CNN that 190 of its soldiers would arrive in Mali within 24 hours. In total, Nigeria will deploy 900 soldiers -- slightly more than a full battalion -- within the next 10 days, as part of a U.N.-mandated African force to fight the insurgents in Mali, he said. Read more: Is this al Qaeda's 'last chance' for a country? Niger, Burkina Faso, Togo, Senegal and Benin are also among the countries that have pledged to send troops, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius told reporters Monday. Hollande said he had spoken to the leaders of Mauritania and Algeria, both of which have agreed to close their borders with Mali to prevent fleeing militants from seeking refuge. Morocco has also authorized French planes to fly over its territory, he said. France also has wide support for its intervention within Europe, where countries including Britain, Denmark and Belgium have offered support, Hollande said. Two British military transport aircraft have been assigned to help with the French troop deployment, but no British forces will be in a combat role, the UK Foreign Office said. A spokesman for Germany's Foreign Ministry said the country's leaders were considering offering medical, logistical and humanitarian aid to Mali. The United Nations said preparations are under way for a U.N. multidisciplinary team to go to Bamako soon. Read more: France aims to 'eradicate' terrorism in Mali . The United States has shared intelligence from satellites and intercepted signals with the French, defense officials said Monday. In addition, the Pentagon is considering sending refueling tankers so that French jets can fly longer, more sustained combat missions, according to the officials. Drones ""are under consideration,"" the defense officials said, though the military's stash of unmanned aerial vehicles is in heavy demand. Both stressed that these would be surveillance drones and said there are no plans yet to deploy them. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland, meanwhile, said the United States is reviewing requests from the French, but no decisions have been made. The United States is ""not in the position to support the Malian military directly until we have democratic processes restored by way of an election in Mali,"" she said. The U.N. Security Council authorized a one-year military peacekeeping mission in the country in December. Members of ECOWAS, the Economic Community of West African States, pledged thousands of troops, and the Security Council has urged other nations to contribute forces as well. A French colony until 1960, Mali had military rulers for decades until its first democratic elections in 1992. It remained stable politically until March, when a group of soldiers toppled the government, saying it had not provided adequate support for them to fight ethnic Tuareg rebels in the country's largely desert north. Tuareg rebels, who'd sought independence for decades, took advantage of the power vacuum and seized swaths of land. A power struggle then erupted in the north between the Tuaregs and local al Qaeda-linked radicals, who wound up in control of a large area as the Tuaregs retreated. The United Nations says amputations, floggings and public executions -- like the July stoning of a couple who had reportedly had an affair -- have become common in areas controlled by radical Islamists. They applied a strict interpretation of Sharia law in banning music, smoking, drinking and watching sports on television, and damaged Timbuktu's historic tombs and shrines. CNN's Antonia Mortensen and Saskya Vandoorne contributed to this report.","French airstrikes hit behind Islamist rebel lines while troops bolster Bamako, minister says .

"(CNN) -- The last political drama of 2012 and the first one of 2013 suggest that if you love America, you might want to consider making your New Year's resolution quitting whatever political party you belong to. The ""fiscal cliff"" debate and the last-minute deal it produced have so far resolved nothing except to show that our system is profoundly broken and that radical changes are needed to fix it. While many in Washington are breathing a sigh of relief and some are trying to spin the outcome as a win for the president, those who characterize this bill as a genuine victory for anyone at all have clearly lost perspective. The deal brokered by Vice President Joe Biden and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell does make good on President Obama's promise to bring a little more equity to the tax code by raising rates on wealthier Americans, and it temporarily averts the most draconian ""sequestration"" cuts. But the list of what it does not do, and what it does wrong, is long. By midday Tuesday, the Congressional Budget Office had concluded that the Biden-McConnell package would add nearly $4 trillion to federal deficits over the next 10 years. This was largely because it actually extends and makes permanent more than 80% of the Bush tax cuts. So much for the idea that this whole struggle was supposed to help America get its financial house in order. Just as bad, or perhaps worse in terms of the day-to-day lives of average people, the bill only postpones the forced cuts of sequestration by two months, to precisely the moment the country will be engaged in another ruinous debate about lifting our national debt ceiling to ensure the country can pay its bills. It thus creates a new, even more dangerous fiscal cliff. Next time around, the markets will not be so blasÃ© about congressional brinkmanship if the national credit rating and the stability of a bedrock of the international financial system are at stake. It is an ominous sign for America that the only direction our top officials seem to be able to steer us is into yet another game of chicken. Opinion: Now look beyond the fiscal cliff . It is utter lunacy for the United States to face invented hazards that virtually no other major country does. We face plenty of profound challenges without having to invent new ones that only bring out the worst in our political gangs. I would use the term ""leaders"" as was common in the past, but precious few in this crowd actually deserve that label. The Senate package does not include any material spending cuts, infuriating those on the right. It angered many on the left because it worsened unionized government workers' job insecurity, is overly generous to the rich on inheritance taxes, and it doesn't protect entitlement programs. The head of the AFL-CIO, Richard Trumka, said the deal ""sets the stage for more hostage taking."" Further, the deal addresses only a tiny slice of the economic problems confronting America. Not only does it not address the $16 trillion national debt, it ignores the far bigger and more challenging deficit associated with looming retirement health care obligations. It also does not in any way address the still great need to help stimulate growth and create jobs in the U.S. economy. And it leaves in place most of the loopholes and provisions that allow America's richest to steadily accumulate more and more while inequality in this country gets worse and worse. So, this was both a manufactured crisis and an unnecessary distraction from bigger issues. The deal that was hastily cobbled together actually increases our deficit, and it creates an even bigger potential crisis just weeks from now. That said, other than its lack of vision, creativity, accountability, sense of responsibility, courage, basic math skills, wisdom or competence, this cliff deal is not bad. Zelizer: GOP faces choice: leadership or gridlock . Which raises two questions. One -- the one Washington will focus on -- is ""who is to blame?"" This question is based entirely on the illusion that there are two sides in our political battles. There are not, of course. All of us are in this together. One party speaks on behalf of one set of interests. The other party speaks on behalf of another. They dress it up in the language of principle and ideology, but at the end of the day, they act on behalf of the perceived economic interests of their bases -- not those who vote for them, but those who fund them. You may feel one party has done more than the other to cause this problem. That may be fair, but it is also a distraction from the bigger point. The only effective collaboration between both sides in this process has been inadvertent: A problem-creating partnership. In his late night remarks following the House passage of the bill, Obama lamented that this bill was not the ""grand bargain"" the country needed to meaningfully raise revenue, cut spending and focus sensibly on growth. He said there was not enough time for that. But of course, we knew this deadline was looming from the moment it was manufactured in our political sausage factory. Both sides decided not to address it during the political campaign. Oh, and then there is the additional reality that neither side even raised a grand bargain of the type proposed by the president's own Simpson-Bowles commission in a serious way. The fact that we even call the type of agreement that adequately starts to address our multiple needs a ""grand bargain"" as if it were some impossible dream reveals much about the current state of play in our nation's capital. Which brings us to the other question: How do we get out of this mess? The only solution is to recognize that everything in our system that institutionalizes and deepens our partisan divides and makes the compromises and collaboration that are the essence of democracy impossible must be seen as an obstacle to the greater good. It is time to realize that gerrymandering, campaign finance practices and the embrace of extra-constitutional traditions like filibuster rules deepen the divides that have made Washington dysfunctional. The two-party system is a boon for America when it is seen as providing a voice for two parts of a unified whole. But today's Washington is a zero-sum world of ideologues, men and women who have lost sight of who and what they are working for. It may be that only a real massive movement away from the existing parties and the corrupt system they have created can break the destructive cycle in which Washington -- and the American people -- are trapped. I've always felt such a move away from the current system was impossible, unrealistic. But then again, I never imagined a situation in Washington so dangerous to the well-being of so many Americans.

"(CNN) -- They were the strangest 34 minutes in Super Bowl history: The two teams were standing on the field. A hundred million people were watching at home. And the only thing that was happening was -- nothing. The power outage at the Superdome was not only one of the biggest story lines for Super Bowl XLVII. It sets the stage for the big game in one year at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Think about it: If a minor power outage can dominate talk around the biggest sporting event of the year, imagine the possible doomsday scenarios for the league's first cold-weather outdoor game. A winter storm could shut down the transportation hubs -- as a powerful nor'easter was expected to do through the Mid-Atlantic region starting Friday afternoon. Freezing rain could make the experience miserable for spectators. 5 Super Bowl moments to talk about Monday . Or the poor weather could keep the fans from arriving early in the week leading up to the game, which is when the host market reaps the biggest benefits from having the game. For these reasons and more, the New York/New Jersey Super Bowl -- just 359 days from now, for those fans already in serious football withdrawal -- could be the most important in NFL history. If the game is a success, it could not only open the door for New York/New Jersey to host future games -- and the CEO of its host committee said last week he wants that to become a reality -- but it also could lead to bids from other cold-weather markets such as Denver, New England and Washington. The funniest tweets of the #Blackout, er Super Bowl . If the game is a failure, it would not only reflect poorly on NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, who pushed for it, but it also would be the third black eye in four years for the marquee event on the NFL calendar. In 2011, the Super Bowl in Dallas was marred by controversy when temporary sections in Cowboy Stadium failed inspection, which meant 1,250 fans had expensive tickets for the game but no seats. This winter, the power failure may have helped the 49ers -- down 28-6 when the lights went out -- to regroup and nearly pull off the greatest comeback in the game's history. New York/New Jersey is on the clock. Can it exceed expectations? Al Kelly, the CEO of the host committee, not only thinks it will, but also believes hosting the game won't be a one-time thing. ""It's the biggest sporting event in North America,"" Kelly said. ""It's only right that it gets on the biggest stage in the world, and hopefully it makes sense that that should happen once a decade. Right? Jokesters, advertisers pounce on Super Bowl power outage . ""I don't have any vision that we're going to get three out of the next 12 Super Bowls or something. But maybe, because of all the other things you can do in the region, which is an endless list of options, we can have it again."" Kelly and his team spent last week in New Orleans attending events and meetings to gather as much information as possible from a city that has hosted 10 Super Bowls. They returned home to begin processing that information and continue their preparations for next winter. The priority: Finding more volunteers. Kelly said 12,000 already have signed up, but he wants about 18,000 -- many of them at every major transportation hub, helping the visitors find their way around. Kelly is counting on the many entertainment options in the New York/New Jersey region -- from Broadway to the museums to the long list of restaurants -- to make the week special for fans. Some of the problems that occurred in smaller Super Bowl cities such as Indianapolis and Jacksonville, including long lines at most dining options and a scarcity of taxis, are not a concern. But the New York/New Jersey bid is combating more than just Mother Nature to make it successful. Fans generally attend an event like this to be around others like themselves. They take over a city like New Orleans for the week. Will New York swallow the game whole? The city hopes it has a solution -- something called ""Super Bowl Boulevard,"" a massive fan event in Manhattan from January 29 to February 1 that will feature nightly concerts, NFL-theme exhibits and even the Lombardi Trophy. Still, with the teams practicing in New Jersey and the game and game-day events across the Hudson River, Kelly knows most fans will have to rely on public transportation. ""If you can make the fan comfortable, feeling safe and feeling welcome, and there's a lot to do, I think that makes a great Super Bowl experience,"" Kelly said. ""I don't know how much the game is the draw. The game is the great enabler -- it creates all of this -- but whether the Super Bowl is exciting or not exciting, they still want to come back to it and the experience that surrounds it."" Goodell is counting on it. He admitted that the success or failure of the New York/New Jersey game will affect where the NFL places its big event in the future. Glendale, Arizona, will host the game in 2015, while the 2016 host -- Miami or San Francisco -- will be announced on May 22. ""The game of football is made to be played in the elements,"" Goodell said. ""Now, we hope they're not extreme, but we'll be prepared for that if that's the case. Some of our most classic games were played in extreme weather conditions. You know them all: The Ice Bowl. Some of the games that I look back as a fan and say, 'That was fun.'"" Will Super Bowl XLVIII end up on that list? Or will a winter storm make that 34-minute power outage in New Orleans seem like a happy moment in NFL history by comparison?","Steve Politi: Superdome power outage sets stage for next year's Super Bowl in N.J.

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- Spain's capital may not be causing shivers to Monaco's famed Monte Carlo casino just yet, but Madrid hopes to muscle in on Europe's appetite for gambling. The first phase of a controversial, multi-billion dollar casino and hotel complex that Spaniards are calling ""EuroVegas"" is scheduled to open in 2017 in the Madrid suburb of Alcorcon, about eight miles southwest of the city center. A top executive from Las Vegas Sands Corporation -- founded and run by American billionaire political activist Sheldon Adelson -- unveiled the exact location of its large complex during a news conference on Friday. The new resort could bring tens of thousands of new jobs to recession-gripped Spain as it lures travelers hungry for a taste of Vegas in Europe. Opponents say the Vegas-style resort would create only low-skilled and low-paying jobs -- not the development model needed to put Spain get back on its feet economically. They also have concerns that the resort would attract organized crime. At Friday's packed news conference, Las Vegas Sands chief operating officer Michael Leven said he's confident of securing financing for the first phase of the project, which would cost approximately $9 billion and include 12,000 hotel rooms. Las Vegas Sands is financing $3.6 billion, or 40%, of the cost of the first phase, and Leven said he has ""assurances from many banks"" about financing the remaining 60%. But an aide later said that no contracts have been signed yet. That may be because Las Vegas Sands must still formally compete to win the right to build the development through an open public bid process. That process opens in March, officials said, and results should be announced by September. If the company wins the bid, groundbreaking could begin by the end of this year. Leven said the first phase could easily generate some tens of thousands of jobs, based on the company's experience at its similar, but smaller, gambling resort in Singapore. A company spokeswoman later said the entire $22 billion project, when completed over 20 years, could create 250,000 jobs. Las Vegas Sands' CEO Adelson has built the company into a leading global developer of gambling, entertainment and convention resorts. It owns The Venetian and The Palazzo gambling resorts in Las Vegas, Nevada, and has expanded into Asian markets, including resorts in Singapore and Macau. Last September, Adelson announced that he'd chosen Madrid, instead of Barcelona, as the site for the project in Spain. That set off months of debate over which of three potential locations in the Madrid area would get the nod, something that was finally resolved publicly on Friday. Las Vegas Sands had previously said that the resort's access to Madrid's international airport was a priority. Yet, the suburb of Alcorcon and the airport are located on opposite sides of city center. Spanish authorities are considering rail links between the airport and the resort, Madrid regional government president Ignacio Gonzalez said Friday, although such a plan would require input from Spain's national government. Another detail being worked out is whether visitors to Madrid's ""EuroVegas"" resort will be able to light up, something that's commonplace inside the large casinos on the Vegas Strip. Spain has strict no-smoking laws in public places and the national government would have to grant a special waiver to allow smoking in the casino resort.","Company announces exact Madrid location for upcoming Vegas-style casino resort .

"(CNN) -- I heard on the news that Junior Seau passed away. Seau, 43, ended his life last Wednesday. He did so as purposefully and violently as he played the game of football. Today, a public memorial is planned for him at Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego. Junior, like my former teammate Andre Waters and friend Dave Duerson, both of whom also committed suicide, played the game as they were taught, with reckless abandon. These guys didn't just tackle opponents; they ran through them, never applying the brakes before collision. And they did what all great athletes do: They learned to play with pain. ESPN analyst Marcellus Wiley, a former teammate of Seau with the San Diego Chargers, said of Junior that ""he never let you see his pain."" He also said that Junior would not get treatment with his teammates but would do so privately, so he was seen only at full strength. The recent spate of suicides committed by former players has the NFL and the entire sports world examining the cumulative impact of concussions over the span of a career and a lifetime. The emerging research on chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) has helped identify at least one culprit in the uncharacteristically fatal behavior of men who lived by the creed, ""never give up."" But inherent in that creed is a zero sum mentality that teaches us all to ""play with pain."" This also means that we learned to live with pain. Together with CTE, this is a lethal combination that can be very difficult to see, unless we change our lens. When I received the news about Junior, I had just walked out of my daughter's second-grade classroom. A few dads were helping with a craft for Mother's Day. While in class, I complained to another dad about the painful decision of saving my back or my knees while assisting children with their cutting and gluing. I knew the source of my physical pain, and it is a constant reminder of a proud football career. I accept that I gave my body to the game I love and every day I experience the consequences. That has long been the lament of former athletes: bad knees, bad back and nagging body aches are the battle scars of weekend warriors. During the drive home from school, I thought of the scars that riddle my body and mind. And, for the first time in the discussion of the life expectancy of NFL players, I saw myself. Junior is the 19th player that I played with or knew personally from college and professional football who is dead, all before 50. He is the fifth to commit suicide. Then I thought of Cover 8. In 1986, when I was a quarterback at Syracuse University, we installed a defensive formation called Cover 8. It moved the free safety, a position usually 18 yards away from the line of scrimmage, to just half that distance. The purpose was to stop the quarterback (me). Our free safety was Marcus Paul, now assistant strength coach for Super Bowl champs the New York Giants. For 20 days, we purposely and violently ran through each other several times a day. Each collision brought admiration, respect and a hardening of our resolve. We knew we were making each other better. If we survived each other, no opponent could pose a greater challenge. We played for another 10 years, but we still laugh about the ringing in the ears and the workman-like way we went at each other that spring, conditioning ourselves to raise our threshold for pain. We were young men demonstrating the rules of masculinity and sports. Ignore pain, leave it on the field and never back down. As a businessman, I know the merits of those qualities that transferred from my athletic career. But I wonder (and fear) as a man and as a person about what other physical and emotional qualities transferred? At what costs? And when will I find out? Women are twice as likely to attempt suicide but men are four times more successful. We both suffer from mental illness and seemingly insurmountable stress. But men are also less likely to show signs or ask for help. This leads to the ""if you can't fix it, force it"" approach that is evident in most violent acts committed by men. Sadly, there were signs with Junior, Andre, Dave and all the other players who have committed suicide. And, they knew it. What they didn't know was how to tell us. And, we didn't know how to see it in them. We assumed that they were like most players who find it hard to adjust to life outside the locker room, without the game. It's easy to see them as warriors without a war. It's harder to see them as men without capacity to say, ""I hurt and I need help."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Don McPherson.","Don McPherson: Football's Junior Seau, who committed suicide, to be memorialized today .

"(CNN) -- Sexual violence against female protestors at Cairo's Tahrir Square appears to be increasing, an activist group devoted to end such assaults said Tuesday. Operation Anti-Sexual Harassment/Assault said it intervened in 15 of 19 reported sexual assaults on Friday when 10,000 people gathered in the square on the two-year anniversary of the start of the revolution that ousted President Hosni Mubarak. ""These attacks represent a startling escalation of violence against women in Tahrir Square in terms of the number of incidents and the extremity of the violence which took place,"" the group said in a news release. The organization said some of the cases involved life-threatening violence where the attackers used knives or other weapons. It said some of its members also were attacked during rescue attempts. Egyptian official warns of state's collapse as protesters defy curfew . ""This phenomenon requires urgent attention and treatment, and is linked to the broader social problem of endemic and daily sexual harassment and assault of women,"" Operation Anti-Sexual Harassment/Assault said. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay called for Egypt President Mohamed Morsy to do something about the assaults and other violence against demonstrators. ""It is unacceptable and a dereliction of duty not to intervene when protesters are being attacked by thugs and when women are being raped and sexually assaulted,"" she said in a written statement. The streets around Cairo's Tahrir Square have been the sites of protests for days, including Friday's violent clashes. At least 29 people were treated for cuts, broken bones and birdshot injuries, Health Ministry spokesman Khaled El Khatib said. Six police officers were also hurt in the disorder near Tahrir Square, the Interior Ministry said.

"(CNN) -- A new country and a new start -- Rafael Nadal will cautiously embark on his long-awaited comeback tournament in Chile this week. The tennis star has not played a competitive match since losing in the second round at Wimbledon last June due to knee problems, and he is wary of pushing himself too hard in his first appearance at the Vina del Mar Open. ""I have to take it slowly and be humble to know that things won't be as good as they were before my injury. I need to be patient,"" the 11-time grand slam champion told reporters. ""I need weeks of working on the circuit. This is my first week and I don't think the goals are the same that the ones I will have in two more months."" Nadal is hoping to defend his French Open title yet again, aiming for an unprecedented eighth crown in Paris, but the Spaniard's 2013 preparations were ruined by a preseason illness that forced him to miss last month's Australian Open. He decided the skip the hard-court event and go straight to his favored clay surface, on which he will also play in a Brazilian tournament after Chile. ""I hope the tournament will help me to get the feeling I need to add week after week after a long period without competition ... results are the least important thing right now,"" said Nadal, who last week launched a smartphone app that teaches tennis skills. ""If my knee doesn't hurt I have no fear. I've had had more serious injuries in the past and I got stronger after them,"" he added. ""This is the injury that has sidelined me the longest so maybe it will take me a bit longer to get back my confidence, the good feeling on court, but if my knee doesn't hurt I don't see why I couldn't get back my movements and game style."" The 26-year-old will take to the court on Tuesday for a doubles match, then start his singles campaign the following day after receiving a first-round bye as the top seed in the draw despite slipping to fifth in the world rankings. Nadal met Chile's president Sebastian Pinera when he arrived on Friday, when he downplayed his chances of a victorious return. ""It was the best decision to come to a country for the first time. Vina del Mar has the surface I need. Losing in the first round is something that could happen, because I haven't played in such a long time,"" he said. Meanwhile, the man who last beat Nadal did not need to repeat his Saturday exertions as the Czech Republic reached the quarterfinals of the Davis Cup. Lukas Rosol had helped the defending champions take a 2-1 lead against Switzerland after a record-breaking seven-hour doubles clash, but his playing partner Tomas Berdych put the tie beyond the home team as he won Sunday's opening doubles rubber against Stanislas Wawrinka. Berdych triumphed 6-3 6-4 3-6 7-6 (7-5) in more than three hours against Wawrinka, who had beaten Rosol on Friday. ""It was an incredible weekend,"" Berdych said. ""Yesterday was a part of history and today was a really tough one. ""It was a team effort to get ready for the match and I was feeling good from the first point. If I'd lost the fourth set, I would have been able to keep going."" Jiri Vesely stood in for 73rd-ranked Rosol in the dead rubber, but lost to Henri Laaksonen. The Czechs will next travel to Kazakhstan, who beat Austria 3-1 after returning to the World Group via a playoff following last year's first-round whitewash against Spain. Kazakhstan defeated the Czechs 3-2 in the country's first top-flight appearance in 2011. Argentina will host France in another quarterfinal after both nations completed 5-0 victories on Sunday, against Germany and Israel respectively. Novak Djokovic's Serbia will play either the U.S. or Brazil after beating Belgium 3-2, having lost Sunday's two dead rubbers as the world No. 1 and Viktor Troicki were rested. Italy edged Croatia 3-2 to earn a clash with Canada, who upset last year's losing finalists Spain to reach the last eight for the first time. Fabio Fognini won the deciding match for Italy against Ivan Dodig, coming from behind to triumph 4-6 6-4 6-4 6-4. In Vancouver, Milos Raonic gave Canada an unbeatable 3-1 lead as he defeated Guillermo Garcia-Lopez 6-3 6-4 6-2 to end the hopes of five-time winners Spain -- missing Nadal, David Ferrer, Nicolas Almagro and Fernando Verdasco. On the women's tour, Mona Barthel won her second WTA title after upsetting top seed Sara Errani in the final of the Paris Open. The 22-year-old won 7-5 7-6 (7-4) against the 2012 French Open runner-up as she followed up earlier victories over third seed Marion Bartoli and No. 5 Roberta Vinci. The 45-ranked German denied her more experienced Italian opponent a seventh career title, hitting 53 winners to 16 but making 50 unforced errors to 18. Russia's Maria Kirilenko won her sixth title by edging German fifth seed Sabine Lisicki 5-7 6-1 7-6 (7-1) at the Pattaya Open, having lost in the final of the Thai event last year.","Former world No. 1 Rafael Nadal will return this week after a seven-month injury absence .
