"Southampton boss Ronald Koeman has confirmed his interest in Galatasaray midfielder Wesley Sneijder but has revealed the south coast side would not be able to afford his wages. Sportsmail revealed earlier this week that Premier League duo Manchester United and Southampton were planning to tempt the Holland star away from Turkey during the January transfer window. Sneijder is desperate to quit Galatasaray at the start of the year and they are said to be keen on offloading the 30-year-old playmaker, who earns around £90,000-a-week. Southampton are interested in Galatasaray star Wesley Sneijder - but they cannot afford his wages . Manchester United and Southampton have been informed about the midfielder's availability . Ronald Koeman confirmed his interest in Sneijder ahead of his side's league match against Everton . Newly-appointed chairman Duygun Yarsuvat has been handed the task of easing the club's precarious financial position and Sneijder's apparent £2.5million wages are said to be an issue. However Koeman, who shares the same agent as his fellow Dutchman, has stressed Sneijder's hefty wage demands are out of Southampton's budget. Koeman, speaking ahead of the Saints' Premier League encounter against Everton, said: 'I am interested but we can't pay him. 'I know that because his agent is my agent. There is nothing in that. Seriously.' Southampton's stance will boost Manchester United's chances of signing Sneijder if Louis van Gaal wants to link back up with the Dutchman. It is understood Galatasaray will demand in the region of £9m for Sneijder.

"The Tottenham Hotspur Supporters' Trust have slammed the Football Association's 'extremely disappointing' decision to schedule the club's FA Cup third-round tie away at Burnley for a Monday night - and have also accused the governing body of 'damaging the magic of the cup'. The match has been scheduled for 7.45pm on Monday, January 5, meaning that the only way supporters can return to London is by taking a bus which arrives back at White Hart Lane at 4am. Train travel back to London from Turf Moor is not a viable option because fans would be forced to leave at half-time to ensure they made it in time. Tottenham Hotspur fans will only be able to return from facing Burnley at Turf Moor in the FA Cup third round on a Monday night via a coach that gets back to White Hart Lane at 4am . And in a statement on their website (which can read below in full), the THST have reacted in frustration to both the FA's scheduling and Virgin Trains' inability to provide a chartered train that could have been financed through the Away Fans' Initiative. The THST claim that it is their 'understanding' that both Spurs and Burnley were willing to play on Sunday, January 4 - despite this being just three days after Tottenham host Chelsea at White Hart Lane and Burnley play Newcastle United at St James' Park - but that the FA have scheduled it for the Monday instead. In a final pay-off to the statement, the THST said: 'We will continue to press for answers from the Police and the FA, and have made the point to THFC that fuller explanations of decisions would help the relationship with fans. 'Once again, the football authorities' actions make the fine words about giving the fans more consideration appear little more than lip service. We await answers to our questions from the FA and the Police. And we will update supporters further when we receive them.' Nacer Chadli celebrates putting Spurs 2-0 up against Newcastle United on Wednesday evening . 'The scheduling of the FA Cup third round tie away at Burnley has, understandably, prompted protests from Spurs fans. Our supporters are faced with a long trip on the evening of, what will be for many, the first working day of the year. The last scheduled train leaves Burnley for London at half time. And those travelling by coach will need to find their own way back from White Hart Lane at 4am in the morning. 'THST made clear its response to the scheduling of the tie. Since then, we have been in conversation with THFC and the football authorities to find out why the tie was scheduled at the most inconvenient time for Spurs supporters, and what could be done to mitigate that inconvenience. There has been lots of rumour and speculation since the announcement was made and, as always, we've tried to establish the facts before making comment. Questions are still outstanding but we feel supporters deserve to be updated, so this is the situation as we currently understand it. We appreciate the patience of the many fans who have contacted us on this matter. 'We understand the scheduling of fixtures over the holiday period presented challenges, especially with Spurs playing at home to Chelsea on 1 Jan. In previous conversations with the FA and the Premier League we have, alongside other fan organisations, frequently questioned the way the scheduling of live games impacts upon fans, and this is a prime example of the problem. We appreciate, too, that the playing and coaching staff must ensure there is appropriate recovery time between games. But scheduling the game on Sunday 4 January would have meant the game was played three days after the Chelsea match, and at a time when it would have easier for travelling supporters to attend. 'Our understanding is that both Burnley and Spurs were happy for the game to go ahead on 4 January. But, as the Club's statement said, there were ""police and stewarding issues"" that meant Sunday was not possible. We have asked the Club to clarify what those issues were. We have yet to receive a reply. We have also contacted Lancashire Police to ask what those issues were. We have yet to receive a reply. 'The possibility of a cup tie between Accrington Stanley and Manchester United on the 4 January has been mentioned frequently as a possible reason why the Burnley v Spurs tie could not go ahead on that day. We have asked Lancashire Police if it is true that they did not have the resources to deal with two football matches in the same county on the same day. We have yet to receive a reply. 'In the event, Accrington Stanley were knocked out of the cup, meaning there will be no match at Accrington on 4 Jan. The Yeovil v Accrington Stanley game was played on the evening that the date of the Burnley v Spurs tie was finally announced. It's possible this is because the FA insisted a decision was made on that morning, rather than waiting until the outcome of the Accrington tie was known. We have asked the FA if this was the case. We have yet to receive a reply. 'If the scheduling of the tie for 5 Jan was as a result of the FA's insistence that a decision was made before the outcome of the Accrington tie, we would find that extremely disappointing. In numerous discussions with the FA, we have made the point about the effect of kick-off schedules on fans, and the FA has promised to bear this in mind in order to preserve 'the magic of the cup'. The FA also acknowledged that playing ties after the draw for the next round has been made damages the 'magic of the cup'. And yet this is the situation that we will be in again this year, possibly as a direct result of the FA's action. 'After making clear our objections to the scheduling of the tie, we also sought to find the best possible solution for fans who did want to travel. We asked for the possibility of chartering a train, paid for from the Away Fans' Initiative, to be looked into. This train would have taken six hours each way to ferry supporters to and from the game at a cost approaching £40,000. Virgin Trains were also unable and unwilling to provide rolling stock. We asked for the possibility of air travel to be looked at. This would have cost a six-figure sum to take just 120 fans to the game. 'So we are stuck with coach travel, taking at least a day's leave, and significant onward travel difficulties. After securing our full allocation, after being denied this for last year's third round tie, and securing a price of £20 for tickets, we had hoped to announce some positive news about this tie. But the timing issue has largely negated that. 'We will continue to press for answers from the Police and the FA, and have made the point to THFC that fuller explanations of decisions would help the relationship with fans. 'Once again, the football authorities' actions make the fine words about giving the fans more consideration appear little more than lip service. We await answers to our questions from the FA and the Police. And we will update supporters further when we receive them.'","Tottenham Hotspur face Burnley at Turf Moor on Monday, January 5 at 7.45pm in the FA Cup third round .

"Every gamer has lost their cool on at least one occasion after being beaten by a friend in a tense match - and one of the current all-conquering Real Madrid side got so frustrated on the PS4 that he smashed a controller. Right back Dani Carvajal could not contain his frustration at losing a match on Thursday, with the result being that a large part of the device - including one joystick and the motion pad - broke off the front.

"Gregg Wallace once christened himself 'the cooking woman's crumpet' and only last year boasted about how younger women throw themselves at him. These days, the Masterchef presenter is almost as well known for his relationship history as he is for his long-running slot on the cookery show. Today, the 50-year-old star announced that he is engaged to marry for a fourth time - to his girlfriend Anne-Marie Sterpini, 29. Scroll down for video . Gregg Wallace, 50, claims that he has never been happier than with his new fiancée Anne-Marie Sterpini, 29. The couple have been together since March 2013. It is the fourth marriage for Gregg, who has openly spoken of his longing to find the woman he can settle down with forever . The couple have declared themselves completely in love and friends of the stars say that he has never been happier. So has the greengrocer from Peckham finally found the woman he can settle down with? The pair will certainly be hoping that romantic history won't be repeating itself. After five decades, he has notched up three marriages, several very public declarations of love and thousands of column inches of mud-slinging from  exes. More recently, he has got a bit of a reputation as a man with an eye for women several years his junior, with whom he indulges in very public Twitter flirtations. But while that was not always his preference, Gregg has always managed to make waves with his relationship style. He married his first wife Christine in 1991, aged just 24, while he was an up-and-coming greengrocer doing business in London's Covent Garden. Gregg made his name on Masterchef, which he has been presenting alongside John Torode since 2005 . The couple got hitched in a 20-minute ceremony and celebrated with a meal in a pie and mash shop around the corner. The marriage lasted just six weeks. In his autobiography, Life On A Plate, Gregg joked that the union was, 'possibly the shortest marriage in the world,' and admitted that he knew it was a mistake even before they said 'I do'. Two years later in 1993, he met his second wife Denise, who worked as a pastry chef in The Sanctuary Club in Covent Garden, and they had a whirlwind romance that resulted in their birth of their son Tom in 1994. Then three years later, their daughter Libby was born. Despite having two children, the couple didn't actually marry until 1999. They then divorced in 2004 after Gregg was caught having an affair with one of his employees. Denise was so affected by the break-up that she was hospitalised for three months and Gregg was granted full custody of their two children. She later said of the break-up: 'I was a nervous wreck. A complete mess.' Denise pulled no punches in 2009, when she gave a warts-and-all account of her marriage to the TV star in the now-defunct News of The World. Gregg married his second wife Denise in 1999, the couple had two children together . Gregg had previously claimed that Denise turned a blind eye to his philandering, so long as he was home before the children woke up in the morning. But in the interview, Denise claimed that Gregg even told her he had slept with a prostitute while they were together and that he used to collect spanking magazines, which he stored in fruit boxes at the back of their garage. The emotions were clearly still raw even earlier this year, when she told The Mirror: 'I wish I never married that man. He has been the bane of my life. 'If you met him, you’d think he was a really nice guy. He’s very charming and personable. But the real Gregg is horrible.' After their divorce in 2004, Gregg moved to Whitstable with their two children. While he spoke briefly about girlfriends in interviews, they stayed out of the limelight. That all changed in 2009, when he met Heidi Brown, who at 27 was 17 years his junior. She tweeted the TV star, asking if he knew that he had been called a 'weird crush' in a magazine. He replied: 'Ever visit London? Give me a call, I'll buy you lunch.' A few weeks later, her took her as his date to the Baftas. Just a few months into the romance, Heidi quit her job as Head Of Biology at a school near Carlisle and moved into the Kent home that Gregg shared with his two children. Gregg credited third wife Heidi Brown with overhauling his diet and helping him to cut down his drinking, as well as providing a stable family life for his two children . He credited her with overhauling his diet and helping him to cut down his drinking, as well as providing a stable family life. He said in an interview at the time: 'She’s way out of my league, but she loves me. I couldn’t be without her. Never, ever, ever.' The couple married in an extravagant wedding at five-star Coworth Park hotel in Ascot, Berkshire, and sold the pictures to Hello! magazine for £60,000. But just 14 months later, in March 2012, the couple announced that they were divorcing. Gregg was so heartbroken over the split that he sought counselling and he claimed that if it was up to him, they would never have broken up. He told the Mail at the time: 'I’m gutted with what’s happened, but we’re very different people. ‘I want to be out on the town. I crave company. 'I want to take my sexy, elegant wife to smart restaurants dressed up in her heels on my arm. 'She likes the local Italian.' Despite the split, Heidi stayed on for a while at their Whitstable home to look after Gregg's children, while he moved into a two-bedroom flat in London. It was just three months later, while he was still getting over his marriage to Heidi, that Gregg met glamour model Carla Franco. The 26-year-old bumped into him at the Ideal Home Show Show in Glasgow and much like with Heidi, their flirting started on Twitter. 26-year-old Carla Franco first met Gregg at the Ideal Home Show Show in Glasgow, they dated for five months . She messaged the star afterwards, saying: 'Thought I would follow you, be rude not to.' The tweets escalated, with Gregg at one point telling Carla that she 'could be the next Mrs Wallace'. She later revealed that Heidi had actually been complicit in her relationship with the TV star and that she had even rung Carla to arrange travel and timings for her first date with Gregg. But the relationship only last five months, with Gregg ending the romance after admitting that he hadn't gotten over Heidi. In an interview with The Sun, Carla claimed that he had constantly compared her to his ex-wife. He even told the Sunday Mirror while they were dating: 'Heidi was perfect. It’s not often you find a model who’s also a ­biology teacher. 'She had everything, beauty and intelligence.' Just four months after his split with Carla, Gregg had once again fallen in love though - this time with his now-fiancee Anne-Marie Sterpini, now 28. Anne-Marie, from Coventry, moved into the star's London home just a few months after they met . The couple also met on Twitter and Anne-Marie, from Coventry, moved into the star's London home just a few months later. They have now been together for more than a year and a half and Gregg claims that he has never been happier. Despite some negative headlines in August 2012, when Gregg punched a fellow party-goer at a dinner he was hosting  at the Wood Norton Hotel in Evesham, Worcestershire, for allegedly touching his girlfriend, the couple are said to be very much in love. Gregg admitted that he can sometimes be embarrassed about the age gap between him and his new love and that he doesn't like to hold her hand in public places like shopping centres in case people stare, but other than that, he claims that he has finally found his one true love. He told The Daily Mail last year: '‘Do you know when I knew I really, really liked her? 'It was when her piles of clothes, and the mess she was making in the flat, made me smile. It didn’t annoy me. ‘Everyone else’s stuff has annoyed me. I’ve spent my life thinking: “What is that doing in my wardrobe? Why is that on the window? That shouldn’t be on the floor"". ‘With her, I like it.'","Gregg Wallace once christened himself 'the cooking woman's crumpet'

"A United Nations official says one of the two Austrian girls who fled their middle class homes in Vienna earlier this year to fight in Syria has definitely died in the conflict. The two Viennese girls, Samra Kesinovic, 17, and 15-year-old Sabina Selimovic, whose parents are Bosnian refugees, disappeared in April after saying that they wanted to fight in Syria. They first went to the Turkish capital Ankara by plane, and then on into the southern Turkish region of Adana. After that, their tracks were lost. Scroll down for video . The teens appeared on social networking sites branding Kalashnikov rifles and surrounded by armed men . But they appeared on social networking sites branding Kalashnikov rifles and surrounded by armed men - photos which Austrian police said acted as recruitment posters for young girls. David Scharia, a senior Israeli expert of the United Nations Security Council's Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTED) said: 'We received information just recently about two 15-year-old girls, of Bosnian origin, who left Austria, where they had been living in recent years; and everyone, the families and the intelligence services of the two countries, is looking for them. He added: 'Both were recruited by Islamic State. One was killed in the fighting in Syria, the other has disappeared.' His confirmation comes three months after the Austrian government said it had informed both sets of parents of the girls that one of them might have been killed. The two Viennese girls, Samra Kesinovic (left), 16, and 15-year-old Sabina Selimovic (right), whose parents are Bosnian refugees, disappeared in April after saying that they wanted to fight in Syria . It is believed both Samra and Sabina married IS fighters soon after they arrived in Syria from Turkey . An Islamic preacher from Bosnia living in Vienna, Mirsad O., known by the Islamic name of 'Ebu Tejma', was allegedly responsible for the radicalization of the two young girls. Authorities say he brainwashed them into joining the jihad. He denies this. Mirsad O. was arrested for his role in an alleged terrorist funding network based in Austria in November. It is believed both Samra and Sabina married IS fighters soon after arriving in Syria. The two couples initially lived in the same room but the 15-year-old has reportedly now moved out to a different flat. Speaking by SMS messages to French weekly Paris Match, Sabina denied claims she was pregnant and insisted she was enjoying life in Syria, where she felt free to practise her religion in a way that she did not in Austria. An Islamic preacher from Bosnia living in Vienna, Mirsad O., known by the Islamic name of 'Ebu Tejma', was allegedly responsible for the radicalization of the two young girls . The magazine did manage to confirm the teenager had only been allowed to speak to them with the permission of her husband, who was in the room as she wrote her answers. She said after arriving to Turkey from Austria they crossed over the border into Syria on foot. They ended up in the city of Raqqa, she said, after arriving in the country with nothing other than the clothes they were wearing. Sabina said her husband was a soldier and added: 'Here I can really be free. I can practice my religion. I couldn't do that in Vienna.' Sabina (left) said after arriving to Turkey from Austria she and Samra (right) crossed over the border into Syria on foot. They ended up in the city of Raqqa, after arriving in the country with nothing other than the clothes they were wearing . As many as 130 people from Austria are now believed to be fighting as jihadists abroad. Experts say at least half of them originally come from the Caucasus region of Russia and were granted asylum in Austria after the bloody Chechen war. Austrian Interior Ministry spokesman Alexander Marakovits said they were noticing an increasing problem with youngsters wanting to leave the country to fight in the ranks of ISIS. He said: 'If we can catch them before they leave we have the chance to work with their parents and other institutions to bring the youngsters out of the sphere of influence that prompted them to act in this way the first place. 'Once they have left the country, even if they then changed their minds, it is then almost impossible to get them back.'

"Amir Khan triumphantly returned home to his gym in Bolton and, after being confronted by a huge mural of himself, laughed off suggestions he is not a big enough name to face Floyd Mayweather. The welterweight  - fresh from his victory over Devon Alexander - arrived in England on Wednesday and  addressed the media on Thursday at his Gloves Community Centre in Bolton. Khan posed for pictures in front of a giant mural of himself in his refurbished gym and with the 24-carat shorts he wore during his emphatic win over Alexander last Saturday. Amir Khan has announced that he will donate the £30,000 shorts he wore during his last week to charity . Khan posted two pictures of his refurbished gym and clothes from his fight with Devon Alexander on Thursday . Khan was all smiles as he talked to the assembled press at his gym in Bolton . Khan is hoping his next fight will be against Floyd Mayweather next year . Khan put on his own gold-standard display against Alexander and won much praise on both sides of the Atlantic. He has been vocal in his desire to face  Mayweather in his next fight, but the pound-for-pound king poured cold water on the idea and has called out Manny Pacquiao. 'The other night I think he did 4,000 (attendance), so, Amir Khan, his name holds no weight,' Mayweather told reporters during the World Boxing Council convention. 'No one knows who Amir Khan is, except for people who are involved in boxing.' But Khan has hit back saying, 'I want the fight, but is Floyd going to take the fight? Is Floyd going to give me that chance? That's something we're all waiting to hear from Floyd Mayweather. 'I've been asking for the fight for the last two or three years. Now he needs to come back to the press and say, ""I want the fight with Amir Khan"". I know I'm touching distance away from that super fight. I think I've proven myself many times and I think this time I've proved myself in the biggest way so he has to take the fight. What else do I have to do? 'I have a bigger name than (Marcos) Maidana did or Victor Ortiz. I'm one of the biggest names in boxing. I know if I can bring Floyd Mayweather to Britain then I'll sell out Wembley Stadium. How big does he need my name to be? 'I think these are little excuses. I'm sure people realise that. It seems to me he doesn't want to fight me. I have the speed, dexterity, accuracy, movement, power; I think it's something that he doesn't really want to mix with.' Khan lands a left hand during his impressive win on decision against Alexander . Khan arrived back in Manchester along with his wife and daughter on Wednesday . Mayweather says Khan's 'name holds no weight' and that he will not fight him . The chance to face Mayweather has been something Khan has long wanted. He pulled out of his original fight with Alexander last year because he believed he had a May date with the Money Man. However, Mayweather instead fought Marcos Maidana, leaving Britain's former Olympic silver medallist without a fight in 14 months before he took on Luis Collazo in May. Khan says he will not make the same mistakes and will fight in May regardless of whether Mayweather says yes or no. However, it seems unlikely that he will take on IBF champion Kell Brook in a battle of Britain. He said: 'I'm not really interested in the Kell Brook fight. I'm looking at the biggest names in boxing. Floyd Mayweather, Manny Pacquiao, I think that's where I belong. It is probable that Mayweather will insist on fighting Pacquiao, an eight-division champion, in his adopted hometown of Las Vegas . FLOYD MAYWEATHER . Age 37 . Born Michigan, USA .

'If the fight doesn't happen with Floyd then maybe Manny Pacquiao is another option. I'd like to fight in May to keep myself busy and sharp. I think that helps me. 'It's very frustrating. It's just a waiting game. But this time I'm not going to wait and pull out of a fight. If it's not Mayweather, then I'm going to have to look at other opponents, but if it is Mayweather then I'm going to grab it with both hands and put on a great performance. 'I really believe I can beat him. The way I fought and the way I'm learning, I'm getting better and stronger. I really believe I have his number and maybe Floyd knows that as well.' Meanwhile, Khan's shorts - at £30,000 the most expensive in sporting history - will be donated to charity to help raise money for the school in Pakistan where 132 schoolchildren were shot dead by the Taliban on Tuesday. Khan added: 'I'm going to be donating them towards what happened in Pakistan. I want to rebuild the school and strengthen the security over there.'","Amir Khan back in UK after win over Devon Alexander in Las Vegas last Saturday .

"It’s the most wonderful time of the year on Earth - but it seems the universe, too, knows how to throw a good festive party. A stunning image released by Nasa has shown a kaleidoscope of colour as two colliding galaxies put on a spectacular light show. But while impressive to look at, the image also has scientific value - revealing a large number of super-bright sources of X-rays that may indicate a new type of black hole. Scientists in Massachusetts and Texas have revealed a spectacular light show taking place in two colliding galaxies (shown). The galaxies in question are NGC 2207 and IC 2163, which are 130 million light-years from Earth in Canis Major . The two galaxies in the image, NGC 2207 and IC 2163, are located about 130 million light-years from Earth in the constellation of Canis Major, and together measure 180,000 light-years across. The image is a combination of data from three telescopes: the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the Hubble Space Telescope and the Spitzer Space Telescope. Colliding galaxies like the pair featured in the image are well known to contain intense star formation. Shock waves, like the sonic booms from supersonic aircraft, form during the collision, leading to the collapse of clouds of gas and the formation of star clusters. In fact, researchers estimate that the stars associated with the ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are very young and may only be about 10 million years old. In contrast, our Sun is about halfway through its 10-billion-year lifetime. It was compiled by scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge and the Harvard Medical School in Boston (all in Massachusetts), and the Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas. Chandra is used to spot X-rays coming from the galaxy, which appear pink in the image. The reason there is so much pink is that the galaxies contain one of the most numerous collections ever found of so-called ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs). Both galaxies, like our own Milky Way, contain a number of star systems called X-ray binaries. These consist of a star in a tight orbit around either a neutron star or a small black hole with about the mass of our sun - like the one seen in the movie Interstellar. These systems emit a large amount of X-rays, but ULXs - of which both galaxies have many - are far brighter. Why they are so much brighter than regular X-ray binaries is not well understood, but it might be caused by a larger than normal black hole - an as yet unconfirmed medium-sized one - orbiting each star. In total 28 ULXs have been spotted in the two galaxies. The pink colour in the image shows X-ray emissions from superbright sources (shown up close), believed to be stars around black holes. Intense regions of star formation are also revealed in the image, which uses data from three telescope . The image is a combination of data from three telescopes: the Chandra X-ray Observatory (illustration shown), the Hubble Space Telescope and the Spitzer Space Telescope . Elsewhere in the image, Hubble’s optical data appears in blue, white, orange and brown, while infrared data from Spitzer appears red. From the data, scientists have found a strong correlation between the number of X-ray sources and the rate at which stars are forming in any given region. In the spiral arms of the galaxies, for example, comparatively large amounts of stars are forming in similar regions to the ULXs. The correlation suggests the stars in the binary systems with black holes are young and massive, emitting huge amounts of radiation.

"It's the fitness craze that sees volunteers pay good money to be screamed at by drill sergeants. But one military-style boot camp has left more than just its customers feeling sore. Craig and Paula Williams charge up to £1,000 a week for gruelling training sessions on the grounds of their Grade II-listed home – but their wealthy neighbours claim that life in their quiet hamlet has been ruined by the constant screeching of the couple's fitness instructors. Scroll down for video . Former Royal Marine Craig Williams, 37, and his wife Paula, 36, run the military fitness centre in the hamlet . The bootcamp, in the grounds of the couple's Grade II listed home, has attracted criticism from neighbours . Residents have complained that the camp, set up last year, is too loud and creates too much traffic. The bootcamp has attracted the likes of James Argent from TOWIE and Binky Felstead, from Made in Chelsea . Residents in Heydour, in Oasby, Lincolnshire, where property prices start at £900,000, now want to see the business shut down. One local, who did not wish to be named, said: 'Since the boot camp arrived my life has become miserable. 'There was a time when my partner and I enjoyed the peace and tranquillity this area has to offer. We both work hard and have been rewarded with a certain level of lifestyle, which we are not ashamed about. 'What we do not appreciate is our world being disturbed by what can only be described as a drill sergeant screaming commands to overweight people as they struggle to touch their toes.' Former Royal Marine Mr Williams, 37, launched TEAM Bootcamp with his wife, 36, after spending 15 years in the military. It is based at their home, Heydour House, a ten-bedroom former rectory worth £1million. Built in 1857, it boasts a four-acre garden, including a tennis court. The firm's website claims that clients can lose 8-11lb per week 'in a safe and secluded environment free from the trials of day-to-day life'. All of the boot camp's fitness instructors have served in the Forces. Disgruntled residents have claimed the bootcamp in the grounds of the house has made their lives miserable . The couple charge customers up to £1,000-a-week for a course which includes gruelling Army-style circuits . Calum Best (pictured) is another celebrity who has attended the bootcamp in the quiet hamlet . The business opened this summer – but the owners did not apply for planning permission until weeks after it began operating. Heydour is a picturesque hamlet mentioned in the Domesday Book. It is situated nine miles north-east of Grantham in Lincolnshire. It has a Grade-I listed Anglican parish church dedicated to St Michael which originates from the 12th century. The hamlet's school was closed in 1983 and the nearest post office and shop is two miles away in Wilsford. Heydour House, where the Team Bootcamp is based, is a former rectory built in 1857 which was given a Grade-II listed status in 1984. The ten-bedroom property boasts a four-acre garden with a tennis court and a grand entrance hall complete with a stone archway. On their website, Team Bootcamp boast that clients can lose 8-11 lbs per week 'in a safe and secluded environment free from the trials of day-to-day life.' They are currently running half price winter week-long camps which cost charge £449 for shared accommodation, with clients paying £547 for a twin room or £597 for a single room. Since it opened, it has attracted celebrities such as Binky Felstead, Calum Best and The Only Way is Essex's James Argent. This week the application was deferred, after more than two dozen letters of objection were sent by disgruntled locals. They complain that loud music regularly blared out from the site is 'affecting the environment', and say the camp's popularity has seen the previously peaceful area overwhelmed with traffic. Parish council chairman Michael Bromige, 79, who lives half a mile away from the Williamses, said: 'The noise from the boot camp has been very intrusive, with music and shouted commands.' Neighbour Andy Soper added: 'The hamlet comprises our cemetery, church and eight houses. It is an extremely quiet area and the cemetery has always been a place of peace. There is a huge amount of intrusive noise from the boot camp, totally unsuitable for our small hamlet. It is upsetting for those visiting graves of loved ones.' Another local, Paul Richardson, told how clients often go on group runs around the village. 'I don't particularly like seeing [them],' he said. 'The building should be used for offices or something that doesn't affect other people.' Mr Williams, who has served in Afghanistan, Iraq and Sierra Leone, said: 'I am used to hostile environments all over the world. The feeling I get when I walk through the village is the same, it's not nice.' Despite the criticism, the couple are determined to carry on running the bootcamp from their home . Training days begin at 7am with a circuit session followed by a workout on the custom built obstacle course . The military-style camp in Heydour, near Grantham in Lincolnshire, is a regular haunt for TV stars . The couple plan to stay in the hamlet. 'We have taken great steps to reduce the noise, and have created a noise and disturbance management plan,' Mr Williams said. 'The noise does travel really well here and we are aware of it. We spend a lot of time and energy keeping on top of the noise and the complaints and we have stopped using music and our trainers from shouting.' Mrs Williams, who has always worked in the fitness industry, said: 'The lady next door says having a boot camp next door to her is devaluing her house. She doesn't like to look at it, it is all down to snobbery.' The couple both used to work for No.1 Bootcamp, a similar company used by Strictly Come Dancing finalist Mark Wright. Their new business offers packages which cover accommodation at Heydour House and outdoor exercise sessions on the property's grounds. South Kesteven District Council is due to make a final decision on whether the camp can stay open in the New Year.","Ex Royal Marine Craig Williams and wife Paula set up camp in Heydour .

"A new attraction where children as young as 13 fire military-grade weapons in zombie, gangster and cowboy-themed simulators has been slammed by gun control campaigners. Although management claim their Orlando, Florida, attraction provides a safe place for the use of firearms, critics claim it is unsuitable for an area known for its child-friendly attractions. The website for the business - named Machine Gun America - states it is Orlando's 'first automatic adrenaline attraction'. Scroll down for video . Machine Gun America (pictured) has been criticised for operating in an area that is historically family-friendly . The machine gun theme park caters to those aged 13 and up. Pictured is a woman firing an assault rifle at a target . Weapons available to be used adorn the walls of Machine Gun America's front counter . It explains: 'Whether you're looking to unleash your inner action star or become a zombie hunter, experience the exhilarating rush of shooting real machine guns and powerful firearms for a thrill like any other.' But Lucia Kay McBath, a member of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense, said: 'You've got Holy Land right there in Orlando. You've got Disney World, and Epcot. All places for family fun where they should feel protected,' WTSP reported. Machine Gun America's management claim it is an attraction, not a firing range, and customers cannot bring their own weapons to shoot. Guests must be 13 years old and no alcohol will be sold. Wes Doss,  Machine Gun America's safety and training officer, said it was unlike any other experience in the country. 'The live shooting experiences will include themed packages featuring some of the most famous firearms from around the world.' General Manager Bruce Nierenberg also defended accusations the attraction was unsuitable for children. 'No one ever shoots by themselves, and no guest is ever in control of the weapon without a range safety officer next to them and participating with them,' he told WTSP. Machine Gun America is located on West Irlo Bronson Memorial Highway (pictured), an area known for its family friendly attractions . The business is due to open on Saturday. In late August, a nine-year-old girl accidentally shot dead firing range instructor Charles Vacca, 39, after an Uzi she was firing recoiled upwards out of her grip. The shocking recording taken by the girl's parents and released by police shows Vacca standing closely next to the girl when the gun recoiled as she fired on full automatic mode. Mr Vacca died after being fatally struck in the head.","Machine Gun America bills itself as an 'automatic adrenaline attraction'

"Lewis Hamilton has admitted going to war with Nico Rosberg following their ignominious fall-out in Spa has helped push him to the edge of Formula One world title glory this season. Rosberg's decision not to back out of an accident with Mercedes team-mate Hamilton has proved highly damaging to his own championship chances. Although Hamilton retired that day and Rosberg went on to finish as runner-up to carve out a 29-point cushion, the ramifications of that day have been severe for the German. Lewis Hamilton says the 'war' between himself and Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg began in Spa .

Eventually coming clean - having initially denied his culpability over the incident - the 29-year-old Rosberg was given a severe dressing down by motorsport boss Toto Wolff and non-executive chairman Niki Lauda. What was described at the time as 'suitable disciplinary measures' were taken against Rosberg, whilst he was also forced to publicly apologise to Hamilton for his actions. Since then the tide has turned in the battle for the championship as Hamilton has won the last five races to open up a 24-point lead over Rosberg going into the last two races, with Brazil first on Sunday. Hamilton laps up the adulation from US fans after making it five victories in a row . The 29-year-old raises the trophy after racing to victory at the US Grand Prix in Austin, Texas . After what transpired at Spa, Hamilton concedes at no stage did he imagine his recent run of success, although it was that incident that put fire in his belly. 'You don't really look five or 10 races ahead. I've just always kept my head down, kept chipping away,' said Hamilton. 'I had those four wins (early in the season), and then there was the bad patch from Monaco onwards. 'Then Spa was like ""I'm going to turn this up. I'm going to have to turn this up. This means war"", that kind of feeling. Hamilton has split with media mogul Simon Fuller (R) who includes David Beckham among his clients . 'In reflecting on it, I turned the energy from that negative bomb into a positive.' It would be easy to believe on the back his 10th win of the year in the United States Hamilton now has a clear psychological edge over Rosberg. Rosberg certainly looked like a man who feared the writing to be on the wall post-race at the Circuit of the Americas. Hamilton, though, is too canny to believe Rosberg will think himself a beaten man, certainly not with the controversial double points on offer in the final race in Abu Dhabi on November 23. 'I'm not sure I do have an edge,' said Hamilton. 'Every weekend Nico resets, he comes in and qualifies on pole. He's massively strong mentally. He's still there, still fighting.'

"Unusual pancake shaped ice formations that are more typically seen in Arctic and Antarctic sea ice have been found floating on a river in Scotland. The dinner plate-sized ice 'pancakes' have formed on a quiet stretch of the River Dee in Aberdeenshire. The strange formations were photographed at the Lummels Pool, Birse, near Aboyne, by Jamie Urquhart, a biologist for the River Dee Trust. The dinner plate-sized ice pancakes were found in an area known as the Lummels Pool on the River Dee. Normally pancake form on ocean water or lakes around the Arctic circle where the movement of water keeps the ice from forming a flat sheet . The pancakes are thought to have formed from foam created by faster flowing water further upstream, accumulating in a corner of a pool. Freezing temperatures last week caused the foam to freeze, and the current bashed them into a circular shape. Normally pancakes form on ocean water or lakes around the Arctic circle where the movement of water keeps the ice from forming a flat sheet. Pancake ice normally forms in rough seas around the Arctic and Antarctic, but can form in some lakes and rivers. Tiny needle like crystals called frazil crystals rise to the surface and accumulate together. In calm water these typically form a greasy film that freezes into a flat surface ice. However, in rough or choppy water, these crystals congeal together into slushy circular disks. As these disks bump into each other and are buffeted by the water, they develop ridges and raised edges, giving them a distinctive dinner plate appearance. In the polar seas these can sometime have a thickness of up to 3.9 inches and  diameter of between 12 inches to nine feet. Eventually the plates fuse together to form consolidated sea ice that can have ridges that are up to 60 feet thick. However, they do ooccasionally occur on rivers when temperatures drop low enough. Officials at the Dee River Trust said it is the first time they have seen pancake ice form on the river. Mr Urquhart said: 'I’ve actually seen them before at the River Brora in Sutherland a couple of winters ago, but they were much smaller - more the size of a saucer. 'It’s the first time we’ve seen them at the Dee. They are quite a rare occurrence, the conditions have to be right for them to occur. 'I’ve spoken to a number of people across the catchment, the people on the river, such as the ghillies and anglers, who have never seen them here before. 'I don’t know if it’s because we’ve had more extreme winters over the last couple of years, and then that hard frost.' In the Arctic and Antarctic, pancake ice usually forms in rough seas, which prevent tiny crystals of ice, known as frazil crystals, that rise to the surface from bonding together. Instead, the needle-like crystals accumulate into slushy circular disks. The edges around the perimetre of each disk becomes raised as the pancakes bump into each other from the movement of the ocean waves. The ice pancakes were around an inch thick and the size of a dinner plate on the River Dee in Aberdeenshire. In the Arctic and Antarctic, pancake ice usually forms in rough seas, which prevent tiny crystals of ice, known as frazil crystals, that rise to the surface from bonding together . The pancakes accumulated downstream of faster water that is thought to have created foam, that then froze. It is thought that particularly hard frosts last week helped to cause the disks to form, but experts are baffled as to why they have not been seen on the river before in previous years . The strange formations were photographed at the Lummels Pool, Birse, near Aboyne (marked), by Jamie Urquhart, a biologist for the River Dee Trust . In the Arctic, these can bond together to form ridges that pile on top of each other and reach up to 60ft (18 metres) thick in places. It is thought that particularly hard frosts last week helped to cause the disks to form but they are baffled as to why they have not been seen on the river before in previous years. Joanna Dick, a spokesman for the River Dee Trust, said: 'We think foam floating about on the water started to freeze, probably at night. 'Bits of frozen foam got pushed around in the eddy, and in the ensuing collisions, became roughly circular. 'Perhaps each disc grew when smaller pieces of unfrozen foam struck the disc, adhered and then froze in place.” Joanna Dick, a spokesman for the River Dee Trust, said: 'We think foam floating about on the water started to freeze, probably at night. Bits of frozen foam got pushed around in the eddy, and in the ensuing collisions, became roughly circular' Pancake ice in Antarctica's Ross Sea can form plates that are between a foot (12-inches) and nine feet (108 inches) in diameter .","Biologists photographed the dinner plate-sized circles of ice on a quiet pool of the River Dee in Aberdeenshire after heavy frosts .

"There is a new hot young thing taking the Championship by storm. Here Sportsmail tells you all you need to know about this exciting teenage talent. Who is this whippet winger at Birmingham I’m hearing about? Demarai Gray is his name. His reputation has been bubbling away for a season or so but he announced himself to the Championship with a fine hat-trick against Reading in the 6-1 win at St Andrew’s. Tell me more… . He has come through the same Birmingham youth system that produced Nathan Redmond, Jack Butland and Sone Aluko and was given his debut by Lee Clarke as a late sub in October 2013 aged 17 and 95 days. Demarai Gray (right) celebrates smashing a hat-trick against Reading on Saturday . He is blessed with frightening pace, an ability to dribble, and good technique, although before his recent goals he had scored only twice in 25 appearances (albeit mainly from the bench). Who has he been compared to? Redmond is the obvious example because of their Birmingham connection, but he shares a similar style and stature also to Raheem Sterling, admittedly with far to go before possibly reaching the Liverpool player’s level. What’s his story? Born in Birmingham, Gray attended Frankley High in the south of the city. His sugary touch found an adequate platform through Cadbury Athletic, a team connected to the Bournville-based chocolate factory. At 11 he was scouted by Birmingham and has been at their academy ever since. Gray (left) is attracting interest from several Premier League clubs but has been urged to stay at Birmingham . Gray (left) seals his hat-trick against Reading with a neat finish on Saturday . He describes himself as ‘bubbly, calm and happy’ and says his perfect pre-match meal is egg and toast. Ravel Morrison has been his most skillful team-mate. Talk me through this hat-trick… . It came in 34 first-half minutes. His first was a burst from central midfield to the edge of the area where he dispatched a low finish into the far corner. His second saw him race past two defenders to the right of the area and fire a shot back across goal sooner than keeper Adam Federici expected. His third was a cool finish from the left after arriving onto David Davis’s pass at full speed. Is he attracting attention from bigger clubs? Certainly, and manager Gary Rowett is braced for bids in January. Crystal Palace had a £500,000 bid rejected on transfer deadline day in the summer, an offer the club saw as vastly inferior to any they might countenance. Liverpool, Tottenham, Arsenal and Newcastle have all also been linked with monitoring his situation. Gray has 18 months left on his current deal but has been offered a two-year extension by Birmingham.","Demarai Gray scored hat-trick for Birmingham City against Reading .

"Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard has warned Liverpool counterpart Simon Mignolet it will be a 'hard road back' after the latter lost his place in the team. Reds boss Brendan Rodgers said the Belgium international was set for an indefinite period on the sidelines after leaving him out against Manchester United on Sunday. Growing criticism of Mignolet's inability to command his area and poor distribution - which some blamed for Liverpool's jittery defence - eventually took its toll and he has been replaced by Brad Jones. Simon Mignolet has lost his place in the Liverpool side following a number of high-profile mistakes . The Belgian goalkeeper has not featured in Liverpool's last two matches with Brad Jones being preferred . Everton keeper Tim Howard says it is a hard road back to the starting XI for Mignolet . Howard, no stranger to criticism himself, has some sympathy with his fellow keeper but has warned it may be difficult to come back from the blow. 'I know he is a Red but I feel for Simon. It is hard being a goalkeeper,' said the American, speaking at the launch of his autobiography 'The Keeper: A Life of Saving Goals and Achieving Them'. 'The phrase is taking the goalkeeper out of the spotlight but actually it sheds more light on them. 'It is not easy. It is a confidence position and when you take him out of the team and then bring him back do the team and fans have confidence in him?' 'You have to appreciate with a goalkeeper there are going to be ups and downs especially in this league because it is so fast and rough. Mignolet (left) takes his place on the substitutes bench during Liverpool's 3-0 defeat by Manchester United . The 26-year-old warms up before Sunday's defeat at Old Trafford . 'To be honest I think it is hard road back when you get taken out of the team. 'Sometimes there is no way back. It is unfortunate for a goalkeeper but that is the way it is: you cannot come on and play the last 20-30 minutes and put a good shift in. 'It is all or nothing with goalkeeping.' The United States international has faced criticism almost every season from some disgruntled Everton fans and, although some of it becomes personal via social media, Howard shrugs it off. 'Social media is, for me, non-existent. Anyone who pays attention to that - criticism or praise - is pretty silly,' he added. Howard was getting into the Christmas spirit as he donned a reindeer jumper last month . 'I think you have to have enough positive experiences to be able to block out the criticism. 'When I was young and at Manchester United I did not have a lot in my locker to fall back on so you make a mistake and it is doom and gloom and 'You should hang him up'. 'Now I've had enough criticism and positive experiences to know that I'm not a bad goalkeeper. 'I've had it before and it will happen again - with goalkeepers the next mistake is only just around the corner. 'If you worry about that you will crumble. I think a good goalkeeper always has to have a manager who believes in him.'","Simon Mignolet has not featured in the last two games for Liverpool .

"Dramatically, and perhaps decisively, Lewis Hamilton poked the nose of his Mercedes ahead of Nico Rosberg to win the American Grand Prix. The moment the Briton seized the race – and moved significantly closer to the world title itself – came in the 24th lap at the Circuit of Americas, his run down to the inside of left hairpin at the end of the back straight too brisk and too daring for his team-mate to withstand. Hamilton’s victory under the Texan sun was his fifth in succession and 32nd of his career – making him, in terms of grand prix wins, the most successful British driver in Formula One history, eclipsing Nigel Mansell, and in 41 fewer races. But it is not race victories that Hamilton is most avidly chasing but a second world title that would put him behind only Sir Jackie Stewart, who was watching from the paddock in his trademark tartan trews, in the pantheon of our motor racing greats.

So the mathematics says that the contest is far from over, but the psychology says it is. Rosberg has provided Hamilton a far tougher test than many imagined possible at the start of the season yet ultimately he may have to concede defeat to Hamilton’s one stupendous gift: improbable speed. Hamilton, starting second, had little chance at the start to sweep past Rosberg, who had claimed pole position so strongly. The pole side of the track here, heading into the giant first corner climb, is a bigger advantage than usual and Rosberg had got away cleanly. But, as the German admitted afterwards, he was struggling for rhythm. But he still emerged clearly ahead after the first round of pit stops. At that stage his lead was 2.5sec.

Nico was not defending and I almost caught him unawares.’ At the end he safely picked his way through the backmarkers – even with financially stricken Marussia and Caterham missing there were some – to secure his third victory in America. Daniel Ricciardo, the rising star of Red Bull, was third in another impressive drive but he never looked like overhauling either of the Mercedes with their superior engines. The race itself was balm after the fevered talk of a possible boycott by Lotus, Force India and Sauber to highlight their demands for a greater share of Formula One’s revenues. But, lo and behold, when the last strains of the Star Spangled Banner faded, and the marching band with their sousaphones and assorted brass marched off the grid, every single car took part. But it took no time for the field to be reduced. Ironically, it was two of the rebels whose cars retired. Sergio Perez had a rush of blood in front of about 10,000 fans who had made the short trip from his homeland of Mexico to cheer him on. He hit the Ferrari of Kimi Raikkonen from behind and skewed into Adrian Sutil’s Sauber. Raikkonen’s machine was no more than bruised and he continued. Perez’s car was mangled. Sutil’s was stationary. The safety car was deployed for two laps until bits of broken chassis were cleared.

As for the boycott threat, it was a farrago that could have walked straight off the pages of Evelyn Waugh’s Scoop. If a correspondent in Ishmalia reported that war had broken out, war broke out. The story begat the event, not vice versa. Here reports of a possible boycott added impetus to a fanciful notion. Nobody was ever serious about going on strike in the most important marketplace in the sport. But the conspirators loved the spotlight the speculation shone on their complaints so went along with it. There is talk of a possible resolution between the malcontents and Bernie Ecclestone and the sport’s owners CVC in the next few says. If there is none we could go through the same charade in Brazil next Sunday. Back to the sharp end of the title fight.

"Dig the bling or cringe at every flashing jewel, there is no mistaking Lewis Hamilton as the transcendent superstar of Formula One. Now, even as he edges towards his second world title, he is thinking about life and fame beyond the track’s narrow confines. Having just separated from his manager Simon Fuller — the mogul behind the Spice Girls and one-time manager to David Beckham — Hamilton has dropped his clearest hint a career in the music industry may await him. Lewis Hamilton has hinted that a music career beckons after he retires from motor racing . Hamilton overtook Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg to win the US Grand Prix . The 29-year-old raises the trophy after racing to victory in Austin, Texas . ‘A lot of drivers come back in commentary, but I have different plans and aspirations,’ he said after winning Sunday’s US Grand Prix to extend his championship lead to 24 points. ‘It’s about positioning myself so when I stop I have something to continue with. ‘There’s going to be an undeniable urge to get back in the car, because I’ve been racing since I was eight. 1. Cars - Gary Numan . 2. King of the Road - The Proclaimers . 3. Drive My Car - The Beatles . 4. Mustang Sally - Wilson Pickett . 5. (Get Your Kicks On) Route 66 - Nat King Cole . ‘At some stage, when I retire, I’ll have something that I’m also really interested in that is a substitute for racing. So that’s something I want to start working towards.’ Hamilton, 29, counts a number of rap stars as friends, sometimes bringing them to races and even putting them up in his own suite. And one of Hamilton’s inner circle told me music was ‘very much on his agenda at some point’. But while he plots his next life, he must also negotiate the future of his Formula One career. His contract at Mercedes runs out next year and his future is uncertain. But he said: ‘I don’t have any plans with that just yet. I’m quite comfortable doing it myself. ‘Nico Rosberg did his himself, Sebastian Vettel did his himself, there’s no reason I couldn’t. I hope to see a long future with this team.’ Hamilton has split with media mogul Simon Fuller (R) who includes David Beckham among his clients . Hamilton's popstar girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger is a regular visitor on the Formula One tour . The British F1 driver counts a number of hip hop artists as friends, including US rapper Nas . It may be that Hamilton can engage a Formula One expert as a consultant to help him with his contract, which will still be his bread and butter after all, and affiliate himself to a music-industry expert to set up his own record label. He also has a tight, long-standing group, including a lawyer, who often call themselves ‘Team Hamilton’, who are sure to help. 1 Lewis Hamilton         316 pts . 2 Nico Rosberg            292 pts . Points still on offer . . . Brazilian Grand Prix (Sunday) 1st 25pts, 2nd 18pts, 3rd 15pts . Abu Dhabi Grand Prix (Nov 23) 1st 50pts, 2nd 36pts, 3rd 30pts . But one thing he has ruled out is going back into a management-client relationship with his father Anthony. ‘Nope,’ he said when asked about it. ‘Me and my dad have a great relationship, he’s aware of where I am, and proud. ‘I’ve also got a great relationship with Simon. He’s a dear friend. That will always be the case.’ So is this upheaval a distraction as he looks to win the title going into the final two races of the season, in Brazil and Abu Dhabi — or ‘Abu Double’ as it has been called because points there count double? There are still 75 points available, meaning it will go down to the final race. ‘There are no issues, no distractions,’ said Hamilton. ‘If anyone wants to get in touch with me, they go through my assistant.’ Hamilton could still be pipped to the title by Rosberg with double points on offer in Abu Dhabi .

Hamilton’s victory in the US Grand Prix showed his popularity on the other side of the Atlantic — banners of support were waved from the stands as he revelled in the cheers of the American public. His momentum in the championship appears unstoppable, having won five consecutive races and 10 in all. That total places him ahead of Nigel Mansell as what the Americans would call ‘the winningest’ British driver of all time with 32 race victories. Mansell congratulated Hamilton by tweet. ‘Nigel has been very, very supportive this year,’ acknowledged Hamilton. ‘I see a lot of negative things said by legendary ex-drivers and I always think to myself, “Why would you not want to support me? We’re from the same place”. ‘When I’m gone and I come back to watch, I want to be supportive. I want to be seeing the next Brit come through and encouraging rather than kicking them in the guts.

"Russia’s tough-talking foreign minister was accused of a major error today after he claimed American members of Congress are so uninterested in the world that 80 percent of them have never traveled abroad. Sergei Lavrov’s claim was analyzed by the Washington Post's fact-checking body, and it concluded that 84 percent of lawmakers had traveled outside the U.S. on business since 2000. In contrast to the United States, more than a dozen of Russia's top politicians have been banned from making trips abroad because of sanctions brought in to punish its hardline President Vladimir Putin’s annexation of the Crimea. Russia's minister of foreign affairs, Sergei Lavrov, claimed on Wednesday that 80 percent of U.S. lawmakers had never left America, and that is why they have 'Russophobia.' A fact-checker quickly discredited the slam . The Russian official's harsh words toward U.S. legislators was precipitated by the possibility of new sanctions on the country meant to bring about economic downturn and to encourage it to cease military operations in Ukraine. Russia's top diplomat framed proposed new U.S. sanctions on his country as the work of American lawmakers with an uneducated world view. 'Congress is a very special group of people, more than 80 percent of them never left the United States, they live in their own world, so I’m not amazed about this Russophobia which is being demonstrated by the Congress at the moment,'  Lavrov told a French television channel on Wednesday. Ironically, leading American legislators wouldn't be able to visit Russia even if they wanted to as the country has put them on a blacklist in response to travel bans on its own politicians. The Russian official had fuller faith in U.S. President Barack Obama, however, and speculated that the world leader wouldn't enact new restrictions on the country. The White House on Thursday said that while Obama would sign a bill allowing for more restrictions on trade with Russia when the bill arrives on his desk this week, he does not intend to introduce new sanctions at this time. In recent days the value of the Russian rouble has  fallen sharply, as have oil prices in the country, forcing Russia's Central Bank into panic mode. In the wee hours of Tuesday morning it suddenly announced an interest rate increase as a last-ditch effort to stabilize the country's currency. Earlier this week, the spokesman for 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Josh Earnest, told reporters, 'The fact of the matter is [Russian President] Vladimir Putin actually is the person in the world with the most consequential role to play in trying to reverse this trend. 'If merely he will live up to the kinds of commitments that he’s already made...you could see the international community start to relax these sanctions in a way that would relieve the pressure on the people of Russia and on the Russian economy,' he said. 'And that would be good for the world,' he added. ''It would send a very clear signal that respecting these basic international norms is important, and it would also allow President Putin to demonstrate to his people that he’s actually concerned about their well being and the well being of their economy.' U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, right, and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, left, share a laugh during their meeting, at Villa Taverna, on Sunday in Rome. Kerry and Lavrov discussed the ongoing Middle East peace process, and rising tensions in Ukraine. The White House said today that it would not put additional sanctions on Russia at this time but it would sign legislation giving it the option to in the future . Lavrov denied to France 24 in an interview on Wednesday that the sanctions already in place on his country are causing an 'economic meltdown.' 'Of course it hurts, we don’t take any pleasure from sanctions,' he said, according to a translation of his remarks posted to his ministry's website. 'But it’s not our problem. It’s the problem of the European Union and the United States and other countries,' he claimed. Lavrov pointed the finger of blame at the U.S. for convincing its allies to punish Russia and denigrated European countries as cowardly for playing follow the leader. 'Frankly, it’s really a pity that we for some previous years overestimated the independence of the European Union and even big European countries.' he said. Continuing, he said 'some people believe that sanctions are a sign of weakness or a sign of irritation, which is not the best quality of a politician, but I can assure you that Russia will not only survive, but will come out stronger out of this. 'We have been in much worse situations in our history, and every time we were getting out of these fixes much stronger. This will happen this time,' he asserted. Turning his ire to U.S. lawmakers, Lavrov insulted their intelligence and suggested that Obama wouldn't place new sanctions on Russia, even if he did sign legislation giving him the authority to do so. 'The bill is not automatic. It provides for some specific things, I believe, to be done automatically, but it also provides for something to be left to the president’s discretion,' he said. 'So we’ll see how it works,' he said while declining whether to say whether Russia would consider additional restrictions an act of war.","'More than 80 percent of them never left the United States, they live in their own world, so I’m not amazed about this Russophobia,' he said .

Derby County are ready to launch an ambitious bid to sign Ross McCormack from Championship rivals Fulham. The Scotland forward joined Fulham from Leeds for £11million in July but their poor start under Felix Magath has left them 10 points adrift of the promotion contenders.

"The U.S.-led coalition in the Middle East launched 11 air strikes against Islamic State targets today, hitting six targets in Syria and five in Iraq. The raids in Syria focused on the contested city of Kobani near the Turkish border, destroying seven Islamic State fighting positions, a building and a tactical unit, the U.S. military said. In Iraq the raids targeted Islamic State militants in the key cities of Tal Afar, Mosul and Ramadi, Reuters quoted officials as saying. The U.S.-led coalition in the Middle East launched 11 air strikes against Islamic State targets today, hitting six targets in Syria and five in Iraq (file photo) Today  U.S. officials said U.S.-led air strikes against Islamic State in Iraq have killed three of the militant group's top leaders but not senior commander Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Among those killed was Abd al Basit, whom the officials described as the group's military 'emir,' and Haji Mutazz, a deputy to Baghdadi. Those strikes took place between Dec. 3 and Dec. 9, they said. Today U.S. officials U.S.-led air strikes against Islamic State in Iraq have killed three of the militant group's top leaders but not senior commander Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured) They also confirmed last month's killing of Radwan Taleb al-Hamdouni, whom local medical sources had described to Reuters at the time as the radical militant group's leader in the northern city of Mosul. News of the killings, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, came the same day the top U.S. commander of coalition efforts against the Islamic State, Lieutenant General James Terry, hailed the impact of four months of air strikes in Iraq. 'We've made significant progress in halting that (militant) offensive,' Terry told reporters. He pointed to successful air strikes this week around Iraq's Sinjar Mountain and Zumar. Those strikes helped Kurdish peshmerga fighters fight their way to Sinjar mountain and, according to a Kurdish leader, free hundreds of people trapped there by Islamic State fighters. Army Lt. Gen. James Terry, commander of the Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve, takes questions during a briefing at the Pentagon on Thursday . At the same time, Terry outlined a long fight ahead, cautioning it would take several years to build necessary capabilities of Iraqi forces, who crumbled during the Islamic State's offensive this summer. Terry said the next wave of American troops will begin moving into Iraq in a couple of weeks to train local forces. He said the challenge is to get Iraqi units trained and back into the fight so they can plan operations to regain contested areas such as Mosul. He said that while there has been progress in halting the militants' charge across Iraq, 'I think what we must do, especially inside of Iraq, is continue to build those (Iraqi) capabilities. I think you're at least talking a minimum of three years.' The Iraqi army wants to launch a counteroffensive to retake Mosul, the largest city in northern Iraq, and the U.S. likely would help. While there have been some concerns that Iraq's military may not be ready yet for such an ambitious operation, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said last week that the U.S. is working with senior Iraqi leaders on preparations. 'Part of the planning has to be how you generate force to do operations,' Terry told reporters during a briefing in the Pentagon. The question, he said, is 'how do you get into a place where you can generate some capability, pull some units back so that you can make them better, and then now start to put those against operations down the road.' He declined to reveal when a Mosul operation might be launched. There have been fewer details and more limited media access to U.S. military operations in Iraq this time than during the eight years of war that ended in 2011. U.S. officials say it's because the military is there only to advise and assist the sovereign Iraqi government. There are currently about 1,700 U.S. troops in Iraq, and President Barack Obama has authorized up to 3,000. More than 1,000 U.S. troops are expected to be deployed in the coming weeks to increase the effort to advise and assist Iraq units at the higher headquarters levels and also to conduct training at several sites around the country. Terry also offered an optimistic view of the Shiite-dominated Iraqi government's progress in working more with the Sunni tribes. President Barack Obama said one of the main reasons for authorising air strikes was to prevent an impending massacre of the ethnic minority Yazidis (pictured) The US has bombed areas in Sinjar ahead of a Kurdish peshmerga attempt to liberate the city. If recaptured, it would open up a corridor to Sinjar mountain (pictured), where hundreds of Yazidis remain besieged . The deep sectarian divide fueled the advances of the Islamic State militants across Iraq earlier this year as grievances led some align with the extremists. U.S. officials have stressed that ongoing coalition assistance hinges in part on whether the Iraqi government becomes more inclusive. The U.S. and Iraqi governments have proposed creating a national guard program that would arm and pay tribesmen to fight. Terry said Thursday that as the Iraqis conduct more combat operations in Sunni strongholds such as Anbar, there will be more opportunities to bring tribal members into the fight. He said the national guard effort is starting and that he is optimistic the Iraqi government will approve legislation needed for the program to move forward. Also today, a senior Kurdish official in Iraq said the peshmerga fighters battling Islamic State militants have managed to open up a corridor to Sinjar Mountain so that thousands from the Yazidi minority trapped there can flee. US military experts arrived at Ein al-Asad airbase (pictured) last month to help train and support Iraqi forces . Masrur Barzani says the Kurdish forces established the passageway Thursday, a day after launching the operation to retake the IS-held Sinjar, The Associated Press reported. Tens of thousands of Yazidis became trapped in the mountain in early August, when the IS extremists captured the towns of Sinjar and Zumar, prompting the exodus. Many were eventually airlifted off the mountain or escorted by a passageway through Syria back into Iraq, to find refuge in the Iraqi Kurdish semi-autonomous region in northern Iraq, but thousands more came later and remained stuck on the mountain. 'Our hope is that all those people will eventually be able to go back to their own homes and villages and towns but those that are in need of evacuation now, a corridor has been opened to evacuate those people,' Mr Barzani told The Associated Press in Irbil, the Kurdish regional capital . Yazidis follow an ancient religion with ties to Zoroastrianism. The Kurdish forces, known also as peshmerga, said in September that they would focus on Sinjar after liberating the nearby towns of Rabia, Mahmoudiya and Zumar.","Coalition war planes also hit five targets in IS-held territory in Iraq .

Nadal, 28, has signed up as the fashion label's global brand ambassador in 2015 and will also appear in campaigns for its Tailored collection. Scroll down for video . First look at Rafael Nadal as the new 2015 global ambassador for Tommy Hilfiger's Tailored collection . Nadal holds the record for his nine French Open victories but is also famous for his impressive physique . The designer chose Nadal because he's 'confident, fun and cool'. Nadal  said: 'I've always admired Tommy Hilfiger's cool, all-American designs which are sophisticated and easy to wear, and I'm excited to be partnering with the brand.' Yet this isn't the first time he's stripped off for fashion - Rafa showcased his chiseled physique as the face and body of Armani's underwear campaign in 2011. He joined a growing club of sporting heroes posing in boxers and briefs in the name of fashion like David Beckham and Cristian Ronaldo. Nadal's great on-court rival Roger Federer has yet to strip off for a fashion campaign, instead starring in ads for Rolex and Moet & Chandon. And if the black and white teaser picture for the campaign proves anything it's that Rafa's legions of female fans are in for a treat. One of tennis's greats, Rafael Nadal is the second male player in the world to have completed the Career Golden Slam, winning the French, Australian and U.S. Opens, Wimbledon and an Olympic gold medal . He oozes cool as he gazes nonchalantly into the camera wearing a light grey suit, darker open-necked shirt, his hair swept back from his face. The full campaign imagery will be photographed in early 2015 in Nadal's home country of Spain. Tommy Hilfiger describes the new underwear range as featuring 'updated fits, revamped fabrics and elevated details' while the Autumn 2015 Tommy Hilfiger Tailored collection features 'sharp silhouettes, modern tailoring and rich textures'. Nadal smouldered as the face - and chest - of Armani Jeans in the moody, black and white 2011 ad campaign . The designer said: 'Rafael Nadal has been a longtime personal friend and supporter of our brand, and I'm continuously inspired by his dedication and passion for his sport. 'This exclusive partnership brings one of the greatest athletes of this generation into our Tommy family. 'Rafael embodies an effortless sense of style that exemplifies and reflects our brand spirit – he's confident, fun and cool.'","Tennis ace named as Tommy Hilfiger global ambassador for 2015 .

"Scientists have identified what they believe is the key to wrinkle free skin, raising hopes for creams and treatments that could defy aging. In a 20-week tanning experiment, they found that mice who lacked the enzyme Granzyme-B had aged significantly less than than those who had it. The researchers found that they also had noticeably smoother skin and their collagen was more intact. The secret to wrinkle-free skin may lie in blocking an enzyme called Granzyme B, scientists believe . Incredibly the discovery was made by accident as the researchers were looking into the role of Granzyme-B in atherosclerosis and heart attacks. During their experiments they happened to notice the difference in the quality of the skin on the different groups of mice. Lead researcher David Granville of the University of British Columbia said: ‘This is one of those moments that we live for in science. ‘We were interested in the effects of aging on blood vessels; we had no idea (the absence of this enzyme) would have any effect on their skin.’ Professor Granville added that his team was developing drugs that can block Granzyme B - and hoped to make them commercially available soon. He said: ‘We have generated natural and synthetic inhibitors of this enzyme and one can easily see the application for this after excessive sun exposure...or in other cosmetics as well. ‘That’s obviously the first thing that comes to mind’. The research team created a miniature tanning salon for the mice in the experiment and each mouse was put on a carousel that turned under UV lamps. The animals were exposed to the light three times a week for three to four minutes each session, which was enough to make them red but not to burn. By week 20, it was clear that the mice who had been engineered to lack Granzyme B had pristine skin - but the control group had wrinkles. Professor Granville said: ‘About 80 to 90 per cent of visible skin aging is caused by sunlight. ‘We found that by knocking out (Granzyme B) we could markedly protect against the loss of collagen and it prevented wrinkling in these mice.’ Scientists hope creams and treatments that could defy aging may come from the discovery . Granzyme B appears to work by interfering with the the integrity of collagen and dismantling the ‘cellular scaffolding’ that binds its cells together. This results in structural weakness which we see on the surface as wrinkles. Exposure to sunlight appears to increase the level of Granzyme B, thus accelerating its harmful effect on the skin. Professor Granville said that many anti-aging cosmetics include collagen which consumers apply to the skin even though it does very little. He said: ‘By adding collagen without putting out the fire, you are just adding wood to the fire. ‘This offers an actual realistic solution, where you can inhibit the enzyme that is leading to the breakdown of collagen.’ Professor Granville’s Canadian company, viDa Therapeutics, is currently working on a lotion that will stop sores and burns caused by too much sun. And whilst the experiment worked in mice who were bred to have no Granzyme B at all, in humans things are more complicated as the enzyme it is part of the immune system and removing it may have unintended consequences.","Mice who lacked the enzyme Granzyme-B aged significantly less .

"Six months after the original Pig Dog sent social media sites into meltdown - another deformed canine is beginning to make waves on the web. Cuda the Pitbull, who has shortened spine syndrome, has amassed a huge Facebook following after pictures of the ugly but strangely cute animal began to circulate on Facebook. The condition is so rare vets have no idea of its long term effects - but Cuda's owner Julie LeRoy insists the pooch leads a normal and active life at their home in Ulster County, New York. Scroll down for video . Internet star: Cuda the Pitbull, who suffers from rare shortened spine syndrome, has achieved online fame . In June, pictures of Pig the dog brought the bizarre and unfortunate affliction to people's attention. Now Cuda's Facebook page, created for her entry into the World's Ugliest Dog competition, has proved a huge hit - amassing more than 16,000 followers. Ms Leroy, 48, said: 'Cuda came to me when I was working as an animal control officer in North Carolina. 'While out on a call, which turned out to be more of a neighbour dispute, a complainant brought her out on a twine leash and told me they needed to give her away because they were moving. 'She looked just like she does now, only half the size. Cuda's owner Julie LeRoy (pictured) claims the rare condition does not affect the dog's everyday life . 'I took a photo and texted my husband. I told him I couldn't take her back to the shelter as they would take one look at her and euthanize her. 'He said no, but I won the argument and Cuda came home. 'I later found out these people bought her from craigslist for $50 from a backyard breeder located two hours away. Cuda's condition became known to the world when pictures emerged of Pig the Dog back in June . 'They only had Cuda a couple of weeks.' Cuda, named by her previous owners because she looks like a barracuda due to her under bite, came home with Ms LeRoy in 2010. While she admits to getting some strange reactions to her deformed dog while out and about, she claims most people are very accepting. She said: 'We can't get more than a few steps wherever we are. 'Everyone wants to know what kind of dog she is and what is 'wrong' with her. Cuda's Facebook page was launched when she was entered into the World's Ugliest Dog competition in 2010 . 'Some people feel sorry for her because of her looks but I tell them not to. Most people are delighted with her. That's why I took her to be certified for therapy. She makes people happy. 'I have many of her fans tell me they have her picture on their computer desktop because it makes them smile.' Ms LeRoy added: 'We entered her in the World's Ugliest Dog competition because we wanted to create awareness about irresponsible breeding pit bull discrimination. Cuda was given her name by her previous owners for resembling a barracuda due to her under bite . Unsuccessful: Cuda entered the World's Ugliest Dog competition in 2010 but failed to bring home the crown . 'We launched her new page in 2011 as an educational forum for breed specific legislation as well as backyard breeder awareness. 'Now she has over 16,000 likes. I love every one of those people on her page.' Although vets do not know what the future holds for Cuda due to the rarity of her condition, Ms LeRoy has taken comfort in finding other dogs online with the same condition. She said: 'We've had a few wonderful vets in our life, but none of them have ever dealt with a dog like Cuda. The original Pig Dog: Found in woods near Atlanta, Pig was born with severe deformities, but was adopted and nursed by a woman in Alabama, and has gone on to win the hearts people's all over the world . 'Meeting parents of other short spine dogs on Facebook has been so helpful because many of these dogs are already seniors. 'We are facing a challenge that no other short spine dog has as Cuda also suffers from diabetes. 'It is not something that we feel was caused by her short spine syndrome, it's just a challenge that we face that is very scary to any parent of a diabetic dog or cat. 'She does live a normal life in every other way. She plays and runs so fast. She is not physically inhibited at all.'","Deformed dog Cuda was taken in by animal control officer Julie LeRoy .

"The asteroid that wiped out dinosaurs 66 million years ago also killed off many mammals, according to new research. Although the extinction of the dinosaurs is thought to have paved the way for 'placental mammals' such as humans, to dominate, the study shows that many other mammals died off alongside them. This puts a twist on the 'classic story' that it was just the demise of the dinosaurs the allowed us to thrive - and instead suggests a mass extinction of mammals also played a part, too. A study led by New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science said two-thirds of our mammalian rivals went extinct with the dinosaurs (asteroid impact illustrated). So-called metatherian mammals thrived in the shadow of the dinosaurs. But many of them were wiped out by the asteroid impact . The study was led by an international team of experts on mammal evolution and mass extinctions, and was published in the journal ZooKeys. Metatherian mammals - the extinct relatives of living marsupials such as kangaroos - thrived in the shadow of the dinosaurs during the Cretaceous period. But, the study shows that these once widespread mammals nearly followed the dinosaurs into oblivion. Scientists have long believed that heavy dust from the asteroid impact blocked out the sun, setting off a disastrous chain of events that led to the extinction of the dinosaurs. But now researchers in the US have found evidence for a theory that major volcanic eruption began just before the impact, possibly also playing a role in the extinction. Based on their analysis, the researchers determined that the eruption began 250,000 years before the asteroid strike and continued for 500,000 years after the giant impact. Scientists at MIT and Princeton University calculated that the volcano spewed out a total of 932,000 square miles (2.4 million square kilometres) of lava. The immense volcanism may have released dangerous levels of volatile chemicals into the air, poisoning the atmosphere and oceans, they say. When a 6.2-mile (10km) wide asteroid struck what is now Mexico at the end of the Cretaceous period and unleashed a global cataclysm of environmental destruction, some two-thirds of all metatherians living in North America perished, according to the study. This includes more than 90 per cent of species living in the northern Great Plains of the US, the best area in the world for preserving the latest Cretaceous mammal fossils. In the aftermath of the mass extinction, metatherians would never recover their previous diversity, which is why marsupial mammals are rare today and largely restricted to unusual environments in Australia and South America. Taking advantage of the metatherian demise were the placental mammals: species that give live birth to well-developed young. They are ubiquitous around the globe today, and include everything from mice to men. The latest findings were made when the scientists made a more detailed evolutionary tree of mammals before and after the asteroid impact - and found many metatherians went extinct alongside the dinosaurs. This image shows a cast of the fossil remnants of Asiatherium reshetovi, one of the metatherian species that used to live on the planet millions of years ago. Their mass extinction ultimately allowed placental mammals, from mice to man, to dominate planet Earth . Dr Steve Brusatte, of Edinburgh University's School of GeoSciences, said: 'The classic tale is that dinosaurs died out and mammals, which had been waiting in the wings for over 100 million years, then finally had their chance. But our study shows that many mammals came perilously close to extinction' (T-Rex shown) Study lead author Dr Thomas Williamson, of the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science, told MailOnline: 'This is a new twist on a classic story. 'It wasn't only that dinosaurs died out, providing an opportunity for mammals to reign, but that many types of mammals, such as most metatherians, died out too - this allowed advanced placental mammals to rise to dominance.' Dr Steve Brusatte, of Edinburgh University's School of GeoSciences, added: 'The classic tale is that dinosaurs died out and mammals, which had been waiting in the wings for over 100 million years, then finally had their chance. 'But our study shows that many mammals came perilously close to extinction. 'If a few lucky species didn't make it through, then mammals may have gone the way of the dinosaurs and we wouldn't be here.'","Study led by New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science says two-thirds of our mammalian rivals went extinct with the dinosaurs .

"Scientists have made sense of why some of us have no sense of direction. They’ve pinpointed signals in the human brain that determine how good we are at navigating. This inbuilt compass tells us which way were are facing and works out which way to turn to go where we want. And in those with a poor sense of direction, the signals are fuzzier. Scroll down for video . The results, by a team at the University College London, suggest that we have networks of brain cells dedicated to specific compass points, such as north and south. The cells that sense north - for example, light up when we face north – and also spring to life when we think about turning to the north . The researchers, from University College London, scanned the brains of 16 men and women as they played a computer game that tested their ability to navigate. The results suggest that we have networks of brain cells dedicated to specific compass points, such as north and south. The cells that sense north light up when we face north – and also spring to life when we think about turning to the north. If we are facing north but planning to walk east, two sets of cells are involved. All of the cells are found in a part of the brain called the entorhinal region. Researcher Dr Hugo Spiers said: ‘In this simple test, we were looking to see which areas of the brain were active when participants were considering different directions. ‘We were surprised to see that the strength and consistency of brain signals from the entorhinal region noticeably influenced people’s performance in such a basic task. Studies suggest that a cab driver's brain may change to accommodate an internal 'map' of their city . Cabbies who have memorised London's 25,000 streets and landmarks have a larger volume of 'grey matter'. But this change only occurs in those who successfully pass the exams. Studies suggest that the brain may change to accommodate an internal 'map' of London. Only around half of trainees finally make the grade as London taxi drivers by passing the Knowledge test. Scientists followed a group of 79 trainee drivers and a 'control group' of 31 non-taxi drivers. MRI scans were used to take brain structure 'snapshots' of the volunteers, who were also given certain memory tasks. At the start of the study, there were no obvious differences between participants' brains. Three to four years later, significant differences were seen. The 39 trainees who qualified had greater volumes of grey matter in their posterior hippocampus than the 40 who failed, or the non-taxi drivers. ‘This type of “homing signal” has been thought to exist for many years, but until now it has remained purely speculation.’ Dr Martin Chadwick, lead author of the study, said: ‘Our results provide evidence to support the idea that your internal “compass” readjusts as you move through the environment. ‘If you get lost after taking too many turns, this may be because your brain could not keep up and failed to adjust your facing and goal directions.’ With just 16 people taking part in the study, the researchers weren’t able to tell if there is a difference between the sexes’ ability to navigate. If we are facing north but planning to walk east, two sets of cells are involved. All of the cells are found in a part of the brain called the entorhinal region (red) Dr Spiers said: ‘My guess is that there probably isn’t. ‘Some studies have shown that women have a better visual memory – you can show them a scene and they will remember it better than men. ‘Men, in contrast, can work with the geometry and rotate things in their mind better. ‘But when you bring it all together, the difference disappears.’ The research, published in the journal Current Biology, could lead to ways of training the brain to improve sense of direction. It could also help shed light in dementia. The entorhinal region is one of the first parts of the brain affected by Alzheimer’s disease, so the findings may also help to explain why people start to get lost in the early stages of the disease. It is hoped that a version of the navigation test used in study could be used detect Alzheimer’s early and monitor its progress. This year’s Nobel Prize for Medicine was awarded to another UCL researcher for work on our inner ‘sat nav’. Dr John Isaac, of Wellcome Trust which funded the latest research, said: ‘Neuroscientists have made huge advances in our understanding of how we navigate space, widely recognised after this year’s Nobel prizes, and this research is yet another step forward. ‘Why some people are better navigators than others is intrinsically interesting, but it also helps us explain the processes that go wrong in people with degenerative brain disorders such as dementia. ‘An estimated 850,000 people are living with dementia in the UK, many of whom suffer deterioration in their navigational skills, leaving them lost and confused.’","Scientists were able to predict navigational skills based on a brain scan .

"The oddball political marriage of Richard Nixon's grandson to a much-younger billionaire grocery heiress is ending after three years. Andrea Catsimatidis filed for divorce on Wednesday from Christopher Nixon Cox in Manhattan family court. It's unknown what caused the break up, which began with a lavish 2011 ceremony at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in Manhattan. Some of New York's biggest political names - including Hillary Clinton and Henry Kissinger - were in attendance. Scroll down for video . Trouble in paradise: Andrea Catsimatidis. 24. Christopher Nixon Cox, 36, were pictured together on a European vacation in July. She filed for divorce on Wednesday . Catsimatidis caused a stir this week when she posed for this photo with her mother and former President Bill Clinton. Hillary attended Catsimatidis' wedding . Their lavish 2011 marriage at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel included many of New York's biggest political heavy hitters . The divorce is uncontested so the case is likely to be resolved quickly. There is no word on what sort of financial settlement is involved, according to the New York Post. Catsimatidis is the daughter of John Catsimatidis, the owner of the Gristedes grocery chain and a former New York City Republican mayoral candidate. His fortunate is estimated at $3.1billion. Nixon Cox is the only son of Richard Nixon's daughter Tricia Nixon and Edward Cox, the longtime New York Republican State Committee. Nixon Cox met Catsimatidis at her exclusive all-girls New York high school when he was campaigning for John McCain in 2008. She was just 17 at the time. Taking china by storm: The couple toured Beijing last year to retrace the steps of Cox Nixon's grandfather during his famous 1972 visit to China . The divorce is not contested, meaning it will likely be resolved quickly and with minimal public drama . Catsimatidis, seen here with her father John in 2003, was just 17 when she met her future ex-husband when he made a campaign stop at her high school in 2008 . Nixon Cox is 11 years older than Catsimatidis, now 24. After their courtship, Catsimatidis became the talk of the Long Island social scene when she starting showing up to Nixon Cox's staid political gatherings wearing skin-tight skirts and bosom-bearing tops. Last year, the couple traveled to Beijing to retrace Richard Nixon's seminal 1972 trip to China. The couple have not commented on the split or what may have caused it. They were we last pictured on a romantic European vacation together in July shortly after Catsimatidis celebrated her 24th birthday. She caused a stir this week when she posed in a very low-cut dress with former President Bill Clinton. The picture turned into a viral meme that defended Bill Cosby from rape allegations and accused Clinton of harassing women. His parents are Tricia Nixon, daughter of Richard Nixon, and Edward Cox, a longtime New York state Republican party chairman .","Andrea Catsimatidis filed for divorce from Christopher Nixon Cox .

"Wisdom, the world’s oldest known wild bird, is preparing to be a mother again after laying an egg at the ripe age of 63. The Laysan albatross also had an egg hatch in February, meaning the latest arrival will be her 36th chick, according to estimates. Wisdom laid the egg at a nesting site at the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge in the North Pacific, about 1,200 miles (1,930 km) northwest of Honolulu, Hawaii. Wisdom the Laysan albatross laid the egg at a nesting site 1,200 miles (1,930km) northwest of Hawaii. Experts estimate that this was her 36th egg in three decades. However, while the species is monogamous, it's not known for certain she has kept the same partner all these years. Wisdom is pictured with her latest egg . Laysan albatrosses are monogamous, meaning they mate for life with just one partner, making it all the more remarkable that she has consistently been laying eggs over the past three decades. She is said to have had the same partner throughout her life, although experts can't know for certain without running tests on the offspring. ‘We are thrilled with the public's interest in Wisdom. 'She really captures people’s imagination around the world, particularly kids', and has become a great ambassador for conservation and Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge,' said  deputy refuge manager Bret Wolfe. Five trillion pieces of plastic litter are floating in the world’s oceans, which is killing countless animals a year, including albatross chicks. It is thought that 269,000 tons of plastic are clogging up the oceans - weighing the equivalent of two large cruise liners. Scientists reported finding billions of plastic shopping bags, bottles, toys, action figures, toothbrushes, fishing gear and even toilet seats floating in the waves. Plastic pollution kills huge numbers of seabirds, marine mammals and other creatures, while discarded fishing nets trap dolphins, sea turtles and manta rays. Fragments also lodge in the throats and digestive tracts of animals, attracted by the bright colours of the plastics and mistake them for fish. One horrific picture of an albatross chick, dead on a beach in the north Pacific, reveals the scale of the global problem. Wisdom was officially tagged by scientists in 1956 when she was an estimated five years old, and has since recorded more than three million miles (4.8 million km) flying around the coast of Hawaii and beyond. Experts at the US Fish and Wildlife Service claim Wisdom is the oldest bird they know of in the organisation’s 90-year history and has consistently laid eggs over the past three decades. ‘As the world’s oldest known bird in the wild, Wisdom is an iconic symbol of inspiration and hope for all seabird species,' said fellow refuge manager Dan Clark. ‘She provides to the world valuable information about the longevity of these beautiful creatures. ‘In the case of Wisdom, she has logged literally millions of miles over the Pacific Ocean in her lifetime to find enough fish eggs and squid to feed herself and multiple chicks, allowing us the opportunity to measure the health of our oceans which sustain albatross as well as ourselves.’ Laysan albatrosses breed on the Hawaiian islands of Oahu, at Kaena Point, and on Kauai, at Kilauea Point. The typical lifespan of a Laysan albatross is 12 to 40 years according to wildlife officials. Their feeding grounds are off the west coast of North America, including the Gulf of Alaska, and they spend their first three to five years constantly flying, never touching land. Scientists believe they even sleep while flying over the ocean. Wisdom laid the egg at a nesting site at the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge (shown) in the North Pacific, about 1,200 miles (1,930 km) northwest of Honolulu, Hawaii . Wisdom is a 63-year-old Laysan albatross believed to be the oldest wild bird in the world. Here she is pictured with a chick between her legs back in February, which also hatched at the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge near Hawaii . Albatrosses lay only one egg a year, but it takes much of that year to incubate and raise the chick. After several consecutive years in which they have successfully raised and fledged a chick, the parents may take the occasional year off from parenting. The 590-acre Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, a small US territory that lies nestled in the North Pacific between Honolulu and Tokyo, is home to 70 per cent of the World’s Laysan albatross population. Wisdom has led a long life and even has a children’s book named after her, which documents how she survived the Japanese Tsunami of 2011 which put her nest in the path of danger.","Wisdom the Laysan albatross laid the egg at a nesting site 1,200 miles northwest of Hawaii .

On Friday, The Sun reported that Mel is lying low in London and has changed her phone number. Her husband is said be concerned the furore could 'severely damage' his reputation. But Belafonte - who has a string of previous convictions, including assault - spoke exclusively to MailOnline on Wednesday, addressing allegations he beat his wife. 'No one has accused me of anything,' he said, adding that this is 'not the first time' he's been branded a violent thug. When asked about the speculation of domestic abuse, Belafonte said: 'Who accused me of it, did she accuse me of it, the police, the hospital, who accused me of it? I thought when you beat someone up the police or the hospital or the person you beat up says it.' He predicted to MailOnline that the media storm currently surrounding him would be ‘gone in a second’. He added: 'I mean come on, how long will it take, two weeks a month, two months, a year. It's totally around me, it's not big news, it's not all over the newspapers here (in the US)… it's not a big massive story.' Belafonte, who is believed to be staying in the couple's Los Angeles home, was asked by MailOnline whether his wife had left him, following the reports that she had walked out on their relationship. 'I already said that on my Twitter,' he said, although MailOnline could not find any references to his marriage by Belafonte or his reps on the social networking site. The Sun reported earlier this week that Mel B had packed up and left the couple's London home after their furious arguing became too much to bear. On Monday morning a furious Belafonte hit back, saying: 'I don't usually respond to Twitter msgs but I will respond to comments of hitting my wife which I think are quite disgusting un true! 'Mel was very ill a bunch of doctors helped her get better if fans can't just relax B4 being negative they r not real fans of @OfficialMelB.'

In 2007, shortly after his marriage to Mel B in June that year, it emerged that Belafonte had been charged with battery in America after being arrested for attacking his then girlfriend, Nicole Contreras. He pleaded 'no contest' to the battery charge – which the judge stated was the same as a guilty plea – and was ordered to take part in a Domestic Violence Batterers' Programme.

"Toymaking giant Playmobil has been accused by concerned parents and children's charities of 'glorifying crime' for selling children's playsets depicting a bank robbery and a 'fatal' bike crash. But German company Playmobil has dismissed the claims and said their graphic children's toys are acceptable because children need to be taught about 'baddies' Toys R Us, Argos and Amazon have all stocked the controversial Playmobil sets, which are part of Playmobil's 'City Action' series, in the run up to Christmas. Toymaking giant Playmobil has been accused by parents and children's charities of 'glorifying crime' for selling children's games as part of its 'City Action' series- including this one which depicts a bank robbery . One of the plastic sets, called the Bank and Raid, shows a female bank robber holding a gun while sticking up a terrified bank worker who is handing over wads of cash. The set, on sale for £39.99, has created a storm of controversy among justice campaigners and parent groups, for 'glorifying' crime. The toy is aimed at children aged four to ten and features a blonde woman disguised behind a pair of large black sunglasses sticking up a cashier, and comes complete with gold bullion and bank notes. The other set, thought to be new for this Christmas, depicts an injured cyclist getting stretchered into the back of an ambulance after suffering a crash - and comes with extra bandages. The other controversial set depicts an cyclist getting stretchered into the back of an ambulance after a crash . Playmobil has caused controversy before, manufacturing construction worker play sets which come complete with shovels, tools and three crates of what appears to be beer. Concerned dad Trevor Johnson, 43, spotted both the sets for sale at the Tunbridge Wells branch of Toys R Us, in Kent. He said: 'It's depressing because it says to kids 'this is what life is like'. 'A gun for a four-year-old is quite shocking. I think there is a difference between boys playing with soldiers and someone actually staging a bank robbery - and it's not like it's a tacky brand. 'There is something a bit nasty about depicting a crime and it could then make it scary for kids going in to banks. 'It's also a bit grim people being run over. 'You do have a woman bank robber so it is half politically correct.' A Kent mother, who asked not to be named, said: 'My daughter is five, and she's just learning to ride her bike. 'The last thing I want her playing with is a toy that shows a dead cyclist which has been run over. 'It's horrific. Toys should be about fun, not grim reality.' Concerned parents described the toys as 'horrific' and say the toys send out the wrong message to children . Toy retailer the Early Learning Centre carry the Playmobil City Action line in their stores, but do not stock the two controversial sets on their website. Smyths do not have the sets listed on their website either. Danny Bryan of Communities Against Gun and Knife Crime, which works to help youngsters avoid lives of violence, said: 'We don't want to be encouraging young people to look at these sorts of things. 'I think it is horrendous that young people are given all these images to shape them. It is sending out the wrong message.' Jamie Dickinson, Playmobil marketing manager, said: 'We have been producing police and emergency services play sets for over 35 years. 'One thing our customer feedback tells us is that it is important that children can be taught, through play, the importance of recognising good from evil and 'baddies' from 'goodies', as well as understanding scenes from real life, such as accidents and emergencies. 'We fully support creating a safe environment for all children and would hope that in their own small way our sets deliver this in a secure, but believable, way.' Toys R Us have refused to comment. German company Playmobil said their toys are acceptable as children need to be taught about 'baddies'","Parents and action groups say the two controversial sets 'glorify crime'

"A worrying study has revealed that annual total of gun deaths in the United States is catching up with the number who are killed in car crashes. The report published in the Annual Review of Public Health compares a number of figures, including traffic deaths as well as suicides and homicides involving a firearm. The total of those killed in a vehicle is still higher than those who die by a gun shot, but the gap between the figures is narrowing substantially and in 13 states it has already been overtaken. In California, Arizona, Montana, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Virginia and Colorado, the number of deaths by guns is higher than those killed by a car. Scroll down for video . A graph published in the Annual Review of Public Health reveals that gun deaths in the United States are getting gradually closer to those killed in car crashes . States on the west coast generally had a larger number of deaths resulting from gun violence or suicide than the total killed while in a vehicle . The study also highlights that there are far more firearm suicides than homicides . However in Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Nevada and Utah, gun suicides alone exceed the total in traffic deaths. According to the study titled The Epidemiology of Firearm Violence in the Twenty-First Century United States, these deaths cost the economy approximately $164.6 billion in 2010, around 1.1 per cent of the US GDP for that year. The suicide rate in Montana was 8.5 times that in New Jersey while the homicide rate in Louisiana was 9.5 times that in New Hampshire. However states with high rates of firearm homicide did not necessarily have had high rates of firearm suicide. Instead, states with both the highest and lowest rates of firearm suicide were among those with low rates of firearm homicide. Low-suicide, low-homicide states tended to be in New England whereas high-suicide, low-homicide states tended to lie in the rural Northwest. This graph highlights the correlation between suicides and homicides for every state. For example The suicide rate in Montana was 8.5 times that in New Jersey while the homicide rate in Louisiana was 9.5 times that in New Hampshire . States with both high-suicide and high-homicide rates were generally in the Southeast. Firearms were used in 69.6 per cent of all homicides that year (74.2 per cent among men and 52.4 per cent among women) and 50.9 per cent of all suicides (56.4 per cent among men and 31.2 per cent among women, for whom firearms ranked second after poisoning). The findings are also broken down into demographics, highlighting a wide variation of those involved. For example suicides are the cause of far more deaths than homicides. The figures peak for victims in their mid-twenties and gradually increase with age. Homicides on the other hand are more likely to kill people in their late teens and early twenties with the numbers going down with age. These figures show that gun-related homicides are more likely to involve people in their late teens and early twenties while decreasing with age, whereas firearm suicides increase gradually from a high point of people in their mid-twenties . Black males were revealed as the demographic most likely to be involved in a firearm-related homicide . The trend was the same when it came to women. However the scale is much smaller with just over seven deaths per 100,000 due to gun homicide whereas in men it is around 90 for every 100,000 . Young black men are the demographic with the highest rate of gun-related homicides while older white males have the highest rate when it comes to killing themselves with a gun. There is a similar trend for women. Firearm homicide death rates peak among black men and women ages 20 to 24.However there is a vast difference in the scale. Among black males that age, the rate is nearly 90 deaths per 100,000 people, while for black females, the rate is closer to seven deaths per 100,000. The author Garen J. Wintemute concludes that, despite the shocking figures, the trend of gun deaths has remained stable for the past decade. Homicides are decreasing but suicides are on the up. In 2012, 64 per cent . The summary reads: 'Further research on the nature and prevention of firearm violence is sorely needed. Fortunately President Obama has directed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to resume its work in the field. 'Evidence-based interventions may lead to substantial reductions in death and disability from this important public health problem.' This shows that white men are more likely to be involved in a firearm suicide and the number of deaths increases with age . White females are also more likely to kill themselves using a gun, however the total peaks with women in their late-40s to early-50s and then declines . This bar chart reveals that the United States is far ahead of other countries in the world when it comes to gun-related deaths, whether that is suicide or homicide. In comparison, the country has low levels of violence as a result of assault .","Report published in this year's Annual Review of Public Health .
In 13 states, gun deaths are already exceeding those killed in cars .
The rate of suicides alone is greater  in five of those states .
Has been caused by a steady decline in the number of vehicle deaths .

"The gun used in a 2013 gang-style shooting in Phoenix, Arizona has been traced to an ill-fated Obama administration program that tried in vain to track firearms across the Mexican border to drug kingpins, and grisly pictures released Thursday show the aftermath. Carlos Rocha-Lopez and Jobani Flores were shot and left for dead by a criminal assailant who got his AK-47 rifle along with 39 other guns on a single day from a single store because the federal government instructed a gun dealer to sell them to him. Judicial Watch, a center-right watchdog group, obtained the disturbing images through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the Department of Justice, whose Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) ran the failed 'Operation Fast and Furious' program that put the military-style rifle on the streets. The group's investigators matched up the serial number from the gun in crime-scene photos to a weapon the federal government allowed to 'walk' across America's southern border. BLOODY SHOOTING: A Phoenix apartment where two people were shot with a gun purchased as part of the federal government program . The AK-47: A legal gun to own, but ATF agents instructed gun dealers to sell hundreds of them to people they knew would sneak them into Mexico . AFTERMATH: Jobani Flores was hospitalized with life-threatening injuries . 'Attorney General Eric Holder has already admitted that guns from the Fast and Furious scandal are expected to be used in criminal activity on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border for years to come,' Judicial Watch said in a statement to DailyMail.com. Press reports at the time of the shooting that wounded two people described an AK-47 rifle in the front passenger compartment of a vehicle that had crashed into a fence surrounding an apartment complex. US Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry was shot to death by a Mexican national with a gun put into circulation by Operation Fast and Furious . Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley and California Rep. Darryl Issa, both Republicans, confirmed in an October 16 letter to Deputy Attorney General James Cole that the serial number on the gun matched one of the 2,000 Fast and Furious guns that the DOJ instructed gun dealers to sell to 'straw' purchasers. In this case, the buyer purchased 40 guns in a single day – all while under the watchful eye of the ATF. 'We can confirm that the assault rifle recovered in the vehicle on July 30, 2013, was purchased by Sean Christopher Stewart,' the senators wrote. 'Stewart pled guilty to firearms trafficking charges resulting from his involvement with Operation Fast and Furious.' 'Stewart purchased this particular firearm on December 8, 2009, one of 40 that he purchased that day while under ATF surveillance.' Three weeks after the Phoenix shooting, detectives federal investigators from the Department of Homeland Security found numerous rifles and handguns after they served search warrants in the case. SERIAL NUMBER: Judicial Watch reported that members of Congress confirmed this gun, used in the shooting, was part of the arms cache released into criminals' hands by the Justice Department . Carlos Rocha-Lopez, another shooting victim, was bloodied so badly that his wallet was soaked through . SCENE OF THE CRIME: The grisly photos were made public as part of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit . Homeland Security's involvement was a signal that the Obama administration was taking an unusual interest in the case, according to Judicial Watch, since the Phoenix ATF office was the hub of activity during the years-long run of Operation Fast and Furious. Weapons released to criminal elements in the program have been connected to the deaths of hundreds of Mexican nationals and one U.S. Border Patrol agent,  Brian Terry. 'These crime scene photos graphically illustrate the legacy of President Obama and Eric Holder’s deadly Fast and Furious lies,' Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said in a statement. 'Even as the evidence and casualties mount, the Obama administration is still secreting information about its reckless program. These photos show the American people firsthand the bloody consequences when an out-of-control administration will not even admit – or correct – its own mistakes.' 'Operation Fast and Furious' involved straw-buyers who sent 2,000 guns to Mexico (including these weapons) with help from the ATF, which hoped to track the firearms to drug cartels – but failed .","Phoenix gang-style shooting in 2013 was carried out with an AK-47 purposely sold to gun-runners under the watchful eye of the ATF .

"A Philadelphia woman has pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and child endangerment after her 2-year-old son picked up a loaded .357 revolver and fatally shot his 11-year-old sister. The toddler found the gun under a bed and shot Jamara Stevens while their mother, 31-year-old Tiffany Goldwire, was in the bathroom on April 5, prosecutors said. Goldwire told police that a male friend she knew only as Mark left the loaded gun on top of the refrigerator the night before.

But Goldwire told police she was drunk and high that night, according to Assistant District Attorney Joanne Pescatore. 'It's a very, very big gun,' Pescatore said. 'How irresponsible. She just lets this man come in — on more than one occasion — and leave a gun there. 'It's not a high refrigerator, and there's a chair right there. Any kid could have crawled up there and gotten it.' Goldwire's four children were playing in the bedroom when the toddler, who was on the floor, found the loaded, cocked gun and fired, prosecutors said. The mother faces eight to 17 years in prison when she is sentenced on February 27. The mother faces eight to 17 years in prison when she is sentenced on February 27 . She was on probation at the time of the shooting from an earlier arrest on weapons and terroristic threat charges, Pescatore said. A veteran homicide prosecutor, she could not recall a case that involved a child that young getting hold of a gun. Defense lawyer Eugene Tinari said his client pleaded guilty so that her teenage son would not be forced to testify against her at trial. He said he will ask for Goldwire to be released on time already served early next year so the family 'can start the healing process.' 'She's mostly concerned about trying to get back to her children and put their lives back together,' Tinari said.

"Fit for trial: Anissa Weier, 13, now understands her charges and can face court, a judge ruled Thursday . A psychiatrist has determined the second of two girls charged with stabbing a classmate 19 times in an attempt to please a fictional character called Slender Man is now mentally fit to stand trial, a judge ruled Thursday. However the attorney for Anissa Weier, 13, has disputed the finding, claiming to have a report from another doctor declaring the Wisconsin girl incompetent. Both reports are sealed. Waukesha County Circuit Judge Michael Bohren said the girl is competent to stand trial. The decision means Weier's case will now move to a preliminary hearing, where prosecutors would have to establish that she committed  attempted first-degree intentional homicide. The judge is yet to rule on the second suspect, Morgan Geyser, who was committed for treatment in August after displaying disturbing behavior during interviews, including squatting on her chair, laughing hysterically for no reason and constantly looking in corners. Prosecutors have charged both girls with attempted first-degree intentional homicide in the attack in May in Waukesha, a city of 71,000 about 15 miles west of Milwaukee. They say the girls plotted for months to kill classmate Payton Leutner, luring her to a wooded park after a sleepover and stabbing her 19 times. After her attackers left, Leutner crawled through the woods to a sidewalk where a bicyclist found her and called 911. The two girls charged in the case were found walking toward a national forest where they said they believed Slender Man lived in a mansion. Scroll down for video . Intent to kill: Weier and Geysor's victim, Payton Leutner, survived the attack, and has since returned to school. Pictured above: Leutner recieves help on the morning of the attack . Recovering: Leutner was stabbed so severely she could not speak following the attack . In court: Weier is pictured in court in June, but doctors have deemed she is yet not competent to stand trial . They told investigators they believed killing Leutner would curry favor with the figure. Slender Man is in the internet generation's version of the Boogeyman. He first appeared as a blurry figure in the background of some photos posted online around 2009, with nonsense stories soon circulating that his presence meant something bad was going to happen. Like the Boogeyman, Slender Man is meant to kill children. Wisconsin law requires anyone accused of certain serious crimes to be charged as adults if they are 10 or older. All three girls were 12 at the time of the incident. Weir has since turned 13. The victim survived returned to school in September to start seventh grade. Consequences: If convicted, Weier (left) and Geyser (right) could face up to 65 years in prison. But if tried in juvenile court, they would not be held past age 25 . A court-appointed psychologist testified in August that Geyser, who told police she stabbed the victim more than a dozen times, heard voices and believed she could communicate with Slender Man and other fictional characters. A psychiatrist hired by the defense, Kenneth Robbins, testified that girl was more concerned about her relationship with Slender Man than she was about going to prison. She said she communicated telepathically with Slender Man and feared he would harm her or her family if she said too much about him, Robbins said. He said she also speaks and sees Voldemort and another Harry Potter character, Snape. 'For her, these are real characters,' Robbins said. 'She sees them and they have discussions back and forth.' If convicted as adults, each could be locked up for up to 65 years. In the juvenile system, they could not be held past age 25.

"The wife of a television weatherman who was shot multiple times as he left the station on Wednesday has revealed his quick decision to drive off and flag down help saved his life. Patrick Crawford, the morning weatherman for KCEN in Bruceville-Eddy near Waco, had climbed into his car around 9.15am on Wednesday when an unknown man approached and shot him. Crawford managed to back up at high speed and drive out of the parking lot. He crossed the interstate and drove to a group of construction workers, who administered first aid and called 911. As the search for the gunman enters day two, Crawford is recovering in hospital. Police told his wife, fellow meteorologist Heather Brinkmann, that his quick thinking saved him from worse injury. Heroic: Patrick Crawford, left, was shot as he left KCEN's studio in Texas on Wednesday morning, and his wife Heather, right, said police believe he saved his life by driving off and flagging down help . 'Doctors continue to tell me how well he's doing considering the multiple gunshot wounds,' she wrote on her Facebook page on Wednesday night. 'Police tell me that if it wasn't for his smarts to hurry up and drive off and flag down construction workers, it could have been a whole different story. He is truly my hero.' She said her husband, whom she married last year, remains in stable condition. He was shot in the stomach and the shoulder, and a bullet grazed his head. Brinkmann and other KCEN employees also uploaded Superman's 'S' emblem to their Facebook pages in a sign of support for Crawford. KCEN shared the image with the hashtag '#oursuperman' to its own page. Police told the channel that they have few leads in the search for the gunman. They are interviewing Crawford and working on a sketch of the suspect, they said on Thursday. On Wednesday, they surrounded a house and took someone they thought was a person of interest into custody, but it quickly emerged he was not related to the incident. Updates: Texas Department of Public Safety officers DL Wilson, left and Harpin Myers, give a briefing on the shooting on Wednesday afternoon. By Thursday morning, a suspect had still not been taken into custody . Concerns: Law enforcement officers set up near a command post and look for the gunman on Wednesday .

Police have said that Crawford and his shooter exchanged words as he left the station and the man then opened fire. The man continued firing as Crawford quickly backed up his car then crossed an intersection and crashed near a group of construction workers. 'He was entering the car when the exchange of gunfire, or the gunfire started,' Senior Trooper DL Wilson with Highway Patrol told KHOU. 'He did an excellent job getting in the car, speeding off and probably saved his life.' He was taken to Scott and White Memorial Hospital in Temple and underwent surgery on Wednesday, and by the afternoon, friends reported that he was doing well. As he drove off, the suspect fled on foot. 'He is considered armed and dangerous at this time,' Wilson said. 'We're still going with a white male, 30 to 35, receding hairline, had a black hoodie and dark-colored pants.' Recovering: Crawford, who has been with the station for two years and married Brinkmann (right) last year, underwent surgery on Wednesday and is now in stable condition in hospital, she said . Attack: Crawford is pictured left with his fellow KCEN hosts on Wednesday - just hours before he was shot . Speaking on Wednesday afternoon, Trooper Wilson said Crawford had not recognized his attacker. Authorities have still not said if the shooting was random and KCEN said it did not know if the gunman was connected to the station in any way. Crawford, who grew up in Plano, Texas and earned his meteorology degree from Northern Illinois University, moved from New Orleans and joined the station in September 2012. He  married Brinkmann, a fellow meteorologist and KCEN producer, last year. The station's news director, Jim Hice, released a statement about the shooting on Wednesday. 'Early this morning KCEN-HD News received the devastating news that one of our own, Texas Today Meteorologist Patrick Crawford, had been shot in front of our building,' he said on KCEN. 'He is currently at Baylor Scott and White Hospital in Temple after undergoing surgery. He is in stable condition and resting.

He added that Brinkmann was by her husband's side in the hospital. 'He is a loved member of the KCEN family and our thoughts and prayers go out to him, Heather and their family,' he wrote. On Wednesday morning, just hours before he was shot, Crawford showed off his winning Christmas sweater for the station's 'Ugly Sweater Contest' and shared images online of him raising a trophy.

"Polish and Israeli Holocaust researchers say they have discovered the exact location of the building that housed gas chambers at Sobibor, one of the death camps operated by Nazi Germany in occupied Poland. Israel's Yad Vashem and the Majdanek State Museum in Poland, which oversees Sobibor, announced the finding Wednesday, calling it an important discovery in the field of Holocaust research. Historians already knew that the Germans operated the gas chambers at Sobibor from April 1942 to October 1943, killing an estimated 250,000 Jews brought from across Europe. Scroll down for video . Archaeologists have finally found the exact site of Sobibor death camp after eight years of searching . Thousands of personal items were also recovered, including gold teeth and jewellery . Archaeologists from Israel and Poland were involved in the dig in the east of modern-day Poland . But they have many unanswered questions about the operation of the site because there were very few survivors and most of the site was dismantled during the war by the Germans. 'Any small piece of information we can add to our knowledge is a great thing,' said Yoram Haimi, an Israeli archaeologist who has spent the past eight years digging at the site. The team that found the remains of the building also includes Polish and Dutch archaeologists. Photos released by the researchers show a sizeable rectangular structure with brick walls that was divided into four chambers. Mr Haimi said they have found a number of personal items nearby, including gold teeth and jewellery. An estimated 250,000 Jews were killed at the death camp between April 1942 and October 1943 . A ring with a Hebrew inscription reading: 'Behold, you are consecrated unto me' The Germans closed the camp after a prisoner revolt on October 14, 1943, when about 300 of the young inmates killed several German officers and guards with axes and knives . David Silberklang, a historian with Yad Vashem, said the finding will shed light on 'what the Jews went through until they were murdered' and could lead to a more precise estimate of the numbers killed. The Germans closed the camp after a prisoner revolt on October 14, 1943, when about 600 of the young inmates killed several German officers and guards with axes and knives. Many of the prisoners fled the camp, but all except 52 of them were killed by guards or died in water ditches and mine fields surrounding the camp. The excavations have been made more difficult because the Nazis tried to destroy all evidence of the death camp after the revolt, and planted crops over the site. Similarly to Belzec and Treblinka, which the Nazis at around the same time, Sobibor was designed as a death camp, where Jews were gassed almost straight after arriving. The excavations have been made more difficult because the Nazis tried to destroy all evidence of the death camp after the revolt, and planted crops over the site. 1. The garrison area: This is where the main entrance gates were, and also where the inmates were taken off the trains. The Commander's house was opposite the platform between the guardhouse and the armoury. 2. Camp I: This was made with barbed wire fences and surrounded by a deep, water-filled trench. It was where the Jewish prisoners lived and also included a kitchen. Each prisoner had about one square metre of space to sleep in. 3. Camp II: Around 400 prisoners worked in this larger camp which was used to store killing equipment and also items taken from the prisoners. The Jews were prepared to be killed here, meaning they were undressed and women had their heads shaved. There was a barbed wire-lined pathway which led from here to where they were killed. 4. Camp III: The prisoners were killed here, in the north west area of the camp. Their entrance descended straight down into the gas chambers and was decorated with a Star of David and flowers.","Polish and Israeli archaeologists have found remains of the building .

"Monkey calls are far more sophisticated than previously thought - and the primates can even form basic 'sentences' to communicate. Researchers even found the same species of monkeys located in separate geographic regions use their alarm calls differently to warn of approaching predators, a linguistic analysis by a team of scientists reveals. The study, which appears in the journal Linguistics and Philosophy, reveals that monkey calls have a more sophisticated structure than was commonly thought. Campbell's monkeys have a distinction between roots and suffixes, which allows the monkeys to describe both the nature of a threat and its degree of dange . 'hok' warns of serious aerial threats - usually eagles - . 'hok-oo' can be used for a variety of general aerial disturbances; in effect the suffix -oo serves as a kind of attenuator. 'krak' usually functions as a leopard alarm call in Tai, but as a general alarm call – to warn of all sorts of disturbances, including eagles – on Tiwai . 'Our findings show that Campbell's monkeys have a distinction between roots and suffixes, and that their combination allows the monkeys to describe both the nature of a threat and its degree of danger,' said the study's lead author, Philippe Schlenker of France's National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) and a Global Distinguished Professor at New York University. The combined team of linguists and primatologists analyzed alarm calls of Campbell's monkeys on two sites: the Tai forest in Ivory Coast and Tiwai Island in Sierra Leone. Notably, monkey predators on the two sites differ: the primates are threatened by eagles on Tiwai Island and by eagles and leopards in the Tai Forest. Using transcriptions of these monkey calls gathered in field experiments involving playbacks of predator calls (e.g. eagle shrieks and leopard growls), the researchers found greater complexity in expression than previously understood as well as differences in alarm calls between the two locations. Their analysis showed that these calls make a distinction between roots (especially 'hok' and 'krak') and suffixes (-oo), and that their combination allows the monkeys to describe both the nature of a threat and its degree of danger. For instance, 'hok' warns of serious aerial threats—usually eagles—whereas 'hok-oo' can be used for a variety of general aerial disturbances; in effect the suffix -oo serves as a kind of attenuator. Moreover, their results suggest that the calls are not used in the same way in the Tai Forest and on Tiwai Island. For instance, 'krak' usually functions as a leopard alarm call in Tai, but as a general alarm call – to warn of all sorts of disturbances, including eagles – on Tiwai. The article seeks to explain why this 'dialectal variation' is found. The combined team of linguists and primatologists analyzed alarm calls of Campbell's monkeys on two sites: the Tai forest in Ivory Coast and Tiwai Island in Sierra Leone. The authors' preferred analysis is based on the device of 'implicatures,' borrowed from the pragmatics of human languages. It posits that the meaning of a word can be enriched when it competes with a more informative alternative – for instance, 'possible' competes with 'certain,' which is more informative, and for this reason 'possible' usually comes to mean 'possible but not certain' (for instance in: 'It's possible that John is the culprit' – which implies that this is not a certainty). The authors propose that 'krak' always has a meaning of general alarm, but that in Tai it comes to be enriched by competition with 'hok' (meaning: aerial threat) and 'krak-oo' (meaning: weak threat) – with the result that it is enriched with a 'not 'hok' ' component (hence: the threat is a non-aerial threat) and a 'not 'krak-oo' ' component (hence: the threat is not weak). This yields a meaning of a 'serious ground-related threat,' closely associated with leopards. In the long term, Schlenker observes, the research should help initiate the development of a form of 'primate linguistics'—the application of sophisticated methods from contemporary formal linguistics to systems of animal communication.","Researchers studied Campbell monkeys in Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast .

"A toddler's father has accidentally sliced off one of her feet with a lawnmower. Eighteen-month-old Roseanne Mendez was playing in her family's garden in North Fresno, California on December 7 as her father, Reyes Mendez, trimmed the edges of the grass. The youngster was climbing on a swing set with her siblings and she came off the slide, the lawnmower cut off her foot, KMPH reported. Mr Mendez ran to a nearby house and frantically asked neighbor Lisa Bertelsen to call 911. Scroll down for video . Recovering: Eighteen-month-old Roseanne Mendez, pictured left in hospital and right with her mother, lost a foot to her father's lawnmower as he was cutting the grass near her slide earlier this month . 'I came to their front yard,' she recalled to KMPH. 'Mom handed me the baby with a blood soaked towel on her foot.' The little girl was flown to UC San Francisco's Pediatric Unit and her foot was kept in a bag of ice. When she arrived, doctors tried to reattach her foot but it wouldn't take. She continues to recover in hospital as her family stay nearby. Her father, the family's breadwinner, has not been able to work since the accident and although they are staying at a Ronald McDonald House next to the hospital, they still need to pay for food. Fresno Police Officer Paige McQuay, who responded to the call on December 7, has been fundraising for the family, which has four children. He recalled how he was deeply affected when he arrived at the scene following the call. Accident: Police said no one was to blame for the freak accident. The family's lawnmower is pictured . On the mend: Roseanne was flown to a San Francisco hospital but doctors were unable to reattach the foot . 'Immediately you start thinking about your children,' the father-of-five said. 'It could happen to anybody, any family.' He said that after the accident, he wondered how the family would get by. 'I knew the family was going to be hurting for money,' he said. 'I decided it would be beneficial to do what I could to encourage other people to help.' One of his daughter decorated mason jars with signs reading, 'The Roseanne Mendez Get Well Fund', and places them throughout police stations. A week later, they had raised more than $600 in the jars and the Fresno Police Chaplaincy also donated another $1,000 to the family. Shock: Fresno Police Officer Paige McQuay, who responded to the scene, said he worried how the family would get by after the accident because Roseanne's father stopped working so he could be near the hospital . Thankful: He has raised thousands of dollars for the family and delivered it to them in the hospital at the weekend (pictured). He said the family were overwhelmed by the generosity of the public . McQuay personally delivered the money to the family in San Francisco on Sunday, and although the parents do not speak English, he said he could see how appreciative they were. 'I could see them start shaking their heads and crying,' he said. Obviously they are sincerely, grateful for the help they are being given, without asking.' A gofundme page has also been set up to raise funds for the girl and her family. Police said no one is to blame for the 'freak' accident and that no charges will be brought.

"'Bondage master' Bob Bashara has been found guilty of first-degree murder in a plot to kill his wife so he could devote himself to a life of domination with other women in an upper-class Detroit suburb. The salacious trial of the 57-year-old revealed his secret life in Grosse Pointe Park: a former Rotary Club president who used cocaine and hosted men and women at a sex dungeon underneath a bar called the Hard Luck Lounge. The father-of-two arranged the killing of his wife Jane Bashara who was strangled by a handyman in the couple's garage in 2012. Her body was then discovered in her Mercedes-Benz in a Detroit alley. Scroll down for video . Bob Bashara, 57, (pictured during a hearing in 2012) has been convicted of first-degree murder. Jane Bashara was strangled by a handyman, who Bashara coerced into committing the crime, in the couple's garage . Strangled: Jane Bashara, right, was found dead in her Mercedes SUV in January 2012 a day after her husband Bob, left, reported her missing. He repeatedly professed his innocence in the aftermath of her death . 'What man would make his own elderly mother hide a gun for him?' prosecutor Rob Moran said in closing arguments as he recalled evidence. 'What kind of man has two women come to the marital bed and have sex with them while his wife is out of town? Is that what a man does who's in love with his wife? No. It's the ultimate act of betrayal.' The handyman, Joe Gentz, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in 2012 and said Bob Bashara coerced him into committing the crime. But as the trial was set to begin in October, Gentz said he wouldn't testify. Bashara didn't testify but repeatedly professed his innocence in the weeks after his wife's death, even attending a candlelight vigil in her honor. Jane Bashara was a marketing executive with a long record of service to her church and community. Nearly three years later, there still are lawn signs that say, 'Justice For Jane.' Defense attorneys urged the jury to keep their focus on the killer, Gentz, not Bob Bashara. They said Bashara could have continued his affairs and alternative lifestyle without getting rid of his wife. 'She is the breadwinner,' Michael McCarthy said in his final remarks. 'Why would he want her dead? ... There is reasonable doubt in this trial.' Bashara's former business associate testified the married father of two had operated a sex dungeon under a bar he owned called the Hard Luck Lounge (pictured) Joe Gentz (right) is already serving 17 years in prison for the murder of Jane Bashara but has refused to testify against her husband, Bob . Bashara is already in prison for trying to have Gentz killed in jail in 2012. During the murder trial prosecutors called several witnesses to the stand including a bartender, a local Grosse Pointe business owner and a medical examiner who testified his wife, Jane Bashara, had very few defensive injuries - indicating she did not have the ability to fight back. Prosecutors told jurors on  that the trial had revealed how Bashara lived a secret life in suburban Detroit. 'He created one world; he was living in another,' prosecutor Lisa Lindsey said during closing remarks. 'And when those two worlds collided, Jane Bashara ended up dead.' The prosecution said the life he created revolved around 'Master Bob' and his desire to maintain control and create a new life with his mistress. The prosecution used Bob's own words to tell pat of the story. First, pointing out how Bob worked to get police to investigate other theories, such as his wife Jane's alleged drug use and that she may have been killed by a drug dealer. Bob's own emails took center stage and revealed his intense desire to be with his mistress and not his wife. During the salacious trial Bob's own emails took center stage and revealed his intense desire to be with his mistress and not his wife (left) 'He would say anything and do anything to be with Rachel Gillett. Several people have indicated such,' said Lindsey. Bob's connection to Joe Gentz -- the calls, the text message and the desire to take him out -- was pointed out once again to jurors. During the long trial, jurors heard testimony from police, the Bashara children, friends and even girlfriends who talked about Bashara's sex dungeon below a bar, the Hard Luck Lounge. He was known as 'Master Bob.' Bashara's mistress, Rachel Gillett, told the jury that they had talked about bringing another woman into their relationship. The defense admitted that Bashara had major financial problems but he knew his wife had a job and savings. His defence argued that it would not have made sense for him to kill his wife when he had a steady stream of income.me. There is no dispute that handyman Joe Gentz killed Jane Bashara, but Lindsey said he was threatened and coerced to do it by Bob Bashara. Jane was murdered in their large home in the affluent Grosse Pointe Park suburb in Detroit . Jurors didn't hear from Gentz. He pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in exchange for a minimum sentence of 17 years in prison, but then said he wouldn't testify against Bashara. In the second week of the trial, the court has heard how the 56-year-old was allegedly chomping at the bit to begin his new life with mistresses, Rachel Gillett and Janet Leehmann. During emotional and lengthy testimony on Thursday, Gillett revealed that Bashara blindfolded her and another unidentified woman in 2009 during the start of their affair and took them to his family home while his wife and children were out of town. The three then had sex in his marital bed, despite Bashara's alleged erectile dysfunction. But Gillett told the court she was so upset with herself that she slept on the floor afterwards, even though she had been told that his wife was dead and he was a widower. The assistant medical examiner in Wayne County, Dr. Francisco Diaz, told the court in during Bashara's first trial in 2012 that Jane Bashara died from a combination of injuries, which included repeated blunt force trauma and strangulation resulting in her windpipe being crushed. Wayne County Assistant Prosecutor Lisa Lindsey told the court in opening statements last week that Jane Bashara's body was 'dumped in an alley like a piece of common trash.' During the first week his friend and fellow BDSM community member, Patrick Webb outlined how he met Bashara at a sex party he hosted. He told the jury that Jane Bashara, 56, clearly did not approve of his lifestyle and that Bashara told him he felt 'trapped' by the marriage to the mother of his two children. 'He wanted to do more with the lifestyle but he felt trapped with…Jane — with his wife. He didn't use her name,' said Webb to the courtroom. Mistress Rachel Gillett described details of the couple's kinky sex life during testimony. He reacted emotionally to testimony by some of the witnesses during the case . 'As people talked about divorce one night, it was let out that 'it would be cheaper to kill the b**ch,'said Webb according to CBS Detroit. Also on the stand during the trial has been Bashara's former mistress, Rachel Gillett, who he referred to as his slave as part of their BDSM relationship. She told the court that she met Bashara on a BDSM website and after initially telling her he was a widower, admitted that he was still married, but seeking divorce during their three year affair. During his prior trial in 2012, his other mistress, Janet Leehmann, told the court how 'Master Bob' would send her dirty letters, a leather collar and a T-shirt he had worn for three days straight so she could smell his scent. Leehmann, who Bashara met on a BDSM website told the courtroom she regular engaged in 'breath play' with the accused wife murderer and agreed to having a polyamorous relationship to stop him cheating. Leehmann testified that Bashara planned a trip from Grosse Pointe Park, Michigan to Oregon to visit her in January 2012, shortly before his wife, Jane Bashara, was killed. Prior to him arriving he sent her numerous notes and messages including one saying: 'Hello SJ (her alt.com name). Soon you will feel my strength and passion.' He also described how Gillett loved breath play - an erotic choking game. 'I can choke her just enough to make her woozy,' Leehmann recalled Bashara telling her of Gillett. 'I can do the same to you.' And when he arrived at her home he did. 'He was standing behind me, he wrapped his hands around my neck and I passed out cold,' she testified. When asked by Lindsay if she consented to the asphyxiation, she said, 'no, not really.' Leehmann said he responded: 'Well little girl you should have told me you were getting bad, I could have stopped.' Final arguements: Bob Bashara, left, speaks to his attorney Michael McCarthy during a break during closing arguments in this trial . When asked if they engaged in sexual contact, she said no, adding that she was surprised. 'It doesn't work, his private parts,' she told the courtroom. 'I was surprised. He said he thinks it has to do with his weight.' In their opening statements last week, Assistant Prosecutor Lisa Lindsey told the court that evidence will show that Bashara and Gillett were planning to buy a house where they could live with a 'second slave' - Leehman. The case has rocked the affluent community of Grosse Pointe, with its white picket fences and manicured lawns. Before his wife's death, Bashara was a successful local businessman, head of the local Rotary Club, a deacon at the local church and a backer of the Lochmoor Country Club in Grosse Pointe Woods. Indeed, one month before his wife's murder, Bashara allegedly called his friend, James Wilson and asked him to cover for him. 'Bob called and said … 'I need you to cover for me this weekend. If anybody asks you (tell them) I'm with you,' said Robert Bashara's longtime friend, James Wilson on Monday. According to CBS Detroit, the court heard how Bashara and Wilson would regularly smoke pot and take cocaine before they played golf at the club. Furthermore, Wilson told the court that Bashara confided in him that he liked 'to spank girls' but that his wife did not like it.","Trial of the 57-year-old revealed his secret life in Grosse Point Park, Detroit .

"Yet another woman has stepped forward to accuse Bill Cosby of drugging her when she a young aspiring model. The woman, who identified herself only as Lisa, told Dr Phil in an exclusive interview that she was just 21 in 1988 when the comedian told her modeling agency that he wanted to meet her. 'I was very excited to go and see him,' Lisa told Dr. Phil, in an interview that will air in full on Friday. 'I was starstruck. I felt invincible. I couldn't believe that he wanted to see me.' When she met with him for the first time, 'he was a gentlemen and he was respectful and kind,' she said. 'He seemed very interested in me, and that made me feel very secure in seeing him again.' Scroll down for videos . Speaking out: Lisa, pictured, said she was just 21 when she was drugged by Bill Cosby in his hotel room . On another occasion, she took her sister and mother to meet him, and they were thrilled. 'My mother trusted Bill completely,' she said. 'I trusted him like I trusted my own father.' Then one day, he called her out of the blue and said he wanted to see her at his hotel room to give her career advice, she said. She went to his suite alone. While there, he said he wanted to see her acting skills and gave her some lines to read, she said. She claimed that he offered her a small, brown drink, saying it would relax her before reading the lines. She initially refused, saying she didn't drink, but he insisted so she acquiesced. 'He made a second drink and had me drink the second drink as well,' she said. 'I noticed myself getting a little dizzy.' Cosby sat on the edge of a couch and told her to sit down. He had his legs open and she sat between them with her back to his crotch, she said. 'He started to stroke my hair back in a petting motion,' she said. 'The last thing I remember is just feeling the strokes on my head. After that, I don't remember anything else.' Younger years: At the time, she was an aspiring model and Cosby had offered to give her career advice . 'We trusted him': Lisa said that Cosby even agreed to meet with her sister, center, and mother . Impressed: She said that her mother, pictured, trusted Cosby - but that that trust was ultimately broken . She said that she blacked out and woke up two days later in her own bed. During her interview, Dr Phil asked if she knew if the comedian had sexually assaulted her. 'No,' she responded. She said part of the problem in going to the police was that she did not know what had happened to her. But she wanted him to know that she knew he had done something wrong. Lisa joins more than two dozen women who have claimed in recent weeks that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted them in incidents stretching back to the 1960s and as recently as the 2000s. Dr Phil told her that Cosby's daughter, Evin, had released a statement. 'Rape is a serious allegation, and it is supposed to be taken very seriously, but so is falsely accusing someone,' it read. 'When someone rapes a person they go to prison. That should also happen the person that has wrongfully accused an innocent victim.' Lisa responded: 'No one remembers after they were drugged. Little bits and pieces of what has happened when they were drugged, they remember everything up until they were drugged, but they don’t remember after. Anger: Lisa, left, spoke to Dr Phil with other women who say they were drugged and raped by Bill Cosby, including Helen Hayes (right), who said to Cosby and his wife: 'Shame on you, shame on you!' 'So where's that time? All of us just blacked out miraculously, because we were around Bill Cosby from the shock of him being a star? I mean honestly.' Although she had initially not wanted to speak out, she said she decided to come forward after model Janice Dickinson accused Cosby of raping her. On the show, Lisa was joined by six other accusers who have already spoken out against the comedian: Kristina Ruehli, PJ Masten, Victoria Valentino, Helen Hayes, Beth Ferrier and Chelan. 'A body knows when it’s raped,' Masten said on the show. 'You not only rape physically but you are raped emotionally. and your spirit is gone forever. And he is a serial rapist. We all have that same thing in common. We all feel that.' Hayes added: 'Hopefully it'll dissipate and I don't have to carry the shame anymore.' She also had a message for Bill and his wife, Camille Cosby, who has stood by her husband and slammed the media coverage of 'rumors' about her husband. 'Shame on you shame, shame on you, shame on you,' Hayes said. Standing by her man: Camille Cosby, pictured with her husband in November, broke her silence this week to slam the media's coverage of the accusations, suggesting it was Cosby who was the real victim . The show will air on Friday, and they will be joined by attorney Gloria Allred and Kathleen Phelps, a former Playboy bunny who maintains he is a respectful man and friend. Cosby  has denied any wrongdoing and no criminal charges have ever been brought - but in 2006, he did settle a civil lawsuit with a woman who claimed he drugged and raped her in 2004. Earlier this week, Camille Cosby broke her silence. She compared the media's handling of the reports to Rolling Stone's botched coverage of the UVA rape scandal. 'There appears to be no vetting of my husband's accusers before stories are published or aired,' she said. 'An accusation is published, and immediately goes viral... None of us will ever want to be in the position of attacking a victim. But the question should be asked - who is the victim?'","A woman named Lisa told Dr Phil that she was just 21 when Cosby asked to meet with her and gained the trust of her family .

"The owners of the Miss World pageant have announced that there will be no swimsuit round in next year's competition. In an interview with Elle, chairwoman Julia Morley explained: 'I really... don't need to see women just walking up and down in bikinis. It doesn't do anything for the woman. And it doesn't do anything for any of us.' She added: 'I don't care if someone has a bottom two inches bigger than someone else's. We are really not looking at her bottom. We are really listening to her speak.' Scroll down for video . Big move: The owners of the Miss World pageant have announced that there will be no swimsuit round in next year's competition. Pictured: 2014 winner Rolene Strauss (middle) after getting the crown . Miss World, which was founded in 1951 by Mrs Morley's late husband Eric, started as a contest dedicated exclusively to swimwear called the Festival Bikini Contest. But recently, she has come to feel that the swimsuit round is archaic and unnecessary. As such, the pageant has elected not to broadcast the bikini portion of the show in recent years, judging the girls privately in front of a small panel instead. But as of 2015, they plan to do away with the swimsuit round altogether. 'We don't want to just make them feel like they are walking bodies, you know?' explained Mrs Morley. Mrs Morley, who is in her seventies, also revealed that she is hoping to set her competition apart from other pageants by emphasizing brains and personality over physical beauty. Flashback: Miss World, founded in 1951 by  Eric Morley, started as a contest dedicated exclusively to swimwear. (Left, 1956 winner Petra Schurmann. Left, 1971 winner Xiomara Paguaga Rodríguez) Change of hands: After Mr Morley's death in 2000, his wife Julia took over. Pictured: The Miss World 1975 contestants in their swimsuits . One step was the creation of Beauty with a Purpose, the service element of the competition which she started in 1974. In order to win this part of the event, the contestant must be judged as having done the most relevant and important charity project in her nation. This year's  Miss World winner, Rolene Strauss of South America, was crowned last weekend, and it's clear to see why she best represents what the competition stands for. The 22-year-old is a fourth year medical student and science is clearly in her blood. Her parents are a doctor and nurse, and in a pre-taped interview for the pageant, Rolene said that becoming Miss South Africa and Miss World and studying medicine were her 'childhood dreams'. Stike a pose: Miss Ireland 1987 Adriene Rock wears a glittery one-piece that is truly a sign of the times . Group shot: Eight of the beauty queens from the 1981 Miss World Competition pose for a photo in short shorts, tank tops and heels . 'Everyone in my town called me Little Dr Strauss,' she said. 'Because I was always the little curly-headed girl running around behind my dad in the hospital. 'I'm a test tube baby and I believe my passion for health was born with me,' she added. As well as being a medical student, Rolene is bilingual and speaks fluent English, as well as Afrikaans. Paying tribute to her country after being crowned, she said: 'South Africa this is for you. I think I will brace myself for what's about to happen. It's a huge responsibility.'

Good example: The 22-year-old from South Africa (middle) is a fourth year medical student and speaks fluent English, as well as Afrikaans . By eliminating the swimsuit round, Mrs Morley says she hopes to distinguish her pageant from those like the Donald Trump-owned Miss Universe, which places a large emphasis on the bikini contest. In fact, following the death of her husband in 2000, Mr Trump apparently called Mrs Morley to ask if she was 'ready to throw in the towel'. His comments prompted her to take out a $5million loan in order to bolster the company. 'They are not little girls,' she said of her contestants. 'This is what I want to get away from. This sort of ""cute"" image. No offense to Mr. Trump.'","In recent years, Miss World has judged the swimsuit portion in front of a small panel instead of broadcasting it on TV, but as of 2015 they plan to do away with it altogether ."
"Nine goals, two red cards and a comical goalkeeping error - who said Italian football was boring? A breathtaking match at the Stadio Ennio Tardini saw Filippo Inzaghi's AC Milan continue their promising start to the Serie A season by edging Parma 5-4. Strikes from Giacorno Bonaventura and Keisuke Honda, a breathtaking run and finish from Nigel de Jong and a brace from Jeremy Menez - one from the spot, another a quite sublime backheel - ensured Milan joined Roma and Juventus at the top of the table.

For De Jong's goal, the former Manchester City midfielder won the ball in the middle of the park and ran completely unopposed from the halfway-line towards the Parma goal. He then slotted the ball superbly past the advancing Mirante. Menez, meanwhile, capitalised on a defensive mistake to nick the ball ahead of the Parma goalkeeper, slip it past him and, despite running away from goal, audaciously backheel the ball into the net. And all of this happened despite on-loan Chelsea striker Fernando Torres being unable to make his debut due to a sprained ankle. For their part, Parma also contributed to an extremely entertaining encounter. Antonio Cassano netted against his old side, with Felipe and Alessandro Lucarelli also getting their names on the scoresheet. But it was Milan's own misgivings that led to a nervy finish. With the score at 5-3, defender Mattia De Sciglio passed the ball back towards goalkeeper Diego Lopez, who slipped horribly when attempting a clearance. The ball then rolled past the keeper and into the net. Keisuke Honda scores to put AC Milan 2-1 up against Parma at the Stadio Ennio Tardini in a thrilling match .

"When it was launched, it seemed little more than a pipe dream. Billionaire inventor Elon Musk unveiled a futuristic plan for a new type of transport that would shoot capsules of passengers along a tube at around the speed of sound. Elon Musk, one of the brains behind the online payment system PayPal, and SpaceX claims his solar-powered 'Hyperloop' could herald a revolution in travel. The Hyperloop Transportation Technologies design for Elon Musk's Hyperloop. It hopes to produce a technical feasibility study finished in mid-2015. The team believes the system could link the majority of America's major cities together. Scroll down for video . Inside the tubes, hyperloop pods are mounted on thin skis . made out of inconel,an alloy already used by Musk's SpaceX firm that can . withstand high pressure and heat. Air is pumped into the skis via small holes to make an . air cushion, and each pod has air inlets at the front. An electric turbo compressor compresses air from the nose . and routes it to the skis and to the cabin. Magnets on the skis, plus an electromagnetic pulse give . the pod its initial thrust; reboosting motors along the route would keep the . pod moving at just below the speed of sound so the system does not produce . sonic booms. Musk believes it would take just 30 minutes to travel the 381 miles from Los Angeles to San Francisco – half the time it takes in a plane – and likened the passenger experience to Disneyland's rocket ride Space Mountain. Now, the plans are beginning to take shape. A new firm, Hyperloop Transportation Technologies, is developing plans to makes the tubes a reality - and it has recruited experts from around the world. The crowdsourced firm has around 100 engineers on the projects, and nearly all of them have day jobs at companies like Boeing, NASA, Yahoo!, Airbus, SpaceX, and Salesforce. Dirk Ahlborn, the CEO of the new company, says it seemed the perfect way to develop the plans, with a site called JumpStartFund that aimed to crowdsource ideas. He got in touch with SpaceX, Musk's firm, and the work began. The team includes about 25 UCLA graduate architecture students at a facility in Playa Vista, although most members work remotely. Ahlborn hopes to have a technical feasibility study finished in mid-2015, according to Wired. So far, the team has made progress in three main areas: the capsules, the stations, and the route. 'They look at this like a blank sheet of paper on which they can realize their fantasies,' UCLA professor Craig Hodgetts said. Musk's idea is based on the pneumatic tubes that fire capsules of paperwork between floors in offices. In this case, the capsules would carry people – even cars – in low-pressure tubes to minimise turbulence and maximise speed. Musk believes it would take just 30 minutes to travel the 381 miles from Los Angeles to San Francisco – half the time it takes in a plane – and likened the passenger experience to Disneyland's rocket ride Space Mountain. On top of pylons is a hovering capsule inside a low-pressurized tube, which can reach speeds of up to 760 mph. 'The only resistance would be the air in front of the capsule, which we moved to the back by using a compressor,' Hyperloop CEO Dirk Ahlborn said. At its launch, Musk described the Hyperloop design as looking like a shotgun, with the tubes running side-by-side for most of the journey, then closing at either end to form a loop. Trains of capsules would shoot through the almost air-free tube at up to 760mph, . accelerated by magnets which would also keep each pod on a steady course. Each capsule would float on a cushion of air it creates as it speeds along – similar to an air hockey table. So far, the team has made progress in three main areas: the capsules, the stations, and the route. The proposed route of the firstHyperloop follows Interstate 5, which runs through the agriculture-richCentral Valley in California. It would take seven to ten years to build. Capsules carrying six to eight people would depart every 30 seconds, with tickets costing around £13 each way. In his proposal released . online, Musk wrote: 'Short of figuring out real teleportation, which . would of course be awesome (someone please do this), the only option for . super-fast travel is to build a tube over or under the ground that . contains a special environment.' The proposed route of the first . Hyperloop follows Interstate 5, which runs through the agriculture-rich . Central Valley in California. It would take seven to ten years to build. Musk put the price tag at around . £4billion but pointed out that that is around one-tenth of the projected . cost of a high-speed rail system that California has been planning to . build. The 100 person team is spread around the world . The tyeam has even built models in their bid to find out if Hyperloop could actually work . However, transport experts received . the proposal with scepticism, citing barriers, such as the threat of . earthquakes in the region. Musk has said he is too focused on other . projects, for example his rocket building company SpaceX, to consider . building the Hyperloop, and instead is publishing a design that anyone . can use or modify. Musk said he started thinking about the idea when plans for a 130mph (210km/h) high-speed train connection between LA and San Francisco were revealed, but now he has detailed his own version on Tesla's site. 'Flight' of the future: The hyperloop will travel the distance between Los Angeles and San Francisco in only 30 minutes . Smooth ride: 'It would have less lateral acceleration which is what tends to make people feel motion sick than a subway ride, as the pod banks against the tube like an airplane,' creator Elon Musk said . 'I originally started thinking about [Hyperloop] when I read about California's high-speed rail project which was somewhat disappointing,' he told a Google Hangout with Richard Branson last week. 'It's actually worse than taking the plane. I get a little sad when things are not getting better in the future. 'Another example would be like the Concorde being retired and the fact there is no supersonic passenger transport. I think that is sad. You want the future to be better than the past, or at least I do.' The entrepreneur made his fortune with the internet payment system PayPal before switching his skills into developing the new Falcon rocket system for Nasa and the Tesla electric car. Mr Musk claims Hyperloop would be a practical solution for city pairs separated by 1,000 miles (1,600km) or less. Beyond this distance, it would be better to take a plane, he explained. Unique: Travellers would enter aluminium pods which are mounted above the ground on columns 50 to 100 yards apart . Modern: This image shows how people would travel in the pods . But for the shorter distance, his new concept would beat the plane, he argues, because it would not waste time ascending and descending. 'You want a transport system that is roughly twice as fast as the next best alternative, that costs less, that is safer, that is not subject to weather and is more convenient,' Mr Musk said. 'If there were such a thing, I think most people would take it. In fact, it would increase the travel between the city pairs because of the increased convenience.' Experts say Musk's track record could help the plan become a reality. 'Hyperloop is quite an old science fiction idea but Elon Musk is the sort of man who could make it work,' said physicist Martin Archer from Imperial College London. Space-like: This conceptual design of the machine shows that it will have a futuristic look . Built to last: The inventor boasted that the tracks would be immune to weather and earthquakes, though it is not immediately clear how so . Creature comforts: The legroom is said to give would-be passengers a disruption-free ride . 'He's the guy who made electric cars go fast with Tesla, which many people didn't think would be possible; and he's the head of SpaceX which is the only commercial rocket builder that has managed to hook up with the International Space Station.' Musk says he will leave it to others to build the system initially. 'I have to focus on core Tesla business and SpaceX business, and that's more than enough,' he told investors of Tesla, his electric car firm. 'If nothing happens for a few years, with that I mean maybe it could make sense to make the halfway path with Tesla involvement,' Musk said. 'Hyperloop consists of a low pressure tube with capsules that are transported at both low and high speeds throughout the length of the tube,' Musk said in an exhaustive paper detailing the system posted online. 'The capsules are supported on a cushion of air.' Each of the capsules is pressurized, . and Musk says they have an emergency braking system as well as a reserve . air supply in the event of an emergency. Appealing to environmentalists: This graph shows the energy cost per passenger on different modes of transportation for the specific San Francisco-Los Angeles journey . There and back: The 'loop' portion highlights the fact that there would only be two stops . He admits the scheme came from a disdain for current systems. 'When the California 'high speed' rail was approved, I was quite disappointed, as I know many others were too. 'How . could it be that the home of Silicon Valley and JPL – doing incredible . things like indexing all the world's knowledge and putting rovers on . Mars – would build a bullet train that is both one of the most expensive . per mile and one of the slowest in the world?' Musk claims the scheme can power itself through solar energy. 'By placing solar panels on top of the tube, the Hyperloop can generate far in excess of the energy needed to operate. 'This . takes into account storing enough energy in battery packs to operate at . night and for periods of extended cloudy weather', he claims.","Musk is working with UCLA researchers to develop system .

"Leather gloves, shoes and other goods being sold in British shops and online may be made out of dogs slaughtered in horrific factories in China, it has been claimed. Dog skin produced in the slaughterhouses are used in products, labelled real leather, destined for export to the West, according to an animal rights group. Footage taken by People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) shows workers stood by a door at a slaughterhouse in the northern province of Hebei. As dogs are led through the door, the men kill them with a heavy stick. Sometimes it takes several blows to finish off the unwitting animals.

PETA founder Ingrid Newkirk said: 'PETA is sure that Britain, Australia and the U.S. are not exempt from the dog leather trade. 'Many British high-street retailers are importing cheap leather from China, so products made from dog skin are almost certainly on the shelves and in people's wardrobes. 'Skin looks the same, whoever it comes from, and Chinese dog killers are not likely to advertise their skins honestly, so it's impossible to tell if those leather gloves or wallets are made out of dog, cow, pig, or goat skin. 'PETA is calling on British shoppers to consider the terror that dogs and other animals endure when they're mercilessly slaughtered and make the safe, vegan choice in clothing and accessories for the holidays and every day.' Without conducting expensive DNA tests, it is virtually impossible to know exactly what kind of animal   leather is made from. The organisation said it visited three slaughterhouses and six processing plants in central China during a year-long investigation into the slaughter of dogs and the production of dog skin.

A dog slaughterer told PETA Asia's investigator that the facility bludgeoned and skinned 100 to 200 dogs a day. About 300 dogs are kept in the compound, and some can be seen frantically climbing over one another in an attempt to escape the packed holding cell. Although the dog-meat industry in China is well known, this is the first time that the production of Chinese dog leather has been captured on camera. News agency Reuters confirmed the use of dog skin during a visit to an open-air leather processing workshop, where workers stretched washed hides to dry in the sun. With dog meat restaurants popular in many parts of the country, several establishments later sell the animals' skin to leather producers, workers at the Hebei workshop said. 'There are restaurants that sell dog meat and people that eat dog meat,' said one leather producer, who declined to be named because he was not authorised to speak to the media. 'These places have a person who specially comes and collects the skins; they'll go to each place and take a few,' he said, referring to the producers. 'It happens all over the country.' Officials of the quasi-governmental China Leather Industry Association declined to be interviewed, saying they had no knowledge of dogs being used in leather production.

The plants PETA visited were producing leather for export, said Haleigh Chang, one of the organisation's representatives. 'One owner of a processing plant told us they export dog skin as lamb skin,' she said, adding that lack of transparency on the part of producers made it hard to estimate the size of the dog skin sector within the overall leather industry.

"Nurse Jacintha Saldanha, pictured with her husband Ben Barboza, is believed to have tried to commit suicide twice previously . The nurse who committed suicide after answering a hoax phone call about the Duchess of Cambridge made two attempts to kill herself last winter and had been prescribed antidepressants. Jacintha Saldanha, who took her own life days after the call from Australian DJs pretending to be the Queen and Prince Charles, attempted to commit suicide last December with an overdose of pills during a family visit to India. She survived after being rushed to hospital but tried to commit suicide again just nine days later by apparently jumping from a building. Ms Saldanha, 46, spent several days in intensive care before receiving psychiatric treatment and being prescribed a course of powerful antidepressants for nine months. Along with the previous suicide attempts, reported in an Indian newspaper, members of Ms Saldanha’s family have revealed that the nurse was so ashamed after taking the hoax call earlier this month that she did not tell her husband or children about it before her death, despite speaking to them by phone several times. Ms Saldanha was found hanged with a scarf at her living quarters  at the King Edward VII’s Hospital in Central London on December 7. Three days earlier, Ms Saldanha was the duty nurse who answered the prank call from Mel Greig and Michael Christian, and transferred it to a colleague. That nurse revealed confidential medical information about the pregnant Duchess, who was being treated at the hospital for acute morning sickness. The call was broadcast in Australia and made headlines around the world. Yet the closest Ms Saldanha came to telling her husband she was at the centre of the story was when she told him to watch the news, claimed family members in her home town of Mangalore, southern India. ‘The first her husband knew that she was the victim of the hoax call was when police told him she was dead. Nobody in the family knew,’ said her younger brother Naveen Saldanha, 42. ‘They spoke several times that week but she did not tell him or the kids anything about it.’ The latest insight into the nurse’s state of mind came as British police confirmed yesterday they had passed a file to the Crown Prosecution Service to determine whether any offences had been committed. Family: Jacintha Saldanha's daughter Lisha, left, son Junal, right, and husband Benedict Barbosa, centre, have also received no answers from Australian radio station 2Day FM . Ms Greig and Mr Christian could be charged with attempting to obtain medical details by deception. Further charges could be brought against Australian radio station 2Day FM if it is found to have broadcast the prank without the permission of the participants. Although Ms Saldanha’s family have previously said she did not have a history of depression, new reports suggest she has been battling the condition since at least December last year. That month, Ms Saldanha, her accountant husband Benedict Barboza, 49, their son Junal, 17, and adopted daughter Lisha, 14, attended a family wedding in Shirva, 30 miles north of Mangalore. But on December 30, just days after the devout Catholic family celebrated Christmas, Ms Saldanha is believed to have taken an overdose of pills. She was rushed to a private hospital in Mangalore, where she was treated for ‘self-harm’. Pranksters: Australian radio DJ's Michael Christian and Mel Greig who were responsible for the prank call to King Edward VII hospital . On January 8 this year, she is believed to have attempted suicide again and was treated at Father Muller Medical College Hospital for head injuries suffered in a ‘fall’. She was kept in intensive care for several days and then admitted to the psychiatric ward of the hospital, where she was treated for depression. She was discharged three days later and given a nine-month course of anti-depressants. Her family was warned there was a risk that she may attempt suicide again. Funeral: Ms Saldanha, 46, was the duty nurse when the DJs called the hospital pretending to be the Queen and Prince Charles, asking about the Duchess of Cambridge's condition . Ms Saldanha’s medication would have finished in September. It is not known if she was prescribed any more or if staff at King Edward VII’s knew of her fragile condition. Last night, her brother, an engineer in Mangalore, said: ‘We didn’t know about the first incident, but we knew about the second incident at Father Muller.’ He refused to give further details. Mr Saldanha said Jacintha spoke to her husband by telephone on the evening of the prank call, which was made at 5.30am on Tuesday, December 4, but did not tell him about her involvement. He added that she spoke to her husband and children twice the following day, but still did not reveal anything, though she told Mr Barboza to watch the news. Ms Saldanha's medication would have finished in September but it is not known if she was prescribed any more or if staff at the hospital knew of her condition . Mr Saldanha said he believes his sister did not tell her family in the  UK or India about the hoax as she felt ashamed. Mr Barboza became slightly concerned when his wife did not call on Thursday, December 6, but believed she was busy with nursing classes. On Friday morning, he called a colleague of Ms Saldanha to check on his wife. Hours later, he was told of her death by officers from Avon and Somerset Police. Last week, the body of Ms Saldanha was flown back to India and buried according to her wishes in the village of Shirva. Fighting back tears, Mr Saldanha said: ‘I want justice for my sister. I want the British authorities to get the truth. My best memory of my sister was her kindness.’ His wife, Zeena, 34, added: ‘She and the family were supposed to return to India for a holiday early next year. The last time we spoke to her was in November and she sounded so happy.’ Last week, The Mail on Sunday revealed how Ms Saldanha blamed the two DJs for her death in one of three apparent suicide notes. In another note, she criticised ‘aspects of the hospital staff’. A hospital spokesman declined to comment on reports that Ms Saldanha had previously tried to commit suicide. THE grieving family of nurse Jacintha Saldanha have sent 60 questions to the Australian media group behind the hoax phone call and the hospital where she committed suicide. In their search for answers surrounding the death, the family posed 40 questions in a letter to King Edward VII’s Hospital, where Ms Saldanha worked as a nurse and where the Duchess of Cambridge was being treated for acute morning sickness. They asked a further 20 questions in a letter to Southern Cross Austereo, the parent company of 2Day FM, whose DJs pretended to be the Queen and Prince Charles in the December 4 call, which  Ms Saldanha answered. The family of Ms Saldanha have asked 20 questions in a letter to Southern Cross Austereo, the parent company of 2day FM, whose DJs, including Mel Greig, made the call . Both letters – which have been seen by The Mail on Sunday – were sent by Labour MP Keith Vaz, who is acting as a spokesman for the family at their request. In a letter to John Lofthouse, the hospital’s chief executive, Mr Vaz wrote: ‘On December 11 the family handed you a list of questions that specifically relate to the hospital. They have not had a written confirmation of the answers. They now have additional questions [and] would like answers . .  . as soon as possible.’ Husband Benedict Barboza consoles his daughter Lisha during the burial of nurse Jacintha Saldanha at her hometown Shirva, near Mangalore in southwest India . The questions suggest the hospital may not have taken extra security measures during the Duchess’s stay. The family also ask: ‘Was there any indication that Jacintha was under increased pressure or stress in the weeks preceding her death?’ One question suggests Ms Saldanha may have been involved in a dispute with a colleague a few weeks before the Duchess was admitted. Another implies that the  46-year-old, whose body was discovered on December 7, may have been ‘spoken to’ by the hospital’s matron by telephone a day after the prank call. The letter to Southern Cross Austereo asks if there is ‘any evidence’ that 2Day FM staff called the hospital five times to alert them that they were about to broadcast the prank. The letter also questions why no staff at the station or parent company have attempted to contact the family since the hoax call. Ms Saldanha’s husband Benedict Barboza, son Junal and adopted daughter Lisha were greeted by Mr Vaz at Heathrow Airport yesterday on their return to Britain after the funeral of the nurse in India. Southern Cross Austereo could not be reached for a comment.","Jacintha Saldanha made two attempts to kill herself last winter .

Video footage from their big day shows the topless male performer, known as Quis, gliding along and handing over the rings at the alter. He appears to be lost in deep concentration as he maintains a focused gaze. The congregation sit watching, open-mouthed. Scroll down for video . Wheely in love: Bobby and Shanna Lockhart from Lubbock, Texas, decided to book a rollerskating ring bearer for their recent wedding . As he reaches his destination, Quis makes a swift exit so the ceremony can continue. Newlywed Shanna, who works in sales for an online real estate company, says she and her husband heard about Quis via social media and thought his eccentric nature fitted perfectly with what they wanted to do. Sticking to the 'wacky' theme, the church organ was adorned with candy-colored decorations and bags of chocolate were scattered around. The bridesmaids - who wore dresses in all the colors of the rainbow - were also armed with giant edible lollipops in lieu of floral bouquets. Head-turner: The performer wore a Superman outfit as he skated along, much to the congregation's amusement . Comical: The stunt triggered laughter and applause from those watching in the pews . Star guest: The Lockhart's flew in the Instagram-famous rollerskater in from Florida because they wanted to make their nuptials extra special . Novel idea: The happy couple opted for a Willy Wonka-theme - chocolates were scattered everywhere, bridesmaids carried giant lollipops in lieu of floral bouquets and even the vicar got involved wearing a candy-stripe shirt . Meanwhile, the vicar stepped out in a colorful candy-stripe shirt and chinos. When he's not playing the role of ring bearer, Quis likes to perform other zany stunts in his skimpy hero outfit. He goes by the stage name 'Superman Drawls' and to date his Instagram page has attracted more than 195,000 followers. Many fans have deemed his recent performance at the Lockhart's December 13 wedding 'epic' and 'hilarious.' Steve Conway, who was the official photographer on the day, described it as the 'best ring delivery . . . ever!' The Lockharts flew Quis in from Florida in a bid to make their nuptials extra special. Husband and wife: The Lockharts share a passionate kiss after tying the knot . Willy Wonker eat your heart out: Instead of a traditional white cake, the couple went for one in all the colors of the rainbow . Dressed to impress: Here a bridesmaid and groomsman get into the spirit of things, with sweet-themed accessories . Footage from their ceremony shows the groom pretending to look frantically for the wedding bands. It seems none of the groomsmen know where the rings are. But then all of a sudden 'Superman' rolls in to save the day. 'You can tell as he starts to come up the aisle, that the back row is kind of shocked,' Shanna, 33, told Fox News. 'Then waves of laughter, then applause, then just absolute eruption. People standing up, hooping and hollering.' Shanna and Bobby first met in 1996 as teenagers but it took more than a decade for them to finally pin down a rendezvous. 'On our first date in March of 2012 I knew this was forever!' newlywed Shannon said.

"The BBC has become embroiled in a major row with Apple over treatment of Chinese workers building the iPhone 6. Panorama secretly filmed on an iPhone 6 production line and found workers falling asleep on their 12 hour shifts. It also claimed that Apple's standards on ID cards, dormitories, work meetings and juvenile workers were being breached at the Pegatron factories. However, experts have defended Apple, claiming the BBC's report does not fairly reflect conditions in China. As part of the undercover BBC investigation, exhausted workers were filmed falling asleep on their 12 hour shifts in two factories run by Pegatron on the outskirts of Shanghai on the iPhone 6 (pictured) production line. Panorama claims  workers falling asleep on their 12 hour shifts. As well as excessive hours, it claimed that Apple's standards on ID cards, dormitories, work meetings and juvenile workers were being breached at the Pegatron factories. Reporter Richard Bilton found children digging tin ore out by hand in extremely dangerous conditions. 'I think Apple is doing as much, if not more than any other major electronics company,' Dan Viederman of Verite, which works with governments and major firms to improve working conditions and eliminate human rights violations, told Daily Mail Online. As part of the undercover BBC investigation, exhausted workers were filmed falling asleep on their 12 hour shifts in two factories run by Pegatron on the outskirts of Shanghai. One undercover reporter, working in a factory making parts for Apple computers, had to work 18 days in a row despite repeated requests for a day off. Another reporter, whose longest shift was 16 hours, told the programme: 'Every time I got back to the dormitories, I wouldn't want to move. 'Even if I was hungry I wouldn't want to get up to eat. I just wanted to lie down and rest. I was unable to sleep at night because of the stress.' As well as excessive hours, Panorama found that Apple's standards on ID cards, dormitories, work meetings and juvenile workers were being breached at the Pegatron factories. However, experts disputed the findings, and said that in fact, many of the issues are simply local customs. 'These are very complicated issues, not all of which are in Apple's control,' said Viederman, who said his firm works with Apple on the issue of migrant workers. 'Workers in China nap - and whatever the BBC found is just not indicative of conditions in China.' Apple declined to be interviewed for the programme, but said in a statement that it strongly disagrees with the programme's conclusions. 'We are aware of no other company doing as much as Apple to ensure fair and safe working conditions,' it said. 'We work with suppliers to address shortfalls, and we see continuous and significant improvement, but we know our work is never done.' Apple said it was a very common practice for workers to nap during breaks, but that it would investigate any evidence they were falling asleep while working. It said it monitors the working hours of more than a million workers and that staff at Pegatron were averaging 55 hours a week. The show featured footage of workers asleep.  Apple said it was a very common practice for workers to nap during breaks, but that it would investigate any evidence they were falling asleep while working. Poor conditions in Chinese factories were highlighted in 2010 when 14 workers killed themselves at Apple's biggest supplier, Foxconn. Panorama also travelled further down Apple's supply chain to the Indonesian island of Bangka. Reporter Richard Bilton found children digging tin ore out by hand in extremely dangerous conditions. Miners can be buried alive when the walls of sand or mud collapse. Twelve-year-old Rianto was working with his dad at the bottom of a 70-foot cliff of sand. He said: 'I worry about landslides. The earth slipping from up there to the bottom. It could happen.' Panorama tracked down a gang who collect tin from the area where Rianto was working. One of them told the programme that they sell tin to a smelter on Apple's list of suppliers. Apple says it is a complex situation on Bangka with tens of thousands of miners selling tin through many middle men . Panorama has previously come under fire for its reports, and was ordered to say sorry to Primark over a scene in a Panorama documentary showing boys in a Bangalore clothing workshop, by the BBC Trust. The trust said it was 'more likely than not' that a scene, which showed the boys 'testing the stitching' on Primark clothes, was 'not genuine'. It also apologised to Primark and the audience for a 'rare lapse in quality'.","BBC reporters secretly filmed an iPhone 6 production line in China .

"A restaurant diner made a cringing gaffe when she took a bite out of a $750 white Alba truffle that had been on display. Despite the fact that the valuable fungi was under a glass dome in the entryway of Equinox in Washington, DC, it seems the unnamed woman confused the arrangement with a free sample offering. The diner took a silver dollar-sized nibble before discarding the rest of the truffle on her bread plate. Scroll down for video . Gaffe: A diner took a bite from one of these rare white Alba truffles after confusing the entryway display at Equinox restaurant in Washington, DC, with a free sample offering . Restaurant co-owner Ellen Kassoff Gray had put the truffles on display to celebrate a promotion that allowed customers to add truffle shavings to their vegan brunch for a $20 surcharge. She says she only realized what had happened when she clocked the half-eaten truffle while walking across the dining room. She told Daily Mail Online that she politely approached the diner, who was 'indignant about it. She hadn't a clue as to what a truffle really was!' The diner even told Mrs Kassoff Gray that the taste of the truffle was not even to her liking. Fine dining: Washington DC restaurant Equinox (pictured) had put the truffles on display to celebrate a promotion that allowed customers to add truffle shavings to their vegan brunch for a $20 surcharge . The restaurateur salvaged the remaining truffle and took it to her chef husband, Todd Gray, with whom she co-owns the restaurant. 'I took it over to Todd and showed him, and he said, ""That's a $300 bite!"" she told the Washington Post. Luckily for the unwitting customer, she was not charged for her mistake. 'It was one of the costs we had to eat, literally,' Mrs Kassoff Gray said. Chef Gray, whose restaurant is a block from the White House and the first President Obama dined at after he was elected, told Daily Mail Online that the rare truffles are best served on silky pasta, eggs and wild mushrooms. Recipe for success: Chef Todd Gray and his wife Ellen Kassoff Gray, whose restaurant is a block from the White House, told us that the rare truffles are best served on silky pasta, eggs and wild mushrooms . White Alba truffles are more valuable than black or summer truffles because they are rare and can only be harvested in October and November. Chefs value them for their unique flavor and creamy, marbled flesh. Most are sourced from northern and central Italy though they can also be found in France, Croatia and Slovenia. Alba truffles are typically walnut-sized, yet can sell for up to $3,000 a pound. This month however, a record 4.16-pound truffle sold for $61,250 at Sotheby's in New York to a buyer from Taiwan.","The $750 truffle was displayed under a glass dome at the entrance of Equinox restaurant in Washington, DC .

"An Oklahoma middle school teacher has been fired for taking nearly a dozen of her students on a snack run, with two of them locked in the trunk of her sedan. Heather Cagle, a veteran math teacher and yearbook instructor at Wells Middle School in Catoosa, was suspended in October after it was revealed that she had piled 11 children into her car to go to Wal-mart in the middle of the school day. At the time, Cagle said she was trying to do 'something sweet' for her yearbook students by getting them treats. Scroll down for video . Terminated: Heather Cagle, a veteran math teacher and yearbook instructor from Oklahoma, was fired Wednesday for taking 11 students off campus without permission in October to go on a snack run, with two of the kids riding in the trunk of her car . Veteran educator: Cagle, a married mother of one, was hired by the Catoosa School District in 2005 . Cagle, a married mother of one, had been at the Catoosa school for a decade, reported Tulsa World. On October 21, Mrs Cagle invited 11 kids between the ages of 12 and 15 to go on a ride to a Wal-mart located in close proximity to the school to get some food. She placed two students in the front seat of her Honda Accord, crammed seven in the backseat and stuffed a pair of 12-year-old girls into the trunk, according to school district attorney Karen Long. The lawyer said Cagle was required to obtain signed permission from the students' parents before taking them out of school, which she had failed to do. About 50 fellow teachers, parents and former students turned up at the meeting Wednesday to support Cagle as she tearfully begged district officials for her job, telling them that she never meant to hurt anyone and vowing to never repeat her ‘terrible mistake.’ Following a six-hour hearing, the Catoosa School Board voted 4-1 to terminate Cagle's employment. 'Student safety and well-being are of paramount importance to the administration, and the administration respects and supports the board's decision, Catoosa Superintendent Rick Kibbe said in a statement. Tearful plea: During a hearing Wednesday, Cagle tearfully begged for her job, vowing never to repeat her 'terrible mistake' Blowing off steam: Cagle and her attorney said she was just trying to do something nice and 'fun' for her students . 'Catoosa Public Schools has and will continue to be a district which provides all students with a safe and appropriate learning environment.' Cagle's attorney, Richard O’Carroll, forcefully defended his client whom he called an 'exceptional teacher.' ‘There wasn't any danger and it was a farce. All you got to do is cry a lawsuit or something these days.’ O'Carroll told the station Fox23. ‘It wasn't the best judgement. She went 400 yards on an empty road through a parking lot. No one was hurt.’ The attorney representing the school said that the students suffered mental abuse, and that the teacher tried to cover up the sneaky snack run by telling the kids to keep it 'hush hush.’","Heather Cagle, 10-year math teacher at Wells Middle School in Catoosa, Oklahoma, has been terminated for violating district rules .

"Ever since Doctor Who began in 1963 it has frequently been accused of terrifying its young fans. But the man currently in charge of the series has defended its dark themes, claiming children enjoy being scared. Speaking at a screening of its Christmas Day special, writer Steven Moffat said he deliberately set out to frighten youngsters, while all the jokes are aimed at adult viewers. Scroll down for video . Thrills: Peter Capaldi as Doctor Who, who comes face to face with Santa in the Christmas Special this year . Part of the festive episode – which sees the Time Lord, played by Peter Capaldi, come face to face with Santa Claus – is so spine-tingling it had both old and young screaming in fright at the preview. His assistant Clara Oswald, played by Jenna Coleman, is stalked by an alien life form in a sequence that would not look out of place in an adult horror film. But Moffat said he was confident that young viewers who tune in on Christmas Day will not be unduly upset by the episode. He said: ‘Doctor Who is scary in the way a rollercoaster is scary. It’s not scary like being trapped outside your house at night. It is fun scary. ‘The thing people never say about hiding behind the sofa, is that hiding behind the sofa is itself fun. It is a fun thing to do. Kids like being scared of Doctor Who. It doesn’t horrify them. It doesn’t petrify them. It is just an enjoyable thrill. There is nothing wrong with a bit of adrenalin.’ Adrenaline: In the special the Doctor's assistant Clara Oswald, left, played by Jenna Coleman, is stalked by an alien life form in a sequence that would not look out of place in an adult horror film . Moffat insisted that every episode of Doctor Who softens its moments of terror with comedy. He said: ‘It will be a bit scary, then it will be funny, and the Doctor will get a bucket stuck on his foot. The Doctor turning up in in any scene anywhere makes it less scary, because a man in stupid clothes walks out of a phone box and says, “I can I save the world”.’ 'It will be a bit scary, then it will be funny': Writer Steven Moffat insisted every episode of Doctor Who softens its moments of terror with comedy . He added: ‘It is softened and made lovely by that. Kids will have nightmares about monsters whether or not Doctor Who happens. Doctor Who gives them the Doctor, a man who fights monsters and does not become one. It adds that to their dreams.’ Moffatt also argued that children are more used to scary plots than adults because their lives are intrinsically more frightening. She said: ‘The thing about children is that they are much more serious than we are. They are much more uncertain. Children live in a scarier, bigger world than we do. Imagine living in a world where everyone is taller than you. When was the last time you had to go into a school playground being shorter than people who can beat you up? ‘Children live in a more frightening world than adults do in any civilised country. The jokes in Doctor Who are for the adults. The scares are for the kids.’ The current Doctor, actor Peter Capaldi, has admitted that his interpretation of the long-running character is ‘less user-friendly’ and a ‘little darker’ than previous incarnations. Last month, 118 viewers complained about an episode that saw Clara’s boyfriend appear to die in a car crash and including suggestions that the bodies of the dead could feel the pain of being cremated. Doctor Who airs on Christmas Day at 6.15pm on BBC1.","Thrills are aimed at younger viewers, while jokes are aimed at adults .

"Dutch far-right populist lawmaker Geert Wilders is be tried for inciting racial hatred after pledging in March to ensure there were 'fewer Moroccans' in the Netherlands, prosecutors said Thursday. 'The public prosecutor in The Hague is to prosecute Geert Wilders on charges of insulting a group of people based on race and incitement to discrimination and hatred,' prosecutors said in a statement. 'Politicians may go far in their statements, that's part of freedom of expression, but this freedom is limited by the prohibition of discrimination,' it said, adding that no date had yet been set for the trial. Scroll down for video . Dutch far-right leader Geert Wilders, seen here in May  2014 in Brussels, sparked outrage over his 'fewer Moroccans' comments . The case centres on comments Wilders made at a March 19 rally after local elections. He asked his followers whether they wanted 'fewer or more Moroccans in your city and in the Netherlands?' When the crowd shouted 'Fewer! Fewer!' a smiling Wilders answered: 'We're going to organise that.' In a later TV interview, he referred to 'Moroccan scum'. The remark led to 6,400 legal complaints being lodged across the Netherlands, and criticism was even voiced within Wilders's own Party for Freedom. The remark led to 6,400 legal complaints being lodged across the Netherlands, and criticism was even voiced within Wilders's own Party for Freedom . In a written statement, Wilders says he 'said what millions of people think and believe.' Wilders says authorities 'should concentrate on prosecuting jihadis instead of me.' 'I do not retract anything I have said,' Wilders, whose Party for Freedom (PVV) is leading opinion polls. 'In my fight for freedom and against the Islamisation of the Netherlands, I will never let anyone silence me. No matter the cost, no matter by whom, whatever the consequences may be,' he said. Wilders is often reviled in Dutch immigrant communities for his fiery anti-Islam rhetoric. In the past the flamboyant politician has compared the Koran to Hitler's 'Mein Kampf' and has called Islam a fascist religion. He has become the target of death threats and who lives under 24-hour police protection. He has said he expects prosecutors to drop the charges. A court in 2011 acquitted Wilders on hate-speech charges, ruling that he had targeted a religion, which is permitted under Dutch freedom of speech laws, rather than a specific ethnic group. The far-right is on the rise across Europe, fed by disillusionment with the establishment, economic hardship and worries over immigration. In Sweden's neighbour Denmark, the Danish People's Party has seen its support soar on a platform of tight immigration, tougher punishment for criminals and more welfare spending, apparently on track to become the country's biggest party.

"Amir Khan has hit back at insults from America’s flamboyant world champion Floyd Mayweather by claiming he is more famous than the welterweight known as the best pound-for-pound fighter on the planet. And in a neat dig at Mayweather’s famed macho ego, Khan insisted he throws more punches in one round than the unbeaten world champion manages in an entire fight. Mayweather, who has earned £300million in a unbeaten 47-fight career, is looking for a super-fight with Manny Pacquiao and dismissed Khan’s plea to fight him by claiming the Bolton fighter’s ‘name doesn’t carry enough weight’. Amir Khan has announced that he will donate the £30,000 shorts he wore during his last week to charity . Khan posted two pictures of his refurbished gym and clothes from his fight with Devon Alexander on Thursday . But Khan, back in his native North West after beating Devon Alexander in Las Vegas at the weekend, was in fighting form as he held court at The Gloves Community Centre boxing gym in his hometown. ‘Mayweather says I’m not a big enough name but I am a bigger name than his opponents Maidana, Guerrero and Victor Ortiz put together. ‘I am known in places like India, Pakistan, Dubai and the UAE where they don’t even know who Mayweather is. India has a billion people, Pakistan has 180m people and I can’t even walk down the street there. I am bigger than Mayweather in a lot of places and I can help him become more famous, and earn more money.’ Khan isn’t worried that 36-year-old Mayweather could catch him out. Khan was all smiles as he talked to the assembled press at his gym in Bolton . Khan is hoping his next fight will be against Floyd Mayweather next year . ‘Mayweather throws maybe three hundred punches in a fight, I could manage that in a single round,’ he said. ‘Floyd will never hurt me. I have been knocked down in other fights but Mayweather is not the biggest puncher, not as big as Alexander. Our fight would be like a game of chess, hit-move. It would be about footwork and accuracy, nothing more, nothing less. ‘I speak to legends like Roy Jones and Thomas Hearns and they say I would beat him. Even the taxi driver I spoke to in Vegas said he hoped I would knock him out. The people there want to see him humbled . ‘But Floyd is the boss. If he doesn’t want to fight me, he won’t. He’s not the type of guy where I could just turn up to his house and have a chat about it. But maybe all this stuff about me not being a big name is a sign he might be interested, he is starting to promote the fight. I don’t think him and Pacquiao will happen.’ Khan’s homecoming to England after wowing the Vegas fans has been bittersweet. His friend Anthony Crolla, who trains in the same gym, suffered a fractured skull and broken ankle after being hit on the head by a concrete slab as he confronted burglars. Khan lands a left hand during his impressive win on decision against Alexander . Khan arrived back in Manchester along with his wife and daughter on Wednesday . Mayweather says Khan's 'name holds no weight' and that he will not fight him . And the terrorist attack that killed 132 schoolchildren in Pakistan, where Khan’s family originate from, has also affected him badly. The £30,000 pair of shorts he wore at the weekend, containing a gold waistband, will be auctioned off to raise funds for the survivors. Talking about Crolla, Khan revealed that he had volunteered to be his pal’s sparring partner ahead of his world lightweight title shot against Richar Abril in Manchester on January 23, which has now been cancelled . ‘Me and Crolla are good friends,’ said Khan. ‘I roomed with him as an amateur. ‘His trainer Joe Gallagher was at my fight in Vegas and I told him I would spar with Crollar to help him because Abril is a long fighter, and I have got long arms, I can replicate his style. It is probable that Mayweather will insist on fighting Pacquiao, an eight-division champion, in his adopted hometown of Las Vegas . FLOYD MAYWEATHER . Age 37 . Born Michigan, USA .

Draws 0 . ‘Then I got back and found he had been smashed over the head. I feel really bad, they have taken away his dream of fighting for a world title and tried to ruin his life, over nothing.’ Khan admits there must be doubts over whether Crolla can fight again. ‘When you have suffered something that bad, you have to understand the Board might not give him a license. It is very dangerous, is it worth that risk? ‘We fighters, even me in his position, would want to fight again, but sometimes you have to think of your health first.’ The attack on Crolla follows a knife attack on another potential Khan opponent, Kell Brook, in Tenerife earlier this year. The two incidents were totally unconnected but Khan says he is always conscious of trying to stay away from trouble outside boxing. ‘I don’t like fighting, I only do it when I am in the ring,’ he said.","Amir Khan back in UK after win over Devon Alexander in Las Vegas last Saturday .

"Amir Khan will donate his pair of £30,000  shorts to the Peshawar school in Pakistan where 132 children were killed by Taliban gunmen earlier this week. Khan wore the shorts, featuring a waistband made from 24-carat gold thread, in a unanimous points victory over American Devon Alexander in Las Vegas which helped him retain the WBC silver welterweight title at the weekend.

Khan is hoping his next fight will be against Floyd Mayweather next year . Khan lands a left hand during his impressive win on decision against Alexander . 'Amir is one of their members so we then got talking and it was agreed we could use the 24 carat gold to make the waistband for his shorts. 'The outside of the shorts are covered in lamb nappa leather with crocodile trim, and then the lining is 100 per cent silk, so you have to combine all those materials through different machines - so it was a jigsaw to put them all together. 'But I want every fighter to be unique and have unusual fabrics - so it was worth it. 'We started about four months ago on the training kit and then we were brainstorming ideas before putting pen to paper. 'It's probably been a four to six week period process to piece it all together and finalising all the designs for the fight night shorts. 'It's been a really exciting process working with Amir. At Fight Label I want to create people's dream shorts and make them a reality to wear. When you look good you feel good, and then you fight better too. 'Whether or not we had the material from 24KT we still strive to make unusual, unique fabrics and there's so many more different styles and trends to explore - that's why I'm in this business.'

"With an Australian flag tucked between the cheeks of his bare bottom, a man allegedly ‘mooned’ the Queen as she was driven past him in a motorcade today. Liam Warriner, from Sydney, was later charged with being a public nuisance and wilful exposure after the alleged incident, which is understood to have occurred while the 22-year-old was unloading shipping containers in Brisbane. ‘I mooned the Queen,’ Warriner said after being charged. ‘I did it because my workmates dared me to.’ Remorseless: Liam Warriner today pleaded guilty to a charge of public nuisance at Brisbane Magistrates Court. He was fined AUS$750 (£510) for 'mooning the Queen in the city last October . Guest of honour: The Queen, accompanied by Prince Philip and Queensland Premier Anna Bligh, walks down a slipway to board a cruiser on the Brisbane River. Shortly beforehand, police said the monarch was 'mooned' by Warriner as she passed him in her motorcade . Speaking with a sense of pride at his actions, Warriner added: ‘Everybody’s seen someone’s butt, come on. ‘You see it on TV all the time, you see it in movies, it’s accepted in PG rated programming these days. ‘But yet it’s an offence to the Queen.’ Warriner, who gave the V for victory sign as he spoke, said the Queen waved at him and that was when he dropped his trousers. But his claim that the Queen had singled him out for a wave was highly unlikely. Thousands of people were lining the . banks of the Brisbane River along which the Queen was sailing and most . people were so far away from the cruiser that it is doubtful she saw . what any individual was doing. Warriner said he ran for 50 yards with his trousers and underwear down, but no-one saw anything other than his bare bottom. He said: ‘Not the front at all. There were loads of people there to see the Queen. I wouldn’t want all of them seeing that.’ The Queen and Prince Philip prepare to set off down the river to view areas of Brisbane left devastated after the floods of January last year . Well-wishers: Thousands of people line the Brisbane River in the city's South Bank to wave to the Queen during the royal visit . Warriner is no stranger to protests against authority. He revealed he is part of an anti-elite protest movement called Occupy and had recently taken part in protests in Sydney. He said: ‘I’d like to say we are the 99 per cent human need over corporate greed and we won’t accept any of this any longer.' Police later clarified where Warriner had been standing. They said he was in an area at the roadside where the Queen was passing by in a motorcade before she stepped onto the cruiser to sail down the river. A spokeswoman for Queensland police said: ‘Police officers at the front of the motorcade saw the alleged incident and reported to others further back.' She said she could not comment on whether or not the Queen had seen the alleged incident.","Liam Warriner said he dropped his trousers for a dare .

"As Christmas draws near, Manchester United are back on familiar territory. A Barclays Premier League title race that was only expected to feature two contenders suddenly has a third team loitering with intent at the head of the chasing pack. Statistically, at least, United appear to be in a reasonable position. Third in the league on the back of a six-game winning run, their improvement has been enough to prompt captain Wayne Rooney to suggest this week that a 21st title triumph could yet be theirs. With the busy festive period now on the horizon, what are the reasons for United’s improvement and can manager Louis van Gaal really  take his team all the way in the first half of 2015? Louis van Gaal's United look to have crept into the Premier League title race follwing six straight wins . WINNING IS A HABIT . United’s form has, in all honesty, been rather up and down. In his more candid moments, Van Gaal probably realises that he could count the number of really convincing performances on the fingers of one hand and still have room for a mince pie. However, there were signs against Liverpool at Old Trafford last Sunday that suggested, for the first time in a long time, that United had rediscovered the belief that was always there during the Sir Alex Ferguson years. United weren’t comprehensively better than Liverpool in winning 3-0, but at no point did you think they would lose. On the counter, United played with a conviction and edge that always suggested that, whatever happened in their own penalty box, they would manage to put it right in the other one. It was not dissimilar to the way Liverpool themselves felt at the back end of last season and look what it almost did for them. Wayne Rooney (centre)  celebrates scoring the opening goal against Liverpool as United head for victory . United weren’t comprehensively better than Liverpool in winning 3-0 but never looked like they would lose . BIG NAMES BACK LVG . As David Moyes discovered to his cost last season, a playing squad that isn’t fully behind its manager can quickly fall apart. Conversely, a less-than-perfect group of players can over-achieve if they are driven forwards by a close bond and a belief in what their coach is doing. This time last year, senior players at Old Trafford — such as Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic — already had serious reservations about Moyes and Ferguson’s successor suffered as a consequence. So far this time, Van Gaal has had no such problems and, crucially, he has quickly gained and maintained the trust and support of players such as Rooney, Michael Carrick and Darren Fletcher. Rooney and Van Gaal acknowledge each other during Sunday's 3-0 win over Liverpool . Players in the United dressing room listen to these voices and it is the Old Trafford squad’s belief in their coach that has, for example, enabled Antonio Valencia and Ashley Young to perform much better as emergency wing backs than anybody ever expected. These things can make a difference, especially during periods of transition. The decision to hand Rooney the captaincy was a clever one and it is paying off in terms of the England skipper’s performances and day-to-day influence. An example of Rooney’s current approach is that when Van Gaal called him back to the training ground from an appointment on Merseyside to talk about a forthcoming game a month ago, the 29-year-old didn’t bat an eyelid. Antonio Valencia (left) has performed much better as an emergency wing back than expected . Ashley Young (centre) is another wing back who has thrived under Van Gaal this year at Old Trafford . IGNORE THE CRITICS . Van Gaal has made mistakes since he arrived at United. He still seems confused about what system he wishes to play and he probably should have bought another central defender in the summer. Nevertheless, the Dutch coach has brought an authority and a conviction to the club that is already serving him well. United managers — just like their contemporaries at clubs like Spurs and Liverpool — will never be short of ex-coaches and players telling the world exactly what they are doing wrong. Van Gaal has had plenty of that, but those who know him stress that he doesn’t even hear it, never mind pay attention to it. Van Gaal can certainly get jumpy in press conferences and doesn’t like being reminded of things that have gone awry. But the key quality that the former Ajax, Barcelona and Bayern Munich coach possesses is to forget all about it as soon as he has walked out of the room. He is 100 per cent convinced that what he is doing is correct and that kind of self-belief is something you cannot buy. RIDE YOUR LUCK . United have had a dreadful run with injuries and only time will tell if any of that is down to Van Gaal’s methods. The United manager has been fortunate, however, that a tiny pocket of players he really needs have managed to stay fit. Rooney is certainly one of those — for many reasons — while David de Gea is another. The goalkeeper is on one of those runs of form that you can only dream about. His performances against Arsenal and Liverpool not only earned his team victories, but actually stopped them losing. Take six points off United’s tally of 31 in the Premier League and Van Gaal’s record would look identical to that of Moyes a year ago and would see them outside the top six with only two points more than Newcastle. That is how fine the margins are in English football these days. Van Gaal and his staff will rightly claim an influence on their goalkeeper’s form — coach Frans Hoek has previously worked with Victor Valdes, Pepe Reina and Edwin van der Sar — but if a keeper is saving your skin on a regular basis then it’s best to close your eyes and hope it continues. United goalkeeper David de Gea has been on one of those runs of form that you can only dream about . De Gea denies Raheem Sterling during United's 3-0 win over Liverpool at Old Trafford . De Gea has been saving United recently and has been Val Gaal's MVP in their last six Premier League wins . NO EUROPE . Despite the horrors of last season, perhaps the one big favour Moyes did for United before he left was ensure they didn’t qualify for the Europa League. United’s balance sheet may miss the income from regular European games but Van Gaal and his players should be grateful they don’t have the distraction. With the United squad creaking under the weight of injuries, one can only imagine what may have happened had they had Europa League commitments to cope with too. While we are on the subject, the 4-0 Capital One Cup defeat at MK Dons that seemed to spell crisis back in August no longer looks like the worst result in the world either. United’s constant stream of free weeks has given them vital breathing space so far. Van Gaal pictured during their 4-0 Capital One Cup defeat against MK Dons early in his reign . United players look embarrassed and gutted as MK Dons beat them 4-0 in the Capital One Cup . De Gea's form has certainly changed and United now look as if they could contend for the Premier League . TITLE CHANCES? So far they have not suggested they are good enough to lift the league title, especially when you consider the quality and depth of the two squads above them. United have dug very deep to find a good run of form and Van Gaal and his players deserve credit for that. However, it must be said that United’s performances in taking 18 points from games against Crystal Palace, Arsenal, Hull, Stoke, Southampton and Liverpool probably merited about half of that total on balance of play and opportunities. Good finishing and outstanding goalkeeping will only carry you so far and Van Gaal knows he still has issues to address in the days and weeks to come. His team struggle to keep possession for long periods and the defence — still missing some players — continues to look far too porous, particularly between the central defenders. It is worth noting that Moyes was still being asked if his team could win the title as United put together a six-game winning streak in all competitions this time last year. And look what happened to him. Van Gaal has started to come good at United with six Premier League wins on the trot .","Manchester United have won their last six Premier League matches .

This is the heartbreaking moment than an orphaned baby elephant mourns the death of her mother after she was killed by a poacher's poisoned spear for her ivory tusks . In the footage, the traumatised animal, named Roi, is seen standing over her mother's dead body in Kenya's Masai Mara National Park . The young female calf, who was visibly distressed, faced starvation without her mother's milk . In heart-wrenching scenes, the baby elephant looks lost as she waits to be rescued from the national park . Just 24 hours earlier, the endangered animals had been photographed playing happily together . The 10-month-old orphan temporarily joined another herd, but faced starvation without her own mother's milk. Luckily, Roi was later taken to safety after a dramatic rescue by wildlife experts. During the complex operation, the youngster was manoeuvred away from the herd, tranquillised and put on a plane. Roi was then taken to The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust Elephant Orphanage in Nairobi National Park, where trained keepers are now caring for her. Rob Brandford, UK Director of the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, said: 'Roi arrived in good health but was clearly traumatised from witnessing the death of her mother. 'She took milk from the keepers early but was wary and understandably a little nervous around her new surroundings, not trusting the keepers. Once she met the other orphans, she was immediately comfortable and content. Luckily, the distressed 10-month-old orphan - who faced starvation without her mother's milk - was dramatically rescued and taken to safety . In a complex operation, the youngster was manoeuvred away from the herd, tranquillised and put on a plane . This is the rescue operation which took place after Roi was left orphaned following her mother's death . 'The older elephants paid her attention and provided her with the love and affection she craved and missed. 'As the days have passed little Roi has settled in completely and is now extremely attached to her keepers, familiar with the routine and is playing once more - she is a confident little elephant.' Ivory poaching is a huge problem in Africa, killing one elephant every 15 minutes. The David Sheldrick Wilfdlife Trust is hoping to raise £15,000 to save more baby elephants like Roi who are orphaned by poaching. She joined a new herd after her mother's death but would have starved without her mother's milk . Roi was soon taken to The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust Elephant Orphanage in Nairobi National Park, where trained keepers are now caring for her . Mr Brandford said: 'Arriving as a fragile baby, Roi would not have survived without our intervention and she has now been afforded a second chance. 'We have 82 infant elephants reliant on us right now and we need to be ready to provide the same life-saving care for other orphaned elephants in need.'

"Tony Blair has said he will ‘never’ reveal the full truth about his relationship with Rupert Murdoch’s ex-wife. The former prime minister made headlines around the world last year following sensational allegations he had an affair with Wendi Deng, which prompted the billionaire media mogul to divorce her. Asked about the claims directly for the first time, Mr Blair refused to comment. Scroll down for video . Tony Blair (pictured right in 1998) says he will 'never' reveal the full truth about his relationship with Rupert Murdoch’s ex-wife, Wendi Deng (left) He told the Economist magazine the issue was ‘not something I will ever talk about – I haven’t and I won’t’. Leaked passages from Miss Deng’s diary revealed she described having ‘warm feelings’ comparable to a ‘crush’ on Mr Blair, who allegedly stayed at the Murdochs’ California ranch with her in October 2012 and April 2013 while the media mogul was abroad. In 2013, a spokesman for Mr Blair issued a statement saying: ‘If you are asking if they are having an affair, the answer is no.’ Mr Murdoch said this year he was 'shocked' by the claims about Miss Deng and Mr Blair, who is godfather to the couple’s daughter Grace . But the Economist said Mr Blair himself was much less forthcoming. In a lengthy profile of the former prime minister, the respected magazine says: ‘Mr Blair roundly denies any impropriety. Asked whether he was [at least] careless about his reputation, he says calmly that it is “not something I will ever talk about—I haven’t and I won’t”, and then bangs his coffee cup so loudly into its saucer that it spills and everyone in the room jumps. ‘But did he find himself in a tangle over his friendship with Ms Deng? A large, dark pool of sweat has suddenly appeared under his armpit, spreading across an expensive blue shirt. ‘Even Mr Blair’s close friends acknowledge that the saga damaged him — not least financially, since Mr Murdoch stopped contributing to Mr Blair’s faith foundation and cut him off from other friendly donors in America.’ Mr Blair and his wife Cherie also preside over a property empire comprising 10 flats and houses . Mr Murdoch said this year he was ‘shocked’ by the claims about Miss Deng and Mr Blair, who is godfather to the couple’s daughter Grace. He said he filed for divorce a week after staff at the ranch told him of their suspicions. 'Well, you know, everybody was talking about these things and never telling me anything... But then I was told two pretty circumstantial things about the ranch [where Deng had been staying],' Murdoch said in an interview with Forbes magazine . 'I was in Australia. When I got back, I naturally asked the staff, and it opened up. That's the story. And then, you know, a week later I filed. As soon as I could find a lawyer.' The couple divorced last November after 14 years of marriage. Details of lovestruck Deng's note, in which she praised Blair's 'good body,' his 'really, really good legs' and even his 'butt' were revealed by Vanity Fair in February. The Economist said: ‘According to sources at NewsCorp, Mr Murdoch pressed the “mute” button during a confrontational phone call, informed colleagues that he was getting “politicians’ answers” to his questions, and has never spoken to Mr Blair since.’ The new profile, headlined ‘The loneliness of Tony Blair’, paints a picture of a man who is able to command warmth and huge sums of money abroad while being ‘reviled’ in the country where he served as prime minister for 10 years. Mr Blair tells the magazine reports of his wealth have been greatly exaggerated – and suggests he has made no more than about £20 million since leaving office in 2007. The business arm of his operations, Tony Blair Associates, made £13 million last year. Mr Blair and his wife Cherie also preside over a family property empire comprising 10 flats and houses. But Mr Blair told the magazine that he ‘gives away as much as he has earned’, and that he has given away about £10 million. Mr Blair also defended his record in the Middle East. He said he would not ‘until my dying day’ admit that he was wrong to invade Iraq. ‘What annoys people is my refusal to change my mind,’ he says.","Affair allegations prompted Rupert Murdoch to divorce Wendi Deng .

"Edinson Cavani scored after just 57 seconds as Paris Saint-Germain beat Apoel Nicosia 1-0 in a scrappy game to reach the last 16 of the Champions League.

Subs Not Used: Chiotis, Artymatas, Alexandrou, Papazoglou. Att: 42, 000 . Ref: Olegario Benquerenca (Portugal). But the well-organised Cypriot side defended resolutely and PSG's performance became disjointed as the game wore on. PSG, unbeaten so far this season, has not lost at home in European competition since Nov. 2006 and tops Group F with 10 points - one more than Barcelona, who won 2-0 away to Ajax thanks to two goals from Argentina star Lionel Messi. Ibrahimovic is nursing a heel injury and hopes to be fit to face league leader Marseille on Sunday. Cavani started at center forward, flanked by Ezequiel Lavezzi and Javier Pastore. Having scored a last-gasp winner away to Apoel two weeks ago, it was the total opposite this time - with a well-taken effort signalling the Uruguay forward's return to form after some poor early-season performances. Full back Gregory van der Wiel broke down the right and picked out Cavani just inside the penalty area. With his back to goal, he flicked the ball up, spun and hit a firm shot that goalkeeper Urko Pardo fumbled, as the ball slipped through his fingers and rolled over the line. Apoel missed their only chance to level in the 12th minute when midfielder Nuno Morais whacked a shot high over the bar after goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu had beaten away a header from midfielder Vinicius. After a brief spell of neat possession football from Apoel, PSG tore up the field, again exposing the visitors' weak left flank.

Uruguayan striker Cavani dives through the air to head the ball while an aghast Apoel Nicosia player watches on . Pastore released Lucas after a quick one-two and, from his curling cross, Cavani rushed in to beat Pardo with a stooping header that bounced off the foot of the right post. The rebound fell to Lavezzi but, with Pastore getting in his way, he was unable to line up a shot. Lucas saw his angled shot skim just past the left post in the 27th after midfielder Blaise Matuidi picked him out with a cross from the left, and soon after Lucas left three defenders in his wake as he burst from midfield before forcing Pardo into a low save. Apoel looked lively at times going forward, only to lose possession too easily. From one failed attack, Pastore carved a hole in midfield and released Matuidi, who then touched the ball on to Cavani, bearing down from the right. But Cavani hesitated, decided against shooting, and then tried rounding Pardo, only to lose his footing and go to ground. With only 64 seconds played of the second half, Cavani almost repeated the his first-half trick but fluffed his shot from the near the penalty spot and, three minutes later, his curling effort from just inside the penalty area went wide of the upright. Lucas then tried jinking his way to goal, but got the ball tangled up in his feet after trying to beat a third defender, and the crowd's frustration was audible when Cavani hit a shot well over after Pastore's cut-back from the right.

Pastore had the next go, albeit a difficult chance, and saw his effort saved as he tried to dink the ball over Pardo from a tight angle. Cavani should have done much better with 10 minutes remaining, swiping a shot wide of the post from near the penalty and then substitute Jean-Christophe Bahebeck saw his shot charged down in the last minute.

Worse, after the first stream of putrid liquid, Mr Schmidt continues to squeeze, so it can only be assumed his very patient wife continued to be covered in the yellow pus. But he doesn't seem to worried. 'Wow, oh my God,' he is heard saying. 'It sprayed everywhere. I don't even know what to say right now.' Initially, his wife - dressed in an appropriate 'beginners luck' t-shirt - seems more worried about his phone, before taking a closer look at her arms. 'God, this is horrible,"" Mr Schmidt finally concedes, before adding: 'It's not done either. 'What is this thing?'

And finally, he manages to apologise to his wife, who is seen mopping the floor with a tissue. 'Sorry babe,' Mr Schmidt says. But remorse doesn't seem to last long. 'This is the greatest day of my life,' he says. This is the latest in a line of 'spot' videos which have both disgusted and enthralled the internet in recent months.

In the showpiece match of the evening, Van Gerwen was given a huge scare by his opponent Joe Cullen but eventually came through to win 3-1 and book his place in the second round. The Dutchman was below par in taking the opening two sets, but Cullen launched a spirited fightback to claim the third and make Van Gerwen sweat. Van Gerwen had to dig deep in the fourth set, which he won on a deciding leg to seal a hard-fought victory against the world No 44. After his victory, the world champion said: ‘He (Cullen) played well and put me under pressure, but a win is a win and I’m into the next round. ‘I didn’t play very well and I wasn’t consistent enough but that’s something to work around. I hit eight 180s but I made too many mistakes. ‘When he put me under pressure, my form was there straight away and that was a good sign for me. ‘The pressure wasn’t too bad, but I think I did quite well for the first game because the most important thing in the first round of the World Championship is winning.’ In the opening match of the tournament, world youth champion Keegan Brown survived a strong fightback from three-time world champion John Part. The 22-year-old from the Isle of Wight raced into a two-set lead against his Canadian opponent, winning the first seven legs of the match.

And, after missing his first three throws at double top to clinch the match, Brown returned to hit double 10 and seal his place in the second round. After his victory, Brown said: ‘I’ve got to juggle work and practicing now. ‘I will be going back to work on Monday morning as a lab assistant and be working on Christmas Day and Boxing Day as planned - then I’ll be back here a week on Sunday. ‘If someone told me that I was going to play against a former world champion in the first match on the opening night of the World Championships, I would have ripped their two arms and two legs off.

Jelle Klaasen was also a winner on opening night as he saw off Dutch compatriot Christian Kist 3-1.

But Klaasen responded by sweeping the fourth set to clinch victory and book his place in round two with an average of 96.97. He said: ‘I started well, but the problem I’ve had in the last few months is losing focus and I lost focus in the third set. But I’m happy with the way I played in the fourth set. ‘Two years ago I changed my throw and my darts I don’t have that much action with my throw now. I made it a little simpler and the first months few months I played rubbish. But the last six months I have been playing well and I feel I can win tournaments again.’ In the final match of the evening, Spanish qualifier Cristo Reyes upset Wes Newton to win in a final-leg shootout. Reyes won the opening two sets before Newton stormed back to level at 2-2 and force a deciding set. The fifth set went all the way down to a final leg with the players locked together at 5-5.

"Shocking new claims are being made about June 'Mama June' Shannon and her estranged husband Mike 'Sugar Bear' Thompson in a new interview. In an interview with the National Enquirer, Lee 'Uncle Poodle' Thompson claims that his brother, Sugar Bear, June, and Sugar Bear's older brother Billy had a 'threesome.' What's more, Uncle Poodle even shared text messages he had with June talking about the incident. Scroll down for video . Shocking report: A new interview claims that June 'Mama June' Shannon and her estranged husband Mike 'Sugar Bear' Thompson had a threesome with his brother . Source: These claims are being made by Lee 'Uncle Poodle' Thompson, June's brother-in-law and Sugar Bear's brother . Third: The other man in the threesome was Billy (above with June's daughter), Sugar Bear's brother . 'June said all of the kids were out of the house and Billy came over to visit them,' Uncle Poodle told the Enquirer. 'Billy happened to see her in her undergarments. He then told June, ""If you are dressed like that when I get back, I'm going to have sex with you.""' Poodle then says that when Billy came back June was 'naked in bed and they ended up having a threesome.' When asked about the incident, Billy said he 'couldn't remember.' Then, over the weekend, Poodle posted  text message exchange he had with June in which she reportedly writes to him; 'IM GOING TO CONFRONT EVERYONE ON EVERYTHING BCYES YOU HAVE STARTED SOME LIES.' She then reportedly goes on to write; 'OH AND YEAH YOUR FAKE DATE WITH NATIONAL ENQUIOR WHEN YOU TOLD HIM ABOUT ME BILLY AND SUGAR BEAR IT'S OKAY BC THAT IS MY PAST.' Mama June has not responded officially to these claims, and Uncle Poodle is not backing down. 'I would be more than happy to take another polygraph test (based) on what June told me,' he said. 'If she denies it.' This all comes as Mama June's annual toy drive has taken a massive hit after she was accused of getting back together with her sex offender ex Mark McDaniel. Her popular reality show, Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, was cancelled by TLC after photos emerged of her with the convicted child molester and youngest daughter Alana Thompson. What's mire, June's oldest daughter, Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell, recently came forwards and said that McDaniel repeatedly abused her when she was just a child.

"Budget cuts at the IRS could delay tax refunds, reduce taxpayer services and hurt enforcement efforts, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen said Thursday. About half the people who call the IRS for assistance this filing season won't be able to get through to a person, Koskinen said. Once tax returns are filed, there will be fewer agents to audit them. 'Everybody's return will get processed,' Koskinen told reporters. 'But people have gotten very used to being able to file their return and quickly getting a refund.' 'This year we may not have the resources, the people to provide refunds as quickly as we have in the past.' IRS Commissioner John Koskinen, shown during a July 23 congressional hearing, said budget cuts could delay tax refunds, but also allowed that fewer audits would be performed . REVENGE? House Speaker John Boehner (left) and incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (right) worked in their respective chambers to craft a budget and get it to President Obama in time to avoid a government shutdown – and the IRS, whose muscle will be needed to enforce the unpopular Obamacare law, was one agency to see its ox gored in the process . In recent years, the IRS says it was able to issue most tax refunds within 21 days, if the returns were filed electronically. Koskinen wouldn't estimate how long they might be delayed in the upcoming filing season, which is just a few weeks away. Congress cut the IRS budget by $346 million for the budget year that ends in September 2015. The $10.9 billion budget is $1.2 billion less than the agency received in 2010. The cuts come as the IRS is starting to play a bigger role in implementing President Barack Obama's health care law. For the first time, taxpayers will have to report on their tax returns whether they have health insurance. Millions of taxpayers who are receiving tax credits to help pay insurance premiums will have to report them as well. Some Republicans in Congress have vowed to cut IRS funding as a way to hurt implementation of the health care law. Koskinen has said it won't work. He said the IRS is required to enforce the law, so other areas will have to be cut, including taxpayer services and enforcement. Kosinen said the IRS is imposing a hiring freeze, except for emergencies, and is eliminating almost all overtime. 'In some ways, these budget cuts are really a tax cut for tax cheats,' Koskinen said. 'Because to the extent we have fewer people to audit and enforce the tax code, that means some people cutting corners on their taxes or not complying are going to get away with it, and that is a decision that Congress has made.' The National Treasury Employees Union represents IRS workers. Union President Colleen M. Kelley said waits at IRS walk-in centers will stretch for hours and 'correspondence will continue to pile up and taxpayers will wait longer and longer for a response.' 'Starving the IRS hurts more than just the agency's workforce, it hurts all taxpayers,' Kelley said. HOLDING THE BAG: Obama insisted on a comprehensive budget by a mid-deadline, but that meant spending in some areas had to be compensated with cuts in others – including the hated IRS . Koskinen called Thursday's news conference to highlight tips for choosing a qualified tax preparer. He said it is important to check preparers' qualifications and work history, confirm their fees and always review the tax return before signing it. He said taxpayers should be wary of preparers who promise big refunds. The tax filing season generally starts in mid-January, though it has been delayed in recent years because of last-minute tax changes enacted by Congress. Once again, Congress passed a tax bill this year just before going home for the holidays, extending more than 50 temporary tax breaks that had expired. Koskinen, however, said the filing season would start on time next month, though he said the agency was not yet ready to announce the exact date. Each year, millions of taxpayers file their returns in the first few weeks of the filing season so they can get fast refunds. This year, refunds averaged about $2,800.","Congress cut the Internal Revenue Service's allowance by $346 million for the budget year that ends in September 2015 .

"Michael Carrick says he will always class himself as a midfielder despite being called upon to shore up Manchester United’s defence. The 33-year-old is highly regarded by manager Louis van Gaal and has been trusted to play as an auxiliary centre-back and  has cut an accomplished figure. ‘I class myself as a midfielder and probably always will,’ said Carrick. ‘I might have spells at centre-back, as I have over the last few years, but I’ve played for that long in midfield that I can’t class myself as anything other than a midfielder.’ Michael Carrick (left) has impressed playing out of position in defence for Manchester United recently .

Carrick has helped Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal lead his team to six consecutive wins . However, as Marcos Rojo and Chris Smalling are both still injured, Carrick may continue in defence for Saturday’s visit to Aston Villa. ‘You have to adapt because that’s just how things have gone in recent weeks,’ said Carrick. ‘Maybe when the injuries settle down and we have more of a settled squad then it will be more consistent in terms of positioning. But you have to be ready to deal with injuries. It’s happened a few times this season and, the more it does, the easier it gets.’ Carrick missed the first three months of the season after undergoing ankle surgery in July but since his comeback, United have lost once to Manchester City and won six successive games. Talking to United Review and Inside United, Carrick said: ‘I feel good and I feel fresh. Obviously I missed a lot of football at the start of the season, but I’m enjoying it. ‘When you’re out for so long you really miss it, so I am just happy to be back playing and looking forward to the games ahead.

It is the work he does that doesn’t get noticed, things like carrying the ball up the pitch for 30 or 40 yards when you have been defending. ‘He takes you up the pitch and defenders just back up because they know about his pace. If he can go down the line, then he is pretty hard to catch. He is a great team player and, when you are playing with him, you certainly appreciate that he is on your team. ‘He is pretty much the full package,’ added Carrick. ‘He is reserved but determined at the same time. He is quiet, he is pleasant and he is polite. He is not somebody who shouts and screams in the changing room but I certainly wouldn’t want to get on the wrong side of him. ‘He is stubborn and determined.

'If we tried to replace Peter Crouch it would be very difficult for us and it would be a significant outlay so it’s in our own interests to try and re-contract him if we can,' said Hughes. ‘He is a big part of what we do here. His age isn’t an issue in my view because he’s a player whose strengths aren’t based on pace but his other attributes are likely to remain with him for any number of seasons after this one. 'Where he is in his career is still a good place and he’s an important player for us. There have been contract discussions already and I think peoples’ minds can concentrate on contracts and players in January so we will start the process.’ The strike against Palace was Crouch's fifth goal of the season in all competitions . Stoke goalscorer Crouch acknowledges the travelling away support after the final whistle . On Whelan, Hughes added: 'There is something on the table for Glenn and was early on in the season, there have been more discussions about that. There are any number of players that their situation is fluid, we just have to make sure Stoke City as a club are strengthened and strong. 'That means we don’t let anybody leave even if there’s a real interest or situations that might develop. It’s about making sure we are strong as a club.

"Champions League top scorer Luiz Adriano scored a hat-trick as Shakhtar Donetsk cruised to a 5-0 victory over 10-man BATE Borisov. Luiz Adriano's second-half triple took him to nine Champions League goals this season, five of which he scored in a 7-0 rout of BATE last month. Playing in Lviv, 640 miles from Donetsk, due to the Ukrainian conflict, Shakhtar took the lead on 19 minutes when captain Darijo Srna fired in off a cushioned pass from Luiz Adriano, who also assisted Alex Teixeira's 48th-minute goal. Luiz Adriano scored a hat-trick against BATE, he previously scored five goals against them . Shakhtar Donetsk have scored 12 goals against BATE in their two Champions League group games . BATE right-back Anri Khagush was sent off after the half time whistle had gone, earning a second yellow card in less than a minute for arguing with the referee. Shakhtar is second in Group H behind Porto, with BATE third. Sporting Lisbon beat Schalke 4-2  to keep alive its hopes of advancing to the competition's knock-out round. Sporting's first win of the tournament this season lifted it to four points in Group G, with German side Schalke on five. With two games to play, Chelsea lead the group with eight points and Maribor have three. On-loan Manchester United winger Nani scores Sporting's third goal of the evening against Schalke . After a slow start in Portugal Nani is starting to become an influential figure for the club . Islam Slimani's 17th-minute own goal handed Schalke the lead but Sporting equalised just under 10 minutes later through Naby Sarr's glancing header. Jefferson put Sporting in front with a low drive in the 52nd, and Nani made it 3-1 in the 72nd. It is the winger's fifth goal since he returned to Sporting on a season-long loan from Manchester United earlier in the summer. The 27-year-old seems to be thriving back in Portugal and showing the kind of form that convinced Sir Alex Ferguson to spend £16million on him in 2007. Whether he will ever play for United again remains to be seen but his current form is surely catching eye. Dennis Aogo pulled one back two minutes from the end before Slimani sealed it on the break as Schalke pushed forward.

Brahimi's exquisite solo effort set up Jackson Martinez to score in the 56th minute and make amends for the striker's missed penalty kick during a first-half that Porto was unfortunate to finish without a goal. Bilbao striker Guillermo Fernandez had one of the hosts' few scoring chances with an awkward header that hit the post in the 70th. But three minutes later a gaffe by goalkeeper Gorka Iraizoz gifted Brahimi his goal. Porto rose to 10 points in Group H, while Bilbao was left in last place with one point and without hope for advancing.","Shakhtar Donetsk beat BATE Borisov 5-0, Luiz Adriano scored three goals .

"President Obama raised some eyebrows Wednesday when he was overheard saying that he is Jewish in his soul during a Hanukkah celebration at the White House. The revelation was made by David Suissa, of the Jewish Journal, who was invited to the reception at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue attended by about 550 Jewish leaders, journalists and dignitaries, including Gwyneth Paltrow. The president took part in the Menorah-lighting ceremony and delivered a well-received speech about freedom, peppered with light-hearted jokes about Jewish food. Scroll down for video . Festival of Lights: President Obama, who is Christian, surprised guests at Wednesday's Hanukkah celebration at the White House by saying that he is Jewish in his soul . With the formal part of the event over, Obama was mingling with his guests when one of them caught his attention and told him in a booming voice: 'Mr President, when I told my Christian friend I was coming to a Hanukah party at the White House, he told me, “I didn't know the president was Jewish!""' Suissa, who was standing nearby, wrote that Obama responded to the guest's quip with a ‘serious belly laugh.’ After three or four seconds, as he was walking away from the crowd, Obama responded: '“I am [Jewish], in my soul.""' The celebration of the Jewish high holy day coincided with the release of Jewish-American Alan Gross from a Cuban prison after five years in captivity. ‘I’m told that in the Jewish tradition, one of the great mitzvahs is ""pidyon shvuyim,”’ Obama said in his remarks, drawing applause from the audience. ‘My Hebrew is not perfect, but I get points for trying. But it describes the redemption, the freeing, of captives. And that’s what we’re celebrating today, because after being unjustly held in Cuba for more than five years, American Alan Gross is free.’ Image problem: Obama has been widely criticized over the past six weeks for not being as unconditionally supportive of the State of Israel as his predecessors . The bold statement from the president, who is known to be a practicing Christian, might come as a surprise to some in the Jewish community.

"Sam Allardyce has criticised the Football Association for punishing Nigel Pearson over his explosive altercation with a fan – and blamed the security at Leicester's King Power Stadium. A video emerged of Pearson telling one of his own fans to 'fuck off and die' during their 3-1 defeat by Liverpool at the start of December. The Leicester manager has since accepted an FA charge of using 'abusive and/or insulting words towards a spectator,' but Allardyce, whose West Ham side host Pearson's team on Saturday, considers the punishment unfair. The FA were wrong to punish Nigel Pearson over his row with a fan, according to Sam Allardyce . Allardyce claimed Pearson was let down by security inside the King Power Stadium . 'I think that it depends on what position you’re in at that moment in particular time and if somebody has baited you as much as that fella did then if you get a reaction, you get a reaction,' Allardyce said. 'We’re all human beings aren’t we? When you lose your rag, what do you do? Do you stay calm? No. 'We cannot be angels all the time in this badly politically correct world we have. This politically correct world drives you up the wall. We’ll be shutting the door too hard soon. 'I think [the FA charge] is wrong, personally. He should get a warning about his future conduct, because he hasn't stepped out of line before. But the FA are just as scared as everyone else about being PC.' Allardyce admitted he has had altercations with fans in the past that were not caught on camera, but declined to elaborate further on them. The 60-year-old worked with Pearson for seven months at Newcastle, keeping him on as a coach when he took over at the club in 2007. West Ham manager Allardyce said that he too had had confrontations with supporters during his career . Pearson worked as a coach under Allardyce back in 2007 when the latter was Newcastle manager . The Foxes have not won a Premier League match since their surprise 5-3 win against Manchester United . Allarcye added: 'It’s up the clubs and the security system at the football club. I think Leicester’s security let Nigel down because this lad was baiting him all the time so they should have gone over, nipped him by the collar and pushed him out and said don’t bother coming back here. 'It’s what Manchester United have been doing for years to stop anything like that happening. Fans are fans, up to a point. If a manager turned around pointed to a policeman and said, “Look, this guy’s doing this, I want you to arrest him”, that will cause mayhem. 'Club security should look at that situation around where they dugout is and if somebody’s being particularly, constantly verbally aggressive then the security should take the fan away and say it’s not an acceptable behaviour.'","Nigel Pearson was punished by The FA after his row with a fan .

"This time last year, all was well at Anfield. Liverpool were a point ahead of Manchester City at the top of the Barclays Premier League and Brendan Rodgers was looking good for the manager of the year award. Steven Gerrard was on his game, feeding Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge with those measured passes through midfield. But the landscape has changed drastically as Liverpool prepare to face Arsenal at home on Sunday. ‘Everyone knows if we perform the way we have done of late against Arsenal we’ll get beaten,’ admitted Gerrard. ‘When you have a strikeforce of Daniel Sturridge and Luis Suarez, they are capable of killing teams in 20 minutes. It’s different this year and everyone knows that.’ Steven Gerrard has said Liverpool must improve if they want to get anything from this season . Gerrard congratulates Raheem Sterling after the midfielder scores the opening goal against Bournemouth . Liverpool lie in 11th place, 18 points behind leaders Chelsea, who they have been drawn to face in the Capital One Cup semi-final. Even in the moments after Liverpool reached the last four with a 3-1 win at Bournemouth on Wednesday night, captain Gerrard was on hand for a rather brutal reality check. Last season they blew Arsenal away at Anfield, scoring four times in the opening 20 minutes and eventually winning 5-1. This is a different Liverpool team, still adapting to life without Suarez and the injured Sturridge, who has been forced to go to Boston for treatment on his troublesome thigh injury. ‘I think they were 60-70 per cent of our goals those two. You take them out of any team in the world and it’s going to be tough and it has been,’ said Gerrard. ‘But I think this is where you find out what kind of players you’ve got in the dressing room. It’s time to roll your sleeves up and fight for the club and try to put it right as soon as possible and that’s what we’re trying to do. Gerrard lamented the loss of forwards Luis Suarez to Barcelona and Daniel Sturridge to injury . Liverpool are currently 11th in the Premier League, five points behind Sunday's opponents Arsenal . Liverpool slumped to a 3-0 defeat against Manchester United in their last Premier League outing . ‘We made mistakes against Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday and we got punished by world-class players,’ he added. ‘The first half against Bournemouth was probably as close as we’ve come to last season’s standards. ‘It’s been tough to perform of late because we haven’t played well as a team, but if we keep giving everything we’ve got then I’m sure the good days are not too far away. ‘If we can get a big result against Arsenal and build on this, then I think we can turn it around.’ Gerrard does not agree that they have turned the corner after beating a Championship team. The pressure is still on and so it should be after seven league defeats and an unnecessary exit in the group stage of the Champions League. The scrutiny has been intense and Gerrard accused people of ‘killing’ the club during a wretched run. He made it clear that the criticism of his own performances hurts him, but accepts that is the life as a player or manager at one of the world’s biggest clubs. Gerrard said it was important that players didn't hide on the pitch, saying they needed 'men out there' Liverpool's captain claimed a win against Arsenal on Sunday could help turn their season around . Brendan Rodgers has to accept criticism will come his way as manager of Liverpool, says Gerrard . ‘It comes with the territory,’ he said. ‘There was a stage when a couple of my performances were under par and I got a bit of stick. It’s normal. I’ve got to accept it being captain of the club and Brendan’s got to accept it being the manager of Liverpool. ‘If results don’t go well, questions are going to be asked, criticism is going to fly, you take it on the chin and try to improve things. That’s the only way. I know when I don’t play well. I think every individual does, but collectively it has been tough. ‘For me I’ve experienced it a few times during my career at Liverpool when it gets tough under certain managers and from the outside people are trying to kill you. It’s normal. We’re at a big club, we’ve got to take that responsibility. We can’t have players hiding, we need men out there.’ Simon Mignolet has lost his place in the Liverpool side following a number of high-profile mistakes . Liverpool's win against Bournemouth was their first victory since they beat Leicester on December 2 . Gerrard with manager Rodgers, who has been heavily criticised of late for his team's performances . In many ways this was Gerrard at his best, rallying the team and reminding them publicly of their responsibilities to the club. But with Liverpool seven points behind West Ham in fourth place, Champions League qualification appears a tall order for this team. Gerrard said: ‘It’s a tough question and it’s going to be tough to do it. We knew it was going to be tough the moment we lost Luis and the injuries we’ve had to Daniel of late. Everyone in the country knows the job to get in the top four becomes that awful lot harder. But we’ll keep fighting until the end and if people are going to write us off, we can’t control it. ‘I tell players individually and I tell them in the dressing room. But if you’re sitting in that dressing room and you don’t know that the performance levels haven’t been good enough of late, you’re at the wrong place. ‘All I can control is what goes on in the dressing room and try to help other players to perform well. But certainly, on the performance against Bournemouth, there’s still a chance.’","Liverpool face Arsenal at Anfield on Sunday .

First sighting in 150 years: A young, healthy cougar found stuck in a tree in Kentucky was shot and killed Monday (file photo) 'It seemed to be in very healthy condition, and they determined pretty quickly that it didn't look like it had traveled long distances on foot,' agency spokesman Mark Marraccini said. Marraccini says the lion was killed because it was roaming free near a populated area, making it a public safety issue. 'If that cat had left that tree, it would have disappeared into the brush and it was a fairly populated area,' Marraccini told the Courier-Journal. 'I don't see any reason why it shouldn't be handled that way.' He said if the mountain lion was a wild animal, it apparently would be the first one confirmed in Kentucky since before the Civil War. 'But that is a pretty big if,'' he said. 'They took some measurements today, but that's certainly not enough to go on without looking at everything in total.' 'Dispatch it': The animal was treed by a dog in northern Bourbon before a wildlife official chose to 'dispatch it' out of public safety concerns . Amy Rodrigues, a staff biologist for the Mountain Lion Foundation, disagrees with Marraccini's assessment. 'If you're a deer, they're a little dangerous. If you're a human, not so much,' she told the Courier-Journal. 'Attacks on people are not that common. There have only been 22 deaths in the last 120 years.' The animal's DNA will be sent to an out-of-state wildlife lab to determine whether its genetic material matches any wild populaitons. 'They can determine the origin,' Marraccini said, though it won't be fast. He said it could take weeks to get an answer. Mountain lions, which also are known as cougars and panthers, are the largest cats found in North America. They were once native to the area but are most relegated to western states. They are now believed to number around 30,000 in North America.","A Fish and Wildlife official near Paris, Kentucky responded to the call about a young male mountain lion in a tree and though it best to 'dispatch it'

"Quentin Letts tried six  versions of the Christmas pudding from different supermarkets . For many of us it is — along with the Queen’s television address at 3pm — the defining moment of Christmas Day: the arrival of the pudding! At a signal from the kitchen, everyone round the dining table falls silent. The dog whimpers and takes cover. Dad pours the heated brandy. Lights a match. Whoosh. Shades of napalm in the Vietnam war as the brandy catches fire and Mum asks a black-faced Dad: ‘Do you think you poured too much, dear?’ But seriously, here she comes, folks, here comes the great, black beauty of a pudding, a flaming, round mound of dark deliciousness with a sprig of (now rather singed-looking) holly protruding from its summit and dollops of brandy butter just waiting to melt down its flank. Yum yum yum. Or, quite often, yuck, particularly from younger members of my family. They groaned when I told them we were to ‘test-drive’ Christmas puds from six of the big supermarkets. ‘But I HATE Christmas pudding,’ wailed Honor, 11. She soon changed her mind when I mentioned that anyone trying the puddings could have a small glass of pudding wine, a pleasing Jurancon. Honor likes pudding wine. She relented and joined our pudding panel. I always loved Christmas pud as a child — and I still do. Perhaps that tells you I am a natural gourmand, or perhaps it started thanks to financial greed — our Christmas puds always had sixpences hidden in them. Ah, the good old days before decimalisation. My own children, particularly the girls, have been slower to appreciate the annual ‘treat’ of sultanas, raisins, currants, nuts, orange peel and so forth. But maybe we were buying the wrong sort. Maybe we could find a supermarket pudding that would convert them. Actually, for the past couple of years I have made my own Christmas puds, and I thought they were fantastic: oozing wetness with fat from the suet. We did the proper thing of making them on ‘Stir-Up Sunday’ just before Advent and adding interesting pieces of dried fruit, sloshings of brandy, all stiffened with breadcrumbs and given some colour with liquid Camp Coffee. Our mission for the Mail, however, was to try supermarket puddings. We bought roughly the same size puds (450g or about 1lb, enough to serve four) from Messrs Morrisons, Sainsbury’s, Waitrose, the Co-op, Tesco and Aldi. Prices ranged from £2.50 (Morrisons) to £4 (Tesco), but we cheated slightly on the latter because Tesco had an offer on its ‘Finest’ line, and we thought we would be extravagant. Scroll down for video . The top of the puds was Waitrose's 'richly fruited' Christmas pudding, according to the Letts family . In second place, the Co-op's offering was 'nice and alcoholic' and 'a good all-rounder' (pictured) After all, it had been stewed in Courvoisier cognac for nine months and had some flowery description on the box about how it had been made by ‘specialists who have been making Christmas puddings for 100 years’. It promised to be a ‘wonderfully rich, moist pudding’. Tesco was not the only supermarket that had employed wordsmiths. Aldi described its pud as ‘richly decadent’ (decadence at £2.99!) while the Co-op’s had been ‘matured for six months’. That’s longer than many a prison sentence these days. My tasting panel was: my mother Jocelyn, 80; my wife Lois; and children Claud, 17, Eveleen, 16, and the reluctant Honor. I should declare now that I sometimes write theatre reviews for a Waitrose magazine but this was a blind tasting, conducted to standards of impartiality that would not disgrace the Electoral Commission itself. I cooked the puddings in a microwave borrowed specially for the occasion — I normally avoid such machines, but the prospect of steaming six puddings in a bain marie for one-and-a-half hours each was unappealing. Sainsbury's pudding - which came third -was laced with cider (left) while Tesco's pudding was 'dry' (right) Three minutes of microwaving did the trick — ping! — though by the end of the process the kitchen did smell faintly of burnt plastic. Not quite the desired effect, really. First out of the traps was Morrisons’ ‘rich, mixed fruit pudding with cider and rum’, a steal at £2.50. It plopped from its container looking dark and just a little sinister. Was this a Christmas pud or a lump of lava from the slopes of Etna? More than one of the panel thought it was rubbery. ‘Sticky and boring,’ said Honor. ‘Dry,’ thought Claud, reaching for some pudding wine. ‘Wouldn’t cross the road for it,’ said Lois. Eveleen pulled a face. Oh dear. Next! Enter Sainsbury’s Christmas pudding, £3. It glistened pleasingly when it emerged from its container. Everyone took a teaspoonful. This one was laced with cider and that certainly found favour with the 17-year-old boy. Looking at the label I noticed it had the ‘V’ sign meaning ‘suitable for veggies’. Palm oil had been used instead of proper suet. And so, as we looked at the ingredients labels, did it prove for all the puds. Not a single one used animal suet. Vegetarians will see this as progress, but I am not convinced the culinary gods will be so pleased. Morrison's was 'sticky and boring' with Quentin's wife saying she 'wouldn't cross the road for it' Disaster struck with pudding number three, which was Waitrose’s ‘richly fruited’ offering at £3.75. When I turned the container I did not quite do so quickly enough. The pudding, which was juicier than its rivals, slid out at an angle — whoaa! — and disintegrated when I tried to put it upright with a metal spatula. It looked like a pile of rubble after a landslide. Image is not everything, however, and this one was the first to meet with ‘mmmns’ and ‘ahhhs’ of approval from our panel as it slid down the hatch. It tasted expensive and quite nutty. Lois liked the ‘toffeeish, chewy bits’. Claud said it was ‘more fruity’. ‘Different,’ thought Honor, and for the first time she was not making pretend-gagging gestures at her throat. We had a hit of sorts on our hands at last. Could the Co-op Christmas pudding at £3 match the Waitrose landslide? It certainly held together better, but I think the Waitrose collapse was basically down to cook’s incompetence. ‘More boozy than the first three,’ thought Jocelyn. ‘Nice and alcoholic,’ said a smiling 11-year-old. ‘Good all-rounder,’ said Lois. Our waistlines fast expanding (even vegetarian Christmas pudding is not slimming, my dears), we turned to our fifth candidate, Tesco’s Christmas pudding with Courvoisier cognac, English cider, amontillado sherry, French brandy, ruby port and brandy-soaked cherries. All for £4. Hic! This was certainly the booziest of the puds. Perhaps Tesco’s chefs were trying to improve morale at their company after recent profit warnings. Bottom of the pudding pile: Aldi's offering was 'spectacularly disgusting', according to Quentin Letts . My wife had to go and play at a Christingle church service after our tasting session and confessed to the vicar that she was ‘drunk in charge of an organ’. She blamed the Tesco pud, but the Jurancon may also have been responsible. The Tesco offering had a springy texture (‘dry’, grumbled Jocelyn and Claud) and was paler in colour than some. Honor thought it ‘hard to get into’, which made it sound like the Garrick Club. Both she and her sister said the amount of booze was ‘overpowering’. One for adults’ palates, perhaps. Finally, we approached the Aldi Christmas pudding, £2.99. It is always bad luck to go last, perhaps, but I thought this was easily the nastiest of the lot. It seemed to taste chiefly of plastic. What do you get a cookbook addict for Christmas? If they’ve already got Jamie, Nigella, Delia and Gordon, and they’re short on space, Penguin has the perfect present. Cookery Postcards From Penguin is a box of 100 cards reproducing classic covers from the publisher’s archives. Some of the titles are a hoot: there’s the Cookery For Men Only book with an image of a hapless man chopping a carrot with a pair of scissors, and The Reluctant Cook, which shows a stereotypical 1950s housewife lying on the sofa, smoking a cigarette and drinking a cocktail while ignoring the dinner sizzling on the hob. Elsewhere, be grateful we are past the post-War days of Ambrose Heath’s Good Dishes From Tinned Foods. ‘Scented,’ said Jocelyn. ‘Plasticky,’ declared Honor. Eveleen quite liked it. So did our Patterdale terrier, Bonnie. She had most of my spoonful. It had the texture of melted lorry tyre. Really spectacularly disgusting, in my opinion. The only way I could get rid of the taste was to have a clementine from a big box we bought from Aldi at the same time as we bought the pud. Our judges’ verdict, in ascending order (i.e., starting with the worst) was: Aldi, Morrisons, Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Co-op, Waitrose. The last three were certainly worth their place on your Christmas table, but I would still place my home-made puds in a higher class. These, you see, are properly sinful: they are made with real suet. And come the day itself, my daughters agree, they will try my proper pud — provided they can wash it down with some more Jurancon.","Waitrose won the taste test for the best supermarket Christmas pudding .

"A massive security flaw that could let hackers listen in on private calls and read text messages has been revealed. The flaw, is in a global telecom network called Signal System 7 that helps phone carriers across the world, including AT&T and Verizon, route calls and texts. The flaws, to be reported at a hacker conference in Hamburg this month, are the latest in a string of major flaws in the system. The flaws are in a system called SS7, the global network that allows the world's cellular carriers to route calls, texts and other services to each other . The flaws discovered by the German researchers are actually functions built into SS7 for other purposes – such as keeping calls connected as users speed down highways, switching from cell tower to cell tower. However, hackers worked out a way to  repurpose the features for surveillance because of the lax security on the network. 'Experts say it's increasingly clear that SS7, first designed in the 1980s, is riddled with serious vulnerabilities that undermine the privacy of the world's billions of cellular customers,' said The Washington Post, which first uncovered flaws in the system earlier this year. The flaws discovered by the German researchers are actually functions built into SS7 for other purposes – such as keeping calls connected as users speed down highways, switching from cell tower to cell tower. However, hackers worked out a way to  repurpose the features for surveillance because of the lax security on the network. Although the extent of the flaws has not yet been revealed, it is believed hackers can locate callers anywhere in the world, listen to calls as they happen or record hundreds of encrypted calls and texts at a time for later decryption. 'It's like you secure the front door of the house, but the back door is wide open,' Tobias Engel, one of the German researchers, told the Post. There also is potential to defraud users and cellular carriers by using SS7 functions, the researchers say. The The American Civil Liberties Union has even warned people against using their handset in light of the breaches. 'Don't use the telephone service provided by the phone company for voice,' principle technologist Christopher Soghoian told Gizmodo. Hackers worked out a way to repurpose the features networks use to connect calls for surveillance because of the lax security on the network. The voice channel they offer is not secure. 'You can use FaceTime, which is built into any iPhone, or Signal, which you can download from the app store. 'These allow you to have secure communication on an insecure channel.' He also believes that security agencies could be using the flaws. 'Many of the big intelligence agencies probably have teams that do nothing but SS7 research and exploitation. 'They've likely sat on these things and quietly exploited them.'","Flaws set to be reported at a hacker conference in Hamburg this month .

"FA chairman Greg Dyke will continue to be hounded by FIFA for the return of his £16,000 Parmigiani watch despite the resignation of ethics investigator Michael Garcia, who had pursued him over the matter. FIFA sources have indicated Dyke is believed to be the only one of the 65 international delegates at the FIFA Congress in Sao Paulo in the summer who received watches from the Brazilian Football Federation not to have returned it to Zurich after Garcia ruled the cost of the gifts breached the ethics code.

"What do Kylie Minogue and the can-can girls at the Moulin Rouge have in common? They all get their dancing shoes from Maison Clairvoy, the Parisian bootmaker that has cornered the market for top end, made-to-measure footwear for screen and stage. Founded in 1945, the Maison Clairvoy still operates from the shop where it all began - a small building at 17 Rue Fontaine, just 650ft from the Moulin Rouge itself. Despite its theatrical clientele, the atelier began life as a simple shoe shop, with founder Edouard Adabachian creating bespoke footwear on demand for private clients. Ready for action: A dancer from the Moulin Rouge shows off her calf-length Maison Clairvoy boots while stretching ahead of a performance . Looking good: A pair of dancers show off their custom-made pink boots created by Maison Clairvoy, which come complete with elaborate silver leatherwork . Ready to dance: A dancer from the Moulin Rouge adjusts the ankle strap on her delicate gold heels and right, a dancer uses the wall as a leg stretching aid . By the 1960s, Maison Clairvoy had branched out into creating shoes for the theatrical world and today, theatre, cinema and even circuses account for 80 percent of the 400 pairs of shoes and boots the company makes every year. Abadachian's descendants sold the business to Moulin Rouge in 2006 but little has changed otherwise. The shop is still half boutique and half theatre museum, with signed pictures of famous performers and a can-can costume permanently on display. On the floor, a smooth red carpet evokes the world of cabaret.  'That is where tap dancers test the shoes,' explains bootmaker Nicolas Maistriaux, the current director of Maison Clairvoy. According to the 35-year-old, the job of creating the shoes is a delicate one and the atelier employs five expert cobblers to create them. 'There . are about 250 steps in the production of each shoe,' he explains. 'And a pair can involve anything between 20 and 60 . hours of work.' The Moulin Rouge takeover has ensured the company's future by guaranteeing a steady flow of orders, Maistriaux adds. As a result, some of their top-selling styles are the calf-length, blue and red mini-boots in which the can-can is  performed. Beautiful: . The shoes at Maison Clairvoy take between 20 and 60 hours to make and . as a result, cost between £1,200 and £2,800 per pair . Man of the moment: Nicolas Maistriaux photographed in the workshop of the Maison Clairvoy, where he is creative director . In the window: A selection of custom-made shoes on display in the window of Maison Clairvoy which is located just 650ft from the iconic Moulin Rouge . Thanks to Clairvoy's attention to detail, dancers can thump the stage floor repeatedly in confidence: the heels are specially designed to spread and absorb the shocks. 'Stage shoes have to be extremely high-quality, both from a technical and an aesthetic point of view,' says Maistriaux. The laces on the can-can boots are only there to enhance leg length: a zip on the outside of the boot actually does the job of keeping the dancers' ankles fully supported. But while Maison Clairvoy still supplies shoes to the Moulin Rouge, it regularly makes shoes to order for film-makers as well. Recent examples have included the high heels that featured in French-Belgian production Guillaume et les garçons à table, or, as it's known in English, Me, myself and Mum,  and the Roman-era footwear sported by Gallic cartoon heroes Asterix and Obelix. Jean Dujardin, the Oscar-nominated star of silent film, The Artist, is another client and slipped into a pair of spurred Clairvoy boots for the cinema adaptation of another cartoon strip, Lucky Luke. Delicate: A Moulin Rouge dancer shows off her pretty beige and gold leather strappy shoes . Stunning: One of the custom made shoes created at Maison Clairvoy.

Handmade: Gonin painstakingly hand-stitches the leather upper on a pair of boots he is making for a dancer at the Moulin Rouge . 'We modified the interior of the boot to make it easier for the actor to appear bow-legged like Luke,' reveals Maistriaux. Kylie Minogue turned to the company for her 2006 and 2008 tours, with the diminutive pop star requesting shoes with four-inch heels she could dance in and walk down stairs without looking at the steps. But if you're planning to emulate Kylie's style, you could be in for an expensive surprise. A bespoke pair of high heels costs between £1,230 and £1,650 while men's made-to-measure shoes go for around £2,880. It is a price worth paying, Maistriaux says, for a little piece of Parisian history. 'They are comfortable, they are beautiful and there is something timeless about them.' Hard . at work: Mr Maistriaux is in charge of the workshop which was bought by . the Moulin Rouge in 2006 but has a history that dates back to 1945 .

"It is a plan taken straight from the pages of a science fiction novel -  and potentially a way to exist forever. A San Francisco inventor has revealed plans for a system to upload his brain to a computer. He hopes to be able to replicate the human brain as a mechanical system. Scroll down for video . Randal Koene hopes the brain can be uploaded to a computer, allowing us to inhabit virtual worlds and even visit other planets without having to travel there. Around 85 billion individual neurons make up the human brain. Each is connected to as many as 10,000 others via branches called axons and dendrites. Every time a neuron fires, an electrochemical signal jumps from the axon of one neuron to the dendrite of another, across a synapse between them. These signals encode information and enable the brain to process input, form associations, and execute commands. The patterns may also hold our memories, emotions, personalities, predilections, even our consciousness, according to some. Randal Koene says the key to this is the SIM - a 'Substrate-Independent Mind.' By mapping the brain, reducing its activity to computations, and reproducing those computations in code, Koene argued, humans could live indefinitely, emulated by silicon. 'When I say emulation, you should think of it, for example, in the same sense as emulating a Macintosh on a PC,' he told a recent San Francisco conference. 'It's kind of like platform-independent code.' The thing that makes all of this possible is a 'Substrate-Independent Mind.' This, according to Koene, is not merely an artificial intelligence, but a human mind downloaded to a computer. Neuroscientists are 99.9% percent convinced that the brain is a mechanism, he says. It is something that computes, something that carries out functions. If you can figure out how it works, you can build a replacement for it. 'The idea that you can take a small piece of the brain and build a replica for it is very mainstream and well understood,' he recently told Vice. 'Why not do that with the whole brain? And then why not upload that to a computer so that we can process more data and store it better, the way a computer does, organizing thoughts into folders that we can access whenever we choose?' According to Koene's site, : . 'The functions of mind that we experience are originally implemented through neurobiological mechanisms, the neural circuitry of our brains.

"Dereck Chisora threatened to kill a man whose friend blocked his Mercedes in a car park while they visited the Post Office. The heavyweight boxer admitted in court that he lost his temper during the incident which took place a week after his defeat to British rival Tyson Fury. He screamed: ‘If you don’t move your car I’m going to punch you, smash both of your faces and then the car.’ Dereck Chisora threatened to kill a man who blocked his Mercedes in a car park . The court heard that Chisora swore at driver Mansor Nikpor and threatened to kill his passenger Majid Rezaemi on December 8. The two men left a note on their car with a mobile number if anyone wanted them to move their car while they were at the post office. Chisora shouted at them as they walked away and again on their return. Mr Rezaemi threatened to phone the police but Chisora responded by saying: ‘I’m late for my appointment. I’ll kill you.’ Hendon Magistrates’ Court ruled that Chisora must pay each victim £100 and complete 60 hours of community service after he admitted threatening behaviour with intent to cause fear or provoke unlawful violence towards the pair.’ He told The Sun: ‘I asked politely at first and then when he started to wind me up I told him, “Move the f*****g car. ‘I had just been to buy dinner for my little girl and it was in the car so, yeah, I was really p****d off.

"It contains one of the biggest and brightest stars in our galaxy, weighing at least 90 times the mass of the sun. The Eta Carinae star system, however, also has a dark side - it could bring the end of life on Earth. However, the good news is that experts say this is 'extremely' unlikely - but cannot rule it out. Eta Carinae, also dubbed the 'death star', is a stellar system 7,500 light years from Earth, and it is on the brink of a supernova detonation. 'Simply put, Eta Carinae is a supermassive stellar powder keg nearing the end of its fuse,' said Scientific American. 'It could, in fact, already have met its doom, and the light bearing news of its cataclysmic death could be streaming toward us even now. Eta Carinae, also dubbed the 'death star', is a stellar system 7,500 light years from Earth, and it is on the brink of a supernova detonation. 'As one of the first objects observed by NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory after its launch some 15 years ago, this double star system continues to reveal new clues about its nature through the X-rays it generates,' said Nasa. Astronomers are trying to learn more about the two stars in the Eta Carinae system and how they interact with each other. The heavier of the two stars is quickly losing mass through wind streaming away from its surface at over a million miles per hour. While not the giant purge of the Great Eruption, this star is still losing mass at a very high rate that will add up to the sun's mass in about a millennium. Though smaller than its partner, the companion star in Eta Carinae is also massive, weighing in at about 30 times the mass of the sun. It is losing matter at a rate that is about a hundred times lower than its partner, but still a prodigious weight loss compared to most other stars. The companion star beats the bigger star in wind speed, with its wind clocking in almost ten times faster. Astronomers reported extremely volatile behaviour from Eta Carinae in the 19th century, when it became very bright for two decades, outshining nearly every star in the entire sky. This event became known as the 'Great Eruption.' Data from modern telescopes reveal that Eta Carinae threw off about ten times the sun's mass during that time. The Chandra X-ray Observatory Internet site 14 October, 1999 shows the complex nature of the region around Eta Carinae. Some experts believe that Eta Carinae’s supernova could unleash a gamma-ray burst (GRB), one of the brightest explosions in the universe. This could, in turn, destroy our ozone layer, frying everyone and everything that doesn’t have access to some very, very strong sun block. However Astrophysicist Dr Alan Duffy told Scientific American that this is nearly impossible as ‘we simply aren’t close enough to it and it’s not pointing in our direction in any case’.","Eta Carinae contains one of the biggest and brightest stars in our galaxy .

"A husband has been banned from having sex with his wife by a High Court judge because she does not know she can refuse his advances, it was revealed yesterday. The unidentified Bangladeshi man, who lives in east London, claimed he has the right under his Islamic culture to have sex with the mentally-disabled woman aged 39 whenever he pleases. He has already taken the wife's cousin as a second ‘wife’ in a polygamous Islamic marriage and had two children with her - although still demands the right to have sex with his first wife. Judgment: A judge at the High Court (pictured) in London said the man wanted his wife to come home so he could have sex with his two spouses on alternate days . But with a mental age of four to eight, the wife - identified only as ‘TB’ - has been taken into care under the Mental Health Act by the London Borough of Tower Hamlets where the family lived. All their four children have also been taken into care because she does not have the ability to care for them. But the husband - SA - married to her for 18 years, wanted her back home. A Family Division judge refused this in an anonymised judgment released yesterday. Mr Justice Mostyn said: ‘The evidence clearly shows that TB has barely an inkling of the health risks involved. She was unable to link sex to pregnancy. ‘Indeed she had virtually no idea how her babies came to be in her tummy (as she put it). Although she found sex enjoyable and comfortable she had no idea that she had a choice and could refuse. ‘Indeed the attitude of SA, based, as he told me on his culture and religion, was that he had a right to seek sex from her and that it was her duty to submit.’ The judge said efforts to enlighten TB about sex, her rights, and the risks involved had failed. He added: ‘It is doubtful that TB has ever had the capacity to decide to have sex, notwithstanding that she has had four children.’ Important case: The wife - identified only as ‘TB’ - has been taken into care under the Mental Health Act by the London Borough of Tower Hamlets (whose headquarters are pictured, centre) where the family lived . The couple had a ‘volatile’ relationship and there were instances of domestic violence when the husband lost his temper. After their elder children had been taken into care the judge said it was ‘heartless’ of the husband to make her pregnant again knowing the child would be taken away at birth. The judge said: ‘Sex is a, if not the, basic animal instinct. It is a very powerful instinct. Without it animal (or any) life would not exist. ‘Nature has made it intensely pleasurable in order to seek to ensure the propagation of the species. Most physically fit humans are mechanically capable of engaging in sex irrespective of their mental capacity. ‘Although it is a powerful instinct (I myself would not describe it as visceral) it still requires a positive choice and society demands that that choice is freely exercised by both parties. ‘Our modern society views with repugnance and amazement those barbarous relics that once said, for example, that a man can force sex on his wife.’ Her husband wanted her to come home so he could have sex with his two wives on alternate days, said the judge. He added: 'The right to family life is a qualified right and the evidence overwhelmingly suggests that it is in her best interests that she should live apart from SA. For this reason also it is necessary that SA's right to a family life is compromised.’ He also declared that she did not have the capacity to consent to sex and should be held in accommodation where she received 24-hour care, with the situation reviewed every six months. The judge said the polygamous marriage was valid under Islamic law but invalid in the UK.","Woman is wife in a polygamous Islamic marriage to Bangladeshi man .

"A scathing new report ordered in the wake of the September 19 intrusion into the White House by an armed veteran has found that the Secret Service needs some major overhauls. Included in the report was a finding that the White House's physical security needs tightening in the form of taller fences--at least four to five feet on top of the existing 7.5 feet. The panel also spoke to the needs of the agents themselves saying they need better training, more manpower and fresh leadership. Changes already? Construction workers were seen working on a fence near the Northwest Gate of the White House in Washington on Thursday . A report out this week finds that Secret Services upgrades are badly needed and include White House fences that are at least 4 to 5 feet higher, more and better trained agents and fresh leadership . 'The next director will have to make difficult choices, identifying clear priorities for the organization and holding management accountable for any failure to achieve those priorities,' the group wrote after interviewing 50 Secret Service employees. 'Only a director from outside the (Secret) Service, removed from organizational traditions and personal relationships, will be able to do the honest top-to-bottom reassessment this will require.' Too insular: The review found that fresh leadership is needed in the Secret Service, which it said has become too insular . Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said in a statement that the recommendations are 'astute, thorough and fair.' Many of the proposed changes have been recommended before, including some that date to the Warren Commission Report, which detailed the government investigation into the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Johnson said Thursday the recommendations can't fall by the wayside this time. The panelists were former Obama administration Associate Attorney General Tom Perrelli; former Deputy Attorney General Mark Filip, who served during Bush's term; Danielle Gray, a former assistant to the president for President Barack Obama; and Joe Hagin, deputy chief of staff for operations during the Bush administration. This was the second critical report of the agency and its operations in as many months following the Sept. 19 incident, in which a Texas Army veteran armed with a small knife was able to climb over a White House fence and run deep into the executive mansion before being subdued. In November, an internal review concluded that training, poor staffing and a series of missteps contributed to the breach. Among the mistakes made were that officers had believed that thick shrubbery would stop the intruder from making into the building. Ousted: Julia Pierson was forced to resign as director a day after testifying about the White House breach. Retired Secret Service Agent Joseph Clancy has been acting director since shortly after Pierson's ouster. The new review concluded the Secret Service needs fresh leadership from outside the agency .

The independent panel also concluded that training and lack of staffing was also a serious problem for presidential security. The panel recommended hiring at least 85 agents and 200 uniformed officers. They also recommended that uniformed officers should spend at least 10 percent of their time training. Current staffing levels only allowed for about 25 minutes of training in 2013, the panel said. The panel also suggested replacing the 7 1/2-foot fence around the 18-acre White House complex, although they declined 'to say precisely what the optimal new fence should look like.' The panel made more than 19 recommendations, though many of those directly related to security were deemed classified and not included in the summary.","The December 15 report reveals the security holes investigators say allowed a series of recent embarrassments .

"For miners working during the Soviet regime, it was not an ideal commute. After an 18 hour shift, they would file into these tiny 'metal coffins' dangling over the steep slopes and gorges surrounding the town of Chiatura in Georgia. But despite its rusty and ageing appearance, the 1950's  transport system still takes workers in and out of the valley every day, and is one of the most incredible engineering spectacles in the world. Scroll down for video . Don't look down: The public transport system in Chiatura, Georgia, is an engineering spectacle of the Soviet era . Commute: Soviet era miners took the aerial tramway to work at the manganese processing plants dotted across the hills surrounding Chiatura . Crossing: A cable car dangles over a river at the bottom of the valley in Chiatura, Georgia . The cable car, or 'rope road' was constructed in 1954 after Georgia was annexed by the USSR. Soviet authorities were intent on . extracting vast amounts of manganese, which was discovered in abundance in the area at the turn of the 20th century, when the area was a Bolshevik stronghold. In 1905, a functioning workers' town was built to . extract these vast deposits, and it needed a transport system fit for . purpose. For 50 years, Soviet planners struggled to find a way to navigate around the extremes of the town, so they decided the best solution would be aerial. In an effort to conquer the town's extreme geography, a network of tramways were built so almost every corner of the mining town was accessible. The system transported workers from their homes at the bottom of the gorge to the mines that dotted the mountains. It was also used to transport the manganese to the various factories in the area. Crumbling: A cabin exits of Chiatura's central station which shows signs of ageing both inside and out . Fear: A man appears to be praying as he boards the rust-ridden cable car on the journey down the valley . Still running: Revaze Achvadze, from Chiatura, rides the tramway which continues to transport residents despite its rusty appearance . History: A photo of the tramway just after it had been built in the 1950s. The Soviet authorities wanted a transport system which could efficiently transport workers to the mine at the bottom of the valley . And to this day, it is still fully operational, serving a manganese production plant which is open 24 hours a day. In its heyday Chiatura was responsible for producing 60 per cent of the world's manganese. The chemical element, which was harvested in the region, was used for treating rust and corrosion on steel, which meant it was essential for building armaments and tanks. The town is situated in a mountain valley on . the banks of the Kvirila River, and since 1879 has been a major centre . of manganese production in the Caucasus. During the 1905 . Russian Revolution, Chiatura was the only Bolshevik stronghold in a Menshevik dominated Georgia. Almost 4,000 miners worked 18 hours to maximise the levels of production, with some even sleeping where they dug. Joseph Stalin began his personal affiliation with the town when he persuaded the workers to back Bolshevism during a debate with the Mensheviks. The workers were fond of him and called him 'sergeant major Koba' after he successfully set up a printing press, protection racket and 'red battle squads'. Today, while some of the cars have rusted away, seventeen - including the USSR's first passenger tramway- remain in service. Most tramways in Chiatura use a 'jig back' system where two cabins are connected to the same haulage rope. An electric motor pulls one cabin down, using that cabin's weight to help pull the other cabin up. The tramway has remained despite a volatile history of problems in Georgia. The unique transport system was installed in an effort to conquer the town's extreme geography. A cable car now runs to almost every corner of the mining town . Comparison: One of the tramway stations in 1960, left, and the present day. Little has changed aside from the advertising on the side of the cable car . Forest: The tramway skims over trees during one of its many journeys across the valley . Drop: Because of the steep slopes of the valley, the cable cars have to negotiate some precarious drops as they transport residents around the extremes of Chiatura . Driver: A man operates the cable car system as he tucks into a bowl of apples. The array of buttons and dials have survived since the 1960s when the system was installed . In 1990, there was a crash in Tbilisi, the capital of Soviet Georgia, which resulted in at least 20 deaths and 15 injuries. The . accident involved two gondolas on a ropeway route between Rustaveli . Avenue and Mount Mtatsminda. The cable car was on its way down from the . slope of the mount near the Mtatsminda Pantheon. When . the hauling rope broke the lower gondola rolled back and slammed onto the wall of the station injuring people inside, while the upper gondola rolled at high speeds and dropped 20 metres as the breaks did not work. Standing at the platform: A man waits for a cable car to carry him across the gorge. The wheels which operate the system look brown and rusted . View: A cabin from Tramway 25 travels over the strong currents of the Kvirila River. This would have been a daily spectacle for miners during the Soviet era . Signs of ageing: A discarded piece of track cable has been frayed and left rusted by almost 60 years of constant use . Art: A Socialist realist painting hanging on the inside of a building in Chiatura celebrates the manganese miners of the town . Soviet remnants: A cold war poster proclaiming 'Peace' in Russian and Georgian script hangs in the town . A women meets a fellow passenger in one of the many tramway stations surrounding the town.

"These stunning photographs show a Chinese waterfall that has partially frozen mid-flow. The Hukou Waterfall, or Kettle Mouth Waterfall, has attracted thousands of tourists who marvel at the overspilling ice which formed after temperatures plummeted in Yichuan County. The width of the waterfall changes with the fluctuating temperatures and rainfall. But it is usually nearly 100ft wide, increasing to more than 160ft during flood season. During the deep winter it can be reduced to a fraction of that scale. Scroll down for video .

The scene looks almost surreal and offers keen photographers the perfect opportunity to get a stunning winter shot . Hukou literally means 'flask mouth' because the water hits a narrow section just before plunging over the 35ft edge, creating the appearance that it is being poured from a huge teapot. A frigid autumn, a season in which the mercury rarely rises above freezing, has tamed the usually roaring rapids of the largest waterfall on China's Yellow River, and changed the landscape into a real winter wonderland. The river originates in the Bayan Har Mountains and Anemaqen Mountains and empties into the Bohai Sea drain into the Hai River.

The frozen waterfall looks almost like a series of fluffy clouds, and presents a spectacular addition to the landscape . By the time the water reaches the Hukou Waterfall, it has collected tonnes of fine-grained loess, a mineral-rich silt that has been deposited on land after being carried by the wind. The tiny particles are continuously deposited along the bottom of its channel, causing natural dams to slowly accrue. These subaqueous dams, which are unpredictable and generally undetectable, eventually burst, releasing enormous rushes of water which course along new flood planes to the sea.","The Hukou Waterfall, or Kettle Mouth Waterfall, has attracted thousands of tourists who marvel at the overspill of ice .

"A screaming match over racism erupted between Whoopi Goldberg and Rosie O'Donnell on Thursday's episode of The View. The show's co-hosts were discussing the news that Barack Obama was mistaken for a valet. Goldberg dismissed the confusion as one of stupidity, with Americans failing to identify the most important man in the country and the world. But when O'Donnell suggested racism may have been a key factor in the incident, Goldberg became enraged. Scroll down for video . Fight: Whoopi Goldberg jumped out of her seat as she screamed at co-host Rosie O'Donnell about racism . 'You are a white lady telling me what is racist to you,' she shouted. O'Donnell hit back in the segment: 'I'm a gay American whose been called an [expletive]. 'I have a black kid at my house, Whoopi. I have a black kid I raise!' Goldberg exclaimed: 'That is not the same thing.' O'Donnell: 'You don't have to be black to know what racism is.' Goldberg: 'Yes you do. 'America is not just a racist country, because there are white people who get it. 'That is why I will not accept the blanket statement that American is racist.' The fight comes just a day after the pair exchanged blows during an interview with former supermodel Beverly Johnson, who was on air discussing her claims against Bill Cosby. Anger: Goldberg hit back at O'Donnell's claims that you don't have to be black to understand racism . The dispute came amid a discussion about Barack Obama being mistaken for a valet . The ex-supermodel had reached out to Whoopi privately to share her experience with Cosby after seeing the Oscar winner express endless support for the troubled TV icon on The View. Goldberg asked Johnson to come on The View to discuss her story with their audience. The supermodel said she would, but only if she could sit down one-on-one with Goldberg, who passed her desires along to the show's producers. 'Producers were willing to do whatever Beverly wanted to get her on the show and agreed to cut out Rosie as well as other co-hosts Rosie Perez and Nicolle Wallace. 'That infuriated Rosie,' the source explained. O'Donnell hit the roof hearing that Johnson would appear on The View only in a sit down with Whoopi. She felt the move was a 'slap in the face,' as she has been very vocal in her support for the victims and belief that Cosby is a rapist. Latest outburst: It is not the first time the colleagues have become embroiled in a screaming match . Her passion for the Cosby story has also created tension with fellow co-host Rosie Perez, as previously reported by Mail Online. Perez had a major melt down after a hostile, gum-chewing Rosie O treated her with disdain during an on-air segment discussing the rape allegations against Bill Cosby. Perez had argued that Cosby has been pilloried by social media and that there is no way to prove that the allegations are true. Perez attempted to defend her opinion to O'Donnell but O'Donnell wasn't having it. O'Donnell told producers she 'would not stand for that,' and escalated her complaint to ABC News, that now oversees The View. She went to the network level and complained about the decision. After pleading her case, ABC News actually agreed with her and told producers to go back to Beverly and tell her she had to talk to all of the co-hosts,' the source detailed.","Co-hosts were discussing Barack Obama being mistaken for a valet .

"Former Sons of Guns star Will Hayden has now been indicted in two separate child rape cases . An East Baton Rouge Parish grand jury has indicted former reality TV star Will Hayden on three counts of rape involving two victims. The Advocate reports the 49-year-old Hayden, who once starred in the 'Sons of Guns' TV show based out of his Baton Rouge gun shop, was charged Wednesday with two counts of aggravated rape and one count of forcible rape. Hayden is accused of raping a young girl multiple times between March 2013 and August According to the indictment. The assaults allegedly began a few days after the girl's 11th birthday. He's also accused of raping a woman in the early 1990s and was charged with forcible rape in that incident. Hayden's attorney, Frank Holthaus, could not confirm the indictment, saying he had yet to see it. Hayden was arrested August 27. After the arrest, The Discovery Channel canceled the show, citing 'the serious and horrific nature of the charges' against the star. He was arrested on aggravated rape charges involving a child and had already faced child molestation and aggravated crime against nature charges stemming from an arrest August 9. Hayden began having sex with the child, then 11 years old, in 2013, according to allegations in an affidavit filed by sheriff's deputies. The latest rape, the report said, happened in July. A guardian of the victim contacted deputies Aug. 16. The victim confided to the guardian after Hayden's Aug. 9 arrest, according to the report. Hayden is accused of raping a young girl multiple times between March 2013 and August According to the indictment, the assaults allegedly began a few days after the girl's 11th birthday. Deputies said they met with the child and guardian and took a statement. According to the affidavit, the child told deputies Hayden took her virginity when she was 11 years old and that sex acts happened almost daily thereafter. The report says Hayden coerced the victim into silence with threats of physical abuse. 'Don't tell them nothing because I'm all you've got,' the affidavit says the 49-year-old Hayden told the victim. 'Sons of Guns' began airing in 2011 and followed Hayden's family-owned custom firearms business. Episodes often showed Hayden and his adult daughter, Stephanie, helping customers find weapons, including rifles. Other scenes showed the process of making the guns, images from firing ranges, and ammunition tips. 'Sons of Guns' began airing in 2011 and followed Hayden's family-owned custom firearms business.

"Teenagers who regularly smoke cannabis suffer long lasting brain damage and are in much greater danger of developing schizophrenia. American researchers say the drug is particularly dangerous for a group of people who have a genetic susceptibility to the mental health disorder - and it could be the trigger for it. Asaf Keller, of the University of . Maryland School of Medicine, said the results highlight the dangers of . teenagers smoking cannabis during their formative years. The study found that even short-term exposure to cannabis impaired brain activity, with the damage continuing into adulthood . The study, published in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology, exposed young mice to the active ingredient in marijuana for 20 days. It found that their brain activity was impaired, with the damage continuing into adulthood. The past 20 years has seen major controversy about the long-term effects of marijuana, with experts divided over its long-term effects on teenagers. Previous research has shown that children who started using marijuana before the age of 16 are at greater risk of permanent brain damage, and have a significantly higher incidence of psychiatric disorders. ‘Adolescence is the critical period during which marijuana use can be damaging,’ said the study's lead author, Sylvina Mullins Raver, a PhD candidate at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. ‘We wanted to identify the biological underpinnings and determine whether there is a real, permanent health risk to marijuana use.’ The scientists began by examining cortical oscillations in mice. Cortical oscillations are patterns of the activity of neurons in the brain and are believed to underlie the brain's various functions. These oscillations are very abnormal in schizophrenia and in other psychiatric disorders. VIDEO: Scientists explain how cannabis damages the teenage brain . V . The scientists exposed young mice to very low doses of the active ingredient in marijuana for 20 days, and then allowed them to return to their siblings and develop normally. ‘In the adult mice exposed to marijuana ingredients in adolescence, we found that cortical oscillations were grossly altered, and they exhibited impaired cognitive abilities,’ said Raver. ‘We also found impaired cognitive . behavioural performance in those mice. The striking finding is that, . even though the mice were exposed to very low drug doses, and only for a . brief period during adolescence, their brain abnormalities persisted . into adulthood.’ The scientists repeated the . experiment, this time giving marijuana to adult mice that had never been . exposed to the drug before. According to the research team, there is a group of people who have a genetic susceptibility to developing schizophrenia. Adding weed to the mix during adolescence could be the trigger that causes it to develop, permanently impairing brain function and cognition . Their cortical oscillations and ability to perform cognitive tasks remained normal, indicating that it was only drug exposure during the critical teenage years that impaired brain activity. ‘We found that the frontal cortex is much more affected by the drugs during adolescence,’ said Keller.‘This is the area of the brain controls executive functions such as planning and impulse control. It is also the area most affected in schizophrenia.’ Keller now wants to know whether the effects can be reversed. ‘We are hoping we will learn more about schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders, which are complicated conditions,’ he said. ‘These cognitive symptoms are not affected by medication, but they might be affected by controlling these cortical oscillations.’ A separate study by Imperial College . London last month revealed that long-term use of cannabis destroys . dopamine, the feel-good chemical in the brain that inspires a spirit of . get-up-and-go. Previous research has suggested taking marijuana can lead to individuals becoming withdrawn, lethargic and apathetic. The cannabis users in the study . published in Biological Psychiatry had all experienced psychotic-like . symptoms while smoking the drug such as strange sensations or having . feelings of paranoia. The researchers expected their . dopamine production might be higher since this has been linked with . psychosis - but instead found the opposite. The cannabis users had their first . experience with the drug between the ages of 12 and 18 and the . researchers believe the drug could be the cause of the difference in . dopamine levels. 'Cannabis is an illegal drug and . there is mounting evidence the idea of it being a harmless herb is not . true,’ said Dr Michael Bloomfield, of Imperial College London. 'When people stop taking cannabis it seems the brain can slowly go back to producing pretty normal levels of dopamine. 'Cannabis has effects on the brain and it’s important people can make an informed decision.'","U.S. study found that mice exposed to even small doses of marijuana for 20 days suffered lasting brain damage into adulthood .

"The relentless barrage of freezing weather and snow storms hitting most of the U.S. may seem like more of a hassle than a winter wonderland, but there are some perks to the bitter cold. Freezing temperatures have created the perfect conditions to visit Wisconsin's Apostle Islands caves, accessed by walking a mile out onto a iced-over Lake Superior. For the first time in five years, visitors are able to explore the island's caves which have been turned into a 'fairyland of needle-like icicles' thanks to that polar vortex. Frozen over: For the first time in five years, visitors can trek a mile out onto Lake Superior to explore the Apostle Islands' caves covered in ice . Rare opportunity: Not since the winter of 2009 have conditions been right to make the journey from shore to the islands safe enough to cross on foot . Winter wonderland: In the cold months, the islands' caves become a 'fairyland of needle-like icicles' The caves are a popular destination during the summer when they can be accessed by kayak, but they're even more of a draw during winter when as many as 1,000 people a day make the trip on the weekend. 'The formations we are seeing this year are some of the best I've ever seen,' Neil Howk, assistant chief of interpretation with the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, told WDIO. 'People love coming out here in the summer because the cliffs and the caves are just beautiful, but this time of year...it's incredible,' Mr Howk added. Popular destination: The park gets about 1,000 visitors a weekend when the caves are open during the winter, much more than in summer . Safety first: Visitors make the trek wearing cleets, snow shoes or skis so as not to slip . Solid ice: Park officials closely monitor the ice conditions to make sure the crossing is safe . Exceptional year: Neil Howk, who works with the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, said the ice formations this year are 'some of the best I've ever seen . When the thaw comes: The caves are accessed in the summer by kayak . Visual tricks; The caves appear to be covered in beautiful rock formations that are actually stalactites and stalagmites made entirely of ice . 'For most people, walking on a frozen Great Lake is just a remarkable experience psychologically, let alone physically,' park superintendent Bob Krumanaker told Wisconsin Public Radio. 'It's pretty solid generally and depending on the visibility it could be as white as far as you can see. But you know the lake is under it and sometimes you can even feel the ice move a  little bit.' Krumanaker describes the interior of the caves, saying they are covered with what looks to be beautiful rock formations but in reality is stalactites and stalagmites made entire of ice. GPS: The caves are located 18 miles east of Bayfield, Wisconsin . Like glass: Park superintendent Bob Krumanaker says you can see straight to the bottom of the lake in some parks of the caves . See them while you can: Park officials hope to keep the islands open for another six weeks, but conditions could make them inaccessible as soon as Saturday . Great view: A visitor surveys Lake Superior from one of the caves' entrances . Dog trip: Two dogs play in the snow outside the caves . Superior at sunset: Ice creates an alien landscape on the top of Lake . 'And then if you carefully crawl under some of that ... the ice is completely smooth and generally completely clear underneath it. So, it’s like there’s a glass floor that you can see the bottom of the lake,' he said. The caves are located 18 miles west of Bayfield, Wisconsin. Krumanaker hopes they'll be open for another six weeks, but conditions could make them unreachable soon.

"A millionaire hotel owner attacked his estranged wife's new lover with his nine-year-old son's cricket bat after discovering the pair of them had starting sleeping together, a court heard. Nigel Underwood, 45, previously ran the  Grade-II listed Oaklands Hall Hotel in Laceby, Lincolnshire, with wife Sarah, 45. But a court heard in July this year the businessman took his wife to rehab to treat an addiction to alcohol. Sarah Underwood's affair prompted her husband (centre) to attack her lover Andrew Wordsworth (right) with a their 9-year-old son's cricket bat. There Sarah struck up a relationship with another recovering addict Andrew Wordsworth, 47, at the rehabilitation centre in Barnsley, South Yorks. Lincoln Crown Court heard on September 11 that Sarah returned to a caravan where she had been staying following her treatment with her new lover. Underwood was waiting for them at the site in Chapel St Leonards, Lincolnshire, and produced the wooden bat from his car after spotting his love rival. He then launched at Mr Wordsworth and battered him the weapon causing injuries to his left arm and head. On Tuesday Underwood - who also runs the Savoy Hotel and Suncastle Entertainment Complex in Skegness, Lincolnshire - admitted assault and possession of an offensive weapon. He walked free from court after being given a 12-month community order with supervision. Jilted husband Nigel Underwood said he wants to make amends with his estranged wife Sarah . Sarah and Nigel are co-owners of plush Oaklands Hall Hotel in Laceby, Lincolnshire . The entrepreneur was also ordered to pay £250 compensation to Mr Wordsworth, £250 prosecution costs as well as a £60 victim surcharge. Underwood defended his actions, saying: 'He took my wife off me - I just did what any man would have done.' The court heard the incident happened after Sarah had collected her new lover following his discharge from the rehab centre. Andrew Scott, prosecuting, said: 'Mr Wordsworth was a recovering alcoholic. Mrs Underwood was also a recovering alcoholic. 'They met at a treatment centre in Barnsley. 'They started up a relationship and when Mrs Underwood was discharged she said she wanted a separation. 'She moved to a caravan in Chapel St Leonards. The defendant did not take the news very well. 'Mr Wordsworth was struck a glancing blow to the head but managed to protect himself with his arm.' Underwood later went to Skegness Police Station where he handed himself in and confessed to what he had done. Nigel Underwood said he did the 'honourable' thing by handing himself in after the attack . Mr Scott added: 'The defendant described his actions as stupid. In interview he said that when his wife came out of rehab she was a different person. 'She said she needed space. 'She was still coming back to their home. 'When she didn't come back that night he went to see where she was.' Sentencing Underwood, from Skegness, Recorder Ciaran Rankin told him: 'You are an intelligent and successful businessman employing many people. 'It is clear that this happened at an emotionally charged time in your life.' 'Honest, upstanding man': Nigel Underwood said he had strong community support after the attack . Sunil Khanna, defending, said Underwood had no previous convictions and was embarrassed by what he had done. He added: 'He is a very sensible and honest, upstanding man.' Speaking after the case Underwood, who has three children with wife Sarah, said he still loved his wife and would take her back. He added: 'I just want my wife back. We have three children together and I just want her to be better. 'Instead, she is shacked up with a recovering alcoholic. I just did what any man would do. I acted honourably as I could and handed myself in straight away. 'That was the night I found they had started a physical relationship and I wasn't happy about it. 'When I saw him I just had to clock him one. 'He was with my wife, who I have stood by for 15 years while she has battled alcoholism. 'On the night she said she had been worried and I wanted to see she was OK and hadn't hit the Barcadi again. 'I had the cricket bat because it was my son's and I help run the borough district cricket team. He came towards me so I reacted and walloped him. 'I was looking out for her because I still love to bits. 'Everybody has stood by me, I had members of my family and members of the Skegness Round Table, where I am chairman, present at court to support me. 'But I have lost a wife, my children have lost their mother, it is a sorry state of affairs but we all love and care for her still.'","Nigel Underwood, 45, took wife Sarah, 45, to rehab to treat alcohol addiction .

"The dramatic moment that Rosetta's Philae comet lander bounced back into space has been captured in a remarkable image. Philae successfully landed on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in November, but not before a failure to launch its harpoons and a thruster caused it to bounce twice before settling. The blurry image captures the rapid motion in which Philae was bounced back. The probe was launched to a height of 0.62 miles (1km) and then to a much lower height of 65ft (20 metres) before coming to rest. Scroll down for video . Bounce back: The blurry image captures the rapid motion in which Philae was launched back out into space. The probe was launched to a height of 0.62 miles (1km) and then to a much lower height of 65ft (20 metres) before coming to rest . Scientists described the comet's ground as being more like a 'trampoline' than rock, owing to its soft and powdery texture, which may have caused the unsteady landing of the probe. The image was taken by Philae's Civa camera, which was designed to capture the moment the probe settled on the surface. 'That image was a shock because obviously we were not still - we were moving,' co-principal investigator Jean-Pierre Bibring told Jonathan Amos at the BBC. 'It demonstrated together with [other data] that we were not on the comet. The team suffered an agonising wait before telemetry revealed whether the bounce velocity was high enough for the probe to escape the comet's weak gravity. Toppled: In this graphic, Civa images have been used to construct a model of the final landing location. Scientists described the ground as being more like a 'trampoline' than rock, owing to its soft and powdery texture, which may have caused the unsteady landing . Reflection: This image, named 'Perihelion Cliff', shows a wall next to the robot, with reflections from Philae shown by the glare marks . Three historic landings: This graphic shows the team's current best guess at how events unfolded. The probe landed on the comet at around 3.30pm GMT on the 12th of November but then bounced twice - first to a height of 0.62 miles (1km) and then to a much lower height of 65ft (20 metres) before coming to rest. It is currently thought to be about 0.62 miles (1km) from its intended landing site . Professor Bibring also revealed a reprocessed Civa image taken by Philae  at the American Geophysical Union's Fall Meeting in San Francisco. The image, named 'Perihelion Cliff', depicts one of the walls looming over the robot, with reflections from Philae shown by glare marks. The Rosetta probe, which was carrying Philae, launched into space in 2004, using the gravity of Earth and Mars to slingshot its way towards comet 67P. It chased comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko through space for more than ten years, and entered orbit in August 2014. After a four billion mile (6.5 billion km) journey, the probe then successfully released the Philae lander from its grip to land on the comet on 12 November 2014, travelling at 1 metre (40 inches) per second relative to the comet. But when it first made contact with the surface it failed to fire harpoons that would have kept it attached to the comet. This resulted in it bouncing to a height of 0.62 miles (1km) above the comet before again landing on the surface. It then bounced again, but to a much lower altitude. Scientists recently said that water on the comet was different to that on Earth - suggesting water on our world came from an asteroid, not a comet. Civa took sharper images of the 67P's terrain, but these were taken after the probe had fallen into a dark ditch, unable to get the sunlight it needed to recharge its batteries. Another image shows a reconstruction a model of Philae's final landing location. Rosetta engineers claim the plucky probe could come back to life as soon as March next year, as comet 67P gets closer to the sun. The probe is currently only receiving around an hour of sunlight during the comet's 12-hour day, with its batteries frozen in temperatures of -170°C. In a recent Reddit 'ask me anything' session, engineers at mission control said: 'We expect to have enough energy to boot around March next year. 'Then Philae needs to be heated until we can think of starting to charge the battery. The batteries were meant to be recharged by solar panels, but because Philae hopped a couple of times after the first touchdown, it ended up in shadow. 'It is like trying to power your house with solar panels when you live in Alaska just below the Arctic Circle during the winter,' said Michael Maibaum, Philae systems engineer. But despite the probe losing power earlier than expected, Philae and the Rosetta spacecraft have already made a number of important discoveries. Last week, Rosetta found water around the comet calling into question a leading theory about how the Earth got its oceans. The finding suggests that rocky asteroids rather than icy comets may have been chiefly responsible for bringing water to Earth early in its history. Unlike the Earth's oceans, the vapour largely consists of water with a different atomic flavour containing deuterium, the 'heavy' isotope of hydrogen. The amount of deuterium compared with normal hydrogen in the comet's water is three times greater than it is in water on Earth. This suggests that so-called Jupiter-family comets, such as 67P, cannot be assumed to have created the oceans on Earth. In contrast, meteorites falling on Earth that originate from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter tend to match the composition of Earth ocean water. Rough ride: The Osiris camera on the Rosetta orbiter took a number images of Philae as it descended toward its touchdown on the comet on November 12. Images showthe spacecraft rotating, and  evidence of the lander's touchdown on the comet surface. One final image, captured 9 minutes after the landing, sees the spacecraft bright against the comet's surface . True colours: The Max Planck Institute in Germany has revealed the true colour of 67P (left). The image reveals what the comet would look like to the human eye. On the right is an image taken taken by a Rosetta instrument dubbed Osiris . Bumpy ride: Ahead of the landing, Rosetta took a number of images of Philae during its daring descent. This view shows the lander's consert antennae deployed. It also shows three lander feet and the Rolis descent camera boom . Major discovery: Scientists recently said that water on the comet was different to that on Earth - suggesting water on our world came from an asteroid, not a comet.

"A newlywed recently announced on his blog that he's come to a conclusion: marriage is not for him. However, rather than being met with a chorus of disapproval, Seth Adam Smith's piece has been read almost four million times, and his wife is in full agreement with his sentiments. 'Having been married only a year and a half, I've recently come to the conclusion that marriage isn't for me,' he writes. Love and marriage: Seth Adam Smith (right) has been married to his wife Kim (left) for less than two years . The viral story of the moment is spreading like wildfire, possibly because of its click-bait title. The loaded title, 'Marriage Isn't For You' and the opening gambit is enough to intrigue the many readers who have shared it via social media such as Facebook and Twitter. But Smith, a Mormon, takes a very different turn to the one most readers are expecting. How? Well, what Seth Adam Smith is getting at is, his marriage isn't about him. 'No, a true marriage (and true love) is never about you. It's about the person you love - their wants, their needs, their hopes, and their dreams. Selfishness demands, ""What's in it for me?"" while Love asks, ""What can I give?""' he writes. Blogger: Seth Adam Smith is a Mormon blogger and editor-in-chief of ForwardThinking.com, which aims to help people think positively . The Alaskan-born Florida resident says he and his wife Kim met when they were just 15 years old. They were friends for 10 years before their relationship became something more, and a year-and-a-half ago, they got married. 'The nearer Kim and I approached the decision to marry, the more I was filled with a paralyzing fear. Was I ready? Was I making the right choice? Was Kim the right person to marry? Would she make me happy?' he writes. A conversation with his father put paid to any doubts Smith had about his upcoming nuptials. 'Seth, you’re being totally selfish. So I’m going to make this really simple: marriage isn’t for you. You don’t marry to make yourself happy, you marry to make someone else happy,' Smith's father told him. 'More than that, your marriage isn’t for yourself, you’re marrying for a family. Not just for the in-laws and all of that nonsense, but for your future children. Who do you want to help you raise them? Who do you want to influence them? Marriage isn’t for you. It’s not about you. Marriage is about the person you married,' he said. The blogger and editor-in-chief of ForwardWalking.com has tried to carry his father's advice with him through his first months of marriage. His message about the nature of true love and marriage has struck a chord with many of those who have read it and it's been reprinted everywhere from HuffPost to Desert News. Smith says the story has had almost four million hits. One commenter wrote, 'Loved it! After 15 years of marriage, and several near misses with that grey line in the affair department, my husband finally figured that out... I finally was ready to walk away...  He would now tell you he was so wrong and not thinking about that other ‘person’ he should have been taking care of – our marriage.' Selfless love: Smith (right) says it's his father's advice and his wife Kim's (left) kindness that made his realize what marriage is all about . Another tweeted, 'Thanks for posting that ""marriage isn't for you"" article it changed my mind on that archaic, disenfranchising, and oppressive tradition!' It's also received backlash from cynics for its simplistic view of marriage and the author's relatively short one. 'One of the most overrated institutions on the planet. Only makes sense if you don't have a Will,' wrote a commentator on HuffPost. 'Marriage isn't for men, with the divorce laws, child support and alimony what man wants to get married,' said another. 'And marriage isn't for women either, because in most cases you just end up being a nanny, nurse, housekeeper, second income, etc,' came the retort. Viral: Smith says his blog post about marriage has had four million hits . 'Sounds like a nice sentiment. Could not help but thinking though that it would have a lot more credibility if the author had made it past the 2 year mark first...

"No bail: Stacey Smalls, 41, faces attempted murder, aggravated assault and child engagement charges . The mother who allegedly killed her 18-month-old twins to get revenge against her husband who she thought was cheating is being held without bail. Authorities in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, announced new charges against Stacy Smalls, 41, on Tuesday, who is believed to have strangled one of her twins and smothered the other. She also allegedly fed her four-year-old daughter an unknown prescription medication in an attempt to poison her. Smalls faces two counts of first-degree murder and one count each of attempted murder, aggravated assault, child endangerment and reckless endangerment.

Her husband, Ron Smalls, returned to . their home after work as a corrections officer and found the children's . bodies and his wife with her wrists slashed. He . frantically called 911 at 4 p.m. and told police his wife had killed . their babies and tried to poison their four-year-old daughter. When police arrived at the scene they found the woman who told them: 'I harmed my babies.' The . 18-month-old twins, Adam and Eve, were found limp and lifeless on a bed . in the front bedroom. They were pronounced dead at 4.10 p.m. Police say . they appeared to have died of suffocation. Scroll down for video .

Four . notes next to the children read, 'This is why I killed your kids,' and . detailed the mother's allegations of the husband’s affair, ABC reported.

Police believe she gave her four-year-old daughter prescription pills. The young girl was reported to be in a stable and good condition at St. Christopher's Hospital for Children. Doctors were working to determine exactly what substance her mother had given her. Police . added that Smalls, who worked as a nurse at a nursing home, had . apparently made attempts to take her own life by slashing her wrists and . downing pills herself. Innocence: One twin is believed to have been drowned while the other is believed to have been smothered . On her Facebook page there are signs of a troubled marriage. She announced her marriage to Ron Smalls on December 17, 2010, but changed her relationship status to 'divorced' on May 19. Her profile picture is an image of a car that she downloaded from the internet. Words sprayed across the side of the car read: 'Hope she was worth it.' Of the photo, she added: 'I liked her style'. Both Stacey and her husband have uploaded pictures of the youngsters. On one of Ron's pictures of his daughters, he wrote: 'Sisters, what a beautiful thing'. But on Wednesday, just one day before the slayings, Stacey wrote on the picture: 'Really, sisters what a beautiful thing. I guess it depends on which sister' - perhaps in a nod to Ron's alleged affair. 'Killer': Stacey Smalls (left) is thought to have killed her twins (right) in a jealous rage after her husband allegedly had an affair with another family member . Anger: Her Facebook profile picture shows an image she uploaded from the internet of a car scrawled with the words 'Hope she was worth it' - in a nod to her husband's alleged affair . On Friday, just one day after the deaths of his children, Ron Smalls dumped items - including their playpen, toys and highchairs - on the curb outside the home as a trash truck pulled up. He told NBC 10 he was not ready to talk about the deaths but that his eldest daughter was stable. Despite the public declarations of problems in the marriage, neighbours and coworkers said Stacey Smalls had appeared to be herself in recent days. Tina Brown, who works with Smalls at River's Edge Nursing Home, saw her at work the morning of the killings - and said there was no sign of anything wrong. 'She said, ""Hey, it's a good day."" That's all. She said, ""Hi Tina, have a good day at work"" and she left. She didn't seem stressed out or anything like that,' Brown said. Neighbors were also shocked by the grisly scene and described Smalls as a pleasant woman. Shocked: Neighbors break down at the ghastly scene where a mother suffocated her toddler twins . Scene: Smalls's husband Ron called 911 after finding the bodies in his Tacony, Philadelphia home . 'What was so bad that you did that?' Adrienne Birnie, told the Philadelphia Daily News. 'If you can’t take it, give your kids to a neighbour.' Other neighbors left candles and flowers on the porch where Smalls often sat with her children as they struggled to come to terms with the devastating news. Celiness Espinosa, 36, said: 'What went wrong, I don’t know. I don’t even want to imagine.' Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey added: 'It's obviously even more tragic when you have young children, year and a half old. It's a pretty sad sight.' Both Stacey and Ron Smalls were interviewed by police following the tragedy. Stacey Smalls is currently in hospital for treatment of her injuries. She will be charged with two counts of murder, Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey told NBC10.

"It is the heat of battle between two MMA fighters hemmed inside an industrial metal cage. One kicks, punches and strangles his way to brutal victory. His opponent breaks down and cries tears for his mother. But this is not an unusual end to another televised brawl between two fully grown brutes, this is kids's MMA, or Mixed Martial Arts, which is rapidly becoming one of the nation's fastest growing sports among children. It is estimated that three million boys and girls, some as young as five-years-old launch themselves at each other weekly across the nation engaged in Pankration - some wearing no head protection and throwing punches boasting gloves little more than one-inch thick. Effort: Kristofer ""The Arm Collector"" Arrey, 7, chokes Mason Bramlette, 7, during 2013 California State Pankration Championships Youth Division. Pankration is a version of the popular Mixed Martial Arts (MMA)-style fighting that is adapted for children . Critics call it barbaric and fear for the children's safety and the effect on their behavior. Supporters compare it's benefits to boxing and traditional martial arts and claim that it encourages self-discipline, fair play and exercise. A New-York based photographer, Sebastian Montalvo, traveled across the country and compiled a photographic essay in which he attempts to shine a light onto the ferocious sport, giving names and faces to the little children whose parents are encouraging their fighting spirit. One such child, is Kristopher Arrey. He is seven years old and his success in the MMA ring is so fearsome that he has earned the nickname 'The Arm Collector'. Tears: Mason ""The Beast"" Bramlette, 7, cries after receiving a punch during 2013 California State Pankration Championships Youth Division . Parker, Arizona, United States: Kristofer ""The Arm Collector"" Arrey, 7, and Cross Betzhold, 6, prepare for their bout at a United States Fight League Pankration All-Star tournament held at the BlueWater Resort and Casino . Parker, Arizona, United States: Kristofer ""The Arm Collector"" Arrey, 7, pins Cross Betzhold, 6, against the cage during a United States Fight League Pankration All-Star tournament held at the BlueWater Resort and Casino . In one striking and arguably disturbing image from Montalvo, Arrey is on his back, inflicting a painful choke-hold on another boy. Once this fight ends in victory for Arrey, his defeated opponent, Mason Bramlette, who is also seven, is seen crying - an illuminating image which reminds the viewer exactly how old the fighter's are. Montalvo told CNN that parental encouragement is key to the growth of MMA. 'Are you OK?' Montalvo heard the referee asking Mason as tears streamed down his face. 'Do you want to stop fighting?'. His father urged his son to stay in the ring. Indeed, Montalvo said that the key aspect of kid's MMA was how competitive the parents are. 'They're mega-competitive,' Montalvo said. They 'love their kids 100%' and 'they just want them to win.' San Bernardino, California, United States: Mason ""The Beast"" Bramlette, 7, is choked by his opponent during a Pankration tournament held at Adrenaline Combat Sports and Fitness .

Riverside, California, United States:  Kriss Arrey, 7, and Justin Ramirez, 7, receive trophies after winning a Pankration tournament organized by the United States Fight League in Riverside . And while critics may reel at the sight of children placed in a ring and asked to fight like adults, supporters say it encourages a culture of losing fair and winning well. 'After every match, the kids are supposed to shake hands,' said Montalvo. 'One father started screaming at his son because he didn't want to shake hands after he lost.' As MMA classes pop up around the country, some catering for children as young as five, there are concerns about the safety risks of young children taking part in such a violent contact sport. A quick search of YouTube throws up countless videos showing boys and girls competing in MMA. Some of the videos are more violent than others, boys and girls in cages punching, kicking and choking each other. More tears: Sacramento, California, United States: Daniel Arrellano, 6, cries after being defeated in the 2013 California State Pankration Championships Youth Division. Arrellano finished second in the age 5-7 under 55lbs category . Chris Conolley is an MMA teacher, who owns Spartan Fitness in Hoover, Alabama, he is quick to point out that what the kids get taught is very different from the adult version. Rather than fighting each other, his pupils are taught the techniques to get in shape and have fun. ‘It's an outstanding way for them to get in shape, exercise. Childhood obesity now is a big issue [this can] get them on the right path conducive to fitness,’ Conolley said in an interview with Fox6 earlier this year. Nevertheless injuries, especially concussions, are a constant risk and doctors recommend that children should always wear headgear even when training. The kids of MMA are taking their cues from the 'Ultimate Fighting Championship' or 'UFC' where moves like the 'Ground Pound' and the 'Cobra Strangle' have millions tuning in every week. Prominent critics of MMA for adults including Senator John McCain, who called it 'human cockfighting' and in 2008 wrote a letter to the governors of every state asking them to ban it. 'I think it's dangerous from a physical standpoint,' pediatrician Lisa Thornton told Good Morning America. 'It can lead to significant injuries to the neck and bones and ligaments.'",Children's MMA or Pankration is one of the fastest growing sports in the United States with an estimated 3 million kids involved .

"Tom Cruise's powerhouse lawyer has taken at a swipe at Katie Holmes, accusing her and her legal team of 'playing the media.' While Cruise, 50, has kept silent save for the statement he issued immediately after Katie made her announcement, his lawyer Bert Fields spoke to the BBC yesterday about the impending battle between the couple and their fight for custody of Suri, six. And in a thinly veiled attack on the former Dawson's Creek actress, he said: 'We are letting ‘the other side’ (Katie and her team), . play the media until they wear everyone out and then we’ll have . something to say.' Split: Katie Holmes, pictured today shopping, has been accused of manipulating the media . Under attack: Katie Holmes has been accused by her estranged husband Tom Cruise's lawyer of 'playing the media' in order to win public sympathy . He added: 'Tactically we can’t say where Tom will file a divorce case and if he’ll be seeking joint custody of Suri.' Hollywood brief: Bert Fields seen right in1993, is best known for representing Michael Jackson and Kevin Costner . It was . certainly an unprecedented broadside intended to draw sympathy away from the actor's estranged wife, and . all the more notable as Tom, who celebrated turning 50 this week is . notoriously private. Fields, who spoke to BBC Radio 1's . Newsbeat, would not be drawn on . specific details of the divorce - but did use his opportunity to express . that his client was 'really sad about what's happening'. He added: 'It’s not Tom’s style to do this publicly. He is really sad about what’s happening.' It . is believed Katie wants legal custody because she is worried about . Tom's devotion to sci-fi cult Scientology and the effect the . quasi-religious sect may have on their six-year-old daughter. However a source told TMZ: . '[Katie] was totally committed to Scientology. She had enthusiasm for . it and would voluntarily and gladly participate in it when Tom was off . shooting movies. 'This is not a fight over religion. It's being used as a way to hurt Tom.' The now warring spouses are not speaking, but Tom is reportedly calling Suri 'several times a day'. Tom has borne the brunt of the negative publicity surrounding the divorce, and it seems his lawyer is keen to redress the balance. But yet more revelations emerged today claiming Tom controlled Katie 'like a puppetmaster making every major and minor decision in her personal and professional life', wrote TMZ. Tea time: Katie and Suri also had a meal at Alice's tea cup during their girly day out together . And sources close to the actress claimed: 'In the end, she felt like she couldn't breathe without his permission.' Solo outing: Katie and Suri enjoyed another day out this time with some playmates in New York . In 2005, early in the couple's relationship during filming of Thank You for Smoking Tom allegedly instructed producers . to 'kill' any promotional photos which showed Katie and co-star Aaron Eckhart . engaged in kissing or 'anything else compromising.' He is also said to have imposed his will during her stint on Batman Begins to prevent Katie from flying with the rest of the cast. Instead, Katie was made to travel to set on Tom's private jet. A source told TMZ actor Morgan Freeman was supposedly 'disgusted' by the situation. Field's attack came as Katie stepped out looking worryingly thin with a tired looking Suri. Katie . carried her daughter during a trip with friends - accompanied by . security - to the Children's Museum of the Arts in the Soho area of New . York City. And a long-limbed Suri, dressed in a pink dress and holding onto a cuddly toy, clung on to her actress mother. Yesterday, Katie - who filed for divorce from the Hollywood . star last week - spent American holiday Independence Day as a single . mother for the first time. The Dawson's Creek beauty was seen at Wholefoods supermarket near her Chelsea apartment stocking up on food supplies. It emerged yesterday that Katie had been secretly planning her divorce . assault for several weeks with the help of her father Martin Holmes. Exhausted: Suri Cruise looks tired by the news her . parents are set for a custody battle following their divorce . The secretive plan included switching all her cell phones and email addresses. Katie was said to be contact with Tom, right up until last week, playing the role of doting wife. 'She was talking to Tom on the phone up until last week saying, ""I love you,""' a source told People magazine. But the escape plan was well underway when the actress recently visited China for work commitments. 'Her inner circle has been planning this and switching out cell phones since she was in China [in mid-June],' the source said. 'When . new cell phones arrived, then nobody could reach her. Her old best . friends from last week don't have her new number, no e-mail. She's . unreachable.' Katie even allegedly bent the truth to Tom about her new Chelsea apartment. Protected: Katie was flanked by a burly security guard . '[Tom] knew that she moved there, but [he thought it was] for different reasons,' the source told People. 'She . said she moved there to drive into the underground garage. There are . fewer paparazzi and it's less intrusive for her,' the source continued. 'It was the first phase of getting . everything out of the house, and that's why she was able to say she's . moving without giving an indication that she was going to divorce him.' Katie's father also fired some of his daughter's assistants and hired new ones in place to help out with the grand plan. In their new apartment building, neighbours say mother and daughter are a joy to have. Moving on: Katie Holmes was seen at Wholefoods supermarket near her Chelsea apartment yesterday, stocking up on supplies . 'Katie and Suri have been very . friendly to everyone they see in the building,' a source told Radaronline. 'But they mostly keep to themselves.' The way they were: Katie announced that she was splitting with her husband of six years last Friday . However the pair have been spotted using the communal children's playroom. 'Suri was there playing. Katie was with her and they were very sweet to the other people in the room. 'There were a few other kids there and . Suri quietly played with them. She seemed like a nice little girl and . the other kids looked like they were having fun with her.' Tom, who has kept busy by shooting his latest movie Oblivion in . Iceland, returned to Los Angeles earlier this week where he marked his 50th . birthday with a quiet lunch alongside adopted children Connor and . Isabella but not Suri. He is said to have made it his 'first priority' to get temporary visitation rights to his daughter Suri. The . 50-year-old actor - who was 'blindsided' when his wife filed for . divorce from him last week after five years of marriage and sought legal . custody of their child - intends to go to court in Los Angeles in . person to ensure he is legally allowed to see the youngster. Katie filed for the divorce in New . York because she believes she has a better chance of winning sole custody, . and although Tom was encouraged to file in California, the law states . divorce cannot be filed in separate states at the same time. A . source said: 'Tom has told Dennis Wasser and Bert Fields, his long-time . entertainment lawyer, that his first priority is getting a court order . in place, obviously a temporary one, that will allow him to legally see . his daughter. 'Team Cruise . has extensive documentation to prove that Los Angeles is where the case . should proceed, because this is where he says they have lived. 'Tom . is extremely disappointed that Katie filed in New York, and he feels . that she is trying to cut him out of their daughter's life. 'Tom . won't tolerate it and told his lawyers that if he personally needs to . go to court and make a plea in front of the judge for an order allowing . him to see his daughter, he will.'","Sources close to Tom say divorce was NOT over Scientology .

"Two jihadi clerics and a New York lawyer implored Islamic State leaders to release Abdul-Rahman (Peter) Kassig and desist from murdering innocent civilians, a report has revealed. The talks, backed by the FBI, ran for just under a month before Kassig's brutal murder on November 16, according to emails read by The Guardian. Stanley Cohen, a US lawyer who has represented members of Hamas, got clearance from US counter-terrorism officials to reach out to extremist preacher Abu Qatada and Abu Muhammed al-Maqdisi for the mission. But a day after al-Maqdisi predicted Kassig's imminent release, he was detained in Jordan - despite having formal backing from the FBI to conduct talks without arrest. And now US officials deny any knowledge of the email that agreed to protect al-Maqdisi from arrest, the paper claims. Scroll down for video . Plot: Emails reveal an FBI-backed mission involving prominent jihadi clerics came within days of Peter Kassig . According to the report, Cohen - who represented Osama bin Laden's son-in-law - allegedly sent an email to US counter-terrorism confirming that Jordanian officials would not detain al-Maqdisi over correspondence with Isis cleric Turki al-Binali - al-Maqdisi's former student. The aim was to secure Kassig's release - in exchange the clerics would cease to denounce ISIS in public. The FBI paid $24,000 for the group's translator expenses for 17 days, the report states. Al-Maqdisi started WhatsApp messaging with Binali on October 23, and by October 26 told Cohen he was confident Kassig would be released based on their conversations. But the next day, al-Maqdisi was detained in Jordan for inciting terrorism via the internet. On November 16, ISIS released footage of Kassig's beheading. Cohen insists he had secured al-Maqdisi's protection, a fact with US counter-terrorism officials dispute. Cohen told The Daily Telegraph: 'The immediate goal was to save Kassig but we also wanted to set up protocols to free other captives and prevent future hostage-takings. Mission: Controversial lawyer Stanley Cohen believed he secured an agreement with Jordanian officials to send Abu Qatada and Abu Muhammed al-Maqdisi into the country for talks without having them arrested . Plan foiled: The mission fell through when al-Maqdisi (left) was detained for inciting terrorism via the internet after negotiating with ISIS clerics over WhatsApp. He was working with Abu Qatada (right) 'We proposed that they release Kassig as a gesture in honour of prisoners at Gitmo and in Israeli prisons. We were making progress and then the Jordanians arrested Maqdisi. 'Someone in the Jordan or US didn't want this deal to go through. I urged the Americans to pick up the phone to get Maqdisi released. But he remained in prison and the captive was killed.' Cohen will be jailed for 18 months in January after being found guilty on tax charges. Prosecutors say Cohen filed no tax returns for six years, requested a filing extension each year and made modest payments toward taxes due. In September, Cohen's client Sulaiman Abu Ghaith received life in prison for acting as the voice of al-Qaida after the Sept. 11 terror attacks. Cohen argued there was no evidence Abu Ghaith participated directly in terrorist plots.","New York lawyer Stanley Cohen enlisted prominent clerics Abu Qatada and Abu Muhammed al-Maqdisi to negotiate with ISIS cleric Turki al-Binali .

"Emma Czornobaj, 25, had pulled her car over into the left-hand lane of a provincial highway in Candiac, south of Montreal, in 2010 to rescue the animals . A woman who caused the deaths of a 16-year-old girl and her father after stopping on a highway to help ducklings cross the road has been jailed for 90 days. Emma Czornobaj, 25, had pulled her car over into the left-hand lane of a provincial highway in Candiac, south of Montreal, in 2010 to rescue the animals. Moments later a motorcycle slammed into the back of the parked vehicle. André Roy, 50, who was driving and his 16-year-old daughter, Jessie, who was riding on the back, were killed in the process. In court the animal lover said she had not seen the ducks' mother anywhere and planned to pick them up and take them home. Czornobaj was found guilty of two counts of criminal negligence causing death, a charge and two counts of dangerous driving causing death. The Crown had reportedly sought a sentence of nine months in jail and 240 hours of community service. As she was jailed during a hearing on Thursday, a judge also banned Czornobaj from the road for 10 years and told her she must perform 250 hours of community service. According to CBC Pauline Volikakis, the wife and mother of the two victims, had said she wanted Czornobaj to get a sentence that reflects the seriousness of her actions. After the hearing she said the sentence was enough for her to try and move on with her life. She was riding on her own motorbike behind her husband daughter when she say the horrific events unfold. Czornobaj had three years driving experience at the time of the accident and had no criminal record. A  police officer testified at the trial that Roy, whose speed was estimated to be from 113 km/h to 129 km/h when he applied his brakes, collided with the car at between 105 km/h and 121 km/h. The jury was told the speed was higher than the prescribed 90 km/h limit on the road. During the trial, witness Martine Tessier testified that she noticed parked car didn't have its hazards on and that the driver's door was open. She also said she saw Czornobaj motioning to some ducks on the side of the road. André Roy, 50, (center) who was driving and his 16-year-old daughter, Jessie, (right) who was riding on the back, were killed when their bike slammed into the back of car. His wife Pauline was behind them at the time . 'I shouted to my [three] children: ‘What is she doing there? She’s going to get killed',' Tessier said, according to National Post. 'I saw a body go over the car. It looked like a rag doll. I shouted to my daughter to call 911.' Prosecutor Annie-Claude Chasse had a message for motorists. 'What we hope is that a clear message is sent to society that we do not stop on the highway for animals. It's not worth it,' she said. Czornobaj left the courthouse without commenting. According to National Post, she is a financial analyst who graduated from Concordia’s John Molson School of Business where she made the dean’s list.","Emma Czornobaj, 25, parked her car on a highway in Candiac, Montreal .

What you set out to make is in your mind… in fantasy, it is what exists on paper. ‘“Emma [Stone] is going to do this line and it will be great"", then when you do it Emma doesn't want to do those lines as they are hard to do - or the weather was not so great so we have to shift it to a different location because the sunlight is too harsh there. Or it takes her much longer to shuffle the deck of cards than you thought.’ He said that two of his favorite scenes come in Blue Jasmine, ‘where Cate Blanchett blew up and lost her cool’ and Match Point, ‘where Jonathan Rhys Meyers is flirting with Scarlett Johansson at the ping pong table’. ‘People don’t realize that she was only 19 years old when she made that film’, he added. In the podcast he also addresses why in his movies, some of Hollywood’s greatest actors are conspicuous by their absence. He said: ‘For years, most of the films I made starred me. Then I mostly I wrote for women, I worked with all the great women. The guys are great but they are always busy. I have called [Robert] De Niro, I've spoken on the phone to Dustin Hoffman and Jack Nicholson. Nicholson was going to do Hannah and Her Sisters - I wasn't thinking of Michael Caine at the time as I wasn't thinking of an English guy. ‘Now I am working with Joaquin Phoenix, who is a great actor, and Sean Penn. I just haven't had the opportunity to work with some of our greatest - Pacino, De Niro, Nicholson. I would love to work with him [Kevin Spacey] if I had anything for him I would do it in a minute.’ Allen revealed that film investors are kept completely in the dark about what they’re spending their dollars on. He said: ‘If someone wants to back my films, they are told right away that you are not going to see a script, you are not going to be told anything about it, you put the money in the bank and that will be it. Only one in a few are very profitable. I don't think it is a good investment!’ Honest: In the podcast Allen also addresses why in his movies, some of Hollywood’s greatest actors are conspicuous by their absence .","Woody Allen has taken part in his first podcast and it's remarkably candid .

"The family of Jean Charles de Menezes have called for an investigation after the Wikipedia page on his death was updated with inaccurate information by a government computer . The family of Jean Charles de Menezes have called for an investigation after the Wikipedia page on the shooting victim's death was updated with inaccurate information by a government computer. Edits were made to the page covering the death of Mr de Menezes, who was shot dead by a Metropolitan police officer at Stockwell tube station in 2005, an investigation has found. According to a Channel 4 News investigation, users of government computers added inaccurate suggestions that the 27-year-old may have been on drugs, deleted information about his immigration status, and removed a section on his death from a page about the Independent Police Complaints Commission. Changes were also made to pages on the deaths of Lee Rigby and schoolboy Damilola Taylor from government computers which downplayed their deaths, the investigation found. The updates were made from computers using the government's secure intranet service, which is used by the civil service and police officers. The uncovering of the edits comes just weeks after a civil servant was sacked for posting offensive Wikipedia comments on the Hillsborough disaster from government computers. Today Mr de Menezes's family said there must be an investigation into who made the edits, and action taken. 'We have someone sitting in a government office spending time to undermine and smear an innocent man's memory,' family spokesman Asad Rehman told Channel 4 News. 'It's low and it's callous and we have to find out did this person act on orders, and if so whose orders?' The investigation found that in 2006 government computers were used to add suspicions that Mr de Menezes had a 'high level' of Class A drugs in his blood at the time of his death. There was also an attempted request that Wikipedia editors change the reason for the police decision to shoot-to-kill. On the second day of the 2008 inquest into the Brazilian electrician's death, information about Mr de Menezes's immigration status was deleted - making the page wrongly infer he might have been an illegal immigrant. Changes were also made to pages on the deaths of  schoolboy Damilola Taylor and soldier Lee Rigby and which downplayed their deaths . A page on the IPCC also had a section in which the watchdog's handling of Mr de Menezes's death was removed, including a statement that the IPCC had 'got it wrong' over leaks. A quote saying the Metropolitan Police . Federation had accused the IPCC of 'perverse action' in relation to the case was also deleted. Mr de Menezes was shot seven times in the head by officers . who mistakenly thought he was a terrorist in the wake of the 7/7 London bombings. An inquest jury later found . the Met guilty of health and safety failings over its bungled operation . but no officer faced criminal charges. Last month Mr de Menezes's parents (l-r) Matuzinhos da Silva and Maria Otone de Menezes learned the family had been spied on by the Met police . Mr de Menezes was shot seven times in the head by officers who mistakenly thought he was a terrorist . Just last month it was revealed in a damning report on the on . the activities of a now disbanded Metropolitan Police undercover unit, . the Special Demonstration Squad (SDS) that the Met had spied on the de . Menezes family. Officers . from the SDS collected information on 18 justice campaigns – including . those concerning Mr de Menezes and the Stephen Lawrence case – which . resulted in ‘collateral intrusion’ on family members. The . Channel 4 probe also found that anonymous edits were made to the pages . of schoolboy Damilola Taylor, saying the 10-year-old, killed in November . 2000 had 'died', rather than 'was murdered'. And the death of Fusilier Lee Rigby - who was killed by Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale near the Royal Artillery Barracks, Woolwich, in May last year - was deemed to be 'not notable enough' for . an article on terrorism, so the entire section on his death was deleted. A Cabinet Office spokesman told MailOnline that the government had only recently been informed of the issue, and was looking into how to deal with the matters raised. 'Government takes these matters very seriously,' the Cabinet Office statement said. 'We have recently reminded civil servants of their responsibilities under the Civil Service Code and any breaches of the Code will be dealt with. We will shortly be issuing fuller guidance on using the internet and social media to all departments.' In June it was revealed that a civil servant who made offensive alterations to Wikipedia pages on the Hillsborough disaster using Government computers was sacked. The 24-year-old used the secure intranet to change the phrase 'You'll never walk alone' - the anthem of Liverpool FC - to 'You'll never walk again'. It was one of a slew of tweaks that began to emerge on the 20th anniversary of the April 1989 tragedy which saw 96 fans crushed.

'Our position from the very start has been that the amendments made to Wikipedia are sickening. 'The behaviour is in complete contravention of the Civil Service Code, and every canon of civilised conduct. It is entirely unacceptable.' Jimmy Wales, co-founder of Wikipedia, told Channel 4 that in many cases offensive edits made to Wikipedia pages were made by people 'goofing off on their lunch break'. 'We condemn it without any question but I do not think it's some official disinformation campaign,' he said.

"A Brooklyn man has been arrested and charged with stabbing to death his wife and her lover after catching the pair naked and having sex in a parked car. The grisly double homicide played out in East New York at around 1am Wednesday, when police say Steve Whittingham, 48, killed his wife, Jonelle Barker, 36, and 35-year-old Jerome Barrett, according to police. All three worked as baggage handlers at John F. Kennedy International Airport. Love triangle tragedy: Steve Whittingham, 48, has been charged with first- and second-degree murder in the stabbing deaths of his wife and her lover . Bloody outcome: Jerome Barrett, 35 (left), was found lying naked in a pool of his own blood outside a Brooklyn building. His lover Jonelle Barker, 36 (right), was discovered stuffed inside a car trunk . Investigators say Whittingham stabbed his romantic rival and his unfaithful wife in the chest multiple times. Before succumbing to his wounds, Barrett was able to scramble out of his car without any clothes on, stumble to the front door of a building at Louisiana Avenue and Seaview Avenue and try to call for help, but it was too late, reported the New York Daily News. Barrett was found a short time later lying in a pool of his own blood. His clothes and wallet were discovered nearby. Steve Whittingham surrendered to police Wednesday and was charged with first-degree and second-degree murder. At around 3.30am Thursday, Barrett's 2009 Kia was discovered parked on New Lots Avenue in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn. Crime scene: The knife attack took place on Louisiana Avenue where Whittingham discovered his wife having sex with Barrett, his co-worker, in a parked car . When police opened the trunk of the vehicle, they discovered Jonelle Barker's naked body stuffed inside. 1010 WINS reported that on Tuesday Whittingham got a phone call instructing him to drive to the corner of Louisiana and Seaview avenues, where he caught his wife and his co-worker Barrett, who was also married, in the act. When questioned by police, Whittingham claimed that it was Barrett who came at him with a knife first, and that he wrestled the weapon out of his hands. Loss: The 36-year-old was also married. He was expected to travel to Virginia this weekend for his father's funeral . Police say after stabbing Barrett and Barker, Whittingham loaded her body into the trunk of her lover's car, which he later abandoned in Brownsville. But the suspect told detectives that when he took off, his wife was still alive, reported CBS New York. Barrett''s brother, who lives in Virginia, said they had lost their father to cancer just last week and the 35-year-old was expected to attend the funeral this weekend. Now, the family will be planning a second funeral for the slain son.","Steve Whittingham, 48, charged with first- and second-degree murder in stabbing deaths of his wife and her lover .

"Two undercover police officers who had children with female activists from environmentalist groups they infiltrated have been named for the first time by Scotland Yard today. A High Court judge has forced the Met to reveal the identities of Jim Boyling and Bob Lambert who joined protest groups to feed information back to the Yard in the 80s and 90s. Women they had sexual relationships with are suing because they claim the men deceived them - but Boyling and Lambert - who had fake identities - claim that they were genuinely in love. Revealed: A High Court judge has forced to the Met to give the names of Jim Boyling, left, and Bob Lambert, right, who had relationships with women while undercover . Last month High Court judge Mr Justice Bean ruled the Met could not use its policy of 'neither confirm nor deny' (NCND) in response to damages claims brought by women who said they were tricked into forming relationships with undercover officers. The force's long-standing NCND policy was designed to protect the identities and safety of officers working undercover. Boyling - who took the name Jim Sutton - had sex with three women between 1995 and 2000. He later married one of them and they had two children with her before they divorced six years ago. Lambert - who took the name Bob Robinson and pretended to be a left-wing environmentalist - had affairs with for women between 1984 and 1988 and had a son with one of the women. One relationship lasted 18-months. Both men were members of the Yard's undercover Special Demonstration Squad. But after the judge issued the force an ultimatum, the identities of the officers have been disclosed in court papers filed as part of the force's defence to the civil claims, the Met confirmed today. A spokesman for the Met said: 'In compliance with the order of Mr Justice Bean the MPS has confirmed in its defence that Jim Boyling and Bob Lambert were undercover police officers.' The women are among a number of people who want compensation for emotional trauma allegedly caused by officers infiltrating environmental activist groups. Their claims for deceit, assault, negligence and misfeasance in public office arise out of long-term and intimate sexual relationships they had with four men who - unknown to them - were members of the Special Demonstration Squad (SDS), between 1987 and 2007. Denial: The Met is being sued by the two activisits but Boyling, pictured, and Lambert say they were genuinely in love with the women . Mr Justice Bean issued an ultimatum which forced the Met to disclose the names in its defence in order to be able to answer to the claims and had the force not done so within 28 days it would have been taken to admit them. At the time, lawyers for the women described the ruling as a 'devastating blow' for the Met. Solicitor Harriet Wistrich of Birnberg Peirce and Partners said: 'The police have been on notice of this case for three and a half years and until this judgment, they have wilfully refused to engage in any meaningful way with the most serious allegations put to them. 'Their ongoing refusal in the face of an overwhelming body of evidence in the public domain has greatly aggravated the distress caused to my clients, who want answers from the police as well as justice and accountability.'","Met has named Jim Boyling and Bob Lambert who had affairs with 'targets'

"Actress Isla Fisher says she feared for her life when a stunt went ‘horribly’ wrong on the set of her latest movie. The 37-year-old plays a glamorous escapologist in Now You See Me – which starts with dramatic shots of her freeing herself from shackles while submerged in a tank of water. The scene demanded she bang desperately on the glass walls to give the impression of being in distress .  .  . but when her chains became entangled, she revealed that she started to panic for real. Scroll down for video . Gasping for air: Isla Fisher panicked when chains became tangled during this underwater stunt . Fisher – who is married to Borat star Sacha Baron Cohen – said she was unable to reach a safety button that would have drained the thousands of gallons of water in seconds, while a safety diver with a canister of oxygen was too far away too reach her. The former Home And Away actress, who also stars in Baz Luhrmann’s £60 million new version of The Great Gatsby, said she got into trouble after being submerged for two-and-a-half minutes. ‘They had a guy who was off camera, but he was a long way away with a can of oxygen,’ she said. ‘By the time I realised I couldn’t get up and beckoned for him, I realised that I had run out of air.’ New release: A still from Fisher's new movie 'Now You See Me,' pictured with Dave Franco, Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson . Fisher said she knew there was a ‘kill switch’ nearby that would have drained the tank in 70 seconds, but she couldn’t reach it. However, she added: ‘Luckily, I managed to get free and stay level-headed and got out before it went even more horribly wrong.’ She also said that in her moment of panic she thought: ‘Not in a swimming costume. No one wants to go in a swimming costume.’ However, Fisher, a mother of two, said: ‘I don’t see myself as particularly brave. I rely on gut instinct to accept a role. If something terrifies me I am going to do it. The director [The Incredible Hulk’s Louis Leterrier] said to me, “Wow. I’ve worked with so many actors on big action movies, and you’re the only one who’s done all their own stunts.” Love: Australian actress Isla Fisher with her British actor husband Sasha Baron Cohen . ‘I said I didn’t know I had a choice. I thought you just had to get on with it. It’s the Australian way.’ Fisher, who grew up in Australia, spent days submerged in the tank of water in a sequinned swimming costume and high heels for her role as Henley, a female Houdini. But she has previously said she isn’t afraid of letting her glamorous mask slip for the sake of a movie, telling one interviewer: ‘I’m willing to pull a bad face, and to sweat a bit.’ Now You See Me, which tells of a group of magicians who use their skills to rob banks, opens in America next month.

"Police in northern Wyoming say a rifle discharged after a dog apparently stepped on it, injuring a 46-year-old man. Johnson County Sheriff Steve Kozisek says the bullet struck Richard L. Fipps, of Sheridan, in the arm on Monday. The injury is not life-threatening but Fipps is being treated in a hospital in Billings, Montana. Prevention:Sheriff Steve Kozisek said that the shooting could have been prevented had the gun not been loaded . Kozisek told The Sheridan Press  that Fipps and two others were in a remote area trying to move a vehicle that had become stuck. Fipps was standing beside his truck when he told his dog to move from the front seat to the back seat. The sheriff says a rifle was on the back seat and it discharged toward Fipps. 'The rifle was loaded and in the bed of the truck [with some other gear], and the dog hopped up there and either stepped on it or caused something to move and set it off,' Kozisek told the Huffington Post. Kozisek said that the shooting could have been prevented had the gun not been loaded.

"For the first time in more than a century, no American singles players has reached the round of 16 at Wimbledon. The last two of 23 U.S. entrants departed on Monday. First, Madison Keys withdrew because of a strained left thigh before the scheduled resumption of her third-round match that was suspended because of darkness on Saturday. Then, No. 9 John Isner lost his third-round match despite hitting 52 aces, eliminated 6-7 (8), 7-6 (6), 7-6 (3), 7-5 by 19th-seeded Feliciano Lopez of Spain. For the first time in more than a century, no American singles players has reached the round of 16 at Wimbledon after stars including No. 1-seeded Serena Williams crashed out early . Not since 1911 have zero U.S. men or women participated in the round of 16 at Wimbledon, according to the International Tennis Federation. That year, no American women even entered the tournament and only three men did. This year, there were 13 women from the United States, including No. 1-seeded Serena Williams, a five-time Wimbledon champion who lost her third-round match Saturday. There were 10 U.S. men in the field, but Isner was the only one ranked inside the top 65. 'I don't care': John Isner lost his third-round match despite hitting 52 aces and was disinterested when informed about the embarrassing American statistic . Told how long it's been without any Americans sticking around for the latter stages at the All England Club, Isner replied: 'I didn't know that. Don't really care, either.' He could be excused for tiring of those sorts of statistics and questions, which have been adding up. Last year at Wimbledon, no American men made it to the third round. No man from the country has played in the quarterfinals at any Grand Slam tournament since 2011, and the last to win a major championship was the now-retired Andy Roddick at the 2003 U.S. Open. 'Some of this is cyclical. Some of it is we've done a poor job,' seven-time major champion John McEnroe, a TV analyst for ESPN and the BBC, said before Wimbledon began. 'We got, maybe, ""spoiled"" is an accurate word. We expected there would be more (Jimmy) Connors, Pete Samprases, (Andre) Agassis,' McEnroe said. Down and out: Madison Keys withdrew because of a strained left thigh before the scheduled resumption of her third-round match . 'Because of the worldwide interest in sports, if you go back to the '88 Olympics, when tennis became part of the Olympics again, more countries put more money and resources into it to allow more kids to play tennis, so more countries have more of an interest and they see the upside of it. That same thing hasn't happened for us in the U.S.' The Czech Republic, for example, has three women into the quarterfinals at Wimbledon. Canada has one woman that far, and one man in the fourth round. Lopez gives Spain three men in the fourth round, along with Rafael Nadal and Tommy Robredo. 'When you beat players like John, when you go through a difficult match like this, you have to be proud of yourself,' said Lopez, who hit 34 aces and saved the only two break points he faced. 'To beat Johnny on that court is such is difficult task.' John McEnroe, left, celebrates with the trophy after winning the Mens Singles Final at the Wimbledon in July 1981, while Pete Sampras, right, lifts the trophy after winning in July 2000 . Lopez earned the only service break of the match in the next-to-last game with a cross-court backhand passing winner that he celebrated by leaping and punching the air. It was the only time Isner was broken during his three matches this year at the All England Club. 'I just couldn't get into his serve games. For me it was hard,' said Isner, best known for winning the longest match in tennis history, 70-68 in the fifth set at Wimbledon in 2010.

"Menopausal symptoms could be an early warning sign of women whose bones will deteriorate more quickly, it is claimed . Women who suffer hot flushes and night sweats during the menopause are more likely to break a hip than women who don’t, warn researchers. Menopausal symptoms could be an early warning sign of women whose bones will deteriorate more quickly, it is claimed. A US study using data from almost 24,000 older women looked at hip fracture rates up to eight years later. More than two thirds of women going through the change suffer hot flushes – known as hot flashes in the US – and they can last for several years. Dr Carolyn Crandall, of the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles, said ‘Our findings suggest women who exhibit moderate or severe menopausal symptoms are more likely to have issues with bone health than their peers. ‘This is the first large cohort study to examine the relationship between menopausal symptoms and bone health in menopausal women.’ The prospective study examined data from 23,573 participants in the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) Clinical Trial, who were aged between 50 and 79. The study tracked women’s annual visits to clinical centres for 8 years, on average. Women were asked about their menopausal symptoms, including hot flashes and night sweats, during the initial visit. They were then were monitored for fractures during the follow-up period. Almost 5,000 also had their bone mineral density measured to gauge bone strength, says a report published in the Endocrine Society’s Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (must credit). Women who reported having moderate or severe hot flushes when they entered the study were more likely to fracture a hip during the follow-up period than women who had no menopausal symptoms. After researchers adjusted for age and other factors, they found women with moderate to severe symptoms had lower bone mass density at the neck and spine during the follow-up period than women with no symptoms. The menopause speeds the body’s normal process of bone loss, but the findings suggest it may be even faster in women with symptoms. Dr Crandall said ‘More research is needed to illuminate the connection between bone health and menopausal symptoms. ‘Improved understanding would help clinicians advise women on how to better prevent osteoporosis and other bone conditions.’ But UK experts say hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is the most effective treatment for menopausal symptoms. A new review out today (fri) says hot flushes and night sweats affect around 70 per cent of women for an average of 5 years but may continue for many years in about 10 per cent of women. More than two thirds of women going through the change suffer hot flushes – known as hot flashes in the US – and they can last for several years . In the UK an estimated one million women are prescribed HRT in their 50s to replace natural supplies of oestrogen that diminish during the menopause causing symptoms such as hot flushes. HRT is known to slow bone loss and increase bone density. Controversy over HRT being linked to breast cancer, heart disease and stroke led to a dramatic fall in users. But a reappraisal of HRT carried out by experts found the extra health risks mostly applied to older patients in their 60s and 70s, who do not normally use HRT but were given it for research purposes. Younger women can benefit from HRT at the onset of the menopause, says the new review published in The Obstetrician & Gynaecologist journal (must credit). Doctors should not be concerned about discussing the risks and benefits of HRT with women who have menopausal symptoms, or hesitate to offer a trial of appropriate treatment, it says. Shagaf Bakour, Honorary Senior Lecturer and Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist at City Hospital, Birmingham, and co-author of the review said ‘Women are sometimes concerned about the increased risk of breast cancer related to HRT. ‘However, this risk is much lower than that associated with other factors such as obesity, alcohol consumption and later maternal age. ‘HRT is the most effective treatment for symptoms of the menopause and when HRT is individually tailored, women gain maximum advantages and the risks are minimised. ‘There are various types and regimens of HRT and healthcare professionals will be able to advise on the suitability of HRT to any woman.’ Women with severe symptoms were 78 per cent more at risk of hip fracture than those without.","Menopause symptoms could be a warning sign of deteriorating bones .

"Patients with suspected cancer are being refused urgent tests by NHS managers in a ploy to meet waiting times targets, senior doctors have warned. Some patients have their cancer risk ‘downgraded’ and are told they do not qualify for the two-week track. They are then not seen for up to six months. Many are later confirmed to have cancer and campaigners warn that such lengthy delays are putting lives at ‘serious risk’. Scroll down for video . Patients with suspected cancer are being refused urgent tests by NHS managers in a ploy to meet waiting times targets, senior doctors have warned . Cancer survival rates in Britain are notoriously lower than those elsewhere in Europe and this has partly been blamed on GPs not picking up the early warning signs, and referring patients for tests. But an investigation by Pulse magazine has identified that doctors are increasingly having referrals ‘bounced back’ by hospital managers who say patients are unlikely to have cancer, so can wait longer. One, Dr John Ashcroft, based in Ilkeston, Derbyshire, said an elderly man was made to wait two months for a scan to diagnose bowel cancer which should have been done within two weeks. Speaking about a general trend, he added: ‘Absolutely this is happening. ‘If a case doesn’t quite fill the guidance for two-week referral even though clinically you think it is important it gets bounced and you have to make a normal referral.’ Cancer survival rates in Britain are notoriously lower than those elsewhere in Europe and this has partly been blamed on GPs not picking up the early warning signs, and referring patients for tests . Another, Dr Gillian Breeze, who practises in Llandudno, North Wales, said a man with suspected bowel cancer was downgraded to only needing a routine scan in 25 weeks’ time – six months. The patient gave up and paid for the colonoscopy check himself, privately, which confirmed he had cancer. Dr Breeze said: ‘His decision to have consultation and colonoscopy privately much quicker may have changed his eventual outcome, as after a 25-week wait on NHS the prognosis may have been very different.’ Duleep Allirajah, of the charity Macmillan Cancer Support, said: ‘When GP’s suspect cancer or want to access more diagnostic tests it is essential they are able to do this easily and quickly. ‘It’s simply not good enough that some people with cancer face waits of up to 25 weeks following an urgent GP referral. ‘Delays mean that thousands of people with cancer must put their lives on hold while waiting for vital treatment - causing anxiety, distress and putting their lives at serious risk. ‘Each individual hospital has a responsibility to meet waiting time targets. ‘This is yet again another clear warning sign that the system isn’t working and the NHS is under huge strain.’ Under NHS guidelines, GPs are instructed to refer patients for urgent hospital scans or tests to be carried out within the next two weeks if they suspect cancer. Doctors fax or email a form detailing the patients’ symptoms and why they think they might have a particular type of tumour. Hospital staff are then meant to schedule them in for an appointment with an appropriate consultant specialist who will arrange a scan. But doctors suspect that managers at Clinical Commissioning Groups - local organisations who control NHS budgets – are trying to limit the referrals to ensure their hospital hits target and avoids being fined. These managers will have no medical expertise and will simply turn patients away by looking through their form. NHS targets stay that 93 per cent of patients urgently referred with suspected cancer by GPs are seen by the hospital within two weeks otherwise it is fined tens of thousands of pounds. Professor Greg Rubin, who specialises in general practice and primary care at the University of Durham, said he understood why managers were trying to limit referrals in order not to have cancer targets breached. ‘It’s interesting that this is appearing and that kind of bears out what I had heard anecdotally.’ Earlier this year, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt pledged to name and shame GP surgeries which were referring too few patients for cancer scans on the NHS Choices website. Then last month, the health watchdog NICE urged family doctors to refer patients for tests for seemingly banal symptoms such as tiredness, a cough, or bleeding in case it was cancer. But such measures will prove futile if GPs’ referrals are just sent back by managers.","NHS guidelines say 93% of patients given urgent GP referral for suspected cancer should be seen by  hospital specialist within two weeks .

"David Cameron has brushed aside calls for a ‘conscience clause’ to protect Christians who are persecuted for their beliefs. The Prime Minister yesterday dismissed the idea following the scandal over the decision by the state equality watchdog to sue a bakery firm which refused to bake a cake celebrating gay marriage. The cake, ordered by a gay rights group, would have been decorated with a slogan saying ‘support gay marriage’ and two characters from Sesame Street. The Equality Commission is now taking the Christian owners of the bakery to court for breaking sexual orientation regulations. Questioned by MPs, Mr Cameron declined to offer support for the idea of laws to defend Christian beliefs. Instead he told the Commons that gay equality rights are part of being British. Scroll down for video . Cameron has batted aside calls for a 'conscience clause' to protect Christians persecuted for their beliefs . He said that tolerance and equality for people with different sexualities are ‘a very important part of being British.’ The Prime Minister’s line contrasted with his call three months ago for more support in Britain for Christianity and the moral code that goes with it. Mr Cameron’s latest intervention comes at a time of deepening political and legal argument over the rights of Christians. One senior judge, Supreme Court Deputy President Baroness Hale, has backed the idea of a ‘conscience clause’ to help Christians who want to live by their belief that gay sex is wrong and that same-sex relationships cannot be marriages. The gay marriage cake case, which stemmed from the refusal of the Christian-owned Ashers Baking Company to make a propaganda cake for the QueerSpace pressure group, appears likely to extend the reach of equality laws. In the past the law on sexual orientation, passed amid a Cabinet rebellion by Tony Blair’s government eight years ago, has been taken to mean that businesses could not refuse to serve customers on the grounds that they are gay. However the Belfast-based bakery which is now being taken to court by the Equality Commission in Northern Ireland did not refuse to serve its customer, activist Gareth Lee, on the grounds that he was gay. Andrew Muir cuts the cake, made by another bakery, with the Sesame Street puppets and 'Support gay marriage' slogan decorated on it . Ashers Baking Company - named after a verse in the Bible - turned down an order for a cake featuring Sesame Street puppets Bert and Ernie and the slogan 'Support gay marriage' Rather its owners refused to produce a cake designed to convey a message with which they did not agree. Mr Cameron was asked at Prime Minister’s Questions by Democratic Unionist MP Gregory Campbell if he believed the legal action against the bakery was ‘an oppressive threat to religious freedom’. Mr Campbell suggested that ‘such freedoms should be protected by the introduction of a conscience clause.’ The Prime Minister said: ‘I was not aware of the specific case, and I will of course go away and have a look at it. ‘However, I think that a commitment to equality—whether we are talking about racial equality, equality between those of different sexes, equality in terms of people who have disabilities, or, indeed, tolerance of and equality for people with different sexualities—is a very important part of being British.’ The PM claimed he was not aware of the incident but said 'equality' was an important part of being British . Cameron was responding to a question by the DUP’s Gregory Campbell, who said afterwards: ‘There have been a number of cases across the United Kingdom where so-called equality legislation has impeded the ability of people to uphold their religious beliefs. ‘This latest case locally has seen a family-owned bakery threatened by legal action because they would not print a political slogan onto a cake. Such a message ran contrary to the company’s Christian values. ‘It is disappointing that the prime minister would not comment on the need for religious freedom to be protected through the introduction of a conscience clause.’ The East Londonderry MP added: ‘Tolerance needs to be a two-way street, but this case highlights that currently those who cannot support a particular political campaign may find themselves forced before the courts. That is totally unacceptable.’ The idea of a conscience clause was raised last month by Lady Hale, the judge who presided over the most important Christian rights case yet to come before the British courts. In the case, which involved Cornish guest house owners Peter and Hazelmary Bull and their refusal to accommodate a gay couple in a double room because they were not married, Lady Hale found against the hoteliers. But last month Lady Hale made a speech in which she said the decision may have been wrong, that the law may have been too harsh on Christians, and that the law should find a ‘conscience clause’ to allow Christians to live by their beliefs. Mr Cameron’s support for equality is in line with his introduction of same-sex marriage laws. His Government also decided to oppose Christians who went to the European Court of Human Rights claiming their beliefs meant they should be able to wear a cross at work and be excused jobs that meant they would have to help gay couples. However the Prime Minister has also said in recent months that Britain is a Christian country and that Christian beliefs are important. Mr Cameron wrote in the Church Times in April: ‘I believe we should be more confident about our status as a Christian country and, frankly, more evangelical about a faith that compels us to get out there and make a difference to people’s lives. ‘For people who do have a faith, that faith can be a guide or a helpful prod in the right direction, and whether inspired by faith or not, that direction or moral code matters,’ the Prime Minister said.","Prime Minister David Cameron dismisses idea of creating a 'conscience' clause to protect Christians who are persecuted for their beliefs .

"Islamic State thugs have destroyed a collection of priceless statues and sculptures in Iraq dating back thousands of years. Extremists used sledgehammers and power drills to smash ancient artwork as they rampaged through a museum in the northern city of Mosul. Video footage shows a group of bearded men in the Nineveh Museum using tools to wreck 3,000-year-old statues after pushing them over. Scroll down for video . Extremists used sledgehammers and power drills to smash ancient artifacts at a museum in the northern city of Mosul . Militant uses a power tool to destroy a winged-bull Assyrian protective deity at the Ninevah Museum in Mosul, Iraq. The statue dates back to the 9th century B.C. One of the items, depicting a winged-bull Assyrian protective deity, dates back to the 9th century B.C. A man shown in the video said the items were being destroyed because they promoted idolatry. 'The Prophet ordered us to get rid of statues and relics, . and his companions did the same when they conquered countries . after him,' the unidentified man said. The articles destroyed appeared to come from an antiquities . museum in the northern city of Mosul, which was overrun by . Islamic State last June, a former employee at the museum told . Reuters. The extremist group has destroyed a number of shrines - including Muslim holy sites - in a bid to eliminate what it views as heresy. Militants are also believed to have sold ancient artwork on the black market in order to finance their bloody campaign across the region. A man shown in the video said the items were being destroyed because they promoted idolatry . The video bore the logo of the ISIS group's media arm and was posted on a Twitter account used by the group. Yesterday it was revealed how terrorists had blown up the Mosul Public Library, sending 10,000 books and more than 700 rare manuscripts up in flames. Leading members of Mosul society reportedly tried to stop the fanatics destroying the building, but failed. The director of the library, Ghanim al-Ta'an, said that the extremists used homemade bombs in the attack, which took place on Sunday. He told Middle Eastern website Geran: 'ISIS militants bombed the Mosul Public Library. They used improvised explosive devices.' Presumed destroyed are the Central Library's collection of Iraqi newspapers dating to the early 20th century, maps and books from the Ottoman Empire and book collections contributed by around 100 of Mosul's establishment families. Large segments of the priceless winged-bull Assyrian protective deity are hurled to the ground as militants smash it to pieces . Isis first invaded the Central Library in January. Residents say the extremists smashed the locks that had protected the biggest repository of learning in the northern Iraq town, and loaded around 2,000 books - including children's stories, poetry, philosophy and tomes on sports, health, culture and science - into six pickup trucks. They left only Islamic texts. 'These books promote infidelity and call for disobeying Allah. So they will be burned,' a bearded militant in traditional Afghani two-piece clothing told residents, according to one man living nearby who spoke to The Associated Press. The man, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he feared retaliation, said the Islamic State group official made his impromptu address as others stuffed books into empty flour bags. Since the Islamic State group seized a third of Iraq and neighboring Syria, they have sought to purge society of everything that doesn't conform to their violent interpretation of Islam. They have already destroyed many archaeological relics, deeming them pagan, and even Islamic sites considered idolatrous. Increasingly books are in the firing line. Iraqis look at books on al-Mutanabi Street, home to the city's book market in central Baghdad. Iraq is home to a great many culturally significant books and manuscripts . Mosul, the biggest city in the Islamic State group's self-declared caliphate, boasts a relatively educated, diverse population that seeks to preserve its heritage sites and libraries. In the chaos that followed the U.S.-led invasion of 2003 that toppled Saddam Hussein, residents near the Central Library hid some of its centuries-old manuscripts in their own homes to prevent their theft or destruction by looters. But this time, the Islamic State group has made the penalty for such actions death. A University of Mosul history professor, who spoke on condition he not be named because of his fear of the Islamic State group, said the extremists started wrecking the collections of other public libraries in December. He reported particularly heavy damage to the archives of a Sunni Muslim library, the library of the 265-year-old Latin Church and Monastery of the Dominican Fathers and the Mosul Museum Library with works dating back to 5000 BC.","Extremists used power drills and sledgehammers to smash ancient items .

"Wearing fetish costumes, showing off long, toned limbs and showcasing a strut to rival Beyonce's, Viktoria Modesta made her powerful pop debut on Sunday night - as the ultimate bionic woman. But this singer - whose video Prototype aired on Channel 4 during the X Factor final - is no ordinary popstar, she's  an amputee who fought to remove her painful, useless left leg so she could fulfil her dreams of music success. Now the 26-year-old, who wore a shiny black spike as a prosthetic in the sexy six-minute video, is determined to use her body and past to challenge Britain's notions of disability. Scroll down for video . Viktoria Modesta had difficulties in birth that left her leg and hip dislocated. After 15 surgeries in Latvia, she moved to London and was mercilessly bullied at school before persuading doctors to amputate her leg. The video has already had eight million views and includes a beautiful dance in which Viktoria spins  on the black shard that extends from above her knee down to a sharp point on the floor. Yet this clever  routine and glossily-styled shoot masks Viktoria's years of pain, in which doctors told her mother to put her in a home and she endured 15 operations - only relieved when she  convinced UK surgeons that her leg should be removed. She tells FEMAIL: ‘I was born in Latvia when it was still in the USSR and my mother had a really complicated birth. ‘There was doctor's negligence during the birth which meant they dislocated my leg and hip. ‘After that, there were several corrective procedures, including putting the leg in a plaster when I was two weeks old, but sadly that actually stalled the growth of my leg. ‘By the time I was six, there was a considerable difference between my two legs and I had 15 surgeries to try and correct the problem from then until I turned 12.’ Viktoria as a baby with with her mother Svetlana Moskalova. Doctors suggested Svetlana send Viktoria away to live in a children's home, such was the stigma surrounding disability in her home country of Latvia . While growing up with a disability in any country is difficult, Viktoria says that in the USSR, it was tantamount to a life sentence from the moment she was born. After doctors realised there were mobility issues with her leg, they kept her from her parents for five days and eventually advised that she was sent away to live in a children’s home. Viktoria said: ‘Society in that time - they would have put me in a children's home and hidden me away from the eyes of the public. ‘I'm so thankful for my mother because she couldn't understand how society could put such a burden on a defenceless, blameless child. She never let me think I was anything but perfect.’ But although her parents gave her unlimited support, the outside world was much more cruel. Throughout her childhood, Viktoria battled to be seen as anything other than a disabled child. Viktoria  as a young girl (left), as a teen (right, with her mother) was always interested in music . She said: ‘Growing up in Latvia, you can't be a stylish, intelligent person if you're disabled. ‘That was the propaganda that was placed on me. ‘Forget all of the superficial elements like the fact I couldn’t wear heels and skirts, it also really affected my physicality. ‘I couldn't do sport, I couldn't even walk for very long. ‘I was embarrassed because it made people not know who I really was.' When Viktoria and her parents immigrated to London and she started senior school, her problems only worsened as her disability made her a target for bullies. She said: ‘I barely went to school when I was in Latvia because I was in and out of hospital and when I came to England, I went to school for a couple of years and endured a lot of bullying. ‘It was very extreme, I can honestly say there were times in my teenage years when it was very difficult. ‘It was even more of a problem because the teachers weren't responsive to any of it. ‘I ended up leaving school when I was 14 and I remember at the time, social services actually threatened my parents with deportation because they were saying I wasn't going to school, but I couldn’t because I was being treated so badly.’ Viktoria makes a feature of her amputated leg, designing outlandish prosthetic limbs as part of her costumes . It was only after Viktoria left school and started to focus on her music and fashion that she began to gain confidence in herself. She started to experiment with performance art and clothing, finding her sense of style. But the inability to use her leg was a constant issue, making her embarrassed and ashamed. She said: ‘By the time I was 16, I was starting to discover the direction of the person I wanted to be. ‘I had strong interests in fashion, music and nightlife, but at the same time, people would meet me in a crowded venue and think I had some charisma and then think I didn't really follow through because of the condition I had with my leg. ‘It really affected me on a day-to-day basis.’ Viktoria became convinced that the only solution was to have her leg amputated and went to a surgeon to ask for the operation. But she was turned down. She said: ‘They felt that even though my leg was so damaged, it was still my own and why would you get rid of a part of your body?’ Viktoria has spent the last few years honing her craft as a pop singer and turning her disability into a positive . Viktoria then went away for several years and met up with various specialists and people who deal with prosthetics, building her case so that she could convince doctors to give her the operation. She said: ‘These experts told me that my life was going to be great after the amputation, because with the help of false limbs I would feel completely balanced. ‘It felt like a life or death situation at the time. ‘You hear of people who undergo sex changes, where you are living in a body but feel very disconnected with it - it was very much like I needed to gain control of my own body. ‘After a few years, I organised a meeting with a surgeon and presented him with all of the facts that I had found and he agreed to go through with the procedure.’ After her leg was removed, Viktoria says the relief was instant. She said: ‘Immediately afterwards, I felt better. ‘Before, it felt like I had a map of negative history attached to me. ‘I'm sure the morphine had a part to play, but waking up from the operation, being able to move the covers, and not have anything there at all that gave you any feelings, was amazing. ‘It wasn't negative, it wasn't positive, it was a clean slate.’ Since then, Viktoria has spent the last few years honing her craft as a pop singer and using her disability as a positive. As is evidenced in the music video for Prototype, she makes a feature of her prosthetic limb, whether it is bejewelled or a menacing spike. The six-minute film cost Channel 4 £200,000 to produce and was created simply with the aim of sparking a conversation about disability.

Viktoria hopes  the music video will launch a new discussion about people with disabilities in this country, so that soon it  no longer defines who you are. She said: ‘I hope we are very close to the point where people understand that the expectations for disabled people need to be raised dramatically. ‘It isn't about finding someone inspirational just because they get out of bed. ‘I have met several people who work in the disabled community who say that attitude is really quite patronising and damaging. ‘It's about the encouragement of people like myself to come out and say there is a place for them if they are willing to work. ‘I didn't get here by wishing that the world just accepted me, I got here by working really, really hard and believing that the script that was written for me wasn't the one that I was going to live. ‘But I do believe that the shift of power is in people like myself. ‘Because if you walk into a room and act like a victim and expect to be treated like that, then you will be.’ ‘I think the world is generally moving into a more accepting place, but there is a long way to go. ‘It's still so shocking when you see someone with a missing arm on television.’ ‘There is a lot of work to be done.’","Viktoria Modesta's leg and hip were dislocated during her birth .

"A woman accused of brutally slashing and shooting her one-time boyfriend to death in his shower months after they broke up could be put to death for the heinous crime. Prosecutors in Arizona began arguing today that 32-year-old Jodi Arias should receive the death penalty for the murder of her ex-boyfriend, Travis Alexander, who was killed in June 2008. Alexander, a 30-year-old Mormon motivational speaker, was found stabbed 27 times, with his throat slit and with a bullet in his head at his home in Mesa, Arizona days after the savage attack. 'This is not a case of whodunit. The person who did this killing sits in court today and it is the defendant Jodi Ann Arias,' prosecutor Juan Martinez told the Arizona courtroom on Wednesday. Arias, a photographer who had dated Alexander for nearly five months in 2007, has been in jail since her arrest. She has pleaded not-guilty to first degree murder. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Her day in court: Jodi Arias has changed the timeline of events repeatedly but has most recently admitted that she did kill her ex-boyfriend but allegedly did so in self defense . Accused: Jodi Arias, 32, faces the death penalty after allegedly murdering her ex-boyfriend, right . But investigators and Alexander's . friends maintain that Arias became bitterly jealous and 'obsessed' with . him after the break up, and even stalked him in the months leading up to . his death. The prosecution is arguing that Arias . killed her ex-boyfriend after finding out that he had moved on and . planned to take his new girlfriend on a trip to Mexico. 'This love, well she rewarded that . love for Travis Victor Alexander by sticking a knife in his chest. And . he was a good man, well she slit his throat as a reward for being a good . man,' Mr Martinez said. The defense is painting an entirely . different picture of Alexander, saying that his relationship with Arias . was abusive and she killed him in self defense. Travis Alexander and Jodi Arias were involved in a rough sexual relationship before the death of Alexander in June 2008 . Happier times: She met Travis Alexander, a Mormon and motivational speaker, at a Las Vegas conference . 'Had Jodi not been forced to defend . herself, none of us would be here. In that one minute, had Jodi not . chosen to defend herself she would not be here,' defense attorney . Jennifer Willmott said. The couple had met at a work . conference in Las Vegas in September 2006 and began speaking on the . phone every day. Court records show they exchanged as many as 82,000 . emails. They started dating . in . February 2007 and, because Alexander was a Mormon, Arias chose to be . baptised into the church. But they broke up in June 2007, with Arias . telling police jealousy on both sides was to blame. In jail: Arias claimed she had nothing to do with the murder but later said it was out of self defense . In December 2007, Alexander . began dating another girl and allegedly told friends that Arias became so jealous that she . slashed the tyres on his car twice. In June 2008, Alexander told friends he thought Arias might have hacked . into his Facebook account and told her to stay away. Yet on June 4, she visited his home and they had sex before he was murdered. She later told police that they had maintained a secret sexual relationship despite breaking up, ABC reported. 'There's nothing about her that I see in . marriage material - or wife material,' Alexander had said, according to . his friend, Dave Hall. 'But it's hard to say no to a woman that sneaks . into your house, crawls in your bed and tries to, you know, seduce you.' At first she denied being at his . house the day he was killed, yet police found a camera in . Alexander's washing machine containing graphic pictures of the pair having sex. The water-logged camera, which belonged to . Alexander, had been damaged in the washing machine, but the Mesa police crime lab was able to recover images, some of which had been deleted. Among those deleted were pictures showing Alexander posing naked in the shower at 5.22pm, with the last picture . showing him alive at 5.30pm. Later photos showed him bleeding . while on the floor. The camera also contained pictures of Arias posing naked on . Alexander's bed at 1.40pm. On June 9, his friends went to his upscale home after he had failed to return their calls. They found him dead in his shower and his body was 'well into the decomposition process'. Troubled: Alexander's friends said she stalked him in the months before his death and slashed his tires . Missed: Alexander, a motivational speaker from Arizona, was found several days after the killing . Wounds show that Alexander attempted . to fight back, court records show. An autopsy found he sustained 27 puncture . wounds and one gunshot wound, with the bullet found in his left cheek. Investigators also found a bloody left palm print with Arias' DNA on the bathroom wall. Her DNA was also found . in hair recovered from a bloody wall, according to the Arizona Republic. After initially claiming that she had not been at his home that day, Arias changed her story to admit she had been there - but had not killed her ex-boyfriend. 'I witnessed Travis being attacked by . two other individuals,' she told Inside Edition. 'Who were they? I . don't know. I couldn't pick them up in a police lineup.' Scene: A grab shows Alexander's home in Mesa surrounded by police tape after his body was found . Deceit: Police found a camera in Alexander's washing machine, pictured, that contained pictures of him having sex with Arias on the day of the killing. There were also pictures of his dead body . She later changed her story once . again, telling the court that she killed Alexander in self defense after . he became angry when she dropped his camera. She claims he had been sexually and physically abusive throughout their relationship. 'It makes me sick because I know her . true side,' Steven Alexander, Travis Alexander's brother, told ABC. 'And I ask people to please not buy into . this sweet innocent personality that she puts on.' As well as the inconsistencies in her story, Arias' case has been plagued with difficulties with her legal representation.

"Clarke Carlisle's family is hopeful he will make a full recovery after his collision with a lorry last week. Carlisle, the former Burnley, QPR and Leeds defender and Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) chairman, was airlifted to Leeds General Infirmary with serious injuries following the incident last Monday, and underwent surgery the following day. The 35-year-old's wife Gemma Carlisle posted a message on Twitter on Monday, saying: 'Thank you for continuing messages of support and for media restraint. Clarke Carlisle pictured playing for Burnley during his 16-year career . Clarke Carlisle was part of the Burnley side that won promotion in the 2009 Championship play-off final . A show of support from a Burnley fan at Turf Moor at Boxing Day . QPR fans also show their appreciation for their former defender at Loftus Road . 'Clarke still very poorly but we're hopeful he'll make a full recovery.' Carlisle's most notable stint as a Premier League player came during his five years with Burnley, with him featuring for them in 2009-10, their first season in the division. As a sign of the Clarets' support for their former player, fans at Turf Moor clapped in the fifth minute of their game against Liverpool on Boxing Day as it correlates with the squad number Carlisle wore at the club. As well as Burnley, there have also been messages of support for Carlisle from the other clubs he played for, which include Blackpool, QPR, Leeds, Watford and Northampton. The Football Association, Football League and anti-racism organisation Kick It Out, for which Carlisle is an ambassador, all tweeted their support as well, while representatives from the PFA visited him in hospital.

Carlisle succeeded Chris Powell as PFA chairman in 2010 and carried out the role for three years before stepping down in 2013, the same year in which he retired from playing following a spell with Northampton. The ex-England Under-21 international regularly appears on television as a commentator and pundit and has also been a contestant on the long-running Channel 4 quiz show Countdown and a guest on the BBC's Question Time. He has also presented a TV documentary about racism in the game and another - Football's Suicide Secret - about mental health issues among his fellow professionals.","Clarke Carlisle was airlifted to hospital after being hit by a lorry last week .

"Gwyneth talks to Michaela Boehm, who lectures and teaches seminars about tantra . She has shared everything from street food reviews to suggesting water has feelings on her notorious blog. Now Gwyneth Paltrow is taking a leaf out of Sting's book by talking all things tantric sex. The clean-cut actress, 42, chats with a sex counsellor about how to use the ancient Indian form of meditation to create 'wild passion and deep intimacy'. In her latest post on Goop, Gwyneth talks to Michaela Boehm, who lectures and teaches seminars about tantra, about how to re-establish sexual polarity, or sexual tension, in your relationship. Michaela, a yogi and psychologist, tells the mother-of-two - who announced her 'conscious uncoupling' to Chris Martin earlier this year - to let go of tightness and strain in order to 'fall into each other through eye contact'. She says that 'while our bodies are open and unguarded' maintaining eye contact with your other half can be 'delicious (and a bit scary!)'. 'Practice looking at each other, while staying relaxed, breathing and simply noticing when you have reached a threshold where it’s just a bit too intimate. 'Hang out there for a bit and you will find that this can be as good as sex!' she says. But in order to get to that stage, you first need to re-establish the purpose of your relationship and your sexual essence - whether masculine or feminine - so you can 'offer it as a gift'. She stresses that nowadays women are at work just like men, and this means they  spend their days 'in the masculine aspect, making decisions and directing others'. 'In fact, the first thing many women may want to do after work is to get ""full"" again, to get back into their feminine aspect. They might want to do this by having a glass of wine, taking a bath, chatting with a friend, their mother, or their children, or downloading their husband on their day. 'Meanwhile, their husband might want to either get into, or stay in, his masculine aspect - this means that he wants to get ""empty"" or be quiet.' As you both crave something the other doesn't want, neither party ends up getting what they need. So Michaela advises playing up to primitive gender roles. Scroll down for video . For example, in a heterosexual couple, the man can retreat to how he behaved at the start of a relationship by taking charge of planning dates. While gender equality in relationships is 'a great thing, it's just all in the framing,' says Michaela. 'For many women, the idea of coming home from work and being greeted at the door by a smiling, apron-clad husband actually feels disconcerting - even though the idea of a husband who makes dinner is very appealing. The actress is taking a leaf out of Sting's book by talking all things tantric sex on her website Goop . 'What needs to happen to create ideal sexual tension... is for the husband to direct the wife when she steps through the door to have a glass of wine, or a bath, or to go relax and change,' Michaela advises. 'He is directing her to get full. 'Women balk at this, but for sexual tension, it’s essential. There needs to be that separation - getting full and getting empty - before they can come together again fully charged.' Michaela and Gwyneth are clearly onto a hot topic. Almost 25 years after oversharing about his seven-hour long sex sessions with Trudie Styler, Sting's talking tantric sex again, on national TV. The former Police frontman, 63, and his wife, 60, appeared on American chat show, Watch What Happens Live, yesterday, as Sting told host Andy Cohen that the pair still make love 'often', after decades of marriage.

"Smartphones will be sending and receiving scented messages by the end of next year, experts say. The concept is one of ten emerging technologies forecast by innovation charity Nesta to make it big 2015, with others including life-saving apps and food waste feeding millions of people. It comes six months after scientists managed to send the smell of champagne and macarons from Paris to New York with an iPhone app using a device called the oPhone Duo. New technology: Six months ago scientists managed to send the smell of champagne and macarons from Paris to New York with an iPhone app using a device called the oPhone Duo (file picture) The system consists of an oSnap app which allows users to create an oNote with a smell created out of a palette of 32 available scents that can be combined in 300,000 possible combinations. The oNote can then be sent to the oPhone hardware - a device which is able to recreate the smell. Other technology in this field is the Scentee device, which can release a favourite aroma at the same time as a phone clock alarm or when an individual receives a text message. It also claims to be able to change the taste of food with its mini air-freshener-like alcohol-based aroma cartridges. A user can select to emit a puff of scent at will using the small plastic device. City University computing professor Adrian Cheok developed the technology behind Scentee and is now working on a device that will send a magnetic signal to a mouthguard in the back of the throat. iPhone attachment: A Scentee device can release a favourite aroma at the same time as a phone clock alarm or when an individual receives a text message . Nesta project manager Josh McNorton said: ‘Imagine the next selfie you see posted is accompanied by the scent of perfume. The Instagram photo of your gourmet steak dinner comes with a whiff of buttery mashed potatoes. Smell-O-Vision was a system created in 1960 by Hans Laube, and was used in cinemas during the film Scent of Mystery. The system was fitted to cinema seats and released 30 smells at different points during the film, triggered by the film's soundtrack. Smells included pipe tobacco. In 2013,  researchers in Tokyo developed a prototype smelling screen. The smelling screen combines a digital display with four small fans, one at each corner of the display. Smells are stored in gel packets and are released at set times. The smells are blown parallel to the screen. By varying the speed and strength of each fan, the different smells are moved to specific areas of the screen. ‘The olfactory overload of a Sunday afternoon visit to your local flower market can be texted to a friend a thousand miles away. In 2015, I predict that the ability to digitally transmit smells will hit the mainstream.' It has been more than half a century since the concept of ‘Smell-O-Vision’ was introduced to cinema audiences, making its first widespread appearance in the 1960 film Scent Of Mystery. The film opened in three specially-equipped theatres in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles - with the idea being that certain odours would be timed to specific points in the narrative. But the mechanism did not work properly and audience members complained of a hissing noise accompanying the scents - as well as a delay between the actions and their corresponding smells. Mr McNorton added: ‘While we’ve turned our noses up at past attempts, I believe 2015 is the year “smell-o-vision” will finally lose its stink.’ Another prediction is of a huge innovation in first aid that will see ambulance trusts incorporate smartphone technology locating local trained first aiders, who can respond instead of paramedics. It is also claimed that in 2015 enough fruit and vegetables will be diverted from food waste to feed millions of people, through 'gleaning' harvest food that would be otherwise left to rot in farms. Of Nesta's ten 2014 predictions, one of the most interesting is that there would be an 'introduction of services that help us improve our lives based on the data that we give away every day'.","Scientists sent smell of champagne from Paris to US with iPhone in June .

"After nine years a group of Hollywood A-list stars joined Stephen Colbert on stage in New York, including James Franco, who is facing the displeasure of North Korean despot Kim Jong-Un, to sing a rendition of 'We'll Meet Again' in the final ever 'Colbert Report'. The Colbert Report, which started out as a segment on The Daily Show, featured Stephen Colbert playing a satirical news anchor Stephen Colbert and his take on the daily news. Colbert, who had President Barack Obama as one of his final interview guests, stepped down from his hit-rated Comedy Central show to take over from David Letterman on 'The Late Show'. Scroll down for video . Stephen Colbert, pictured, signed off the final episode of 'The Colbert Report' last night in New York . Former US President Bill Clinton played a short cameo appearance on the final edition of the show . Even Star Wars director, George Lucas, pictured centre, joined in the final song 'We'll Meet Again' Stephen Colbert's character was loosely based on Bill O'Reilly on Fox News. Colbert played a very conservative commentator on US politics. Colbert, 50, ended his show's nine-year run on the cable channel Comedy Central without any guests, until the show's final moments when he broke into song and was joined by Jon Stewart, on whose show Colbert first introduced his persona of an egocentric, bombastic conservative pundit. The singing comedians were soon joined by famous personalities from the worlds of entertainment, politics and sports including Randy Newman, Willie Nelson, Bryan Cranston, Tom Brokaw, Katie Couric, George Lucas and Sesame Street's Big Bird. Among many others on hand were James Franco, Gloria Steinem, Sam Waterston, Jeff Daniels, Charlie Rose, Barry Manilow, Alan Alda, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. Before the starry sendoff, Colbert told any new viewers: 'If this is your first time tuning in to ""The Colbert Report"" I have some terrible news. This is in fact your last time tuning in to ""The Colbert Report"" - until 10 years from now when they reboot it directed by (the latest ""Star Wars"" director) J.J. Abrams.' The final episode of The Colbert Report featured a taped interview with US President Barack Obama . Big Bird, centre, also appeared during the final moments for the emotional sing-song . Colbert stuck to regular segments, including his satiric commentary, 'The Word' replete with references to his trademark 'truthiness' and other catch phrases, before accidentally killing off the recurring grim reaper character, Grimmy, exclaiming 'I just killed death. That means I am immortal.' In a final bit, he was picked up from the roof by Santa's sleigh, joined by 'Jeopardy' host Alex Trebek. 'That was fun. OK, OK, that's the show,' he commented, concluding 'From eternity, I'm Stephen Colbert. John,' handing back to Stewart. Colbert is set to take over CBS flagship late night talk show 'The Late Show' after current longtime host David Letterman leaves in May. CBS recently announced that the show will remain in New York. The Colbert Report became influential by highlighting some of the major flaws in the US political system. He formed his own Super PAC, 'Americans for a Better Tomorrow, Tomorrow', which wanted public donations to show how such money distorts the political process. He even announced a presidential bid in 2007, but he would only run in his native South Carolina, where the Democratic Party voted to keep his name off the ballot. In 2010, he held an event with long-time mentor Jon Stewart on Washington's National Mall entitled a 'Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear'.","Stephen Colbert signed-off his final 'The Colbert Report' after nine years .

"Famous for her 'Chelsea blow dry' and bouncy curls, the Duchess of Cambridge has some of the most envied - and emulated - locks on the planet. Her husband, however, begs to differ. The Duke of Cambridge on Wednesday joked about Kate's hair being a 'nightmare' during a private visit to the homeless charity Centrepoint. In light of William's comment, FEMAIL takes a look back on the former Miss Middleton's ever-changing hairstyle. From her unkempt tresses in her university days to the sophisticated style she wears so well today, the 32-year-old has made the transition from long-haired student to glamorous future Queen with aplomb. Scroll down for video . Not such a nightmare! Despite Prince William's comment about his wife's hair, there's no denying that the Duchess of Cambridge's glossy locks are some of the most envied on the planet . Going up in the world: Since announcing her second pregnancy, the Duchess of Cambridge has been sporting sophisticated chignon hairstyles, sometimes leaving the hair sleek and sometimes curling the ends . The pregnant royal started out as a fledgling princess with typically messy 'Sloaney' hair. In her twenties,  Kate favoured effortless curls, often brushed over to one side of her face. Through the years, however, she has adopted a much more polished look. Kate has made glossy, bouncy, curled locks her signature and no matter how breezy it is outside, her perfectly coiffed hair always survives the elements. Speaking about the royal's changing hairstyle, Bruno Marc, Southern Hairdresser of the Year 14/15, said: 'The Duchess of Cambridge knows what works for her and has continued to keep her locks looking luscious and volumised over the years. 'Her look hasn’t changed dramatically, however, the condition of her hair has gone strength to strength with it looking more shiny than ever, especially during her first pregnancy. 'She has the best of both worlds whereby she can leave it down on a day-to-day basis. Alternatively, she can opt for an up-do for the more formal parties with a thick, fuller finish to compliment her overall look. It would be great to see her experiment with a bit of colour, perhaps some highlights to lighten her existing shade - something new for SS15.' Indeed, in recent months, the royal, who has often been criticised for her unadventurous style, has been trialling new looks. Perhaps in keeping with the current trend for up-dos, the Duchess has been sporting sophisticated chignon hairstyles, sometimes leaving the hair sleek and sometimes curling the ends into a low bun. 'The more formal look is a good thing with long hair as it is nice to do something different without having to cut it, especially when you have different engagements to attend as many women do this time of year,' said Grant Badger, Salon Manager/Technical Director at ColourNation Hairdressers, London. New styles: Kate likes to leave her hair down on a day-to-day basis but has been opting for more up-dos at recent formal events . Signature style: Kate has made glossy, bouncy, curled locks her signature and no matter how breezy it is outside, her perfectly coiffed hair always survives the elements, making it one of the most envied heads of hair in the world . Thick and full: Want hair as thick as Kate's? Products like Nioxin Diaboost is a great product to penetrate the hair making it more manageable, free-flowing and full, say experts . Hair through the ages: Kate showed off some grey strands on an outing in November last year, left, but paid a visit to the salon to ensure her locks were back to their glossy best . How does she do it? Even when she walked out of hospital straight after giving birth to Prince George in July last year, the Duchess of Cambridge's hair looked at its best . Shaking things up: Kate wore a natural style on Royal tour in September 2012, left, a pretty pearl embellished bun style in the same month, centre, and even tried out bangs in December that year, right . Even Kate suffers from a bad hair day: Her hair survives the elements most of the times but proving that she's just like us, even the perfectly polished Duchess suffers the occasional windswept moment . Get the look: Celebrity hairdresser Richard Ward, who has worked with Kate, pictured in (l-r) 2012, 2011 and 2012, said: 'Long hair is often in need of more attention. Maintenance is key - regular trims are essential to help prevent split ends and keep it healthy. It’s also important to use the right products; nourishing shampoos, conditioners and masques will help keep long hair feeling great and looking healthy' Oh how things have changed! In her student days back in 2005, Kate's hair was a far cry from the glossy locks we know and love today . So how does Kate keep those locks so glossy and how can mere mortals replicate the look at home? 'The secret to caring for long hair like hers is ensuring you are using the right on your hair, explained Bruno Marc. 'Products like Nioxin Diaboost is a great product to penetrate the hair making it more manageable, free-flowing and full. It also thickens existing hair at the roots. It is also important to not expose the hair to too much heat, so letting it naturally dry and then blow-drying the ends or the roots to create volume or polishing up your natural finish.' Celebrity hairdresser Richard Ward, who has previously worked with Kate, added: 'Long hair is often in need of more attention. Maintenance is key to caring for it - regular trims are essential to help prevent split ends and keep it healthy. It’s also important to use the right products; nourishing shampoos, conditioners and masques will help keep long hair feeling great and looking healthier in appearance.' And, say experts, Kate may have her pregnancy to thank. 'Hormonal changes can make hair revert into one of three of its cyclical stages of hair growth; amongst other changes, pregnancy can make hair thicken and become more abundant in density,' explained Richard. 'You may find also find changes in texture, appearance and even shape.' However, life hasn't always been so glossy for the groomed royal. Like any woman, Kate hasn't been without the odd bad hair day. Kate was photographed with streaks of grey in her usually immaculate tresses in November last year. Like any woman would, she decided it was high time to invest in some serious post-pregnancy styling. She booked an emergency appointment at the most expensive hairdresser in the country, then spent a marathon six hours being coiffed, coloured and blow-dried to ensure she was restored to her status as yummy mummy in chief. According to The Mail on Sunday, Kate spent more than half a day at the luxurious Rossano Ferretti hair spa in central London where a haircut with Italian-born Mr Ferretti costs £600. Given the newly lustrous appearance of Kate’s locks, it most certainly worked. Iconic: Kate's hair is among the most envied by women across the globe - and, say, experts, it's all about giving her hair the right foundation: the best nourishing treatments on the market . 'To recreate the iconic classic Duchess of Cambridge hair look I would recommend you begin with a good hair foundation and by this I mean a good shampoo and conditioner. I would recommend the Sebastian Hydre Shampoo, it is great to quench the thirst of moisture in your hair, leaving it silky and full of body. A good conditioner would be Wella SP Repair Conditioner as it effectively helps to repair and strengthen hair due to its formulation. To create the sleek, glossy, free-flowing hair that the Duchess of Cambridge is known for, I would finish the look with the Wella SP Luxe Oil as it is enriched with a blend of three precious and luxurious oils (Almond Oil, Argan Oil & Jojoba Oil), leaving your hair up to 10 times smoother with triple the amount of Keratin protection' - Bruno Marc . 'For a bouncy blow dry, prep is key - spritz a setting spray like L’Oreal Professionnel tecni.art Pli Spray through damp hair for grip and hold, and a root-boosting spray like The Chelsea Collection Keratin Bulking Spritz for weightless volume. Medium-size heated rollers are ideal for creating body and bounce; finish the look with a hairspray like The Chelsea Collection Anti-Ageing Argan Hairspray for invisible, flexible hold', Richard Ward . 'It's good to use an oil like Wella SP Luxe Oil for a lovely healthy shine and gloss and a volumising spray directly onto the roots, like the Sebastian Voluptuous Spray for extra body and bounce. Blowdry with a large round brush also using something like a Velcro roller to set the curls while finishing the blowdry. After taking out the rollers use a light brush-able humidity resistant spray such as the Sebastian Re-Shaper which is perfect to finish with as the hair will have hold while still being able to move,' Grant Badger .","Prince William joked about Kate's hair being a 'nightmare' during a private visit to the homeless charity Centrepoint .

Booked: Tozser, Deeney . WOLVES (4-2-3-1): Ikeme; Iorfa, Batth, Stearman, Hause; Price, McDonald; Van La Parra, Edwards (Ebanks-Landell 92), Sako; Dicko (Henry 86 - Rowe 89) Subs not used: Clarke, Graham, Evans, Kuszczak . Goal: Dicko 57 . Referee: Graham Scott . The Hornets did hit the woodwork twice in the last 15 minutes but, in truth, an equaliser would have been harsh on their opponents. Wolves had come into the game with only one win in their last eight league games, but they were left wondering how they did not take the lead during an excellent opening 20 minutes in which they caused their hosts numerous problems. Along from the quality of their finishing, the main reason the visitors did not make the breakthrough was down to the excellence of Heurelho Gomes, who made two high-class saves to keep his side level. The Brazilian first showed fine reactions to get down and divert a close-range effort from Dave Edwards behind after being set up by Kevin McDonald, before surpassing that with a spectacular full-length save to tip over an excellent 30-yard strike from Bakary Sako. Watford did manage to weather that storm but shortly after the half-hour mark a fine Sakho through ball cut apart the Hornets' defence and put Dicko through on goal, but he passed up a golden opportunity by sliding the ball wide of the target. The home side needed to change something at the start of the second period because they had been so disappointing for much of the opening 45 minutes and head coach Slavisa Jokanovic opted for a change in formation from 3-5-2 to 4-4-2. Seabastien Bassong attempts to win possession back for his side as Dicko gets the ball under control . Initially it looked like the move might pay dividends as the home side began to at last offer an attacking threat, with Matej Vydra and Daniel Tozser forcing Carl Ikeme into his first saves of the match. But any hopes the Hornets had of building on this were ended in the 57th minute when Wolves got the goal their first-half display had so deserved. Van La Parra was the instigator as he attacked the left side of the defence and got to the byline before laying the ball across for Dicko to convert the simplest of chances to make it 1-0. Jokanovic made three changes as he tried to galvanise his troops to get back in the game and they did go close from a couple of goalmouth scrambled before, in the 74th minute, substitute Odion Ighalo took advantage of a defender slipping to fire in a shot which almost surprised Ikeme as he pushed it on to his crossbar at the near post. That looked like being the home side's best chance of an equaliser until the game entered stoppage time when Ighalo was again denied by the woodwork after being found in the area, this time with Ikeme beaten.

"Most travellers will be only too aware of how onerous it can be sitting next to a screaming baby at 30,000ft. But one passenger’s ordeal was made a little more bearable after the parents of a 12-month old baby came up with a cunning plan to placate angry flyers. The couple distributed sweets to passengers as a pre-emptive strike in anticipation of the infant causing havoc on board a flight earlier this week. Scroll down for video . The parents of a 12-month old baby who feared their child would disrupt fellow travellers on a plane handed out sweets along with a note designed to appease passengers . The gesture was revealed on social networking site Reddit.com by a passenger who received one of the goodie bags from the parents ahead of take-off. The gift bag also included a set of earplugs in case the child, called Madeline, began crying. The passenger, who calls himself Ninjashares, posted a picture of the bag online underneath the message: ‘A baby just handed me this on my flight. I ain't mad.’ The note read: ‘Hi Stranger! ‘My name is Madeline. I will be 1 on December 17th and this is my first flight. ‘I’ll try to be on my best behaviour, but I’d like to apologize in advance if I lose my cool, get scared or my ears hurt. ‘My mom and dad packed you this goodies bag with a few treats. ‘There are also ear plugs in case my first public serenade isn’t as enjoyable to you as it is to my mom and dad. ‘Have a great flight!’ It comes after a similar story in September 2012 when the parents of two 14-week-old twins distributed sweets to passengers in anticipation of the new-born babies disturbing other flyers .

'Brilliant and thoughtful parents handed these out to everyone on my flight,' the appreciative traveller wrote on Reddit at the time, posting a picture of a Ziploc plastic bag filled with goodies and a note of explanation.

'Our mom and dad (AKA our portable milk machine and our diaper changer) have ear plugs available if you need them,' the note added. The idea sparked chatter on the social news site, garnering over 3,000 comments and one million views after it was posted online. Most of the reaction was positive with one user calling it the 'most considerate thing I've ever seen ... it has fully restored my faith in said consideration.' But some thought it was a bit much. 'Really? You don't find this to be overkill?' one user chimed in. 'I don't require an apology for a crying baby on a plane. This is to be expected. I'm OK with it.

"A hiker told last night how stricken soldiers pleaded for water during an exercise in the Brecon Beacons in which two servicemen died of heat exhaustion.

He said: We have them half a litre into their canteen. The said 'thank you' and that they were going to replenish their stock in a stream. 'They said they didn't need that much off us because there was a load of military trucks about half an hour along the track.' Mr Capstick said one soldier was ‘upset’ and asked for water for his colleague rather than himself. ‘It must . have taken quite a lot for the soldier to ask some civilian hikers for . help,’ added Mr Capstick. ‘Well, we know from our own . experience that those streams were no more than a line of arid rocks. There was no water to be had from them.’ A third soldier is still in a . critical condition in hospital, while another three men fell ill during . tests to join the elite regiment’s reserve unit.

"Hollywood star George Clooney said fellow celebrities and industry figures did not want to sign a petition supporting 'The Interview' film featuring the assassination of Kim Jong-un as they were afraid of the consequences. Clooney said he wanted to see the film released online to undermine the threats of the hacking gang, who are believed to be supported by North Korean agents. And separately Sean Penn said he wanted the United Nations Security Council to take action, and warned that ISIS would be next to try to censor freedom of expression. Sony's computer systems were breached following a major hacking attack last month, which saw highly confidential material released as well as a string of embarrassing emails. Scroll down for video . George Clooney, pictured, said the hackers were clever by releasing embarrassing emails between senior Sony executives because this sent a chill throughout the rest of the industry who are afraid of being attacked . Clooney said he did not wish to be told what he could not watch by Kim Jong-un, pictured . Speaking to Hollywood showbiz magazine Deadline, Clooney said the hackers had released the embarrassing emails to undermine any possible support for Sony through the rest of the industry. The 53-year-old described the tactic as 'brilliant', because the hackers humiliated Sony, which subsequently prevented anyone from standing up to defend them. He said: 'After the Obama joke, no one was going to get on the side of Amy, [Amy Pascal, Sony Pictures co-chair] and so suddenly, everyone ran for the hills. Look, I can't make an excuse for that joke, it is what it is, a terrible mistake. Having said that, it was used as a weapon of fear, not only for everyone to disassociate themselves from Amy but also to feel the fear themselves. They know what they themselves have written in their emails, and they're afraid.' Clooney said he approached a large number of important people to sign his petition but kept getting rebuffed. He said that people are afraid of potential retribution. 'This is just where we are right now, how scared this industry has been made,' he told the magazine. 'Quite honestly, this would happen in any industry. I don't know what the answer is, but what happened here is part of a much larger deal. A huge deal. 'And people are still talking about dumb emails. Understand what is going on right now, because the world just changed on your watch, and you weren't even paying attention.' Crucially, Clooney said that, although North Korea is being held up as the reason for the movie being pulled, the reality is different. 'Sony didn't pull the movie because they were scared; they pulled the movie because all the theaters said they were not going to run it,' he told Deadline. 'And they said they were not going to run it because they talked to their lawyers and those lawyers said if somebody dies in one of these, then you're going to be responsible.' '[The Interview] is a silly comedy, but the truth is, what it now says about us is a whole lot. 'We have a responsibility to stand up against this.' Canned: Sony decided not to release The Interview - in which an ailing talk show host (Franco) and his producer (Rogen) land an interview with Kim Jon-un - after all major theaters decided they wouldn't play it. The theaters were reportedly under pressure from malls who feared they would be terror targets . Clooney said that Sony should release the movie online to prove a point to North Korea and anyone else who wishes to threaten free speech. 'I just talked to Amy (Pascal, Sony Pictures co-chair) an hour ago. She wants to put that movie out. What do I do? My partner Grant Heslov and I had the conversation with her this morning. ... Stick it online,' he said. 'Do whatever you can to get this movie out. Not because everybody has to see the movie, but because I'm not going to be told we can't see the movie. That's the most important part. 'We cannot be told we can't see something by Kim Jong-un, of all f****** people.' As for his motivation in standing up against the cyberhack and its aftershock, Clooney said he is trying to protect his own artistic freedoms, as well as those of his peers. 'Frankly, I'm at an age where I'm not doing action films or romantic comedies,' he told Deadline. 'The movies we make are the ones with challenging content, and I don't want to see it all just be superhero movies. 'Nothing wrong with them, but it's nice for people to have other films out there.' Workers removed a massive poster publicising The Interview in Hollywood after its release was cancelled . Fox has already pulled out of an unnamed thriller set in North Korea - that was to star Steve Carrell - as a result of the current hacking scandal. A number of cinemas that planned to show a controversial 2004 movie, Team America: World Police, instead of The Interview have now been forced to cancel the screenings. Team America, from South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, features Kim Jong Un's father, Kim Jong Il, as a singing marionette. At the end of the film, the leader's head explodes. Cleveland's Capitol Theatre said its long-planned Team America screening was canceled Thursday by Paramount Pictures, the studio that released the film. Paramount have declined to comment. Controversial: A handful of theaters across the U.S. have cancelled screenings of Team America - the 2004 puppet comedy that parodies former North Korea leader Kim Jong Il - they planned to run in place of The Interview . The actor emailed Mother Jones and said: . 'This week, the distributors who wouldn't show The Interview and Sony have sent ISIS a commanding invitation. I believe ISIS will accept the invitation. Pandora's box is officially open. The damage we do to ourselves typically outweighs the harm caused by outside threats or actions. Then by caving to the outside threat, we make our nightmares real. The decision to pull The Interview is historic. It's a case of putting short term interests ahead of the long term. If we don't get the world on board to see that this is a game changer, if this hacking doesn't frighten the Chinese and the Russians, we're in for a very different world, a very different country, community, and a very different culture. I'm not sure the world has come to terms with all the implications of the hacking. I was in Liberia and Sierra Leone right at the beginning of the Ebola outbreak in April. It did seem to those of us there that the response was neither coming swiftly or with a true sense of urgency. This feels the same. This matter should be before the UN Security Council today.' Oscar-winning screenwriter Aaron Sorkin criticized the reaction to the Sony situation:  'Today the U.S. succumbed to an unprecedented attack on our most cherished, bedrock principle of free speech by a group of North Korean terrorists who threatened to kill moviegoers in order to stop the release of a movie.' The White House has described the cyber attack on Sony Pictures as a serious matter of national security. White House spokesman Josh Earnest declined to confirm reports that North Korea had attacked the movie giant, which pulled the film after hackers invoked September 11, 2001 in threatening attacks on cinemas. But, in a sign US intelligence believes the attack came from an enemy of the United States, he said: 'The president considers this to be a serious national security matter.' He continued: 'There has been destructive activity with malicious intent, and the administration believes that that activity merits an appropriate response from the United States.' Bruce Bennett, senior defence analyst with the RAND corporation believes action against the hackers is necessary. He said: 'A weak response will only embolden North Korea and lead to more serious attacks, even if it is not proven to be the culprit.' North Korea has denied involvement in the brazen November 24 cyber attack, which experts say could have been carried out by disgruntled Sony workers or by supporters of a foreign power. Former presidential nominee Senator John McCain criticised Sony for backing down, a few days after the so-called Guardians of Peace hacker group threatened cinema-goers. He said: 'By effectively yielding to aggressive acts of cyber-terrorism by North Korea, that decision sets a troubling precedent that will only empower and embolden bad actors to use cyber as an offensive weapon even more aggressively in the future.' Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said this week's events should sound alarm bells. 'With the Sony collapse America has lost its first cyberwar. This is a very very dangerous precedent.' Criticized: Oscar-winning screenwriter Aaron Sorkin (right) attacked the threats on moviegoers. He is pictured here with embattled Sony boss Amy Pascal, one of the worst-effected from the email hacks . On November 24 of this year, Sony Pictures was notified that it was the victim of a cyber attack, the effects of which is the most chilling and devastating of any cyber attack in the history of our country. Personal information including Social Security numbers, email addresses, home addresses, phone numbers and the full texts of emails of tens of thousands of Sony employees was leaked online in an effort to scare and terrorize these workers. The hackers have made both demands and threats. They demand that Sony halt the release of its upcoming comedy The Interview, a satirical film about North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. Their threats vary from personal—you better behave wisely—to threatening physical harm—not only you but your family is in danger. North Korea has not claimed credit for the attack but has praised the act, calling it a righteous deed and promising merciless measures if the film is released. Meanwhile the hackers insist in their statement that what they've done so far is only a small part of our further plan. This is not just an attack on Sony. It involves every studio, every network, every business and every individual in this country. That is why we fully support Sony's decision not to submit to these hackers' demands. We know that to give in to these criminals now will open the door for any group that would threaten freedom of expression, privacy and personal liberty. We hope these hackers are brought to justice but until they are, we will not stand in fear. We will stand together.","George Clooney circulated a petition to support the film 'The Interview'

Benattia had made a frantic call to the police, saying Thomas had been attacked by three strangers when they got out of a taxi outside the hotel. But CCTV footage soon exposed her story as a farce – film instead showed the couple arriving in reception alone and in good spirits, then making their way up to their apartment. Benattia then claimed Thomas was high on cocaine and alcohol, and had ‘accidently stabbed himself’ during a violent quarrel. Awestruck: Benattia is amazed at meeting Kim Kardashian during a filming of her show . Overcome: Benattia bursts into tears after the surprise visit.

Benattia again told the judge that Thomas ‘stabbed himself’ in the confusion, as she desperately tried to get away. Martin Desrues, her lawyer, said: ‘The only version by Miss Benattia is the one that is listed on the record, the only one she delivered to the police while in custody. Passion: The model-turned-TV star has admitted that her relationship with Thomas was tumultuous with 'fights', 'vases being thrown' and hotel breakages . Defence: Benattia has variously claimed that Thomas was attacked by a group of men and also that he accidentally stabbed himself during the argument at the hotel, above . ‘The first comments reported in the media have no value. They were only vaguely reported by people on the spot.’ Mr Derues said that Benettia hoped to carry on with her work commitments, while not commenting on her attempted murder case. She is forbidden from leaving France or contacting Vergara, even via social media accounts such as Twitter, where she has more than a million followers. Benattia was considered a vulnerable prisoner in Versailles women’s prison, where there were fears of attacks by other inmates because of her fame. Feted: The 22-year-old has become a household name in France. Here she is pictured with Jean Paul Gaultier during Paris Fashion Week last July . Suspicions: Thomas checked himself into hospital with an unexplained knife wound to the back in August, telling doctors he had 'fallen on a kitchen knife' while with Nabilla .

"From a glittering pair of golden earrings dating from the 14th century to an elaborate clutch bag decorated with silver scrollwork, the medieval rulers of Iraq were clearly a stylish bunch. Now a rare collection of pieces created for and by Iraq's Il-Khanid dynasty has gone on display at the Courtauld Gallery for the first time. But it's not all fashion and jewels. Other highlights include an incredible brass ewer, created for the royals in the northern city of Mosul, and a delicate porcelain decanter inscribed with flowing arabesque patterns. Incredible: A silver and brass bag made for a high ranking woman in Mosul, northern Iraq, circa 1300-1330 . Although inextricably linked with the history and culture of Iraq, the roots of the Il-Khanid dynasty lay elsewhere - in what is now modern Mongolia. In the early 13th century, the Mongol . leader Genghis Khan initiated a wave of invasions across Asia, and in 1256, . his grandson Hülegü established a subsidiary dynasty, the Il-Khanids, . to rule the south-western territories of the Mongols. By the mid-1300s, Iraq was in their sights and in 1258 they captured . Baghdad, the seat of the Caliphate, and in 1262, the city of Mosul. The . Il-Khanids were enthusiastic patrons of art and architecture and their . cosmopolitan court was furnished with . luxury objects from around the world, including porcelains and lacquer from China, . silverwares and silks from Central Asia, enamelled glass from Syria. Detailed: This 14th century work showing a lady walking with her pages is thought to come from Tabriz in Iran . Elaborate: The Mosul-made Blacas Ewer (left) and a 1330 Mamluk-made glass bottle from Egypt or Syria . Inticate: A roundel showing a harpist at work which appears on the incredible metal bag from Mosul . Mosul . was the great trading city of northern Iraq.  It was ethnically and . culturally diverse with Arabs, Iranians, Kurds, Turks, Christians, Jews . and Muslims, all represented in the city, where various luxuries, . including silks and muslins, and inlaid brass, were manufactured. As a result, the city was famous for the quality of its metalwork, with Andalusian traveller Ibn Sacid, who . visited Mosul in 1250, noting: 'There are many crafts in the city, . especially inlaid brass vessels which are exported to rulers.' And while the . Mongol conquest of the city may have caused temporary mayhem, even for . craftsmen, it also introduced a rich new source of patronage: the . Il-Khanid court. Under the rule of the Il-Khanids, art and culture flourished, with the royal court commissioning a series of spectacular items, some of which appear in the exhibition. Craftsmanship: A beautiful engraved incense burner dedicated to Sultan Abu Sa'id made in Mosul circa 1319 . Striking: A scene showing a Chinese princess and her Syrian lover from the Khamsa of Kwaju Kirmani, 1396 . Among them are two sections of a celebrated copy of the . Qur’an made for the ruler Öljeitü in 1310 and a delicate spherical incense burner created for Öljeitü’s son and successor, Abu . Sacid. Another Mosul-made piece is the spectacular silver bag, bequeathed to the Courtauld by Victorian collector Thomas Gambier Parry in 1858, and thought to have belonged to a high ranking woman at the Il-Khanid court. Engraved with delicate scrollwork inside and out, 14th century illustrations of the court, pasted into an album in the late 18th century by a German bibliophile, Heinrich Friedrich von Diez, reveal that similar bags were commonly used by courtiers. Other pieces include the 1232 Blacas Ewer, on loan from the British Museum and a recently conserved penbox that appears courtesy of the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore.

"A mother-of two shed an incredible four stone in just six months to look ship-shape for when her Navy commander husband came home. Determined Michelle Dalgleish, 31, from Plymouth, set herself a challenge of losing a few pounds while her other half was serving on the HMS Argyll. But when Lieutenant Commander Grant Dalgleish, 35, stepped ashore he barely recognised his wife because of her staggering weight loss. Scroll down for video . Michelle Dalgleish from Plymouth before the weight loss at 13st 13lbs (l) and after, at 9st 11lbs (r) She welcomed home her service husband Grant after losing more than 4st in weight . During Grant's six-month deployment in the Caribbean and North Atlantic, the full-time mother slimmed from a size 16 to a size 10 without telling him what she was doing. Shocked Grant stepped off the ship at Plymouth Docks on Thursday and saw his drastically slimmer wife for the first time. Michelle said: 'I was really nervous while I was waiting for him, but obviously really excited too. 'He had no idea what I had been up to, and he's always said he loved me no matter what my size was. 'I had a skirt on so he could see my legs, but when I took my coat off he was absolutely gobsmacked. 'He couldn't believe it. He kept looking at me and saying ""I can't believe it, I can't believe it"".' Michelle says she decided to do it because with two children she wanted to be healthy and have more energy . Proud Grant added: 'Our Facetime sessions were only with the kids so I never actually saw her while I was deployed. 'It explains a lot. I was absolutely shocked when I first saw her as I walked off the ship. 'I love my wife whatever size but to see her 4st lighter is quite remarkable. It's a remarkable achievement. I seriously had no idea.' Michelle put on weight while she was pregnant with Poppy, now 13 months, a sister to Harrison, four. She decided to slim down again just before Grant was deployed in June, and three days later joined Slimming World with a goal to lose two stone by Christmas. But after ditching the rounds of toast and fatty foods her weight dropped away, and she revised her goal to three stone - and then four stone. Over the six months she slimmed down from 13st 13lbs down to 9st 11lbs. 'I decided to do it because with two children I wanted to be healthy and have more energy,' Michelle said. 'When I was pregnant with Poppy my BMI wasn't great so my main aim was to get to a healthy BMI. 'After pregnancy you have to give yourself some time before you start trying to lose weight - your body needs to be ready for it after a baby. 'With Harrison I did it too early, but I knew I was practically going to be a single mum for six months while Grant was away so I needed to be fit. 'But I had a big motivation in not telling him and for it to be a surprise. Before I didn't want to buy clothes and didn't want to have pictures taken.

"Christmas is normally a time when parents can spoil their children with presents and treats. But one mother has to keep her baby at home over the festive period – because he is allergic to Christmas. Ryan Costello, nearly two, is severely allergic to dairy, including milk and chocolate, eggs and alcohol. His allergy is so severe that if he even brushes against someone who has eaten a chocolate from an advent calendar or swallowed a glug of eggnog in the past 24 hours he vomits, suffers diarrhoea and breaks out in a red, angry rash. Ryan Costello, nearly two, has to stay at home this Christmas because he is severely allergic to dairy, eggs and alcohol and gets ill if he brushes against anyone who has eaten these foods . As a baby, doctors though Ryan was a virus. But allergy and blood tests confirmed severe allergies were causing his angry, red rash (pictured left and right). He was even allergic to his mother's breast milk . Ryan's mother Lisa Costello, 26, who is supported by the charity Allergy UK, says Ryan's allergies affect him so much it is 'heartbreaking'. She is pictured here with her son . While he suffers all year round, problem is particularly bad at Christmas. This is because there are more 'danger foods' around at this time. Last week Ryan went to a Reindeer Parade in his hometown of Middlesbrough. But his hand knocked another child's – and he immediately developed a huge rash. His mother, Lisa Costello, 26, and HGV driver father, Jon Costello, 30, have now asked people not to visit them if they have eaten any of the foods he is allergic to in the past 24-hours. They will be having a special Christmas dinner, with vegetables but without any of the things which causes a reaction. 'It's dreadful,' Mrs Costello said. 'I dread Christmas-time because there is so much he can't eat. He is allergic to Christmas. 'Ryan is also allergic to Christmas pudding, chocolates, Christmas cake, Yorkshire puddings chocolate, cake, biscuit, crisps, yoghurt, pasta, ice-cream, ice pops, bananas, dust, wool, detergents, grass pollen, soaps and even heat.' He gets weighed regularly at the doctor's surgery, and all the staff now have to make sure they don't eat eggs in the 24 hours before he visits. At first, doctors believed he was suffering from a virus. 'But they did an allergy and blood tests at 11 months old and worked out this wasn't the case. The family, who are supported by charity Allergy UK, bought Ryan dairy-free chocolate, but it is virtually impossible to take him out because he was affected so easily and allergic to so much. Mrs Costello, a full-time mother, added: 'I can't even drink wine. Ryan's family bought him dairy-free chocolate for Christmas, and they will eat a 'safe' Christmas meal, made mainly of vegetables. Ryan is pictured here with HGV driver father Jon Costello, 30 . Mrs Costello says she is dreading her son starting school, as he will be around children who have eaten eggs. He is pictured (left and right) suffering a rash . 'I had a hen do and drank some and came back – he started swelling up. I realised what it was. 'As a baby he was also allergic to my breast milk.' She tries not to keep Ryan inside, and loves taking him out, but it's difficult as he can't be near people, or touched by people who have eaten eggs. Mrs Costello said: 'It's exhausting for him. 'We want him to have a normal life but it affects him so much.' His mother has already spoken to the primary school he will attend about his problems, but so far there seems like no obvious solution. 'I am dreading him starting school,' she admitted. She said the rule they had adopted was 'to assume everybody had eaten eggs' and are currently in discussion how he will be able to attend. Despite not being able to eat and do many things, Mrs Costello said Ryan is growing well and is always in good spirits. She said: 'In other ways he is a great height and weight, but as soon as he touches many foods he is poorly. It's heartbreaking. 'He always has a smile on his face though.' Mrs Costello says Ryan (pictured left and right) is always positive despite not being able to do many things other children can.

Statistics show the average wedding costs £18,244, with brides spashing out £2,164 on a venue, £2,770 on catering, £876 on a photographer. An additional £728 is spent on flowers and cake and yet more on honeymoon, rings, shoes and outfits for bridesmaids and ushers. Debbie brought her costs down with a £100 eBay wedding dress, lots of DIY and a family-catered reception for 60 after the ceremony at Llanfair Church in Penrhys. A friend paid another friend to style Debbie’s hair, and she did her make-up herself, while her brother Wayne took the photos. 'It was the day of our dreams,' said an overjoyed Debbie. 'Weddings don’t need to cost a fortune - they just need family and friends.

"A row has broken out after Ryanair pilots accused the airline of putting cost-cutting ahead of passenger safety by forcing crews to fly with limited fuel in order to save money. Speaking anonymously on a Dutch television programme, four pilots said they often found themselves on the brink of making distress calls during flights because their planes were so low on fuel. But Ryanair has strenuously denied the pilots' claims that they are under pressure from management to carry as little fuel as is legally allowed to help keep costs down. Safety concerns: The Ryanair pilots spoke anonymously to Dutch television programme KRO Reporter . The pilots said on the programme that the 'stress' of the situation was affecting their decision-making while at the helm of . passenger jets. When asked by Dutch television programme KRO Reporter if he ever felt pressure to take less fuel on a journey than he would like, one unidentified pilot replied: 'You feel it everyday.' Another explained that the less weight a plane carries, the less fuel it burns, making flights more cost efficient. Former Ryanair pilot Ian Somner, who also appeared on the programme, described an 'oppressive regime' at the airline where he said staff were 'bullied' by management. The claims emerged after the airline was told to carry out a review of its fuel policy in September when three of its planes were forced to make emergency landings in Spain on one day when they started to run out. 'Oppressive regime': Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has denied claims pilots are under pressure to fly with as little fuel as is legally allowed . But the airline told the MailOnline today that the claims, published in the Sun newspaper, were 'false rubbish'. A spokesman said: 'These claims have no validity and originate from a Dutch TV programme which featured anonymous contributors in darkened rooms. 'The reason these anonymous contributors did not want their identities revealed is because there was no truth to their claims.' Ryanair said all its pilots were allowed to take as much fuel as they wished to take, which in all cases was more than the minimum reserve amount. The spokesman added that Ryanair was issuing defamation proceedings against the Sun in the wake of its article. 'Bullying': Former Ryanair pilot Ian Somner likened the airline's management to an 'oppressive regime' on the programme .","Four Ryanair pilots told a Dutch television programme they are being forced to fly with the minimum amount of fuel allowed by law to keep costs down .

"Two soldiers were ‘marched to death’ in a gruelling SAS selection exercise on the hottest day of the year. The Territorial Army pair were among six men to collapse with heat exhaustion in the Brecon Beacons mountain range. All six were flown to hospital where two were pronounced dead and a third was fighting for his life. Two soldiers died in the Brecon Beacons during a training exercise on what was the hottest day of the year, the Ministry of Defence has said (file picture) Around 100 Territorial Army troops . took part in Saturday’s exercise in rugged terrain 2,900ft above sea . level, close to Pen Y Fan, the highest peak in South Wales. Commanders put them through brutal physical trials, including . long runs in body armour while carrying weapons, ammunition and . battlefield equipment weighing more than 100lbs. But, as temperatures hit 30C, the casualties started to pile up. An RAF Sea King helicopter was . deployed immediately along with a civilian air ambulance to ferry the . victims to hospital at Merthyr Tydfil. Expertise: Colonel Richard Kemp, who commanded British troops in Afghanistan, said the gruelling SAS tryout 'push soldiers to the extreme' Last night the tragedy was being investigated by the Ministry of Defence and Dyfed-Powys Police.  The families have been informed. An MOD spokeswoman said they will not cancel any exercises as a result of the deaths, but would not say whether any extra safety measures had been implemented in the wake of the tragedy. She said: 'Routine exercises will continue.' One Army officer said: ‘The troops . are desperate to prove they are up to joining the SAS and push . themselves harder and harder. They are encouraged to by the instructors . who are unforgiving. ‘There is going to be a huge inquiry . into what happened because on the face of it these lads look like . they’ve been marched to death. ‘More should be done to ensure these needless tragedies don’t occur.’ The men, who were seeking entry to an . SAS reserve unit, collapsed  in hills near the town of Brecon. A . defence source said: ‘It is a case of the people succumbing to the . training that they were doing. 'We have health and safety procedures in . place for everything but that must be balanced against the fact we are . training people to go into extremely challenging environments. ‘We don’t go out of our way to kill . people but we have to put them in tough situations because that is what . they will be facing on operations.’ The Brecon Beacons are a notoriously . inhospitable area for army training operations and are used by both . regular units and the special forces. Sources indicated the tragedy was caused by heat exhaustion. A third soldier remains in hospital . The men became ill close to Pen y Fan, which at 2,900 feet is the highest mountain in South Wales . Welsh beauty spot: Army chiefs say the rugged and sprawling terrain helps prepare soldiers physically and mentally for war . Matthew Dorrance, Mayor of Brecon, said the town was reeling from the tragedy. He . said: 'There is a historic link between Brecon and the armed forces and . we're proud of that. In fact, various regiments have the freedom of the . county and Brecon and news like this shakes us to our core. 'More . or less everyone in Brecon knows someone who has served and the . community is shocked by what's happened, and deeply moved.' Colonel Richard Kemp, who commanded British troops in Afghanistan, writes: . Many times during my military service I have seen just how treacherous the Brecon Beacons can be, especially on the rare occasions of soaring heat. This is the ultimate testing ground for British troops preparing for battle and it is no coincidence that selection for the Special Air Service – the toughest training in the world – takes place in these rugged Welsh hills. Military combat demands extreme levels of physical fitness and endurance, and nowhere is this truer than in the blistering heat of Afghanistan’s deserts. British troops have fought with enormous success there and to a great extent this is due to arduous training in areas such as Brecon where fitness, navigation, combat survival and teamwork are tested in near battle conditions. Soldiers are pushed to the extreme, marching for hours by day and night, carrying weapons, ammunition, battle equipment and a rucksack weighing more than 50lb. Commanders and soldiers are all taught about the potentially lethal hazards of operating in the heat, which is equally dangerous in training and in actual combat. Although we don’t know exactly what went wrong in the Beacons on Saturday, the awful reality is that when troops train for war, tragedy can sometimes strike, however well prepared they might be. In January, Captain Rob Carnegie was . found dead on the mountain range’s snow-covered Corn Du peak. He was . taking part in a gruelling 40-mile march in freezing conditions as part . of a selection process for the SAS when he collapsed. Army chiefs say the rugged and . sprawling terrain helps prepare soldiers physically and mentally for . warfare, as well as putting their logistic, survival and map-reading . skills to the test. But the uplands can prove dangerous even to the most hardened service personnel. Major Alan Davies, who was involved . in contingency planning during the first Gulf War, said it is one of the . most challenging terrains military personnel can encounter. ‘On one end of the spectrum you have . cadets being taken for mountain walking and at the other end of the . spectrum the SAS use it,’ he said. Major Davies said the dead men, who . have not been named, would have been carrying heavy equipment and . pushing themselves hard to a deadline. Tory MP David Davies, a former member . of the Territorial Army, said: ‘Nobody should jump to any conclusions . here about what may have caused this, but obviously we all know that, . for example, people who take part in marathons run a small risk of dying . of heat stroke and all sorts of other things, and the British Army does . train its soldiers very, very hard indeed. The training is there for a purpose, and it is arduous training at any level, and sometimes things tragically go wrong.’ The Army’s website says of the Brecon . Beacons: ‘Training for high-intensity, light-role war fighting is the . way soldiers and officers are prepared for any operational situation . they may face – conventional war, counter insurgency, security sector . reform, peacekeeping or supporting civil authorities. ‘This ensures that the training is as . close to current operations and pre-deployment training as possible, . whilst maintaining the ability to train for high intensity war . fighting.’ An MoD spokesman said: ‘The MoD can confirm that it is . working with Dyfed-Powys Police to investigate an incident during a . training exercise on the Brecon Beacons on Saturday in which two members . of military personnel died. ‘More information will be released in due course but it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage.’ The three other men who were taken to hospital were discharged after being checked over by doctors. Saturday's tragedy was not the first time soldiers have died training in the Brecon Beacons. In January, Captain Rob Carnegie was taking part in a grueling 17-40 mile march in freezing conditions as part of a selection process for the special forces regiment when he collapsed and died. The soldier, in this 20s, was given first aid by army personnel but could not be revived and was declared dead at the scene. And in January 2011, Benjamin Poole, 26, collapsed at the end of an 18-mile mountain march carrying a 44lb rucksack and rifle. Fsl Wilkinson, pictured with his step-son, had only recently been stationed in Germany when he was shot . He had been sent on the grueling exercise with a group of soldiers as punishment for littering. On Friday, a Sergeant and a Corporal were given lengthy military jail sentences after a soldier died when he was shot in the neck during a training exercise, in Kenya . Corporal Colin Bell and Staff Sergeant Patrick Price have also been thrown out of the army following Fusilier James Wilkinson's death. Fsl Wilkinson, 21, and a fellow serviceman were manning a general purpose machine gun for more than 100 troops. Bell had taken the barrel of a machine gun that had become jammed and while inspecting the weapon it fired, hitting Fsl Wilkinson in the neck. The court heard that Bell, 29, and Price had failed to follow procedure by failing to call an armourer to fix the weapon. A judge ruled that the death of the serviceman from the 2nd . Battalion of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers had been 'wholly and . utterly avoidable'.","They were training during the hottest day of the year .

"Mohamed Salah inspired Fiorentina  to a 3-1 win at Sassuolo in Serie A on Saturday to keep alive their chances of qualifying for the Champions League. Salah, who joined on loan from Chelsea in the deal which took Juan Cuadrado to Stamford Bridge, scored the opener thanks to an assist from Khouma Babacar, who netted Fiorentina's other two goals. Domenico Berardi, who had earlier hit the post, scored a consolation goal for Sassuolo. Mohamed Salah scored one and assisted another as Fiorentina beat Sassuolo 3-1 in Serie A on Saturday . Khoma Babacar (centre) scored the other two goals and is pictured celebrating with his team . Fiorentina provisionally closed the gap on third-place to four points with Napoli playing at Palermo later and hoping to move to within a point of second-place Roma. The win will also serve as a timely boost to Fiorentina ahead of Thursday's Europa League round of 32 tie against Tottenham Hotspur. Sassuolo remained 12th after what was only their second home defeat of the season. Salah was handed his first start by Vincenzo Montella and the Egypt winger opened his Fiorentina account on the half-hour mark, racing onto Babacar's back-heel flick and firing into the bottom left corner. He returned the favour two minutes later with a through ball which allowed Babacar to get past Paolo Cannavaro and beat Andrea Consigli from close range. Salah (left) was inspirational as Fiorentina inflicted Sassuolo's second home defeat of the season upon them . Berardi almost got Sassuolo back into the match on the stroke of halftime but his curling strike crashed off the left post. Babacar doubled his tally in the 62nd minute after beating the offside trap to bring down David Pizarro's long ball.

"A world where there are no more language barriers might not be too far away - online, at least. Skype has now released the beta version of its live translation tool, allowing people to speak to others in another language - even if they don’t know what they’re saying. The tool translates speech instantly, providing both text and spoken translations. Scroll down for videos . Washington-based Microsoft has released a preview of Skype Translator (shown). It lets people of different languages talk to each other on video calls. The software translates one language into text and speech of another. For now only Spanish and English are available - and you need to have a Windows 8.1 device . You can sign up for the beta version of Skype Translator now on their website. For now the public version is only able to translate between English and Spanish - and you need a Windows 8.1 device to use it. But it will eventually have more than 40 languages available letting people of many countries speak to one another with ease. There's no news yet, though, on when the full version will be available. ‘Skype is now removing another barrier to make it possible for people to communicate irrespective of what language they speak,’ Microsoft’s Gurdeep Pall wrote in a blog post. To start using it, you simply need to choose a contact, turn on the ‘Translation’ switch for that person, and start typing or speaking if you’ve made a call. The programme analyses speech against audio snippets from millions of previously recorded samples, and transforms the audio into a set of text candidates. Speech disfluencies - like ‘ums’ and ‘ahs’ - are removed, and the top choice among the sound-alike words is made, getting the text ready for translation. The technology apparently knows how dozens of languages align with one another, by reviewing millions of pieces of previously translated content. The translator applies this knowledge to quickly translate text into another language. Increased usage and user feedback, plus constant refinement by human transcribers, will also help it get better and better. Skype Translator will eventually support more than 40 languages including - amusingly -Klingon from the Star Trek universe. ‘Skype Translator relies on machine learning, which means that the more the technology is used, the smarter it gets.’ ‘We are starting with English and Spanish, and as more people use the Skype Translator preview with these languages, the quality will continually improve.’ The service works by translating your speech as you talk. It provides a text version of your speech for the person on the other end of the line, and also reads out what it thinks the translation is. To turn it on, you simply need to select the translation setting before making a call to someone. Initial reports from the beta version say it is good, although not perfect. ‘For Skype Translator to work properly, there is a little mental conditioning involved,’ reported Gizmodo. ‘For one, you must speak slowly. Skype Translator's speech recognition is good, and plenty fast, but that accuracy decreases as you speed up in words per minute. ‘""Hey, how is it going?"" can change to ""Hey is going?"" pretty quickly.’ It’s also recommended that the speaker doesn’t ‘um’ and ‘ah’ too much, as this can confuse the translation tool.

An unknown man approached him in the parking lot and they exchanged words. The weatherman managed to back up at high speed and drive out of the parking lot. He crossed the interstate and drove to a group of construction workers, who administered first aid and called 911. Doctors at Scott and White Memorial Hospital in Temple said that Crawford was recovering and in fair condition after surgery for a gunshot wound to the abdomen. From his hospital bed, he spoke to investigators and told them he had never seen the man before. Police have not yet found a motive for the shooting. Gunned down: Footage shows Crawford, 35, being stretchered away after he was shot on Wednesday . Attack: The man continued to shoot at Crawford as he drove away and flagged down help nearby . Hit: The weatherman sustained gunshot wounds to the stomach and shoulder, and a bullet grazed his head . KCEN also reported that police were at the station on Thursday, checking IDs of everyone driving in the parking lot. Crawford's wife, fellow KCEN meteorologist Heather Brinkmann, also revealed his quick decision to drive off and flag down help saved his life. 'Doctors continue to tell me how well he's doing considering the multiple gunshot wounds,' she wrote on her Facebook page on Wednesday night. 'Police tell me that if it wasn't for his smarts to hurry up and drive off and flag down construction workers, it could have been a whole different story. He is truly my hero.' Brinkmann and other KCEN employees also uploaded Superman's 'S' emblem to their Facebook pages in a sign of support for Crawford. KCEN shared the image with the hashtag '#oursuperman' to its own page. Heroic: Crawford's wife Heather said police believe he saved his life by driving off and flagging down help . Attack: Crawford is pictured left with his fellow KCEN hosts on Wednesday - just hours before he was shot . Crawford, who grew up in Plano, Texas and earned his meteorology degree from Northern Illinois University, moved from New Orleans and joined the station in September 2012. He  married Brinkmann, a fellow meteorologist and KCEN producer, last year. The station's news director, Jim Hice, released a statement about the shooting on Wednesday. 'Early this morning KCEN-HD News received the devastating news that one of our own, Texas Today Meteorologist Patrick Crawford, had been shot in front of our building,' he said on KCEN. 'He is currently at Baylor Scott and White Hospital in Temple after undergoing surgery. He is in stable condition and resting. 'The shooter, as of this note, has not been caught. We do not know who the shooter was or if he is connected in any way to KCEN or its employees.'

By Thursday morning, a suspect had still not been taken into custody . Concerns: Law enforcement officers set up near a command post and look for the gunman on Wednesday . Response: Texas Department of Public Safety officers go in a pickup to a command post while other officers look for the gunman accused of shooting Crawford outside the station on Wednesday . Rural: The gunman attacked as Crawford was climbing into his car outside the KCEN studios in Texas . He added that Brinkmann was by her husband's side in the hospital. 'He is a loved member of the KCEN family and our thoughts and prayers go out to him, Heather and their family,' he wrote. On Wednesday morning, just hours before he was shot, Crawford showed off his winning Christmas sweater for the station's 'Ugly Sweater Contest' and shared images online of him raising a trophy. The town is about 75 miles north of Austin.","Meteorologist Patrick Crawford, who was shot as he left the station on Wednesday, helped police sketch the drawing  from his hospital bed .

"It hasn't been the best year for Gwyneth Paltrow. In March, the glossy actress 'consciously uncoupled' from Chris Martin and saw him linked to a string of women following the split. So what does 2015 hold for the  mother-of-two and has she made any New Year's resolutions as she turns over a new leaf? 'You know, I’m not such a New Year’s resolution maker,' she explains. 'Everyday I try to resolve to do the things that I would like to do or be more of the person I would like to be, but I don’t, I don’t make like a big resolution, because I think that’s a way to break a promise to yourself and fail and fail bad.' Scroll down for video . Getting into the Christmas spirit: Gwyneth Paltrow, 42, is the face of Boss Ma Vie Pour Femme fragrance and shares her plans for the festive season . Rather than look to the future, the clean-cut actress is focusing on enjoying time with her family over the festive period. 'I really love spending the holidays anywhere as long as it’s with people that I love,' she said of her Christmas plans. 'I don’t mind if it’s a city Christmas or a country Christmas just as long as I’ve got my people with me.' Discussing gifting, the actress and author, who recently compiled a present guide featuring diamond-shaped vases and a gold-plated juicer, added: 'When I’m giving gifts I definitely like them to be a surprise, absolutely. And I manage until the end. I’m a good secret keeper.'

Sharing her style tips for pulling off the season in style, the fashionista said: 'I think every woman should own a blacktuxedo jacket. It’s so versatile and a really key staple piece in a wardrobe. And if it’s well tailored it’s so feminine while being a strong shape.' The star, who is the face of Boss Ma Vie Pour Femme fragrance, and smoulders in the new campaign images, explains: 'I would style a tuxedo similar to the way we have done it in the campaign; I love that there’s a white silk scarf with it and very high heels. And the tuxedo is tailored. I like that it’s a low-V so you have some skin; that makes it feminine.' Big fan: As the face of the brand, she obviously loves the new Boss fragrance, particularly because it represents a time to pause and take a moment, she explains . Beauty-wise, Gwyneth explains that she prefers an undone, smudgy, smoky eye because, she says, it makes her eyes 'go very blue'. 'It’s a look you see a lot in London. Although for a special occasion I love a strong lip - the Marilyn Monroe colour is beautiful,' said Gwyneth. As the face of the brand, she obviously loves the new Boss fragrance - and not just for its scent. 'I love the concept behind it and that it represents a time to pause and take a moment,' she said.

"When Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick sits down to field calls on his monthly Boston Public Radio phone in, he usually expects  to be the most powerful person on the phone. But then he got a call from an altogether unexpected guest. 'Uh, Governor, this is Barack Obama, formerly of Somerville,' the mysterious caller told BPR's Ask The Governor. 'I've got a few complaints about service in and around the neighborhood, but I've moved down South since that time...' At first, a somewhat bewildered Gov. Patrick assumed it was a hoax, responding: 'You're kidding, Mr. President. Who is this impersonator? You're very good. Who is this really?' Scroll down for video . Surprise: Gov. Patrick (left) was fielding calls from listeners when a mystery guest turned out to be President Barack Obama wishing him well after life as Massachusetts' governor . Good friends: The state's first black governor, Patrick himself has been mentioned as a possible future White House contender, though he has ruled out a bid in 2016 . Courtesy of WGBH News: Boston Public Radio . But within a few moments, he realised it was in fact the real President of the United States of America, referring to the Boston suburb where Mr Obama lived while studying law at Harvard University. It brought a humorous end to Gov. Patrick's tenure as head of the executive branch of Massachusetts' state government, a position he will leave in the new year. For the past eight years, Patrick has joined Jim Braude and Margery Eagan on the radio each month to field calls from listeners. And yesterday's show was his final chance to bid his supporters farewell. During the call, Mr Obama went on to wish him well upon leaving his post, telling him: 'I want to find out how it is that you got Massachusetts so strong and moving in the right direction.' Barack Obama: 'Hello?' Jim Braude: 'Hello, sir. Yes, you're on with Gov. Deval Patrick.' Barack Obama: 'Uh, Governor, this is Barack Obama, formerly of Somerville. I've got a few complaints about service in and around the neighborhood, but I've moved down South since that time...' Deval Patrick: 'You're kidding, Mr. President. Who is this impersonator? You're very good. Who is this really?' Barack Obama: 'I want to find out how it is that you got Massachusetts so strong and moving in the right direction.' Deval Patrick: 'Mr. President, you know I love you, but you still have trouble saying Massachusetts. You know that don't you?' Barack Obama: 'You know, there's a little lisp thing that develops when I say Massachusetts.I know how to spell it, though.' Deval Patrick: 'Indeed you do. And you know where it is. You've been a great friend to all of us. Thank you.' For the full recording of the conversation, watch the video above. But rather than accept the honour gracefully, he decided instead to goad Obama for his inability to pronounce the name of his state. 'Mr. President, you know I love you, but you still have trouble saying Massachusetts,' he said. 'You know that don't you?' Obama joked back: 'You know, there's a little lisp thing that develops when I say Massachusetts. I know how to spell it, though.' He went on to tell him: 'I just wanted to call in and let my dear friend know how proud I am. Deval, you've done good, man.' The conversation turned to Patrick's achievements, as Mr Obama lauded an increased health care access, student education, clean energy, and even the Boston Red Sox's two championships under Gov. Patrick's governorship. 'Should I take credit for that, too?' Patrick said. 'You started with an outstanding state, but you have burnished it and polished it and, most importantly, you have gotten people involved,' the president said. The governor said those words meant a lot to him. The state's first black governor, Patrick himself has been mentioned as a possible future White House contender, though he has ruled out a bid in 2016. The hosts didn't let Obama off unscathed, though. 'Mr. President, you paid all those parking tickets in Somerville, correct?' referring to 17 parking tickets Obama received when he lived in Cambridge and Somerville while attending Harvard Law School. 'I think I had to before I took office,' Mr Obama replied. 'Otherwise I wouldn't have been able to step into the Commonwealth without being arrested.'","Governor Deval Patrick was conducting final show on Boston Public Radio .

"It’s set to be one of the most groundbreaking moments in humanity’s six decades of space exploration: Today SpaceX was due to land a rocket on a floating platform after launching. But those looking forward to this pivotal moment will have to wait a little longer, as Nasa has announced that the launch will be delayed until 6 January 2015. Nasa said the delay will allow a few issues with the rocket to be ironed out - and it will also give the teams time ‘to enjoy the holidays’. Scroll down for videos . SpaceX was planning to land a Falcon 9 rocket on a barge (shown) at Cape Canaveral today. The rocket was to attempt to land after launching a Dragon capsule. But the launch has been delayed until Tuesday 6 Jan due to an issue with one of the engines. It had already been delayed from earlier this week due to the same issue . The launch of the Falcon 9 rocket had originally been scheduled for Monday this week from Cape Canaveral in Florida. However, the launch was delayed to today when some issues arose during a static fire test - which involves a brief ignition of the rocket’s nine engines on the launchpad to test they work. And it seems the issues haven’t quite been solved yet, so Nasa is playing it safe and aiming for a later launch. The Falcon 9 rocket carrying Dragon will take off from Florida’s Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. After launch, at a height of about 56 miles (90km), the first stage of the rocket will separate from the second stage. While the latter continues its mission into orbit, the former would usually be left to fall back into the ocean - as is the case on all other rocket launches. This is a costly operation causing the price of launches to top £280 million ($440 million). SpaceX, however, is attempting to develop rockets that can make soft landings back on Earth so they can be recovered and recycled. This could bring the cost of launching to space down by at least a factor of ten - making it much more accessible. The reason the delay is so long, until January, is that the ISS is moving into a period of increased sunlight. For 10 days from 28 December to 7 January, the station is in almost constant light. This prohibits Dragon from berthing with the station, as temperatures are too high. The launch is now scheduled for 11.18am GMT (6:18am EST) on Tuesday 6 January, with a backup attempt available the following day. If all goes to plan, Dragon will then rendezvous with the ISS at 11am GMT (6am EST) on Thursday 8 January. ‘Nasa and SpaceX announced today the launch of SpaceX’s fifth commercial resupply services mission to the International Space Station now will occur no earlier than Tuesday 6 January,’ Nasa announced yesterday in a statement. ‘This will provide SpaceX engineers time to investigate further some of the issues that arose from the static fire test of the Falcon 9 rocket on 16 December.’ They added: 'The new launch date also will allow the teams to enjoy the holidays.' The incredible attempt will occur during the launch of the latest cargo-carrying Dragon capsule to the ISS, called the CRS-5 mission, from Florida’s Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Pictured is a previous Falcon 9 launch on 14 July 2014 - when SpaceX tested the ability of the rocket to land, but over the ocean . The first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket will attempt to touch down on a barge (illustration shown) after launching a Dragon capsule into space. It is the first ever attempt at landing a rocket on solid ground after launch, and could herald a new era of cheaper spaceflight . This launch of the Falcon 9 is carrying SpaceX’s unmanned Dragon capsule on its fifth scheduled cargo mission to the ISS - and sixth flight to the station overall - under contract with Nasa. But while that is an achievement in itself, of more interest is SpaceX’s plan after the launch. The various stages of rockets are normally left to fall into the ocean or burn up in the atmosphere after reaching space. SpaceX, though, wants to eventually make entire rockets reusable - like an airplane - allowing them to launch, land and then launch again. This mission will be a crucial step in that endeavour. Already the company has tested the technology to land a rocket in a series of tests using the Grasshopper concept vehicle. This was a rocket attached with landing legs that performed short ‘hops’ on Earth, to a height of a few hundred metres, to test the technology needed to land. And this time that same technology will be used to bring the rocket back from the edge of space. For now SpaceX is attempting to return only the first stage - the lower portion - of a rocket after launching. In future, they are hoping to return the entire rocket to ground. On a previous launch to space on 14 July this year, the company employed ‘grid fins’ on the first stage of a Falcon 9 rocket, allowing it to remain stable on its return to Earth. Shortly before hitting the ocean it also reignited its thrusters, to prove that the rocket could successfully turn itself back on and perform a landing. Grid fins (seen here) on the side of the first stage of the rocket will keep it steady as it descends to Earth, while it will save 15 per cent of its initial fuel in order to lower itself slowly to the ground . On this occasion the rocket, after performing this test, simply fell into the ocean. But SpaceX has constructed a floating barge for this next launch, upon which the rocket will attempt to land. CEO Elon Musk notes that the attempt, as it is the first, only has a 50 per cent chance of success. Nonetheless, regardless if it fails or succeeds, the test will be important to one day making all of their launches reusable. ‘Returning anything from space is a challenge, but returning a Falcon 9 first stage for a precision landing presents a number of additional hurdles,’ the company said in a statement. ‘At 14 stories tall and traveling upwards of 1,300 metres (nearly one mile) per second, stabilising the Falcon 9 first stage for re-entry is like trying to balance a rubber broomstick on your hand in the middle of a wind storm.’ Elon Musk (pictured) said the ambitious attempt has a 50 per cent chance of working. SpaceX ultimately wants all of its rockets to be reusable in order to reduce the cost of going to space . The barge measures about 300 feet (90 metres) long by 100 feet (30 metres) wide, and also has wings that extend out to another 170 feet (50 metres). According to SpaceX chief Elon Musk, it also has ‘thrusters repurposed from deep sea oil rigs’ that can hold it in position within 10 feet (three metres) even in a storm. To control the rocket as it lands, the grid fins on its side control its pitch, yaw and roll. These are ‘stowed on ascent and then deploy on re-entry for “X-Wing” [from Star Wars] style control,’ according to Musk. And to slow it down as it descends it will save 15 per cent of its original fuel, allowing it to lower itself towards the ocean without the use of a parachute. The barge (shown) measures about 300 feet (90 metres) long by 100 feet (30 metres) wide, and also has wings that extend out to another 170 feet (50 metres) Whatever the outcome, SpaceX will use the data they glean to improve their technique and one day plan to perform this manoeuvre during every launch. Cameras on board the barge will capture the entire descent, although it’s unclear how much - if any - of this footage SpaceX will make public. Eventually, they will start bringing the upper - or second - stage of the rocket back as well. The ultimate goal is to make the entire rocket reusable - which will drastically reduce the cost of going to space. SpaceX has a £1billion ($1.6 billion) contract with Nasa to resupply the ISS. This launch of the Dragon capsule will be the fifth of 12 scheduled missions. This launch of the Falcon 9 will be carrying SpaceX’s unmanned Dragon capsule on its fifth scheduled cargo mission to the ISS - and sixth flight to the station overall - under contract with Nasa.

"North Korea sent special forces teams to the US in the 1990s to target nuclear power stations and conduct terror attacks on major cities in the event of war, a declassified intelligence report has revealed. The rogue state successfully infiltrated five units of highly-trained commandos onto U.S. soil ready to strike at key installations, according to a Defense Intelligence Agency report dated September 13, 2004. The report states that the North Korean Ministry of People’s Armed Forces 'established five liaison offices in the early 1990s, to train and infiltrate operatives into the United States to attack nuclear power plants and major cities in case of hostilities.' Scroll down for video . Threat: A North Korean commando pictured during a training exercise earlier this year. North Korea sent five commando units to the US during the 1990s according to a declassified report . They 'had agents in place to attack American nuclear power plants', it continues, 'in the event of hostilities between the United States and DPRK'. Military experts believe that the commando units were brought in because at the time North Korea lacked any long-range missiles capable of hitting the U.S. The report adds: 'One of the driving forces behind the establishment of the units and infiltration of operatives was the slow progress in developing a multi-stage ballistic missile.' The rogue state was then under the control of Kim Jong il . Today the rogue state is believed to have at least two types of long-range ballistic missile  capable of reaching the U.S. North Korea has one of the largest number of Special Forces in the world with more than 60,000 commandos under control of the shadowy Reconnaissance Bureau, part of the country’s Armed Forces. The Bureau is known to have been behind a string of terror attacks over the years including airline bombing, kidnaps and assassinations. The source of the information is not disclosed but may have come from a defector or electronic surveillance. The redacted document was recently released thorough a Freedom of Information Act request, the Washington Free Beacon reports. It comes after hackers, believed to be working on behalf of North Korea, successfully forced Sony to withdraw a comedy film about a plot to assassinate Kim Jong un. The Interview, which depicts a catastrophic attempt to assassinate the North Korean dictator, will not be shown in cinemas and is understood to have been shelved indefinitely. The hackers, who are believed to work for a sophisticated cyber-warfare cell called Bureau 121, issued a a terrifying warning to American audiences, telling them to ‘remember September 11, 2001’. They stole an estimated 100 terabytes of data including unreleased films and could cost the movie studio hundreds of millions of dollars. The release of the report comes after hackers, believed to be working on behalf of North Korea, successfully forced Sony to withdraw the comedy film the Interview (pictured) about a plot to assassinate Kim Jong un . The U.S. government said yesterday it was weighing the proportional response to the sophisticated perpetrator of a cyberattack that crippled Sony Pictures, exposed its executives and led to the cancellation of the film 'The Interview.' Spokesman Josh Earnest said the White House is not in a position to confirm that North Korea is responsible for the hack at Sony, after a US official said Wednesday that Washington may soon formally announce the involvement of the Pyongyang government. The effect of any response, such as cyber retaliation or financial sanctions, could be limited, U.S. experts said.","Rogue state had five commando units on US soil .

"Rangers fans took their objections over Mike Ashley’s growing influence in Ibrox affairs to the tycoon’s Sports Direct stores in a ‘symbolic’ protest on Saturday. Supporters affiliated to the Sons Of Struth group and other Union Of Fans organisations disrupted business at shops throughout the country during lunchtime trading. And Craig Houston, founder of SOS, suggested that further ‘flash mob’ action will be taken to the tills of Ashley’s interests in weeks to come. Rangers fans outside one of Mike Ashley's Sports Direct stores in Glasgow . A Rangers fan sees what he can get for £1 in a Glasgow Sports Direct store . The centrepiece of the disruption was staged at the Glasgow Fort complex where fans went on to target the clothing shop Cruise, also owned by the billionaire businessman who was able to buy naming rights for Ibrox Stadium for £1 from former Rangers chief executive Charles Green. The campaigners want Ashley, who has a stranglehold on the club’s retail contracts and owns 8.9 per cent of Rangers shares, to rip up his right to activate a renaming of Ibrox Stadium. Houston said: 'Over 100 Rangers fans staged a protest outside the shop then went into the store to pick up items, some expensive and some normal. 'They were ran through the till and, when told the value of the transaction, each supporter offered £1. That, of course, is significant because it’s the same amount at which Mike Ashley values the name of Ibrox. 'The symbolic part is that he values his golf clubs, t-shirts or whatever other sporting goods he sells at far greater than the name of our club’s stadium. 'We were in the store for just under an hour and we also shut off tills in Cruise for half an hour after that. Newcastle owner Mike Ashley (right) has come under pressure for his increasing influence at Rangers . Scores of fans lined up to tell Ashley 'enough is enough give us our club back' 'We know Mike Ashley knows about it because there was extra security at stores around the country so it’s also cost him money to man the shops.' Ashley’s increasing interest in Rangers – backed by football board chairman Sandy Easdale – is regarded as a matter of extreme concern by supporters. He is seen as the threat to any hope of a Rangers fans’ buyout from Dave King, George Letham and Paul Murray who have been in talks with chief executive Graham Wallace over a £16 million bail-out. The Newcastle United owner has called for an extraordinary meeting in an effort to push through the removal of Wallace and boardroom ally, finance director Philip Nash. Union of Fans, the supporters’ umbrella group, has sought to oppose Ashley’s power grab and EGM call by urging the Scottish Football Association to take action on what they perceive to be a breach of dual ownership rules. Fans are angry that ex-chief executive Charles Green sold Ashley naming rights to Ibrox for just £1 . A strong Rangers contingent flocked to Sports Direct shops to protest against Ashley . Ashley has an agreement with the SFA limiting him to a stake of no more than 10 per cent in Rangers while he is in control of Newcastle. But the articles of association at Hampden state that no one individual involved in another club ‘has any power whatsoever to influence the management or administration of a club’ without prior written consent. SOS organiser Houston expects Rangers supporters to step up their hostility to Ashley in the weeks ahead while turning on the current unpopular board of the club in upcoming home fixtures. They have implored fans to attend the Armed Forces Day when Raith Rovers visit Ibrox on Saturday and call for the removal of Sandy Easdale – then stage a boycott for the League Cup tie against St Johnstone on Tuesday, October 28. “The general feeling was one of delight at how the Sports Direct protest went,” said Houston. “We’ll give it a couple of free days to see if there’s any response from Sports Direct and, if there is none, then we will maybe replicate the protests - and we’d expect numbers to be greater if we have to repeat these actions. We’re asking fans to have a one match boycott at the end of the month and we’ll have activities planned for that St Johnstone match and other home games.” The club's supporters have made it clear that Ashley's input is not wanted in Glasgow .","Supporters affiliated to the Sons of Struth group disrupted Sports Direct businesses during Saturday lunchtime trading .

"After Sony yanked North Korean satire 'The Interview' from theaters, several small houses announced plans to show 'Team America' - another film featuring a North Korean leader - in an attempt to spite the hermit regime. However, Paramount Pictures has now put the kibosh on the screenings - sending out messages barring the cinemas from showing the movie. One of the theaters, the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema said; 'Due to to circumstances beyond our control, the TEAM AMERICA 12/27 screening has been cancelled. We apologize & will provide refunds today.' Paramount however has yet to make any comment on their decision to not allow cinemas to show the film. Scroll down for video . 'Team America: World Police' features the previous leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-il as a singing marionette that gets impaled on a spike and is later revealed to be a space alien . North Korea called 'The Interview' and 'act of war' for portraying the assassination and violent death of its current leader, Kim Jong-un - who took over after his father's death . While 'The Interview' shows currently leader Kim Jong-un being assassinated in a gory fashion, 'Team America: World Police' depicts a marionette version of his father, Kim Jong-il.

"The White House refused on Thursday to publicly incriminate North Korea in a cyber hack on computers at Sony Pictures, even though senior U.S. officials have already indicated in private that the country was 'centrally involved.' The president's spokesman instead claimed that the 'destructive activity with malicious intent' was carried out 'by a sophisticated actor.' 'I am not in a position to confirm any attribution at this point,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said. He promised that the Obama administration was taking the matter 'seriously,' however, and that investigators are 'mindful of the fact that we need a proportional response.' He also revealed that retaliatory actions may be kept secret. Scroll down for video . White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on Thursday that President Barack Obama considers the recent Sony hacking 'a serious national security matter' and that it is still under investigation. He would not implicate North Korea in the attack, though senior administration officials have already told the press that they know the country was 'centrally involved' The New York Times had reported earlier in the day that senior administration officials had acknowledged to the news publication that North Korea was behind the breach of Sony computers that wiped data and exposed employees' personal information, including their emails. The matter escalated to a national security issue after hackers sent news organizations a message warning of terrorist-style attacks on movie theaters that showed Seth Rogen and James Franco's forthcoming film The Interview. 'Remember the 11th of September 2001,' the message said. 'We recommend you to keep yourself distant from the places at that time.' The cyber terrorists specifically threatened 'the very times and places' the Interview was to be shown. The Interview features Franco and Rogen as journalists who are recruited by the CIA to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The film was set for release in the U.S. on Dec. 25, but several major theater chains said this week they would not show the movie in light of the menacing messages. On Wednesday Sony cancelled the theatrical release of the film entirely, citing the 'decision by the majority of our exhibitors not to show the film.' 'We respect and understand our partners' decision and, of course, completely share their paramount interest in the safety of employees and theater-goers,' it said in a statement. North Korea has said it is not responsible for the cyber attack, despite promising 'merciless counter-measures' this summer if the United States government allowed the film to be released. In its denial it also 'called upon the world to turn out in the just struggle to put an end to U.S. imperialism, the chieftain of aggression and the worst human rights abuser' and stated that the U.S. should 'know that there are a great number of supporters and sympathizers with the [Democratic People's Republic of Korea] all over the world.' The state-run Korean Central News Agency also claimed, 'The righteous reaction will get stronger to smash the evil doings.'

Describing the attacks a 'serious national security matter,' the White House said on Thursday that the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Justice were taking the investigation into matter 'as seriously as you would expect.' The terrorist threat has been the topic of 'daily' meetings at the White House, press secretary Earnest said, led by the president's homeland security adviser and cyber coordinator and include senior members of intelligence community, Homeland Security Department, the military and of the law enforcement and diplomatic communities. As the discussions continue, the president's national security team is 'considering a range of options,' Earnest said. 'Destructive activity merits an appropriate response,' he said and one that is 'not always obvious, but is something that is worthy of careful consideration. 'And that's exactly what the president's national security team is doing,' he explained. At the same time, the Obama administration is keenly aware that 'oftentimes' perpetrators of these types of attacks are 'seeking to provoke a response from United States of America,' he said. 'They may believe that a response from the United States in one fashion or another would be advantageous to them.' He later clarified that in the White House's view, 'It's not hard to imagine that there may be some organizations or individuals who would perceive a specific response from the United States as something that might enhance their standing either among their cohorts of colleagues or even on the international stage.' The Obama administration official said he could not provide any details 'at this point' on the actions the federal government may engage in and cautioned that they will likely include 'the kinds of things that we wouldn't want to telegraph in advance.' And Earnest said he may not ever be able to share that information. 'I also wouldn't commit...to at some point being entirely transparent...about what that response is,' he warned reporters. On Wednesday the president also promised that his administration believe the cyberattack to be 'very serious.' 'We're investigating it. We're taking it seriously. You know, we'll be vigilant. If we see something that we think is serious and credible, then we'll alert the public,' he said in an interview with ABC News. 'But for now, my recommendation would be that people go to the movies,' he added.","Senior U.S. officials have already indicated that the country was 'centrally involved'

"Never one to shy away from telling people what he thinks of current technology trends, Steve Wozniak has now turned his attention to Google Glass. In a recent interview, the Apple co-founder said he admired Google Glass owners who are brave enough to try something new, but believes the technology 'makes no sense in terms of what it does.' He also labelled previous smartwatches disappointing, and said they should never replace a person's phone. Scroll down for video . In a recent interview, the Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak said he admired Google Glass owners who are brave enough to try something new, but said the technology 'makes no sense in terms of what it does.' He also labelled previous smartwatches disappointing, and said they shouldn't ever replace a person's phone . But, the 64-year-old did praise Apple boss Tim Cook for breaking the 'dogma' that had come from Steve Jobs by releasing larger phones, in the form of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. Speaking to the Australian Financial Review, after becoming an Australian citizen earlier this month, Mr Wozniak said: 'I feel like the coolest person in the world when I am wearing [Google Glass]. Experts predict 2015 will be the year when people forsake gadgets, social networks and other technology in favour of the simple life. Recent figures have already revealed that certain social networks are losing favour, and now a digital trends report believes we are entering the era of the ‘neo-Luddite’. The prediction was made by London-based communications agency Hotwire in its sixth annual Digital Trends Report. ‘While there are many early adopters out there scrambling around to get their hands on the latest smartwatch or iPhone, there are a group of much cooler kids working out ways to kill tech altogether,’ explained the report. ‘Welcome to the era of the neo-Luddite. They’re here to make sure you switch off.’ 'When I see people wearing it, I also think they are cool because they are brave enough to play with the future with a device. '[But], in my mind, it is a great product that will not succeed.' He added Google will need to find one great commercial application for it to appeal to the masses, but added he hopes the firm doesn't give up on the technology. Mr Wozniak co-founded Apple with Steve Jobs during the 1970s, and was responsible for designing the Apple I computer. He left the company in 1987. In terms of smartwatches, Wozniak told AFR that no company has yet been able to create a 'compelling' device, and he had been disappointed with early models of the technology. 'Like Apple did with smartphones, one company may point the right way to a smart and useful watch, but it shouldn’t be a replacement for what the phone does,' continued Mr Wozniak. 'And it should have an unbelievable and fun feeling when you use it.' Looking forward, Mr Wozniak said connected cars are likely to be a popular trend next year.

'One company may point the right way to a smart and useful watch, but it shouldn’t be a replacement for what the phone does,' continued Mr Wozniak . Apple’s 4.7-inch iPhone 6 and the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus were the first devices to break away from the firm's typical 4-inch displays on previous handsets. They were unveiled at the Flint Center for the Performing Arts at De Anza College in Cupertino in September. Mr Wozniak recently told a conference in Texas that if Apple had released a larger screen, sooner, it would have been able to steal a larger portion of the smartphone market from its rivals over the past three years.

"Ever lost your holiday luggage on a flight? Well, don't give up hope just yet. Maria Dellos of Tucson, Arizona, has been reunited with baggage that went missing 20 years ago. She received a call from Tucson International Airport on Tuesday about her old bag, containing art supplies from a Las Vegas trade show worth an estimated $600. The carrier had apparently been buried away in storage and forgotten about until a recent spring clean. It is unclear which airline was responsible for losing it. Scroll down for video . Overjoyed: Maria Dellos of Tucson, Arizona, has been reunited with baggage that went missing 20 years ago . Almost forgotten about: She received a call from someone at Tucson International Airport on Tuesday about her old bag, which contained art supplies (pictured) from a Las Vegas trade show worth an estimated $600 . It is also unknown how TSA agents tracked Dellos down with no luggage label to go on. However, typing her name into Google along with the word 'art' pulls up her website to the top spot with her contact details listed. On opening the goods Dellos, a full-time artist, said she was absolutely 'thrilled' and the paints are still very 'creamy and usable.' She told News 4 Tucson that she almost ignored the call from the TSA lost and found department because she thought is was telemarketer. At the airport she opened the contents of her bag with a camera crew watching. She discovered handwritten notes inside her case, with her old address of 20 years ago scrawled on one piece of paper. 'When I looked at this note, it was dated, it dated me as 20 years ago! And I was just absolutely blown away,' she said. Reunited at last: Dellos told News 4 Tucson that she almost ignored the call from the TSA lost and found department because she thought is was telemarketer . Flashback: She discovered handwritten notes inside her case, with her old address of 20 years ago scrawled on one piece of paper . TSA Spokesperson Nico Melendez said that the items are 'interesting' because they pre-date the agency. The government body was established in 2001 and is now responsible for screening passengers and baggage at more than 450 U.S. airports. Melendez says that Dellos' bag probably surfaced during a recent reshuffle of equipment at the airport. Dellos had used dozens of plastic baggies to stop her art supplies from leaking and Melendez praised her for being ahead of the game, as this is now a modern day requirement for liquids. Dellos hasn't been very lucky in the luggage department. She also had a bag go missing in August but thankfully that was returned recently too. Last year there was an estimated 22 million pieces of lost, damaged or delayed baggage around the world. The top cause for such problems were handlers making transfer errors between planes.","Maria Dellos from Arizona has been reunited with baggage that went missing 20 years ago .

"Father Christmas will be sitting pretty this Christmas after swapping his tired wooden sledge for this high-tech 'super sleigh'. The £200,000 ($313,000) carriage comes complete with built-in GPS navigation, parking sensors and a chimney camera. It also features a bulletproof Lexan polycarbonate front window, a convertible roof and a built-in nose wiper for Santa's magical reindeer. Pimp my sleigh: The £200,000 ($313,000) carriage comes complete with built-in GPS navigation, parking sensors and a chimney camera . And more presents could get delivered this year as Rudolph and his friends will have access to hybrid-powered rocket boosters when they are running low on energy. Other features include an e-reader mount for easy access to the naughty-and-nice list, a mistletoe air freshener and a cup warmer with hot chocolate. The concept Gadget Sleigh 900 (GS-900) has been designed by Metals4U in Pontefract, West Yorkshire in time for Christmas Eve. 'We just felt like Santa deserved a bit of an upgrade,' said customer service operative, Michael Ward said: 'His old wooden sleigh is a little bit dated and we wanted to bring him into the 21st century.' Move over Mercedes: The sleigh also features a bulletproof Lexan polycarbonate front window, a convertible roof and a built-in nose wiper . Crackers: More presents could get delivered this year as Rudolph and his friends will have access to hybrid-powered rocket boosters . Supersonic: The concept Gadget Sleigh 900 (GS-900) has been designed by Metals4U in Pontefract, West Yorkshire in time for Christmas Eve . 'The rocket boosters can give the reindeer a hand too if they get tired.' The sleigh is streamlined, for maximum efficiency and, for the first time ever, Santa can now listen to festive tunes on his travels, with the integrated sound system. According to science, the speed at which the reindeers fly will cause them to burst into flames almost immediately after taking flight . He's making a list, and checking it twice, to find out who has been naughty and nice. But Santa might also want to jot down a few equations and sums, as he'll need to grapple with the laws of physics come Christmas Eve. Of course, it's unlikely Santa has to deal with the rules of science in quite the same way as regular people, but he might want to take a glance or two at the task awaiting him on his trip this year. For starters, assuming that Santa doesn't handle certain faiths, he'll have about 378 million children to deliver to in a fairly short time frame, according to one scientist. That means he has 822.6 visits per second to cope with, requiring a stay of about one thousandth of a second to deliver presents to each home. All in all, Santa's sleigh will need to move about 650 miles (1,050km) per second, which is 3,000 times the speed of sound or 0.35 per cent the speed of light. iF each child were to receive a present no more than 2lbs (0.9kg) in weight, the sleigh would still weigh more than 320,000 tons - just shy of the weight of the Empire State Building, 370,000 tons. An average reindeer on Earth can pull only 300 pounds (135kg), so in this scenario 214,200 reindeer would be needed. But with the weight and speed of the sleigh, it appears that the front two reindeer - Dasher and Dancer, until Rudolph's inclusion - will be subjected to 13.4 quintillion joules of energy per second. This will cause them to burst into flames almost immediately after taking flight. The entire reindeer team, assuming only eight are used, would be vapourised in 4.26 thousandths of a second. If anyone but Santa wants to fly through the sky, they'll need to stump up a hefty of £200,000 ($313,000). Mr Ward said: 'We've had a lot of interest but no-one has actually ordered one yet. If anyone does order one, we will build one complete with all the features.' The Gadget Sleigh's product page comes with fake reviews from Rudolf, Mrs Claus and an elf. 'I love the sleigh. It makes my job easier and the nose-wiper is perfect. I've noticed my nose shining brighter than ever,' wrote Rudolf. Mrs Claus said: 'The GS-900 is far better than the wooden sleigh and also much safer. He'll get back from his trip much earlier this year which is great as I always give him a little treat on his return.'

"Celebrities have been watching millions of their Instagram followers vanish after the social media site announced that it was going to crack down hard on spammers and fake accounts. Justin Bieber, Kendall and Kylie Jenner, Ariana Grande and Harry Styles were among those hardest hit by the process - dubbed 'Instagram Rapture' - that kicked off this week. The photo-sharing site said it was removing deactivated spam accounts and accounts that violate their community guidelines. The Instagram crackdown has caused a major shake-up in the Instagram stakes, with Kim Kardashian (right) taking the crown from Justin Bieber (left) as the most followed person on the site, with 22.2 million followers . Bieber lost a massive 3.5 million fans in 24 hours (15 per cent of his total), while Kim Kardashian watched 1.3 million disappear and Harry Styles saw his followers tumble by more than 800,000. This has caused a major shake-up in the Instagram stakes, with Kim Kardashian taking the crown from Bieber as the most followed person on the site, with 22.2 million followers. Bieber is now in third place behind Beyonce Knowles, who lost around 866,000 followers after the purge, but is still sitting pretty with a total of 21.4 million followers. According to an infographic produced by web developer Zach Allia, other casualties in the spam crackdown included Taylor Swift, Miley Cyrus, Niall Horan and Bruno Mars, who all lost more than 700,000 followers each. Rapper Ma$e is reported to have gone so far as to delete his Instagram account, after losing 1.5 million followers out of 1.6 million, taking his new follower total to just 272,000. 'We want to maintain the best possible experience on Instagram, so we do our best to remove spam, fake accounts and other people and posts that don't follow our Community Guidelines,' the company wrote in a blog post last Wednesday. Harry Styles (left) and Ariana Grande (right)  were among those hardest his by the process - dubbed 'Instagram Rapture' - that kicked off this week . Instagram uses took to Twitter to express their shock - and even outrage - over the clampdown this week . 'As we remove these accounts, some people may notice a decrease in their follower/following counts.' 'When we remove accounts from Instagram that don't follow our Community Guidelines, you may see a decrease in your follower count. 'This shouldn't affect engagement from authentic accounts that like and comment on your posts.' Celebrities have long been suspected of buying followers to improve their standing on social media sites - and for some commentators this 'Instagram rapture' appeared to confirm these suspicions. 'This Instagram bloodbath is hilarious,' Josh 'The Fat Jew' Ostrovsky, a popular Instagrammer with 2.2 million followers, told Business Insider. For some commentators,  this 'Instagram rapture' appeared to confirm suspicions that celebrities had been buying followers to improve their status on Instagram . Sisters Kendall (left) and Kylie Jenner (right) also saw their Instagram followers tumble in the purge . 'This should be a national Holiday. We all know who bought followers, so today just corroborated everyone's suspicions. So many people losing their followers, watching their digital worlds crumble. Today is so fun.' But it wasn't only celebrities who lost followers, as users across the site saw their follower numbers drop, causing many to lash out at Instagram's new policy. 'Why the hell would u do this?!?!? I lost like 30 followers! We earned them!!! We don't care if they're spams or fake!! We just like the fact that they follow us!!! Please give them back!!!!!' one user wrote. But other users welcomed the Instagram crackdown and have called for other social media sites to follow suit and clean-up their acts. Talk show host Andy Cohen tweeted: 'I lost 20k followers in the #InstagramPurge and I'm feeling cleaner than ever! Only real people, please! Twitter, next?'

"Amy Pascal is taking steps to deal with an exchange of racist emails that were leaked during the Sony hack last week. The shamed studio head meet with Al Sharpton in New York on Thursday where the pair talked about the incident for almost two hours. Afterwards, Sharpton shared his thoughts on how things went on Twitter. Scroll down for video . Working for progress: Al Sharpton (above) met with Amy Pascal in New York Thursday to discuss the lack of diversity in Hollywood . Shamed: This over a week after leaked emails showed a racist exchange about President Obama between Sony head Pascal (above) and producer Scott Rudin . 'Very pointed and blunt exchange w/Amy Pascal in our 90 min meeting,' he tweeted. 'Hollywood needs to change. Her leaked e mails show a cultural blindness.' He later held a news conference and appeared on Politics Nation where he revealed that Sony was creating a 'working group' to discuss and address the lack of racial diversity in Hollywood. This after Pascal's racist emails went public. On the eve of a fundraising breakfast in November 2013 being attended by the President at the home of DreamWorks CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg, Pascal and Rudin went over things she could discuss with Obama while at the event. 'Should I ask him if he liked DJANGO?' Pascal asks Rudin, a reference to the 2012 Quentin Tarantino film Django Unchained that dealt with the subject of slavery in the antebellum South. '12 years,' responds Rudin, referencing another slavery film, this time Steve McQueen's 2013 Academy Award-winning work 12 Years a Slave, a very violent and brutal look at the injustice and abuse endured by the millions forced into slavery in America. The pair then keep going, listing as many current films starring black actors as they can name, including Lee Daniels' The Butler and two Kevin Hart movies, Think Like a Man and Ride Along. 'I bet he likes Kevin Hart,' says Rudin at one point. Staying quiet: Rudin (above) has been laying low since the emails were leaked . Pascal issued an apology saying: 'The content of my emails were insensitive and inappropriate but are not an accurate reflection of who I am.' She then added, 'although this was a private communication that was stolen, I accept full responsibility for what I wrote and apologize to everyone who was offended.' Sharpton released his own statement at the time, saying; 'These emails nominate Amy Pascal to be considered by some of us in the same light that we concluded and moved on the ownership of Donald Sterling of the L.A. Clippers.'","Amy Pascal met with Al Sharpton in New York on Thursday where the two discussed the lack of diversity in Hollywood .

"Amir Khan has no interest in a domestic dust-up with Kell Brook as he looks to land a fight with pound-for-pound superstars Floyd Mayweather or Manny Pacquiao next year. Brook, who earlier this year captured the IBF welterweight title before being forced to take time away from the ring when he was stabbed while in Tenerife, has long courted a showdown with the Bolton fighter. But Khan believes he is a level above Brook and would prefer to be matched against the two biggest fighters in the sport. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Amir Khan: Scared Floyd Mayweather thinks I'd beat him . Amir Khan lands a left hand during his impressive win on decision against Devon Alexander . Kell Brook has long courted a fight with Khan but the Bolton boxer says he is 'not interested' 'I'm not really interested in the Kell Brook fight,' Khan said. 'I'm looking at the biggest names in boxing. Floyd Mayweather, Manny Pacquiao, I think that's where I belong. 'If the fight doesn't happen with Floyd then maybe Manny Pacquiao is another option. I'd like to fight in May to keep myself busy and sharp. I think that helps me.' Khan produced arguably the finest performance of his career on Saturday night in a lopsided points win over former two-weight world champion Devon Alexander. Floyd Mayweather is one of the two superstars who Khan wants a fight with . Brook was attacked with a machete and here he is pictured in his home in Sheffield during his recovery . It was just Khan's second fight in the 147lb division, although many believe his style would cause all sorts of problems for the unbeaten Mayweather. However, the WBC and WBA champion is targeting a super fight with WBO titlist Manny Pacquiao and dismissed Khan earlier this week, saying of the 28-year-old: 'No one knows who Amir Khan is.' Khan, though, has not given up hope, saying: 'I want the fight, but is Floyd going to take the fight? Is Floyd going to give me that chance? That's something we're all waiting to hear from Floyd Mayweather. Manny Pacquiao is the other boxer who Khan wants a superfight with . 'I've been asking for the fight for the last two or three years. Now he needs to come back to the press and say, 'I want the fight with Amir Khan'. 'I know I'm touching distance away from that super fight. I think I've proven myself many times and I think this time I've proved myself in the biggest way so he has to take the fight. What else do I have to do? 'I know if I can bring Floyd Mayweather to Britain then I'll sell out Wembley Stadium. How big does he need my name to be? Khan arrived back in Manchester along with his wife and daughter on Wednesday . 'I think these are little excuses. I'm sure people realise that. It seems to me he doesn't want to fight me. I have the speed, dexterity, accuracy, movement, power; I think it's something that he doesn't really want to mix with.' Khan, meanwhile, is to donate the shorts he wore in beating Alexander to raise money for the school in Pakistan where 132 schoolchildren were shot dead by the Taliban on Tuesday. The shorts have 24 carat gold thread woven through the waistband and cost around £30,000. Khan, who is of Pakistani heritage, said: 'I'm going to be donating them towards what happened in Pakistan.

"A mother-of-three who was denied entry to a bar because she was too fat and once got stuck in a football stadium turnstile was finally convinced to lose weight after breaking a church pew by sitting on it. Tipping the scales at  26st 13lbs, Karen Dawson, 40, from Rhondda, south Wales, was morbidly obese and a dress size 38 when she attended her mother-in-law's funeral in 2011. The customer services adviser was left mortified when the wooden church pew split underneath her bulk as she sat down for the service. Scroll down for video . Karen Dawson, 40, from Rhondda, Wales, was left mortified when the wooden pew she was sitting on at her mother-in-law's funeral snapped. Karen dieted and dropped from 26st 13lbs (left) to 18st 1lb (right) She vowed to change her eating patterns and, by swapping greasy takeaways for salads and lean meat, lost 8st 12lbs in just two years. Karen said: 'It was one of the most embarrassing moments of my life. As soon as the bench cracked underneath me, I knew my weight was a problem. 'After dieting, I now feel so much more confident about myself and I'm no longer terrified of breaking any chairs I sit on. 'My funeral shame was excruciating but it was the kick start I needed to lose weight.' Karen, pictured with one of her three children began struggling with weight gain after she turned 18 . Karen began struggling with weight gain after moving out of her parents' house shortly after she turned 18. Away from the watchful eye of her health-conscious mother, she was able to munch on sweets, crisps and other fatty snacks. As an adult, she liked nothing better than spending a sedentary evening in with her husband Warren, 48, a British Airways worker. After giving birth to three children MacKenzie, seven, Jaxon, three and Dexter, two, Karen weighed nearly 27 stone. The mother-of-three decided to join her local Slimming World group Llantwit Fardre in Church Village and, for the first time in her adult life, started paying close attention to what she ate . However, she continued to eat whatever she wanted, despite regularly being put in embarrassing situations because of her size. She said: 'I tried to get into a local bar when I was overweight, and man on the door told me I couldn't come in because of my size. 'He simply said I was too fat. 'I was so shocked I just walked away. I didn't know what to say. 'I went to a football match with my husband once, and I was too big to go through the turnstile. 'Warren had to literally push me through the gap.' Karen with her three children MacKenzie, seven, Jaxon, three and Dexter, two . Karen also broke numerous office chairs due to her large frame. She said: 'Whenever I was out for dinner I had to ask for the restaurant not to seat me in a booth as I would squeeze into the space. 'If my husband and I went for a coffee, I always had to look through the window to check that they didn't have fixed seats. 'Clothes were a problem too, one time I applied for a job at a supermarket and they told me not to bother having an interview as they would never find a uniform which fitted me.' Karen, pictured on her wedding day with husband Warren, 48, a British Airways worker . The final straw came in 2011, though, while attending the funeral of her mother-in-law Lynne. Karen sat on a church pew only to have it split beneath her. She said: 'I sat down and my bulk split the entire wooden pew. I was mortified. 'I didn't break enough so that everyone fell off, but I was terrified that it would completely give way during the funeral. 'As we watched the coffin being lowered, I wanted the ground to swallow me up. 'As soon as the funeral ended I got out of there as quick as I could - I was really ashamed.' Karen has managed to shed more than eight stone and has dropped eight dress sizes to now weigh 18st 1lb . The mother-of-three decided to join her local Slimming World group Llantwit Fardre in Church Village and, for the first time, started paying close attention to what she ate. Before her dramatic weight loss, Karen would eat nothing for breakfast, have an egg mayonnaise sandwich with crisps and sweets for lunch and an Indian takeaway for dinner consisting of a chicken korma, rice, chips and onion bhajis. Throughout the day she would snack on sweets, chocolate, biscuits and crisps. Karen has swapped fatty takeaways for lean meat . Today, she eats Slimming World scan bran for breakfast, homemade vegetable soup for lunch and a chilli con carne made with extra-lean mince served with potatoes cooked in low-fat frying oven. She has since managed to shed more than eight stone and has dropped down eight dress sizes. She now weighs 18st 1lb. She said: 'I still want to lose a lot more, but this last year has made a huge difference to my life. She said: 'I used to eat what I wanted, whenever I wanted it, and I ate until I was really big. I thought nothing of what I was doing to my body - I was perfectly happy. 'Wherever I went I could see people staring at me and nudging each other. 'I would shrug it off though, I was always the fat jolly one and I used to make fun of myself - but I wasn't happy.' 'Now I can get down on the floor and play with my kids, I also feel confident enough to take them out at weekends.

"'There's a big gate today,’ a bald man in the public gallery whispered in broad Scouse. It was the 118th day of the Hills- borough Inquests and it was Kenny Dalglish’s turn to give evidence. Even the Rt Hon Sir John Goldring, bespectacled coroner in grey three-piece suit, blue tie and blue pocket square, seemed caught up in the hoopla as his counsel, Christina Lambert QC, tried to establish Dalglish’s bone fides. Kenny Dalglish arrives at Warrington Coroner's Court to give evidence at the Hillsborough inquests . But it was tragedy and not his professional abilities that brought Liverpool’s most venerated player to this court in a Warrington business park. The events of April 15, 1989, when 96 supporters were crushed to death at the Leppings Lane end of Hillsborough during Liverpool’s FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest, defined Dalglish as a legend of his bereft club as much as did his trophy-laden deeds as a player of extravagant ability. Still, 25 years later, there is no closure for either the grieving relatives or Dalglish. The furrows on his brow have no doubt been deepened by the trauma of that sunny spring day in Yorkshire and its aftermath, which saw him attend up to four funerals a day, before he stepped down as manager, exhausted by duty, 21 months later. Dalglish’s ordeal in this fractious court lasted one hour and 45 minutes. Dalglish gave his evidence in the final afternoon session before the hearings adjourn for the Christmas break . Having quizzed Dalglish about what he had described in his autobiography as fans ‘bunking in’ to watch the 1986 FA Cup final against Everton at Wembley, John Beggs QC, representing some of the police officers involved, then drew the court’s attention to Home Office reports of ticketless and drunken Liverpool fans at the 1989 FA Cup final, the month after Hillsborough. Did people bunk in? ‘I have no evidence of people bunking in at Wembley (in 1989),’ said Dalglish, who added that there was ‘a clamour’ across Merseyside to ‘show unity for those who had lost loved ones at Hillsborough’. Dalglish walks off the pitch followed by Forest boss Brian Clough on that tragic day back in April 1989 . Beggs asked if Dalglish thought fans arriving late or drinking too much at Hillsborough may have ‘contributed to the disorder that followed’. Lord Justice Goldring was unimpressed, telling Beggs that he knew ‘perfectly well’ the witness could not answer that question. Three times the jury and Dalglish left the court as the lawyers argued. But despite the odd moment of clear anguish when he relived the day of ‘mayhem’ — how he was thankful his own 12-year-old son, Paul, was OK — Dalglish was calm and dignified. Beggs claimed there was a ‘cohort of Liverpool fans before, during and after Hillsborough… who were prone to fight’. Dalglish countered: ‘Liverpool fans with that exception (the riot at Heysel Stadium in 1985) were very highly respected and revered.’ Dalglish was the 160th witness to give evidence in person. The Hills- borough Inquests, started after the Attorney General quashed the original verdicts, has heard character portraits of the dead, of how the emergency services acted and how the stadium was prepared. The inquests are expected to run until next summer, when a jury of seven men and four women will pronounce on the memory of the 96 fans who perished at a football match. Liverpool supporters hold up scarves during a memorial service at Anfield back in April this year to mark the 25th anniversary of Hillsborough.

"Admission: Actor Stephen Collins has admitted to inappropriate conduct with young girls in a new confessional essay for People magazine . A woman molested by Stephen Collins when she was just ten has refused to accept his belated apology and insisted he did gain sexual gratification by ejaculating while making her touch him inappropriately. The shamed actor, who played the righteous dad and pastor on long-running TV show 7th Heaven, recently came out to confirm shocking reports of sexual misconduct with young girls. The 67-year-old, who was never charged, confessed to inappropriately touching one girl and exposing himself to two others between 1973 and 1994. The former TV star insisted 'there was no gratification' - calling it an 'impulsive act.. that's haunted him ever since'. But a woman in her 50s, who cannot be named, claims to be one of Collins' victims and says he is lying, TMZ reports. She said: 'Stephen is minimizing the incident. It was not just a spontaneous touching ... that aggression resulted in him ejaculating.' She also slammed his decision not to apologize to her and another girl he targeted, adding: 'His assertion that he wanted to avoid reopening an old wound seems nonsensical to me.' The woman refuses to believe there were just three victims - as Collins stated in a taped confession leaked to TMZ by his soon-to-be ex-wife Faye Grant during their bitter divorce proceedings. She has filed a police report with the NYPD and an investigation is underway - although it's believed any case would be rejected because of the statute of limitations. Scroll down for video . Scandal: Collins is best known for playing Reverend Eric Camden on long-running family drama 7th Heaven (left). Reports about his indiscretions first came to light in October when his estranged wife Faye Grant (pictured together on the right) released a taped confession which was obtained TMZ . The woman adds: 'Why isn't he donating any disposable income, beyond what he needs to survive, to a child-abuse charity. Maybe he should at least try apologizing to his victims.' Collins admitted to three incidents in a lengthy confessional essay for People magazine, saying he inappropriately touched one girl and exposed himself to two others between 1973 and 1994, and that his actions were 'inexcusable' and have 'haunted' him ever since. While none of his victims have ever publicly come forward, and the 67-year-old never charged, reports of his misbehavior surfaced in October when his soon-to-be ex-wife Faye Grant released a taped confession which was obtained by TMZ in the midst of their bitter divorce. In the public backlash to the TMZ tapes, Collins lost parts on TV show Scandal and in the sequel to the movie Ted, while re-runs of 7th Heaven were pulled from the air. 'Forty years ago, I did something terribly wrong that I deeply regret. I have been working to atone for it ever since,' Collins wrote in People. Family values: 7th Heaven was a show about a pastor and his wife, raising their large brood of seven children. A young Jessica Biel (to Collins' right in a blue sweater) played the couple's oldest daughter. Collins says he never behaved inappropriately toward any of the young actresses on the show's set . He says he's decided to speak publicly about the reports because he believes some of his actions have been elaborated. 'On the recording, I described events that took place 20, 32, and 40 years ago,' Collins adds. 'The publication of the recording has resulted in assumptions and innuendos about what I did that go far beyond what actually occurred. As difficult as this is, I want people to know the truth.' He says the only time he touched a girl inappropriately was in 1973, when he was 25 and a pre-teen girl came to stay with him and his first wife. Collins says he exposed himself to the girl twice before, but took things to another level on the visit. 'When the girl and I were watching TV alone, I moved her hand in such a way that caused her to touch me inappropriately. It lasted less than a minute, during which there was no gratification,' Collins said. 'I then left the room. I had no further physical contact with her. It was a completely impulsive act and it's haunted me ever since to think of what I put her through.' Over the next two decades, Collins says he continued to expose himself to two more teenage girls, once in 1982 and again in 1994. Interview: Collins of 7th Heaven fame will appear on 20/20 in an interview with Katie Couric in which he confesses to his sex crimes but says he's a changed man who hasn't touched an underage girl since 1994 . 'The first instance lasted second and the second about a minute,' Collins says of the indecent exposure. 'I had no physical contact of any kind with either girl. I don't say this to excuse what I did - it was inexcusable - but to clarify what actually happened.' Collins says the exposure in 1994 was his 'rock bottom' and what caused him to finally seek help for his deviant behavior. For the past 20 years, Collins says he's been undergoing therapy and religious counseling, while praying and meditating every day. These treatments, Collins claims, have worked and kept him from harming other young girls. 'Since that day in 1994, I have not had an impulse to act out in any such way.' Collins has only apologized directly to one of his victims, who he says was 'extraordinary gracious', but has not reached out to the others for fear that he will be 'opening old wounds'. The actor also describes how the recorded confession came to be. He says he and his wife Grant were undergoing marriage therapy sessions in hopes of healing their relationship. The second follow-up session is when Collins says he and the therapist were taped by his wife without either of their knowledge. The shamed actor appears alongside Jessica Biel in 7th Heaven: The Long Bad Summer . The couple of nearly 30 years filed for divorce in 2012 but have been engaged in a heated legal battle over how to split their assets. Grant, who is also an actress, is fighting for high spousal support payments of $13,000 a month, saying she is no longer able to make a living from her career when she took a break to raise their daughter. She also says she only released the taped confession to police, when Collins allegedly denied to seek treatment for his issues. She denies ever turning the audio over to TMZ. Collins says the release of the tapes in October led to confusion over when he exposed himself to the young girls, and if it was possible one of his young co-stars on 7th Heaven was a victim. Bitter divorce: Faye Grant, pictured with Stephen Collins in both images, leaked a tape of the actor confessing to molesting girls to TMZ . 'I appeared for eleven seasons on a television series with a cast that included minor females in our TV family, and countless other young actresses throughout the show's eleven years. I never behaved inappropriately on or off that set - or on any set I've ever worked on.' When the tapes were first released, law enforcement in New York and Los Angeles said they were investigating the claims. But law enforcement sources who spoke with TMZ said that despite the taped confession, they felt Collins would not be charged and 'the cases will go nowhere'. The LAPD confirmed to MailOnline on Wednesday that they never reopened a case into Collins, and had simply been reviewing the recording in October. Calls and emails to the NYPD were not immediately returned Wednesday. Collins says he planned to release a statement after his divorce was finalized, but decided to come forward earlier when the trial was postponed. He says he owed family, friends and the public an explanation. 'I want to reassure them about who I am, and I want them to understand that I take these issues very seriously,' he said. Collins is due to speak about the essay with Katie Couric on Friday.","Woman claims she was molested aged ten and will not accept confession .

"New laws with echoes of Labour's anti-social behaviour orders will be used to bring radical preachers under control, the Home Secretary has revealed. Theresa May said Britain must use 'all the legal powers we need to prevail' after American journalist James Foley was beheaded by a masked 'British' extremist dubbed Jihadi John. They would include new civil powers to target radical preachers whose outbursts fall short of breaking the law, and similar Asbo-style 'banning orders' to outlaw groups communicating extreme views. Scroll down for video . New powers: Theresa May said Britain must introduce all the legal powers necessary to win the struggle against terror. These are set to include civil orders for those whose activities fall short of breaking the law . Neither would be criminal proceedings but breaching them could be a crime. This aspect is similar to Asbos, which have largely fallen out of use since they launched in 1998 amid widespread controversy. The laws also follow on from control orders, which were declared a breach of human rights in 2011 and turned into less stringent Terrorism Investigation and Prevention Measures (Tpims). But these orders are targeted at those directly suspected of terrorism, whereas Mrs May indicated the new laws would focus on those spreading or preaching extremist views. Writing in the Telegraph, Mrs May added the government was already using powers to to strip citizenship from British jihadists fighting in Iraq and Syria - of which there are more than 500. Since the coalition came to power in 2010 more than 150 people have already been excluded from Britain for 'unacceptable behaviour', including foreign hate preachers. Horror: A still from the brutal video released by Islamic State militants who beheaded journalist James Foley . The new laws would target those who slip through the cracks between what is unacceptable and what is illegal, but this is nothing new. The government introduced control orders in 2005 for terror suspects who did not meet the threshold to be prosecuted, putting heavy restrictions on their freedom of movement. Home Office sources argued the suspects could only not be prosecuted because the evidence against them was inadmissable in court - for example, wiretaps by security agents or sources who could not go on the record. Nonetheless the orders were declared a breach of human rights - including the right to a fair trial - and replaced in 2011 by Terrorism Investigation and Prevention Measures (Tpims). The new Tpims meant the state had to have a 'reasonable belief' of terrorist activity, more than the 'suspicion' of the previous law. The Home Office has not set out any more detail about the new laws, including how they would differ from their predecessors. But Mrs May indicated they will focus more on preachers - in other words, anyone who wishes to spread extremism to others - rather than those directly planning a terror attack. Mrs May said the powers applied to Britons with dual citizenship and those who have been naturalised, but not those who have life-long sole British nationality as it is illegal to make citizens 'stateless'. However, she insisted those jihadists would be prosecuted when they return home . 'We will be engaged in this struggle for many years, probably decades', the Home Secretary wrote. 'We must give ourselves all the legal powers we need to prevail. 'I am looking again at the case for new banning orders for extremist groups that fall short of the legal threshold for terrorist proscription, as well as for new civil powers to target extremists who seek to radicalise others.' She added: 'People who insist on travelling to fight in Syria and Iraq will be investigated by the police and security services. 'For those who have dual nationality, I have the power to strip them of their citizenship and exclude them from the country. 'Following the recent Immigration Act, I can, in certain circumstances, remove citizenship from naturalised Britons who are fighting overseas and exclude them too. 'And while it is illegal for any country to make its citizens stateless, any British national who returns from Syria and Iraq faces prosecution here for participating in terrorist activities abroad.' Since 2010 police have secured the removal of  28,000 pieces of terrorist material from the internet, she added. Mrs May wrote: 'The cowardly murder this week of James Foley, a man who was working to highlight the suffering of the Syrian people to the world, has demonstrated once again the very deadly threat we face from terrorism at home and abroad.' A Home Office spokesman told MailOnline she was unable to provide any detail on the proposed new powers. Killed: Mr Foley (pictured) was abducted while reporting on Syria in 2012 and is believed to have died recently . Yvette Cooper, Labour's shadow home secretary, said: 'More action is needed to respond to the serious problem of people travelling to fight with Isil (Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant). 'The Home Secretary's confirmation that she is continuing to look at the recommendations of the Prime Minister's Taskforce, announced last December, is welcome. 'Though there remains no detail on things like civil powers to tackle extremists or extremist groups for people to consider. 'However I remain concerned that the Government is not addressing the gaps in the Prevent programme - especially the lack of support for community led approaches to preventing radicalisation. 'And the Home Secretary also needs to respond to the concerns raised by the current and previous Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation about the decision to weaken control orders, where they have advised that stronger measures should be put in place.' Terror: Islamic State militants have swept through Iraq and Syria, flying their flag near Aleppo (pictured) The government has come under pressure from Lord Dannatt, the former head of the Army, to build bridges with Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad to tackle the militants operating in Syria and Iraq. But Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said an alliance with Assad would not be 'practical, sensible or helpful', and the government has called for Assad to be removed over his actions during the country's bloody civil war. Asked if Britain would have to collaborate with the Assad regime, Mr Hammond told BBC Radio 4's The World at One: 'No. We may very well find that we are fighting, on some occasions, the same people that he is but that doesn't make us his ally.'","Theresa May proposes new civil laws to target radical preachers and groups .
They would focus on people who do not meet threshold of breaking the law .

They also follow on from control orders, replaced by Tpims in 2011 .

"Rangers confirmed Derek Llambias as their new chief executive on Friday in a move that further cements Mike Ashley’s position at Ibrox. The former Newcastle United managing director was initially appointed to the Rangers board as a non-executive director early last month, a week or so after Ashley made a £2million loan to the strife-torn club. It had been widely expected that he would step forward as Graham Wallace’s replacement. The SFA issued notices of complaint against Rangers and Ashley earlier this week, alleging breaches of an undertaking about his influence on the day-to-day running of the club. A hearing will take place on January 27. Derek (pictured) Llambias has been appointed chief executive of Rangers . However, that pending case has not prevented Ashley’s ally Llambias being selected for a key Ibrox post. And it has also been reported that Ashley could underwrite a share issue in the New Year to aid barren club finances. The Newcastle United owner is currently limited to a 10-per-cent stake by an agreement with the SFA but could push for that to be raised to 29.9 per cent. The appointment of Llambias, ahead of Monday’s potentially stormy annual general meeting, means chairman David Somers will return to his previous role of non-executive chairman. ‘I am delighted that Derek has agreed to step up to the chief executive role,’ said Somers. ‘This is a successful outcome to the process, announced on October 27, 2014, where we interviewed a number of high-calibre candidates. Existing Board member Derek Llambias has been appointed Chief Executive Officer of Rangers with immediate effect. Derek joined the Board on 2 November 2014 as a non-executive director. In line with the cost cutting exercise announced on 12 November 2014, Mr Llambias's remuneration will be significantly lower than previously offered for this position. Additionally, David Somers will now revert to his previous role as non-executive Chairman. Commenting on the appointment, David Somers said 'I am delighted that Derek has agreed to step up to the Chief Executive role. This is a successful outcome to the process, announced on 27 October 2014, which involved interviewing a number of high calibre candidates. 'Derek has impressed us with his grasp of the issues since joining the group and brings a wealth of experience, particularly from his time at Newcastle United, which we feel confident will be invaluable to Rangers.' ‘Derek has impressed us with his grasp of the issues since joining the group and brings great experience, particularly from his time at Newcastle United, which we feel confident will be invaluable to Rangers.’ The Stock Exchange release also added that ‘in line with the cost-cutting exercise announced on November 12, 2014, Mr Llambias’ salary will be significantly lower than previously offered for this position.’ No specific figures were offered but predecessor Wallace was on a £315,000 salary with the possibility of a 100-per-cent bonus. Newcastle United manager Alan Pardew yesterday backed Llambias in his Ibrox role. ‘He took this club when it was paying a lot of money that was going to waste, which ended up with a relegation, and then managed to get them promoted again,’ said Pardew. Interim boss David Somers will revert to his previous role as non-executive chairman . ‘He was a big part of that and he will bring that experience to Rangers.’ The St James’ Park boss added that Llambias helped to stabilise the Premier League outfit during his time there. ‘In the position Rangers are in at the moment, he’s probably well-armed to do that,’ said Pardew. ‘Derek is an experienced chief executive. I wish him good luck.’ Llambias has already overseen an analysis of various departments at Rangers which has seen a number of staff, some of them long-serving, made redundant. It is thought that process was one of the factors which took its toll on manager Ally McCoist, who handed in his resignation notice last week. Newcastle manager Alan Pardew praised Llambias for his work at the North East club . McCoist met with Llambias and Sandy Easdale, chairman of the football board, on Wednesday for talks about his position. It had been speculated that the Ibrox boss would be offered a pay-off deal for his 12-month notice period but instead it emerged that he would continue for today’s game against Livingston. ‘I spoke to him (Llambias) before training,’ said McCoist yesterday. ‘Obviously I congratulated him on his new role. We’ll hopefully get a chance to sit down in the not-too-distant future to discuss plans for the team.’ It remains to be seen whether McCoist’s situation will change once the AGM is over, as a clearer financial path forward could open the way for a deal to be struck. The 52-year-old’s presence at the club could also act as a diversionary tactic for a board set to face flak from the floor, but McCoist is unclear about whether he will actually attend the meeting. Llambias joined the club's board as a non-executive member on November 2, having previously been managing director at Newcastle under Mike Ashley . Asked if he had been requested to address shareholders, McCoist said: ‘I haven’t. I addressed them last year but I’m not even sure I’m going on Monday. ‘That’s something we’ve yet to discuss. I’m more than willing to be there but if I’m not there it won’t be for any sinister reasons. ‘If I’m asked to be there and I’m asked to speak then I will. ‘I’m not fussed either way, but if people want me there then absolutely I’ll be there doing my job. ‘I’ve not thought about the AGM, there’s been so much going on. It’s been a heck of a week and I’ve just been trying to concentrate on training, which has been great.’","Derek Llambias becomes new Rangers chief executive .

"Liverpool and Arsenal have experienced rather similar seasons in quite a few respects. Brendan Rodgers and Arsene Wenger have come under pressure in relatively equal measure but seem to have ridden the storm for now. Neither possess a defence you would happily lock your valuables behind, nor a goalkeeper to store too much faith in – or his understudy. Attacking flair has been present but ultimately each have underwhelmed so far. Both Brendan Rodgers (left) and Arsene Wenger have been under pressure to improve results this season . But usually there is a a sharp edge to matches between these two and Sunday at Anfield promises an intriguing contest. Each side needs a result to boost the positive shoots of recent victories. In goal Liverpool are likely to turn once again to Brad Jones, who has shown in two games why it took so long for Simon Mignolet to get shifted to the bench. Diving out of the way for Wayne Rooney’s goal at Old Trafford like an out-of-control FIFA player was bad enough, before his error for Dan Gosling’s consolation in the Capital One Cup. Wojciech Szczesny will be in net for Arsenal and on occasion can look the commanding keeper Wenger wants. But he remains unconvincing at an elite level that the likes of David De Gea, Thibaut Courtois and Joe Hart are on. Brendan Rodgers has turned to back up goalkeeper Brad Jones following Simon Mignolet's poor form . Arsenal fans remain unconvinced by current No 1 goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny . In front are two defences that have been roundly criticised repeatedly. Liverpool’s has got worse than last season under Rodgers and at times seems to have as much organisation as a Christmas party dance floor when the free bar has been drained. Dejan Lovren, Martin Skrtel, and Kolo Toure fall some way short of a side with Champions League aspirations, while Rodgers’ three-at-the-back formation is yet to impress. On the Arsenal front, Per Mertesacker was slaughtered for his bizarre display in the defeat at Stoke while Calum Chambers needs time to settle. He is playing many more minutes than in his breakthrough season at Southampton. Injuries have led to a muddled selection on occasion. But Arsenal overall have defenders, when fit, more comfortable in their roles, and this is borne out in the statistics. They have conceded 19 goals at a rate of 1.19 per game - the fifth best record in the Premier League. Per Mertesacker has struggled to find form after a busy summer with Germany . Dejan Lovren (right) has endured a tough start to his career as a Liverpool defender . Wenger looks on during his side's 3-2 Premier League defeat at the hands of Stoke City . Liverpool have let in 22 to place 11th in the division in that aspect – at a rate of 1.38 per game. The pressure put on their defence is shown by their far greater number of blocks, clearances, and interceptions made: 804 (ninth-highest) to Arsenal’s 660 (18th). Liverpool’s options in midfield are myriad but the new signings have yet to spark. Adam Lallana has probably done best so far. Steven Gerrard looks like a man frustrated that a talent like Luis Suarez is no longer on the end of his passes. Steven Gerrard has cut a frustrated figure for the majority of the season so far . Gerrard looks on as Manchester United players celebrate during Liverpool's 3-0 defeat at Old Trafford . Arsenal have possibly even more options in this area, with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain improving, Aaron Ramsey beginning to find his feet again, and Santi Cazorla reinvigorated. Unsurprisingly, each side ranks highly for short passes and some way down the list for long balls. Arsenal have made 8,417 short passes to come second, Liverpool 7,018 to place seventh. Long balls see Arsenal bottom (715) and Liverpool 16th (915). Overall completion levels are 85 per cent for Arsenal and 84 per cent for Liverpool. In attack is where these teams divide clearest. Alexis Sanchez has been an instant hit, Olivier Giroud looks in fine nick and Danny Welbeck provides another option. Aaron Ramsey, seen his scoring against Galatasaray, looked to be finding form before an injury setback . Alexis Sanchez has hit the ground running for Arsenal, scoring nine Premier League goals this season . Olivier Giroud scored twice during a 4-1 Premier League win against Newcastle last weekend . Daniel Sturridge has been out injured since the end of August and will spend Christmas in America . For Liverpool, Mario Balotelli is yet to score in the Premier League, Daniel Sturridge has struggled repeatedly with injury, and Rickie Lambert’s dream move has not quite turned out that way. Liverpool have only scored 19 goals and sit mid table in this regard (10th), while Arsenal have hit 28 to rank fourth in the division to date. Total shots sees Arsenal on 194 (second) with Liverpool on 157 (seventh) while shots on target is 47 per cent for Arsenal and 45 per cent for Liverpool. A small margin but it means Arsenal have the fourth best rate for shots testing the goalkeeper to Liverpool’s 11th. A victory for Wenger’s mean on Sunday would add credence to Liverpool detractors who believe those places could be replicated in the real Premier League table come May.

"Darren Bent has had stolen two top-of-the-range cars worth £160,000 after burglars raided his home while he slept. The Aston Villa striker, who is currently on loan at Brighton and Hove Albion, was targeted by the thieves last Saturday night at his Little Aston property, near Sutton Coldfield. The burglars swiped keys to a high-spec Range Rover and a luxury Audi RS6, both worth around £80,000, before stealing them from the driveway. Darren Bent pictured in 2011 beside the luxury Range Rover stolen from his home at the weekend . Bent's home was targeted early last Saturday morning after thieves broke in through a window . Former England international Bent, signed by Villa for £18million in 2011, was shipped out on loan to Brighton last month. He has scored one goal in three games and had started for the struggling Championship side in their 1-0 defeat at home by Millwall the night before the burglary. Staffordshire Police were called to the address at 3.15am and discovered locks on a uPVC window had been snapped. Following an 'orderly' search, thieves had found car keys and driven off with the vehicles. Despite his record-breaking move to the Midlands, Bent made only one start for Villa this season under manager Paul Lambert.Despite his record-breaking move to the Midlands, Bent made only one start for Villa this season under manager Paul Lambert. Sergeant Richard Morris of Staffordshire Police said the break-in highlighted the pitfalls of cylinder locks on windows. The former Englan striker has had a frustrating time at Aston Villa and has been sent on loan to Brighton . 'Offenders have snapped the lock cylinder in two by applying force to the cylinder,' he said. The method of 'lock snapping' is becoming more prevalent among thieves as it can be completed within a matter of seconds. The crime caps a frustrating year for Bent, who has also played for Ipswich, Tottenham and Sunderland. Bent said of his month-long stint at the Seagulls: 'I wasn't getting a lot of game time at Aston Villa and it doesn't bother me that I've had to drop down a division to play football. 'I've seen Brighton play and they play like a Premier League team. They play good football. That's why I wanted to come here and join them.' Bent's agent did not respond to a request for comment. Bent also had an Audi RS6 (similar to the one pictured) stolen from his home during the burglary . In 2001, then Everton striker Duncan Ferguson (pictured) fought off two burglars from his home . The striker joins a growing list of footballers who have been targeted by criminals. Stoke striker Peter Crouch and his wife Abbey Clancy have also been the victims of two break-ins. The couple were said to be 'distraught' after thieves broke into their Cheshire home and turned the house upside down looking for jewellery in 2011. Entering through a kitchen window, the criminals made off with a number of rings, thought to belong to Clancy, as well as a watch and a laptop computer. And in 2010, Martin Wilson, 22, admitted to his role in the burglary of Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard's home. Gerrard's wife Alex Curran was home with the couple's children when Wilson and the gang smashed into their home, threatening to take her children if she did not hand over jewellery and cash. Gerrard was in Marseille at the time playing in a Liverpool Champions League tie. Former Scottish footballer Duncan Ferguson also famously detained a man who broke into his home in Rufford, near Liverpool. Playing for Everton at the time, the striker confronted the pair of thieves. Although one managed to flee, his partner in crime spent three days in hospital after having been detained by Ferguson until police arrived. Police are warning homes using cylinder locks, like those the thieves broke at Darren Bent's home, are extremely vulnerable to burglary. A practice known as 'lock snapping' has been disseminated among criminals whereby  locks featuring a cylinder are able to be easily snapped. Once broken and removed, thieves can then manipulate the locking mechanism and open the door. Sergeant Richard Morris of Staffordshire Police said Bent's break-in highlighted the pitfalls of cylinder locks on windows. He said: 'Thieves have devised methods of snapping these types of cylinders locks in a matter of seconds while still being able to operate the lock to open the door. 'They’re then able to look for the keys to the cars they’ve seen outside and drive them away. 'This threat can be reduced simply by upgrading the cylinder to one that is specifically designed to prevent this method of attack. We recommend that all vulnerable doors using Euro-Profile cylinder locks be upgraded to incorporate ‘Break Secure’ cylinders.'

"Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes has revealed he played one of the seven dwarfs during the club's pantomime show when he was an apprentice. United's youth players put on a festive show for the senior stars in the run up to Christmas when Scholes was a teenager. Scholes, writing in his column for the Independent, was joined by team-mates Gary Neville, David Beckham and Nicky Butt for the Christmas production. 'At Manchester United there is an old Christmas tradition that the apprentices – as we were known in my teenage years – put on a pantomime show for the first team full of jokes at the expense of the senior players,' revealed Scholes.

Scholes progressed through Manchester United's youth team alongside fellow midfielder Beckham . 'You could say it was a formative experience for me: I was one of the seven dwarfs. When I look back at it, the other dwarfs included Gary Neville, David Beckham and Nicky Butt, although sadly I cannot recall which of us was Dopey. 'The point of the exercise was to make a bit of a fool of yourself in front of your team-mates, no bad thing when it comes to breaking down the insecurities and rivalries in a group of teenage boys. We also loved the wicked jokes about the first-team players. 'That tradition continued right up to my retirement and I always enjoyed the reaction on the faces of some of the biggest names at United when they realised it was them being sent up by the young lads.' Scholes also backed Manchester City to beat Barcelona in the last 16 of the Champions League and stated his belief that Chelsea, who face Paris Saint-Germain, have the most difficult tie of the round.

"Marouane Fellaini insists he never lost the belief that he could cut it at Manchester United and says Louis van Gaal has been 'fantastic' for him. The Belgian midfielder became synonymous with United's struggles in a disastrous 2013-14 season under David Moyes, who was sacked in April. At £27.5million, Fellaini was Moyes' only signing in the summer of 2013 but he struggled badly with form and fitness as United could only finish seventh in the Premier League. Marouane Fellaini closes down Liverpool star Raheem Sterling during Manchester United's 3-0 win on Sunday . The Belgian was David Moyes' first signing as United manager back in August 2013 . This season has seen Fellaini play a starring role under Van Gaal, however, as United have recorded six successive wins to move up to third. 'Some of the newspapers said that Van Gaal didn't want me, but I knew the truth,' the 27-year-old told The Times. 'When he spoke to me he told me that he wanted me to show him that I could play. 'That was it. After that, I showed myself in training and then I started to play. Fellaini gets to grips with Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard as United recorded their sixth straight win .

"Kevin Pietersen insisted he would listen to any offer to return as England selectors met on Friday to decide which players are set for World Cup duty. The batsman's international career looks to be over after he was ditched from the England set-up following last winter's heavy Ashes defeat, and went on to write a controversial autobiography. But Pietersen wrote on Twitter as the selectors prepared to mull their options that his 'phone is on' and, in response to a fellow user asking if he would take a call from the national team management, he replied: 'Of course!' Kevin Pietersen fired a blistering 66 for Melbourne Stars in Australia's Big Bash League . Pietersen was top scorer and has said he would answer a call to play for England at next year's World Cup . Pietersen made a rapid 66 for Melbourne Stars in the opening match of the Big Bash League, showing the 34-year-old can still be a formidable performer. Whether or not Pietersen's name comes up at all, it seems certain he will not be included in England's 16-man squad for the Tri-series in Australia next month, which also features the home side and India. That squad must be trimmed to 15 players for the World Cup, with the key issue facing the selectors being whether to retain Alastair Cook as captain. Alastair Cook faces increased speculation around his future as England one-day captain due to poor form . Cook is taking nothing for granted as the selectors consider all aspects of England's 5-2 defeat in Sri Lanka as part of their scheduled series review, before making the announcement of their touring squad on Saturday morning. The England captain, who is struggling with his batting, has conceded he has no 'divine right' to be selected to lead the team to the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand early next year. However ECB managing director Paul Downton has hinted strongly that Cook, who turns 30 on Christmas Day, is highly likely to retain leadership responsibilities.","Kevin Pietersen blasted 66 off 46 balls for Melbourne Stars on Thursday .

"Harry Redknapp will have to deal in the loan market in January as he looks to bring in reinforcements at Loftus Road. The QPR manager travelled to Malaysia during the week for a meeting with owner Tony Fernandes, flying out on Wednesday evening and returning early on Friday. Head of football operations Les Ferdinand and Chris Ramsey from the club's academy also joined the group to discuss all things related to the club - but, if Redknapp was hoping to come back with news of a transfer window kitty, he would have been sorely disappointed. Harry Redknapp talks to the assembled media on Friday ahead of QPR's clash against West Brom . Having overseen the signings of 10 players ahead of the closure of the summer window, Redknapp has been unable to keep the newly-promoted R's out of the relegation zone - they currently reside in 18th place in the Barclays Premier League. Many teams are expected to be shopping around to bolster their squads in the new year but the 67-year-old admits he will only be looking for temporary moves. 'It was good,' he said of his Far-East chat with Fernandes. 'I went over to see Tony and Ruben (Emir Gnanalingam) - two of the owners. We had a good, positive meeting talking about players, new stadium, training ground. It was well worth going. 'He's busy so I went over... we just discussed lots of different aspects of the club. We had a good day. It was interesting. Holland international midfielder Leroy Fer (right) was one of several big-money signings last summer . 'We're not looking to spend. If there's a loan or two out there we would be interested, that's where we are at. We spent some money in the summer, so we're not that far short. 'Hopefully we can find another striker to add to the ones we've got already, so that's an area we are looking at. 'In January it's always difficult to find players. We will see. There will be someone out there that can come and help us.' Redknapp moved to rule out two potential swoops, as he poured cold water on reports he was looking to link up with Peter Crouch or Jermain Defoe once again. 'Mark (Hughes, Stoke boss) says they are looking to give him a new contract,' he said of Crouch. Redknapp is an admirer of Peter Crouch (centre) but says Stoke are not willing to let him leave the club . 'He belongs to Stoke and we've never discussed that with them. He's a good player. He belongs to Stoke and they want to keep him, so that's not a goer really. Defoe is an excellent player but I don't know if he fits in our budget.' A 3-1 defeat at Everton on Monday night means QPR have not picked up a point away from home this season but they have looked strong at Loftus Road and will fancy their chances against fellow relegation candidates West Brom on Saturday. Top goalscorer Charlie Austin returns from suspension and defender Steven Caulker is also back having also sat out the loss at Goodison Park following the head injury he suffered at the players' Christmas gathering. But Redknapp will have to make do without Juventus loanee Mauricio Isla, with the defender returning to his native Chile to be present at the birth of his child. Redknapp is not hopeful of concluding a deal to bring Jermain Defoe back to England from Toronto FC .","Harry Redknapp met with QPR owner Tony Fernandes this week .

"Brendan Rodgers is unlikely to be given money to spend to boost his Liverpool squad in January - putting paid to his hopes of signing Fabian Delph. Liverpool remain in the mix for the Villa midfielder, with Tottenham also in the frame, but any deal will be a free transfer in the summer. Rodgers still wants a new goalkeeper and a striker to turn his side's dismal season around, but is most likely to dip into the loan market. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Brendan Rodgers: I'm not thinking about January transfers . Without a January transfer budget Liverpool may have to put a move for Aston Villa's Fabian Delph on hold . Interest in Delph has become more intense following Emre Can's disappointing start to his Liverpool career .

"Australia fly-half Quade Cooper believes a few rounds of boxing in the ring might help to keep him away from trouble outside it. Cooper will feature alongside dual code international Sonny Bill Williams and Australian rugby league veteran Paul Gallen in a 'Footy Show Fight Night' in Sydney on January 31 for his third professional bout. Like Williams, whose fights have not been universally popular in his home country of New Zealand, Cooper's enthusiasm for boxing has been tolerated rather than welcomed by the Australian Rugby Union. Quade Cooper (left) and Sonny Bill Williams appear in front of the media in Sydney on Friday . Cooper's third professional bout will take place in Sydney on January 31 . But Cooper said Wallabies coach Michael Cheika had thrown his support behind him, offering to buy him a pair of gloves. 'I looked at it as a different way to do some fitness,' Cooper said. 'I was going to look at finding a gym and do some boxing anyway and Cheika just hit me up and said he'll go buy some gloves. 'To me, that was him reaching out. He knew it was something that I enjoyed doing and he went out of his comfort zone to help me improve at something that I enjoy doing.' Though Cooper's vocal criticism of former coach Robbie Deans' playing style landed him in hot water a couple of years ago, the 26-year-old has had a clean record off-field in recent seasons, in contrast to his strife-filled early playing days. The Australia fly-half is tackled by England's Brad Barritt at Twickenham last month . All Blacks centre Sonny Bill Williams takes on Gary Gurr in Brisbane back in 2009 . Cooper was arrested for stealing laptops from a Gold Coast house after his first Wallabies tour and also had other disciplinary problems.

'After my first tour, I got into a bit of trouble because all I wanted to do was drink alcohol,' he said. 'So it's great having another outlet to help me stay fit and focused. 'The difficult part is seeing everybody else go on holidays but understanding this is my choice. 'I think (boxing) benefits me not only as an athlete but as a person... this is pretty much the most difficult time to be able to stay focused on any kind of working out.'

"Behind the super-confident exterior, John Guidetti is a romantic at heart. The things he truly values in life are beyond the reach of money. It is why the Swedish scoring sensation insists he can imagine forsaking greater riches elsewhere to stay at Celtic once his season-long loan is finished. All he wants for now is to concentrate on extending the superb form recognised with receipt of the SPFL Player of the Month award for October. John Guidetti has been in fine form for Celtic since joining the Scottish side on a season-long loan deal . The Swedish international was named the SPFL player of the month for October . When decision time comes, however, Guidetti is adamant that the numbers on his contract will be secondary to the number of goals he could score in the right environment. An adoring audience is already being created at Parkhead, where fans have long been desperate to savour a forward with real star quality. Guidetti, as prolific in press conferences as he is on the pitch, has delivered sackfuls of the stuff since moving north from Manchester City. The 22-year-old’s contract at the Etihad expires at the end of the season. After nine goals in his first nine Celtic appearances, every further strike will heighten demands from supporters to keep him in Glasgow on a more permanent basis. It will be no easy task. Guidetti is thought to earn in the region of £40,000 per week at City. That is significantly more than Celtic’s best-paid player, but well within the reach of a middling English Premier League side impressed by his return to fitness and form. Compromises will inevitably have to be made if Parkhead is to become his longer-term home, but Guidetti has declared himself open to all possibilities. Guidetti's current deal at Manchester City is due to expire at the end of the season . ‘Of course I can see myself here next year,’ he insisted. ‘You can always see yourself at a club like this. It’s an amazing football club. ‘I want to thank the fans for being so kind to me. They put a bit of pressure on me last week by singing my name even before I scored! ‘I thought, “s**t, now I have to score!” Thankfully I did, but I have to be thankful to my team-mates and to the whole club. Everyone has been amazing. ‘If it’s the right thing then it is the right thing. I don’t think money has anything to do with it. As long as you can put food on the table and support your family. ‘Of course this is my job and you want to be financially stable, but you are going to be at a club like this. ‘You have to look at all the options and see what is there. I need to put myself in a good position by playing well. Celtic want me to play well also and just focus on this year. It’s my agent’s job at the end of the season.’ Two years ago, a virus attacked Guidetti’s nervous system and almost cost him the ability to play football. Inevitably, the huge stress of that experience — which left him hosptialised and cost him a place at Euro 2012 — has shaped his outlook. Three seasons after an exceptional loan spell at Feyenoord, the return of regular action with Celtic has been a genuine delight. ‘For me, my dream is to play in the biggest games possible and do well, play for my country, win trophies and have a heck of a good time,’ he added. ‘When you look back you are not going to think that was a nice day when I signed that bonus cheque. It’s about saying, “that goal was a beauty”. ‘When you are talking to your three-year-old grandkids, you want to show them a nice goal on YouTube. ‘I would give any amount of money to score a goal and celebrate. It’s the best feeling in the world. ‘The most important thing for me is just to keep getting games under my belt and to smash it — to do the best that I can, never stop and try to improve by working my ass off. ‘I want to embrace this year because I think it is going to be amazing. We have high hopes and I think we can achieve them. ‘To be told you might never play football again to this point where I’m player of the month with Celtic — that’s a big contrast. ‘I never thought what I would do if I had to stop playing football. I would be finished as a person. I would not exist. Me without football is nothing.’ Guidetti is keen on helping Celtic challenge for trophies before making a decision on his future . The 22-year-old has revealed he dreams of playing in front of a packed Celtic Park . Guidetti has already boldly declared his intention to help Celtic towards a clean sweep of trophies, believing the Europa League should be targeted alongside a domestic Treble. Eleven years have passed since the Parkhead club last reached a continental final but Guidetti —ineligible until the knockout phase — is motivated by dreams of reprising the famous UEFA Cup run forged by Martin O’Neill’s side. ‘The boys told me all about Seville,’ he smiled. ‘They told me it would be nice to go far in the Europa League because, back then, it was unbelievable. ‘They told me how there were 30,000 fans in the stadium and 80,000 in Seville. I just thought “wow”. The airline companies much have done well that week! ‘Who wouldn’t imagine days like Seville? I can even imagine being part of the 80,000 walking up the street singing! I would like that as well. ‘My dream this year is to see a full Celtic Park with 60,000 people. Don’t get me wrong, the atmosphere has been amazing, but I am shocked to hear it can be even better. ‘I want to see a sell-out and have goose bumps and the hair on the back of my neck standing up when I score a goal. That’s one of my goals for this year. ‘I am looking forward to everything. I have heard it will be a great atmosphere against Aberdeen this weekend and a great buzz. ‘Hearts away (in the Scottish Cup) will just be an amazing atmosphere, too, and I don’t even need to talk about the Rangers game. ‘These are the games I love, matches that are a bit tasty with a few yellow cards going around.’","Manchester City striker John Guidetti has impressed since joining Celtic .

"Angel di Maria could return to the Manchester United squad at Aston Villa after recovering from the slight hamstring tear that has kept him out of the last three games. United’s record £59.7million signing has trained with the first team this week and is ready to add to Louis van Gaal’s attacking options as the Dutchman looks to extend his winning run to seven games. But the United boss will not rush Di Maria back too quickly and has warned him that, like Radamel Falcao, he may have to be patient.

Manchester United striker Robin van Persie gets on the ball while Phil Jones looks on in the background . Van Gaal said: ‘Angel di Maria has trained this week with us so it’s always dependable how I have to compare with other players because he is not match fit after one week. 'What I’ve said about Robin van Persie and Falcao I also say about Di Maria. It’s a procedure and he has to follow it. Maybe I shall select him for the bench and maybe not. We have one training session to go.’ Falcao has scored one goal in 11 games and struggled to win a first-team place due to injury. Van Gaal has previously said that the Colombia star was only able to play 20 minutes before stepping up his fitness in training, and refused to be drawn on whether he will start at Villa Park. ‘He didn't play so much and then you cannot see too much of a player,’ said Van Gaal. ‘And he didn't train so much because he was injured a lot of the time so first you have to be fit. ‘I said three weeks or a month ago, the first demand is fitness of a player. And OK, we wait for the fitness of a player. Now he shows fitness in the training sessions so maybe I shall select him, maybe for the bench or the line-up. Wait and see.’ Van Gaal was left bemused after his weekly press conference at Manchester United’s Carrington training base on Friday was interrupted by a tannoy announcement calling for a masseur.

It’s a joke?’ The United boss was reassured that the announcement was genuine but should not have been heard in the press conference room. The Old Trafford boss also became irritated when asked about Victor Valdes, and whether Liverpool could revive their interest in the former Barcelona goalkeeper if United do not offer him a contract. ‘It's only talk from you,’ said Van Gaal. ‘Not from us, not from Victor Valdes, not from no-one, only the media. I am not here to inform the media. You have to wait and listen and see and that's it. ‘OK, then he goes to Liverpool. Yeah, when you see that. But you are suggesting and it's a big mistake to do that as the media. There are no stories. He is training here.

But the Arsenal manager believes much has changed in 10 months since, not least the exit of Suarez, an injury to Daniel Sturridge and his coup to sign Alexis Sanchez from Barcelona ahead of Brendan Rodgers.

Wenger’s team were four down in 20 minutes when they travelled to Merseyside in February . Raheem Sterling puts Liverpool into a 2-0 lead against Arsenal at Anfield last season . Wenger said: 'Liverpool scored over hundred goals later year. They were very good going forward. This season they have scored 19, so they are not on the same trend offensively. They started out strong that day and we were too late to get into the game. 'Every defeat hurts, you know. Every defeat is a scar in your heart for ever. But we have good memories at Liverpool. We won many games there. A week later against the same team we won at home in the FA Cup. 'I expect to play a very good team. They have a heavy schedule like us and it’s very demanding. 'I have respect for the crowd at Liverpool because they stand behind their team. It’s one of the few grounds in the world where you see that. There is a special combination at Liverpool of knowledge of the game and support of their team.' The Gunners boss claims Liverpool 'are not on the same trend offensively' this season . Wenger also revealed that he didn't have to try particularly hard to convince star signing Alexis Sanchez to move to the Emirates. The Chile forward has scored nine goals in 16 Premier League games for the season so far and has been Wenger's most consistent performer. The Frenchman said: 'Every great player has the choice to play where he wants and he chose us. We're very happy. 'I told him the way we play football will suit him and all players want to play in the Champions League.'

Arsene Wenger admits defeat was a 'scar on the heart'"
"Stand by for 360 minutes of festive football action which could define the season. Title-chasers Chelsea and Manchester City will be wanting to put more distance between themselves and the pack while Manchester United continue to snap away at their heels. Arsenal have some ground to make up and there is also the intriguing question of whether West Ham and Southampton can sustain their surprise challenge. Christmas tends to sort out the men from the boys, after all. Four games, 13 days. While the nation sits on its collective backside, gorging, can the Barclays Premier League provide a feast of another kind? Here are Sportsmail’s predictions - eat your heart out Mystic Meg. Jose Mourinho (left) and Louis van Gaal will be taking their sides through a hectic festive period . Manuel Pellegrini will be looking to reduce the three-point deficit to Premier League leaders Chelsea . APPETISERS: Saturday, December 20 - Monday December 22 . Saturday December 20 . Manchester City vs Crystal Palace (12.45pm kick-off, BT Sport 1) Sunday December 21 . Newcastle United vs Sunderland (1.30pm kick-off, Sky Sports 1) Liverpool vs Arsenal (4pm kick-off, SS1) Monday December 22 . Stoke City vs Chelsea (8pm kick-off, SS1) It is the weekend before Christmas and legs will still be relatively fresh. Manchester City arguably have the ‘easiest’ matches - Crystal Palace, West Bromwich Albion, Burnley and Sunderland - but they must first overcome the challenge of having no fit striker. The round of games kick off with City vs Palace on Saturday lunchtime. Sergio Aguero and his 14 goals will be missing, as will fellow forwards Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic. Maybe Frank Lampard could do a job there, after all he has scored goals already. Palace, two successive draws behind them, will be relying on the wizardry of Yannick Bolasie before he departs on Africa Cup of Nations duty, but it is hard to see anything but a City win. Sergio Aguero will not feature for Manchester City during the busy Christmas period due to injury . Frank Lampard will be expected to continue to take some of the goalscoring burden for City . Saturday afternoon looms in importance for Southampton, who have lost five matches in a row, including the Capital One Cup quarter-final against League One Sheffield United. Ronald Koeman’s team last won at the start of November (2-0 against Leicester City) and next up are Everton, whose form has been flaky. West Ham have been ticking along very nicely recently with three wins and a draw while Leicester have to go back to September for their last victory. Nigel Pearson’s team will do well to come away with anything, especially if Diafra Sakho is in the mood, not to mention Andy Carroll. West Ham United forward Andy Carroll (left) will be key to their chances of maintaining their form . Then there is Manchester United, who boast an extraordinary record against Aston Villa. The last time Villa beat United at home in the league was the opening day of the 1995-96 season. In the last five matches against Louis van Gaal’s team, Villa have conceded 17 goals. Expect them to put up the shutters, batten down the hatches and double-bolt the front door, which could be a tester for in-form skipper Wayne Rooney. Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney will look to fire his side to victory against Aston Villa . Arsenal, pilloried a fortnight ago after losing at Stoke City, go to old foes Liverpool. Revenge will be on Arsene Wenger’s mind after last season’s 5-1 thrashing at Anfield and two successive four-goal hauls (Galatasaray and Newcastle United) will fuel optimism. Olivier Giroud’s double against Newcastle suggests he is getting better every game, too. And finally Chelsea, who head to the Britannia Stadium on Monday night. Jose Mourinho’s team will be up for a cold night in the Potteries and they will be trying to forget last year’s 3-2 shock defeat. Stoke have conceded 10 goals at home in five games - Diego Costa and Eden Hazard could have a field day. Olivier Giroud (left) celebrates scoring against Newcastle United - he will look to keep hitting the net . Diego Costa must return to the lethal form he showed earlier this season if Chelsea are to succeed . Manchester City 2-0 Crystal Palace . Aston Villa 0-2 Manchester United . Southampton 1-1 Everton . West Ham United 2-1 Leicester City . Liverpool 1-2 Arsenal . Stoke City 1-1 Chelsea . Turkey and all the trimmings: Boxing Day (Friday December 26) Boxing Day (Friday December 26) Chelsea vs West Ham United (12.45pm kick-off, Sky Sports 1) Manchester United vs Newcastle United (3.00pm kick-off, BT Sport 1) Arsenal vs Queens Park Rangers (5.30pm kick-off, BT Sport 1) The perfect way to recover from the gluttony of Christmas Day - a London derby between Chelsea and West Ham at lunchtime on Boxing Day. This is the time of year when injuries and rotation play an important part and Mourinho could well make the point his players have had 48 hours less to recover than the Hammers. West Ham drew 0-0 at Stamford Bridge last season but have not scored there in their previous three Premier League visits. Koeman gets his first taste of no-winter-break action when he takes Southampton to Palace. He will have the next fixtures against Chelsea and Arsenal in the back of his mind so will that mean resting players? Probably not, having lost to Burnley last week. He needs points and goals from Graziano Pelle (one in eight games). Palace will hope to have Marouane Chamakh fit again. Graziano Pelle must start finding the back of the net again if Southampton are to stay in the top six . Crystal Palace's Mauroane Chamakh (right) evades the challenge of Stoke City's Mame Biram Diouf . Manchester United are at home to Newcastle where Rooney, seven-goal Robin van Persie and five-goal Juan Mata may expect to make the most out of Alan Pardew’s goalkeeper worries. United fans will remember too well that they lost this fixture 1-0 last season. Relegation-fighting West Brom face Manchester City and will regard a point as a massive achievement, especially if they beat Queens Park Rangers on Saturday. Expect Pellegrini to rotate and to win. QPR, meanwhile, have the job of putting a spoke in Arsenal’s wheel in the late afternoon kick-off. Robin van Persie has netted seven goals this season and will look to add to that  against Newcastle United . Alan Pardew is facing a goalkeeper crisis and will have to continue to play 21-year-old Jak Alnwick . Chelsea 1-0 West Ham United . Crystal Palace 0-0 Southampton . Manchester United 3-1 Newcastle United . West Bromwich Albion 1-3 Manchester City . Arsenal 2-1 Queens Park Rangers . Christmas leftovers: Sunday December 28-Monday 29 . Sunday December 28 . Tottenham Hotspur vs Manchester United (12.00pm kick-off, BT Sport 1) Southampton vs Chelsea (2.05pm kick-off, Sky Sports 1) Newcastle United vs Everton (4.15pm kick-off, Sky Sports 1) Monday December 29 . Liverpool vs Swansea City (8.00pm kick-off, Sky Sports 1) Barely 48 hours after turning out on Boxing Day, weary bodies will need to be dragged out of bed for another round of matches. With fatigue settling in, mistakes are more likely, not to mention injuries. Midday kick-off sees LVG take United to White Hart Lane. Working on the basis that Tottenham Hotspur will have gained a few points from the fixtures against Burnley and Leicester, Mauricio Pochettino’s side could easily have built up a head of steam for this one.More importantly for stats watchers, Spurs have not lost to United in their last four Premier League meetings. Chelsea head to the south coast where Southampton currently hold the record of joint meanest defence in the Premier League with, er, Chelsea. Can Nacer Chadli and Tottenham Hotspur beat Man United at White Hart Lane over Christmas? Chelsea's defence, including captain John Terry, is the joint-meanest in the league alongside Southampton . Both have conceded just 13 so far, which would suggest a goalless draw, except that the Saints’ recent poor run has included losing to Man United, City and Arsenal. City take on the ginger Mourinho - Sean Dyche - and Burnley will be up for this one. Whether or not Danny Ings will get a look-in is another matter entirely. Then there is another London derby with the Hammers hosting Arsenal. On paper this could be a cracker. Danny Ings (centre) will hope to upset the odds and lead Burnley to an unlikely win over Man City . Alexis Sanchez could be the star attraction in the mouthwatering clash between Arsenal and West Ham . Tottenham Hotspur 1-1 Manchester United . Southampton 1-1 Chelsea . Manchester City 3-0 Burnley . West Ham United 2-2 Arsenal . Champagne time: New Year's Day (Thursday January 1) New Year's Day (Thursday January 1) Stoke City vs Manchester United (12.45pm kick-off, Sky Sports 1) Manchester City vs Sunderland (3.00pm kick-off, BT Sport 1) Tottenham Hotspur vs Chelsea (5.30pm kick-off, BT Sport 1) Clear heads will be the order of the day on what is another annual quirk of the match list. Just a month after these teams met, it is time for the reverse fixture, which means grudges can still be held and revenge may be a motivating factor. Marouane Fellaini and Juan Mata scored the goals for Man United in their 2-1 win at Old Trafford at the start of December but Stoke have a habit of rising to the occasion at the Britannia. This will be a tricky lunchtime match on New Year’s Day. Juan Mata has already netted against Stoke this season and he will look to do so again . Bojan and the rest of the Potters side will host Man United confident they can get a result, though . The same could be said for Chelsea, who will hope to feed off the recent 3-0 win against Tottenham. Goals from Eden Hazard, Didier Drogba and Loic Remy made it miserable for Spurs and could make it miserable again for them in the tea-time kick-off. Koeman felt robbed at the last-minute Alexis Sanchez winner which gave Arsenal victory over Southampton at the Emirates but it is another mammoth ask for his players after the Chelsea game on December 28. Unfinished business might be the order of the day for West Brom too, as they travel to Upton Park. West Ham won 2-1 at The Hawthorns at the start of the month, thanks to goals from Kevin Nolan and James Tomkins. It was a match where Albion bossed possession but showed their lack of a cutting edge. Expectations could be the Hammers’ undoing. Eden Hazard (right) takes on Derby County's Richard Keogh for Chelsea in the Capital One Cup .

"A teenager has been arrested over a brutal attack which left boxing world title hopeful Anthony Crolla in hospital with a fractured skull and broken ankle. Police said that a 17-year-old boy is being questioned in custody on suspicion of burglary, assault and possession with intent to supply drugs in connection with the incident. Crolla, 28, was hit over the head with a concrete slab after being attacked while chasing two people away from his neighbour's home at around 5.30pm on Tuesday in Chadderton, Greater Manchester. Anthony Crolla and girlfriend Fran Sanderson pose as the boxer recovers in hospital . Crolla had surgery on his right ankle which was broken in two places after the attack . The likeable Mancunian fighter is said to be recovering well from his injuries in hospital. But his long-awaited world title shot against Richard Abril on January 23 has been scrapped and his trainer Joe Gallagher is unsure whether he will even be able to box again. The assault happened when two burglars climbed into the back garden of Crolla's neighbour and broke into the house on Halsey Close. The pair searched the property, which was empty at the time, but left empty-handed. Crolla was due to fight Richar Abril for the WBA lightweight title next month but that has been shelved . As they climbed back out to the garden they were spotted by the boxer, who shouted for them to stop and then gave chase when they ran. There was a struggle and Crolla was hit over the head with what police described as a 'heavy object', causing him to fall to the floor. Both attackers left the scene. The former British and Commonwealth champion's trainer said: 'We were so grateful for the world title opportunity but that's gone. 'Whether they can reschedule it, whether he'll get the opportunity again and whether he can even ever fight again remain to be seen but first we have to concentrate on getting Anthony back to full health.' A 46-year-old woman has also been arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply drugs in connection with the matter. Crolla lands a punch on John Murray on his way to victory over his close friend in Manchester this year . Anyone with information is asked to phone police on 0161 856 9035 or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.","Anthony Crolla is in hospital with a fractured skull and broken ankle .

"Jose Mourinho has urged Eden Hazard to make himself a Chelsea legend after confirming the forward will sign a bumper new contract. As Sportsmail revealed in September, the Belgium international will pen a new five-year deal worth in the region of £200,000-per-week - cementing his position as one of the club's top earners. His contract is a reward for a string of brilliant performances for the Blues since his arrival in 2012. VIDEO Scroll down for Jose Mourinho: Eden Hazard will sign a new contract . Belgian playmaker Eden Hazard will sign a new contract at Chelsea, claims boss Jose Mourinho . Hazard has been a key player for Chelsea since he joined  in 2012 and has flourished under Mourinho . Mourinho believes Hazard must win the Premier League title to become a Chelsea great . But Mourinho insists there is much more to come from his diminutive forward, insisting Hazard can become a Stamford Bridge legend. However, the Special one claims Hazard can only be considered a Blues great once he starts adding to his trophy tally. 'He will sign, I was never worried about it, since the moment I met his father,' said the Blues boss. 'Everything was very clear about their intentions and their happiness to stay at Chelsea. Mourinho will take his side to play Stoke on Monday as the Blues look to stay top of the Premier League . 'After that, it becomes a numbers situation. When it becomes a number situation I'm more than happy to be out, but my club always told me that the situation would finish with a new contract. 'Can he become one of Chelsea's all-time greats? I think so. He needs to win titles, because titles make players historic. 'I don't know players who are considered legends in clubs without winning titles. He has to do that. But the potential, everybody knows.' Meanwhile, Thibault Courtois is set to be available for Monday's clash against Stoke after missing last weekend's win over Hull with a groin injury. Thibaut Courtois is set to return to the Chelsea side for Monday's game against Stoke . Petr Cech (left) is expected to make way for the returning Courtois . It means Petr Cech is set to find himself back on the bench for the Barclays Premier League encounter against Mark Hughes' men, despite keeping a clean sheet against Steve Bruce's side. But Mourinho insists he won't find it any harder to drop the Czech Republic goalkeeper following his display last weekend. The Portuguese added: 'Had Petr made it a tougher decision? No. Petr's performances are the normal performances from one of the three best goalkeepers in the world, so simple.'","Eden Hazard set to sign new five-year deal with Chelsea .

"Louis van Gaal says that he is looking for the ‘perfect game’ from Manchester United – and does not agree with Sir Alex Ferguson that results are all that matter. United are on a run of six straight wins as they prepare to face Aston Villa on Saturday, but the Dutchman is still demanding a better level of performance from his players. ‘I’m not only focused on results though of course that’s the main thing,’ said Van Gaal. ‘When I speak to Sir Alex he says “what’s the problem, you’ve won”. But when you perform well you shall win more and that’s what I want to show to the fans, and the players want it also. The guarantee of wins is better when you perform better.’ VIDEO Scroll down to watch Louis van Gaal: I disagree with Sir Alex, performance matters . Robin van Persie (right) looks to control the ball as Manchester United train at Carrington on Friday . Radamel Falcao (centre) is pushing for a start after regaining his fitness following injury . Louis van Gaal has steered his Manchester United side to six Premier League wins on the spin . ‘For example, the game against Hull was a good game. We dominated for 90 minutes and I want to see more games like that. There are too few games we are dominating 90 minutes. That’s the process. We have to wait and see but, of course, when you win six times a row then the confidence is rising. ‘I’m still looking for a game that is closer to the perfect game that we’ve given until now.’ Asked if last weekend’s 3-0 win at home to Liverpool had given his players a big confidence boost, Van Gaal claimed that it was no ‘great surprise’ that they beat their old rivals. Van Gaal revealed that he has spoken to Sir Alex Ferguson about United's performances . Wayne Rooney is mobbed after scoring Manchester United's opener against Liverpool on Sunday . United have had to rely heavily on the form of goalkeeper David de Gea during their six-game winning streak . He added: ‘I don't think that one game had a big influence until now because, okay, the results are very good but we can improve the performances as a team. ‘I am always speaking about the team. I think that the team can improve itself still more and I don't think that it was a great surprise that we won against Liverpool, neither did the players.’ The trip to Villa Park is the first of five games in 15 days for United. Van Gaal has already complained about having to play so much over Christmas but was reluctant to look ahead to the rest of his team’s festive fixture list. Record signing Angel di Maria could return to United's squad, Van Gaal also revealed . ‘It’s game 17, it’s not a game inbetween, the first of five,’ he said. ‘So you can make another division. It’s game 17 in a process. ‘I think we don't have to talk about the games after that. We have to talk about Aston Villa. When you see the last matches, Aston Villa haven’t lost so much, they draw, they win, and when they lose it’s always with one goal difference. So it shall be very difficult.

"With much fanfare and theatrics, Etihad has unveiled its brand new flagship aircraft, the behemoth Airbus A380, which boasts the world's only penthouse in the sky, and the Boeing B787 Dreamliner. Stepping onto the A380 is more like arriving at a chichi business hotel than a plane. Even the galley is like an elegant reception with chocolate brown and champagne-hued décor and ‘food and beverage managers’ looking as if they’re about to go to a ball. Turning left (something most of us never do on an aircraft) and ascending to the upper deck, one is taken straight to the airline’s piece de resistance: The Residence – a 125-square-foot, three-room private suite, which comes with a Savoy-trained butler and, according to the airline bosses, is already booked up and has had encouraging sales so far. Scroll down for video . The Residence is a one-of-a-kind, three-room suite that costs £12,500 for a one-way flight . In addition to a bedroom, The Residence boasts a private ensuite bathroom (pictured) and living room . Journalists tour the first class section on Etihad Airways' new Boeing B787 Dreamliner at Abu Dhabi airport . A journalist sits in one of the first class suites on Etihad Airways' Boeing B787 Dreamliner . Etihad has unveiled its revolutionary Airbus A380, with the interior more like a luxury hotel than a plane . The living room is suitably glamorous, with gold cushions strewn over a leather-clad sofa; and the shower and bathroom put other airline facilities to shame. Guests will certainly avoid the usual hold-your-nose-and-think-of-England approach needed in most airborne lavatories. And it’s hard to believe a double bed can fit on a plane, even the gargantuan A380. But there it is, beckoning weary and heavy-walleted travellers into its comfy fold. But it’s all actually a little smaller than one might imagine, so as well as a seven-figure salary you'll require a relatively trim physique to enjoy it. The airline declined to comment on who is on the waiting list to fly in The Residence but with the hefty one-way price tag of £12,500 for single or double occupancy, the names Mr and Mrs Beckham spring to mind. Super-rich, celebrities, perhaps even royalty will grace this quite unreal space – a design feat unchallenged by any other airline. Guests who book The Residence wake up to breakfast in bed and have their own private living room . Etihad Airways says The Residence has sold out for its initial flights between London and Abu Dhabi . Etihad's Boeing B787 Dreamliner will enter commercial service with a flight from Abu Dhabi to Dusseldorf . Etihad's Airbus A380 offers the world's first penthouse in the sky - but costs £12,500 each way . Peter Baumgartner, Chief Commercial Officer of the United Arab Emirates' national airline, said: ‘For a three-room cabin, it’s not overpriced. Effectively it’s four times the price of a first class ticket, so that’s double if you’re travelling in a couple.’ To regain its prestige, The Residence will not be available for upgrade. ‘It would lose its aspirational value,’ said Baumgartner. The A380 is also the only Etihad aircraft to offer the new First Apartment – a complete living space with reclining lounge chair and an ottoman which opens up to become a separate 80.5-inch fully flat bed. New gig: On Saturday Nicole Kidman was announced as be the new face of Etihad Airways . First class passengers can get total privacy, but if they’re travelling together – or just want to get a little closer to their neighbour – the centre seats can be joined to create a double bed. In economy, the seats are no bigger with no added legroom, but passengers will benefit from revolutionary new pillows, which split in half to become comfortable travel pillows. The A380 enters commercial service on December 27 with daily flights between Abu Dhabi and London Heathrow Airport. Journalists tour the first class cabin of a Dreamliner, which enters commercial service in February . The economy class cabin on Etihad's new A380 feature ergonomically-designed seats for added comfort . The A380 is also the only Etihad Aircraft to offer the new First Apartment – a complete living space . Etihad presented its new aircraft during a glitzy event at Abu Dhabi's airport, where 200 members of the press gathered in a hangar draped in black. With a spectacular curtain drop, the A380 was unveiled to the sound of Richard Strauss’ Sprach Zarathustra. The big event showcased The Residence, Etihad's revamped first class and business suites as well as a slightly tweaked economy cabin, and the carrier’s fancy new livery – a mixture of ‘desert’ inspired browns and beiges and new interiors. The unveiling was followed by a fashion show featuring 22 cabin crew, who strutted down a catwalk donning the airline’s brand new uniform. The airline has replaced its steely grey number with an autumnal, slightly seventies get-up designed by Italian haute couturier, Ettore Bilotta. Etihad Chief President and Chief Executive Officer, James Hogan, said: ‘As we have done so many times in our short history, we are reshaping the landscape of modern air travel in our own way. 'Today is the culmination of many years of hard work and tremendous endeavour by hundreds of people both in our airline and outside.' Perfectly suited for the launch of Etihad's new aircraft, the cabin crew showed off their new work attire . Etihad has also revealed a total makeover for its cabin crew, from the classic steely grey skirts and jackets to browns and purples – and most notably, there is no longer a veil attached to female cabin crew’s hats. Chief Commercial Officer, Peter Baumgartner, told MailOnline Travel: ‘The modern Arabic brand is rooted here, from the patterns in the ceiling inspired but the Louvre, we are very respectful of the local culture. ‘Modern Arabia is what is going on in Abu Dhabi, we are inspired by what’s going on in the rest of the world, but through the lens of the local DNA. 'The new uniform designs are an opportunity for us to differentiate ourselves from other airlines – whether there is a veil or not.’ But the brown is not to everyone’s tastes. One female cabin crew member told Mail Online Travel: ‘I like the purple, it’s more colourful than the old uniform. ‘And the brown goes with the new interiors. But with a cabin crew of 124 different nationalities, it’s not going to suit everyone’ While another admitted: ‘When we saw it on the hanger, we weren’t sure.’ Despite mixed opinions, the crew certainly looked impressive, in keeping with what must be one of the most lavish revamps in the history of air travel.","Etihad launch  the behemoth Airbus A380 and the Boeing B787 Dreamliner .

"Prince Charles was all smiles as he joined a festive group of students at a London school this morning but left his Bentley parked outside at a disused bus stop. The prince, 66, was at South Thames College in Wandsworth to meet a group of young people who had just completed a Prince's Trust personal development course - the 300th group trained by the school so far. Luckily for the royal, whose choice of parking spot could have landed him a £70 fine under normal circumstances, the bus stop was out of use. Where's my car? Prince Charles narrowly avoided a £70 fine after leaving his car parked at a bus stop . The prince did, however, get a warm welcome from a family standing at the bus stop and when he asked if they were waiting for transport they replied: 'No, for you Sir'. Once inside, Charles was introduced to teachers and students before cutting into the celebratory 300 themed cake. He then delighted onlookers by tucking into a slice of the tasty-looking cream-filled sponge cake and later joined staff at the school for a cup of coffee. Surrounded by young people who had taken part in the Team programme, the prince paid tribute to their achievements. 'Well done all of you,' he said. 'Thank goodness we've got supporters like you to keep this show on the road.' In a group discussion with those who had been on the course and moved into education or employment, Charles said he was particularly encouraged to see so many like  Matthew Campbell, who have come back to the Trust to help other young people in similar situations. Mr Campbell, 24, was homeless and unemployed when he was introduced to The Prince's Trust in 2012. Lucky escape: Charles heads back to his car - still at the bus stop - following the visit . Not allowed: According to government regulations, there are no exemptions to the no bus stops parking rule . All smiles: Inside, the 66-year-old was all smiles as he met a group of students helped by the Prince's Trust . Celebration: South Thames College has now put 300 groups of students through the Team training course . Tasty: Prince Charles delighted well-wishers by tucking in to a slice of the tasty-looking sponge cake . 'Being a Prince's Trust young ambassador is one of the greatest achievements of my life,' he said, delightedly. 'Thank you, Sir. The confidence and self-esteem I gained has helped me in every part of my life. I have seen how programmes like this can help young people. 'I was homeless and at rock bottom and now I'm living in Surbiton, studying Youth Work at London Met and have come back to volunteer with the Prince's Trust on the same programme that helped me to turn my life around.' This is not Charles' first visit to the school, with the royal having made a previous visit alongside the Duke of Cambridge in 2005. South Thames College's partnership with the Prince's Trust is even older and dates back to 1997 when the college launched its first training course. The 12-week courses are part of a programme operated by the Prince's Trust and aim to boost the skills and confidence of the young unemployed. Passion: To date, Charles' Prince's Trust has put more than 176,000 people through the Team course . Confidence: It aims to give unemployed young people the confidence to find work or go on to university . To date, the Team programme has helped more than 176,335 people - many of whom have taken the course at South Thames College, one of 300 centres to offer it nationwide. So successful has the course been, three in four of those to take it have since moved into work, further education or apprenticeships, the latter also frequently supported by the Prince's Trust. Charles has had a busy period of late and spent yesterday morning at the Cystic Fibrosis Trust where he and Princess Alexandra helped it celebrate its 50th anniversary. During a visit to the Royal Brompton Hospital in London, he chatted to people receiving treatment for the illness and made an impromptu speech praising hospital staff. 'I just want to say, I'm so delighted to have a chance to visit the hospital and the unit here, which I know does such wonderful work on the cystic fibrosis front,' he said. Busy: Charles has had a busy week and spent yesterday morning meeting cystic fibrosis patients . Praise: He also made an impromptu speech praising the work of staff at the Royal Brompton Hospital . 'But also I'm so proud to have become patron of the Cystic Fibrosis Trust in its 50th anniversary year. 'Over all those years I know the Trust has battled in the most remarkable way, together with so many people like yourselves who help to assist patients with this appalling condition. 'I just wanted to use this opportunity not only to salute you all for the work you do, but also to wish all those who I know are doing such good work in finding better and better answers to dealing with this condition every possible success in the future.' Speaking after the visit, Ed Owen, chief executive of Cystic Fibrosis Trust, said: 'As a long-time supporter of people with cystic fibrosis, the prince has a deep understanding of the challenges that people with the condition face, including the daily burden of physiotherapy, nebulisers, dozens of pills and exercise, as well as regular hospital visits and admissions. 'Today less than half of people with cystic fibrosis will die before their 40th birthday, but we are committed to changing this. 'We are redoubling our efforts to beat cystic fibrosis for good, and the prince's support will provide a powerful beacon of hope for all those touched by the condition.'","Charles was visiting South Thames College in Wandsworth this morning .

"When Sir John Hall announced during the 1990s  his vision for Newcastle United to field a team of 11 Geordies at St James' Park in the future, the idea seemed fanciful at best. And, in the two decades since, the Premier League has become an increasingly international game, with young foreign talent squeezing out the opportunities for upcoming local players. Yet, on Sunday, Alan Pardew could send out a Newcastle United XI containing five Tynesiders - the first time that number will have started a match for the Magpies against bitter rivals Sunderland in the history of the Premier League. Midfielder Jack Colback could be one of five Geordies starting for Newcastle against Sunderland . Local lads Sammy Ameobi (left) and Paul Dummett are also set to line up for the Magpies onSunday . Toon keeper Jak Alnwick (centre) has been passed fit for the Tyne-Wear derby . Steven Taylor should be at the heart of the Newcastle defence against their rivals from the North East . There have been 24 Tyne-Wear - or Wear-Tyne - derbies in the Premier League, and never before have five Geordies taken to the field at the beginning of the match clad in black and white. Defenders Paul Dummett and Steven Taylor, winger Sammy Ameobi, midfielder Jack Colback and goalkeeper Jak Alnwick - who has been passed fit to play despite picking up a shoulder injury against Tottenham Hotspur - are all in line to appear at St James' Park in Sunday's 153rd derby.

Newcastle players celebrate against Sunderland in the 3-2 victory at St James' Park in October 2005 - the last time six Geordies featured in a matchday squad for the Magpies against the Black Cats . And, with youngster Adam Armstrong likely to be among the replacements, the Magpies could have six Geordies in their squad against Sunderland for the first time since October 2005. On that day, Newcastle beat Sunderland 3-2 at St James' with the help of Peter Ramage, Shola Ameobi, Lee Clark, Michael Chopra and their favourite Geordie son, Alan Shearer. Taylor also featured in the line-up that day and is the only survivor heading into this weekend. Pardew will be hoping the abundance of Geordie talent will be able to inspire Newcastle and end their miserable recent record against their North East rivals. Shola Ameobi (left) and Peter Beardsley are two Geordies to have played for Newcastle in Tyne-Wear derbies . The Magpies have lost three derbies in succession - two matches at St James' ended 3-0 to the visitors - and have failed to win a home match against the Black Cats since their 5-1 victory on October 31, 2010. Newcastle have never lost four in a row to Sunderland and, following the 4-0 Capital One Cup quarter-final humiliation at Spurs in midweek, another defeat is unlikely to sit well with the Toon Army. Newcastle have lost the last three derbies in succession, including 3-0 at St James' Park last season . In fact, Gus Poyet's Sunderland are unbeaten in five North East derbies and appear to have had the psychological edge over Newcastle in recent matches - something Pardew will believe his Geordie representatives can rectify. And the presence of Colback in Magpies colours as opposed to the red-and-white stripes he adorned at the Stadium of Light for six years has added yet more intrigue to an already-fascinating fixture. Colback celebrates after Sunderland beat Newcastle in October 2013 (left) and playing for the Magpies . Colback made 135 appearances for the Black Cats and played against Newcastle last season . Ex-Sunderland striker and chairman Niall Quinn has already lamented the loss of Colback, explaining that the club did not nurture the 25-year-old to then see him star for their rivals. But with so many local players in with a chance of representing Newcastle in what, for many supporters, is the biggest home match of the season, it fits in perfectly with the club's 'Black and White Derby' idea. Posters have been displayed, emails sent out to fans and messages posted on the club website advertising the initiative and encouraging supporters to wear their replica shirts, bring along their Newcastle scarves and other attire to cover St James' Park in a 'sea of black and white.' This game is huge for both sets of supporters - and for Newcastle fans, they expect nothing less than a victory.

"New Year is usually the time to make changes in your life but Queen Letizia has started early, debuting a chic new hairstyle during a charity event at the Palacio Real today. The Spanish queen, 42, showed off noticeably shorter, darker locks at the event which was held in honour of the Principe de Girona Foundation. With her was husband King Felipe, 46, who certainly seemed to approve of the new 'do and beamed broadly as he strode into the room. Scroll down for video . Royal duties: King Felipe VI of Spain and Queen Letizia met with Principe de Girona Foundation members . The foundation is the Spanish equivalent of The Prince's Trust and works with young people, helping them boost their chances of success in their careers. The foundation is named for a title once held by Felipe, the Prince of Girona, which is traditionally conferred upon Spanish royal heirs. One of the oldest given to members of the royal family, the style was introduced in 1351 by Peter IV of Aragon. Although the Kingdom of Aragon has not existed as a separate entity since 1707, the title is still given to Spanish heirs and is now held by Felipe's daughter, Infanta Leonor. New look: The former news anchor's hair appeared slightly darker in tone and was shorter . Stylish: The Queen of Spain's new haircut was glossy and flattering . Busy: Despite being so close to Christmas, Felipe and Letizia are still hard at work . Like King Felipe, Leonor's mother Queen Letizia was on good form for the event and showcased her trademark polished style, courtesy of a chic grey and black dress with a belted black coat. Felipe, meanwhile, was still sporting a rugged beard, but looked dapper in his grey pinstripe suit which he enlivened with the addition of a bright blue patterned tie. Despite the proximity to Christmas, the Spanish royals remain busy and just yesterday, unveiled the design for their first Christmas card since  taking the Spanish throne in June this year. The cover of the magenta  card features a snap of the royal couple standing on the balcony of the Zarzuela Palace in Madrid with a crowd of well-wishers below. Inside, there is a family photo, with the couple joined by their two daughters, eight-year-old Infanta Leonor and seven-year-old Infanta Sofia.

Getting it right again: The Spanish monarch has never put a foot wrong in the fashion stakes . Helping out: The Foundation helps young unemployed people get back into work .

There is also a message written in both Spanish and English, which reads: 'Merry Christmas and Happy New Year 2015. 'We hope that the excitement, the hope, and the goodwill of Christmas remain beyond these days of celebration.' Princess Leonor, who will one day be Queen of Spain,  signed the card with her official  title, Princesa de Asturias - the designation once held by her father.

He said: ‘This is a very unusual activity - most wouldn't dare to hydrospeed on a course like this, certainly not on a major glacier like this one. ‘I know some people have done it in Chamonix but we are talking about a handful of guys in the world who can do it, as it requires a lot of knowledge and expertise. ‘This is a very dangerous activity for two main reasons.First they need to check the whole glacial river to make sure there are no big crevices ahead. ‘They also need to make sure there are areas where they can stop without being swept away by the stream which can be very strong. ‘The second danger consists of glacial lakes located above, that could suddenly be released. ‘We did have that scenario and suddenly a few hundred cubic meters of half-melted ice runs down the river at full speed. ‘It was a stunning location to photograph. The place where I photographed is called Koncordia Platz, and this is where four major glaciers meet to form the Aletsch Glacier.’ The Aletsch is the largest and longest glacier in Europe in terms of area, length and depth, according to Unesco.","Claude-Alain Gailland and Gilles Janin seen carving their way through icy rivers of Aletsch Glacier, Switzerland .

"College tutor Ian Jones, 45 (pictured outside an earlier court hearing), has been warned he faces jail after being found guilty of simulating sex with two students and grabbing a teenage girl's breasts . A college tutor has been warned he faces jail after being found guilty of simulating sex with two female students and grabbing another teenage girl's breasts. Ian Jones, from Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, targeted the victims, aged between 16 and 21, while teaching a motor vehicle repair course at North Warwickshire and Hinckley College in Nuneaton, Warwickshire. The 45-year-old went on trial at Warwick Crown Court accused of 18 charges of sexual assault against five girls between 2008 and 2012. A jury took nine hours and 29 minutes to find him guilty of five of the charges by majority verdict, but cleared him of eight other charges. The jury were discharged from considering the five remaining counts which they were unable to reach verdicts on. Prosecutor Graeme Simpson said he wouldn't ask for a retrial on those matters, adding: 'The guilty verdicts fairly reflect his conduct.' During the trial, the jury heard how Jones was arrested in 2012 following an incident in which he approached a student at the college. Mr Simpson told the court: 'He walked up to her and put his hand into her coat pocket and moved his hand and touched the crotch of her jeans. 'She asked what he was doing, and he said he was looking for fags. 'Then when she bent over to pick up her bag, he put his hands on her breasts and tried to pull her backwards.' The court heard the victim, who was left crying and shaking, organised a meeting with the college's safeguarding team where she disclosed what had happened. Another female pupil then came forward and described how Jones had simulated sex with her by approaching her from behind and pushing her so she was bending over. There was also an incident when the tutor grabbed her thong as she walked past him, pulling it up with some force and commenting: 'Oh, you've got green knickers on.' Giving evidence, Jones claimed the victim was dominated by the first girl and suggested she had made a complaint to support her. The jury heard three other young women then came forward and Jones was convicted of an offence against one of them. She said Jones had made comments about her breasts and had referred to them as 'a couple of airbags'. He also pushed her over a table from behind before 'pressing his groin against her backside' and smacking her with a ruler. Mr Simpson said: 'The nature of the allegations is what one might call bullying, abusing his position of trust, but in each case it was overtly sexual.' Jones, from Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, targeted the victims, aged between 16 and 21, while teaching a motor vehicle repair course at North Warwickshire and Hinckley College (above) in Nuneaton, Warwickshire . Jones was warned he faces jail at Warwick Crown Court (above) and was bailed until sentencing next month. The judge ordered him to sign the sex offenders' register and said his 'dangerousness' should be assessed . Adjourning the case for sentencing next month, Judge Alan Parker said: 'I have got to say that the report should assess dangerousness. 'I do not have the view that Mr Jones is remotely dangerous, but it seems to me it would be wrong whenever anyone is convicted of an offence under the Sexual Offences Act not to ask for consideration of that aspect.' Jones, who was ordered to register as a sex offender, was granted bail but was warned he faces jail. Judge Parker told him: 'It must not be taken as an indication of what I'm going to do, I have an open mind.' Jones is due to be sentenced next month.","Ian Jones warned he faces jail after being convicted of five sexual assaults .

"A boy aged just eight has been banished from a Chinese village - because he was found to be HIV-positive. The youngster's own grandfather was among 200 people in the community, in China's southwestern Sichuan province, who signed a petition to expel the child to 'protect villagers' health'. It has been reported that the boy - who was given the pseudonym Kunkun by Chinese media - contracted the virus from his mother. Chinese students use handmade red ribbons to form a giant 'AIDS' collage in Hanshan, as official figures show that 497,000 people have been diagnosed with HIV/AIDS since the country's first case in 1985 . The case, reported in the Global Times newspaper, has highlighted the stigma attached to the disease in China, where many sufferers face widespread discrimination. Previous reports said the boy was refused admission to local schools and villagers would avoid contact with him. 'Nobody plays (with me), I play alone,' Kunkun said, according to a report on the website of the People's Daily newspaper. The website also said Kunkun was referred to as a 'time bomb' in the petition. 'The villagers sympathise with him, he is innocent, and only a small child. But his AIDS is too scary for us,' Wang Yishu, party chief of Shufangya village, told the website. The boy's mother reportedly left the family in 2006, while his father 'lost contact' after Kunkun's condition was diagnosed. Kunkun sneaked into a specially-convened meeting held earlier this month by villagers to discuss how they would banish him, it has been claimed. High ranking officials from the township government said 'legally speaking' the boy could not be expelled, and that he has the same rights as other villagers, the Global News said. Discrimination against AIDS sufferers remains rife across China despite numerous awareness campaigns in Shanghai and other large cities . 'Officials plan to visit the village and speak with the villagers', it added, while the People's Daily website said 'ideological work' would be carried out in the village. It was unclear last night whether Kunkun was still in his village. The case has sparked debate on China's Twitter-like Sina Weibo, where it was the most widely-discussed topic early on Thursday. 'Why was he ruthlessly neglected, it is so unfair to him,' said a post by one user. 'This is because the Chinese population cannot get enough education, causing ignorance and panic,' said another. Figures released earlier this month by China's National Health and Family Planning Commission showed that a total of 497,000 people in China have been diagnosed with HIV/AIDS since the country's first case in 1985. China has a population of 1.36billion. Discrimination against those with the virus remains an issue at schools, hospitals, workplaces and other establishments across the country, a factor that experts say hampers efforts to diagnose and treat it. Chinese students promote AIDS awareness in Liaocheng, but there is a lack of knowledge of the disease in poor, rural areas which experts say hampers efforts to diagnose and treat patients . Knowledge of HIV/AIDS is worse in poor, rural areas, such as the community Kunkun is from, experts say. Attempts by authorities to educate these populations about discrimination often fail, a campaigner who would only give his surname as Tang told AFP. 'The publicity campaign is not strong enough to reach the rural areas and villages and that's why there is more discrimination there,' said Tang, a community coordinator at the Kunming office of AIDS advocacy group Aizhixing. 'Personally I don't think such situations would exist in cities,' Tang added. 'People in rural areas know little about civil rights and they have a poor sense of the disease. 'We will continue using our network to speak out, meanwhile we hope the government could do more as well.' The Nanjing-based anti-discrimination NGO Justice for All wrote a letter to party chiefs in Sichuan calling on them to punish school chiefs and local officials for their 'Cultural Revolution style', a reference to the Mao Zedong-inspired public denunciations of 'foes'. 'We cannot imagine how Kunkun will grow up and look back on the experience of childhood,' said a draft of the letter, which was emailed to AFP on Thursday.","Child banished after 200 villagers signed petition to 'protect' the residents .

"A schoolboy is being taught in isolation after a headteacher ruled his neat and tidy hair cut was too short - by just 4.5 millimetres. Smart Anthony Mousiou, 12, takes pride in his appearance with weekly trims to maintain his traditional short-back-and-sides. But since starting school in September he has been twice internally excluded - pulled out of lessons to study alone - over the length of his hair. Since starting school in September the 12 year-old has been twice internally excluded over the length of his hair which is under the school's minimum at the back and sides, at grade 0.5, but is much longer on top . Teachers ruled the back and sides of his trim were a grade and a half too short - a mere 4.5mm. School rules state boys' hair must be no shorter than a number two and even though Anthony's hair is much longer on top, teachers complained it was only 0.5 at the sides. His furious father Evi, 44, has tried unsuccessfully to find him a new school and is now refusing to make his son grow his hair longer. Electrician Evi, from St Albans, Hertfordshire, said: 'It seems like they are picking on him - I have always felt he is being picked on. 'Their website shows pictures of boys with the hair he has been banned from having. He normally has it cut every week because he likes to be groomed and keep himself nice. They cut it short and blend it up to the top. Anthony's angry father Evi had attempted to find his son a more accepting school but was told there were no places and  Anthony was forced to return to Samuel Ryder Academy . Anthony Mousiou is being taught in isolation after a headteacher ruled his neat and tidy hair cut was too short - by just 4.5 millimetres . 'It's not an extreme hair cut - who sets these guidelines? Why do boys have to have hair long? Do they want everyone to be scruffy? 'It's really frustrating. He has already missed out - he keeps missing out.' Anthony started Samuel Ryder Academy in September, and his dad insists the St Albans school initially had no problem with his hair, which is long on top and short on the sides. But after two weeks they warned the year seven pupil his hair was too short, before making him sit lessons on his own for two days when he returned from the October half term. Angry Evi removed his son from the school for three weeks and taught him at home while he attempted to find him a different and more accepting school. But the council said there were no places in other secondary schools and frustrated Anthony returned to the academy, where he was once more put in isolation for a day. Headteacher of Samuel Ryder Academy (pictured), Matthew Gauthier, has defended his rules which state students’ hair should not be any shorter then a grade two - 6mm . After keeping his son home for a few days again, dad-of-one Evi is now attempting to negotiate with the school - but they are refusing to budge on his lad's haircut. 'He went back to school on the Monday, they put him in isolation on the Tuesday and I called the school up on Wednesday but they said he couldn't go in to lessons,' said Evi. 'He can't have a normal hair cut and I can't even get him out of the school. There is no legislation relating to pupils' uniform or appearance, which is left up to school's governing bodies to decide. But schools often impose bans on 'extreme' haircuts or colours as part of their broader uniform policy. The Department of Education does advise that pupils who don't comply to uniform rules can be disciplined in accordance with the school’s published behaviour policy. A head teacher may ask a pupil to go home briefly to remedy the breach. But if the student takes longer than is strictly necessary to effect the change, then the pupil’s parents must be notified and the absence should be recorded. If a school is considering excluding a pupil in response to breaches of uniform policy then this must be in line with the legal requirements for exclusion. 'My son has said that other kids have been out into isolation too. 'He used to have his hair how he wanted it and there was no problems - he has got good reports for behaviour and everything. It's really frustrating.' Headteacher Matthew Gauthier has defended his rules which state students’ hair should not be any shorter then a grade two - 6mm. He said: 'We have many pupils with a short back and sides but the school rules regarding haircuts state that hair must not be shorter than a grade two. 'This information is given to parents when a child starts at the school. 'At the start of the school year when he joined us, we reminded Anthony of the school rules regarding haircuts because his hair was a 0.5 grade, much shorter than the rules allowed. 'In accordance with the school rules and his previous warning, Anthony was placed in internal exclusion for one day. 'The head of year called Anthony's father to explain the situation. Mr Mousiou decided to take Anthony out of school, rather than accept the sanction. 'Mr Mousiou kept Anthony out of school against our wishes for nearly 3 weeks. 'Like every school, we have our own set of rules, standards and expectations and it is very important that these rules are consistently applied. 'This is also the first time that we have had a parent respond in this manner.'","Anthony Mousiou was told his hair broke Samuel Ryder Academy's rules .

"A Chinese man waited 20 years to get revenge on a fellow villager who had hurt his honour - by beating the man's nine-year-old daughter to death with a hammer. Yi Hsia, 40, had apparently never forgotten an insult made by his neighbour and after drinking and playing cards with friends, had grabbed the metal hammer and waited outside the man's house in Jingxi township in Minhou county in south-eastern China's Fujian province. When he spotted Yul Xu's daughter Xiao walking home with friends, he had walked up to her and  hit her over the head. Loss: Yul Xu's daughter Xiao was murdered ash she walked home with friends. The nine-year-old was murdered by Yi Hsia, who was taking revenge for an insult made 20 years earlier . Heartbreak: The girl is taken away by emergency services staff. She was dead by the time they arrived. Right, a woman, believed to be the girls' mother, cradles the body . Eyewitness Meng Liao said: 'It was sickening, he was hitting the lifeless body repeatedly on the head with a hammer. 'Loads of other people ran over including me and he ran off but by then it was too late for the girl. 'She was already dead by the time paramedics arrived. ' The nine-year-old's mother rushed to the scene but could only cradle her daughter's body in her arms and her father told police he was stunned that the other man waited 20 years to get revenge. Dad Yul, 43, said: 'I haven't had a cross word with him for 20 years, I barely remember the incident but it was certainly a stupid argument over nothing. I can't imagine why he held a grudge for so long.' The girl's uncle is overcome with grief over his niece's death. Her father told police he was stunned that the other man waited 20 years to get revenge . He added that he had seen the man walking around his house recently but had not thought anything of it. He said: 'I certainly didn't expect anything bad and definitely nothing like this. I can't believe my daughter, who was the light of our family's life and had a bright future ahead of her, has gone like that. 'I keep expecting her to walk down the street from school.' Other children who fled in terror after the hammer attack were given counselling over the incident. The family of the killer who was found hiding in an attic at his parents' home by police claimed he suffered mental problems lately. However people who been playing card with him 30 minutes before the killing said that he showed no signs of mental problems, and had only been drinking.","Yi Hsia, 40, had apparently never forgotten an insult made by his neighbour .

"The Swiss central bank plans to charge depositors a ‘negative’ interest rate of -0.25 per cent to discourage spooked investors from using it to shelter their cash. Money has flooded into Switzerland as market turbulence caused by the Russian rouble collapse and oil price slide has prompted a desperate search for safe havens in recent days. The Swiss National Bank said it would slash its interest rate on balances of over 10million Swiss francs from January 22 - effectively imposing a charge on depositors wanting to hold francs in a bid to keep its currency artificially weak against the euro. The Swiss National Bank said it would impose negative interest rates on cash held by other banks at the central bank, seeking to discourage safe-haven buying by investors anxious about the crisis in Russia . It also plans to expand its three-month target lending range from -0.75 per cent to 0.25 per cent at the same time. The franc fell after the announcement to its lowest against the euro since mid-October and to its weakest against the US dollar since May 2013. ‘Over the past few days, a number of factors have prompted increased demand for safe investments,’ the SNB said in its statement. ‘The introduction of negative interest rates makes it less attractive to hold Swiss franc investments, and thereby supports the minimum exchange rate.’ The move is also being seen as a pre-emptive strike ahead of the likely introduction of a eurozone quantitative easing programme next year. The SNB’s minimum exchange rate is a cap of 1.20 per euro for the franc, which it set at the height of the eurozone crisis in 2011 and which it stressed was still its key policy tool. The franc, the most liquid safe-haven currency after the Japanese yen, has stuck close to the 1.20 limit in recent days as fears of a full-blown financial crisis in Russia and economic weakness globally prompted investors to seek safety.

"A safety inspector was killed after he walked through a factory door and plunged 13 feet onto a gravy-making machine. Nigel Chester, 46, suffered serious head injuries after tumbling head first into the void at Premier Foods in Worksop, Nottinghamshire which makes gravy granules and OXO cubes. But his death was ruled an accident by a jury at Nottingham Council House on Tuesday, after a two-day inquest. Nigel Chester, 46, of Arnold, Nottingham, suffered serious head injuries after tumbling head first into the void at Premier Foods in Worksop, Nottinghamshire (pictured) which makes gravy granules and OXO cubes . Mr Chester, who worked for the Thurmaston branch of ADT Fire and Security, lived with his wife Kathleen and stepdaughters Abbie and Rebecca Brooks in a £210,000 house in Arnold, Nottingham. An inquest heard that Mr Chester had been checking smoke detectors at the factory when he used a master key to unlock a first-floor door. The door was installed 10 years ago when bosses thought a gantry needed to be built above a piece of machinery. But managers at the food factory decided the gantry was not necessary and the door 'to nowhere' was left locked. A technician revealed that he recently installed a 'danger' sign warning about the drop near the locked door. It read 'Danger. Keep this door locked. Four metre fall to the floor if opened.' However, Mr Chester had just checked a smoke detector sensor when he accidentally fell 13 feet on May 1 last year. Mr Chester's death was ruled an accident yesterday by a jury at Nottingham Council House (pictured) Andrew McNamara, assistant coroner for Nottingham, said: 'A large piece of equipment required a gantry to be in position above the machinery. 'A door was installed for access from the first floor but it was then decided the gantry wasn't necessary. 'Shortly before the incident, Mr Chester checked a sensor on the first floor. He then unlocked the door and stepped into the void.' Melvin Lacey, a technician at the factory, said he had given a master key to Mr Chester so he could access a lift room and store cupboards to check the smoke sensors. He told the hearing the door had been there for about 10 years but had never been opened to his knowledge. Mr Lacey added: 'About a month before, we had new printing equipment, so I printed out a bigger version of the sign that was on the door. 'It said 'Danger. Keep this door locked. Four metre fall to the floor if opened'.' Glyn Howarth, a power plant technologist who has worked at Premier Foods for 23 years, told the inquest he rushed to Mr Chester's aid after the fall. He said: 'I heard a bang but it was an alien sound. I didn't recognise it, so I went to investigate and observed someone on the floor. 'I then became aware he had a visitor's name badge around his neck. I called the manager and told him in no uncertain terms that there had been a very serious accident.' Mr Chester died after falling 13 feet and hitting his head on a machine which makes OXO gravy . Two other witnesses told the inquest Mr Chester was found bleeding from his head. Odette Birks, a senior product development technologist, who has been trained in first aid for 24 years, said: 'It was horrific. 'He had serious injuries to his head. When I was told, I ran to security to get the defibrillator because I could tell it was serious. 'I checked his pulse and it was quite strong, and he was breathing, but he didn't say anything to us.' McNamara, added: 'Nigel Chester died at Bassetlaw District General Hospital on May 1, 2013 as a consequence of head injuries following a fall. 'It's fairly obvious what happened, for whatever reason, and we'll never know the reason, he used the key to open the first floor door and fell to his death. 'It looks as though he struck a pipe and then fell to the floor and sustained what turned out to be fatal injuries.' A post mortem report, carried out by Professor Guy Rutty, said Mr Chester suffered a number of fractures to his skull. It added: 'There was no evidence of drugs or alcohol in his system at the time of his death.' Simon Antrobus, who represented Premier Foods, said the door had been left there without a gantry for 10 years in case one was needed in the future. He told the inquest: 'It was left there to enable flexibility. If the machine had been replaced or moved, the door may have been needed. 'That is my understanding as to why the door is still there.' Premier Foods group manufactures a wide range of foods for companies such as OXO, Ambrosia and Mr Kipling. The Oxo brand was sold by Unilever to the Campbell Soup company in 2001. Campbell's UK operation was sold to Premier Foods in 2006. An ADT Fire and Security spokesman said: ‘Nigel was a much loved and valued member of our East Midlands branch and is sorely missed by his colleagues and friends. ‘We hope the conclusion of the inquest will bring some closure for Nigel’s family and loved ones first and foremost.’ A Premier Foods spokesman said: 'Premier Foods offers its sincere condolences to the family, friends and colleagues of Mr Chester who died as a result of a tragic accident at our Worksop site on May 1 2013. 'As a company, we take our responsibilities for the health and safety of our employees, and others who work on our premises, very seriously and we have had an exemplary record over the years. 'The accident to Mr Chester is currently under investigation by the Health and Safety Executive and we will continue to co-operate fully with them in support of their investigation. 'Due to this ongoing investigation, we are unable to comment further at this time.' The Health and Safety Executive confirmed it was alerted to the incident at the time, . A spokesman said: 'An investigation was launched in May 2013 and that Investigation is on-going. 'A decision on the next steps will be taken in due course.'","Nigel Chester, 46, suffered serious head injuries after falling on a machine .

"A Massachusetts Uber driver is accused of sexually assaulting a woman who had summoned the ride-sharing service. Authorities say 46-year-old Alejandro Done was arraigned on Wednesday in Cambridge District Court. The Boston man pleaded not guilty to charges including rape and kidnapping. Investigators say Done picked up the woman in Boston on December 6. She had summoned an Uber driver to take her to her Cambridge home. The pick-up spot: 46-year-old Alejandro Done allegedly picked up a woman from Tremont Street (pictured) then allegedly drove her to a secluded area where he sexually assaulted her . Uber customers use a smartphone application to arrange and pay for rides with nearby drivers. The driver allegedly told the woman that he would need a cash payment, so he took her to an ATM. Authorities say he then drove her to a secluded location and sexually assaulted her. The Wicked Local reports that Done drove to a location that she was not familiar with then her pulled over in a secluded area and jumped in the backseat where she was sitting. He allegedly hit her and strangled her and locked the car doors so that she could not escape and covered her mouth so she could not scream. He then allegedly sexually assaulted the woman. Uber says it's working closely with law enforcement to assist in the investigation. 'This alleged predator took advantage of a young woman who trusted that he was who he portrayed himself to be and exploited her vulnerability once he had her in his car,' said District Attorney Marian Ryan. 'Every day people are engaging car services for their transportation needs, and placing their trust in them for their personal safety and security. While these services are a convenience, and often a necessity of modern urban living, we urge everyone to take precautions to ensure they are as safe as possible,' said Ryan. In hauntingly similar case's, three different women told Boston police that they were sexually assaulted over the weekend after getting into to cars they believed they ordered via ride sharing apps such as Uber and Lyft. At least two of three women who police said were indecently assaulted Sunday while using ride-sharing services in Boston had ordered vehicles through Uber, according to authorities. Police said on Monday night that all three incidents occurred early Sunday morning between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m. in Dorchester, the Allston-Brighton area, and an unspecified location between Faneuil Hall and Dorchester. First incident: The first incident occurred just before 1 a.m. on Sunday when a woman was picked up at Dorchester Avenue and Columbia Road and a driver allegedly proceeded to touch her inappropriately . The Boston Globe reports that the first incident occurred just before 1 a.m. on Sunday when a woman was picked up at Dorchester Avenue and Columbia Road and a driver allegedly proceeded to touch her inappropriately. She says she later got a text from her ride-share service saying her actual driver had arrived. She ordered the car to stop and she ran out but police were not able to find the car she described being assaulted in. At around 2:30 a.m. a second incident occurred when a woman called for a car to pick her up at 1030 commonwealth Avenue and take her home. She got into a vehicle and was 'assaulted by an individual she believed to be employed by a rideshare service,' police said. She was able to resist the driver's advances and get out of the car.

Taylor Bennett, a spokesperson for the ride-sharing service Uber, sent a statement to CBS saying, 'no one should hail or get into any vehicle on the street that is not a clearly identifiable pre-arranged transportation provider or licensed taxi. There are strong reasons why doing so is unsafe, and therefore illegal, in the city of Boston.' Meghan Joyce, who works as the general manager for Uber Boston, said the service has measures in place to guard against such incidents. 'Our technology has brought an unprecedented degree of accountability and transparency to the transportation industry — with driver and vehicle information provided in-app, detailed email receipts sent after each ride, a 24/7 feedback loop, and the ability to share your journey in real time,' the statement said.
