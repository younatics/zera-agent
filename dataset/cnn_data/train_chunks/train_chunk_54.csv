"(CNN) -- The Gulf of Mexico undersea gusher is the largest oil spill in United States history -- possibly already more than twice as big as the Exxon Valdez spill, government estimates suggested Thursday. Scientists observed 130,000 to 270,000 barrels of oil on the water's surface on May 17, and think a similar amount had already been burned, skimmed, dispersed or evaporated. That would mean 260,000 to 540,000 barrels had leaked as of 10 days ago. The Exxon Valdez leaked about 250,000 barrels into Alaska's Prince William Sound in 1989. The busted well is spewing oil at a rate of at least 12,000 to 19,000 barrels a day, U.S. Geological Survey chief Marcia McNutt told reporters Thursday. A barrel of oil has 42 gallons, so that's 504,000 to 798,000 gallons a day. That's more than twice as much as previous estimates, which put the rate at 5,000 barrels, or 210,000 gallons, per day. It's also the more conservative estimate of two reached by two separate teams of government scientists who used two different methods, McNutt told reporters Thursday. One team looked at the oil on the surface and came up with the estimate of 12,000 to 19,000 barrels per day. A second team used a different method and came up with a range of 12,000 to 25,000 barrels per day, McNutt said. The official estimate uses the range where the estimates overlap. The lower end of the government estimate -- 12,000 barrels per day -- would mean that about 18.6 million gallons of oil has been spilled since the April 20 oil rig explosion that started the leak. The higher end -- 19,000 barrels per day -- would mean 29.5 million gallons has been spilled. The Exxon Valdez spilled about 11 million gallons of oil. Worldwide, there have been more than a dozen bigger oil spills than the Gulf spill. The worst was the destruction of Kuwaiti terminals and tankers by Saddam Hussein's forces during the 1991 Gulf war, which spilled 240 million gallons, according to the Oil Spill Intelligence Report. The amount of oil spilled could have very specific financial ramifications for BP. If the government finds the company negligent or the leak avoidable, BP will owe royalties on the lost oil, Minerals Management Service spokesman Nicholas Pardi told CNN. ""Now we know the true scale of the monster we are fighting in the Gulf,"" said Jeremy Symons, senior vice president of the National Wildlife Federation. ""BP has unleashed an unstoppable force of appalling proportions. It's as if two Exxon Valdez tankers have already run aground, and more are on the way if they don't get this hole plugged. ""This independent government estimate shows what we expected all along -- BP cannot be trusted, because every gallon of oil that is spilled means they will pay more in fines and liability,"" Symons said. The estimates are preliminary and based on new methodologies, McNutt said in a teleconference. The first team, which got the lower estimate, analyzed how much oil was on the surface of the Gulf of Mexico on a given date, using aerial imaging. They estimated that ""130,000 to 270,000 barrels (were) on the surface of the Gulf of Mexico on May 17,"" McNutt said. ""We estimate that, in addition, as of May 17 a similar volume of oil had already been burned, skimmed, dispersed or evaporated,"" she said. That led those scientists to the range of 12,000 to 19,000 barrels per day. The second group used video observations to arrive at the higher figure. The scientific teams were composed of federal scientists, independent experts and representatives from universities around the country, McNutt said. BP, which owns the well, was not involved except to provide raw data, she said. CNN's Richard Allen Greene, David Mattingly and Courtney Yager, and CNN Radio's Lisa Desjardins contributed to this report.","Gulf spill significantly larger than Exxon Valdez accident of 1989, estimates indicate .

"Venice, Louisiana (CNN) -- Seven oil spill recovery workers who were hospitalized in New Orleans after complaining of feeling ill were properly trained and had protective gear on, according to the the federal on-scene coordinator for the oil spill response effort in the Gulf of Mexico. ""The heat and humidity in Louisiana can be challenging,"" Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry told reporters Thursday afternoon. She said the workers were treated for several symptoms, including headaches, nausea, vomiting and shortness of breath. Safety officials from the Coast Guard, BP and the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration had responded to the incident, Landry. ""Basically, these folks all had the proper personal protective equipment on, and they all received the required training,"" she said. ""Fortunately, everyone is fine."" An investigation is under way ""to make sure what we can do to ensure that these workers are all working in safe conditions,"" Landry said. ""We will continue to monitor this situation very carefully so that nobody is put in harm's way as they respond to this spill,"" she added. A BP spokesman, John Curry, said the company takes ""worker safety seriously."" The company also said it has provided spill recovery workers with protective equipment, such as suits, steel-toed boots, gloves, hard hats and safety glasses. In addition, BP said, workers are conducting about 250 air-quality tests a day. They also are testing workers for exposure to irritants and other substances that could be harmful, BP said. The company also noted that testing has shown that ""airborne contaminants are well within safe limits."" The seven workers were at West Jefferson Medical Center in suburban New Orleans, said spokeswoman Taslin Alfonzo said. Five were discharged Thursday afternoon, she said. Based on their symptoms, the workers appeared to have come into contact with some type of irritant, Alfonzo said. However, the hospital doesn't have a toxicology department, so it couldn't identify the irritant. About 10 workers complained of feeling ill on Wednesday, prompting officials to recall more than 100 boats from an area adjacent to the Mississippi River delta. Lisa Faust with the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals said she believes as many as five were treated at the scene. Six of the seven were brought to the Marrero, Louisiana, hospital Wednesday night by ambulance, and the seventh was flown in. No additional patients have been admitted, Alfonzo said. The Unified Command -- a coalition of agencies including the U.S. Coast Guard, the Department of the Interior and the National Parks Service -- said Wednesday it recalled 125 vessels from Breton Sound, which lies about 50 miles southeast of New Orleans. The vessels were involved in cleaning up oil that has been gushing into the Gulf of Mexico since April, when an oil rig sank about 40 miles south of Louisiana, opening up a leak that has been gushing crude oil into the water. U.S. Rep. Charlie Melancon, D-Louisiana, again called on the federal government to deploy temporary clinics to south Louisiana to screen workers and relatives possibly affected by the oil. ""As I first alerted the federal government over a week ago, our workers and residents in the oil-affected areas of south Louisiana are facing a looming health crisis,"" Melancon said in a written statement. ""People are being exposed to hazardous oil fumes and potentially dangerous dispersants every day, and there is no health care infrastructure in place to treat them and monitor the situation."" Melancon said he will personally ask President Barack Obama to take action when Obama visits south Louisiana on Friday.","NEW: BP says it takes worker safety seriously .

"(CNN) -- Conservative videographer James O'Keefe and three co-defendants pleaded guilty Wednesday to entering federal property under false pretenses for a January incident in which they tried to tamper with the phone system in the New Orleans office of Sen. Mary Landrieu. O'Keefe, 25, and co-defendants Joseph Basel, 24, Robert Flanagan, 24, and Stan Dai, 25, were each fined $1,500, placed on probation and ordered to do community service, according to a Department of Justice statement. The four were arrested in January after Basel and Flanagan posed as telephone repair workers to get into Landrieu's office. O'Keefe also was in the office and secretly videotaped the incident, while Dai was outside, according to the Justice Department statement. Landrieu, a Democrat, had voted in favor of the Democratic health care reform bill the previous month. Calling himself an ""investigative journalist,"" O'Keefe claimed he was trying to test the credibility of a claim by Landrieu that her office had been unable to field calls from constituents opposed to her stance on the Senate health care bill because her phone lines had been ""jammed for weeks."" Basel and Flanagan told a staffer in Landrieu's office that they were telephone repairmen and were granted access to the reception desk's phone system. All four were arrested shortly after leaving the office. O'Keefe is the same conservative activist who dressed as a pimp last summer and visited the offices of ACORN, which bills itself as an advocacy group for low- and middle-income families, to solicit advice on setting up a brothel, among other scenarios, law enforcement officials confirmed. He secretly recorded the visits on videotapes that were posted on the Internet, leading to a media firestorm. ACORN announced in March it was shutting down due to a loss of funding.","O'Keefe, three others plead guilty to illegally entering senator's office .

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- Don't be surprised if, any day now, you read that the People's Republic of Arizona is in the market for nuclear warheads to put an end, once and for all, to illegal immigration on its southern border. After all, it's the next logical step for the rogue state. This week, to advance the narrative that Arizona has no choice but to do its own immigration enforcement because the federal government is asleep at the switch, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer called for air support. Brewer requested helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles from the White House to patrol the border region with Mexico. In a letter to President Obama, Brewer asked that the National Guard reallocate reconnaissance helicopters and robotic surveillance craft to the ""border states"" to prevent illegal immigration. The governor also requested the deployment of unmanned drones, including possibly the Predator drones used in Iraq and Afghanistan. In fact, in her letter, Brewer even mentioned those foreign wars as examples of where the drones have been effective. What's the matter with Arizona? Isn't it a little early in the year for the folks in the desert to be suffering from sunstroke? I guess this is par for the course. Brewer just signed SB 1070, a disgraceful anti-immigration and pro-racial-profiling law, to give local and state cops throughout the state the chance to suit up and play border patrol agent. Why shouldn't she get the chance to suit up and play general? After all, like the United States, Arizona is currently involved in two wars. There's the hypocritical war against the very illegal immigrants that the state has spent the past 15 years providing with gainful employment by allowing them to do jobs that Arizonans wouldn't do. And then there's the rhetorical war with the Obama administration, which Arizona wants to portray as negligent in stopping illegal immigration, which forced Arizonans to take matters into their own hands. The argument that the federal government isn't actively engaged in border enforcement is both dishonest and reckless. It is dishonest because it's not true. I've visited the U.S.-Mexico border a dozen times in the past 10 years: in Texas, Arizona and California. I've interviewed countless border patrol agents and supervisors. I've also been up in a Border Patrol helicopter flying above the border, which offers a unique perspective on border security. So I can tell you what the border patrol agents on the ground would tell you: The U.S.-Mexico border has never been more fortified. There are now more than 20,000 border patrol agents on the federal payroll. That's more agents than any other federal enforcement agency, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Those agents apprehend people and deport them at a feverish clip. In fact, it was recently announced that the Obama administration deported more people last year than the Bush administration during its final year in office. It is reckless because -- when this law is hauled before a federal judge, as it will be -- opponents will argue that the measure violates the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution by usurping federal authority to enforce immigration law. And that's the very thing that proponents seem to be admitting in their bravado. In fact, it might not be a bad idea for Arizona officials to pipe down and stop bragging about how they're doing the job of the federal government in terms of immigration enforcement, since that's a no-no under the Constitution. If the federal government does take border enforcement seriously, critics might ask: Why are there still people trying to enter the United States illegally? Simple. We can dig a moat, deploy an army, build walls or call in an airstrike, but desperate people will always find a way to go around, under or over any impediment in their path to a better life. This isn't to condone illegal immigration. My views -- in support of deportations, workplace raids, giving more resources to the Border Patrol etc. -- are well known. I'm just telling you what Border Patrol agents tell me: that it doesn't make any sense to focus all our attention at the border while turning a blind eye to employers in the interior. That's like trying to fill a bucket with teaspoons of water without first plugging the hole at the bottom. Now Obama has fallen into that same trap. He is reportedly ready to announce that he is sending 1,200 National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border to help control illegal immigration and quell some of the violence. That's a far cry from the 6,000 troops that Arizona Sen. John McCain had requested, and congressional Republicans seem miffed that Obama stole their thunder. Still, as long as the troops follow the protocol laid out in 2006 when George W. Bush launched Operation Jumpstart -- that they're unarmed and act only in a support capacity to the Border Patrol by fixing vehicles, monitoring surveillance equipment, repairing fences -- I think sending the National Guard is a fine idea. It's just not the magic bullet that the most enthusiastic proponents of the idea would have us believe. There's only one of those. It involves fining, arresting and prosecuting the employers of illegal immigrants, including people who are, this election year, streaming into fundraisers for McCain, Brewer and other tough-talking Republicans vowing to solve a problem that many of their backers helped create. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr.","Arizona has asked for military equipment, including drones, to beef up border security .

"(CNN) -- A flat-faced frogfish, bug-eating slug and carnivorous sea sponge are some of the top new species named by scientists. They appear on a ""top 10"" list of new species released Saturday amid warnings from the United Nations that the world is not doing enough to protect vulnerable eco-systems. ""Biodiversity loss is moving ecological systems ever closer to tipping point beyond which they will no longer be able to fulfill their vital functions,"" said Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on the International Day for Biological Diversity,  which is being marked in 11 countries. More coverage: Environment . A report released in late April by researchers from the United Nations Environment Program showed that world leaders had failed on a 2002 commitment to reduce the global rate of biodiversity loss by 2010. It found that since 1970 animal populations had dropped 30 percent, the area covered by mangroves and sea grasses was down 20 percent and the coverage of living corals had fallen 40 percent. ""The deadline has arrived, yet the deterioration of our natural resources continues apace,"" the secretary-general said in a statement. He warned that communities everywhere would ""reap the negative consequences,"" but that the ""poorest people and most vulnerable communities will suffer most."" A number of events were held around the world Saturday to mark the International Day of Biodiversity. A garden was created along Paris' Champs-Elysees, children in Brazil were encouraged to dress up as animals, and the European Environment Agency unveiled a ""living wall"" at its headquarters in Copenhagen, Denmark. The release of a top 10 list species for 2009 continues an annual tradition that marks the anniversary of the birth of Carolus Linnaeus, who initiated the modern system of classifying plants and animals. The new list, issued by the International Institute for Species Exploration at Arizona State University,  was chosen from 18,225 species new to science in 2008, the most recent year for which data has been compiled. They come from Africa, Indonesia, Madagascar, Myanmar, New Zealand, the Philippines, Thailand, the U.S. and Uruguay. The new discoveries include a golden orb spider able to spin webs of more than a meter in diameter. It is the first of its species named since 1879. A minnow with fangs found in Myanmar is the first example of oral teeth-like structure found in the largest family of freshwater fishes. And, the sea slug that eats bugs was an unusual find in Pak Phanang Bay in the Gulf of Thailand as nearly all sacoglossans, or sea slugs, eat algae. ""Most people do not realize just how incomplete our knowledge of Earth's species is or the steady rate at which taxonomists are exploring that diversity,"" said Quentin Wheeler, director of the International Institute of Species Exploration.","Top 10 new species list includes frogfish, golden orb spider, bug-eating slugs .

"Washington (CNN) -- Homegrown terrorism will be part of the United States' National Security Strategy for the first time, according to President Barack Obama's chief counterterrorism adviser, who called it a new phase of the terrorist threat. When the Obama administration unveils its National Security Strategy on Thursday, it will be the first time any president ""explicitly recognizes the threat to the United States posed by individuals radicalized here at home,"" National Security Adviser John Brennan said Wednesday. The strategy acts as a blueprint for how a White House administration intends to protect Americans. In the past, it has focused mostly on international threats. But a spate of terror-related plots in the United States recently prompted the Obama administration to include homegrown terrorism in the document, Brennan said. Earlier this month, Pakistani-American Faisal Shahzad was charged with trying to detonate a car bomb in New York's bustling district of Times Square. U.S. Army Major Nidal Malik Hasan is suspected of fatally shooting 13 people at Fort Hood in November. Colorado resident Najibullah Zazi, an Afghan national, pleaded guilty in February for conspiring to detonate explosives in the New York subway system. And David Headley, an American citizen from Chicago, Illinois, is accused of providing surveillance in the Mumbai, India, terrorist attacks that killed 160 people. ""We've seen an increasing number of individuals here in the United States become captivated by extremist ideology or causes,"" Brennan said. ""We have seen individuals, including U.S. citizens armed with their U.S. passports, travel easily to extremist safe havens, return to America, their deadly plans disrupted by coordinated intelligence and law enforcement."" Brennan, who made his comments at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said that as the United States has strengthened its defenses against massive attacks like 9/11, al Qaeda has shown itself to be a ""resilient, resourceful and determined enemy."" Brennan said al Qaeda is recruiting individuals with little training, attempting relatively unsophisticated attacks and seeking people living in the United States to launch such attacks. ""They are seeking foot soldiers who might slip through our defense,"" Brennan said.  ""As our enemy adapts and evolves their tactics, so must we constantly adapt and evolve ours."" Brennan did not provide any specific details about the president's strategy for combating al Qaeda and its affiliates, but said it ""will require a broad, sustained and integrated campaign that harnesses every tool of American power, military and civilian, kinetic and diplomatic.""","National Security Strategy acts as blueprint for how White House plans to protect Americans .

"Editor's note: Jim Rogers is chief executive officer of Charlotte, North Carolina-based Duke Energy, which generates much of its power from coal-burning plants and is making investments in clean energy technology in China. Jonathan Lash is the president of the World Resources Institute. Ming Sung is Asia Pacific representative of the Clean Air Task Force. Jim Rogers, CEO of coal-burning Duke Energy, wants the U.S. to join with China against greenhouse gases. (CNN) -- There is a lot of rhetoric on Main Street and in our nation's Capitol these days portraying China as a job-stealing polluter whose economy is growing at the expense of the United States. But business leaders and policy advocates who work in China see a different picture: a China that is investing heavily in innovation and determined to win the global race to supply its citizens and the world with clean energy technologies. China is the largest producer of solar water heaters, with 50 percent of the world's production and 65 percent of all installations. It produces 30 percent of the world's photovoltaic sets and is installing wind turbines faster than any other nation. China's expanding middle class is increasingly mobile, with more than 50 million electric bicycles, and China is developing the first mass-produced plug-in hybrid electric car. The country has 14 nuclear power plants under construction and plans to start 10 more next year. Although there has been much talk about creating ""green jobs"" in the United States, China leads the world with its massive investment in energy efficiency and renewable power. China's growth has come with a heavy price: pollution. China produces 80 percent of its electricity from coal and now leads the world in greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants. Dirty air and contaminated water affect many millions of Chinese and are two of the nation's most serious problems. Although the United States has made great strides in reducing pollution in recent decades, we are still the world's second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, with emissions per capita four times higher than China's. Our nation is also heavily dependent on coal and imported oil. We are moving ahead in solar energy, wind and efficiency, but we are doing so in a fragmented, state-by-state approach that reflects our democracy and regulatory structures. By forging relationships with leading Chinese state-owned and private energy and technology companies, U.S. companies -- at times working with the federal government -- can create a ""ladder of cooperation"" with the Chinese to lead the world forward on climate change. We will not climb this ladder overnight but one rung at a time. With the United Nations' climate change conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, just two months away, it is imperative that our two nations establish a more trusting, give-and-take relationship upon which good business partnerships are built. The World Resources Institute, the Clean Air Task Force and Duke Energy have started this work, with great prospects for results. WRI, an independent, non-partisan environmental research organization, is working with China to calculate its greenhouse emissions as a key part of its next national Five-Year Plan to advance its economy. The intent is to develop reportable and verifiable measures in the plan that could facilitate China's participation in an international climate agreement. Duke Energy recently announced a memorandum of understanding with the China Huaneng Group, China's largest power generator, and the ENN Group, one of the nation's largest private energy companies. The focus of these efforts is to cooperatively develop and commercialize an array of clean energy technologies. The Clean Air Task Force -- an environmental organization advancing clean technology in the United States and China -- is pivotal to Duke Energy efforts. It has created a network of a dozen Chinese and U.S. companies to develop joint business ventures to build advanced, low-carbon coal technology in China and around the world. This network is expanding to include an array of other renewable and clean energy technologies. Historically, Americans have known little about China and, at times, are justifiably concerned about its growing power and influence. This is changing as our trading and financial interdependencies grow. Today, China is the largest exporter to the United States and the largest holder of U.S. debt. It is clearly not beneficial to either country to turn back the clock. There always will be healthy competition between China and the United States in developing and marketing technologies, but we must work closely together to scale up and commercialize the best ideas, regardless of whether it comes from our two nations or other countries in Europe or Asia or North America. China and the United States bring extraordinary and complementary skills to the table. China's 1.3 billion people and unmatched economies of scale can bring new technologies to market fast -- in ""China time"" -- at a speed that is virtually impossible anywhere else in the world. The United States is the world's largest economy, with an educational and technological infrastructure that is unmatched in the world, and stable energy regulation and investment policies. The sooner we get to work on achieving proposed congressional targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050, the less expensive addressing climate change will ultimately be. We need to build on the emerging cooperation that exists between our two nations on energy and climate. We need to take responsibility for the fact that we are the world's two largest emitters of greenhouse gases. If the United States and China can come together to lead on addressing climate change, the rest of world will follow. To make this relationship work, each country should leave fear and timidity at the door, put economic self-interest to work and forge the strategic partnerships necessary to get the job done. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jim Rogers, Jonathan Lash and Ming Sung.","Authors urge 80 percent less greenhouse gas by 2050 .

"(The Frisky) -- Last night Nicole Scherzinger was the 10th star to claim the mirrored ball on ""Dancing with the Stars."" The lead Pussycat Doll went up against Olympic figure skater Evan Lysacek and ESPN anchor Erin Andrews and came out victorious. Many predicted that Scherzinger would win from the start based on her spectacular performances and stage presence, not to mention her extensive dance history as a member of the Pussycat Dolls. But Lysacek and Andrews gave her a good run for her money, bringing an enjoyable end to a season of controversy. Was it me, or was season 10 the most exciting ever? Kate Gosselin's diva behavior, Jake Pavelka's cornball glances at Vienna Girardi, and Nicole's spats with Pamela Anderson made it must-watch TV, not to mention Elisabeth Hasselbeck's major snafu regarding Erin Andrews' wardrobe. The show seriously picked the right contestants this time around. To help them out for season 11, here are the 15 stars we'd love to see do the rumba next. The Frisky: Kate Gosselin and 7 more celebs rejected by Playboy . Katie Holmes . So she might be a bit out of reach, especially since Katie Holmes is stuck in the Tom Cruise isolation bubble, but this could be a rebirth for her. Let's face it: Holmes has a lost some of her flair and she lets her daughter do most of the fancy dressing. ""Dancing with the Stars"" would allow Holmes to separate herself from TomKat, and at least get her out of the house. Heidi Klum and Seal . The couple has said in interviews that they are interested in joining ""Dancing with the Stars."" It would be good for everyone. Heidi Klum could get away from judging those sassy ""Project Runway"" stylists and rock some tacky, sparkly clothes. Seal could get back on the radar for something other than being Klum's husband. And the show could get to play off the drama of having a competing couple. The Frisky: 10 top models without makeup . Oprah Winfrey . Oprah may be leaving her iconic television show behind, but that doesn't mean she can't move on to something else. She needs to think of all the fans she has been shepherding for so many years! Honestly, with the number of women who look to her for advice on what to eat, read, and wear -- I don't think there's any way she could lose. Josh ""Sawyer"" Holloway . Now that ""Lost"" is over, people are going to have to find their dose of shirtless Sawyer somewhere else. We can sit around and watch old ""Lost"" clips, but I think seeing him get sweaty and strip down in a samba would be a better alternative. Yes? The Frisky: 8 things I won't miss now that ""Lost"" is off the TV map . Celine Dion . Back in 2007, the Canadian songstress said that she was interested in doing the show. Why hasn't ""DWTS"" snatched her up yet? They have a pretty loose definition of ""star,"" and she would be one of their biggest grabs. I am picturing a ""Titanic""-themed waltz to ""My Heart Would Go On."" It would be cheesily epic. Betty White . This lady is 2010's big thing, and rightfully so. Betty White is adorable, feisty, and totally held her own on ""Saturday Night Live"" this month. If White ends up in a set of dancing shoes, I am officially dubbing her the coolest grandma ever. The Frisky: 10 summer dresses under $50 . Johnny Weir . So Evan Lysacek gave it his shot and got to the final three, but I think Johnny Weir could take it all the way. Throughout the Olympics, he was known for bringing theatricality and flair to all his performances. The dance floor is the only other place that I can think of that could capture Weir's signature brand of pizzazz. Plus, we'd get the added perks of more self-designed outfits and seeing him get to beat Lysacek at something. Sarah Silverman . The comedian just had her show on Comedy Central canceled, so now it is time to dance the pain away. Sarah Silverman strikes us as sort of klutzy, but I am sure that can be smoothed out by the tender footsteps of Tony or Derek. Silverman is sure to make the sometimes exhaustive judging process a little more entertaining. Bob Saget . Between ""Full House"" and ""America's Funniest Home Videos,"" Bob Saget seems like quite the family man. But I have heard rumors that in real life he has a dirty sense of humor. Maybe Saget could reroute that crudeness into sexy dance moves? It would be a good mix of amusing and awkward, since a lot of viewers probably couldn't see past Saget as anyone other than Daddy Tanner. Dr. Drew . It is time for Dr. Drew to add something else to his resume other than harassing addicted celebrities and pregnant teens. The Doc needs to come to the dance floor and switch from psychoanalysis to polka. The Frisky: See 10 stars who've worn ankle alcohol monitors [SCRAMs] . Ryan Seacrest . ""American Idol"" is finally starting to see a decline, while ""Dancing with the Stars"" just had one of its most successful seasons. Now I haven't taken math since high school but it seems like it is time for Seacrest to think about switching teams. A little bit of fancy footwork could be just what he needs, though they would have to make it clear he couldn't host the show. Sarah Ferguson . The Duchess herself has said she wants to be on the show because her kids love to watch her dance. Now that she is stuck in the middle of a bribery controversy, she could use ""DTWS"" for image revitalization. Though there is a chance not even ""Dancing with the Stars"" could save her from this royal mess. Kendra Wilkinson . Speaking of image revitalization, Kendra Wilkinson could use a little help right now. Her sex tape has just hit the market, and with a rumored second one on the way, Kendra needs to get people's minds off these tapes and onto something else. And she already proved on her former reality show ""The Girls Next Door"" that she definitely can ""shake her booty."" The Frisky: Pro tennis player's breast reduction deflates her fan base . Mr. T . Mr. T had a brief fling as a rapper, and now it is time for him to reach triple threat territory. I pity the fool who don't vote for him. With the movie remake of ""A-Team"" out soon, he needs to make sure viewers know who the real B.A. Baracus is.

"Washington (CNN) -- Minerals Management Service Director Elizabeth Birnbaum has been fired, according to two CNN sources. A senior administration official has told CNN that an official announcement will be made during President Barack Obama's news conference scheduled for Thursday afternoon. The decision to fire Birnbaum comes in the wake of a recently released report highlighting what many observers have characterized as widespread corruption at the Minerals Management Service (MMS), which is part of the Interior Department. The period covered by the report was prior to the April explosion in the Gulf of Mexico that sank the oil rig Deepwater Horizon, resulting in a massive oil spill that well owner BP and federal authorities are still trying to cap. Among other things, the report, issued by the Interior Department's inspector general, revealed that federal inspectors overseeing oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico accepted meals and tickets to sporting events from companies they monitored. In one case, an inspector in the MMS office in Lake Charles, Louisiana, conducted inspections of four offshore platforms while negotiating a job with the company, the report stated. The Lake Charles investigation was launched shortly after another scandal emerged from within the MMS. A September 2008 inspector general's report found regulators in the agency's Colorado office received improper gifts from energy industry representatives and engaged in illegal drug use and inappropriate sexual relations with them. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar recently called the allegations of MMS corruption ""evidence of the cozy relationship between some elements of [the agency] and the oil and gas industry.""  He pledged to follow through with the Interior Department inspector general's recommendations, ""including taking any and all appropriate personnel actions including termination, discipline and referrals of any wrongdoing for criminal prosecution."" Salazar insisted Thursday in testimony before a House subcommittee, however, that Birnbaum had resigned ""on her own terms and own volition."" She ""is a strong and very effective person who, among other things, helped us break through the very difficult things which we have a lot more work to do,"" Salazar said. ""She helped us with addressing a very broken system. And all I can really [say] is that she is a good public servant."" MMS collected nearly $10 billion in royalties from the energy and mining industries in 2009. Salazar recently announced that he was splitting up the agency to separate its energy development, enforcement and revenue collection divisions, saying they have ""conflicting missions"" that needed to be separated. The associate director for the agency's Offshore Minerals Management Program is leaving at the end of May, a month earlier than planned, in the wake of the Gulf spill. That official, Chris Oynes, launched the investigation that resulted in former New Orleans, Louisiana, supervisor Donald Howard's firing in 2007. Howard later pleaded guilty after being accused of failing to report gifts valued  at more than $6,600 from an offshore drilling contractor. As part of the growing push to crack down on the MMS, Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida, introduced legislation Wednesday requiring federal oil industry regulators to wait at least two years after leaving government service before going to work for companies they helped regulate. Among other things, the bill would bar regulators from accepting gifts from oil companies. It also would require regulators to divest themselves of any stock they may currently hold in oil companies, and prohibit regulators from part-time employment in the industry.","MMS Service Director Elizabeth Birnbaum has been fired, sources say .

"(CNN) -- Memorial Day is a day set aside to remember the U.S. troops who have died. One way to honor the fallen troops is to volunteer at a veterans cemetery. And while there are opportunities on Memorial Day, there are other ways you can help all year long. There are more than 150 national cemeteries and monument sites maintained by such groups as the the Department of Veterans Affairs and the National Park Service. Read more about them or find a volunteer opportunity at a cemetery near you. The Department of Veterans Affairs has these tips on ways you can help at a veterans cemetery that you might not have considered: . -- Volunteer to greet visitors, give tours or research and document cemetery history . -- Donate items such as golf carts, which are used to transport visitors who need assistance reaching a gravesite . -- Volunteer to raise and lower cemetery flags on national holidays . -- Help maintain the final resting place of fallen troops by volunteering to prune trees, mend cemetery flags, repair cemetery benches or sponsor a burial area or flower bed and maintain it all year long . -- If you're a bugler, volunteer to play a live ""Taps"" at veterans' funerals. About 1,800 veterans die each day, most of them from World War II, according to the VA. Because the military cannot provide enough buglers to play at such a large number of funerals, Congress passed a law in 2000 to allow a recorded version to be played. But many families of the fallen prefer a live version if possible.","Volunteering time at a nearby veterans cemetery can be a way to honor the fallen at Memorial Day .

"(CNN) -- A timeline of events leading to the April 20 explosion on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico, according to documents from congressional investigators and testimony from witnesses to the disaster: . ^12:35 a.m. Oilfield services contractor Halliburton completes cementing on BP's Mississippi Canyon 252 well. In the hours leading up to midafternoon, crews conduct three positive pressure tests, in which fluid weight is placed on the seal. ^11 a.m. BP and Transocean executives argue over changes in the drill plan for the well at a meeting aboard the rig. ^5:05 p.m. An unexpected loss of fluid is observed in the riser pipe, suggesting there are leaks in the blowout preventer, a critical piece of equipment designed to shut down the well in the event of an emergency. ^5-7 p.m. Negative pressure tests, in which crews reduce fluid pressure to test for leaks through the cement or well casing, show unexpected results. One draws 15 barrels of liquid out of the well instead of the expected five, raising more concerns about leaks. In a second, pressure on the rig's ""kill line"" -- a high-pressure pipe used to cut off the flow of oil -- falls to zero, while rising to 1,400 pounds per square inch in the drill line, indicating a buildup of natural gas. ^8 p.m. BP ends testing and proceeds to replace remaining drill fluids with seawater. A BP investigator later suggests this is a ""fundamental mistake."" ^9:00 p.m. More fluid is reported flowing out of the well than is being pumped in. ^9:10 p.m. Well pump is shut down for a ""sheen"" test, but the well continues to flow. Drill pipe pressure unexpectedly increases. ^9:30 p.m. Abnormal pressures and more fluid returns are observed. The well pump is abruptly shut down. ^9:50 p.m. Gas surges from the well and up the riser. The supply ship Damon B. Bankston, which is tied up alongside Deepwater Horizon, reports drilling fluid spilling onto its deck and is told to move back 500 meters from the rig. Seconds later, the first explosion occurs. ^9:52 p.m. Deepwater Horizon issues distress call. The order is given to abandon the rig. Eleven of the 126 on board are lost at sea when the platform sinks two days later.","Documents from Congress, witness testimony detail events before leak .

"Washington (CNN) -- Vowing to continue to ""underwrite global security"" -- but not alone -- the Obama administration Thursday released its first National Security Strategy, a 52-page outline of the president's strategic approach and priorities. The NSS, required by Congress of every administration to be prepared every four years, for the first time combines homeland security and national security, focusing not only on threats internationally but on the threat of home-grown radicals inspired and recruited by al Qaeda. ""We view this as an important and emerging challenge,"" Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser for strategic communication, told reporters. Al Qaeda, he said, is less capable of using safe havens for training abroad and is now ""trying to inspire Americans to carry out attacks on the U.S."" Those Americans, he said, may have less direct contact with the terrorist organization but they carry American passports and know the strengths and weaknesses of the United States. ""Several recent incidents of violent extremists in the United States who are committed to fighting here and abroad have underscored the threat to the United States and our interests posed by individuals radicalized at home,"" the NSS states. ""Our best defenses against this threat are well informed and equipped families, local communities and institutions."" Federal, state and local governments will use intelligence, expanded community engagement and development programs to help local communities address the radicalization of Americans before they join al Qaeda, Rhodes said. There already is an interagency process, he said, devoted to countering radicalization. This is a ""new point of emphasis,"" he said, because it is a new point of emphasis for America's enemies. Laying out its strategy for more traditional areas of national security, the National Security Strategy stresses the importance of working with other nations to deal with challenges to ""renew American leadership."" ""It's a broader view of national security than before,"" Rhodes said. Echoing themes going back to the days of Obama's campaign for president, it says the U.S. must use ""engagement"" with friends and foes. The United States must engage also with other ""21st century centers of influence -- including China, India and Russia,"" the report says. In a switch from the Bush administration's doctrine of pre-emptive war, the Obama NSS says the United States will ""draw on diplomacy, development, and international norms and institutions to resolve disagreements, prevent conflict, and maintain peace, mitigating wherever possible the need for the use of force."" ""While the use of force is sometimes necessary,"" it says, ""we will exhaust other options before war whenever we can, and carefully weigh the costs and risks of action against the costs and risks of inaction."" The NSS also highlights ""burden sharing,"" working with other countries to deal with international threats. ""The U.S. needs to foster burden-sharing so it's not on our shoulders alone,"" Rhodes told reporters. The administration's focus on domestic terrorism is drawing some criticism from opponents who claim it ""ignores reality' by avoiding terms like ""radical Islam."" The ranking member of the Committee on Homeland Security, Republican U.S. Rep. Peter T. King, while saying he was ""heartened"" the strategy addresses the issue of home-grown terrorism, charged that ""the Obama Administration refuses to even identify head-on the threat our nation faces. Even though we have been at war against radical Islamic jihadists since they killed almost 3,000 Americans on 9/11, the Obama administration fails to even mention such terms.""","The Obama administration on Thursday released its first National Security  Strategy .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- The Israeli government said Thursday it will stop a convoy of cargo and passenger ships filled with supplies and headed to Gaza to break a blockade imposed by Israel in 2007. Government officials said Wednesday they have given the Israeli Defense Forces instructions to reroute the flotilla to Ashdod port in Israel, where the supplies will be unloaded and transferred to Gaza. Mark Regev, an Israeli government spokesman, called the flotilla ""a cheap political stunt."" ""If they were really interested in the well being of the people of Gaza, they would have accepted the offers of Egypt or Israel to transfer humanitarian aid to the people  of Gaza, along with the other 15 thousand tons sent every week,"" he said. The convoy, which left various European ports, is organized by two major groups: the Free Gaza movement, a pro-Palestinian human rights organization, and the IHH movement, a Turkish humanitarian relief foundation affiliated with the Islamic Brotherhood. Organizers said the convoy is carrying 10,000 tons of construction material, medical equipment and school supplies, and about 750 activists of different nationalities. Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said Yossi Gal, its director-general, has summoned the ambassadors of Turkey, Greece, Cyprus, Sweden and Ireland -- the countries from which the flotilla set sail -- and ""clarified the state of Israel's official position, which declares the flotilla an absolute provocation: There is no shortage of humanitarian aid to Gaza, as food products, fuel and supplies are constantly transferred into the Gaza Strip by the international organizations."" The flotilla is ""invited to dock at Ashdod port, to unload their cargo and transfer it to Gaza, after a security check, either via the Israeli authorities or via the humanitarian organizations,"" the ministry said. Hanin Zoabi, a member of Israel's parliament, the Knesset, and a passenger on the flotilla, called it a ""humanitarian campaign for the 1.5 million Palestinian people who Israel put in jail for about the last four years without allowing building material, without educational material, without food into the Gaza strip. ""Israel destroyed 165 schools and more than 100 (factories) and destroyed tens of thousands of houses without enabling the Palestinians to rebuild their homes and their lives,"" Zoabi said. ""This is a very strong political message towards Israel and towards the Arab world that stood silent regarding what is happening in Gaza."" Israel imposed the naval blockade on Gaza after the Hamas forcefully took control of  Gaza in 2007, ousting the Fatah movement headed by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. Regev argued that the activists maintain a double standard when it comes to Hamas' actions. ""They call themselves human rights activists, but they remain silent when it comes to Hamas' deliberate targeting of Israeli civilians  and the brutalities of the Hamas regime in Gaza, which has crushed political opposition, suppressed independent media and has locked up hundreds of political opponents."" Sarah Weiss Maudi, an Israeli Foreign Ministry legal expert, said, ""The naval blockade has been imposed by Israel because Israel is currently in a state of armed conflict with the Hamas regime that controls Gaza."" Under international maritime law, when a maritime blockade is in effect, no vessels can enter the blockaded area. Maritime blockades are a legitimate measure under international law, and may be implemented as part of an armed conflict at sea, Israeli officials have said. ""The objective of the boats is to break Israel's siege on Gaza, to break Israel's blockade on Gaza. The material that we have on board are all of the materials that Israel denied to the people of Gaza like cement, building supplies, educational supplies etc,"" said Greta Berlin, co-founder of Free Gaza movement. ""We do not accept the siege on Gaza,"" said Zoabi. ""... Israel does not want a siege. It wants a silent siege. Israel does not want occupation, it wants a silent occupation. It wants its policies to go without criticisms of the world. That's why it wants to stop the flotilla and also avoid coverage of the event,"" she said. ""... This is an important aim of Israel, is to stop the cameras in order for the participants who are participating in this flotilla and the others who are following it not to see the aggression of the Israeli army, but I think this does not threaten us and it does not bring fear among us,"" she said. Noam Shalit, father of captive Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, told CNN he offered through his lawyer to attempt to convince the Israeli government to let the flotilla arrive in Gaza if participants would pass aid, including letters and medicine, to his son. The organizers of the convoy, including Berlin, refused, he said, telling him their main purpose is to break the siege. Gilad Shalit has been held captive since June 2006, when Palestinian militants from Gaza captured him. Noam Shalit says his son has been kept in total isolation for the past four years, a violation of international conventions and against international law. There have been eight naval convoys to Gaza until now, and Israel has allowed three to dock at the Gaza port. Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said that since January 2009, more than a million tons of humanitarian supplies entered Gaza from Israel. The most efficient system to transfer goods to Gaza is through the land crossings, Palmor said. Asked if he was concerned about being arrested, Zoabi told CNN, ""I am not worried because I am not doing anything against the law. What I do is according to human rights, according to international values and according to universal values, so it is not against the law. ""I am (a) Knesset member, and this is part of my political responsibility,"" she said. ""It is part of my human responsibility. This is not against the law to aid people, to help and support (those) who are under siege ... I think the side that is breaking the law, international law, and breaking the human values is Israel and not anyone else.""

"(CNN) -- Sugar lovers may have to face a bitter truth: The less sugar added to foods for typical people, the better are their blood-fat profiles and the lower are their cardiovascular risks, a study to be published Wednesday concludes. ""We found that the lower the amount of added sugar people ate, the better their good cholesterol and their blood triglyceride levels,"" said co-author Dr. Miriam B. Vos, assistant professor of pediatrics at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, and author of ""The No-Diet Obesity Solution for Kids."" Unfortunately for dessert lovers, the converse is true. Increased sugars are associated with important cardiovascular disease risk factors, according to the report. The authors cited lower levels of HDL-C, which is sometimes referred to as the good cholesterol, and higher levels of triglycerides. The study, to be published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, highlights a trend some nutritionists consider disturbing: In recent years, the typical American's diet has increasingly incorporated added sugars. The authors defined them as ""caloric sweeteners used by the food industry and consumers as ingredients in processed or prepared foods to increase the desirability of those foods."" Data from the mid-1990s show that 15.8 percent of the typical American's diet was composed of added sugar -- 21.4 teaspoons or 359 calories per day. That's up from 10.6 percent in 1977-1978. Added sugars have been linked to obesity, diabetes and tooth decay. The researchers studied 6,113 adults enrolled in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Interviewers called them and asked what they had eaten the previous day, then estimated the total added sugar in each person's diet. Participants were then separated into groups: Those who got less than 5 percent of total calories from added sugar; 5 percent to less than 10 percent; 10 percent to less than 17.5 percent; 17.5 percent to less than 25 percent; and 25 percent or more. Those in the highest-consuming added sugar group eat about 46 teaspoons of added sugar per day, the study said. Those who consumed more added sugar tended to be younger, non-Latino blacks with low income, it said. The report says 18.5 percent of Americans get at least 25 percent of their calories from added sugar. The strongest relationship between added sugar and blood fats was found in values for HDL-C, which fell from 58.7 mg/dl for those who ate the least added sugar to 47.7 mg/dl for those who ate the most. A higher HDL-C level is associated with a lower cardiovascular risk. Among some blood fats linked to higher cardiovascular risk, the converse was true: Triglyceride levels went from 105 mg/dl in the group that ate the least sugar to 114 mg/dl in the group that ate the most. The so-called bad cholesterol, LDL-C, went from 116 mg/dl for women who ate the least sugar to 123 mg/dl for women who ate the most. There were no significant trends for LDL-C among men. The authors concluded that their data support dietary guidelines that aim to cut consumption of added sugar. But those guidelines are all over the map. The Institute of Medicine recommends no more than 25 percent of total energy from added sugars; the World Health Organization recommends less than 10 percent; and the American Heart Association has recently advised no more than 100 calories per day for women and 150 calories per day for men, which works out to about 5 percent. ""What it really means is we have to go back to things like whole grains and vegetables and fruit and eat things in moderation in order to be healthy,"" Vos said. ""Plus, a good healthy dose of activity."" But the study compiled data based on a single day's consumption, and it was not clear whether that day was representative of other days, she said. ""We don't know that all of the people had their usual diet the day before,"" she said. ""There are always some weaknesses in that kind of data."" Carbohydrates have been linked for decades to abnormal blood fat levels, ""but a big contemporary issue is added sugars,"" said Dr. Frank Sacks, professor of nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts. Vos' study ""fills in a gap in the science base."" The study will likely be discussed next month when the American Heart Association takes up the matter of added sugars at its meeting in Washington, he said. ""We just overeat too damn much,"" he said. ""What this study is saying is that, for some groups -- especially young people, black, poor -- sugar is just way too big a proportion of their intake."" ""The real truth is that we're supposed to eat a balanced diet, less processed food,"" said Carla Wolper, a nutritionist at the Obesity Research Center at St. Luke's Hospital in New York and assistant professor at Columbia University's Eating Disorders Center. Wolper praised the study for its size and careful construction. But Dr. Richard K. Bernstein, a diabetes specialist based in Mamaroneck, New York, was unimpressed. ""This is just one more study showing that carbohydrates create abnormal lipid profiles,"" he said.","Added sugar is associated with cardiovascular disease risk factors, study finds .

"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- Growing up, Jean-Manuel Beauchamp attended no ball games with his grandfather. No barbecues, either, or bedtime stories. Beauchamp, now 20, was 4 months old when the United States invaded Panama and seized his  grandfather. Noriega was later convicted on drug charges and sentenced to 30 years in prison, reduced to 17 for good behavior. Now, three years after the end of his prison term, Beauchamp's grandad -- former Panamanian military dictator Manuel Noriega -- remains behind bars pending Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's decision whether to sign extradition documents. That outcome will likely come sooner rather than later. The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday turned down Noriega's request for a new hearing, setting the stage for his extradition to France, where he has been convicted in abstentia on money laundering charges and faces a new trial. ""It's all up to Hillary now,"" Beauchamp said. ""There's not much hope in the courts any longer."" President Obama has a role to play as well, Beauchamp said, but he held out little hope that the president would intercede. ""I don't think he's being informed about this case, and it's still being ignored, just like the Bush administration did,"" he said. ""I'm trying not to let this affect me. I just got off the phone with my grandfather. He was adamant about making this injustice known,"" he said. Noriega's Miami attorneys plan to send Clinton a letter Friday asking that the former Panamanian strongman be returned to his home country of Panama. Noriega's trial judge declared him a prisoner of war after his drug and money laundering conviction in 1992. Because of that status, he and his attorneys believe he should have been returned to Panama -- where he would face murder charges -- when his sentence ended in 2007. But the federal courts have ruled against him, and he has remained in prison south of Miami. ""He was adamant about staying in Miami this whole time,"" said Beauchamp. ""His attitude now is 'whatever happens happens.' "" Noriega is charged in France with depositing drug money in French banks and using drug money to buy apartments in Paris. He faces up to 10 years in prison there, but his attorneys believe France would not honor his status as a prisoner of war. He faces 20 years on murder and human rights abuse charges in Panama, but Panamanian law would allow him to serve his sentence under house arrest because of his age. The United States holds his fate and must decide whether to honor France's extradition request or send Noriega home. ""They must also consider the seriousness of the charges,"" said Jon May, Noriega's appellate attorney. ""Noriega is wanted for murder in Panama. We're not asking for sympathy from Secretary Clinton, but to recognize there are larger issues,"" he said. Further, he said, ""Panama made the request first, and he is a citizen of Panama, not France."" Beauchamp also believes that Panama's case should come first, but he is willing to go with his grandfather wherever he's sent. ""I told him I will follow him to be with him there, in France, but he said, no, I should stay and work on my studies,"" said Beauchamp. Beauchamp is a film student in New York. He says that he doesn't know anything about his grandfather's past or the drug charges that put him in prison. He was far too young to hear the stories about how Manuel Noriega was once on the CIA's payroll. ""When I was a kid, I didn't grow up knowing he was in prison. I thought he was in school,"" said Beauchamp. The two have spent quite a bit of time talking both in person and on the phone. Beauchamp said they talk about the present, not the past, and his famous grandfather has motivated him, helping him learn from his own experiences. ""I've spent quality time with him, but not private time,"" he said, alluding to prison security and the monitoring of conversations. ""He's the smartest man I know. He's so friendly, outgoing, knowledgable. He's always looking to teach or give advice,"" he said. The U.S. government has portrayed Noriega as the ultimate crooked cop -- a man who was paid millions by the Medellin drug cartel to protect cocaine and money shipments. Panamanians remember him as a cruel dictator. But the former Panamanian leader has said his relationship with the United States soured when he refused to help the United States take part in acts of sabotage against the communist Nicaraguan government during the Cold War-era, anti-communist efforts spearheaded by the CIA in Central America during the 1980s. Noriega said that when he refused to help the United States, his country was invaded. Noriega was arrested and taken to Miami to stand trial on the drug charges. During the invasion, 23 U.S. troops were killed, as were about 200 Panamanian citizens. Beauchamp said he wants to learn more about his homeland of Panama. He grew up in Miami, but his sense is that Panama never really wanted his grandfather back there to stand trial and is still reeling from the 1989 U.S. invasion. ""Panama needs closure, and I feel Panama has not wanted him back. Panama is still suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder,"" he said. In the meantime, Beauchamp said that his grandfather reads and prays a lot and still has a soldier's mentality. ""He's ready for anything. He's probably developed strategies, in his own mind, to emotionally prepare. He's been packed for 2½ years waiting,"" he said. ""The U.S. should be escorting him back to Panama, from where they took him.""","Ex-Panamanian military dictator in jail as he awaits extradition decision .

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- A court in eastern China sentenced a man to death Saturday for attacking 29 kindergarten students and three teachers with a knife, state-run media said. The Taixing Intermediate People's Court found Xu Yuyuan, 47, guilty of intentional homicide after a half-day trial, Xinhua news agency said. Xu told the court that his rage against society motivated him in the April 29 attacks, according to Xinhua. But he appealed the death sentence, arguing that the punishment was too severe since no one died in the attacks, Xinhua said. Chinese penal code says a person can be convicted of intentional homicide for acting on an intent to kill, the news agency reported. A police probe found Xu had been unemployed since 2001, when he was fired by a local insurance company. He told police he carried out the attack because he was angry about a series of business and personal humiliations, Xinhua said. About 300 people attended Saturday's open trial, according to Xinhua. Xu's sentence was the second death penalty conviction after a recent spate of school attacks that have prompted public outrage across China. Zheng Minsheng, 42, was sentenced to death and executed on April 28 for attacking students in front of an elementary school in Fujian province, killing eight and wounding several others. Zheng also used a knife in the attacks, Xinhua reported. Authorities said Zheng carried out the attack because he was frustrated at ""failures in his romantic life,"" the news agency said. At least four other such attacks on school children in China have been reported since March. Guns are strictly regulated in China, but until recently large knives were not. Chinese authorities have recently issued a regulation requiring people to register with their national ID cards when they buy knives longer that 15 centimeters. Other measures have been put in place. In April, the Ministry of Education ordered kindergartens, elementary and secondary schools to restrict strangers from entering the campuses. The ministry instructed schools across the country to hire security guards, install security facilities and ensure that pupils were escorted home. Schools were also urged to teach pupils to how to protect themselves. In some schools, security guards have been armed with ""forks,"" long poles with semi-circular prongs that can be used to fight assailants.","Xu Yuyuan, 47, found guilty of intentional homicide over April attack .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- The children of a Los Angeles woman found dead at a Mexican resort last month will not be allowed to attend a memorial service for their mother Sunday, a judge ruled Friday. A therapist hired by their father, a former ""Survivor"" producer named a ""person of interest"" in the investigation of his wife's death, said the service could be emotionally harmful to the young children. Mexican authorities detained the father, Bruce Beresford-Redman, as a suspect the day his wife's body's was found. He was released a day later. Sunday's memorial service is planned by Monica Beresford-Redman's sisters, who are also fighting for custody of the children. ""We respect the decision of the court, but we are very disappointed the fact that the children were denied to participate in the celebration of their mother's life,"" Jeane Burgos said. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff delayed any decision on changing the current custody arrangement. Beresford-Redman's parents were given temporary custody last month after he was told by Mexican police to remain in the country while they investigated. He recently returned to Los Angeles and filed papers for custody to be returned to him. The maternal sisters have also petitioned for permanent custody of the children, ages 3 and 5. Beresford-Redman was not in court Friday because of the swarm of reporters at the Los Angeles County courthouse, his criminal defense lawyer said. Defense Attorney Richard Hirsch used the gathering of journalists to ask that there not be ""a rush to judgment"" about Beresford-Redman. He said there have been other unsolved deaths and an attack at the Moon Palace resort, where Monica Beresford-Redman's body was found in a sewer. Hirsch cited the death of an elderly Scottish woman, who was found in a swamp weeks after leaving a pool for a walk, and a Canadian man who allegedly fell from a hotel balcony. Jeff Toews, a Canadian, was found dead in May 2007. Investigators decided he died from a drunken fall from a balcony, but his family did not accept that explanation. Julia Howard, a 77-year-old woman from Scotland, was found dead in a dense swamp six weeks after disappearing from a pool area last summer. Her family also rejected the police conclusion that her death was an accident. A woman reported an attempted rape in her hotel room ""several days after Mrs. Beresford-Redman's body was discovered,"" Hirsch said. ""We have brought this to the attention of the authorities and, in particular, to the attorney general in Cancun and asked them to pursue all leads before making a decision whether of not to charge our client,"" Hirsch said. ""We feel that this case should not be a rush to judgment."" ""There are strange things going on, I think, that need to be pursued,"" he said. A spokeswoman for the resort has not responded to a CNN request for comment. The initial investigation suggested Monica Beresford-Redman ""died of strangulation because of the bruising,"" Mexican regional police spokesman Adrian Cardena said. A source close to the wife has told CNN that she cleaned out the family bank account and took her two children to Hawaii because she was upset about her husband's extramarital affair. The couple later traveled to Cancun in an effort to repair their marriage, the source said. Bruce Beresford-Redman built his career as a Hollywood reality television show producer. He worked for several seasons on the popular CBS show ""Survivor,"" in which contestants compete against each other in a variety of extreme outdoor scenarios. He was nominated for three Emmy Awards as a producer on the show and was last credited as a producer in 2004. He also worked on NBC's ""The Contender"" and ""The Restaurant,"" as well as MTV's ""Pimp My Ride,"" according to entertainment media company IMG.

"(CNN)  -- A Dutch entrepreneur is hoping to construct the biggest indoor golf center in the world in the Netherlands which he believes will revolutionize the sport's leisure industry. The vast 18,000 square-meter bubble will house a plethora of golf practice facilities, including chipping greens, bunkers and water hazards. The latest golf simulators will offer the choice of the top golf courses in the world, plus a rooftop 34-bay driving range with the latest high-tech swing analysis. Add in a golf shop of over 1,000 square meters, a fitness and health center and a five-star hotel, restaurants and business conference facilities and the scale of the project becomes clear. The drawback is the €50 million ($66.59 million) price tag and a prominent site big enough to house a complex bigger than a major football stadium in a densely populated country. But Standing, who has patented the term Indoor Golf Arena and hopes to franchise the concept, is unabashed even during a global recession. ""Traditional real estate developments and housing offices are suffering and investors are looking for alternatives in leisure which are becoming an increasingly attractive proposition,"" he told CNN. Standing also believes that the Netherlands, which has 350,000 golfers and an annual growth rate of over 10 per cent, not to mention excellent transport links to other parts of continental Europe, is the ideal location. ""This is actually meant to put everything that makes golf a way of life under one roof,"" he said. He told CNN that two sites near The Hague and Rotterdam had been earmarked for the project and said he hoped to begin building in 2012 with ""huge interest"" among investors from the Middle East. The ambitious project also has the backing of the PGA of Europe and the Dutch golf federation. It is part of a trend which has seen the sport go inside with simulators enabling golfers of all standards to play the world's classic courses without stepping outside and in all weathers. In South Korea, where courses are at a premium and memberships expensive, the numbers of golf cafes with simulators have grown exponentially while London-based operator Urban Golf told CNN it is expanding fast. Virtual screens replace greens . Marketing director David Richter says they have been successful because  changes in lifestyle has put leisure time at a premium. ""If you just want to have a quick game with friends you don't have to take a whole day out of your diary, you can do it in an hour,"" he said. Richter also believes that indoor operators have removed the barriers to playing at a traditional club. ""You don't need to be a member or have a handicap certificate to play, there's no stuffy dress code or clubhouse rules."" But whatever the advantages of indoor golf, will it replace the real thing ? Andy Calton, the Editor in Chief of Today's Golfer, says that simulators and state-of-the-art indoor centers may indeed replace the traditional driving range, but told CNN there was no substitute for the outdoor experience. ""These places may well but the future of golf practice but as for being the future of golf, I'm not convinced,"" he said. ""I still think people want to play on a real course and find their ball in real trees!"" he added. Standing hopes his venture will boost golf standards in his native Netherlands with top players having access to the latest practice facilities, but also believes the model of traditional golf club membership is eroding as more and more players turn to a green fee-pay-and-play game. In that context, he believes his venture will flourish and he wants to franchise the idea around the world. ""Indoor Golf Arena will be the place to be for every golfer,"" boasts the mission statement on the project's Web site, only time will tell whether the bubble will float or burst.","Planned indoor golf center in the Netherlands would be the biggest of its kind .

"PHOENIX, Arizona (CNN) -- Thirty-year-old Lisa Locascio is walking through what she hopes will soon be her new living room. Lisa Locascio is trying to buy her first home with help from the federal Neighborhood Stabilization Program. ""The carpet's clearly trashed, but that's going to get ripped out,"" she says. She's excited to become a first-time homebuyer and has been shopping exclusively for foreclosed homes in the Phoenix, Arizona, area for several weeks now. ""It's the American dream,"" Locascio says of home ownership, and she's just zeroed in on the one she wants to be hers. She has a bid in and is waiting to hear on her offer. Financially strapped prospective buyers like Locascio have discovered hope in the Neighborhood Stabilization Program, a year-old federal program designed to help stabilize communities decimated by foreclosures and abandonment. Families and individuals who qualify can get a loan of up to $15,000 to cover down payment and closing costs of foreclosed homes. The amount varies by region, but can amount to tens of thousands of dollars. Congress approved the nationwide program in July 2008, pumping a total of $3.92 billion into the hardest-hit communities. Almost $2 billion more was allocated in May. A total of $121 million in funding arrived in Arizona in April, and the Phoenix area received the largest cut, approximately $39.4 million. Program watch dogs are keeping their eyes on states like Arizona to see how the money will be spent and whether it will make a difference. Arizona had the fourth highest rate of new foreclosures in May, according to Realty Trac. With such a high foreclosure rate, the funds allocated to Arizona, and in particular the Phoenix area, were significant. However, not one home in Phoenix has been purchased using the NSP funds despite hundreds of applications. People are still trying to navigate an unfamiliar process, housing experts in Phoenix say. Locascio would be thrilled to be the first person to close on a home. She is single and works as a project manager at a Scottsdale asset management company. However, she currently has no savings. After recently providing financial assistance to a relative -- a move that depleted her bank account -- Locascio admits she never thought she'd be able to afford a home of her own any time soon. She's unable to meet the 3.5 percent down payment required for the most affordable government-backed home loans; therefore, she had resigned herself to paying rent until she was able to recoup her savings. That's when a friend, Lance Connolly, a Phoenix Realtor, told Locascio of the Neighborhood Stabilization Program. ""My Realtor filled me in on it, and then I did some research on it and decided that would probably be the best route to take,"" Locascio says. The program is limited to applicants with incomes between $55,350 and $104,400, depending on family size, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The income limits vary from region to region. Applicants must also complete eight hours of financial counseling and courses in budgeting and home ownership, and be able to invest $1,000 of their own money. Under the Neighborhood Stabilization Program, HUD requires the lender to give buyers a 15% discount below the appraised value and the loan must be paid back in full when the homeowner sells the home or refinances. Lenders are not required, however, to accept a discounted offer. Once approved for the maximum loan, Locascio wasted little time in locating and bidding on a property she liked. Although Locascio's bid was $30,000 less than the listing price, offers like hers are common in the Phoenix area. On any given day in 2009, real estate listings can show more than 25,000 foreclosed single family homes available. Locascio said, ""I'd be disappointed"" if the bank turned down her offer. Locascio has good credit, and so she qualified for a $275,000 fixed-rate mortgage using the approved federal funds. She believes taking the mandated classes taught her the importance of personal affordability. ""I liked the programs, the counseling and things like that that teach you not to live outside your means... I don't want to be house poor,"" Locascio said. Under the scenario of her bid, Locascio would only have to come up with about $1,500 on her own for earnest money and appraisal costs. If approved, her monthly mortgage payment would actually be $180 less than what she is paying to rent for a two-bedroom, 900-square foot apartment. Connolly has been in the Phoenix real estate market for about nine years and has seen the disastrous real estate downturn up close. He hopes to soon see more clients using NSP funding. ""It's just kind of coming out now that people are understanding it's there. I don't think they have done a very big promotion... put it on billboards or anything like that to say, 'Hey, this is available to you,'"" Connolly said. Until now, Connolly said, Internet-savvy house hunters have had to discover the program on their own. Experts want to caution those who think the Neighborhood Stabilization Program will solve Phoenix's devastated real estate market. John Smith, president of Mesa, Arizona-based Housing Our Communities, a nonprofit that helps people find affordable housing, says that won't happen. ""We have to identify those goals, those strategies and those resources that are going to make a difference,"" he says. ""This is not, in and of itself, going to do that."" He compares the program to a Band-Aid, cautioning, ""It is only one tool ... we're going to have to find some other solutions to stabilize these communities."" Communities are visibly ailing all across the area, with some of the hardest-hit neighborhoods nearly abandoned by foreclosures. Homes are boarded up and weeds cover the ""For Sale"" and ""For Rent"" signs in thousands of yards. ""It's overwhelming when you look at the numbers,"" Smith said, noting that Phoenix still records roughly 8,000 new foreclosure notices every month. Smith estimates the loan program will probably help only about 1,000 families acquire homes across the Phoenix metro area. Nonprofit housing assistance programs such as Smith's are available in many cities across the country to educate and counsel prospective home buyers and inform them of available assistance. However, Smith cautions it's not just about quick ownership. ""We just don't want houses to be bought and sold. We want families to invest and develop affordable, sustainable home ownership throughout the community."" Smith urges patience and warns it will take full cooperation for all sectors to turn the housing crisis around. ""We have to encourage the private sector, the banking industry, the mortgage industry to also get involved and provide product that makes it possible for families to buy houses. It all can't be federal money,"" Smith said. Less than 24 hours after submitting her bid, Locascio received a call from the bank. After watching the property sit foreclosed and idle on the market for almost two months, she was informed that someone else beat her bid by only a few hours. Despite the funding assistance, Locascio quickly learned there are no assurances or guarantees in the federally funded home buying process. She later found two more places she likes and placed bids on them. She hopes one of the banks will come through quickly and make her a new homeowner, the first to use funds from the Neighborhood Stabilization Program.","Arizona has one of the highest foreclosure rates in the country .

"Palm Beach, Florida (CNN) -- For years, Army veteran Roy Foster's motto has been ""No man left behind."" This month, he's broadened it to include women. In November, Foster was recognized at ""CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute"" as a Top 10 CNN Hero of 2009 for his efforts to help male veterans struggling with homelessness and addiction. His nonprofit, Faith*Hope*Love*Charity, has provided food, housing, counseling, employment and medical services to more than 1,100 veterans. ""I was somewhat overwhelmed at the tribute. To be a part of something that you love doing -- to be honored in doing it was, you know, strange,"" recalled Foster, 54. ""But then to be showcased internationally was tremendous. And it's still reaping benefits today."" Among those benefits is Foster's recent opening of the First Stop Resource Center and Housing Program in Palm Beach, Florida. The center and program widen the scope of support services his organization has been offering through its original Stand Down House. They also bring Foster's long-held dream to fruition. ""Twenty years ago, the dream was to be able to provide assistance and services for homeless veterans and their entire family,"" he said. ""We did come up with Stand Down House 10 years ago, but there was never that support for the family or the female veterans. This year, we've been fortunate enough to complete that vision."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2010 CNN Heroes . The First Stop Resource Center assists veterans and their families through various periods of crises, including homelessness and addiction. Before its addition, Foster and his team had to send veterans in need from one partner aid agency to another over multiple days, in multiple locations -- increasing the risk of losing clients back to the streets. At the new resource center, veterans in need are able to meet with any of First Stop's 15 community aid partners under one roof in a single visit. They can receive assistance with housing, legal, medical care, employment, child care, education, pensions, food stamps and transportation needs. ""We were looking to establish a place where we will not lose them in that process of 'hurry up and wait,' "" Foster said. ""We want to centralize it. We want to get their needs addressed and ... get these service members back out into the community. That's what it's about."" First Stop's housing program is geared toward female veterans and veterans with children. Set adjacent to the organization's original Stand Down House for male veterans, the two new residence buildings can provide temporary housing for up to eight single female veterans and two small families. It is only the second transitional housing facility in the nation available to veterans with children, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. ""We're trying to empower the family structure, because if the family struggles, the soldier struggles. When the soldier struggles, it puts everyone at risk,"" Foster said. Barbara Williams is First Stop's first female resident. An Operation Desert Storm veteran, Williams fell on hard times after losing her job last year. Now, she and her daughters have a roof over their heads and the hope of better days to come. ""My pride is restored,"" said Williams, 40. ""I'm able to just go off to look for jobs and not worry about where am I going to go when I come home. It's just so much relief."" The seed money for the new housing facility arrived shortly after Foster was announced as a Top 10 CNN Hero. A local veteran and recovering addict who was touched by Foster's story approached him with a donation that covered the first year's housing budget, about $44,000. The furnishings were donated by a local veterans' motorcycle club. ""Believe it, there are people in America that do care, and we were blessed to come across these individuals,"" Foster said. ""And the thing that I appreciate the most is it is done for veterans by veterans. ... We are going to leave no man, or woman or family behind."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- A Nevada man was found guilty Thursday of raping and strangling a 19-year-old student in a string of attacks that rattled the university community in Reno two years ago. A Washoe County, Nevada, jury convicted James Michael Biela, 28, of first-degree murder and sexual assault in the death of Brianna Denison. He was also convicted of two counts of sexual assault for attacks on two other women. He was also convicted of one count of kidnapping related to one of those attacks. The father and former construction worker faces the death penalty. Denison, a sophomore at Santa Barbara City College in California, was last seen alive on her friend's couch on January 20, 2008. Three weeks later, her body was found in a field near her friend's home. She had been sexually assaulted and strangled. A pair of panties that did not belong to Denison were found near the body, in what police said was a ""calling card"" that helped them connect Biela not only to Denison, but also to the other assaults. From the witness stand in Biela's capital murder trial, one of the women recounted how she was attacked on the University of Nevada-Reno campus. She said her assailant threatened her with a gun, raped her and took her panties as a souvenir. The defense challenged the identification because she earlier told a friend she could not describe her attacker to police. The second woman, a student at the university, testified she was abducted outside her apartment and driven to a dark area and raped in the attacker's vehicle. The woman testified that her assailant asked for her panties and took them with him. The trial began with emotional testimony from Denison's mother, her boyfriend, and a video showing her with friends at a diner just a few hours before she was abducted. Denison was visiting friends in her hometown of Reno. After they attended a concert, she slept on the living room couch in a friend's off-campus apartment. While she slept, someone crept into the apartment and snatched her, police and prosecutors said. Her case triggered a flurry of national media coverage and thousands of tips, including the one that led to Biela's arrest. Police released a photo of the panties near Denison's body and a description of the pickup truck. A friend of Biela's girlfriend saw the photo of the panties, and thought she recognized the truck police described. She told investigators a friend's boyfriend had a truck similar to the description, and that her friend had seen women's panties inside it. Detectives immediately followed up on the tip and, with permission from the girlfriend, took DNA samples from Biela's 4-year-old son. Lab tests showed that the boy's father -- Biela -- was almost certainly a match for the DNA found on the doorknob and at the crime scene, police said. DNA obtained from the other victim's rape kit matched Biela's, according to testimony. Biela's defense attorneys challenged the DNA testing method, claiming it was not accurate. CNN's Rupa Mikkilineni contributed to this report.","James Biela convicted in rape, murder of Brianna Denison, attacks on two women .

"(CNN) -- Iran should release seven Baha'i prisoners accused of espionage because it does not have any evidence against them, their lawyer Shirin Ebadi told CNN on Saturday. Attorneys Abdolfattah Soltani, left, and Shirin Ebadi, shown in Tehran in 2004. ""In the files, in the case basically, there is nothing, no reason that basically convicts them,"" said Ebadi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate. The trial will begin Tuesday despite the fact that one of their lawyers is behind bars and Ebadi is outside the country. Other attorneys can be appointed, Hassan Haddad of the Prosecutor's Office in Tehran told the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency. But the court must recognize the replacements, who are colleagues of Ebadi at her Tehran-based Defenders of Human Rights Center, not appoint other lawyers, Ebadi said. The imprisoned lawyer, Abdolfattah Soltani, is a well-known advocate with the human rights center. He was arrested in the aftermath of Iran's disputed June 12 presidential election and is being held at Evin prison, the same place where his clients are detained, according to the International Campaign for Human Rights. He is being held on charges of taking ""measures against national security,"" Ebadi said. ""Mr. Soltani is completely innocent."" Soltani had an opportunity to leave prison, but under conditions he chose not to accept, Ebadi said. Along with not giving any interviews after his release, Soltani would also have to end his work with the human rights center and no longer support Ebadi, she said. In another attack on the law firm, a lawyer was arrested after agents entered the center with guns, searched each room and then declared that they found opium on the premises, Ebadi said. That lawyer, whose family had been harassed by police, accused the agents of planting the opium, she said. Ebadi was on a speaking tour when Soltani was arrested and has not returned to Iran. The firm founded by Ebadi took up the case of the seven Baha'is last year. They are accused of spying for Israel, spreading propaganda against the Islamic republic and committing religious offenses. The Baha'i International Community, which has a delegation to the United Nations, denies the allegations. The evidence against the defendants includes communication from Israel, but that is because the Baha'i World Center has its headquarters in Israel, said Kit Bigelow, director of external affairs at the American Baha'i Community. Prosecutors are calling that communication espionage, she said. Human rights groups have demanded the release of the prisoners and accused the government of targeting them because of their religious beliefs. The Baha'i faith originated in 19th-century Persia, and while modern-day Iran does not recognize it, the government denies any mistreatment of the members of the largest non-Muslim religious minority. The International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran has reported a rise in persecution of Baha'is in recent years, including cemetery desecration, arbitrary detention, home raids, property confiscation, work expulsion and denial of basic civil rights. The case of the seven Baha'is has drawn global attention. Roxana Saberi, the Iranian-American journalist freed from Evin prison earlier this year, spoke on their behalf, as have Human Rights Watch and the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, an independent bipartisan federal commission. The defendants face the death penalty if convicted. Six of the defendants were arrested in May 2008 at their Tehran homes, and one was arrested in the eastern city of Mashad in March 2008, said Diane Ala'i, the Baha'i International Community's representative to the United Nations. The defendants were held under solitary confinement for the first five months of their incarceration, she said. The investigation into the charges against the prisoners concluded months ago and the trial was initially scheduled to start in July. Iran has continued to hold them in Evin prison without access to their lawyers and with minimal contact with their families, Ala'i said. CNN's Moni Basu contributed to this report.","Seven Baha'i prisoners accused of espionage to go on trial Tuesday in Iran .

"CRYSTAL LAKE, Illinois (CNN) -- Karin Kubacki no longer buys clothing or toys for her 7-year-old son, Max. Karin and Chris Kubacki are cutting back to make her severance and unemployment pay last a year. She avoids driving her 8-year-old Honda Civic unless absolutely necessary and has no plans to repair a second vehicle, an 11-year-old Ford F-250. Bubble baths and Hershey bars are now her few luxuries. These are among the cost-saving measures Kubacki is taking to make her 13 weeks of severance pay last a full year. Kubacki, the family breadwinner, was laid off July 1 from a job she loved -- software project manager at Accenture, where she had worked for 15 years. At first, she was stunned. ""I had this impression that someone had grabbed a big vacuum and sucked all the air out of the room. It was like I couldn't get my breath,"" she said. Her husband, a former schoolteacher who is a stay-at-home dad and a woodworker, feared for the family's financial future. ""At first there is the panic, 'Oh my gosh, we are going to lose the house tomorrow and live in a cardboard box,' "" Chris Kubacki recalled.  Watch the Kubackis discuss how they've handled Karin's job loss » . Yet his wife was determined to make her loss an opportunity to spend more time with the family while taking time to find another job she would love as much as the one she had just lost. So the Kubackis are trying to make Karin's severance, unemployment checks and some extra cash Accenture provided to pay for an extension of her health insurance last a full year. They are determined to keep paying the mortgage on their home in Crystal Lake, Illinois, a Chicago suburb, and not dig into savings -- all on an expected pre-tax income of $54,000, a little less than half of the family's normal earnings. ""We have been frugal people, and we have tried to save as much as we can, and that is one of the reasons why I have been able to stay home with Max,"" said Chris, who builds wooden toys for his son. But never have the Kubackis been as frugal as they are now. For the first time, the family is living by a strict budget. They are saving by: . • Biking and walking rather than driving, whenever possible . • Rarely going out to restaurants . • Finding enriching community activities for their child that cost little or nothing . • Taking out books from the library . • Purchasing only absolute necessities and buying what's on sale. ""There are no luxuries now. Before, we had a lot more where we could say, 'Let's go do this.' Now it's a lot more careful,"" Karin said. ""When I had a job, when I shopped, I would make impulse purchases. Now, no way."" Not only is diminished consumption not as painful as it might seem, the Kubackis say, but the change has also brought a fuller and more enjoyable lifestyle than at any time when Karin was earning a regular paycheck. ""We can have all kinds of fun doing things that don't cost anything,"" Chris said. Chris concedes he has felt internal pressure to get a job, but the couple agrees that for now, they prefer to avoid that to be able to spend as much time together and have Chris available for Max. After adopting a frugal lifestyle, the Kubackis say they now really appreciate life's little luxuries. ""If you pick just a couple of luxuries like Hershey bars, then you really enjoy 'em. And if you have a lot of luxuries, then they become necessities. But if you only have a couple, boy are they terrific,"" Karin said. Even though neither Karin nor Chris now hold jobs, they are still giving 10 percent of Karin's unemployment check to their church. Living only a few doors from the neighborhood food pantry, they see frequent reminders of their blessings. ""So I don't have a job right now,"" Karin said. ""We've got a house. We've got cars, we've got food. We have nothing to complain about."" Are you fighting the recession, using innovative techniques to stay ahead in this economy or overcoming financial adversity?

"(CNN) -- Australia's iconic Tasmanian devil -- widely known as trouble in Looney Tunes cartoons -- has been put on the country's endangered list, environmental officials announced Friday. The Tasmanian devil's future is threatened by a contagious facial cancer that has killed large numbers. ""My decision to uplist the Tasmanian devil is based on advice from the Threatened Species Scientific Committee, which lists the devil facial tumor disease as the major threat to the devil,"" Environment Minister Peter Garrett said in a statement. ""This disease has led to the decline of about 70 percent of the Tasmanian devil population since the disease was first reported in 1996."" The disease has devastated the animals, native to the Australian state of Tasmania, an island off the southeastern coast. Devil facial tumor disease is one of only three cancers known to spread like a contagious disease, according to the Tasmanian government's Web site. As the name implies, it causes tumors on the face and neck, and sometimes other parts of the body, and it's passed by biting. The Australian government has committed $7.8 million over five years to the Save the Tasmanian Devil program, according to Garrett. ""This is to help with research into disease transmission and treatment, and will support captive and wild populations,"" he said. In 2005, the program established a captive breeding insurance population. Disease-free animals were gathered from the wild population and are being bred on the mainland. ""As of February 2009, the insurance population had grown to 145 disease-free Tasmanian devils"" at 10 zoos and wildlife parks, the Tasmanian government said. ""The animals in this breeding program could play an important role, if ever needed, in helping re-establish healthy wild populations in Tasmania."" Although the image of the Tasmanian devil has been popularized around the world by the Looney Tunes cartoon character Taz, the real thing is a much different animal. The devil, the world's only surviving marsupial carnivore, is about 25 pounds (12 kg) of bad attitude, with a haunting cry that's a combination of snorting and growling.","Australia's iconic Tasmanian devil has been put on the endangered list .

"(CNN) -- As a concept, recycling has lived and died many times throughout its 4,000-year old history. But it always re-emerges as an idea when humans need it most, such as during the Great Depression, and later during World War II, when American companies recycled or reused around 25 percent of the waste stream. A sign in Cheshire, England signalling a recycling drop-off area. Today, the global recycling industry generates $160 billion a year, processing more than 500 million tons of materials. The industry is becoming one of the world's biggest employers. While the official amount of people employed by the industry is 1.5 million worldwide, the real figure -- when you factor in illegal recycling operations in the developing world -- is likely to be much, much higher. The United Nations believes, for example, that as many as 10 million people in China alone are now in the recycling business. What's not to like about recycling? There are some fairly persuasive arguments for recycling, and for using recycled goods. Energy savings is just one of them. By reusing existing materials you are essentially removing the process involved in sourcing the ""virgin materials"" in the first place. Take soda cans, made from aluminum. According to Friends of the Earth, creating a ton of these from scratch takes five times the amount of energy as it would to produce a ton of recycled cans. According to the Bureau of International Recycling (BIR), the companies that manufacture recycled aluminum are using 95 percent less energy than if they were using ""virgin materials."" (For plastics the energy savings are almost as high -- 80 percent, BIR says, while making paper from recycled paper (as opposed to wood) can save 64 percent of energy.) Looking at it another way, according to the National Recycling Coalition, the amount of energy saved in one year by Americans recycling their soda cans, plastic containers, newspapers and packaging represented the energy equivalent of: . Not surprisingly, recycling also impacts pollution levels. BIR says producing paper from recycled paper as opposed to wood can slash air pollution by as much as 74 percent and water pollution by 35 percent; while manufacturing recycled steel results in 86 percent less air pollution. There are different types of pollution savings to be made, reducing the pollution generated by manufacturing the stuff in the first place. And then there is the pollution that results in dumping the waste in landfills, instead of recycling it. A recent report from the European Environment Agency (EEA), for example, has predicted that greenhouse gas emissions from household waste will drop by more than 80 percent by 2020 -- largely because of increases in recycling levels which are diverting waste away from landfills. And the carbon savings can be huge, even when a relatively small amount of effort has been made. The UK has one of Europe's lowest recycling rates when it comes to municipal waste -- 27 percent. Yet, the impact on its carbon emissions has already become worthwhile, according to Waste & Resources Action Programme, or WRAP. WRAP says that these relatively minor efforts already mean a 10 million- to 15 million-ton reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions a year -- the equivalent of taking 3.5 million cars off the road. What about the costs? One of the main objections to the recycling movement has been the cost factor. Throwing something away is obviously going to be a lot cheaper than going through the hassle of recycling it. And certain materials are going to be a lot tougher to recycle than others, driving up costs and energy spent. But, as a 2004 study by research group GPI Atlantic found out, there are many different ways to measure cost. GPI looked at the Canadian province of Nova Scotia, which back in the 1990s had decided that 50 percent of its trash was going to get recycled instead of landing up in incinerators or landfills. The annual cost to the province of doing this was $18 million more than it would have cost to chuck trash away. But, when different factors were considered, the number looked very different These factors included: . GPI concluded that Nova Scotia was in fact saving up to $125 million simply because it had embraced recycling. The developing world's gain? Arguably, recycling has seen the most economic success in the poorer parts of the world. According to the Earth Institute, the aluminum can recycling business in Brazil now employs more people than its car industry. Brazilians collecting used soda cans have boosted their earning power significantly, earning $200 a month against the standard minimum $81 monthly salary. Then there are the inhabitants of a single 174-hectare slum in India's largest city, Mumbai, that have managed to create a $1.3 billion recycling industry between them, according to the Observer. Dharavi is home to one million slum dwellers, with a quarter of them fully employed (albeit often illegally) in a recycling business which processes 80 percent of Mumbai's plastic waste alone. ""There is a lot to be learned from the developing world,"" the Observer quoted Friends of the Earth's Claire Wilton as saying. ""Where a scavenger mentality, grassroots recycling and sheer necessity can lead to imaginative leaps in redeploying waste."" That being said, the economic impact may be welcomed by those in poorer countries sifting through everyone's trash -- but the health impact still leaves a lot to be desired. Around 70 percent of the world's electronic waste ends up in southern China. A recent study by Hong Kong's Baptist University found that the basic methods employed to recycle these items was having an unsettling effect on people living nearby, specifically women. Women in their mid-20s in one recycling site in Zheijiang Province were found to be carrying the highest levels of cancer-causing toxic chemicals like dioxins and furans than they had seen anywhere else in the world. It is still too early to say what the long-term effects of these chemicals will be on these women, but it is likely that it will become clear when they attempt to have children. Dioxins and furans have been linked to reproductive problems specifically. The researchers found that the women had twice the amount of dioxins in their breast milk and three times as much in their placentas as normal. They were also found to be at increasing risk of experiencing spontaneous abortions the longer they chose to live there.  E-mail to a friend .

"CARACAS, Venezuela (CNN) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez called Friday for Europe to remove from its list of terrorist organizations two Colombian groups -- including FARC, the group that freed two hostages Thursday in a mission Chavez organized. During his televised State of the Union speech, Chavez -- an outspoken enemy of the Bush administration -- insisted Europe includes the two groups on its terror list only because of ""pressure"" from the United States, which also names them on its list of foreign terrorist organizations. ""I request from the governments of the continent that they will remove the FARC and the ELN,"" Chavez said. FARC, the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, has been blamed for numerous attacks and holds about 750 hostages, according to Colombian government estimates. ELN, the National Liberation Army, the second-largest rebel group in Colombia, also is blamed for killings, kidnappings, and other attacks. This week the Colombian government announced the capture of Carlos Marin Guarin, known by the alias ""Pablito,"" alleged to have commanded roughly half the ELN force. Both FARC and ELN are on the European Union's list of groups and individuals believed linked to terrorism. ""I will ask Europe to remove the ELN and the FARC from the list of terrorist groups in the world, because that only has one source: the pressure of the United States,"" Chavez said. He argued, ""I say this even though somebody might be bothered by it: the FARC and the ELN are not terrorist groups. They are armies, real armies ... that occupy a space in Colombia."" He added that the two groups' ""insurgent forces"" have a goal, ""a project,"" that is ""Bolivarian"" and that ""we respect."" Chavez said his nation is committed to bringing about peace in Colombia, a task that means ""we must continue to work at the various levels"" with FARC and ELN. ""No one should be bothered by it. It is absolutely essential to do so. Who can think of the possibility of a peace accord when there is no contact with the parties involved,"" he asked.

"Washington (CNN) -- Several veterans and conservative bloggers are taking issue with President Barack Obama choosing not to attend the Memorial Day ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery. Vice President Joe Biden is attending in his place. ""Arlington is a place of tremendous symbolism,"" said Paul Rieckhoff, founder of the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. ""On Monday, it's where the eyes of our entire nation will be focused,"" said Rieckhoff, ""and unfortunately, the president and his family won't be there to stand with us."" After his Friday trip to the Louisiana coast to check on the oil spill, the president will go to Chicago, Illinois, with his family to spend time with friends. Obama will mark the Monday holiday with remarks at the Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery, about an hour outside of Chicago. ""President Obama has a deep respect and appreciation for our service members and veterans, clearly seen in his administration's policies, priorities and actions,"" said Nick Shapiro, White House assistant press secretary. A conservative blogger disagrees. On Redstate.com, Erick Erickson writes, ""going to Arlington National Cemetery to lay a wreath at the tomb of the unknowns has ... everything to do with a Commander in Chief who seems to not like the military showing some basic respect to the men and women, alive and dead, who have actually kept us free."" Erickson is also an analyst for CNN. But some vets groups say it's all right if the president misses this one, noting that he attended wreath-laying ceremonies at Arlington last year. Jay Agg, communications director for AMVETS, a veterans service organization, said ""this really is a nonissue,"" calling a lot of the outrage ""politically motivated."" ""It really does seem odd to me that such a big deal is being made out of this because he is going to a national cemetery to observe the holiday in Illinois. Bush sent Cheney to a Veterans Day event in DC,"" Agg said. Obama's absence from Memorial Day services at Arlington will not be unprecedented, but in recent years, it has been a common practice to attend. President Bill Clinton went every year of his presidency, and President George W. Bush went each year except for the year he was in Europe to commemorate the D-Day anniversary. Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush did not attend regularly. ""AMVETS recognizes and appreciates the fact that the president has done a lot for veterans,"" Agg said. ""He's behind the largest increase to the VA budget in history and has signed a number of critical pieces of legislation that benefit vets, including the post-9/11 GI bill, and more recently, caregiver legislation,"" he said. ""We're in middle of two wars,"" argues Rieckhoff, of the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. ""There will be hundreds of children there who have lost parents. Every major veterans group will be there. He should be there with his family."" ""We understand that President Obama is a very busy man. He has things like the oil spill and the economy to worry about,"" American Legion spokesman Marty Callaghan told CNN. ""Obviously, it is always a good thing for our commander in chief to be in the nation's capital for Memorial Day,"" he said. ""But other presidents have not always been here, including the first President Bush and President Reagan."" ""We feel like he is going to be here in spirit,"" Callaghan said. ""He is our commander in chief.""","Obama to mark holiday at Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery outside Chicago .

"(CNN)  -- In his West Virginia home, Peter Ruplenas, a three-time war veteran spends his days thumbing through his personal photography collection. His compilation is vast and includes countless photographs of B-24 bombers, soldiers in the field and the aftermath of war. He holds up a photograph of himself taken by fellow photographer Dick Durrance during the Vietnam War. In it, Ruplenas trudges through a rice paddy after returning from a sweep in Cu Chi, Vietnam. He struggles to carry all his gear, but his grip is firm on his 35-millimeter camera. The photograph captures Ruplenas at the peak of his 29-year photography career and brings him back to a time when he says he was fearless. ""The minute I took the first picture I was completely relaxed."" ""I feel pretty proud of what I've done,"" says Ruplenas, a 91-year-old retired combat cameraman of World War II, Korea and Vietnam. How you can honor fallen U.S. troops . He joined the Army in 1941 and within weeks of lacing up his boots, became a combat photographer. Combat photographers have long-served a tactical and strategic purpose -- their primary objective is to gather military intelligence. While some, like Matthew Brady and Robert Capa, have had storied careers, thousands of others worked in obscurity, their identity hidden behind the lens. Veteran Navy combat photographer Johnny Bivera says military photographers provide a valuable legacy. People like Ruplenas provide our society ""with documentation about a time and place in our history that has long changed and moved on."" Ruplenas recalls the nervousness he felt on D-Day in World War II, one of his first assignments. ""I hitched up a ride and a pilot let me go with him, I photographed the dozens and dozens of landing craft going in shore. We didn't drop one bomb because our targets in France were covered by fog and rain."" His company commanders soon realized his talent and encouraged him to take more photographs. Army Headquarters began reviewing his shots regularly to determine whether the United States had hit their hopeful targets. ""I love photography,"" says Ruplenas. ""Anytime they had accidents, disasters, bombings, I flew out and photographed it."" How to help families of wounded U.S. troops . Despite his deep appreciation for the job, he says the Korean War was the most difficult to cover. In addition to frostbite and seven days behind enemy lines with an all Korean guerilla group, he says it was the weather that proved to be most trying. ""It went from 60 to 70 degrees when we first landed to 32 below. I worked day in and day out, hardly any days off because I loved my job."" Throughout his photography career, Ruplenas mentored younger soldiers as they trained in his shadow. He did not like to get overly technical about photography. ""If anyone walked up to me and asked a technical question, I'd say ask the next guy,"" he says, laughing. But, says Ruplenas, ""I could tell you the best angle and the best way to get those photographs."" He says the best part of the job was photographing young American GIs and feels privileged to have had encounters with movie stars like Bob Hope, Tony Bennett and Patti Page during his military travels. Ruplenas has also encountered younger veterans in recent years who remember his work and credit him with helping them find a profession in photography. ""It makes you feel pretty good,"" he says. Ruplenas retired from the Army in 1970 and says he now enjoys spending time with his granddaughter and seven adopted alley cats. He also loves going through his collection of photographs. ""When you hit 91 years old and you've gone through three wars, you ought to ... just relax."" And while he doesn't photograph as much as he used to, Ruplenas insists, ""without a camera, I'm nothing.""","Peter Ruplenas is a retired combat cameraman of WWII, Korea and Vietnam .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Alicia Keys has 12 Grammys under her belt and now she has something else under there, too. The 29-year-old R&B singer is pregnant with her first child, her representatives confirmed. They would not say when the child is due. Weeks of photos have shown Keys noticeably fuller in the mid-section and sporting a collection of loose-fitting black tops. The father is Keys' fiance, producer/DJ/rapper Swizz Beatz. The couple is engaged to be married in a private ceremony later this year. Swizz Beatz, 31, -- whose real name is Kasseem Dean -- has one son from his marriage to Mashonda Tifrere. He also has a second son from a previous relationship. Swizz Beatz and Keys have been friends for several years and worked together on one song for her current album, ""The Element of Freedom,"" the publicist said.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- A new study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found that infants born as a result of assisted reproductive technology, or ART -- such as in vitro fertilization and the use of donor eggs -- are two to four times more likely to be born with certain types of birth defects than infants conceived naturally. But, the study's lead author says, the overall risk is still relatively low. With any pregnancy, there is a 3 percent risk of having a baby with a birth defect. ""The most important findings were that for infants conceived using ART, we see an increased risk for certain birth defects,"" said Jennita Reefhuis, Ph.D., an epidemiologist at the CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities. She says that children conceived using ART were found to have twice the risk of septal heart defects (a ""hole"" in the heart), more than twice the risk of cleft lip with or without cleft palate, and four times the risk of two gastrointestinal defects. As part of the National Birth Defects Prevention Study, which gathers information on birth defects from 10 states, Reefhuis and her colleagues compared 281 births using ART with more than 14,000 naturally conceived births. The researchers looked at approximately 18 categories of birth defects, but only those four were found to be ""statistically significantly associated with ART."" The study findings pertain only to single births; the researchers did not find a link between ART and birth defects among multiple births. ART increases the chances of having a multiple birth, and infants born as part of a multiple birth are more likely to have birth defects regardless of the method of conception. ""It is important for parents to realize that the individual risk for these birth defects remain low,"" Reefhuis said. ""It sounds like a lot to say 'a two- to fourfold increased risk,' but you have to keep in mind that the starting risk for these individual defects is actually pretty low."" Still, says Reefhuis, in the interest of full disclosure and because the use of ART is on the rise, it is important to make these higher risks known. ""I think it's important for people to be aware that there may be an increased risk for birth defects with ART,"" she said. ""But it is also really important for couples to realize that with any pregnancy, there is a 3 percent risk of a birth defect regardless of any exposures during pregnancy."" Elizabeth Ginsburg, M.D., president of the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technologies and the medical director of in vitro fertilization at Brigham and Women's hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, says the study adds to a growing body of evidence. Ginsburg is not connected to the CDC study. ""I think the take-home message is that if you have infertility and you are going to get help to try to conceive, there is some evidence that you might be at increased risk of having a baby with problems,"" Ginsburg said. ""The big question it raises is, is there something biologically different about people with infertility,"" Ginsburg said. ""It wouldn't be shocking to find out that there may be some biological difference that makes it more difficult for them to conceive as well as putting them at risk of a higher chance of having babies with some sort of adverse outcome."" ART, which has been used in the United States since 1981, is defined as any procedure that involves surgically removing eggs from a woman's ovaries, combining them with sperm in the laboratory, and returning them to the woman's body or donating them to another woman. It does not include intrauterine -- or artificial -- insemination or egg-stimulating drugs such as Clomid. It is estimated that more than 1 percent of babies born in the United States are conceived using ART, and that number has been steadily rising, with the rate doubling between 1996 and 2004. In 2005, 134,000 ART procedures were performed, resulting in approximately 52,000 births. Almost 12 percent of women ages 15 to 44 report having used some kind of infertility treatment, according to a 2002 national survey.","CDC: Babies born via fertility treatments are at higher risk of certain birth defects .

"Washington (CNN) -- The World Bank has canceled Haiti's $36 million debt, the institution announced Friday. Haiti owed the money to the International Development Association, the World Bank's fund for the poorest countries. The nation, wracked by a devastating earthquake on January 12, now does not owe any more money to the World Bank. ""Relieving Haiti's remaining debt is part of our effort to pursue every avenue to help Haiti's reconstruction efforts,"" World Bank Group President Robert B. Zoellick said in a release. ""We will continue to work in close cooperation with the Haitian government and our international partners to support the country's recovery and longer-term development."" The debt cancellation was made possible by contributions from Belgium, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland, the World Bank said. Since the earthquake, the World Bank has made $479 million available to Haiti to support recovery and development through June 2011. In addition, a broad array of international donors pledged nearly $10 billion in long-term assistance to Haiti's earthquake recovery efforts during a conference in March at United Nations headquarters. Last year, prior to the earthquake, Haiti obtained $1.2 billion in debt relief from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and other creditors. January's 7.0-magnitude earthquake killed more than 200,000 people and leveled large parts of Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital.","World Bank cancels Haiti's $36 million debt .

"(CNN Student News) -- May 27, 2010 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • Arizona • Seoul, South Korea • New York City . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Hi, there! My name is Carl Azuz. This is CNN Student News! This school year may be fleeting, but we've got 10 minutes to bring you today's commercial-free headlines. First Up: Border Security . AZUZ: First up, President Obama is sending troops and money to the border between the U.S. and Mexico. The announcement came out late Tuesday. 1,200 additional National Guard troops and $500 million more, all aimed at increasing border security and cutting down on illegal activities. The plan is for these troops to help out with drug enforcement and intelligence efforts until the Customs and Border Protection agency recruits and trains new agents to serve at the border. According to a new CNN poll, nearly nine out of every 10 Americans think more troops are needed along the border. Arizona's lawmakers agree. Their state is part of that border with Mexico, and some of them have been calling for more troops. One of those lawmakers, Senator John McCain, says the president's plan isn't enough though. He thinks it'll take 3,000 new troops, and that's just to cover the Arizona-Mexico border. As for Mexico, it says the additional forces will help out, but Mexican officials say they hope these troops will be fighting against crime and not getting involved in immigration laws. Gulf Coast Oil . AZUZ: Well tomorrow, President Obama is scheduled to visit the Gulf Coast to see how things are going in the fight against that giant oil spill we've been telling you about. Yesterday, the fight took a new turn. You've heard us talk about the so-called ""top kill"" procedure they're going to try. Around 2 p.m., BP started it. They started pumping 50,000 pounds of a special mud-like fluid that has about twice the density of water and they were pumping that into the leak. They hope -- we all hope -- it stops the oil. Then, the whole thing will be sealed off with cement. The head of BP said there was about a 60 to 70 percent chance of success. President Obama said if it works, it should seriously reduce or even stop the flow of oil. If it fails, the president says they'll move onto the next strategy. When we recorded this show yesterday, the process was still going on. We hope to have more details on it for you tomorrow. In the meantime, you can always get the latest details at CNN.com. Korean Tensions . AZUZ: Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is back in the U.S. after spending a week in Asia. Her last stop on that trip was South Korea. And as you've heard, things have been tense between that country and North Korea. If you haven't heard, you can watch our archived shows from this week to find out why. You will find those show at CNNStudentNews.com. Getting back to Secretary Clinton, she says the North is provoking the South. She calls it unacceptable and she's urging North Korea to stop making threats. She says the international community has a responsibility to respond to the situation, and she made it clear that the U.S. is standing behind South Korea. HILLARY CLINTON, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Let me repeat publicly what I expressed privately to President Lee and Minister Yu. The United States offers our deepest sympathies to the families and friends of the 46 sailors killed in the sinking of the Cheonan and to all the people of South Korea. We will stand with you in this difficult hour and we stand with you always. Shoutout . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Miss Poole's civics and economics class at Hobbton High School in Newton Grove, North Carolina! What is the term for a group of military ships? You know what to do! Is it: A) Battalion, B) Phalanx, C) Fleet or D) Conclave? You've got three seconds -- GO! A group of military ships is referred to as a fleet. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Fleet Week . AZUZ: And a celebration involving a group of military ships is called Fleet Week! It's taking place right now in New York City. Fleet Week is actually a celebration of all the military sea services: the Navy, the Marine Corps and the Coast Guard. They happen in different cities all over the country. New York has hosted a Fleet Week nearly every year since 1984. Thousands of sailors, Marine and Coast Guard members are in New York for the event. It kicks off with the Parade of Ships, which you see right here. Once they dock at the pier, people can go on board and take tours of the Navy vessels. Plus, there are dozens of military demonstrations throughout the week. Home and Away . AZUZ: Fleet Week runs through Memorial Day this weekend. Of course, Memorial Day, the holiday, pays tribute to all American troops who have lost their lives while serving the country in battle. CNN has a new website that does the same kind of thing. It's called ""Home and Away."" You see it on your screen right here. It's focused on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. More than 6,000 U.S. and coalition troops have been killed in these conflicts. The ""Home and Away"" site connects where these men and women died with where they lived, and it gives family members and friends an opportunity to share memories about their loved ones. You'll find a link to the site in the Spotlight section of our home page; that's CNNStudentNews.com. Is this Legit? STAN CASE, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit? The space shuttle Atlantis is named after the legendary lost city. Nope! The shuttle is named after a sailing ship that was run by an oceanographic institute. Last Landing for Atlantis? AZUZ: Atlantis came in for what could be its final landing yesterday. The space shuttle program is scheduled to end later on this year, and Atlantis is the first shuttle on the retirement list. It touched down at Kennedy Space Center after its 32nd mission. During that time, it helped with the international space station and launched spacecraft that explored Venus and Jupiter. Atlantis' service in space isn't necessarily over though. It's the back-up shuttle for a future mission if anything goes wrong, so NASA's getting the shuttle ready just in case. Once the shuttles do retire, they're not headed for the junk yard, and you can't really recycle them. John Zarrella thought looks at what could happen once the space shuttles are permanently grounded. (BEGIN VIDEO) JOHN ZARRELLA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: As they rocket to space, the astronauts watch the world fall away below them. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Getting RPM. Three, two, one, mark. ZARRELLA: Discovery does a somersault as it approaches the space station. Nearly 30 years of these ""oh wow"" moments almost over. The end of this year or sometime next, the last shuttle will fly. So, what do you do with three old orbiters? Heck, Atlantis has got 120 million miles on her. If you're NASA, you can't get all teary-eyed and nostalgic. You've got to unload those old clunkers and move on; put a for-sale sign on Atlantis and Discovery and Endeavour. So, you've got to build a building right here that would enclose the space shuttle for a bit. It's got to be a temperature-controlled building, right? BILL MOORE, KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, VISITOR COMPLEX: Has to be all up to artifact standards. But more than just the building for the shuttle, we have to tell the story. ZARRELLA: Bill Moore heads the privately-run Visitor Complex at the Kennedy Space Center. They are one of at least a dozen suitors ready, in fact eager, to fork over to NASA $28.8 million for an orbiter. ALLARD BEUTEL, NASA SPOKESMAN: We're not selling them, remember. This is what it's going to cost to get it cleaned up and make it safe to display and then to actually get it there. ZARRELLA: You've got almost $30 million ready to hand that check to NASA. MOORE: Between our cash and the loan arrangements, we could take the shuttle tomorrow and get ready to go. ZARRELLA: There is no real rush, space agency officials say, to announce who gets which one because the orbiters are still flying. NASA has offered Discovery, the oldest in the fleet, to the Smithsonian. Museum officials there told us questions about cost ""have not been resolved, although the museum is exploring options."" One orbiter option is the Big Apple. Folks at the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum say more people would see it here than anywhere else. They estimate a 30 percent increase in attendance. SUSAN MARENOFF, INTREPID SEA, AIR & SPACE MUSEUM: We figure over 300,000 people additional to the Intrepid to New York City. Couple that with the $106 million in economic benefits, we think that's a pretty good deal. ZARRELLA: Landing one of history's first space planes would certainly qualify as a pretty good deal. John Zarrella, CNN, at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. (END VIDEO) Before We Go . AZUZ: Before we go, why didn't the duck cross the road? 'Cause it was chicken! You would be too if you were trying to make it across rush hour traffic. Luckily -- don't be afraid -- someone spotted the junior jaywalkers and called the cops. The officers arrived, stopped traffic and escorted the fearful fowl across the highway. Youi see that taking place right here. It's cute. But it does raise a question though. When police officers are called in to help ducks... Goodbye . AZUZ: Who gets stuck with the bill? If that one didn't get you to quack up, we'll try again tomorrow.

"(CNN)  -- France has been chosen to host the 2016 European Football Championship. France beat off the challenge of Italy and Turkey to win the decision, which was made by the 13 members of the UEFA executive committee. UEFA president Michel Platini unveiled the name of France in a ceremony at its headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on Friday. It will be the third time the country has hosted the tournament, having previously staged it in 1960 and 1984. France won the competition in 1984, captained by Platini, and again in 2000. ""This is a beautiful day for us,"" French Football Federation president Jean-Pierre Escalettes told the official UEFA Web site. France also hosted the World Cup in 1938 and 1998. The bid was strongly supported by French president Nicolas Sarkozy, who spoke in the final round of bid presentations to the UEFA officials earlier in the day. Turkish president Abdullah Gul was in Geneva to back his country's bid, while Italy were represented by sports minister Rocco Crimi. The final decision was tight, with UEFA revealing that France beaten Turkey seven votes to six in the second round of voting after Italy had been eliminated. France will follow Ukraine and Poland, the co-hosts of Euro 2012, which is the last championship under the current format of 16 nations. The 2016 event will comprise 24 teams in the finals and will be extended by a further week to accommodate the extra matches. The French bid included 12 stadiums, four of which will be new, in 11 cities. The Stade de France where France beat Brazil in the 1998 World Cup final, Paris Saint Germain's Parc des Princes, Lens, Lille, Bordeaux, Nice, Toulouse, Marseille, Lyon, Strasbourg, Saint Etienne and Nancy are the proposed venues.","France wins right to host the 2016 European Football Championship .

"PADUCAH, Kentucky (CNN) -- Defense lawyers trying to save their client from the death penalty argued Tuesday that former U.S. soldier Steven Green exhibited clear symptoms of acute stress disorder in Iraq and that a military psychiatric nurse-practitioner failed to diagnose the troubled infantryman and pull him out of combat. Former U.S. soldier Steven Green has been convicted of raping and killing a 14-year-old Iraqi girl. Green was convicted last week in U.S. District Court in Kentucky of murder, rape, conspiracy and obstruction of justice. A jury found Green guilty of a raping a 14-year-old girl, then killing her and setting her body on fire to destroy evidence. Green also was found guilty of killing the girl's parents and 6-year-old sister. Green might become the first former U.S. soldier to face the death penalty for war crimes before a civilian court, where he was tried because he had been discharged from the military before his crimes came to light. Four other former soldiers are in prison for their roles in the crimes and the cover-up that followed. His lawyers offered testimony Tuesday from a psychiatrist who testified that a mental health review ""did not meet acceptable mental health standards."" Dr. Pablo Stewart testified that a military nurse-practitioner who examined Green some three months before the crimes ""had the answers in front of her that clearly marks all the symptoms of acute stress disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder."" Yet rather than pull Green out of combat or follow up with additional care, Stewart testified, the nurse-practitioner prescribed sleeping pills and sent Green back to his traffic checkpoint in an area known as the ""Triangle of Death,"" one of the bloodiest areas of the Sunni-led insurgency. Earlier, defense lawyers had identified the nurse practitioner as Lt. Col. Karen Marrs, and she was called by the defense to testify. She described Green's company as having the worst morale she'd ever seen, and she said the entire battalion was ""red,"" meaning it was ""mission incapable"" -- the troops were ""hostile, vengeful and needed increased control and command,"" without which there was a greater likelihood of misconduct. The psychiatric nurse said it was important for soldiers to return to duty, not only to keep up troop numbers, but also because ""soldiers evacuated prematurely have a hard time fitting in."" Marrs said procedures were followed, but it was difficult to keep precise records partly because soldier interviews took place under difficult conditions, in one case in a concrete structure that had a hole in the ceiling from a mortar shell. She said troops often were counseled that ""having sad and angry feelings are common,"" and that ""you aren't a monster for having these thoughts in monstrous conditions."" At the time of Green's arrest, he told FBI agents, ""You probably think I'm a monster."" Throughout the testimony Tuesday, Green repeatedly glanced at the jury. He appeared pale, wearing a light-blue button-down shirt and pressed khakis. He smiled at times while talking to his lawyers. He seemed moved by the testimony of his uncle, Greg Simolke, who broke down several times while speaking about his nephew.

"New York (CNN) -- The serendipitous occurrence of this year's Thanksgiving holiday on the same evening as the Muslim Eid-ul-Adha is a festive occasion to reflect on the place of Islam in American collective consciousness and on Muslims as Americans. On the same evening that millions of Americans gather around their Thanksgiving dinner to celebrate this most American of holidays, even more millions of Muslims around the globe, including the growing number of American Muslims, will do the same -- celebrating as well one of the most definitive moments of their faith -- Prophet Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son for his God. This holiday celebration comes soon after the tragic incident at Fort Hood, when the atrocious act of a mass murderer put Islam and Muslims under some pressure to either denounce or defend their faith. The psychotic act of Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, MD, a Muslim American military psychiatrist at Fort Hood who went on a rampage killing 13 U.S. soldiers and wounding 30 others, has prompted two diametrically opposed reactions. On one side are people who say that Islam -- and Islam alone -- is inherently violent and by extension Muslims are constitutionally driven to murder, while on the other are apologetic Muslims who argue their faith is peaceful and benevolent -- unrelated to criminal acts such as Hasan's. The fact is that Maj. Hasan and Osama bin Laden have as much claim on Islam as do Muhammad Ali, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and the Persian poet Mawlana Jalal al-Din Rumi, who is the best-selling poet in America. Islam is an abstraction and any Muslim, saintly or satanic, detested or beloved, can and does have a claim on it -- and Islam is not the only world religion with this proclivity for good and evil. The distinguished New York Times columnist David Brooks, one of the most consistently militant warriors in his take on American involvements in Afghanistan and Iraq, takes Islam -- and Islam alone -- to task for having a diabolic roughness on its fringes. But even if so, Islam is not alone in this failure to curtail murderous instincts. The same Hinduism that produced Mahatma Gandhi and his non-violent theory of civil disobedience has also produced Hindu fundamentalists who sliced and skewered pregnant Muslim women alive in Gujarat. The same Christianity that produced Saint Francis of Assisi and Mother Theresa also produced children's crusades and Spanish conquistadors who burned native Americans alive 13 at a time (according to the 16th-century Spanish Dominican priest, Bartolomé de las Casas) in honor of the Twelve Apostles and Jesus Christ. It also produced American Seung-Hui Cho who killed 32 students and himself at Virginia Tech and American John Wayne Gacy, Jr., who raped and murdered 33 young men and boys in Chicago, Illinois, in the 1970s. The same Judaism that produced Martin Buber, Emanuel Levinas, or Primo Levi also produced the Stern Gang, Meir Kahane and Baruch Goldstein. But the knee jerk reaction of blaming Islam and Muslims, in general, or looking for delusional links to ""al Qaeda,"" for the horrific murders at Fort Hood points to something far more fundamental, overdue, and urgent -- namely something of a psychological barrier for Americans to accept the Islamic component of their own society, culture, and history. To avoid singling out Islam as diabolical, it is imperative for Americans to come to terms with the collectively repressed fact that by far the most important social uprising of their 20th century -- namely the civil rights movement of the 1960s -- is not as exclusively a Christian phenomenon as it is made out to be: The towering figure of a Muslim revolutionary named Malcolm X is of great importance in the history of that movement. It took a whole generation of Americans to accept the fact that Jewish civil rights activists were instrumental in many measures of the success that was achieved in the 1960s. It is long overdue for Americans also to recognize that Malcolm X was equally, if not more, important to the civil rights movement. The way the history of the civil rights movement is mostly remembered now, an overwhelming role is assigned to the Southern Baptist genealogy of Martin Luther King Jr. Malcolm X is delegated to a radical fringe -- portrayed as more of a menace and a hindrance than a positive force in the civil rights movement. But without the simultaneous presence of Malcolm X as a Muslim revolutionary, the Southern Baptist pacifism of Martin Luther King Jr. would not have been as formidable a force. Malcolm X and Martin Luther King were the yin and yang of the civil rights movement -- ennobling anger and vision coming together in hopes of realizing the dream of equality. For more than three decades now, I have taught generations of American students who come to college having scarce read a word about Malcolm X, and yet everything about Martin Luther King Jr. Until Americans come to terms with the fact that they are deeply indebted to a Muslim revolutionary for the fruits of the civil rights movement they enjoy today, Islam and Muslims will continue to be seen as archetypically alien and an everlasting danger to American lives and liberties. Americans are Christians, Jews, Hindus, agnostics, atheists, and anything else in between -- but Americans are also Muslims, millions of them, and Islam has now become integral to what the distinguished American sociologist Robert Bellah termed our ""civil religion."" It is only apt that this particular Thanksgiving, Americans think about Eid-ul-Adha, as precious to Muslim-Americans as the occasion that has gathered us all ""at the table."" Let's make room for Muslims ""at the table"" because -- to quote Langston Hughes -- they ""too, sing America."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Hamid Dabashi.","U.S. Muslims celebrate Thanksgiving and an important religious occasion on same day .

"(CNN) -- Security forces were burning the bodies of the dead this week in a Jamaican neighborhood ravaged by a failed attempt to arrest a suspected drug kingpin, according to residents, who said their entire neighborhood had been a war zone. Kingston's deputy police commissioner, Glenmore Hinds, denied the reports. ""We have no evidence of any body been burned,"" Hinds said Thursday. ""There is absolutely no evidence to suggest that any of the bodies been burned."" Jamaican authorities launched an all-out attempt to arrest Christopher ""Dudus"" Coke over the weekend, but they were met by barricades and gunfire that resulted in at least 67 deaths and the arrests of hundreds, mostly on weapons charges. ""Our best information is that he has not been arrested,"" Hinds said. ""His whereabouts, I cannot tell you."" Throughout the week, a discrepancy between the government's body count and that of local media raised eyebrows. Some residents of Tivoli Gardens, where much of the violence was focused, told CNN they fear the authorities are trying to cover up its extent. None of the residents who spoke with CNN would agree to use their names, fearing reprisal from the authorities. One man told CNN on Wednesday he could see the burning from his window, which overlooks the front of the public works compound. ""I literally saw them wrap up men in sheets and put tires on them and burn them,"" one man told CNN. The men were already dead, he said. He said he was shocked by what he'd seen. ""Never known Jamaica would become like this,"" he said, adding that he'd seen soldiers searching houses to see who lives where and taking men and women outside to separate places. When the shooting started, he said he hid under his bed. ""We are decent people living here, and they are shooting everywhere,"" he said. Another resident called the violence a ""war"" and said she saw teenage boys picking up bodies. ""And they are not finished yet,"" she said. ""They say they have more bodies to collect. ... 70 maybe."" ""Some of the bodies"" -- maybe 5 or 6 -- ""were burnt up"" by police, she said. By Wednesday, she said, ""War done. Nobody is here, just women, old people and little youths."" Another man described police dragging people from their homes and beating them. ""Happened to me, too,"" said the Tivoli Gardens resident, who has since fled to another neighborhood. ""Kick me down in the gully and made dirty water enter my mouth. I am traumatized."" ""Whole heap of people dead,"" he said. ""They are burning some bodies and sending the rest away, don't know what they do with the rest. They are cleaning up. ... The police and military man. No war is going on in Tivoli, it's just them alone. They are in there, in house on rooftops. They are cleaning up. They move all the sandbags and making it look like something else. The whole place mash up."" He guessed he had seen 100 to 150 bodies, but couldn't say for sure because of ""the way they were stacked up, nuff people dead. They are running them out in white vans, covering bodies in white sheets."" All three residents said Tivoli Gardens is in ruins. Journalists reported being unable to get into the shattered neighborhood at the beginning of the week, but on Thursday, security forces whisked reporters through an area of Tivoli Gardens they said was under government control. There, the neighborhood was quiet but the buildings were pocked with bullet holes and the streets littered with the remains of barricades. The tour was fast, officials said, because the area remained volatile. Hinds said Thursday that 73 bodies had been recovered from the battle sites, but six, he said, may not have died from the violence. All, he said, were civilians. ""But civilians are sometimes gunmen and gunwomen,"" he said. CNN's Christine Theodorou, Ben Brumfield, Rafael Romo and Nadine Drummond contributed to this report.","Officials deny any bodies have been burned .

"New York (CNN) -- His was the first face of a missing child to appear on the back of a milk carton. Now, nearly 31 years to the day since Etan Patz vanished from a New York street, authorities are reopening his case. The communications director for Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. confirmed that the office is taking another look at the decades-old mystery. ""It's a case that the district attorney has been aware of since before running for office last year,"" said Erin Duggan. ""Last summer he said he would take a fresh look at the case if he became district attorney. Tuesday he confirmed that the case had been reopened."" Duggan added, ""This was the disappearance of a child that gripped the residents of Manhattan and continues to leave many questions unanswered."" Etan was 6 when he disappeared on the morning of May 25, 1979. ""It was the first day that he was to walk two blocks from his apartment to the school bus stop,"" said Lisa R. Cohen, author of ""After Etan: The Missing Child Case That Held America Captive."" ""He had been wanting to do it by himself, and they gave him permission, literally two short blocks,"" Cohen said. ""And his mother could see the bus stop at the end of the street and she saw parents there, waiting with kids for the bus, and so she let him go."" Etan was never seen alive again. Jose Antonio Ramos, a convicted child molester, has been identified as a suspect in the disappearance, but has never been charged in connection with the case. According to Cohen, Ramos initially told investigators that he was ""90 percent sure"" that a boy he had taken home on that day in 1979 was Etan. Ramos has since denied making that statement, she said. Cohen said Etan's father, Stan Patz, contacted her after the news was announced that the prosecutor was reopening the case. ""He said, 'Maybe we'll finally get our day court,'"" she said. From families and detectives to people in the missing children movement, this case changed everything, Cohen said. ""Before Etan, parents did not have an image in their mind that something could happen to their children,"" she said. ""And after Etan, they did.""","Etan Patz was first missing child whose picture was put on a milk carton .

"(CNN) -- The mayor of Gary, Indiana, and Michael Jackson's father, Joe, on Wednesday will announce ""a major move forward"" to bring a museum and performance arts center bearing the singer's name to the city. Mayor Rudy Clay has said the project has the potential to bring 500,000 to 750,000 visitors to Gary and an annual income of $100 million to $150 million dollars to the community. In addition, the Jackson Family Museum and a Michael Jackson Performing Arts Center will generate hundreds of construction jobs and thousands of full-time jobs for the community when the project is completed, the mayor said in a press release. Joe and Katherine Jackson started their large family in a two-bedroom house in a working-class neighborhood in Gary. All 10 Jackson children were born in Gary between 1950 and 1966, including one who was stillborn. The Jacksons moved from Gary to Los Angeles, California, in 1971 amid the success of the Jackson 5 group, which featured Michael Jackson and four older brothers. Their home at 2300 Jackson Street is still a shrine for the occasional tourist. Jackson died on June 25, 2009.","Joe Jackson and Gary, Indiana, mayor pushing for Jackson tourist site .

"Washington (CNN) -- The failure of General Electric engines on four jet aircraft overseas during the past two years has prompted the National Transportation Safety Board to issue an ""urgent"" recommendation to increase inspections of the engines on U.S. aircraft. None of the incidents resulted in crashes, injuries or fatalities. But in all four cases, engine parts penetrated the engine housing. Such ""uncontained engine failures"" are particularly dangerous because flying engine parts could puncture fuel or hydraulic lines, damage flight surfaces or even penetrate the fuselage and injure passengers. At issue are General Electric CF6-45/50 series jet engines, older engines found on a small number of jets. FAA officials said 373 of the engines are in service in the United States, on a fewer, but unknown, number of planes. The engines are used on some Airbus A300s, Boeing 747s, DC-10s, MD-10s and U.S. Air Force KC-10s. A GE spokeswoman said most of the engines are used on cargo planes. On four occasions, the NTSB said, a rotor imbalance caused rotor disks to fail, leading to the uncontained engine failures. FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown said the FAA is aware of the problem and issued a rule in March requiring inspections of the engines within 50 flights, and repeat inspections every 175 flights thereafter. It also is working on a rule that would add testing of the rotor disks for cracks. But on Thursday, the NTSB issued its urgent recommendation, saying the FAA should require inspections every 15 flights until the disks can be replaced with improved parts. The FAA said the action ""will maintain the safety of the fleet,"" and that it will decide whether to alter the inspection schedule after completing examinations of the engines involved in the recent incidents. GE spokeswoman Deborah Case said GE issued a service bulletin last August advising operators to inspect and monitor the engines. The NTSB recommendation follows these four incidents: . -- July 4, 2008: A Saudi Arabian Airlines (Saudia) Boeing 747-300 experienced an engine failure after takeoff from Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. -- March 26, 2009: An Arrow Cargo McDonnell Douglas DC-10F, about 30 minutes after takeoff from Manaus, Brazil, experienced loss of oil pressure in one engine. The pilots shut down the engine and diverted to Medellin, Colombia. -- December 17, 2009: A Jett8 Airlines Cargo Boeing 747-200F was passing through 7,000 feet when the crew members heard a muffled explosion. With one engine losing oil pressure, the airplane returned to land at Changi, Singapore. -- April 10, 2010: An ACT Cargo Airbus A300B4 experienced an engine failure while accelerating for takeoff at Manama, Bahrain. The crew declared an emergency, aborted the takeoff, activated the fire-suppression system, and evacuated the airplane. The NTSB is participating in or leading investigations of the four incidents.","Engines on four jet aircraft overseas failed during the past two years .

"TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- Anti-whaling protesters hurled containers of butyric acid at a Japanese whaling ship in Antarctic waters, injuring four crew members, a Japanese official said Monday. Activists from the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society hurl objects on to the Japanese ship Nisshin Maru. The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society acknowledged the Sunday incident, saying it had lobbed more than two dozen bottles of rotten butter at the Nisshin Maru, ""sending a stench throughout the whale killing ship that will remain for days."" Butyric acid is found in rotten butter. The Sea Shepherd boat had to move a half-mile away from the whaling ship because ""it stinks too bad to remain any closer,"" activist Todd Emko of New York said in a statement from the group.  Watch protesters toss objects at the ship » . The conservation group said it also threw packets of a slippery chemical on to the deck of the ship, making it difficult to cut up whales. The unnamed substance becomes more slippery when mixed with water so it will be difficult to wash off the deck, a Sea Shepherd statement said. ""I guess we can call this nonviolent chemical warfare,"" said Capt. Paul Watson of the Sea Shepherd boat, the Steve Irwin. ""We only use organic, nontoxic materials designed to harass and obstruct ... whaling operations."" Itsunori Onodera, Japan's senior vice minister for foreign affairs, described the incident at an international seminar for African and Asian delegates to the International Whaling Commission. He said the Sea Shepherd group threw bags of acid, rather than bottles of rancid butter. Onodera told the audience that the crew complained of injuries afterward, but he didn't elaborate. Sea Shepherd's U.S. office said it did not know of any injuries. Sea Shepherd interferes with Japanese hunts in an attempt to reduce the number of whales taken. In January, two activists from the group were seized when they boarded another Japanese whaling ship. Japan is lobbying a dozen members of the International Whaling Commission in Tokyo to support its much-criticized Antarctic whaling program. The effort comes before all 78 members of the panel this week in London, England. The commission is meeting to discuss reaching an agreement on whale conservation rules. Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its Fisheries Agency are making their case to officials from Angola, Eritrea, the Republic of the Congo, Guinea, Ghana, Malawi, Tanzania, Palau, Micronesia, Cambodia, Laos and Vanuatu. Japan has said it is conducting the hunt as research, calling the practice environmentally and scientifically sound.  Watch why Tokyo is furious over the stink between whalers, protesters » . The country's annual hunt kills up to 1,000 whales a year; the Fisheries Agency insists it wants ""sustainable whaling."" However, many in the international community -- particularly Australia -- say such hunts amount to needless slaughter. Critics have said calling these hunts research is a pretext for retrieving whale meat to be sold in markets and restaurants.

I'm not sure what's more impressive: How well he knows his way around an iPad, or how entertaining his magic tricks are. Different versions of the YouTube video have already been viewed more than 700,000 times. It doesn't really matter that many of Shinya's tricks probably wouldn't be possible without long sleeves and quick hands -- at one point he takes too long to pull a piece of cheese out of his sleeve. He redeems himself twice over when he makes a live dove appear in his hand moments after showing a video of it on the iPad screen. Another highpoint of Shinya's act is when he pretends to pour a glass of milk onto his iPad. Despite the fact that the contents of the glass are clearly staying put, it appears as though the milk has filled the virtual glass on the screen. Is this really magic? Probably not, but it looks pretty darn cool. Another cool, yet subtle, part of the video is when Shinya covers his face with the iPad. His moving face appears on the screen, but he's wearing glasses.

"(CNN) -- A Gulf Coast official accused BP of shipping workers into Grand Isle, Louisiana, for President Barack Obama's visit to the oil-stricken area Friday and sending them away once the president left the region. Early Friday morning, ""a number of buses brought in approximately 300 to 400 workers that had been recruited all week,"" Jefferson Parish Councilman Chris Roberts told CNN's ""Situation Room."" Roberts said the workers were offered $12 an hour to come out to the scene at Grand Isle and work in what he called a ""dog and pony show."" But, when Obama departed, so did the workers, he said, adding that he's never seen more than 20 workers at the Grand Isle cleanup site since the effort started. BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles downplayed the claim Friday evening, telling CNN it is not unusual to see people wrapping up work in the afternoon. ""These individuals are working out in the heat of the sun. These are long days. They start early in the morning and they stop early in the evening,"" he said. ""So the fact that they were leaving the location late in the afternoon was not unusual. It's not associated with the president arriving."" Suttles added that the workers would be back Saturday morning to continue working. The company hired to provide the cleanup workers told WWL, a New Orleans-based radio station, that it was told to beef up the cleaning work force five days ago. ""No, I did not put extra workers on the job because the president was coming,"" said Donald Nalty of Environmental Safety and Health, which was contracted by BP to help in the cleanup effort. An official at the oil cleanup command center told CNN that a temporary busing system had been established to shuttle the growing number of workers because of limited parking and housing accommodations in areas most impacted by the spilled oil. The official said trained responders were putting in 12 to 14-hour days. Roberts told CNN's Anderson Cooper the hundreds of workers who showed up early Friday wouldn't speak to local emergency management officials. ""The sheriff's office did manage to get one person to speak with them and that individual said they were hired yesterday and told to report to a staging area at 7:30 this morning,"" Roberts added. ""It just doesn't add up.""","NEW: Company hired to provide cleanup crews says it got order to beef up 5 days ago .

"Robert, Louisiana (CNN) -- Three attempts to pump mud and 16 tries to stuff solid material into a breached Gulf of Mexico oil well failed to stop the flow, top BP executives said Saturday, and engineers and executives with the oil giant have decided to ""move on to the next option."" That option: Place a custom-built cap to fit over the ""lower marine riser package,"" BP chief operation officer Doug Suttles said. BP crews were already at work Saturday to ready the materials for that option, he said. Suttles said three separate pumping efforts and 30,000 barrels of mud -- along with what chief executive officer Tony Hayward described as ""16 different bridging material shots"" -- just didn't do the trick. ""We have not been able to stop the flow,"" a somber Suttles told reporters. "" ... Repeated pumping, we don't believe, will achieve success, so we will move on to the next option."" Suttles and other officials said that the ""top kill"" attempt to stop the flow did so -- but only as long as they were pumping. When the pumping stopped, the oil resumed its escape. And Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry said that BP would resume using undersea dispersants for the new attempt to trap the oil. Suttles said the lower marine riser package cap ""should be able to capture most of the oil"" that has fed what is now the largest oil spill in U.S. history, but he cautioned that the new cap will not provide a ""tight mechanical seal."" ""We're confident the job will work, but obviously we cannot guarantee success at this time,"" he said. Engineers should be ready in about four to seven days to make the fresh attempt, he said. Landry said officials were ""disappointed in today's announcement,"" but noted that the immediate efforts to stop the flow were never intended to be permanent. ""The real solution, the end state, is a relief well,"" she said. BP currently is working on two relief wells, but they are not expected to be ready until August, Suttles said. Earlier, Suttles said that BP engineers would try to place a second blowout preventer -- the piece of equipment that failed when the Deepwater Horizon exploded on April 20 -- should the lower marine riser package fail. The failed blowout preventer is a 48-foot-tall, 450-ton apparatus that sits atop the well 5,000 feet underwater. Suttles and Landry praised the clean-up efforts, however, in light of the failure of the ""top kill"" attempt to stop the flow. ""It's a tribute to everybody that we only have 107 miles of shoreline oiled and only 32 acres of marsh,"" Landry said. Meanwhile, teams in Louisiana were working Saturday on a clean-up project aimed at protecting coastal marshes. Plaquemines Parish President Billy Nungesser has said that machines would suck oil out of marshes Saturday after crews determined where to deploy them. But Nungesser told CNN that BP needed to ""step up to the plate tonight to save our wetlands"" by using its might to create sand barriers to prevent the oil from moving into the marshes. ""BP needs to say it will pay to move those dredges and pump that sand berm,"" he said. ""We are gonna die a slow death if we don't get that berm. We've got to have that barrier island."" President Barack Obama, who toured the area Friday, said federal officials were prepared to authorize moving forward with ""a portion of"" an idea proposed by local officials, who want the Army Corps of Engineers to build a ""sand boom"" offshore to keep the water from getting into the fragile marshlands. But Nungesser said the marshes couldn't wait and that the effort needed to start immediately to save the Louisiana wetlands. Government scientists on Thursday said as many as 19,000 barrels (798,000 gallons) of oil were spewing into the ocean every day, making this disaster perhaps twice the size of the Exxon Valdez incident. Previously, BP officials and government scientists had said 5,000 barrels (210,000 gallons) of crude were flowing out daily. ""This is clearly an environmental catastrophe,"" Hayward said Friday. ""There's no two ways about it."" In an e-mail message sent out after the announcement Saturday, Hayward said he was ""disappointed that this operation didn't work."" ""The team executed the operation perfectly, and the technology worked without a single hitch,"" he said. ""We remain committed to doing everything we can to make this situation right."" Obama's visit to the region came under intense political pressure to take control of the situation. ""We want to stop the leak, we want to contain and clean up the oil and we want to help the people in this region return to their lives and livelihoods as soon as possible,"" the president told reporters. About 25 percent of the Gulf of Mexico exclusive economic zone has been put off limits, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and fishermen are worried the gushing oil will take a more serious toll than Hurricane Katrina did in 2005. ""Katrina was nothing but rain, water and wind. This is poison. It's gas,"" oysterman Arthur Etienne said.

"(CNN) -- Rust-colored oil washed ashore on barrier islands off Alabama and Mississippi on Tuesday, while more patches of crude offshore appeared to be moving toward those states' coasts, authorities reported. Researchers scrambled to clean up tar balls and puddles of oil from the beaches of Alabama's Dauphin Island, while a strip of oil about two miles long and three feet wide stretched along Petit Bois Island, about five miles away off Mississippi, Gov. Haley Barbour's office reported. It marked the first time oil has hit Mississippi's shores since the largest oil spill in U.S. history erupted in late April. And while tar balls associated with the Gulf spill had hit Dauphin Island, about 35 miles south of Mobile, in early May, residents said that Tuesday was the first time they had seen oil hitting the beach. Only part of the island's beaches have been lined with protective booms, with much of those barriers lined up near a protected wildlife area on the west end of the island. Annette Engel, a Louisiana State University researcher on Dauphin Island, said the oil is believed to be from BP's ruptured well off Louisiana. She predicted much more would be hitting the coast in coming days -- but vacationers remained on the beach, and some were still swimming in the blue-green waters as the cleanup continued. And researchers from the Dauphin Island Sea Lab spotted large patches of the reddish-brown ""weathered"" oil during a water-sampling expedition offshore Tuesday, said John Dindo, the laboratory's associate director. Dindo said the oil spots on the water ranged from the size of a half-dollar coin to 30 to 40 feet. A half-dozen boats could be seen skimming oil off the surface about 13 miles south of the island, he said. However, ""They were covering a very, very small spot in the ocean compared to what we saw,"" he said. The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration had warned earlier this week that the spreading slick from an undersea BP oil well was heading toward the Alabama and Mississippi coasts. Dindo said tides in the area are running east and winds have been out of the southwest, driving the oil toward beach towns on the eastern side of Mobile Bay. Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen said earlier Tuesday that authorities were investigating reports that the outer sheen of oil was reaching coastal waters off Mississippi and Alabama, but said those reports had not been confirmed. ""We've dispatched survey teams to see what the impact is out there, and to the extent that is required, we'll move resources that direction,"" Allen, the federal government's national incident commander, told reporters in New Orleans, Louisiana.

"(CNN)  -- Championship leader Mark Webber made it a hat-trick of pole positions as he dominated qualifying for the Turkish Grand Prix in Istanbul on Saturday. Webber lapped in one minute 26.295 seconds to occupy first place on the grid ahead of 2008 world champion Lewis Hamilton in his McLaren. Webber's Red Bull teammate Sebastian Vettel was third fastest, with reigning world champion Jenson Button fourth in the second McLaren. Australia's Webber will be chasing a hat-trick of race victories, after wins in Spain and Monaco, in Sunday's 58-lap race, hoping to pull clear of Vettel in the title race. The teammates are currently tied on 78 points, but Webber is ahead on race victories. He said that his team had finally got to grips with the Istanbul Park circuit in time for the crucial qualifying. ""It hasn't been the smoothest of weekends for us in terms of getting the running in. Getting ready for 'quali' things started to get a little bit better,"" he told the post-qualifying press conference. ""I was a little bit on the back foot going in to be honest, but I knew if I dug deep it could be OK. And it worked out for us. ""I'm a little bit more confident for tomorrow to be honest."" The Red Bull team have claimed all seven poles this season and will be looking to extend their lead in the constructors' championship. Mercedes pair Michael Schumacher, in fifth, and Nico Rosberg will share the third row, but it was another disappointing qualifying session for Ferrari in their 800th grand prix. Felipe Massa of Brazil qualified eighth but two-time world champion Fernando Alonso did not make the top 10 for the final session. The Spaniard made a mistake in Q2 and ended up 12th, the second straight time he has made a hash in qualifying after being forced to start from the pit lane in Monaco. Ferrari team principal Stefano Domenicali was not amused by their showing. ""For sure the performance in qualifying was not up to our standard. We don't know why -- and we need to understand. For sure we were expecting much more performance,"" he told AFP.","Mark Webber on pole for Sunday's Turkey Grand Prix in Istanbul .

"(Mental Floss) -- Watching the post parade at this weekend's Kentucky Derby will surely fill some of our heads with dreams of horse ownership. How did the julep-sipping folks acquire their prized horses? How much is buying a racehorse going to set you back? Are they sound investments? These are all tricky questions, but let's take a look at a few stories of horse sales that turned out to be winning lottery tickets...and a few that were more dud than stud. Mr. Prospector becomes a daddy again and again . In 1971, Mr. Prospector was a yearling that fetched $200,000 at auction. When he took to the track, he was good but not great; he won seven of 14 starts but only brought home $112,170 during his career. Still, in 1980 he sold for $20 million. What happened? It turns out ""Mr. P."" was a stud in every sense of the word. While his racing career might not have been the most distinguished, it's tough to argue with his results as a stud. He sired a winner of each of the Triple Crown races, and his grandchildren and great-grandchildren have been similarly speedy. His sons, grandsons, and great-grandsons have combined to win over 30 Triple Crown races and pull in around $100 million in earnings. Mr. P.'s Derby-winning son Fusaichi Pegasus fetched $60 million in 2000, and 18 years earlier, another son -- Belmont winner Conquistador Cielo -- sold for $36.4 million. Mental Floss: Did famous horses get their names? John Henry drives steel, wins cash . When John Henry, a yearling foaled in 1975, came up for bids at the Keeneland January Mixed Sale, he didn't generate much buzz. He had fairly mundane bloodlines, he wasn't particularly big, and he had a nasty temper -- he got his name from a tendency of smashing steel feed buckets. John Calloway bought the unheralded gelding for a modest $1,100 investment and hoped he could make a little cash back on the horse. How did it work out? By the time John Henry retired from racing, he was the top-earning gelding in history with over $6.5 million in career earnings. He won 25 graded stakes races and was racehorse of the decade for the 1980s. Not a shabby return on a $1,100 investment. The Green Monkey makes a monkey out of bidders . Unless you're a huge fan of the band America, you might not envision shelling out eight figures for a horse with no name. That's exactly what happened in a January 2006 auction at Calder Race Course, though. When the auctioneers brought a colt who was only known as ""number 153"" to the auction block, a fierce bidding war broke out. Buyers weren't afraid to open their wallets for a colt that was described as ""perfect,"" and when the hammer dropped the horse went for a record $16 million. The winning bidders quickly christened the colt The Green Monkey, and excitement to see how the horse would do in races began to build. After all, the colt had run an eighth of a mile in a blazing 9.8 seconds in pre-auction workouts, so anything was possible once he started racing. The buyers thought they were getting a Triple Crown threat. Instead they got the thoroughbred version of Ryan Leaf. The Green Monkey could never translate his workout speed into actual races, and in his career, he only managed one third-place finish in a measly three starts. In 2008, his owners retired him from racing to stand at stud. If his progeny enjoy the success that eluded the Green Monkey, he might make some of his substantial purchase price back. It will be tough, though; right now he only pulls in $5,000 as a stud fee. Mental Floss: 7 things to know about the Kentucky Derby . ...But he's in good company . The Green Monkey shouldn't feel too bad. The horses he took the ""most expensive colt"" record from didn't fare much better. Seattle Dancer set the yearling price record in 1985 when he went for a cool $13.1 million before going on to win $150,000 in his five career starts. Snaafi Dancer's sale in 1983 was the worst investment this side of Pets.com stock; the first yearling to break the $10 million price mark never raced -- and was infertile. Cigar comes up empty . Even casual sports fans may remember Cigar, the bay stallion who racked up an incredible 16 straight wins from 1994 to 1996. If Cigar had picked up just $187 more during his career, he would have become the first horse ever to break $10 million in race earnings. When the former Breeders' Cup Classic Champ came up for sale in 1998, there were more than a few breeders who wanted to get their hands on him. Cigar sold for $25 million and promptly went out to stud to recoup some of that cash. That's when breeders discovered a problem: the horse that some analysts called ""the second-best racehorse ever"" was infertile. Cigar's new owners got a record $25 million payout on an insurance policy that covered infertility, and the champion stallion is spending the autumn of his years at the Kentucky Horse Park's Hall of Champions.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- His life has never been easy. Born into poverty and war, his ears and tail were chopped off when he was just a few months old in preparation for dog-fighting. He escaped to find a better life, only to be trapped in lonely, sterile quarantine for six months. Bear plays for the first time out of quarantine after coming to Britain from Afghanistan. But all that changed Monday when Bear the dog stepped out of British quarantine and through the doors of a London animal shelter. ""He's absolutely a loving dog,"" said former British Royal Marine Paul ""Penny"" Farthing, who helped bring Bear to England. ""He just loves people. It's a good thing he was brought back to the U.K. when he was quite young, so he's never gone through having to fend for himself in the street and be made to dogfight."" An unknown soldier in Afghanistan first found Bear last year and brought him to a local Afghan animal shelter. The shelter wasn't able to care for Bear, so it contacted Farthing, who now runs a charity for stray and abandoned animals, primarily dogs from Afghanistan. Farthing's Nowzad Dogs is named for the Afghan town where he was based for a few months in 2006. He asked Mayhew International, an arm of London's Mayhew Animal Home, to help find Bear a new home. Mayhew International says Bear is one of the few dogs it has brought back to Britain. Usually it tries to find animals new homes within their own countries. ""Although Mayhew International does not encourage people to bring dogs to the U.K. from abroad as a general policy, we made an exception in this case as it was the perfect opportunity to highlight the plight of thousands of stray animals in Afghanistan,"" the organization said in a statement. Bear's story may be unique, but he is certainly not alone. Mayhew International, which works around the world to educate people about animal welfare, says there are countless dogs in Afghanistan that are homeless or trapped in a life of dogfighting -- an increasingly popular pastime in Afghanistan. ""Animal welfare is not looked so highly upon in Afghanistan,"" said Christopher Sainsbury, Mayhew's international projects officer. ""In war-torn areas, people tend to forget the animal welfare side of things. [We want to] make people aware that this is a key side of things that needs to be assessed, needs to be worked on."" Bear is a Koochi dog, a large breed common in Afghanistan, according to Dr. Mohammadzai Abduljalil, a Mayhew veterinarian from Afghanistan. While no one knows Bear's exact age, Abduljalil said they believe he is just about a year old. You wouldn't know it by Bear's size. He's already a large dog nearly 3 feet high with large paws to match. Stepping into the Mayhew play area Monday for the first time, Bear made sure to sniff every corner of the room and mark his territory a few times before settling in to play. He had a puppy's curiosity and quickly started playing fetch and tug-of-war with Farthing, wagging enthusiastically the small part of his tail which is left. Bear is lucky. He escaped a violent and uncertain future in Afghanistan.  Not so for many other dogs left behind. It is those dogs that Farthing hopes to help with his charity. ""They need someone to look after them, so why not me?"" Farthing said. It began when the Royal Marines arrived in the war-torn town of Now Zad, in Afghanistan's Helmand province, in October 2006. They found stray dogs wandering the streets, scavenging for food, dodging bullets and seeking shelter from the hot days and cold nights. Many were also being used for dogfighting, with their ears and tails docked to make the fights last longer and give their opponents less to bite. Farthing and other Marines began to feed and care for a few dogs that wandered into their camp. At first they had three dogs, but other strays soon figured out the camp was a source of food and shelter, and before long the Marines found themselves caring for seven dogs and 14 puppies. Time was running out, however. The Marines were due to leave Now Zad in February 2007 and knew they couldn't take the dogs with them. They looked for some way to make sure the dogs would be taken care of after they left. That's when Farthing first contacted Mayhew International. They put him in touch with a small shelter in northern Afghanistan that Mayhew had assisted since its inception, providing advice and veterinary support. The shelter offered to take the dogs on one condition: The Marines had to arrange for the dogs' transfer to Kabul, a difficult and dangerous three days' drive away. Finding a taxi willing to accept dogs was the first hurdle; the second was that the drivers refused to allow the dogs to be transported in Western-style cages, which would give away to the Taliban that the car was carrying foreigners. Instead, the dogs had to be tied with ropes, the Afghan way, and the puppies had to be stashed in small crates -- in this case, a bird cage. ""A lot was done on trust,"" Farthing told CNN. ""The Afghans did it as a favor to us. We paid for some of their fuel and their costs, but it was fantastic. It was them helping us out. They didn't have to do it. It shows that the people of Afghanistan and us, we can work together."" In the end, most of the dogs made it to Kabul, but not without casualties. Two were left behind for lack of room in the taxi, and two more escaped along the way when a car door was accidentally left open. Three of the largest puppies were stolen, probably for dog fighting. Three dogs and eleven puppies finally made it to the shelter, but nine of the puppies later died due to an outbreak of disease and shortage of vaccines. Sainsbury, of Mayhew International, says the story of the Now Zad dogs and of Bear shows their efforts can help animals, even if it's just one at a time. Mayhew International works with organizations already established in developing countries to plan mass sterilization drives that reduce the number of unwanted animals. They also train veterinary surgeons in modern neutering techniques that are quick and humane. ""The way that war makes looking after animal welfare harder is quite clear,"" Sainsbury said. ""Animal welfare gets forgotten and it becomes a back-burner because organizations ... that were working in those war-torn countries will probably be unable to operate any longer. They'll be unable to aid the populations of stray and community animals which would rely on their help originally."" Mayhew CEO Caroline Yates said staff have no idea how long it will take for Bear to find a new home. They hope the publicity surrounding his arrival in Britain will encourage people to think about adopting him. Yates said they hope to have him adopted within a month. Said Farthing, ""To be able to help just one [dog] is a reward in itself and a huge step to highlighting the undocumented suffering that animals in all war zones are subjected to.""","Bear the dog was born into poverty, had ears and tail chopped off for dogfighting .

"This Mother's Day, skip the flowers and forget the chocolate (unless it's dark)! Give your mom something she really needs -- the gift of good health. Do something good for mom this Mother's Day by getting her healthy food and investing in her wellness. No, you don't have to buy her a treadmill. There are many other things you can do to give your mom a boost in terms of her physical (or mental) well-being. Most moms will truly appreciate that your Mother's Day gift is aimed at keeping her happy, healthy, and in your life for a long time. In case you are drawing a blank, we came up with a list of healthy -- and relatively inexpensive -- gift ideas for every mom. 1. Give the gift of (your) time and support at the doctor's office. ""Offer to be your mom's health buddy,"" says Philadelphia-based women's health expert Dr. Marie Savard, author of several books, including Ask Dr. Marie: Straight Talk and Reassuring Answers to Your Most Private Questions. ""Promise to be there for any and all doctor's visits whether a mammogram or routine appointment,"" she said. ""Most moms always say 'don't bother,' but another set of eyes and ears is always a good idea at a doctor's visit."" The best part? This one is free. Health.com: A mammogram may have saved my life . 2. Give the gift of healthy eating. Rather than an expensive, artery-clogging brunch, you can spring for a visit with the nutritionist and follow it with a healthy meal. ""Mother's Day is a great reason to get your mom to see a nutritionist,"" said Dana Greene, a nutritionist in private practice in Boston. ""Nutritionists can really tailor their advice to whatever issues mom is having with her diet, including losing weight or learning how to eat to reduce her risk of certain diseases such as breast cancer or osteoporosis,"" Greene says. ""An appointment lasts about an hour and is relatively inexpensive. Take mom out for a healthy brunch afterward and watch her put all she learned into practice."" Health.com: How to eat out without getting fat . Greene also suggests subscribing to a healthy-cooking magazine to keep your mom in the healthy-eating mindset all year. Savard added: ""Make and freeze healthy foods in individual containers for your mom."" She suggested making healthy versions of your mother's fave foods. 3. Give the gift of organization. Instead of making a photo album of family snapshots (although that's nice too), make your mom a folder containing all of her medical records, Savard said. ""Put a folder together of test results and vital information so it is all in one place,"" she said. Make sure to include a list of all of her medications and what times she takes them. ""Having all this information in one place could end up saving your mom's life,"" Savard said. 4. Give the gift of a good night's sleep. Adequate sleep is linked to a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, as well as other health conditions. ""Buy your mom satin sheets, a new mattress, a mattress cover, or a luxurious pillow to encourage better sleep,"" Savard said. ""We know that restorative sleep is critical to our immune system and heart health."" For new mothers, offer to watch the baby while she takes a nap. This will also allow you to spend quality time with the kids, so ""it's a win-win,"" she said. Health.com: 10 Risk factors for heart disease . 5. Give the gift of healthful goodies. Instead of a gourmet gift basket filled with cheese and crackers or sweets, make your own healthy gift basket for your mom, suggests Savard. Not sure what to put in it? Start with a multivitamin, calcium supplements, and vitamin D supplements. ""If you know your mom is trying to get more fiber, put some fiber supplements in the basket too,"" she says. ""A pedometer, some arm weights, and maybe a tape measure can also be part of this gift,"" Savard says. A tape measure can help mom measure her waist size, which is a known risk factor for heart disease and diabetes. Health.com: Fitness and spa products that support the fight against breast cancer . 6. Give the gift that keeps on giving. Accessory and gift companies such as Presents for Purpose allow you to pay it forward this Mother's Day by picking gifts in which 10 percent of the proceeds benefit a charity of your choice. ""This year we are all trying to conserve money, so why not have your funds go further with a gift that gives back,"" said company founder, Alayna Kassan. Gift givers can choose from bathrobes, cosmetics bags, scented candles, and a plethora of other items -- many of which are ""green"" -- and then choose a meaningful charity from a list. ""When your mom gets the gift, she will be notified that it will benefit the chosen charity,"" Kassan said. ""We have a few breast cancer charities on the site and they all do well on Mother's Day."" Health.com: 5 Secrets to get slim success . 7. Give the gift of chocolate -- if you must. ""If you are a traditionalist and you must give chocolate, choose dark chocolate,"" Greene said. Dark chocolate contains antioxidants, which can mop up the damaging free radicals known to play a role in heart disease and other illnesses, as long as you choose types with less sugar and fewer calories. ""This way you can satisfy her sweet tooth and benefit her heart,"" she said. Enter to win a monthly Room Makeover Giveaway from MyHomeIdeas.com .

"Washington (CNN) -- What does it feel like to kill a man? James Lenihan of Brooklyn knew. He fought in Europe in World War II and he killed a German soldier during a battle in Holland. He described how it felt in a poem: . --- . I shot a man yesterday . And much to my surprise, . The strangest thing happened to me . I began to cry. --- . So begins ""Murder: Most Foul"" a work that echoes poetry about war in the tradition of William Shakespeare and borrows its title from the bard's ""Hamlet."" As powerful as the poem is, the story behind it is also fascinating. Sgt. James Lenihan returned home after the war, got married, had children and made a career as a salesman for the meatpacking industry. If he ever wrote any other poems, his son, Robert, and daughter, Joan, who still live in Brooklyn, don't know of any. In fact, they didn't know about this poem until after their father died. They found it when they were going through his possessions. Robert and Joan Lenihan found two typewritten pages, each with a copy of the poem. It was unsigned, but Robert believes the poem was written by his father and later typed up by his mother for safekeeping. He says the poem talks of the killing happening in Holland. James Lenihan served in Holland with the 104th Infantry Division, which battled German units there. The poem portrays a soldier very upset about taking a life: . --- . I knelt beside him . And held his hand-- . I begged his forgiveness . Did he understand? --- . But even while he describes the shooting as murder, he makes clear he had no choice: . --- . It was the War . And he was the enemy . If I hadn't shot him . He would have shot me. --- . Robert Lenihan said the poem is a bit unlike the father he grew up with. A man who could be a ""tough customer"" if need be. Not someone tormented by a fleeting, albeit from an intense moment on a battlefield in Holland. ""I'm just starting to appreciate how much he suffered only now in this part of my life. When I was a kid, like if he yelled at me or something, I'd say, 'Well Dad's being cranky,'"" Lenihan said. He said that even though the incident in the poem took place nearly 60 years ago, it resonates today and should let young soldiers coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan that they aren't the first to face such emotional turmoil as this. ""That feeling they may have of regret and pain and shock of what they've done. It shows they are not alone,"" Lenihan said. CNN sent James Lenihan's poem to Georgetown University Professor David Gewanter, who has published several books of poetry, including ""War Bird,"" published last year. Gewanter called ""Murder: Most Foul"" ""accomplished."" In an e-mail to CNN, he said the poem ""is good, and its truths are that of experience and some literary traditions."" Robert Lenihan sounded surprised when he heard Gewanter's analysis of his father's amateur poem. ""I'm very deeply touched,"" he said. ""For an expert to assess it that way and make such important comparisons -- I'm amazed and quite touched."" The poetry professor said Lenihan's poem reminded him of a famous portion of Shakespeare's play ""Henry V"": . --- . From this day to the ending of the world, . But we in it shall be remembered -- . We few, we happy few, we band of brothers . --- . But Gewanter said it perhaps most closely resembles ""The Man He Killed,"" a work by Thomas Hardy written at the start of World War I. In that poem, Hardy writes that the soldier and the foe he killed might have shared a drink or loaned each other money had they met somewhere other than a battlefield. James Lenihan's poem ends not with talk of loans or drinks, but a darker scene. --- . I shot a man yesterday . And much to surprise . A part of me died with Him . When Death came to close . His eyes. --- . To read the entire poem, go to www.dcoe.health.mil/blog/article.aspx?id=1&postid=102 .","Poem tells the anguish felt by one who killed a man in war .
It was the only poem James Lenihan is known to have written, his children say .

"(CNET)  -- Amazon plans to unveil a thinner Kindle with a sharper picture in August, according to a Bloomberg News report on Saturday citing anonymous sources. Two people familiar with the online retailer's plans told Bloomberg the next-generation e-book reader will not have a touch screen or color, but the display will be sharper and more responsive. Earlier this week at Amazon's annual shareholder meeting in Seattle, CEO Jeff Bezos said a Kindle with a color reflective screen is still a ways off. A story in The Wall Street Journal on the meeting quoted Bezos as saying he had ""seen several things in the laboratory, but they are not quite ready for production."" The New York Times reported in February that Amazon had bought Touchco, a New York start-up developing flexible multitouch panels. That led to speculation that the e-tailer was planning an answer to the iPad, Apple's tablet device. Bezos said Tuesday that Amazon intends to keep the Kindle focused on what it has always been -- a reading device. CNET e-mailed Amazon on Saturday afternoon seeking a comment on the Bloomberg report. Bloomberg said a call to an Amazon representative was not returned. On Thursday, Sony announced it is releasing its Reader -- which launched in the U.S. in 2006 -- in several new countries this year, including Japan, China, and Australia. Also on Thursday, Marvell said it's teaming up with the One Laptop Per Child foundation to create an inexpensive tablet, which they plan to show off at CES next year. © 2010 CBS Interactive Inc.

"(CNN) -- Rifts within the Anglican Communion could widen after the archbishop of Canterbury, who has condemned the consecration of openly gay bishops, urged a diminished role Friday for the Episcopal Church. Earlier this month, a Los Angeles, California, diocese ordained the Rev. Mary Glasspool, the first openly gay bishop ordained in the church since 2004, when Gene Robinson took his post in New Hampshire. The U.S. church has been criticized by conservative factions for openly gay ordinations. Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, the nominal head of Anglican Communion, shared his concern when Glasspool was consecrated, saying then that the move would further divide the 77 million-member worldwide denomination that includes the Episcopal Church in the United States. On Friday, he made an even stronger statement in a letter to the communion. ""Our Anglican fellowship continues to experience painful division, and the events of recent months have not brought us nearer to full reconciliation,"" Williams wrote. ""There are still things being done that the representative bodies of the Communion have repeatedly pleaded should not be done; and this leads to recrimination, confusion and bitterness all round. ""It is clear that the official bodies of The Episcopal Church have felt in conscience that they cannot go along with what has been asked of them by others, and the consecration of Canon Mary Glasspool on May 15 has been a clear sign of this."" Williams does not have the power to issue edicts like the pope, but he issued a five-page statement suggesting that provinces (such as the Episcopal Church) or national and regional churches that have broken agreed-upon ""promises"" should step down from participating in interfaith dialogues. He said they should also relinquish decision-making powers in a committee that deals with questions of doctrine and authority. Following Robinson's consecration, the communion leadership laid out three promises, or moratoria, according to the archbishop of Canterbury website: . -- No authorization of blessings services for same-sex unions. -- No consecrations of bishops living in same-sex relationships. -- No cross-border interventions (no bishop authorizing any ministry within the diocese of another bishop without explicit permission). Glasspool has been in an open same-sex relationship for 19 years, a violation of the moratoria. Robinson also was in a same-sex relationship at the time of his consecration. Conservative Anglicans have long called for Williams to punish the Episcopal Church by not inviting the church to the Lambeth Conference, a global meeting of Anglican leaders held every decade. Williams did not go far enough in his rebuke, a spokesman for a conservative Anglican group said Friday. Robert Lundy of the American Anglican Council said the Episcopal Church shouldn't be involved in any decision-making bodies within the Anglican Communion so long as it continues to ordain openly gay bishops and violate biblical teachings. Williams' statement only keeps the Episcopal Church off of certain committees within the communion, Lundy said. ""He [Williams] knows he has to do something because he's under pressure from all sides,"" he said. ""But unfortunately, the step he's taken in our view is not strong enough."" Bishop Ian Douglas of the Episcopal Diocese of Connecticut called Williams' statement ""significant"" but ""not as punitive as it might have been."" He said it was an affirmation of the three moratoria, and he made clear that other churches, not just the U.S. Episcopal Church, will be affected for having broken promises as well. ""Many churches across the Anglican Communion because of conscience or their belief in what the holy spirit is up to in their local context have lived beyond the moratoria,"" Douglas said. ""While the moratoria are still before us, such actions do have some ramifications. ... If anything, I question the efficacy of the moratoria."" He added, ""It's another expression of how we're trying to live with our differences with integrity and not alienate one another. I'm still convinced there's so much more that unites us.""","The Episcopal Church in Los Angeles recently consecrated an openly gay bishop .

"(CNN) -- The next generation of space robot is here. It looks like an astronaut in a spacesuit, with a head, a torso, two arms and two hands that can grasp and hold objects just like a human hand. Its name is R2, short for Robonaut 2. And it's heading to the International Space Station aboard the space shuttle Discovery in September. For more than three years, a team of General Motors engineers and NASA scientists worked side by side at the Houston's Johnson Space center -- designing, engineering and building the 300-pound, human-like machine. At first, the partnership between a space agency and an auto maker may seem unlikely but it made perfect sense for the R2 venture. GM has used both industrial and commercial robots in its auto assembly plants, mainly single-arm robots. ""We've used robots for years and years,"" said Marty Linn, GM's principal robotics engineer. ""We use robots in basically every single one of our manufacturing plants today around the world."" Turns out that what the astronauts need on a space mission is not very different from what an operator in an assembly plant needs. ""We spent a lot of effort working on the technologies that will allow us to have robots work right next to human operators very safely,"" Linn said. ""For General Motors, it's really about the the technologies and being able to make the robots safe to work around."" NASA has the same goal. ""This project exemplifies the promise that a future generation of robots can have both in space and on Earth, not as replacements for humans but as companions that can carry out key supporting roles,"" said a statement from John Olson, director of NASA's Exploration Systems Integration Office. ""The combined potential of humans and robots is a perfect example of the sum equaling more than the parts,"" he said. ""It will allow us to go further and achieve more than we can probably even imagine today."" Linn said the R2 will be an astronaut's helper. ""That's really what it was designed to do, to help astronauts in performing their regular tasks,"" Linn said. And at GM, he said, the R2 was about developing technologies that will help build safer manufacturing plants and better-quality vehicles. It's hoped that the robot will minimize danger to astronauts, relieve them of ergonomically challenging tasks as well as jobs that are dull and repetitive. R2 will be able to perform a variety of experiments in micro-gravity, basically working side-by-side with the astronauts, but will still be in a testing phase when it arrives at the International Space Station. It isn't built to withstand the extreme temperatures in space, so it will be confined to a lab inside the station. But in the years ahead, scientists hope the R2 will be enhanced enough to move freely around the complex. Is the R2 a precursor of things to come? Are there robotic teachers and robotic drivers in the near future? How about robotic babysitters or store clerks? ""I'm a big fan of imagination,"" Linn said. ""And certainly you could imagine all those things. Is it that far off? I don't think so.""","The robot's name is R2, short for Robonaut 2 .

"Fort Hood, Texas (CNN) -- A judge on Tuesday granted a defense request to delay the Article 32 hearing of Maj. Nidal Hasan, the Army psychiatrist accused of killing 13 people in a November shooting spree at Fort Hood, Texas, until October. Hasan made his first courtroom appearance in connection with the case Tuesday. The hearing was the first part of an Article 32 hearing, the military procedure similar to a civilian grand jury, for the case being built against him by the Army. Hasan uses a wheelchair after gunshot wounds he sustained in the November 5 incident. He wheeled himself into the courtroom, wearing his Army fatigues. He wrapped himself in a blanket during the hearing. Hasan offered short answers to questions posed by the judge, Investigating Officer Col. James Pohl. Asked whom he wanted to represent him, he named his three attorneys. Hasan appeared calm throughout the proceeding, at one point cracking a smile while speaking with his attorney. Security for the hearing was tight, with nearby streets blocked off and bomb-sniffing dogs present. Reporters went through two layers of security. The only people present at the hearing besides the media were legal assistants. Most of the hearing revolved around evidence Hasan's attorneys have asked for in the discovery process, the routine practice that is part of every criminal case, be it civilian or military. Hasan's lead civilian attorney, John Galligan, a retired colonel with three decades of experience as an Army lawyer, has asked for everything from DNA test results to crime scene video to copies of investigations of the shooting ordered by President Barack Obama. Last week, the Army delivered 2,000 pages of documents to Galligan, but many of the items he requested are still not available to the defense team, Galligan said. For example, dozens of shots were fired that day on the sprawling Army base in central Texas. Galligan asked for ""records of the measured angle of each trajectory, showing the trajectory from each bullet hole to the shooter's position."" The Army said in a court document filed in response, ""There are no documents of files of items responsive to the defense request at this time."" Galligan also has asked for all e-mails between Hasan and Yemeni-American cleric Anwar al-Awlaki. Prosecutors agreed Tuesday to release them to the defense. Defense attorneys also are requesting some classified documents. Prosecutors said Tuesday they are in the process of attempting to de-classify them. Pohl granted defense attorneys' request for the delay, although prosecutors said they would be ready to present evidence at the Article 32 hearing in July. Galligan's request makes clear that his defense case will delve into what happened before November 5. Hasan's lawyer has asked for reports of inappropriate or substandard work by Hasan while he was training at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington. Unlike a civilian grand jury hearing, Article 32 hearings involve both the prosecution and the defense, and witnesses are questioned by both sides. Galligan earlier told CNN that since the entire defense legal team, which includes Galligan and two military lawyers, has only met with Hasan once, the team needs more time to help build a case for him. CNN's Larry Shaughnessy contributed to this report.","Judge delays Article 32 hearing for Maj. Nidal Hasan until October .

"(CNN) -- If you've booked travel online, you may have been there. Nancy Cutter, a travel agent in Charlotte, North Carolina, discusses vacation options with a client. Online travel sites flooded with overwhelming options, all claiming the best deals. Extra fees nestled into the fine print amid blaring advertisements. Pounding 16 digits into the telephone after you've booked the wrong flight before finally getting a human voice. A few weeks ago, Darin Kaplan, a tech-savvy 27-year-old California restaurant manager, clicked his mouse hundreds of times, surfing the vast choices offered by online travel booking Web sites like Expedia.com and Orbitz.com to plan his 28th birthday cruise to Mexico before he gave up in frustration. ""It's a cut-and-paste experience when you're booking online. None of these sites are going to tell me what I can do with different options,"" said Kaplan, who uses the Internet for many purchases, including his basketball shorts and music tickets. ""Travel agents know what they are talking about. It's more comforting to hand my money to someone who has the knowledge and experience."" Some travelers like Kaplan are finding themselves defecting from travel booking sites like Travelocity.com or airline sites like Delta.com. They are going back the travel agent, an industry that many industry experts once thought to be passé with the advent of online booking. Fewer travelers are enjoying using the Web to plan and buy trips, according to a study last week by Forrester Research, a market research company. About 46 percent of U.S. leisure travelers enjoyed using the Internet to book travel this year, down from 53 percent in 2007. Difficult site navigation and presentation on travel company sites and hotel and airline sites are causing a growing number of travelers to shift away from the Web and consider using alternative methods of booking travel. ""People are saying 'I don't understand my options, and I would like to talk to someone who can do all the searching and tell me what's available,' "" said Henry Hartevelt, the analyst who wrote the Forrester study. ""Major travel agencies have absolutely failed in their responsibility to innovate and think of creative new ways to help their customers shop."" In the brick-and-mortar travel agent model, a trained agent meets with the traveler in person or establishes a relationship over the phone. For a fee, they discuss the travel options they have researched. These travel agencies began losing their monopoly on the industry during the late 1990s, when airlines began to sell tickets online and travel giants like Expedia.com exploded onto the scene, quickly gobbling market share by introducing the quick, do-it- yourself model. In 1995, there were 37,000 brick-and-mortar travel agencies, according to the American Society of Travel Agents. Now, only 18,000 exist after many merged or folded. ""What the Internet has done is given us a nation that knows the price of everything and the value of nothing,"" said Bill Maloney, CEO of the American Society of Travel Agents. ""How do you know if a hotel is actually a good value or if it's overpriced? You have these online generalists and these individual specialists."" Travel agent Nancy Cutter of Court Travel Ltd. in Charlotte, North Carolina, and a half-dozen other agencies across the country say they have experienced a surge in returning clients, who said travel Web sites were confusing and unhelpful. In several instances, brick-and-mortar agents say they were able to offer deals at the same price as, and even undercut, the travel agent models, dispelling the belief that the cheapest rate is online. Travel agents have deals with suppliers that can sometimes enable them to offer lower prices than on the Web. They also have time to cancel tickets for free, compared with some non-refundable tickets sold on the Web. Expedia.com said it recently waived the fee for travelers changing certain flights. ""Just because you can go out and buy Turbo Tax doesn't mean it's the best answer for everyone,"" Cutter said. ""Some people will still go to an accountant. Booking travel can get complicated, and it's just not as easy as it looks."" Travel agents don't discount the value of online travel agencies, which can be useful for booking simple, short trips, but they say complex itineraries require more expertise from a professional. Many online travel companies agree that an agent may be valuable in planning a detailed honeymoon that includes a tour of vineyards in France or a family excursion to top snorkeling and kangaroo-watching destinations in Australia. ""If you're the type of traveler who needs hand-holding up front, then sure, a travel agent would be great, but you can usually find that same information on the Web,"" said Brian Ek, a spokesman for Priceline.com, a travel company famous for letting bidders set their own price. He said the agents available by phone at his company can help facilitate a sale and customize cruises for travelers. Online travel companies say they have made functionality improvements on their sites in recent years. For example, Expedia.com, the world's largest online travel agency, offers a tool that can let customers compare seats on an airplane, with ratings on how comfortable a seat is and how much leg room is available. They also have hotel reviews and even Web tours of rooms to help travelers decide. And, research shows that online travel model is poised to grow. Even in a recession, when companies and individuals are scaling back on travel, Expedia.com saw a 22 percent air transaction growth rate in the last quarter. But Susan D. Tanzman of Martin's Travel and Tours in California, who has worked as an agent for 35 years, points out that agents follow up with travelers before and after the trip. If the traveler needs help, the agency can offer assistance. They often work 24 hours a day. JoAnne Kochneff, owner of midsize agency Travel by Gagnon in Michigan, said agents can give the personal attention a site cannot. Kochneff's office provides a homey feel, with agents offering freshly baked cookies for clients who stop by to chat about their trips. ""They have personal experience traveling in the area, so they can give you a personal recommendation,"" said Frances Mosser, 67, of Kentucky, on her reason why she switched to the travel agent model this summer. Mosser and her husband booked a trip to St. Melo in France with a travel agent. The agent helped them devise a way to reduce travel time by taking Ryan Air between countries. ""I don't think we could have planned the trip without her,"" Mosser said.","Study finds 46 percent of travelers enjoyed using Web to book travel this year .

"(CNN)  -- In his essay ""The Myth of Sisyphus,"" Albert Camus writes, ""Judging whether life is or is not worth living amounts to answering the fundamental question of philosophy."" It is not a question we like to think about. The default assumption is that life is always worth living, that it is sacred and should be treated as such. When that assumption is challenged, we find ourselves confused, afraid and -- in some cases -- angry. The new HBO film ""You Don't Know Jack"" probably won't spur serious investigation of the fundamental question. This biopic of Jack Kevorkian, the infamous ""Dr. Death,"" may not add anything new to the physician-assisted suicide argument, but it does remind us of a time not too long ago when we were forced to consider where we stand on the matter. And for many of us, where we stand is anything but firm ground. We believe in choice. We believe in self-determination. In fact, we prize them; we promote them; we preach about them. There aren't a lot of situations in which we're willing to take choice away from people, even if they would benefit from it. My research suggests that Americans hold on tighter to choice than just about anyone else. In one study, my collaborators Simona Botti and Kristina Orfali and I interviewed French and American parents who were coping with a tragic loss. Each couple had recently lost a severely ill baby after life support had been removed. In France, the doctors made the decision to remove life support; in America, the parents had the final say. The outcome was the same for all the parents, so did they have similar reactions? Even up to a year later, the American parents expressed a great deal more negative emotion than the French parents. The French made statements like this: ""Noah was here for so little time, but he gave us so much, a new perspective on life."" American parents, by contrast, said things like, ""I keep thinking to myself,  'What if I had chosen differently?' I feel as though I've played a role in an execution."" Although the American parents were more miserable having made the choice themselves, they would not contemplate doing otherwise. When they were asked whether they would have preferred to have the doctor make the decision, they all said no. They felt trapped by choice, and yet they insisted on it. If we can choose to take others off life support, choose to forgo medical treatment for ourselves, choose not to be resuscitated, and if these are choices we passionately defend, why do we balk at the choice of assisted suicide? There is legitimate concern about the potential for abuse, but we're tripped up by more than just the practical problems. We ask, ""Doesn't assisted suicide devalue life?"" We express what we can't quite articulate by saying that it feels wrong. In an interview with Barbara Walters, as shown in the film, Kevorkian argues that medical practices often seem wrong before they become right. He says that ether wasn't used as an anesthetic for hundreds of years, that patients remained awake during surgery, ""because of the foolish notion that there's a God Almighty who wills us to suffer."" Whether this is a fact or not, there is truth in it; we want our suffering to have purpose. According to Camus, ""Living, naturally, is never easy. You continue making the gestures commanded by existence for many reasons, the first of which is habit. Dying voluntarily implies that you have recognized, even instinctively, the ridiculous character of that habit, the absence of any profound reason for living, the insane character of that daily agitation, and the uselessness of suffering."" When we reject assisted suicide, we reject that ""recognition."" We need the habit of life to have meaning, we need suffering to have meaning, and we certainly need death to have meaning. And we think of choice as a way of making meaning, not taking it away. Actively choosing to die -- leaving no part of it to chance or other forces -- strikes us as not only devaluing life but devaluing death and devaluing choice. In order to have a serious conversation about assisted suicide, we may need to accept that sometimes choice, death and the choice of death don't lead to or reveal anything greater. I don't know if we're ready for that. I don't know if we should be. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sheena Iyengar.","Sheena Iyengar: Most of us think life is always worth living; assisted suicide challenges that .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A public memorial service for heavy metal rocker Ronnie James Dio is planned for Sunday, with members of the Westboro Baptist Church saying they will picket the ceremony. The church in Topeka, Kansas, is known for its intolerance of gays and its picketing of soldiers' funerals. A picketing schedule on the church's website said protesters will be at the Dio memorial at Forest Lawn Hollywood Hills in Los Angeles, accusing the 67-year-old rocker of worshipping Satan. Dio died on May 16 after a battle with stomach cancer. Charges of devil-worshipping have often been leveled against heavy metal music. Dio, in particular, was a favorite target. He popularized the ""devil's horn"" gesture, where the index and the little fingers are upright and the thumb is clasped against the two middle fingers. He has said he was taught by the sign by his superstitious Italian grandmother as a way to ward off the ""evil eye."" But many fundamentalist Christians have taken issue with the gesture, alleging that it is a tribute to the devil. ""Ronnie hates prejudice and violence. We need to turn the other cheek on these people that only know how to hate someone they didn't know,"" said Dio's wife, Wendy, about the planned protest. Wendy Dio said the memorial will host a donation center for her husband's ""Stand Up and Shout Cancer Fund,"" named after one his songs. Dio most recently was touring with Heaven and Hell, a version of Black Sabbath renamed for legal reasons. All shows were canceled last March because of his illness. His last public appearance was in April at the Revolver Golden Gods Awards, when he accepted a vocalist of the year award for his work on last year's Heaven and Hell album. Dio appeared frail, but he spoke while accepting his award. Born Ronald James Padavona in 1942, Dio's professional music career began as a high school student in the late 1950s. His 1960s rock group The Electric Elves evolved into Elf by the early 1970s, when the group played heavy blues rock. Dio's rock became darker with his band Rainbow, which he left in 1979 to join Black Sabbath. Black Sabbath released three albums with Dio, including ""Heaven and Hell"" in 1980, ""Mob Rules"" in 1981 and ""Live Evil"" in 1982. Dio left that band in 1982, but he had a brief reunion with the group a decade later. He formed the group Dio in 1982 and later Heaven and Hell.","Church says it will picket singer Dio's memorial service .

"(The Frisky) -- Carrie Bradshaw is not only a Manhattan and fashion icon, but as a dating columnist, she's considered a dating icon as well. Why? She's selfish, immature, manipulative, impulsive, and, let's face it, kind of psycho. The Frisky: 10 spoiler-free reasons to see ""SATC 2"" She gives women, even kooky women, a bad name. Ladies, feel free to emulate Carrie's style and visit her favorite NYC haunts, but when it comes to dating, it's best to do anything but what she does. Carrie makes several common mistakes throughout the ""Sex and the City"" series and by watching her missteps, women can learn a lot about what to do and, more importantly, what not to do, at all stages of a relationship. The Frisky: Cattiest reviews about ""Sex and the City 2"" Don't assume. When Carrie begins dating Mr. Big, she assumes that since she's not seeing anyone else, he's not either. Predictably, she's shocked when she finds him at dinner with another woman. Although she and Big had shared a bed together, they had only gone on two dates by that point; he certainly didn't owe her exclusivity, especially when they hadn't discussed it. If you don't want your new guy to date anyone else, make sure he knows it. While there's no magic time to have the ""what do we call this relationship"" talk, it's imperative that you have the talk at some point. Over-analyzing doesn't solve anything. Carrie often falls into the trap of over and over and over-analyzing every aspect of her relationships, wondering what each and every little tiny thing means. She looks for hidden meanings in the most ordinary events. When Big takes her to the same restaurant twice in a row, she looks for a secret motive. She listens to answering machine messages from him repeatedly, straining to hear what he's not saying. Sometimes, men are not up-front about why they do what they do, but most of the time, a restaurant is just a restaurant and a message is just a message. Stalking isn't sexy. ""Sex and the City"" existed in a time before cell phones were ubiquitous, Google was a verb, and posting on Facebook and Twitter became a national pastime. Yet Carrie still manages to stalk Big, following him to church to see what he does on Sundays and with whom, and concocting a scheme to meet his ex-wife. While there's nothing wrong with looking up a new date online, cyberstalking or, worse, actually stalking someone likely won't end well. When he finds out that you've been moonlighting as a private investigator, he won't be flattered. Instead, he'll wonder what he's getting himself into and will probably be ready to end what may have just started. Drama doesn't equal passion. Carrie is scared when Aidan seems ""too perfect."" She wants to know what's wrong with him and insists he must be hiding a big secret from her. As she ponders her new relationship, she writes, ""Do we need drama to make a relationship work?"" The answer is no. Unfortunately, many women equate drama with passion. A relationship filled with drama is usually exciting because you never know what could happen -- good or bad. That kind of excitement can be destructive and is ultimately unsustainable. A drama-free relationship isn't one that's necessarily without love or passion; it's one that's mature enough to not need the emotional roller coaster. The Frisky: I'm a ""Miranda"" type -- not a ""Carrie"" -- and I love it . ""Perfect"" doesn't exist. Even as Aidan is too perfect, Carrie insists on perfection when she goes out with Berger for the first time. She goes shopping for the perfect outfit and tries to think of what activity they can do to make it the perfect first date. However, she soon realizes that Berger isn't interested in her clothes or doing the best thing ever on a date; he's interested in her. When we strive for perfection, we're bound to be disappointed because no date, guy or relationship will ever live up to that expectation. Be the better person. In one of the most memorable scenes of the series, Berger dumps Carrie on a Post-it note. Was he nasty and immature? Absolutely! But was she right to yell at his friends when she ran into them at the club opening? No. Of course, she was hurt and angry, but she ranted at the wrong audience. Although he was a jerk, she made herself look ridiculous. Everyone is dumped at some point -- if you take the high road, he'll look like the bad guy and it won't look like he had a reason to end things. The Frisky: When he isn't over his old girlfriend . If you're not yourself around him, he's not right for you. When she's dating Aleksandr Petrovsky, Carrie subverts herself and her desires to please her new man. She feigns interest in his interests and eventually gives up her career, apartment and city for him. It's great to explore new things in a relationship --  in fact, one of the best aspects of dating is that it opens you up to new people and ideas -- but when you stop acting like yourself and start taking on your boyfriend's ideas and ideals, it's time to disentangle from the relationship and find yourself again. Magical endings are for movies. The series ends when Carrie reunites with both Manhattan and Big. Sweeping camera angles, soaring music, and kissing under lampposts in the rain are great for fiction, but sometimes holding hands on the couch says more about a couple's commitment to each other. Don't forget to cherish the small moments while you wait for the big ones that might never come.

"New York (CNN) -- Staring down a smoking homemade bomb and dismantling it is dangerous enough. Doing it with news cameras rolling on a busy Saturday night in the middle of Times Square is something Det. Patrick LaScala of the New York Police Department swears never entered his mind. Until the following day. ""You're home the next day, and you're really thinking about it. Then, you start to put the pieces together and you think, 'Wow,' "" LaScala said in an exclusive interview. LaScala was manipulating the police robot that laid the groundwork for one of his partners, Det. Raymond Clair. ""This was the first time that I went down on a vehicle, and I saw clocks and wires and gas and propane. I identified it as a bomb, and I had to look twice,"" Clair said. After 13 years as a bomb tech, that night was the one Clair says he'll remember the most. Clair and LaScala are part of New York's elite bomb squad, a unit whose size is a closely guarded secret. CNN was given special access to the unit in order to find out what a more typical day can be like. During one recent 16-hour shift, I watched the same five-man team who worked the bungled bomb plot in Times Square check their equipment, catch up on paperwork and make sure Dan-O, their explosives-sniffing dog, was raring to go. The K-9 is named for a member of the squad who died in the 9/11 attacks when one of the twin towers collapsed. On a busy side street outside their Manhattan offices, neighbors watched them go through their paces with the robot. ""We think they're great,"" one man said. Another passerby snapped a picture of the robot with her cell phone. ""Is that the robot that checks out bombs?"" she asked. It was. But robots, as sophisticated as they are, can only do so much. They're capable of blowing out windows, blasting a suspicious package to bits, photographing an object from several angles and sending those images to investigators. The squad doesn't want to publicize more specific details. Still, a human touch often can't be avoided. With help, bomb techs first crawl into an 85-pound protective suit that covers their bodies from head to toe. The feet nearly look like those of a platypus, the material is stiff and hot, and the chest plate is heavy. A helmet is cinched on around the neck, and an air hose keeps outside air flowing into the mask. Put on gloves, and it's hard to imagine that anyone in such bulky gear could maneuver and dismantle possible bomb components. But that's what they're trained to do. ""The more you do, and the more you get involved, the better you'll get when it's the real thing,"" Clair said. Det. Greg Abbate also was there for the ""real thing"" in Times Square. He said his training kicked in. ""There's a strong bond between us. We go to a job, there's very little talk. Everyone knows what they have to do,"" he said. Despite the immense dangers associated with the work, whenever the unit checks out a suspicious package, bomb technicians jockey for the opportunity to suit up. ""We actually have arguments over who's taking the job,"" added Abbate. When CNN traveled with them on a call, it was Abbate's turn to wear the gear. The bomb squad was called to check out a backpack found in a park near a police headquarters checkpoint. The team sped to the scene with sirens screaming. Other units ringed the perimeter. X-rays were taken. Abbate moved in. This time, he determined that this time, there was nothing to it. Sgt. John Ryan said it's necessary to assume the worst until the team moves in. ""Everything is a bomb until we say it's not a bomb, "" said Ryan. The days are long, but the men say they feel ""blessed"" to be part of the bomb squad. They laugh when people suggest they must be a little crazy to do such a dangerous job. ""It's an honor,"" LaScala said. And it never gets old. ""At the end of the day, it's just one day down and a lot more to go,"" said Det. Mike Garcia. CNN producers Julian Cummings and Ross Levitt contributed to this report.","CNN visits the bomb squad that handled the recent Times Square incident .

"Washington (CNN) -- Authorities evacuated Union Station, the main train terminal in Washington, D.C., for part of Sunday afternoon due to a chemical odor from an overheated battery system, according to a spokesman for the D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department. The evacuation ended just over an hour after it began, after a hazardous materials team responded and all train service had been suspended, said fire department spokesman Peter Piringer. One person was taken to a hospital for evaluation after complaining of dizziness, Piringer said. The odor, described as smelling like sulfur or natural gas, was due to the battery that backs up the train platform's lighting system getting overheated, the spokesman said. Amtrak spokesman Marc Magliari said all rail traffic in and out of the station was suspended for 75 minutes due to the evacuation. Delays from the temporary suspension would probably affect train service through the afternoon, Magliari said. Subway service continued to operate during the evacuation, but trains were not stopping at Union Station, according to the Washington Metro Area Transit Authority. Regular subway service was to resume shortly after the evacuation lifted.","Chemical odor causes hour-long evacuation at Washington, D.C.'s Union Station .

"(CNN) -- A new flow of oil emerged from BP's damaged undersea well in the Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday evening after a remote-controlled submarine successfully cut into the well's riser pipe. BP used robots in its latest attempt to curtail the flow of crude from the largest spill in U.S. history, which spread to barrier islands off Alabama and Mississippi on Tuesday. When the robot submarines cut into the undersea well's riser pipe, a fresh spew of oil temporarily obscured the view of the mechanical arm. The cut was a first step toward placing a cap over the well that has spewed hundreds of thousands of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico every day since late April. BP expects to make more cuts to the riser before bringing in a diamond saw to make a clean cut where the cap will be fitted. Doug Suttles, the company's chief operating officer, told CNN's ""John King USA"" that the procedure should collect the ""vast majority"" of the oil if it succeeds. ""We'll be putting the cap assembly, loading that out and sending it to the sea bed later tonight,"" Suttles said. ""We should be able to install this tomorrow. And hopefully by late tomorrow or Thursday, we should have this thing operating."" But the operation carries the risk that the flow of crude from the ruptured well could increase by up to 20 percent once the damaged riser is cut away. The job already has been complicated by pipework around the well that has had to be removed before massive metal shears could be brought to bear Tuesday evening, Suttles said. The gusher may not be shut down until August, when BP expects to complete relief wells that will take the pressure off the one now spewing into the Gulf. The 5,000-foot-deep well erupted after an explosion and fire aboard the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig on April 20. The rig sank two days later, taking 11 men with it and leaving up to 19,000 barrels (798,000 gallons) of oil pouring into the Gulf, according to federal estimates. After fouling sections of Louisiana's marshes over the past two weeks, the oil was spreading toward the northeast on Tuesday. Tar balls and patches of reddish-brown ""weathered"" oil came ashore on Dauphin Island, Alabama, south of Mobile, and on Mississippi's Petit Bois Island, off Pascagoula, authorities reported. Oil hits Alabama, Mississippi barrier islands . More than a dozen miles offshore, researchers from the Dauphin Island Sea Lab reported seeing more rust-colored swaths of oil spattering the surface of the Gulf. They ranged from the size of half-dollar coins to 30 or 40 feet long, said John Dindo, the laboratory's associate director. BP's handling of the spill has been sharply criticized by members of Congress, officials in the Gulf states and the Obama administration, which announced Tuesday that a criminal investigation of the spill was under way. In addition, federal officials will no longer hold joint news briefings with the company, the administration announced. Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen, the government's point man on the spill, will now become the face of the response effort. Allen told reporters in New Orleans, Louisiana, that his job is to speak ""very frankly with the American public."" Rear Adm. Mary Landry, who has been the Coast Guard's on-scene coordinator for five weeks, will be returning to her duties as chief of the service's New Orleans district office. Allen praised Landry's work leading ""an anomalous and unprecedented response"" to the spill, but said Landry now needs to focus ""on the larger array of threats"" to her district -- including this summer's Atlantic hurricane season, which began Tuesday. In Louisiana, Plaquemines Parish President Billy Nungesser warned that a hurricane in the area could drive more oil ashore. ""We don't want to scare anybody, but we need to be realistic about it,"" Nungesser said. ""If a storm does top out levees, it will probably bring oil with it."" He said residents who evacuate ahead of a hurricane might return ""not to a flooded home, but to a home that is completely contaminated with this oil."" Oil spill darkens hurricane fears . Tuesday also marked the start of the recreational fishing season for red snapper, a big draw for sport anglers in the region. But the season opened with a new blow to the region's fisheries industry as the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration extended its restrictions on fishing to almost a third of the Gulf. The closures extend southward to a point about 240 miles west of the tip of Florida and eastward to federal waters off the Alabama-Florida state line. The state of Mississippi announced a closure of some of its inland waterways to fishing after oil was found in the area. The closed area includes areas east of 88 degrees, 40 minutes west longitude, and south of the CSX Railroad, but not including Graveline Bayou and its tributaries. After a meeting with state attorneys general and federal prosecutors from Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder told reporters that the Justice Department was looking at possible criminal violations in connection with the spill. Justice Department launches investigation . ""If we find evidence of illegal behavior, we will be forceful in our response,"" Holder said. ""We have already instructed all relevant parties to preserve any documents that may shed light on the facts surrounding this disaster."" In a statement issued in response to Holder's announcement, BP said it would cooperate with any inquiry, ""just as we are doing in response to the other inquires that are already ongoing."" Suttles told CNN that there have been ""very few differences"" between company and federal officials working to cut off the spill. ""This is a team that's really all aligned on the same goals and has been since the beginning,"" he said. ""The government clearly presses us very hard to make sure we're responding as quick as we can. We're moving things forward, we're applying all the resources that we need to apply. But I would stress at the working level, those differences are really quite small."" BP, rig owner Transocean Ltd. and oilfield services company Halliburton have blamed each other for the disaster. But BP, as the well's owner, is responsible for the costs of the cleanup under federal law, and Suttles said the company has now spent more than $1 billion to clean up the oil. BP stock has taken a beating on Wall Street , plunging on Tuesday after the failure of last week's ""top kill"" attempt to close the well. The company's stock value is down more than a third since the spill began.

"San Salvador, El Salvador (CNN) -- The remnants of Tropical Storm Agatha were headed into the Caribbean Sea late Sunday after leaving behind more than 80 dead in Guatemala and El Salvador, authorities in those countries reported. Most of the dead were in Guatemala, where heavy rains triggered mudslides that collapsed homes and forced thousands to evacuate. The country's preliminary death toll was 73 on Sunday, with 49 of those reported in the province of Chimaltenango, said David de Leon, Spokesperson for the National Commission for the Reduction of National Disasters. That toll was expected to rise, he said. And El Salvador reported nine deaths from the storm. The government issued a red alert, the highest warning level, which shut down schools and opened up shelters for families in the affected areas, President Mauricio Funes said. Agatha, an Eastern Pacific storm, struck land Saturday and was downgraded from a tropical depression to a remnant storm on Sunday. It was last reported moving toward the western Caribbean on Sunday afternoon, but was expected to keep producing heavy rains through Monday, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. In Guatemala, the storm damaged more than 3,500 homes and forced the evacuation of more than 61,000 people, the nation's emergency office said Sunday. And in Mexico, the government's National Meteorological Service predicted torrential rain for Chiapas state, intense downpours in Tabasco and strong showers in Quintana Roo. Four other Mexican states were predicted to receive moderate rain. Strong winds also were forecast. Swollen rivers and mudslides were a concern. In Guatemala, four children were buried in a landslide outside Guatemala City, the nation's capital. Four adults were killed in the capital, disaster officials said. Another two children and two adults were killed when a boulder, dislodged by heavy rains, crushed a house in the department of Quetzaltenango, 125 miles (200 km) west of Guatemala City, officials said. Guatemala is already under a 15-day state of calamity because of Thursday's eruption of the Pacaya volcano, which killed at least three people. At least 1,800 people had already been evacuated to shelters. The volcano also shut down the capital's international airport. Ash from the volcano that covered city streets and other areas mixed with the heavy rain, forming a goo that caused many drainage systems to clog. Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom said damage from Agatha was probably worse than the destruction caused by Hurricanes Mitch in 1998 and Stan in 2005, both of which devastated the Central American country. ""The country is suffering a great tragedy, this attack by nature,"" Colom said from the Guatemalan emergency agency center. Emergencies were reported in all of Guatemala's 22 states, called departments. The worst, Colom said, was the Pacific Ocean port of Champerico, which is isolated. ""We have no way of getting there to help the public, which is in danger because of flooding,"" Colom said. The president said he has asked the international community for help. Agatha is the first named storm of the Pacific hurricane season. The Atlantic hurricane season starts June 1.

"(CNN) -- The death toll from Tropical Storm Agatha continued to grow Tuesday, with 152 reported killed in Guatemala, 16 in Honduras and nine in El Salvador. One-hundred people are missing in Guatemala and another 87 are injured, the nation's emergency agency reported Tuesday. In addition, nearly 125,000 people have been evacuated and 74,000 are living in shelters, said emergency official David de Leon. The previously reported toll for Guatemala was 123 deaths, 90 people missing and 69 injured. Guatemala also is feeling the effect of the Pacaya volcano, which erupted Thursday night and continued to spew ash Tuesday. Three people were killed when they were crushed by rocks strewn by the volcano. La Aurora International Airport in Guatemala City, the nation's capital, has been closed since Friday because of falling ash but was expected to open later Tuesday. Pacaya is located about 18 miles (30 kilometers) south of Guatemala City. Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom declared a 15-day state of calamity after the volcano eruption. Damage from Tropical Storm Agatha added to the devastation. Destruction from the storm has been widespread throughout the nation, with mudslides destroying homes and buildings and burying some victims. At least nine rivers had dramatically higher levels and 13 bridges collapsed, the emergency services agency said. In the northern part of Guatemala City, the downpour created a sinkhole the size of a street intersection. Residents told CNN that a three-story building and a house fell into the hole. Classes have been canceled this week in schools throughout the nation. In Honduras, where 16 people have died, President Porfirio Lobo declared a state of emergency Sunday. Nearly 12,000 people have been evacuated from their homes and about 3,200 were living in shelters, the Honduran emergency agency said Tuesday. More than 140 homes have been destroyed and another 700 have been damaged, the Permanent Commission for Emergencies reported. The situation in El Salvador was improving, officials said Monday. The rain stopped Sunday afternoon and river levels were beginning to diminish, officials said. Classes nationwide remained canceled, however, until further notice. Agatha was demoted from a tropical storm to a tropical depression Saturday night and lost its status as a depression Sunday evening. It was the first named storm for the Pacific hurricane season. The Atlantic hurricane season started Tuesday. CNN's Arthur Brice contributed to this report.","Death toll increases to 152 in Guatemala .

"(The Frisky) -- Sometimes, I suppose, even celebrities need a few extra bucks. Maybe they want to buy a new Benz or a house in the south of France or add a bowling alley to the basement of their mansion? Whatever their motive, many turn to advertising when singing, acting or modeling gigs start to dry up. Usually, they just stand around and talk about the product and the commercial isn't too much of a stretch. But some celebrity endorsements have left us scratching our heads. Take Dita von Teese who, this summer, is teaming up with Perrier for their new ""paparazzi"" line. We aren't really sure what burlesque and paparazzi have to do with sparkling water but, hey, it'll probably work. Here are nine more star hucksters peddling strange wares. The Frisky: 10 hottest Hollywood moms over 40 . Carrie Bradshaw is so PC now . In ""Sex and the City,"" columnist Carrie Bradshaw does all of her writing on a Mac. She's been shown typing away on it for many, many years -- through all the seasons and the first movie. But in ""Sex and the City 2,"" Bradshaw will be using an HP because of a partnership with Hewlett-Packard. She'll also be showing up in some of their television commercials, print ads, outdoor ads and online ads. Some of the other characters in the movie will be representing the product, too. And they think die-hard fans won't notice the switch? The Frisky: I sabotaged my relationship to have drinks with my ex . King of Darkness' soft spot for butter . Ozzy Osbourne did a spot for ... butter. Well, actually, it was for ""I Can't Believe It's Not Butter,"" which is a combination of chemicals meant to resemble butter. Still, who'd have guessed this old rock star would be doing food ads? Perhaps they paid him in alcohol? At least they didn't have him spread the stuff on a bat. Punk icon turned insurance salesman . Iggy Pop showed up in a commercial for Swift Cover, which is some kind of insurance for your insurance. That's pretty strange in and of itself but the ad featured Iggy dancing, twitching and sweating while standing topless in front of a purple screen and saying weird things through a clenched, wrinkly jaw. This is a good way not to sell a product. The Frisky: 14 examples of the worst facial hair in Major League Baseball . Designer Coke . In April, Karl Lagerfeld teamed up with Coke, designing a new and very pretentious-looking Coca-Cola ""Light"" bottle, to be sold at $5 a pop. Not surprisingly, it is a chic combo of black, white and pink and has a picture of Lagerfeld on it. Die-hard fans can purchase the $80 boxed set at the exclusive Colette boutique in Paris, which comes with one bottle of Lagerfeld's Coca Cola ""Light,"" a display box, and a bottle opener. Or, you Coke fans just buy a regular bottle of Coca-Cola for $.99? Water does her hot body good . We all know hot models and celebs move products off shelves, but now even bottled water companies are using super hot stars to push their products. Recently, Jennifer Aniston teamed up with Smart Water and their new ad shows the 41-year-old actress posing with rock-hard abs and a big bottle of the pricey water. The ads call Smart Water Aniston's ""workout partner,"" but, let's face it: it's just water, which is basically everyone's workout partner. Twilight star's titillating print ad . Ashley Greene, who played Alice in ""Twilight,"" also did a weird stint for advertising all in the name of ""healthy"" water. She wore a painted-on swimsuit (and nothing else but paint) that made her look like she was covered in scales for SoBe's Lifewater, a calorie-free drink that's sort of like water, but it's not. Alice Cooper eats peas for cash . In one of the weirdest duos I've seen in a long time, Alice Cooper paired up with British TV star Ronnie Corbett to do a spot for Britain's Sky TV Channel. I was too busy watching Cooper and Corbett converse and stuff peas and potatoes in their faces to figure out what the commercial was actually for. It certainly doesn't help that the dialogue in it is incredibly difficult to understand. The Frisky: How celebrities get in shape for summer . Fred Flintstone sold cigarettes . About 40 years ago, Fred Flintstone was pushing Winston Cigarettes. The commercial shows Fred going into a cave to buy some cigs. Then, he gets into a conversation with the shop owner about how awesome Winstons are. He proudly claims he'll never smoke anything else. That is, until scientists found out cigarettes cause cancer and he switched to hawking kids' vitamins and mac n' cheese shapes. Gorbachev's political pizza spot . Although former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev isn't technically a celebrity, his commercial for Pizza Hut in 1997 was just too weird not to mention here. The ad, which is subtitled, features Gorbachev chowing down in a very rustic-looking pizza restaurant while people praise his political prowess. The whole thing was meant to promote Pizza Hut's ""the edge"" pizza, which had toppings that went all the way to the edge of the crust. Huh?

"(The Frisky) -- When Michael Jackson died last summer, it kick-started a year with a disturbing number of celebrity deaths. Which is why we are so extremely overjoyed when a celebrity survives a life-threatening incident. Of course, we are referring to rocker/reality TV star Bret Michaels. Over the past few months, Bret has had a series of extremely close calls. First, in mid-April, he was rushed to the hospital for an emergency appendectomy. Not two weeks later, he had a brain hemorrhage that left him in the ICU for more than a week. ""I'm lucky to be alive,"" he told People at the time. But as soon as he was on the mend, he had a warning stroke. As doctors examined him to see what was up, they found that he also has a hole in his heart. The Frisky: 10 bizarre deaths of celebrity pets . But just days later, Bret was feeling better and managed to make it to the live taping of the season finale of ""Celebrity Apprentice."" There, he triumphed over Holly Robinson Peete and walked away the show's victor. Seriously, this guy is unbreakable. He's scheduled for surgery for the fall to make sure his lover-boy heart keeps on beating. So what other stars have had near-death experiences? Answer: a lot of them. Lance Armstrong . What's better than having a brain hemorrhage, a warning stroke, a hole in your heart and still making it to the ""Celebrity Apprentice"" finale? Defeating testicular cancer and going on to win seven Tour de France titles. When Lance Armstrong was diagnosed with cancer in 1996, it had already spread to his lungs and brain. But with surgery to remove tumors and chemotherapy, he was able to beat the disease and return to cycling in 1999. Live strong, indeed. The Frisky: Top 10 lies women tell men . Jason Priestley . Jason Priestley of ""Beverly Hills, 90210"" has cheated death on repeat. In 1999, while driving drunk, he crashed his Porsche. A few years later, he was involved in a serious boat accident. Then in 2002, he was in a pre-race crash on a Kentucky speedway that left him with a fractured spine and several other injuries. Here's hoping that's the last crash for Brandon Walsh. Boy George . Boy George was almost killed by, of all things, a disco ball. In 1999, Culture Club was rehearsing at a venue when a 62-pound ball snapped, falling and clipping George on the way down. He suffered minor injuries, but if he was standing a few feet over he could have been in big trouble. The Frisky: The 10 worst-dressed men in Hollywood . Kanye West . Kanye West was in a nasty car crash driving home from his recording studio in 2002 at 3 a.m. His rental car was totaled, but he walked away with just a fractured jaw. Eminem . In 2005, Eminem came close to overdosing after taking an entire handful of methadone pills. His doctor said this was the equivalent of shooting up four bags of heroin. And this was on top of the 20 prescription pills he was taking a day. Last May, Eminem told Vibe he'd been sober for a year. Let's hope it stays that way. The Frisky: Kim Kardashian speaks about plastic surgery and her famous bod . Dustin Hoffman . Back in the 70s, Dustin Hoffman lived in New York City in an apartment next door to a member of the radical student anti-war group Weather Underground. The group was evidently making bombs in the apartment, and a stick of dynamite was accidentally set off. Luckily, Dustin had stepped out of his apartment at the time. 50 Cent . 50 Cent was famously shot nine times in 2000 in Queens, New York, and lived to tell the tale. Joaquin Phoenix . Joaquin Phoenix was driving in Los Angeles when the brakes of his car gave out. His car flipped and he collided with another vehicle. Phoenix was helped out of the car by a passerby -- strangely, director Werner Herzog -- and was uninjured, thanks to his seat belt. A good reminder to buckle up! The Frisky: 8 celeb nerds landed real-life super hotties . Martin Lawrence . In 1999, Martin Lawrence had a near-death experience. He was jogging in 100-plus degree heat to lose weight for a movie role and collapsed from heat exhaustion. He was in a coma for the next three days, but luckily managed to pull through. Jim Caviezel . While filming ""The Passion of the Christ,"" Jim Caviezel was struck by lightning. Even stranger, the assistant director who was struck with him got hit by lightning again during the making of the film. Both were OK. But creepy. The Frisky: 8 famous females rejected by Playboy . Hugh Hefner . Hugh Hefner revealed the moment he almost met his maker in the tell-all book ""Mr. Playboy."" Apparently, in 1977, while with Playmate Sondra Theodore, Hefner almost choked on a bedroom toy. He came close to passing out before Theodore allegedly dislodged the mysterious item. Bob Dylan . In 1966, Bob Dylan was in a mysterious motorcycle crash near his house in Woodstock. He says he broke several vertebrae and that the near-death experience led him to lead a more reclusive life.

"London, England (CNN) -- At least 12 people have been killed and 25 injured after a gunman -- believed to be a local taxi driver -- went on a shooting spree through three small towns in the English county of Cumbria on Wednesday. After a large scale search, Cumbria police found the body of the suspected gunman, 52-year-old Derrick Bird, in a wooded area of Boot, a village in the Lake District, a popular tourist area. Authorities seized a gun from the scene where the body was found. Cumbria Police Deputy Constable Stuart Hyde said investigators believe Bird committed suicide. ""I've never known anything like this, where somebody would want to walk out and kill so many people in such a beautiful place in such a short space of time,"" Hyde said. Police were working 30 separate crime scenes and are still attempting to determine the motive, Hyde said. Investigators are looking at Bird's history and his access to firearms, he said. Police named Bird as a suspect following reports of the first shooting mid-morning on Wednesday in the Irish Sea port town of Whitehaven. UK guns laws tightened after massacres . ""Our focus is now on the movements of Mr. Bird this morning,"" authorities said. ""Our thoughts are with the families in these tragic times. We are asking for any witnesses to come forward and help us with our investigation into the events of this morning."" British Prime Minister, David Cameron said the government would do whatever it could to help the communities affected. ""When lives and communities are suddenly shattered in this way, our thoughts should be with all those caught up in these tragic events, especially the families and friends of those killed or injured,"" he said. Were you there? Send us photos, images . Armed police patrols and dog squads were dispatched in the hunt for the gunman after the first shots were fired at 10:35 a.m. (5:35 a.m. ET) in Whitehaven. Police issued a photo of the Bird and urged members of the public to stay indoors until further notice. More shots were fired in the small towns of Seascale and Egremont, with officers attempting to track the suspect on land and by air while ambulance crews attended the victims. Footage from one of the shooting scenes showed a covered body lying on a street. ""Police are working to identify the individuals and inform relatives,"" Cumbria police said. ""Ambulance crews are in attendance across the area."" Peter Leder, who said he was a friend of Bird's, told CNN he spoke to Bird last night and was told: ""You won't see me again."" Bird was initially driving a dark gray or silver Citroen Picasso, but police later said he had abandoned his car in the area of Boot, in the Lake District, and was traveling on foot. Soon afterwards police said they had found a body in a wooded area. The Lake District is a scenic rural retreat in northern England which is popular with walkers, hikers and tourists. Leder said Bird has been an independent taxi driver in Whitehaven for more than 20 years and described him as ""an outgoing, well-known guy, who everyone liked."" Bird was divorced several years ago and has two children, both boys, who have moved away from home, he said. Bird is very close to his mother, who is very ill in a local nursing home, Leder said. He said his friend enjoyed scuba diving, went on several diving trips abroad and practised regularly at the Whitehaven swimming baths. The vehicle police said Bird was driving at the time of the shootings was his regular taxi cab, Leder said. A police hotline was set up for concerned relatives of those involved. John Bevir, a reporter for CNN affiliate ITV, described nearby Whitehaven as a sleepy seaside town. ""Things like this just don't happen here,"" he said. ""Well, they didn't, until this morning.""

"(CNN) -- Federal authorities plan to unseal charges Monday against several people arrested in a series of weekend raids in Michigan, Ohio and Indiana, prosecutors in Detroit said Sunday. At least seven people were arrested on charges that were under seal over the weekend, a law enforcement source said Sunday. Gina Balaya, spokeswoman for the U.S attorney's office in Detroit, said those charges will be revealed during a federal court hearing Monday. Mike Lackomar, a county leader for the Southeast Michigan Volunteer Militia, said the target of the raid was a Christian militia group called the Hutaree. The group proclaims on a Web site that it is ""preparing for the end time battles to keep the testimony of Jesus Christ alive."" The FBI would disclose no details of the raids. The law enforcement source told CNN the arrests were unrelated to any terrorist plot. The source would not confirm Hutaree members were among those arrested, but said the suspects were not planning attacks against government targets and the raids were unrelated to recent threats against members of Congress. At least two arrests were made in Huron and Sandusky, Ohio, but the case is being handled out of Detroit, said Scott Wilson, an FBI spokesman in Cleveland. Lackomar, who cited the FBI for his information, said several Hutaree members were arrested at a wake for one of the group. He said the Hutaree group trained with his organization ""on a couple of occasions in years past,"" but his group stopped about a year ago, after the Hutaree had an ""issue"" with federal firearms regulators. He did not elaborate. Lackomar called the Hutaree a ""religious militant group"" with about a dozen members, who scattered as news of the raids spread over the weekend. He told CNN his own group is aimed at ""aiding the community in times of emergency"" and had nothing to do with the raids. CNN's Carol Cratty, Pat St. Claire and Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","Federal authorities plan to unseal charges Monday; at least 7 arrest over weekend .

"Nashville, Tennessee (CNN) -- Tennessee is living up to its Volunteer State moniker as residents grapple with the aftermath of deadly flooding that left widespread damage and an untold number of displaced residents in its wake. Neighbors are rescuing neighbors. Strangers are chipping in to clean up devastated homes and businesses. Although many have lost everything tangible, their optimism remains intact. ""I'm alive,"" Ronnie Coleman said. ""Everything else, the rest of my life, if I have to fight cancer or whatever -- hey, man, it's going to be a piece of cake to what I went through."" After two days of torrential rain, Coleman waded through chest-high water this weekend at his home in the Whites Creek suburb of Nashville -- a daunting task for a man who can't swim. His neighbor, Willie Mae Stricklandjordan, whose every belonging was ruined in the flooding, described what happened when Whites Creek overflowed: ""The water just gushed in -- and it had a force to it."" Another neighbor, Evelyn Pearlbell, said she had to be rescued. ""They put this rope around me and pulled me through this water,"" she said. ""Scary. Phew, I was so scared."" As of Friday morning, the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency said that 21 people had died, one from natural causes. Davidson County was hit the hardest, with 10 fatalities. The federal government has declared 27 counties major disaster areas, the agency said. Aid and supplies were flowing in to Tennessee, including 167 truckloads of water. Country singers, who hold Music City USA dear, pledged monetary donations, and some converged on Nashville to help with the cleanup. Reports of rescues emerged from the Coast Guard, local rescue teams and average citizens as helicopters and boats canvassed the region for survivors. Nashville's police and fire departments were going door-to-door, making sure homes were evacuated. They tied yellow caution tape to the doors of places that had been cleared. Ben Perkins said he and his son, Will, searched for survivors for about seven hours in Bellevue on Sunday, rescuing people from the River Plantation subdivision and from stranded cars on a nearby highway. They initially took their boat to Will's great-grandmother's house, but she had been rescued, so Perkins began looking for others in need. Will manned a cellular phone, acting as a ""control center"" during the 15 to 18 rescue trips, his father said. ""Tennessee's come together. Nashville's come together,"" Perkins said. ""There's a lot of devastation. There's going to be a lot of need for donations."" Even with all the rescue operations, many residents had close calls. Betty Belle Nicks had to cling to a tree and then swim to the rooftop of her new home for refuge. Three small dogs made it to the roof and were saved, but Thursday night, she was looking for her yellow Labrador retriever, Ben, who swam away. ""If we could find Ben, it'd be the best wedding gift in the world,"" said Nicks, who was married last week. Jamye Howell was driving his Jeep through Hendersonville on Sunday when he drove over a bridge and through what he thought was a puddle -- just ""water standing on the road,"" he told CNN affiliate WZTV. ""Immediately, water was flowing in the car, and there was water flowing up on the windshield instantly,"" said Andrea Silvia, who was in the car with Howell. ""We decided that we needed to get out on top of the car and hope for the best,"" Howell told WZTV. The two swam about a mile to safety, they told the station. As the water continued to recede and rescue tales emerged Friday, many were struck by the devastation the flooding had wrought. Others still searched for loved ones, holding out hope that they may still be alive after almost a week. In Pegram, cadaver dogs searched Thursday along the Harpeth River for Danny Tomlinson, a 39-year-old amateur fighter who works for a prosthetics company. Friends and family members joined the effort, which had been ongoing for five days and had covered an almost 15-mile stretch of river. His car, which was swept away Saturday, was found Tuesday. A friend who was also in the car was found alive. Tomlinson's mother said, ""I'm trying to stay strong because I've got to have hope that they're going to find my son. I want to find him alive."" She pleaded to a higher power for help: ""Please, God, guide us. If he is in the water, which I don't want to think that, guide us there. Guide us to him -- for closure."" With more disaster declarations looming and residents and officials left to wonder the true toll of the weekend's deluge, several Tennesseeans said they felt confident that the area would persevere. ""Nashville has a spirit that won't be put down, so yes, I have no doubt that Nashville will come back,"" said Brenda Griffiths, who wore plastic bags over her feet as she assisted with the cleanup effort in Bellevue. Back in Whites Creek, evacuated residents said they feared returning home to see the devastation, but Reba Perkins said, ""We prayed that whatever we found, it would be something we could learn from."" Carolyn Phillips said the flooding left her worried about her future, but optimism had not escaped her. ""I'm going to be OK,"" she said. ""We're going to be OK."" CNN's Anderson Cooper, Martin Savidge, Gary Tuchman and Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report.","Tennessee officials say more than 21 dead, 27 counties labeled disaster areas .

"(CNN) -- A Southern California teenager has serious bragging rights: After docking back in his home state late Thursday morning, Zac Sunderland, 17, can claim to be the youngest person to sail around the world alone. The hardest part of a solo voyage is always being tired, Zac Sunderland says. Sunderland was greeted with thunderous applause and congratulations as he arrived at Marina del Rey in his 36-foot sailboat. ""It's kind of crazy to have it done now because, I mean, for the past year I've been just fighting for the next ocean, fighting to get back. And now I'm back so it's amazing,"" he said. The teen acknowledged the 27,500-mile voyage wasn't easy. He told CNN that pirates off the coast of Indonesia gave him quite a scare. ""[I] had a boat circle in and ended up calling in the coast watch and they chased them off but, yeah, [I] lucked out there! About an hour and a half of hell."" Severe storms also were a problem, he said. Sunderland's Web site says he bought the boat with his own money. His parents had hoped he would find something that would spark a fire in him, a passion that would direct him away from all the negative and harmful influences that are so prevalent in society, but even they were stunned by the scope of his dreams and desires, it says.  Watch Sunderland give advice to fellow teens » . He was 16 when he left Marina del Rey on June 14, 2008, aboard his boat, Intrepid. Solitude and exhaustion were just a couple of factors that faced him each day. ""The hardest constantly was the tiredness,"" he said. ""I mean, you get over the loneliness, but tiredness, it's an ongoing thing. Half the time I haven't slept in 48 hours and it's just hard to get enough rest."" Sunderland said he made some good contacts along the way. ""It's interesting just thinking back to the different places in the world because I have so many friends in different parts of the world that are like family, you know, and all these different experiences,"" he said. ""It's an amazing year. It seems like yesterday that I was here but in other ways it seems like a hundred years."" So what's next? ""Yeah, I don't know, just go chill with my friends,"" he said.

"(Tribune Media Services) -- We don't know where to look first. The massive pillars, looking like tree trunks, stone chameleons, tortoises and turtles, help support the columns. The sheer size of the place is amazing. Some of the towers soar more than 500 feet. Even jaded teens, like my 13-year-old niece, Erica Fieldman, can't help but be impressed. Antoni Gaudi's Sagrada Familia is Barcelona's most famous site and Spain's most visited. Welcome to Antoni Gaudi's unfinished masterpiece, the Sagrada Familia, Barcelona's most famous site and Spain's most visited. More than 40 years after the eccentric and revered architect's death -- he was struck by a tram -- work still continues on the huge church first begun in 1882. Some 2.5 million people visited last year. This is a great place to engage the kids in a scavenger hunt. (Find the fruit carved on top of the towers, the young stone musicians, the birds.) There are two completed facades -- one represents the birth of Jesus, the other the Passion of Christ. (If you look closely, you'll see Gaudi's face.) It's amazing that the project continued after anarchists burned Gaudi's studio, along with the plans for the church, during the Spanish Civil War. Luckily, Gaudi had made plaster models of the church (we see them in the museum at the site) and though they were also smashed, his supporters were able to painstakingly put them back together so the work could continue. Gaudi, so obsessed at the end of his life with completing the church, slept on a bed in his workshop. He is buried in the church's crypt. I want to go to the top (you take an elevator, but walk down the stairs), but I think Erica has had enough. Sometimes, you have to know when to call it quits, even at incredible sites like this one. I tell myself Erica will come back some day and remember how she couldn't decide whether she was bored or fascinated. Park Guell garden complex, designed to be a housing development, was Gaudi's largest work in Barcelona. It's a garden city with fantastically shaped roofs, a house that looks as if it's made out of candy, and the famous serpentine bench made out of broken mosaic. Unfortunately, no one in Barcelona gravitated toward the idea. The only three houses built were for Gaudi, the developer and the developer's lawyer. I'd live there in a minute for the spectacular views of Barcelona. We all love the giant mosaic dragon. ""Cool,"" Erica says. Sometimes when trying to show kids new cities, you can't hope for more than that. Barcelona, home to the 1992 Summer Olympics, is a city that appeals to kids (especially teens) and parents. In recent years, it's become a favorite of American families who board cruise ships here in summer -- as we did last year. If you plan to do a lot of touring, get the Barcelona card, which includes free public transportation, museum admissions, restaurant discounts and more. There are some 10,000 restaurants in Barcelona and 35,000 shops. (Did you know more than 20 percent of all spending in Spain takes place here? And with such friendly locals, there's no better place for the kids to practice their Spanish. (Starting this spring, American Airlines will fly nonstop from New York to Barcelona. Walk off your jet lag by taking in all the chic couples walking along the beach, the city's famous art nouveau architecture, the art, (Picasso lived here as a teen), the ancient Gothic Quarter and the street entertainers along the mile-long Las Ramblas. Ever see a human flower statue? A bird market? I never saw so many different kinds of gummies than at the famous Boqueria food market, said to be the largest in Europe. It's been here for centuries. The kids will give a thumbs up to Montjuic, one of Barcelona's largest recreation areas, which rises nearly 700 feet above the south side of the city. We're holing up overnight at the Hotel Arts Barcelona, a Ritz Carlton, a famous icon of the Barcelona skyline and a short walk from the beach and many of the city sites. There's nothing like a luxury hotel when you are jet lagged. The place is packed with families, even on the concierge level where parents and kids indulge in free breakfasts, snacks and drinks. Another highlight is the secluded pool area next to the distinctive shadow of the Frank Gehry fish sculpture. But before we hit the pool -- or fall asleep -- a little culture is in order. My pick: Museu Picasso. It's housed in three spectacular stone mansions in the historic quarter of the city and showcases works from the artist's early years, his Blue Period and early works from Barcelona. Picasso moved here in 1895 at the age of 14 and donated some 2,500 art pieces to the museums in 1970. (Show your young artists what he did as a kid!) That night, after we hit the pool, we head to Bestial, which the hotel concierge told us is a ""hip"" gathering spot for locals. I didn't really see evidence of that, but, after all, we were there at 8:30, early by Barcelona standards. Even Erica agreed the food was great, especially the wood-fired pizza. Donkey or Bull, our amiable guide Bernard Liso asks the next morning. The bull, of course, is the national symbol of Spain. The donkey is the symbol of the Catalans. We learn that people in Barcelona speak Catalan as well as Spanish and there's a fierce matter of national pride. From its earliest days, Barcelona has been linked to France, thus the emphasis here on Catalan -- Catalonia lies midway between France and Spain. I'm determined to have Paella for lunch. We are in Barcelona after all. Paella, of course, is the famous Spanish rice dish that's usually topped with chicken, sausage and shellfish. We head to a small restaurant in the old historic quarter of the city, Los Caracoles. I'm completely charmed by the mosaics and the open kitchen, the way the rooms of the restaurant wind up around an old staircase. Erica unfortunately isn't. ""I just won't eat,"" says Erica, after perusing the menu. There's no pasta and she doesn't want anything else. We dig into our paella. Erica agrees to taste it, as long as I take the shells off the shrimp. Not bad, she says, helping herself to more rice. I just sip my sangria and don't say a word. A few months later, Erica tells me she's already decided where she wants to go abroad when she's in college -- Barcelona. E-mail to a friend .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A man accused of taping ESPN sports reporter Erin Andrews in the nude through hotel peepholes and posting the videos online will plead guilty to a federal stalking charge, according to a court document filed Thursday. Michael David Barrett, 48, will enter a plea on December 15, said Thom Mrozek, spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in the Central District of California. A criminal complaint filed in October accused Barrett of taping Andrews then making seven videos that he posted on the Internet. Barrett's lawyer, David Willingham, issued a statement saying his client apologized to Andrews. ""Mr. Barrett accepts full responsibility for his conduct. He apologizes to Ms. Andrews, and expresses his deep regret for his conduct that caused her so much pain. It is his sincere hope that these events can now become an opportunity to make positive changes in his life,"" the statement said. Barrett was arrested in Illinois but will appear in Los Angeles federal court, Mrozek said. Barrett is charged with interstate stalking, which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison. An Illinois judge released Barrett on bail in October. Andrews, 31, is a sideline reporter for ESPN, traveling around the country covering college football games. According to the October criminal complaint, Andrews said that she became aware of the videos in July and that their posting has caused her distress, anxiety and trouble sleeping. Her lawyer, Marshall Grossman, told CNN that Andrews is still shaken. ""She is a very strong young woman. Time is a good healer,"" Grossman said. ""However, she continues to feel and experience the ramifications of what occurred every time she steps foot into a hotel room, and in her business, she lives in hotel rooms."" Andrews is now accompanied by additional security, Grossman said. Grossman said he and Andrews are in the process of reviewing the evidence against Barrett and the plea agreement, and Andrews will speak before the court at the hearing next week. He said Andrews wants ""severe punishment"" for Barrett. The plea agreement filed Thursday alleges that Barrett recorded videos of Andrews while she stayed at hotels in Columbus, Ohio; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and Nashville, Tennessee. The filing alleges Barrett made reservations at the hotels and altered the peepholes to shoot video of Andrews. Barrett allegedly attempted to sell the videos to celebrity gossip site TMZ in January 2009. TMZ did not purchase the images, but employees of the Web site assisted in the investigation by providing information to Andrews' attorneys, authorities said. Barrett posted the videos to other Web sites, Thursday's filing said. CNN's Khadijah Rentas and Sonya Hamasaki contributed to this report.","Suspect's lawyer: Client apologizes to Erin Andrews .

"(CNN) -- Tiny diamonds found in the soil are ""strong evidence"" a comet exploded on or above North America nearly 13,000 years ago, leading to the extinction of dozens of mammal species, according to a study. Diamonds found in North American soil suggest a comet led to the extinction of dozens of mammal species. The scientific report also suggests the cataclysm also reduced the population of the earliest people to inhabit the region and triggered a 1,300-year-long cold spell that stretched around the world. The heat generated by the extraterrestrial impact likely melted much of a glacier that once covered the Great Lakes region, sending a massive flood down the Mississippi River, the study said. According to the report, the cold waves of glacial runoff into the Gulf of Mexico shifted Atlantic Ocean currents, changing climate patterns throughout the world in a cooling period known as the Younger Dryas. ""A rare swarm"" of comets rained over North America about 12,900 years ago, sparking fires that produced choking, leading ""to the extinction of a large range of animals, including mammoths, across North America,"" the report said. The study was conducted by a group of eight archaeologists and geologists from the universities of Oregon and California, Northern Arizona University, Oklahoma University and DePaul University. Their findings were published Friday in the journal Science. iReport.com: Have you ever seen a comet? Show us . The prehistoric humans known to have inhabited the continent at the time of the event -- hunters and gatherers dubbed the Clovis culture -- suffered a major decline in population in the aftermath, the scientists said. The scientists studied layers of sediment dated to 12,900 years ago at six North American locations, including one directly on top of a Clovis site in Murray Springs, Arizona. Each layer was rich in nanodiamonds, which are produced under high-temperature, high-pressure conditions created by cosmic impacts, the report said. ""The nanodiamonds that we found at all six locations exist only in sediments associated with the Younger Dryas Boundary layers, not above it or below it,"" said University of Oregon archaeologist Douglas Kennett. ""These discoveries provide strong evidence for a cosmic impact event at approximately 12,900 years ago that would have had enormous environmental consequences for plants, animals and humans across North America."" The other sites studied were in Bull Creek, Oklahoma; Gainey, Michigan and Topper, South Carolina, as well as Lake Hind, Manitoba; and Chobot, in the Canadian province of Alberta.","Study: Diamonds found in North America links comet to climate change, extinction .

"(CNN) -- Director Chen Kaige's films often examine the close ties of love, passion and friendship, but his own relationship with his artist and filmmaker father is one that has informed much of his life and colored his work. Chen Kaige captures the pains and passions of relationships on the silver screen. As a 14-year-old red guard during the Cultural Revolution, Chen denounced his father for creating subversive art. While his father forgave him, Chen has found it hard to truly forgive himself. ""I knew it was the wrong thing to do. If I didn't know, then I could've forgiven myself,"" he told CNN. Chen has already touched upon such a significant moment in his personal life in his award-winning 1993 film, ""Farewell My Concubine."" It brought him international-acclaim and a host of accolades, including Cannes Film Festival's Palme D'or. Like ""Farewell My Concubine,"" Chen's latest film, ""Forever Enthralled"" (""Mei Lanfang"" in Mandarin), once again delves into the world of Beijing opera, and it has proven to be a hit in China since its release in cinemas in December. However, capturing the Cultural Revolution remains one of Chen's ambitions -- not only to explore the circumstances that colored the relationship with his father but an exploration of a crucial time in Chinese history. ""It's not because I was hurt and so many people hurt that I want to do my revenge. It's not like this. This is the lesson that the Chinese people must learn, no matter what,"" Chen told CNN. ""I hope that my generation of directors or writers could do something to tell people the truth, to tell people what really happened at that time; why a young son of a film director, you know, could denounce his own father, like I did. I was still shocked,"" he said. Now 56 years old, Chen studied at the Beijing Film Academy, directing his first feature film ""Yellow Earth"" in 1984. After the success of ""Farewell My Concubine,"" he eventually took up the offer to direct a Hollywood film in 2002 -- ""Killing Me Softly,"" with Heather Graham and Joseph Fiennes. While failing to impress the critics or register a hit at the box office, Chen remains sanguine about the experience. ""I think I've learnt a lot from that. Although I fully understand why audiences didn't really enjoy that film that much. ""In the industrial system [of Hollywood] people don't really care if you're making a good film or not. People care about whether the film can make money. It's a completely different thing, you know. Quite honestly, I wasn't very comfortable to do films that way,"" said Chen. Chen will continue to make films in China and finds the country's recent transformation as significant as earlier periods of change during his lifetime. ""I ask myself whether it's a progress or we're just going back to where we not necessarily need to be. I don't know. I mean, I'm not trying to say anything politically. But I feel if you look at the very beginning of Charles Dickens' novel, 'A Tale of Two Cities,' 'It was the best times, it was the worst times...' this is the simple answer,"" he said. Time will tell if today's China will be part of Chen's cinematic sweep in the future.","Chinese director Chen Kaige found international fame with 'Farewell My Concubine'

"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama announced Wednesday he would resign after eight months in power. ""I'm going to step down,"" Hatoyama declared in a live broadcast on Japanese television NHK, while addressing party members of both the upper and lower houses of the Diet, Japan's parliament. ""I have had many shortcomings, I have been allowed to lead all of you for the past eight months to today. I am extremely grateful for having been given this opportunity,"" he said. Japanese Finance Minister Naoto Kan said he would run for the party leader election. With overwhelming majority at the lower house of the Diet, the ruling party's leader will certainly become the next prime minister. Eight months ago, Hatoyama 's Democratic Party of Japan won a sweeping victory, an outcome hailed by many as a revolution in Japanese politics. With promises of a cleaner government, Hatoyama worked to shift the political dynamics in Japan by taking away power from the bureaucrats and granting more power to politicians and local governments. In his first speech as Japan's 92nd prime minister, Hatoyama made promises that he would conduct a clean and transparent government, launching a task force to monitor government spending. But soon afterwards, allegations of illegal campaign financing tarnished his administration's image. Some of his cabinet members were investigated for corruption. His approval rating took further hits over his failed promise to move a major U.S. Marine base off Okinawa to ease the burden of the island, which hosts the majority of the United States military presence in Japan. Earlier this month, calling his decision ""heartbreaking,"" he announced that the base would remain on Okinawa, although relocated to a different part of the island. Hatoyama's critics claimed he gave in to U.S. pressure, and his government coalition broke up. Hatoyama said that while he did lose public trust, he hopes future generations will remember his legacy. ""Ladies and gentlemen, I have often been dubbed as an alien and how I understand this is that I see not current Japan but always try to see future Japan,"" he said. ""Local government, local communities should be the main actors,"" said Hatoyama. ""In five or ten years people of Japan will understand what I am talking about."" Parliamentary elections are scheduled to take place in July. The DPJ will now elect a new leader of the party -- most likely on Friday -- who will be in line to be the next prime minister of Japan. Some time early next week, Hatoyama will dissolve his cabinet in the morning and the new party leader will stand for election as new prime minister by both upper and lower houses of parliament. CNN's Yoko Wakatsuki and Kyung Lah contributed to this report.","NEW: Finance Minister says he will run for open seat .

Nigel Farage, 45, suffered minor head injuries and was being treated at a hospital, his party said. Details of his injuries were not available. ""We've had unconfirmed reports that either the banner got snagged up or there were cross-winds and it was an unfamiliar airfield to the pilot,"" a UKIP spokesman said. It happened just after 8 a.m. (3 a.m. ET) at an airfield in southern Northamptonshire, near the Buckinghamshire constituency where Farage is running for election, Northamptonshire police said.

"(CNN)  -- A national campaign to inoculate tens of millions of Americans against H1N1 influenza began Monday, with health care workers in Indiana and Tennessee targeted as the first recipients, federal health authorities said. Health care workers in Indiana and Tennessee are among the first to receive the H1N1 vaccine Monday. ""I think the world has watched history unfold,"" Dr. Judy Monroe, Indiana's state health commissioner, told reporters at Wishard Hospital in Indianapolis. Earlier Monday, the hospital received a shipment of 52 boxes -- each containing 100 pre-filled sprayers. ""This first 5,200 doses that came to Marion County is really just the tip of the iceberg,"" Monroe said. Health Director Virginia Caine said the shipment will be split among the county's hospitals. A similar scene unfolded at LeBonheur Children's Medical Center in Memphis, Tennessee, where three children have died from H1N1, sometimes referred to as swine flu. Jennilyn Utkov, a spokeswoman for LeBonheur, said the hospital received about 100 doses. By noon, the supply had been depleted. The vaccines shipped to both sites and to a few other places around the nation are the first of some 195 million doses the U.S. government has purchased from five vaccine manufacturers, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Dr. Jay Butler told reporters at the Indianapolis event. That number includes both spray and injectable forms. Butler, who heads the agency's 2009 H1N1 Vaccine Task Force, has promised there will be enough for anyone who wants it. Butler said vaccine makers will ship 10 million to 20 million doses per week over the next couple of months. ""Is that fast enough?"" he asked. ""No, but it's what's feasible. It's what can be done."" Monroe predicted that an ample supply of the injectable form will be available by mid-October. Last week, the CDC said it had received reports of 60 deaths of children related to H1N1 flu since April; 11 of those deaths were reported last week alone. From August 30 until September 26, the agency tallied 16,174 hospitalizations nationwide and 1,379 deaths associated with influenza virus infection. iReport.com: How should H1N1 be handled? The 27 states reporting widespread flu activity are Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, Tennessee, Virginia, Washington and Wyoming.  Track the H1N1 virus » . Nearly all of the viruses identified so far are H1N1, the agency said in a posting on its Web site. ""These viruses remain similar to the virus chosen for the 2009 H1N1 vaccine"" and remain susceptible to antiviral drugs ""with rare exception,"" it added. Those who are at the highest risk of getting seriously ill -- pregnant women, children, young adults and people with chronic lung disease, heart disease or diabetes -- should be among the first to get vaccinated against the H1N1 flu virus, health officials have said.  Understanding the H1N1 virus » . According to a CNN/Opinion Corp. poll in late August, two-thirds of Americans said they plan to be vaccinated against H1N1 flu. Health care workers may not necessarily be foremost among them. In the past, about 40 percent of health care workers have opted to be vaccinated against the flu, according to the CDC. Health officials also have recommended people reduce their chances of getting sick by washing their hands frequently, sneezing into a tissue or sleeve rather than into one's hand and staying home when sick. More than 340,000 laboratory-confirmed cases of H1N1 and more than 4,100 deaths have been reported to the World Health Organization. Many countries -- including the United States -- have stopped counting cases, particularly of milder illness, meaning that the true number is likely much higher.","NEW: Makers will ship 10 million to 20 million doses per week in next few months .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The former parents-in-law of a man accused of killing nine people at a Christmas Eve party were among the remains of six people identified Saturday by the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office. Bruce Jeffrey Pardo went on a shooting rampage in a Los Angeles suburb Christmas Eve, police say. Three other people remain listed as ""missing"" and ""unidentified"" because their remains were too badly burned in the raging house fire that followed the shootings. Police said Bruce Jeffrey Pardo committed suicide after he went on a shooting rampage dressed as Santa Claus at the party in the Los Angeles suburb of Covina. He targeted his ex-wife, 43-year-old Sylvia Pardo, and her family, police said. He then started the fire, police said. Authorities said Pardo also may have planned to kill his wife's divorce attorney as well as his own mother, who had planned to attend the party but did not because she was ill. Killed at the party, according to the coroner's office, were: . The remaining three people known to be at the party -- Sylvia Pardo; her brother James ""Junior"" Ortega, 52; and Michael Ortiz, 17, Sylvia Pardo's nephew and Alicia Ortiz's son -- remain listed as ""unidentified"" in coroner's files and ""missing"" in police files. ""We have three unidentified bodies that came out of that location,"" said Lt. Larry Dietz of the coroner's office. Authorities previously said they were relying on dental records to identify the bodies. After the shootings, Bruce Pardo left a rental car and a gasoline canister outside the home of attorney Scott Nord, who represented Sylvia Pardo in her divorce, police said. Investigators suspect that Bruce Pardo planned a similar attack at Nord's home. Authorities described the Pardos' divorce, which was finalized December 18, as ""contentious."" Another rented car that Bruce Pardo used to flee the scene was found booby-trapped after the shootings. It burned as a Covina police bomb squad attempted to disconnect an explosive device in it. Police said Bruce Pardo had an uneasy relationship with his mother, who had sided with Sylvia Pardo in the divorce. The shootings and fire left 10 children orphaned. Three others lost one parent. An Ortega Family Fund has been set up at Nord's law offices. CNN's Irving Last contributed to this report.","Six of nine bodies found in house identified by coroner .

"JERUSALEM (CNN) -- Citing security concerns, the U.S. State Department has revoked the visas it recently issued to three Gaza students who were awarded Fulbright scholarships to study in the United States. Sari Bashi, who advocates freedom of movement for Palestinians, says their access to education is restricted. It marks the second time in two months that the United States has gone back on its offer to the Palestinian students to take part in the American government-sponsored scholarship program. The three students who had their visas revoked were sent a letter from the American Consulate in Jerusalem, dated August 4. ""The Department of State has revoked your nonimmigrant visa"" because ""information has come to light that you may be inadmissible to the United States and ineligible to receive a visa under Section 212 (A) (3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which prohibits issuance of a visa to aliens for security and related grounds,"" the letter said. The letter did not elaborate on what the security concerns were. A State Department official told CNN that the agency could not disclose any information about the reason for the visa revocation, but that the students would be allowed to reapply for a visa at some point in the future. The three students are among seven Gaza-based Fulbright scholars who made headlines when in May the State Department sent them e-mail notifications saying their scholarships could not be completed because the Israeli government would not issue them exit visas from Gaza. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack admitted that the U.S. authorities had not taken up the matter with Israel until after the matter became public. The scholarships were only reinstated after Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice expressed her unhappiness with the situation and the State Department spokesman admitted that a ""faulty decision-making process"" led to the communication. According to Sari Bashi, the executive-director of Gisha, an Israeli non-governmental organization that advocates freedom of movement for Palestinians and has been working closely with the students, four of the seven Fulbright students were cleared for travel out of Gaza by Israel, but the remaining three were prevented from leaving Gaza by the Israeli government, citing security concerns. In an unusual move, the American Consulate in Jerusalem processed the remaining three students' visa applications with mobile fingerprinting equipment at the Israel- Gaza border and granted the visas three weeks later at the end of July. Bashi said on Tuesday that one of the three students, Fidaa Abed, had already left Gaza for the United States and upon arrival at the airport in Washington was informed that his visa had been revoked and was sent back to Amman, Jordan, with instructions to return to Gaza. The other two Fulbright students remain in Gaza. Bashi said that while the situation of the three students is one of ""tremendous concern,"" it only underscores what she says is the larger problem of lack of access to higher education for hundreds of Gaza students who have been accepted into universities outside of Gaza but are prevented from leaving due to Israeli restrictions. Bashi said that ""alongside the few students denied visas for procedural, technical, or undisclosed security reasons, there are hundreds of students with valid visas in danger of losing their places at foreign universities because Israel refuses to even consider their requests to leave Gaza. ""Denying talented young people their right to access education does not contribute to building a better future in the region,"" Bashi said. Israeli government officials have long maintained that its restrictions on allowing students to travel outside of Gaza are based only on security considerations. ""We do act to facilitate students wishing to study at Western universities where they are exposed to liberal and democratic values,"" an Israeli government official said on Tuesday. But, the official said, Israel distinguishes between students wanting to study in the West and those wanting to study in places like Pakistan, Saudi Arabia or Syria or the West Bank. In the case of the West Bank, the official said Hamas could use this as a way of strengthening its activist base in the West Bank, which would be detrimental to Israel's security. ""There is no reason why we should do that,"" the Israeli official said. On the matter of the three students, the official said: ""The process of Israeli-American contacts on the matter did not cease, and more specific information was provided.""","U.S. State Department cites security concerns as reason visas were withdrawn .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Jesse James' Nazi hat was a gift from a Jewish mentor and does not make him a neo-Nazi, his lawyer said Wednesday. James is at a treatment facility ""to deal with personal issues"" in a bid to save his marriage to actress Sandra Bullock, a spokeswoman for James said. ""He realized that this time was crucial to help himself, help his family and help save his marriage,"" she said. A photo recently surfaced of James wearing the German Nazi hat as he raised his right arm in a salute. The hat may have been in poor taste, but it was given to James as a gag gift by his Jewish godfather, attorney Joe Yanny said. Possessing Nazi memorabilia does not make someone a neo-Nazi, he said. As evidence that James is no anti-Semite, Yanny said James lived for nearly a month in an Israeli kibbutz. His lawyer would not disclose what kind of treatment the famous motorcycle designer is seeking. ""I would request that his rights in regards to privacy and his medical matters be respected,"" said Yanny. James has been the target of controversy and publicity since his separation with Bullock soon after she won a best actress Oscar earlier this month. Yanny refused to talk about the condition of the James-Bullock marriage, which came under question when several women went public with claims they were involved with him. ""I understand people's desire in newsworthy stories, but I would hope that by now this wasn't such a newsworthy story such that his basic rights and privacy aren't continuously invaded in an improper manner,"" Yanny told CNN.

"(CNN) -- ""Gossip Girl"" actor Chace Crawford was arrested on a marijuana charge in his hometown Plano, Texas, early Friday morning, police said.

The charge carries a maximum of 180 days in jail and a $2,000 fine, although a first offender can usually expect a year or less probation, according to Texas criminal lawyer George Reul. Jail time is rare in such cases, he said. Many defendants get ""deferred adjudication,"" under which they are not technically convicted and it is removed from their criminal record if they successfully complete probation, Reul said.

"(CNN) -- Gordon Gekko-inspired suspenders may have faded from Wall Street and lunch isn't for wimps anymore, but if there's one thing that hasn't changed in the last two decades it's this: greed is good. With his new film director Oliver Stone is back to exposing financial chicanery, this time showcasing how complex and unfettered the system has become since his 1987 hit film ""Wall Street."" What did he find when he returned to the scene after more than two decades? After years of bank deregulation, Wall Street ""got ridiculous, and I mean it's insane. It became a financial casino,"" he told CNN. That outrageous environment serves as the backdrop for ""Wall Street 2: Money Never Sleeps,"" a follow-up film which, amid massive bank bailouts, sweeping financial reform in Washington and investigations into the practices of Wall Street's leading firms, couldn't be more timely. In the movie, Michael Douglas reprises the role of corporate shark Gordon Gekko. Fresh out of prison, he finds himself in a new financial era dominated by complex products and securities. ""Money Never Sleeps,"" which is slated for release in September, is a ""bookend"" rather than a sequel, to the 1987 film, Stone says. Stone, whose father worked on Wall Street as a broker, set out to tell a morality tale about excess in the original film, with Gekko positioned as the bad guy. But judging by the recent financial crisis, not many Wall Streeters took Stone's message to heart. Instead of being seen as a villain in the 1980s, Gekko became a paragon of success for a generation of traders and business school graduates. Douglas, who won a Best Actor Oscar for the first ""Wall Street,"" said he's always surprised at the reaction MBA students have to Gekko, the suspender-sporting character out to win at all costs. ""They would come up to me and say, 'Hey Gordon, he's the man,'"" he told CNN at Cannes, where the film premiered earlier this month. ""And probably a lot of those guys...are heading up investing banking companies now,"" he said. In the follow up film, Gekko is looking to get back into the Wall Street game and finds a way through his estranged daughter's boyfriend, a young investment banker played by Shia LaBeouf. Joining the cast, which includes Susan Sarandon and Josh Brolin, was like ""stepping into a cage of lions,"" LaBeouf said. ""I felt like an underdog coming onto this set. I'm the 'Transformers,' kid. It's just like, it's daunting."" LaBeouf and Carey Mulligan, who plays Gekko's daughter, play a young couple with ideals. (The couple has also been linked together offscreen.) But their integrity is tested and ""everybody has double motives,"" Stone said. A director known for offering provocative viewpoints, particularly in political films like ""W,"" ""JFK"" and ""Nixon"" -- his next film, ""South of the Border,"" is about Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez -- Stone initially wasn't interested in telling another story about Wall Street. When the producer of the original film and 20th Century Fox made a deal for a follow up film, Stone wasn't on board. ""I didn't event want to do a sequel and I turned them down,"" he said. What changed? The financial meltdown of 2008, which unleashed the worst crisis since the Great Depression and caused the economy to suffer in Stone's words, a ""triple bypass heart attack."" The financial crisis ""was an event of monumental importance socially, economically, for the United States,"" he said. ""It wasn't a perfect storm, it was a systematic breakdown that was due because it's the way the system is run."" While the director certainly harbors strong feelings about the financial system, he also had his fun with the film. He appears briefly, as does Charlie Sheen, who played Gekko's protégé Bud Fox in the first film. ""I was having fun, you have to have fun,"" Stone said. Just like the original ""Wall Street,"" ""you have to take this with a grain of salt because it's so depressing otherwise."" Mulligan says the film is first and foremost an entertaining story. ""It's really about people enjoying it as a movie,"" she told CNN. ""Because it's not just a lesson in finance, it's love stories and rivalries and a brilliant villain in the middle of it.""","""Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps"" is the follow up Oliver Stone's 1987 hit film ""Wall Street""

"(CNN) -- A part-time actor has been accused of killing his neighbor and then luring the victim's friend to her death in an attempt to cover up his crime, authorities in California said. The Costa Mesa Police Department last week charged Daniel Wozniak, 27, with two counts of murder. Wozniak is being held without bail and will be arraigned June 25, said Farrah Emami, spokesperson for the Orange County District Attorney's Office. Wozniak has been accused in the shooting death of Samuel Herr, 26, and Juri Kibuishi, 23, of Irvine, police said. According to investigators, Wozniak and Herr, who lived in the same residential complex in Costa Mesa, drove to the Los Alamitos Joint Forces Training Base on Friday, May 21. It is at the base that Wozniak shot and killed Herr for financial gain, police said. The suspect cut off Herr's head, left arm and right hand and discarded the body parts at a park in Long Beach, police said. After the slaying, Wozniak used Herr's cell phone to text Kibuishi and arrange for her to come to Herr's apartment, investigators alleged. Shortly after midnight on May 22, Kibuishi arrived at the Herr's home, where she was shot and killed by Wozniak, police said. ""Wozniak then staged the crime scene to appear as if a sexual assault had occurred by partially removing her clothing,"" police said in a statement. In addition, investigators said a 17-year-old individual was directed by Wozniak to make several ATM withdrawals using Herr's bank card. Several law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, have been assisting the Costa Mesa Police. From April 23 to May 23, Wozniak starred in a local theater's production of the musical ""Nine."" In a statement, the Hunger Artists Theatre Company said, ""We at Hunger Artists are horrified and saddened by the deaths of Juri Kibuishi and Samuel Eliezer Herr.  Our hearts and deepest condolences go out to their friends and families in this tragic time.""","Part-time actor Daniel Wozniak, 27, is charged with two counts of murder .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Actor Dennis Hopper died at his home in Venice, California, Saturday morning, his wife said. He was 74. Hopper, who was diagnosed with prostate cancer in October 2009, was surrounded by his children when he died, Victoria Hopper told CNN. While funeral arrangements have not been decided, Hopper's wish was to be buried in Taos, New Mexico, his wife said. She said Taos was ""his heart home."" Hopper and his wife were involved in a highly public and bitter divorce fight in the last months of his life. The actor made his last public appearance on March 26, when his star was dedicated on Hollywood's Walk of Fame. ""I just want to thank you,"" Hopper said, as he smiled broadly.""That's all I can do."" With his 6-year-old daughter, Galen, by his side, Hopper waved and bowed to hundreds of fans lining a barricade along Hollywood Boulevard. Hopper's lawyer argued in the divorce case that his estranged wife's presence was hampering his fight with cancer, but the judge allowed her to continue living in the family's Venice compound with their 6-year-old daughter, Galen. His lawyer said Hopper was too ill to attend a divorce hearing, but his older children, an 18-year-old son and two adult daughters, sat in a back row of the courtroom. iReport: Hopper became honorary mayor in 2009 . Hopper's acting career has spanned almost six decades. In the 1950s, he had roles in several TV shows and films, including ""Rebel Without a Cause"" (1955) and ""Giant"" (1956). He became a Hollywood sensation for ""Easy Rider,"" the 1969 film he directed and co-wrote in which he played a dissolute, counter cultural biker. He was twice nominated for Oscars.","Hopper was surrounded by his children when he died, his wife said .

"Washington (CNN) -- The United States was identified Wednesday as the world's No. 1 user of targeted killings -- largely as a result of its dependence on unmanned drone attacks in Pakistan and Afghanistan. A report released by the United Nations called the drone attacks part of a ""strongly asserted but ill-defined license to kill without accountability"" and warned that they are contributing to an erosion of longstanding international rules governing warfare. It urged states to identify publicly the rules of international law believed to provide a basis for any attempted targeted killings as well as the rationale for deciding to kill instead of capture individuals. ""The rules being set today are going to govern the conduct of many states tomorrow,"" said New York University law professor Philip Alston, the report's author. ""The international community needs to be more forceful in demanding accountability."" Alston, who also works for the U.N. Human Rights Council, said roughly 40 countries possess drone technology, and many of them either already have or attempting to acquire the capability to launch missiles from drones. ""I'm particularly concerned that the United States seems oblivious to this fact when it asserts an ever-expanding entitlement for itself to target individuals around the globe,"" he said. This ""ill-defined license to kill without accountability is not an entitlement which the United States or other states can have without doing grave damage to the rules designed to protect the right to life and prevent extrajudicial executions."" In the eight years of George W. Bush's presidency, unmanned aircraft -- or drones -- attacked militant targets 45 times. Since President Barack Obama took office, the numbers have risen sharply: 53 last year and 39 so far this year in Pakistan alone, according to the New America Foundation, a Washington foreign policy think tank. While the United States is the only country in the region of Pakistan and Afghanistan known to have the ability to launch missiles from drones -- which are controlled remotely -- U.S. officials normally do not comment on suspected drone strikes. The report distinguishes between drone attacks conducted by the Pentagon and those launched by the CIA.  The U.S. military has a ""relatively public accountability process,"" Alston said. But CIA attacks reponsible for the deaths of ""many hundreds of people ... remain shrouded in official secrecy."" ""The international community does not know when or where the CIA is authorized to kill, the criteria for individuals who may be killed, how it ensures killings are legal, and what follow-up there is when civilians are illegally killed,"" he said. Alston, who backs an end to CIA drone attacks, argued that ""intelligence agencies, which by definition are determined to remain unaccountable except to their own paymasters, have no place in running programs that kill people in other countries."" He also blasted U.S. officials for embracing what he characterized as an ""expansive and open-ended interpretation of the right of self-defence.""  The current U.S. stance ""goes a long way towards destroying the prohibition on the use of armed force contained in the U.N. Charter,"" he asserted. The report cited two key issues: ""excessively broad circumstances"" under which targeted killings are deemed to be legal, and the lack of accountability when they are used. Alston conceded the conflict with al Qaeda and other extremist organizations pose a unique challenge and noted that al Qaeda routinely kills innocent civilians. ""But the fact that such enemies do not play by the rules does not mean that a government can cast those rules aside or unilaterally re-interpret them,"" he said. ""The credibility of any government's claim that it is fighting to uphold the rule of law depends of its willingness to disclose how it interprets and applies the law -- and the actions it takes when the law is broken."" CIA spokesman George Little took issue with Alston's claim of a lack of accountability. ""Without discussing or confirming any specific action or program, this agency's operations unfold within a framework of law and close government oversight,"" he said.  ""The accountability's real, and it would be wrong for anyone to suggest otherwise."" One U.S. official, who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity because U.S. operations are classified, insisted that the United States is not violating international law. ""The U.N. Charter clearly states that nothing ... shall impair the inherent right of individual or self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a member of the United Nations,"" the official said. ""Militants based in Pakistan regularly attack American and coalition forces in Afghanistan. The United States and its allies have a right and responsibility to protect themselves against dangerous enemies. The United States has an 'inherent right' to protect itself, and we will not refrain from doing so based on an exceptionally narrow -- and faulty -- definition of self-defense."" The official said the United States has Pakistani cooperation in ""conducting precise actions to take dangerous figures off the battlefield.  And we do so with an absolute commitment to minimize non-combatant casualties and property damage."" ""The precision is unsurpassed in the history of human conflict,"" the official said. ""No one's come up with a better alternative, assuming they see value in trying to stop killers like al Qaeda and the Pakistani Taliban. This is a policy of legitimate and lawful self-defense, driven by absolute necessity."" CNN's Alan Silverleib and Pam Benson contributed to this report.","NEW: A U.S. official insisted the United States is not violating international law .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Just blocks from where U.N. diplomats debate their interpretations of tyranny and democracy, what may be the first document to articulate the difference is going up for sale. The version of the Magna Carta up for auction has been on display at the National Archives in Washington. Sotheby's will auction off one of the earliest versions of the Magna Carta later this year, the auction house announced Tuesday. This will be the first time any version of the Magna Carta has ever gone up for auction, according to David Redden, vice chairman of Sotheby's. The Magna Carta is expected to fetch at least $20 million to $30 million, Redden said. Redden, who has also sold dinosaur bones, space race artifacts and a first printing of the Declaration of Independence, called the Magna Carta ""the most important document on earth."" The charter mandated the English king to cede certain basic rights to his citizens, ensuring that no man is above the law. Many believe the Magna Carta was the first document to recognize the legal right to freedom from tyranny, an influential concept to American political philosophers -- from the founding fathers to the modern presidency. The version to be auctioned is one of fewer than 20 known copies of the Magna Carta, which means ""Great Charter"" in Latin. The document was first devised in 1215, but not confirmed into English law until 1297 -- the year this version was issued and sealed by King Edward I. The document is one of only two copies of the charter that exist outside of England, according to Sotheby's. This Magna Carta and another version in Australia are the only two ever to have been privately sold. The version up for auction rested for six centuries with the Brundell family in Deene Park, England, until being bought in 1984 by businessman Ross Perot. Since then, the Perot Foundation has kept the copy on display at the National Archives in Washington. The Perot Foundation plans to distribute the money from the auction to various causes such as medical research and helping wounded soldiers. The Magna Carta will be coming up for auction during the week of December 10. E-mail to a friend .","Sotheby's to auction one of the earliest versions of the Magna Carta .

"Hong Kong, China (CNN) -- They are coming from cities across China, including Beijing and Shanghai: . Students are leaving mainland China for the opportunity to study in Hong Kong instead. ""We are a small elite who can afford freedom beyond China's great firewall,"" says ""Li Cheng"" from Shanghai. Li, a student at the University of Hong Kong, did not want to disclose his real name or details about his study program, fearing consequences back home. ""I live in one country, but it feels like having two identities,"" Li said.  ""In Shanghai, I use special software to access sites blacklisted by the government, like Twitter or the uncensored version of Google. ""In Hong Kong, I am taught to integrate these tools in my research."" In the past, students such as Li would have to travel to far-away countries to get around Beijing's control of information. Now, they are taking advantage of Hong Kong's special administrative status that allows for a ""one country, two systems"" rule until 2047. Hong Kong is nothing like mainland China in terms of its free flow of information, freedom of speech and multiparty political system. Those differences were recently emphasized by Google's row with the Chinese government over censorship. In March, Google announced it was routing its users to an uncensored version of the internet search engine based in Hong Kong, amid speculation that Google would pull out of China entirely. China's reaction to Google's announcement . ""When Google redirected its site from China to Hong Kong, it meant a lot of publicity for our free harbor,"" said David Bandurski, a China analyst at the University of Hong Kong (HKU). He studies censorship issues. ""[Google's] move has emphasized Hong Kong's significance in China, benefiting from the rule of law and its potential as a free information hub."" Many young Chinese have explored that hub since 1997 when the the British colony was handed over to China, paving the way for Chinese from the mainland to apply to universities in Hong Kong. The influx of students applying from the mainland created fierce competition to enter Hong Kong's top universities. The number of mainland Chinese applying for HKU's undergraduate program has increased more than tenfold in the past decade. In 2008, some 12,000 mainlanders applied for the 300 slots that HKU reserves for students from mainland China. Li Cheng said he considers himself very lucky to be studying in Hong Kong . ""Free access to information is a need and a privilege,"" he said. The influx of talent such as Li could signify a brain drain for mainland China, according to Bandurski. ""Without political reform, economic growth in China will decline,"" he said. ""Talents will leave China. Students and teachers who want to have more access to information are not dissidents anymore. They are becoming the mainstream."" Asia's top five universities are now located in Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan -- outstripping their rivals in mainland China -- according to a recent ranking of QS, a higher education information network company. The top mainland school was Peking University in Beijing in 12th place, down from its previous ranking of 10. See Asian university rankings . The data show that ""the tide has turned,"" according to Paul Denlinger, an internet consultant based in Hong Kong and Beijing. ""During the dotcom era [of the 1990s], head-hunters were looking for talent from universities in Shanghai and Beijing,"" Denlinger said. ""Now they are coming to Hong Kong."" With new freedom at hand, only a few fresh HKU graduates have returned to the mainland.  Last year, only 3 percent of HKU graduates from mainland China returned home to look for a job. That matches the trend of Chinese students studying overseas. More than 70 percent of the more than 1 million Chinese students abroad did not return home after graduation between 1978 and 2006, according to a report by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences . Aware of this brain drain, the Chinese government has recently introduced a plan to attract highly qualified students back to the mainland promising better living standards, including favorable access to medical care. But that hasn't tempted Li Chang who, like many of his friends, wants to stay in Hong Kong. ""I love my country, but I don't want to give up on my right to access information,"" he said.","More students are leaving mainland China to study in Hong Kong universities .
Some say it's because of the government's restrictions to the internet .
Many who leave mainland China to study elsewhere never return .
China is trying to lure highly qualified students  back by promising better living standards ."
"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- In an attempt to re-create the experience of a manned mission to Mars, an international team of researchers will lock themselves up in a windowless capsule for about a year and a half -- time required for a round trip to the Red Planet. Starting Thursday, an all-male ""crew"" of six -- three Russians, a Frenchman, an Italian-Colombian and a Chinese -- will spend 520 days in the cramped and claustrophobic conditions of a special facility in Moscow and will follow a strict regimen of exercise and diet. Organizers at the European Space Agency and Russia's Institute of Biomedical Problems hope the project will shed light on the physical and psychological effects of the long isolation that future Mars astronauts will experience. ""This study is not useful only for Mars, but also for life on Earth,"" 27-year-old Diego Urbina, the Italian-Colombian participant, said in a news release. The researchers will communicate with mission control via the internet, with occasional disruptions and a 20-minute delay to imitate the effects of space travel. They will perform tasks similar to astronauts at the international space station, such as maintenance and scientific experiments, but for a longer period of time. They will follow a seven-day week with two days off, except when special and emergency situations are simulated. The latest isolation test is the last and longest part of the Mars500 experiment that began in 2007. The first phase was a 14-day simulation that mainly tested the facilities and operational procedures. The second phase followed in 2009, when four Russian and two European crew members were shut into the facility for 105 days. Missions to the Red Planet have thus far been unmanned. In January, NASA told CNN Radio that the agency was close to a deal to merge its Mars program with the European Space Agency's, a big step toward manned missions. In the meantime, NASA is preparing for the launch of its newest robotic space exploration vehicle, the Mars Science Laboratory, late next year. It weighs roughly one metric ton and is about the size of a small automobile.","Mars500 team to be locked up in a windowless capsule for about a year and a half .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A Mexican judge has issued an arrest warrant for reality TV producer Bruce Beresford-Redman in the death of his wife at a Cancun resort in April, his lawyer said Monday. ""We have been advised that Mexican authorities have issued a warrant for the arrest of Bruce Beresford-Redman in connection with the murder of his wife, Monica,"" defense lawyer Richard Hirsch said Monday. ""This news, if true, is extremely disturbing since it appears that this case is being handled in a manner outside the normal procedures in Mexico."" The prosecutor in Mexico had said earlier Monday he had developed a ""very concrete, very specific"" case that was sent to a judge Friday for consideration of charges. Quintana Roo Attorney General Francisco Alor said through a spokesman that the investigation file, with recommended charges, was sent to the judge on Friday. ""It is our understanding that the issuance of an arrest warrant normally entails a detailed judicial review that takes anywhere from several weeks to several months,"" Hirsch said. ""It appears that the way this matter is being handled constitutes a rush to judgment."" Bruce Beresford-Redman was briefly detained after Monica Beresford-Redman's body was found in a sewer at the Moon Palace Resort on April 8. His passport was taken by investigators and he was told not to leave Mexico until the probe was concluded. The former producer on TV's ""Survivor"" recently returned to his Los Angeles, California, home, to take care of family business and see his two young children, his lawyer said. His lawyer issued a statement from Beresford-Redman Monday after learning of the arrest warrant. ""I am devastated at her loss,"" Beresford-Redman said in the statement, ""and I am incensed at the suggestion that I could have had anything to do with her death. I am innocent. My children have had one parent taken from them by a senseless act of violence. I implore the Mexican authorities not to take their remaining parent by a miscarriage of justice and to do what is right, not just what is expedient."" Hirsch said Friday that there should not be ""a rush to judgment,"" adding that there have been other unsolved deaths and an attack at the resort. He cited the death of an elderly Scottish woman, who was found in a swamp weeks after leaving a pool for a walk, and a Canadian man who allegedly fell from a hotel balcony. Jeff Toews, a Canadian, was found dead in May 2007. Investigators decided he died from a drunken fall from a balcony, but his family did not accept that explanation. Julia Howard, a 77-year-old woman from Scotland, was found dead in a dense swamp six weeks after disappearing from a pool area last summer. Her family also rejected the police conclusion that her death was an accident. A woman reported an attempted rape in her hotel room ""several days after Mrs. Beresford-Redman's body was discovered,"" Hirsch said. ""We have brought this to the attention of the authorities and, in particular, to the attorney general in Cancun and asked them to pursue all leads before making a decision whether of not to charge our client,"" Hirsch said. ""We feel that this case should not be a rush to judgment."" ""There are strange things going on -- I think that need to be pursued,"" he said. A spokeswoman for the resort directed CNN to a Mexican news report that quoted the prosecutor saying there was no connection between other deaths and the Beresford-Redman case. The initial investigation suggested Monica Beresford-Redman ""died of strangulation, because of the bruising,"" Mexican regional police spokesman Adrian Cardena said. A source close to the wife has told CNN that she cleaned out the family bank account and took her two children to Hawaii because she was upset about her husband's extramarital affair. The couple later traveled to Cancun in an effort to repair their marriage, the source said. A Los Angeles judge decided Friday that the children, ages 3 and 5, could not attend a memorial service organized Sunday by Monica Beresford-Redman's sisters because a therapist said it might be emotionally harmful to them. ""We respect the decision of the court, but we are very disappointed the fact that the children were denied to participate in the celebration of their mother's life,"" Jeane Burgos said. The sisters are fighting Beresford-Redman for custody of the children. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff delayed any decision on changing the current custody arrangement. Beresford-Redman's parents were given temporary custody in April after he was told by Mexican police to remain in the country while they investigated. He filed papers for custody to be returned to him last week. Bruce Beresford-Redman built his career as a Hollywood reality television show producer. He worked for several seasons on the popular CBS show ""Survivor,"" in which contestants compete against each other in a variety of extreme outdoor scenarios. He was nominated for three Emmy Awards as a producer on the show and was last credited as a producer in 2004. He also worked on NBC's ""The Contender"" and ""The Restaurant,"" as well as MTV's ""Pimp My Ride,"" according to entertainment media company IMG. Monica Beresford-Redman, a native of Brazil, owned a restaurant in Los Angeles. CNN's Rosalina Nieves contributed to this report.","Mexican judge issues arrest warrant for TV producer in wife's death .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Seven insurgents were killed when a group of more than a dozen men launched an early morning attack on Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan on Wednesday, officials said. Army spokesman Lt. Col. Clarence Counts said that five service members were wounded in the attack and a building suffered minor damage. He said the attack included rockets, small arms and grenades. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid told CNN that 20 armed men wearing suicide vests stormed the base around 4 a.m. (7:30 p.m. Tuesday ET), with four of them detonating explosives at the entrances to allow the other men to move in. Mujahid said that a ""major firefight"" took place inside the base. But Army Specialist Christina Dion, a spokeswoman who both lives an works on the base, told CNN that personnel were ordered to enter bunkers when the base came under attack and were allowed to return to their huts and tents about 90 minutes later. ""We're always prepared to deal with attacks on our base,"" Counts said. ""The response this morning was immediate."" The fighting eventually tapered off about 7:30 a.m. local time, said NATO spokesman Lt. Col Todd Breasseale. Another Bagram spokeswoman, Maj. Virginia McCabe, could not say if flights into and out of the air base had been stopped and said that authorities are investigating how the incident started. ""Established security procedures are in place,"" she said, adding that personnel with ""mission-essential"" responsibilities were continuing to work. Bagram is a heavily fortified base, its perimeter guarded by high fences and thick, concrete walls. Dion said she didn't believe anyone could have made their way into the main portion of the base. Taliban fighters have lobbed rockets into the base in previous attacks. CNN's Adam Levine and Paula Hancocks contributed to this report.","Five service members hurt, building damaged in attack using rockets, small arms, grenades .

"Peshawar, Pakistan (CNN) -- A 13-year-old Pakistani boy has taken his school to court, challenging his expulsion after he got married. Gherat Khan, a 7th grader at Peshawar Model School, filed a petition with the High Court in the northwest Pakistani city saying the school's principal sent him packing after she found out about the wedding. Gherat said his wife is 16, although CNN could not independently verify her age. Pakistan has no clear guidelines prohibiting underage marriage. Civil law says boys must be 18; girls 16. But Islamic law says a couple can marry if both have reached puberty and if their parents approve. ""I am young but our family had problems,"" Gherat said, explaining why he tied the knot at such an early age. His father had passed away and his mother was sick, he said. The family had fallen on hard times. So his relatives, including his grandfather, decided to find him a bride who could help the family with housework . Gherat said he loves his wife and does not regret his family members' decision. The school, however, felt differently. Principal Beatrice Jamil said the decision to expel Gherat was taken after consulting with the school's directors. His file said the school removed Gherat because his parents removed him. But Jamil admitted that wasn't the real reason. Gherat, she said, was told to leave because the school worried he'd share intimate details of married life with classmates. ""It's prohibited. It's almost taboo,"" she said. Gherat said he was upset when he found out he could no longer attend classes. If the school deems something inappropriate, he won't talk about it with his friends, he said. All he wants is to finish his education so he can become a doctor, Gherat added. ""I want to go to this school,"" he said. For her part, Jamil wishes Gherat well -- but doesn't want him back. ""Especially now that it's publicized,"" she said.","Boy, 13, says school expelled him after finding out he was married .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani officials have detained a 10th person in connection with the investigation into the failed May 1 car bombing of New York's Times Square, a Pakistani intelligence source told CNN Tuesday. The intelligence source, who asked not to be identified because he is not authorized to speak to the media, identified the man as Shoaib Mughal. He is suspected of having served as an intermediary between the bombing suspect, Faisal Shahzad, and the Pakistani Taliban, the source said. Mughal's uncle, who also asked not to be identified, told CNN that Mughal, who is married, owns and operates a computer parts store in Islamabad. The uncle said six men dressed in civilian clothing detained Mughal, who has never been outside Pakistan, at his shop on May 6. In addition, a Pakistani intelligence source told CNN that detainee Muhammad Shahid Hussain was a friend of Faisal Shahzad when the bombing suspect was studying in the United States. The two men met frequently last year, when Shahzad returned to Pakistan, the source said. Hussain's brother, Muhammad Khalid, told CNN that Hussain traveled to the United States in 2000 to participate in an MBA program and remained there until 2004. Hussain's brother and father, Muhammad Ramzan, have denied he has any links to terrorist groups or the attempted bombing in Times Square. The intelligence official added that another suspect, Major Adnan, resigned from the Pakistani Army last year. The official said Adnan contacted Shahzad by e-mail at least once but the official did not disclose when the e-mail was sent or what it contained. This month, a senior administration official said Shahzad, a Pakistani-American, was looking for help from the Pakistani Taliban in carrying out a bomb attack during his last visit to Pakistan. ""The question is: Did he go there looking for help or did he fall in their lap? It seems the former. It appears he went seeking help for this attack,"" the official said. ""He had an attack in mind when he went there."" The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because this person wasn't allowed to speak publicly about the investigation. Top advisers to President Barack Obama said early this month that Shahzad worked with the Taliban movement in Pakistan. ""The evidence that we have now developed shows the Pakistani Taliban directed this plot,"" Attorney General Eric Holder told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on May 9. John Brennan, assistant to the president for counterterrorism and homeland security, told CNN that the Pakistani Taliban -- also known as Tehrik-e-Taliban, or TTP -- is ""closely allied with al Qaeda."" Shahzad was arrested while trying to fly out of New York on May 3, two days after federal authorities say he left a vehicle filled with explosive materials in Manhattan's Times Square. The makeshift bomb failed to detonate. Shahzad had traveled to Pakistan several times in recent years, Brennan said. CNN's Reza Sayah and Nasir Habib contributed to this story.","Pakistani officials detain 10th person accused of link to bomb plot .

"(CNN) -- Some of the first accounts emerged Tuesday from eyewitnesses who were aboard several boats stormed by Israeli forces as they approached Gaza the day before. Hanin Zoabi, a member of the Israeli parliament, was on board the Miva Marmara, the ship that was the scene of a confrontation between activists and Israeli soldiers. That clash left at least nine people dead. The Israeli Navy fired on the ships five minutes before commandos descended from ropes that dangled from helicopters, Zoabi said during a press conference in Nazareth, Israel. She said passengers on board the ship were unarmed. Were you there? Send us your story, images, video . Israel has said its forces found several weapons among the passengers on the Miva Marmara. Israel also has said that its forces started shooting after passengers on the Miva Marmara assaulted them. Zoabi said the military operation lasted about an hour and that she saw five dead bodies in that time. She urged Israeli authorities to investigate and to let the news media interview passengers who have been detained. Zoabi said she believes Israel has video footage of how the ten passengers were killed, and she called on Israeli authorities to release that footage. Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman has said that of the six ships in the flotilla, the people prepared an ambush on one, a reference to the Turkish ship.

"(CNN) -- Greek journalists walked off the job Thursday to protest tough government austerity measures. The reporters are specifically protesting reforms to the country's social security system as called for in the austerity package the government has put together to pull Greece out of debt. Participating in the strike is the Athens News Agency, the national news outlet. During the strike -- which ends Friday morning -- television and radio stations will not broadcast programs, the news agency said. Friday morning papers will also go unprinted. The country has already experienced walkouts by workers' unions in recent weeks. In May, a €110 billion ($145 billion) aid package for Greece was announced. Soon after, Greece's Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou announced tough cost-cutting measures to meet European Union and International Monetary Fund conditions on the deal. The package includes a promise by Greece to cut its budget deficit to three percent of gross domestic product, as required by European Union rules, by 2014, according to Papaconstantinou. The measures, he said, were needed for Greece to secure its financial lifeline. Greece had a choice between ""destruction"" and saving the country, and ""we have chosen of course to save the country,"" Papaconstantinou said.","Journalists in Greece are protesting against planned social security reforms .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- The laser surgery business is booming for treatments like hair, tattoo and wrinkle removal. Julie Pak gets laser treatment from a doctor, eight years after she says she was scarred by earlier treatment. In 2005, the last year recorded, the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery said its members performed nearly 1 million such procedures, about 300,000 more than in 2003. Board certified dermatologists, however, are not the only ones operating lasers on skin. Laser treatments are offered at local beauty salons, and are also a big part of the medical spa industry, which has grown by 160 percent in the last three years, according to the International Medical Spa Association. The association says a medical spa operates under the full-time, on-site supervision of a licensed health care professional. It offers traditional, complementary and alternative health practices and treatments in a spa-like setting. Some doctors are concerned that while these high-tech devices can produce amazing results, in the wrong hands, the outcome can be horrifying. Eight years ago, computer programmer Julie Pak went to her neighborhood salon in Illinois to have the rose tattoo on her back removed, a decision she said that left her not only with physical scars but emotional ones as well. Pak said a laser was used to peel back layers of the tattooed skin. She said she knew the procedure would hurt, but was not prepared for what she experienced --pain that was excruciating ""beyond words."" Watch more on the dangers of illegal laser surgery . ""I was in tears for I believe a week, but certainly while she was doing it I didn't have any anesthesia or anything. She literally had a laser pen and was zapping across my skin,"" she said. And she said the tattoo was only partially removed. The proliferation of medical spas and other clinics offering laser treatments worries the ASDS, which said botched laser skin procedures increased 41 percent from 2005 to 2006. ""We see a definite increase in the number of people being damaged by untrained individuals using these lasers and we think that this is just going to be more of a problem,"" said Alastair Carruthers, president of ASDS. He and other doctors say the increased demand for laser surgery is outpacing the number of people properly trained to use it. ""If you use them inappropriately, you can damage tissue severely. You're trying to damage very selectively, but you can do more than that, so that you can draw a hole in someone if you are being dumb about things,"" he said. ""Sadly, there are many people who are laser techs who have done very little, maybe a weekend course, maybe some other training. We believe that you require more information than that,"" Carruthers said. He thinks a physician should always be present during the procedures and that those performing it should have at least basic knowledge of the response of body tissue to lasers, like a registered nurse or physician's assistant. The ASDS and organizations like the National Coalition of Estheticians, Manufacturers/Distributors & Associations, put the blame squarely on state regulatory boards for what they consider a lack of effective oversight in the industry. Regulation on who can use lasers and what defines ""medical supervision"" differs from state to state. Some states require a doctor on site, others do not. According to the ASDS, Kentucky is the only state that requires a doctor to be present in the room while the procedure is taking place. Only four other states require that a physician be on site and available for consultation during treatments. The rest require less stringent physician involvement -- like simply being available by phone or beeper, for example. ""If we could get a clear definition from the state medical boards as to what medical supervision is, it would make our lives a lot easier and it would keep consumers much safer,"" said Susanne Warfield, executive director of the NCEA. The salon that Pak said disfigured her back eight years ago has gone out of business. Since then, she has thought a lot about warning signs that should have stopped her from going there for laser surgery. For example, a woman at the salon gave her a price quote on the phone. ""I mean, without knowing anything about my medical history, that right there should have immediately been a red flag."" Now, Pak again is enduring painful laser treatments to reduce the scarring and hopefully get rid of the rest of the tattoo . She also tailors her wardrobe to hide the scar. ""Summertime is probably my least favorite season because it's the only time either it's showing or I have to make special efforts to cover it up,"" Pak said. ""Even for my wedding I had a strapless gown, but I had to have a really long veil to cover it up and it was something I was self-conscious about every evening. It affects every day of my life.""

"London (CNN) -- They can fly 300 yards through the air and have helped turn the likes of Tiger Woods into multi-millionaires, but it seems the powers of the golf ball don't end there. For the last few days, BP have been using golf balls in an audacious attempt to plug the disastrous Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, which has been described by the Obama administration as probably ""the biggest environmental disaster"" the country has ever faced. BP press officer Sheila Williams told CNN that the balls had been used part of a ""junk shot"" including shredded tires and knotted rope that were pumped into the well at high pressure to plug the leak. Mud and cement was then injected into the well to keep the junk in place. Williams revealed that this process was carried out ""a number of times"" in conjunction with the U.S. coast guard before the oil giant admitted that the experiment had failed. Golf balls were selected as part of the 'junk shot' because they are small enough to plug gaps between the rope and tires and strong enough to withstand the pressure of the oil which is gushing out with significant force. Whether Titleist, Callaway or any other make (BP were unable to confirm either the brand or numbers used) golf balls are designed to withstand 2,000 pounds of force from a club making them a good candidate to withstand the high pressure oil leak. Engineers first used the 'junk shot' to quell the 1991 Kuwait oil fires but never at such depths. The fact that the Deepwater Horizon leak is 5,000 feet below the surface of the ocean is thought to be the reason the technique did not succeed. ""I don't think we'll be using golf balls again,"" commented Williams. US President Barack Obama said the failure of the earlier ""top kill"" plan was ""heartbreaking"". The spill started over a month ago when the Deepwater Horizon rig caught fire and exploded, killing 11 workers. Over 40 days on and BP have still to stop the leak. BP has spent more than £600m trying to stem the estimated 5,000 barrels of oil per day flowing out from the wellhead. Previous failed attempts have included a coffer dam, a tube to suck the oil up to the surface and top kill. BP will next try to cap the well using an underwater robot that will try to cut the leaking pipe and place a cap over it -- a process known as deploying the Lower Marine Riser Package Cap Containment System. BP said that the cost of tackling the spill had increased to $930 million. The final cost, including legal damages arising from the accident, is still uncertain. The US Government recently released data showing that the oil was leaking at up to 19,000 barrels per day, nearly four times higher than BP's previous estimate of 5,000 barrels. The oil giant initially claimed after the Deepwater Horizon rig sank on April 22 that just 1,000 barrels per day were leaking from the well. The latest figures indicate that between 18.6 million gallons and 29.5 million gallons of crude oil have leaked into the sea, outstripping the 11 million gallons spilled in the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster.","'Junk shot' using golf balls, rope and tires to plug holes in oil well fails.

"Berlin, Germany (CNN) -- German President Horst Koehler resigned suddenly Monday over what he said was heavy criticism about comments he made on Germany's military role in the world, which he said had been misinterpreted. It was the first time in German history that a president has resigned, the government-funded Deutsche Welle news agency reported. Koehler said May 22 upon his return from a trip to Afghanistan that ""in emergencies, military intervention is necessary to uphold our interests, like for example free trade routes, for example to prevent regional instabilities which could have a negative impact on our chances in terms of trade, jobs and income."" He later said he meant the protection of shipping routes along the Gulf of Aden against piracy, for example, and not any reference to Germany's role in Afghanistan. But his comments came in for widespread criticism. Crticis said he was framing Germany's involvement in the Afghan war in economic terms having to do with self-interest, rather than as a duty in fulfilling a NATO mission in the fight against terrorism. Others said his comments indicated he would use the military unconstitutionally and for economic reasons. Germany has 4,500 troops in a NATO-led force fighting a Taliban-led insurgency in Afghanistan. Polls show that most Germans oppose the war in Afghanistan, but the government has not set a date for the withdrawal of troops. Koehler, 67, made the surprise resignation announcement at a televised news conference with his wife standing next to him. He appeared visibly emotional, the Deutsche Welle news outlet reported. ""I am resigning my post as federal president with immediate effect,"" Koehler said. ""It was an honor for me to serve Germany as president,"" he said. ""I thank the many people in Germany who have put their trust in me and supported my work. I ask for you to understand my decision."" The president's office is largely ceremonial. Chancellor Angela Merkel heads the government and holds the real power. Merkel found out about the resignation a short while before Koehler's announcement, Deutsche Welle said. She canceled a trip to northern Italy to visit the training camp of the German national soccer team as the squad prepares for next month's World Cup, the government news agency said. Speaking at a news conference in Berlin, Merkel said she was stunned by Koehler's decision. 'I deeply regret this resignation,"" Merkel said. ""I must add that I of course told him also I respect his decision to resign."" Merkel also said she had ""unsuccessfully tried to get him to change his mind,"" Deutsche Welle said. The resignation comes at an inopportune time for Merkel, whose center-right coalition recently lost an important state election and suffered another resignation of a key ally last week, Deutsche Welle said. The German constitution mandates that the head of the Bundesrat, the upper house of parliament that represents Germany's federal states, will temporarily take over the president's duties. Jens Boehrnsen, the Social Democratic mayor of Bremen, holds the rotating position of Bundesrat leader this year and will assume the president's duties. Boehrnsen will fill in for Koehler until an electoral college, the Federal Convention, elects a successor. The convention must convene within 30 days -- by June 30 in this case. The president in Germany is not elected by the people, but by the Federal Convention. The secret ballot vote is held without prior debate and requires an absolute majority to elect a president. If none of the candidates wins an absolute majority after two rounds of voting, the person with a simple majority in the third round is selected president. The Federal Convention is Germany's largest parliamentary body. All of the members of the lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, can vote. A corresponding number of representatives from the federal states also are entitled to vote. The convention, which had 1,224 members at the time, last met in May 2009 to re-elect Koehler. Koehler, a former managing director of the International Monetary Fund, was first elected president in 2004.","NEW: President's resignation is first in country's history .

"(CNN) -- Five suspected pirates went on trial Tuesday in the Netherlands in what is thought to be the first trial in Europe of pirate suspects. The trial of the five Somali men opened in Rotterdam District Court and is expected to last five days, said Wim de Bruin, a spokesman for Netherlands National Prosecutor's Office. The five were captured by the Dutch Navy in January 2009 in the Gulf of Aden, off Somalia, after a cargo ship with Dutch Antilles flag was attacked, de Bruin said. ""The ship of the pirates was destroyed by the Danish Navy, and the pirates were captured and handed to the Dutch authority. They're being tried for sea robbery, and if convicted the maximum sentence will be 9 to 12 years,"" he said. The men are Ahmed Yusuf Farah, 25, Jama Mohamed Samatar, 45, Abdirisaq Abdulahi Hirsi, 33, Sayid Ali Garaar, 39, and Osman Musse Farah, 32, he said. A different suspected Somali pirate is awaiting sentencing in the United States, where he pleaded guilty earlier this month to hijacking and kidnapping. Prosecutors say Abduwali Abdukhadir Muse led an attack on a U.S.-flagged vessel, the Maersk Alabama, off the coast of Africa last year. He pleaded guilty May 19 in a New York federal court to felony counts of hijacking maritime vessels, kidnapping and hostage taking, for his role in the hijacking of the Maersk Alabama in the Indian Ocean on April 8, 2009. Muse faces a maximum sentence of almost 34 years behind bars when he is sentenced October 19. The suspects being tried in the Netherlands spent four weeks aboard the Danish navy ship after their capture before being taken to the Netherlands, the spokesman said. They were held in pre-trial custody while the court interviewed witnesses from the Danish Navy and seamen on the Dutch Antilles cargo ship that was under attack, he said. Five Dutch defense lawyers are representing the suspects, he said. He did not know what plea, if any, the suspects had entered. Germany will soon try 10 suspected pirates who were captured in the Gulf of Aden earlier this year. They were arrested after their attempt to board a German cargo vessel, but the Danish Navy ended the hijacking and handed them over to the Dutch authorities, de Bruin said. They have since been held in the Netherlands, and Germany requested their extradition about two months ago. CNN's Eileen Hsieh contributed to this report.","Trial of the five Somali men thought to be first of its kind in Europe .

"Washington (CNN) -- The House of Representatives approved a plan Friday that would pave the way for an eventual repeal of the military's controversial ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy, which bars openly gay and lesbian soldiers from military service. The measure passed in a largely party-line, 229-186 vote as part of a larger defense authorization bill despite a growing controversy over allegations of wasteful spending in the legislation. Most Democrats backed the bill while most Republicans opposed it. Attention now shifts to the Senate, where the Armed Services Committee approved a ""don't ask, don't tell"" repeal earlier in the week. As in the House, the committee was divided sharply along partisan lines. The plan is a compromise under which the repeal would occur only after a military review of the question and subsequent approval by Obama, the defense secretary and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Opponents of the repeal language argue the military should first carry out the review ordered by Defense Secretary Robert Gates that is scheduled to be completed in December. Only then would military leaders have the necessary information from force members to develop a plan for carrying out the repeal, they claim. Under the compromise, the military would be given time to complete its review as sought by Gates and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen. Gates and Mullen both said this week they could accept the compromise language. A recent CNN poll seemed to suggest that Americans are ready for the change. The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Tuesday indicated that 78 percent of the public supports allowing openly gay people to serve in the military, with one in five opposed. Threatening to derail the plan, however, is House members' insistence on spending almost $500 million on a fighter engine that neither the White House nor the Pentagon wants. Funding for the engine was included in the House's version of the legislation but not the Senate's. A White House spokesman warned before the House vote on Friday that President Barack Obama would veto the bill if funding for the engine isn't removed. Gates has blasted the proposed funding for the extra F-35 Joint Strike Fighter engine, calling it a ""waste of money"" that doesn't meet the fighter's performance needs. The chairman of the Senate Armed Services committee said Friday that he hopes Obama wouldn't veto the plan if Congress failed to remove the controversial funding. ""It's difficult to believe the president would do anything other than look at the entire bill, not just one provision,"" said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan. Levin wouldn't predict if the engine funding would still be in the bill by the time it reaches Obama's desk. ""We are a long way from having a product,"" he said. ""Some of the things which I would think (Obama) may not like may be dropped along the way."" Supporters of repealing the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy have been pressuring congressional Democrats to act now, fearing the party will lose its House or Senate majority in November's midterm election and be unable to pass the measure afterward. The compromise emerged late Monday from a meeting at the White House involving administration officials, gay rights groups and Pentagon officials, sources told CNN. There were also talks on Capitol Hill involving White House lawyers, Pentagon officials and staff from the offices of influential House and Senate Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the sources added. A senior U.S. military official with direct knowledge of the Pentagon review process told CNN it is well under way, with a survey going out shortly to about 70,000 troops and families to solicit their views. In addition, the official said, town hall meetings already have been held around the country and more are expected, while a website provides a place for troops to write in their views. The military needs until the end of 2010 to figure out how to implement the repeal in terms of housing, medical and marriage benefits, as well as issues involving the reinstatement of gay soldiers previously discharged under the policy, the official said. A major problem might be determining how to reconcile the repeal of ""don't ask, don't tell"" with federal law that defines marriage as between a man a woman, the official added.

"(CNN) -- A North Korean official has questioned South Korea's credibility for its rhetoric and actions over the sinking of a South Korean warship in March, state-run media in North Korea reported Saturday. Maj. Gen. Pak Rim Su lashed out against the South for saying the North Koreans sank the Cheonan warship, a claim fiercely denied by his communist government. He said the evidence produced by South Korea to make its claim has been fabricated. He said South Korea has aggravated what has become a grave situation, and he warned that any accidental confrontation between the countries would result in war, according to an article in the state-run Korean Central News Agency. He cited North Korea's ""nuclear deterrent"" to deal with such situations. Pak spoke at a rare press conference from the country on Friday. He addressed Korean and foreign reporters and representatives of military attaches at foreign embassies and international organizations, the North Korean news agency reported. China, Japan and South Korea plan to discuss the warship's sinking this weekend. Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao has that his country will not defend whoever is responsible for sinking the South Korean warship. He also said that China is not ready to accept South Korea's conclusion that the North is to blame. China meets with South Korea . South Korea says a North Korean mini-sub fired torpedoes at the Cheonan South Korean Navy ship, killing 46 people. Pak says South Korea cooked up the claim, and he called their investigations a farce. He said that the involvement of the United States shows that the probe couldn't be objective. Why are the two Koreas so hostile? Pak said people who disagreed with the investigators' assertions were expelled from the investigation team. He said the changes in investigation results as the case moved forward cast suspicion on the review, according to the state-run news agency's account. For example, the North Koreans say, the warship captain said at first there wasn't outside provocation but later said there was. And they say the military said at first there were no grounds to say it was an attack by the North but later changed that viewpoint. The North Koreans say the South is attempting to undermine efforts to promote reconciliation and North Korea's progress. They argue that the claim has served to rally conservative forces in South Korea and help them politically in upcoming elections.","North Korea denies claim it torpedoed warship .

"Washington (CNN) -- Rep. Edward Markey on Monday challenged the assertion by oil giant BP's chief executive that no underwater oil plumes have formed because of the Gulf of Mexico spill. In a letter to BP, Markey, D-Massachusetts, said scientific evidence showed such plumes have formed and he asked for BP CEO Tony Hayward to provide evidence to back up Hayward's claim Sunday that the spilled oil had gone to the surface. On Sunday, Markey, who heads the House Energy and Environment subcommittee, had accused BP of issuing false statements about the oil spill. ""BP in this instance means 'Blind to Plumes,'"" Markey said in a statement Monday. There was no immediate response from BP. Markey's letter to BP said ""the confirmation of the presence of large quantities of oil sub-surface could help to inform clean-up and response efforts, and it is vital that there is unfettered access to all relevant data or analysis."" The letter noted that University of South Florida researchers recently reported finding a 22-mile-long plume of dispersed oil. In a separate letter Monday to BP, Markey called for complete transparency regarding video feeds of the company's underwater operations. BP is launching a new effort to cut an opening to the leaking equipment so that a containment dome can be lowered on it. ""There cannot be any delay or gaps in our understanding of this situation, given that thousands of barrels of oil are spewing forth each day into the Gulf, with catastrophic long-term consequences,"" said Markey's letter to BP America head Lamar McKay, later adding: ""BP should not be controlling the view the American public has of this disaster in our ocean.""","Rep.

"Washington (CNN) -- If criminal suspects fail to invoke their right to remain silent, they have waived that right, a divided Supreme Court ruled Tuesday. The high court upheld the murder conviction of a man who did not verbally assert his right to remain silent during his police interrogation. In a 5-4 ruling, the court said a suspect must explicitly tell officers he or she is asserting that right, known as Miranda rights. The famous constitutional ""right to remain silent"" and the ""right to talk to a lawyer before answering any questions"" are among the well-known warnings all criminal suspects must be given upon arrest. The conservative court has generally been supportive in recent years, when police challenges to Miranda rights have been raised. ""A suspect who has received and understood the Miranda warnings, and has not invoked his Miranda rights, waives the right to remain silent by making an uncoerced statement to police,"" said Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the court. Van Chester Thompkins was convicted of a January 10, 2000, murder outside a shopping mall in Southfield, Michigan. He fled the scene, but was as arrested about a year later in Ohio. Local police began what turned out to be a three-hour interrogation, with Thompkins at first forced to read aloud part of a copy of ""constitutional rights"" derived from the original Miranda case that went before the Supreme Court in 1966. The five rights included the warning ""anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law,"" and ""the right to decide at any time before or during questioning to use your right to remain silent."" Thompkins refused to sign the form and there was strong disagreement over whether he verbally confirmed he understood them. He remained mostly silent during questioning, but later implicated himself in the shooting. He was later convicted of first-degree murder and other offenses. The court majority sided with the police's version of the events. ""Thompkins did not say that he wanted to remain silent or that he did not want to talk to police,"" Kennedy concluded. ""Had he made either of these simple, unambiguous statements, he would have invoked his 'right to cut off questioning.' Here he did neither, so he did not invoke his right to remain silent."" Kennedy's views were supported by Chief Justice John Roberts, along with Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. A federal appeals court in Cincinnati agreed with Thompkins his confession should be thrown out, but the high court reversed that decision. In a sharp dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor called the court's ruling a ""major retreat"" from protections against self-incrimination guaranteed by the original Miranda ruling. ""Criminal suspects must now unambiguously invoke their right to remain silent -- which counterintuitively requires them to speak,"" she said. ""At the same time, suspects will be legally presumed to have waived their rights even if they have given no clear expression of their intent to do so. Those results, in my view, find no basis in Miranda or our subsequent cases and are inconsistent with the fair-trial principles on which those precedents are grounded."" Sotomayor said the Thompkins ruling ""turns Miranda upside down."" Justices John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer backed her conclusions. Thompkins had implicated himself after police asked if he believed in God. After replying yes, officers then asked, ""Do you pray to God to forgive you for shooting that boy down?"" asking about victim Samuel Morris. The court transcript said Thompkins replied ""Yes,"" and turned away, but later refused to make a written confession. The case is Berghuis v. Thompkins (08-1470).","Court: Suspects who don't explicitly invoke right to remain silent have waived it .

"(CNET)  -- Google's Chrome browser continued to carve away share of worldwide browser usage from rivals in May, new statistics show. Chrome rose 0.3 percentage points to 7.1 percent of share, said Net Applications, which monitors browser usage on a network of Web sites. The statistics reflect activity, not the number of people using a browser, as people load up about 160 million pages each month on sites Net Applications monitors. Because Web usage is increasing, the absolute number of people using a browser can increase even as its fractional share of usage drops. The share losses came from Microsoft's Internet Explorer, which dropped 0.3 percent to 59.7 percent, and Mozilla's Firefox, which dropped 0.2 percentage points to 24.4 percent. Fourth-place Safari from Apple rose 0.1 percentage points to 4.8 percent, and Opera rose 0.1 percentage points to 2.4 percent. The browser market has become hotly competitive with new features being built in to support new Web standards. Even Microsoft, long considered a technology laggard even as its browser dominated, is back in the game with aggresive work developing IE9. Microsoft has been trying to rid the world of Internet Explorer 6, introduced in 2001 and now considered outmoded, slow, and insecure. Even though IE lost share overall, Microsoft can point to progress in upgrading: The various versions of IE8 accounted for 28.9 percent of usage. Meanwhile, another analytics firm, StatCounter, reported IE6 use had dropped below 5 percent in the United States and Europe and to 9.8 percent worldwide. ""At these levels, Web developers now have valid justification not to support IE6 in the future,"" StatCounter Chief Executive Aodhan Cullen said in a statement. The company collected its data from 15 billion page views of Web pages in May. Net Applications also released statistics for iPad use, showing gradual gains since the Apple tablet's release. With the iPad now for sale internationally, usage peaked May 29 with 0.17 percent. Net Applications' data shows the iPad is relatively popular on the weekend. Use generally is lowest as a fraction of browsing on Monday, climbs gradually as the weekdays progress, than roughly doubles on the weekend days. The company also tracked mobile-phone browsing usage. Java ME, a mobile phone version of the technology from Sun Microsystems and now owned by Oracle, took the top spot with 40 percent of usage share. Next in line was iPhone OS with 32.8 percent, Symbian at 14 percent, Android at 6.2 percent, and BlackBerry at 3.6 percent. © 2010 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved.

"(CNN) -- U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said Tuesday the Justice Department has launched a criminal investigation into the massive oil spill spreading through the Gulf of Mexico. Holder said the investigation, which began ""some weeks ago,"" would be comprehensive and aggressive. He promised that the federal officials will prosecute anyone who broke the law. ""We have begun both a criminal as well as a civil investigation as is our obligation under the law,"" Holder said. ""We have what we think is a sufficient case to have begun a criminal investigation."" Holder emphasized that the investigation will cover all aspects of the oil spill, including the deaths of 11 workers in the April 20 explosion and fire on the Deepwater Horizon rig that started the leak. He refused to name any potential targets of the investigation, saying, ""I don't want to unnecessarily cast aspersions."" However, Holder said ""nothing is off the table"" in the probe, and he cited false statements as one of several potential targets of criminal charges. ""This disaster is nothing less than a tragedy,"" Holder said. ""As our review expands in the days ahead, we will be meticulous, we will be comprehensive, and we will be aggressive. We will not rest until justice is done."" Holder stressed that ""anyone found responsible for this spill (must be) held accountable. That means enforcing the appropriate civil -- and if warranted, criminal -- authorities to the full extent of the law."" Among other things, Holder said Justice Department lawyers are examining possible violations of the Clean Water Act and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. He also said prosecutors are looking into potential violations of the Migratory Bird Treaty and Endangered Species Acts, which provide penalties for injury and death to wildlife. BP responded in a statement that it ""will cooperate with any inquiry the Department of Justice will undertake, just as we are doing in response to the other inquires that are already ongoing."" Holder made the announcement during a visit to the Gulf to survey the BP oil spill and meet with state attorneys general and federal prosecutors from Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi, according to the Justice Department. Last month, a group of senators -- including Environment and Public Works Committee Chair Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-California -- sent Holder a letter expressing concerns ""about the truthfulness and accuracy of statements submitted by BP to the government in its initial exploration plan for the site."" They asked the attorney general to investigate possible criminal and civil wrongdoing.

"(CNN) -- What if carbon dioxide were as black as oil? When your house is on fire, you may not be in the mood to hear about an impending cancer epidemic that threatens your neighborhood, so I hesitate to bring up this topic. I have spent my scientific career studying oil spills, including the ongoing disaster in the Gulf of Mexico that killed 11 people in the initial rig blast and is causing epic environmental damage, havoc to lives and livelihoods, political tumult, huge economic losses and an incessant media drumbeat. But while we have readily and rightfully committed ourselves to understanding the cause of the spill, its effects and how to help restore the affected Gulf Coast region, we still can't seem to come to grips with a much more dangerous, far-reaching pollutant that is changing the fundamental chemistry of our entire planet: carbon dioxide. Why the difference in concern? Is it as simple as out of sight, out of mind? We can see oil discoloring the ocean, blackening coastlines and covering wildlife, but carbon dioxide is colorless and odorless. We don't see it, and there's no video or sound bites, so it's easier to deny. CNN and other media outlets do not stream figures about carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. But it has been spewing steadily and increasingly for decades throughout our planet from power plants, factories and our cars and homes. Since 1960, the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has risen from 310 to 390 parts per million. Our eyes are riveted to watching the black trail of oil soiling Gulf waters and coastlines. If carbon dioxide were black, we could actually see our atmosphere darkening with carbon dioxide, creating a heat-trapping blanket that is raising global air and ocean temperatures and threatening to dramatically rearrange our climate. Would we care more if we could see the higher concentrations of carbon dioxide being absorbed into our oceans, making seawater more acidic, endangering coral reefs and marine life and threatening to fundamentally disrupt ocean ecosystems and food webs? Perhaps we ignore carbon dioxide because it's hard for us to think long-term and connect the dots. The consequences of oil spills are immediate; the causes and effects are obvious. Not so with carbon dioxide; its consequences are incremental, insidious and irreversible for centuries to millennia. People don't easily understand how a small sea level rise can result in bigger storm surges and coastal damage, or how slight changes in ocean temperatures can change global rainfall patterns, leading to droughts and floods with catastrophic economic and societal consequences. Even if we acknowledge the problem, there's still the hurdle of doing something about it. It's almost the same as asking, ""If smokers could see their damaged lungs, would they quit more easily?"" Just the way some people blame that problem on tobacco companies for manufacturing the product, it is easier to target blame for oil spills on oil companies. But smokers choose to use cigarettes and often get addicted; similarly all of us who have been afforded the luxuries provided by cheap fossil fuels can't easily make difficult adjustments to wean ourselves away from them. (That doesn't excuse tobacco companies for marketing cigarettes without revealing their dangers or oil companies taking drilling risks without being prepared for the consequences.) The Gulf of Mexico spill is a reminder that oil doesn't come cheap. We will pay an enormous price in cleanup costs, economic losses and environmental and social damage. We don't factor in those costs when we fill our gas tanks. And we don't make the connection that gasoline, once burned, turns into its chemical sibling, carbon dioxide, whose effects on our environment will globally dwarf the catastrophe happening in the Gulf. Few people imagined a catastrophe on such a scale, but we now see it's possible and we are suffering the consequences. Our seemingly invulnerable planet is fragile, too. We ignore that at our peril. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Christopher Reddy.","Christopher Reddy says oil spill is having  devastating effect on the environment .

"Washington (CNN) -- A ""top kill"" method intended to stop the runaway flow of oil in the Gulf of Mexico will likely be tried early next week, BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles said Friday. In the procedure, thick, viscous fluid twice the density of water will be pumped at a high rate into the site of the leak to stop the flow so that it can then be sealed with cement, Suttles said. ""Our best estimate is probably Tuesday,"" he said, noting that the operation has never been tried in such deep water. The timing for the ""top kill"" effort appears to be slipping: BP Managing Director Bo Dudley said Thursday night that the company would try the procedure this weekend. Suttles offered no explanation for the discrepancy. ""We're working very, very hard with BP on the timeline for the 'top kill,' "" said U.S. Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen, national incident commander. ""That's the ultimate near-term solution."" Obama announces oil spill commission . BP is working to assemble ""a massive amount of equipment"" at the site, Suttles said, including three deep-water rigs, drilling rigs, sub-sea support vessels and up to 16 robotic submarines. ""These operations are quite complex, and we won't start the job until all the equipment has been staged and all the equipment is in place,"" he said. But no one expects the effort to solve all the problems associated with the spill. ""We will not rest, even if they secure the flow, even if this 'top kill' is completed successfully next week,"" Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry said. ""We have a long row to hoe"" to ensure that the damage that has already occurred is mitigated. Landry expressed disappointment Friday over BP's efforts to clean up oil on the shores of Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana. Though boom and skimmers had been staged there, ""the folks were hesitating in deploying that,"" she said. Asked to what degree it will be possible to clean oil from the marshes, Allen said that oil in the marshes is ""the worst-case scenario for us to deal with in terms of recovery."" That's because mechanical cleanup can do more harm than good, he said. ""In some cases, burning may be an acceptable solution,"" he said. Any such decision would be made on the scene in consultation with representatives of the state and the parishes involved, he said. But officials had unqualified praise for the weather, which has been cooperating fully in recent days, leaving the seas dead calm. ""These are ideal conditions for skimming,"" Landry said, noting that the percentage skimmed has risen to at least 50 percent from the typical 10 percent. Sub-sea dispersants are also being used, she said, ""so we're not seeing a lot of oil coming to the surface."" On Thursday, the Environmental Protection Agency ordered BP to find a less toxic chemical to break up the oil than the one it has been using, Corexit 9500. The chemical has been rated more toxic and less effective than many others on the list of 18 EPA-approved dispersants, according to testimony at a congressional hearing Wednesday. BP has found no immediate replacement candidate, Suttles said. ""Our analysis that we submitted to EPA last night said there were no other dispersants we could identify that were available and less toxic,"" he said. BP was to meet later Friday with the EPA to discuss alternatives, he said. As the continuing spill enters its second month, debate and concern have focused on just how much oil is spewing from the broken riser a mile below the surface. A federal technical team comprising scientists from the federal government and academia has been charged with estimating the flow rate based on video and other data. The estimate will be peer-reviewed and ""given rigorous oversight by the federal government and academia,"" Landry said. That estimate is likely to be complete ""sometime next week,"" she said. BP has estimated the flow at 5,000 barrels per day, but independent estimates have exceeded that by many times, and Suttles acknowledged Friday that the company's estimate contains ""a huge amount of uncertainty."" The 5,000-barrel figure translates into 210,000 gallons per day. That's 8,750 gallons per hour, 145.8 gallons per minute and 2.4 gallons per second. Suttles said he flew over the region Friday morning and saw no oil close to the coasts of Alabama, Mississippi or Florida. But oil has shown up in seven locations on shore so far, with no new sightings in the past day, according to Suttles. He said cleanup activities were going on in each location. Other efforts to stanch the leak continue. Drilling of the first of two relief wells has reached 8,950 feet, said Lars Herbst, regional director for the Gulf of Mexico of the Minerals Management Service, and work on the other has begun. U.S. Rep. Charlie Melancon, D-Louisiana, concerned about people who are working to clean up the spill, has asked the White House to set up temporary health care centers along the Gulf Coast to serve volunteers and workers. Melancon envisions such clinics as providing ""medical checkups to people who have come in contact with the oil and assist[ing] in monitoring the health effects of the oil leak on south Louisianians."" He sent the request Wednesday to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. There was no immediate response from the agency. Track the Gulf oil spill . ""Many residents and volunteers are being exposed to hazardous materials on a daily basis, and some will have to travel hours to get treatment at the nearest health care facility. It is imperative that temporary health care clinics be established to provide basic health care services in this geographic area,"" he said. He has also asked Sebelius to ""appoint a health care coordinator to oversee and streamline the health care response."" Melancon emphasized that BP should be responsible for such health care services in his state. The energy giant was operating the oil rig that exploded and sank in April, triggering the spill. iReport: Track the spill, share stories . The spill began with an April 20 explosion and fire that sank the drill rig Deepwater Horizon two days later. Eleven workers were lost with the rig, which was owned by drilling contractor Transocean and hired by BP. The resulting slick now threatens the coastal marshes of southeastern Louisiana, where brown, syrupy oil made it past protective booms and into the wetlands near the mouth of the Mississippi River on Wednesday.

"Orlando, Florida (CNN) -- An autopsy report released Wednesday confirmed that a SeaWorld trainer killed after a 12,000-pound killer whale pulled her underwater died of drowning and traumatic injuries to her body, including her spine, ribs and head. Dawn Brancheau, 40, was working with a whale named Tilikum in knee-deep water at SeaWorld in Orlando on February 24 when the animal grabbed her by the ponytail and pulled her underwater in front of shocked onlookers at the park's Shamu Stadium. The autopsy report by the Orange County, Florida, medical examiner's office says Brancheau's spinal cord was severed, and she sustained fractures to her jawbone, ribs and to a cervical vertebra, in addition to the drowning. Rescuers were not immediately able to reach Brancheau because of the ""whale's aggressive nature,"" the county sheriff's office said. SeaWorld staff members recovered Brancheau after Tilikum was coaxed into a smaller pool and lifted out of the water by a large platform on the bottom of the smaller tank, authorities said. Video shows Tilikum performing before attack . A source at SeaWorld told CNN in February that after seizing her, the whale dove deep underwater. Brancheau's body was recovered about 40 minutes later. Tilikum has been linked to two other deaths. He and two other whales were involved in the drowning of a trainer at a Victoria, British Columbia, marine park in 1991. The trainer fell into the whale tank at the Sea Land Marine Park Victoria and was dragged underwater as park visitors watched. In 1999, Tilikum was blamed for the death of a 27-year-old man whose body was found floating in a tank at SeaWorld, the apparent victim of a whale's ""horseplay,"" authorities said then. The Orange County Sheriff's Office said the man apparently hid in the park until after it closed, then climbed into the tank. Because of Tilikum's history, as well as his size, trainers did not get into the water with him and specific procedures were in place for working with him, SeaWorld officials have said. Two days after Brancheau's death, the head of SeaWorld said Tilikum ""is a wonderful animal"" and ""will remain an active and contributing member of the team despite what happened."" ""He's a very special animal that requires special handling,"" said Jim Achison, president of SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment. ""Obviously, the procedures that we've had in place are something we're revisiting at this point."" Tilikum's size and weight -- 12,000 pounds, compared with 6,000 to 9,000 pounds for the facility's other killer whales -- were one reason separate procedures were in place for him at the Orlando facility.","NEW: Whale's aggressive nature prevented rescuers from immediately reaching trainer .

"(CNN) -- Former President Clinton on Monday complained about attacks from Sen. Barack Obama on Sen. Hillary Clinton in the latest back-and-forth bickering between the two rival Democratic presidential campaigns. Obama accuses Clinton of rewriting history in her complaints about his voting record on Iraq. ""I've got before me a list of 80 attacks on Hillary that are quite personal by Sen. Obama and his campaign going back six months that I've had pulled,"" he said, speaking to CNN contributor Roland Martin on WVON-AM's ""The Roland S. Martin Show"" based in Chicago, Illinois. At a campaign rally Monday in Reno, Nevada, Obama said he is ""concerned about the tenor the campaign has taken in the last couple days."" ""I think that I may disagree with Sen. Clinton or Sen. Edwards on how to get things done, but we share the same goals. We're all democrats, we all believe in civil rights, we all believe in equal rights,"" said Obama. ""I think they're good people, they are patriots and they are running because they think they can lead this country to a better place and I don't want the campaign in this stage to degenerate into so much tit-for-tat back-and-forth that we lose sight of why all of us are doing this."" Obama also warned his supporters to play fair. ""If I hear my own supporters engaging in talk that I think is ungenerous or misleading or in some way is unfair then I will speak out forcefully against them and I hope the other campaigns take the same approach,"" he said. A recording of comments Sunday by Black Entertainment Television founder Bob Johnson that appeared to criticize Obama's admitted past drug use were played on Martin's show. Johnson later said he was referring to Obama's community organizing efforts. ""When you listen to that tone and the inflection, he was not talking about community organizing. It seemed to be very clear what he was implying,"" Martin said. The former president said Johnson needs to be ""taken at his word,"" adding that ""nobody knew"" what he would say and ""it wasn't part of any planned strategy.""  Watch Martin's take on the interview » . ""This, to me, is another example of [the Obama campaign] wanting a double standard,"" he said.  Watch the latest on the war of words » . Clinton went on to say comments from Obama's campaign in the aftermath of former Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's assassination were ""a lot worse"" than what Johnson said. Obama's campaign implied that some of Hillary Clinton's foreign policy decisions helped exacerbate problems in Pakistan. The ex-president called the attack ""appalling"" and said his wife did not try to turn it into a larger issue, but instead ""said 'I disagree' and moved on."" Hillary Clinton did respond then, saying she regretted that Obama's campaign ""would be politicizing this tragedy, and especially at a time when we do need to figure out a way forward."" Johnson, a Hillary Clinton supporter, made his remarks Sunday at Columbia College in South Carolina, a state with a large share of African-American voters that holds its Democratic primary on January 26. Hillary Clinton also has accused Obama's campaign of distorting recent remarks by her and her husband that have touched off concerns among some African-American voters. Johnson said he has held fund-raisers for Obama but was unhappy with criticisms of the former first lady by Obama's campaign. ""As an African-American, I'm frankly insulted that the Obama campaign would imply that we are so stupid that we would think Bill and Hillary Clinton, who have been deeply and emotionally involved in black issues when Barack Obama was doing something in the neighborhood that -- I won't say what he was doing, but he said it in his book,"" Johnson said while campaigning at the largely black Northminster Presbyterian Church in Columbia, South Carolina. In Obama's recently reprinted 1995 book, ""Dreams from My Father,"" the future presidential candidate writes he was once headed in the direction of a ""junkie"" and a ""pothead."" In December, Clinton personally apologized to Obama after her New Hampshire campaign co-chairman raised the issue. The adviser resigned amid the controversy that followed. Johnson later Sunday said his remarks referred ""to Barack Obama's time spent as a community organizer, and nothing else. Any other suggestion is simply irresponsible and incorrect."" The Clinton and Obama camps are locked in an increasingly heated battle for black voters in South Carolina.  Watch what race has to do with the Democratic nomination » . Former South Carolina state Rep. ""I.S."" Leevy Johnson, an Obama supporter, called on Hillary Clinton to disavow Johnson's remarks. ""It's offensive that Sen. Clinton literally stood by and said nothing as another one of her campaign's top supporters launched a personal, divisive attack on Barack Obama,"" he said in a statement released by Obama's campaign. ""For someone who decries the politics of personal destruction, she should've immediately denounced these attacks on the spot."" Sunday's flare-up capped a weekend of sparring between the two camps that began with Clinton's comments last week that while the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. led the civil rights movement, ""Dr. King's dream began to be realized when President Lyndon Johnson passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It took a president to get it done.""  Watch what Clinton says about Obama, King and the civil rights movement » . Some African-American leaders criticized the remarks as dismissive of the civil rights movement and of King, who was assassinated in 1968. On Sunday, Obama described Clinton's comments as ""ill-advised"" but rejected any suggestion that his campaign has been behind the complaints. ""For them to somehow suggest that we're interjecting race as a consequence of a statement she made, that we haven't commented on, is pretty hard to figure out,"" he said. And the third leading Democrat, former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina, said Clinton was suggesting ""that real change ... came not through the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King but through a Washington politician."" Edwards won the South Carolina primary in 2004. Speaking Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" Clinton said Obama's backers were distorting her remarks and called King ""one of the people I admire most in the world."" And Sunday, at the Presbyterian church, Clinton said it was ""historic"" that both a black man and a woman were serious contenders for the White House. ""I am so proud of my party. I am so proud of my country, and I am so proud of Sen. Barack Obama because together we have presented our cases to the people,"" she said. Obama also accused her of ""rewriting"" history in her complaints about his voting record on Iraq. Former President Clinton last week criticized Obama's statements over the years about Iraq, arguing the senator has not been consistent. Obama has said his positions are consistent and that he has always staunchly opposed the war. ""She started her campaign saying she wanted to make history and has been spending a lot of time rewriting it,"" he said Sunday. E-mail to a friend .

"FORT WORTH, Texas (CNN) -- Bishop Kenneth Spears always thought gifts from God came from above. He never imagined that the gifts would be hiding under his church in Fort Worth, Texas. Bishop Kenneth Spears says natural gas has saved his church. ""What a God we serve,"" he says. ""The Bible says, 'Every place the sole of your foot should tread upon, I'll give it to you,' "" said Spears, of the First St. John Missionary Baptist Church. ""I walked and believed that if I prayed over that ground, if I walked over that ground, something good would come of it."" In 2006, he learned that all 15 acres of the church's property are on one of the largest natural gas fields in the country, known as the Barnett Shale. ""What a God we serve,"" Spears said, followed by great laughter.  Watch an oil drilling bonanza » . Spears' church and thousands of residents around the Fort Worth area are cashing in on a unique urban drilling bonanza. With the development of horizontal drilling technology and with gas prices sky-high, energy companies are racing to tap into the Barnett Shale natural gas field. The Barnett Shale is the most-productive natural gas field in such a highly populated area spanning 5,000 square miles. The drilling here is being watched closely in Louisiana and Pennsylvania, which also have natural gas fields under urban areas.  See where the Barnett Shale is located » . Energy companies in the Fort Worth area are going door-to-door, negotiating with people for access to mineral rights under their homes. That means residents are offered a bonus check and future monthly royalty checks. Spears' church received a $32,000 bonus and receives between $3,000 and $10,000 a month in royalty checks. The money is helping pay for a multimillion-dollar expansion and a new sanctuary. ""We're making a lot of millionaires up here in the Barnett Shale area,"" said Julie Wilson, vice president of Chesapeake Energy, one of the energy companies drilling wells in the Fort Worth area. The Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce says the urban drilling craze has created more than 50,000 jobs and will pump nearly $1 billion in tax revenue into the city's economy. But opponents of this urban drilling say that it shouldn't be done in populated areas and that the promises of many people getting rich aren't true. They say that for most people, the payouts are modest. How much money residents get depends on how much property they own and how much gas -- if any -- is found. The dollar figure also depends on each resident's negotiating skills with energy companies, experts say. The money can range from a few hundred dollars to tens of thousands. ""It's a divide and conquer strategy by going around and giving everybody enough money to keep them quiet. Hush money is what I call it,"" said Don Young, a community activist who operates a blog called FWCanDo.org. ""Gas drilling is very dirty; it's very dangerous."" To 72-year-old Jerry Horton, the drilling is a threat to her cherished front yard. To move the natural gas through the city, Chesapeake Energy needs to bury a pipeline in her yard. She's been offered almost $13,000, up from the $3,000 she was initially offered. ""I wouldn't sell my front yard for a million dollars,"" said Horton, a retired artist who has lived in the same house for 53 years. Chesapeake Energy recently sued Horton for access to her front yard, claiming eminent domain. The company says pipelines are crucial to keep the natural gas flowing and allow people to cash in the profits under the ground. ""I understand we need to pump our own oil, our own gas,"" Horton said. ""But we don't need to destroy our homes, all of our trees and blow ourselves up. Who's going to be here to enjoy the gas then?"" Energy companies say that drilling for natural gas is safe and done in an environmentally friendly way. But opponents say the drilling is dangerous and a threat to the environment. ""Gas drilling ... has no business in an urban area. So I don't want to contribute to a company that's doing that to my community,"" said Young, who refused to let his property be used. While energy companies maintain the drilling is not a threat to homes, some question the impact of drilling beneath neighborhoods. Young and other activists also are concerned about air and water pollution, soil contamination, health and safety issues and the loss of green space and wildlife. ""We're guinea pigs,"" Young said. ""We're the first large metropolitan area ever to have intense natural gas drilling going on in our neighborhood, right in the heart of the city.""","Natural gas drilling has become widespread across the Fort Worth, Texas, area .

"(CNN) -- Australia is asking an international court to weigh in on Japan's whale-hunting practices, officials said Tuesday. Japanese officials say their hunts are permitted under rules prohibit commercial whaling but allow whaling for scientific reasons. But Australian officials said they've filed a lawsuit with the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands, to stop Japan from exploiting the research loophole. ""We believe that it's possible to do all the research that you need to do and understand everything that you need to ... and you don't have to kill them to do it,"" Australian Environment Minister Peter Garrett told CNN Tuesday. Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hidenobu Sobashima said Tuesday that Japan's whaling, which has killed up to 1,000 whales in Antarctic waters annually, is authorized. ""Japan's research whaling is a legal activity,"" he said, noting that the country would continue to explain its perspective in international court. The move toward legal action is ""regrettable,"" Sobashima said, when international whale-hunting rules are still being negotiated. The International Whaling Commission is scheduled to evaluate existing whaling rules at its annual meeting in June. But Garrett said diplomatic negotiations over the issues have not produced results. He stressed that taking the case to court does not mean that the relationship between Australia and Japan -- strong allies and trading partners -- has soured. ""We think we can disagree about one thing and continue to have close relationships across a range of other issues,"" he said. Japan's whaling has drawn sharp criticism from environmental advocacy groups, who claim it involves the cruel slaughter of whales so that meat can be sold in markets and restaurants. Japan's fisheries agency has said that it wants ""sustainable whaling"" and also advocates conservation. ""Clearly, the acceptance of other cultures' dietary practices and the promotion of cultural diversity is as important as saving endangered species and the promotion of biological diversity,"" the agency's website says. ""If the consumption of whale meat does not endanger whale species, those who find the practice unacceptable for themselves should not try to impose their view on others."" Australia's lawsuit comes as an anti-whaling activist was facing charges including assault and trespassing in a Japanese court. Prosecutors allege that Peter Bethune, an environmental activist from New Zealand, threw butyric acid at a whaling ship, jumped aboard and attempted to make a citizen's arrest of the captain. Bethune has pleaded guilty to all charges accept assault. He testified Monday that he did not intend to hurt anyone. A verdict is expected later this month.

"(CNN) -- A judge ordered mediation Thursday for all parties wanting access to videos showing the death of a SeaWorld trainer, court documents say. Florida Circuit Court Judge Lawrence Kirkwood last week granted a temporary injunction against release of the footage, which was captured on February 24 at SeaWorld in Orlando, Florida. It was not immediately clear for how long the injunction would last. Trainer Dawn Brancheau, 40, was interacting with an orca named Tilikum when it grabbed her ponytail and pulled her underwater in front of shocked onlookers at Shamu Stadium. She died of multiple traumatic injuries and drowning, authorities said. Jon Mills, the attorney for Brancheau's family, argued that their right to privacy outweighs other concerns. ""The potential harm to this family is incredibly severe,"" Mills said. ""There is no constitutional right to voyeurism and there is a constitutional right to privacy, and the court is being asked to balance those."" Coverage from CNN affiliate WKMG . Court mediation will weigh privacy concerns against the public's right to know under Florida law. One potential agreement during mediation could allow the parties in the case to view the videos, but not have copies of them, a court document says. Interested parties have until April 5 to request to join the mediation. No date has been set for the mediation. The Orlando Sentinel, The Tampa Tribune, The Lakeland Ledger and WFLA-TV have filed in the case. Parts of last month's incident were captured on two cameras at the park -- one that shows a view from underwater and another from the park's Sky Tower, according to the family's complaint. ""The underwater view does not show Mrs. Brancheau until after she had entered the water. The overhead camera was not aimed at the scene until after the incident had begun,"" the complaint says. ""Significantly, neither camera shows what occurred in the moments prior to and including Mrs. Brancheau being pulled into the water and offer no insight into the cause of this tragic event."" Brancheau's family filed the complaint against the Orange County Sheriff Office and District Nine Medical Examiner's Office, which possess the footage. SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment has joined the lawsuit filed by Brancheau's family. ""This is a video of someone's death,"" Mills said last week. ""There's nothing you can learn from the video other than what a tragic, horrible, traumatic attack it was."" An attorney for the sheriff's office has said it does not take a position about any video release, but it needs to keep copies so that its case file is complete.","Trainer Dawn Brancheau's death was caught on tape at SeaWorld Orlando .

"(CNN)  -- From victims of gunshot wounds and domestic violence to common road injuries, Trinite Hospital in Port-au-Prince, Haiti is inundated with trauma cases daily. A mother and child in the recovery room of Trinite Hospital in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. The stream of patients arriving at the free clinic run by international aid group Medecins Sans Frontieres is virtually uninterrupted. Some arrive in police ambulance or via the Haitian Red Cross; others are dropped off in wheelbarrows, according to Brian Phillip Moller, head of the 60-bed trauma center. Gunfire no longer fills the nights the way it did when he was last in Haiti in 2006, but the workload for aid workers hasn't diminished. Instead hospitals like Trinite are dealing with trauma cases the public health system is incapable of handling, Moller tells CNN. While the security situation in Haiti has improved during the last two years, the public health system remains in disarray, according to Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), also known as Doctors Without Borders. The organization, which offers free care at three clinics in Port-au-Prince, says basic health services are practically non-existent in the capital city, the result of a public health system marred by mismanagement, strikes and shortages of medical personnel and supplies. ""The Haitian system is at breakpoint,"" says Moller. The private health care sector has developed in recent years, but most in poverty-stricken Haiti cannot afford to pay the fees charged for services. MSF is urging the international community to increase pressure on Haiti to improve its health system. The call comes as UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, Haiti's Prime Minister Michele Pierre-Louis and representatives of donor countries are set to meet in Washington Tuesday to discuss international assistance for the country. With the public health system underfunded and understaffed, patients often have nowhere to turn but to free clinics. An obstetrics hospital run by MSF in Port-au-Prince manages 40 percent of the childbirth-related emergencies among poor women in the city. At Trinite, doctors treated nearly 18,000 trauma cases last year. The hospital's bed occupation rates are at 100 percent and at times staff have no choice but to refer patients to public health facilities that they know are inadequate.  See photos of the health crisis in Haiti » . MSF France, which runs the Trinite trauma center, plans to withdraw from Port-au-Prince next year, which could make the situation for Haiti's poorest even more dire. Urban conflict has subsided, reducing the need for a war surgery hospital, Moller says. About one-third of the cases at the hospital are related to road vehicle accidents. The group's mission is to provide urgent care to crisis-hit areas, he says, not cope with everyday trauma. Although the security crisis has abated, violence, is still very much a part of life in Haiti's capital city and poses a major health care challenge. One in five cases admitted to the Trinite are violence related. ""Access to adequate health care is a basic human right and it is definitely not being met here in Haiti. The issue needs to be addressed very quickly. People are dying needlessly and will continue to unless this issue is addressed,"" Moller says.","Medecins Sans Frontieres says public health system in Haiti failing patients .

"Palo Alto, California (CNN) -- If our nation wants to reduce global warming, air pollution and energy instability, we should invest only in the best energy options. Nuclear energy isn't one of them. Every dollar spent on nuclear is one less dollar spent on clean renewable energy and one more dollar spent on making the world a comparatively dirtier and a more dangerous place, because nuclear power and nuclear weapons go hand in hand. In the November issue of Scientific American, my colleague Mark DeLucchi of the University of California-Davis and I laid out a plan to power the world with nothing but wind, water and sun. After considering the best available technologies, we decided that a combination of wind, concentrated solar, geothermal, photovoltaics, tidal, wave and hydroelectric energy could more than meet all the planet's energy needs, particularly if all the world's vehicles could be run on electric batteries and hydrogen fuel cells. We rejected nuclear for several reasons. First, it's not carbon-free, no matter what the advocates tell you. Vast amounts of fossil fuels must be burned to mine, transport and enrich uranium and to build the nuclear plant. And all that dirty power will be released during the 10 to 19 years that it takes to plan and build a nuclear plant. (A wind farm typically takes two to five years.) Stewart Brand says now is the time for nuclear power . The on-the-ground footprint of nuclear power, through its plants and uranium mines, is about 1,000 times larger than it is for wind. Wind turbines are merely poles in the ground -- with lots of space between them that can be farmed, ranched or left open -- or poles in the ocean. Geothermal energy also has a much smaller footprint than nuclear; solar only slightly more. But while geothermal, solar and wind are safe, nuclear is not. For nuclear to meet all the world's energy needs today -- 12.5  terawatts (1 terawatt = 1 trillion watts) -- more than 17,000 nuclear plants would be needed. Even if nuclear were only 5 percent of the solution, most countries would have nuclear plants. What's worse, the nuclear industry wants to reprocess waste to obtain more energy from increasingly scarce uranium. But this only produces more weapons-grade uranium and plutonium. A global push toward nuclear energy would mean that uranium enrichment -- and efforts at nuclear weapons development -- would certainly grow throughout the world.. Nuclear proponents argue that not enough clean renewables exist to power the world. However, part of our work at Stanford University has been to map world renewable energy resources. Enough wind and solar exist in high-wind and sunny locations over land to power the world for all purposes multiple times over. There is no shortage. Nuclear proponents also argue that nuclear energy production is constant, unlike fickle winds and sunshine. But worldwide, nuclear plants are down 15 percent of the time, and when a plant goes down, so does a large fraction of the grid. Connecting wind farms over large areas through transmission lines smoothes power supply. Combining geothermal with wind (whose power potential often peaks at night) and solar (which peaks by day), and using hydroelectricity to fill in gaps, would almost always match demand. Converting to electric vehicles and using smart charging practices would also help to match supply with demand. So would storing energy (with concentrated solar) and giving people incentives to reduce demand. It is not rocket science to match power demand. It merely requires thinking out of the box. Finally, the costs of land-based wind, geothermal and hydroelectricity are competitive with conventional new sources of electricity; costs of solar and wind over the ocean are higher but declining. Costs of nuclear have historically been underestimated. In sum, if we invest in nuclear versus true renewables, you can bet that the glaciers and polar ice caps will keep melting while we wait, and wait, for the nuclear age to arrive. We will also guarantee a riskier future for us all. There is no need for nuclear. The world can be powered by wind, water and sun alone. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mark Z. Jacobson.","Every dollar spent on nuclear power is one less spent on renewable energy, says Mark Jacobson .

He says mining, transport, enriching of uranium and building plants require fossil fuels .

"(WIRED) -- Barnes & Noble's Kindle competitor may have been the worst-kept secret since balloon boy's disastrous appearance on CNN last week. Barnes & Noble has unveiled an e-reader called ""Nook,"" which will sell for $260 in November. But the advance hype doesn't seem to have hurt the launch of the Nook, an impressive-looking $260 device that will go head-to-head with Amazon.com's Kindle, currently the most successful product in a small but growing market for e-book readers. Basic details of the Nook were published by the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday following leaked images that appeared on Gizmodo last week. And Barnes & Noble leaked product details hours before reporters filed into Pier 60 in Manhattan for the announcement on Tuesday afternoon. ""Simply following the leader is not in our DNA,"" said Barnes & Noble president William Lynch. Indeed, Barnes & Noble's $260 Nook device differs from the Kindle in a number of ways. Most notably, it shares: A feature called LendMe lets users borrow certain books (depending on the publisher's wishes), the same way readers have traditionally traded paper books. The Nook's color touchscreen allows you to navigate titles and enter search terms using a virtual keyboard that goes dark once you're reading. The Nook will be available for pre-order starting Tuesday night for $260 at Nook.com, and will ship in November. It has a 6-inch, ""paper-like,"" 16-level grayscale display that supports up to five fonts and various font sizes. It can read a user's PDFs, as well as the 1 million-plus books, magazines and newspapers available in Barnes & Noble's eBook store. The device connects to the Barnes & Noble eBook store using a free 3G AT&T connection, but lacks a web browser ""because those are clumsy"" on eReaders, Lynch says. It includes support for the ePub eBook format, FictionWise and PDF, as well as RSS feeds from the internet. However, you can't subscribe to any old RSS feed. Instead, Barnes & Noble selects certain feeds to convert to ePub, then sends them out each morning for a fee that varies by publisher. Like Amazon's Kindle, Barnes & Noble's Nook lets you highlight and annotate content. But Nook's battery life is 10 days, while the Kindle keeps you reading for 14 -- even though at 11.2 ounces the Nook weighs an ounce more. Unlike the Kindle, the Nook has a Wi-Fi radio that customers will be able to use at Barnes & Noble's more than 700 physical locations and 600 college stores in 50 states. The current version does not allow connection to Wi-Fi networks outside the stores, but will allow Nook owners to digitally flip through books while they're in a Barnes & Noble store and read free content. The Nook runs Android OS, which Lynch said ""works really well for navigating on this small device."" However, at this point, third-party developers cannot develop apps for the device, and no version of the reader for generic Android devices is available. The device packs enough memory to hold up to 1,500 books (2 GB), with a microSD slot that lets you add up to 16 GB more. In addition to e-books in the three formats mentioned above, the device supports a user's pictures and MP3s (it includes a speaker and headphone jack, but there's no text-to-speech engine). Another nice touch: The virtual bookmark feature called Reading Now lets you pick up where you left off on the Nook or on more than 100 other devices with support for Barnes & Noble's eBook store. Perhaps the biggest difference between the Nook and the Kindle is cosmetic. The Nook, with color icons, a wide selection of designer cases and color-customizable back panel, looks like a fashionista compared to the more bookish Kindle.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The pilot of a small Cessna 172 aircraft reported stolen from a Canadian flight school has been captured, authorities said. The pilot was flying a plane similar to this one -- a Cessna 172 -- before he landed in Missouri. The pilot reportedly stole a small Cessna 172 aircraft from a Canadian flight school, flew hundreds of miles across the Midwest, landed on a dirt road in Missouri late Monday and took off on foot, federal officials said. Federal, state and local authorities launched a manhunt for the pilot, who was identified by the FBI as Adam Leon, 31, a native of Turkey who became a Canadian citizen last year, according to FBI spokesman Richard Kolko. He was formerly known as Yavuz Berke, though officials did not indicate a reason for the name change. He was taken into custody at an Ellsinore grocery story after a brief manhunt, according to Missouri state police and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. A federal law enforcement source said the pilot parked the plane under what appeared to be a bridge or culvert, apparently in an attempt to hide it. The plane had been intercepted and tracked by U.S. military aircraft as it flew from Canada into U.S. airspace and meandered southward for several hours before landing, a Department of Homeland Security spokesman said. It landed in the town of Ellsinore, population 360, in southern Missouri, a dispatcher with the Carter County Sheriff's Office said. A spokesman for the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) said the pilot flew ""erratically"" over the course of the afternoon, at time reaching 14,000 feet in altitude, then dropping as low as 3,000 feet. The Cessna departed the school in Ontario at about 3 p.m. ET and flew over Lake Superior less than half an hour later, according to NORAD officials. F-16 fighter jets intercepted the pilot near Michigan's upper peninsula border with Wisconsin at 4:43 p.m., and tracked the Cessna until its safe landing. The NORAD spokesman, Mike Kucharek, said military pilots who intercepted the Cessna had tried repeatedly to get the pilot's attention and at one point, the pilot appeared to acknowledge that he saw the other aircraft. ""He looked at them,"" Kucharek said. But the pilot had not communicated with NORAD or the Federal Aviation Administration, Kucharek added later in the evening. At 9:20 p.m., the pilot was believed to have had roughly 30 minutes of fuel left, Kucharek said. ""We don't want to suppose the motive of the individual,"" Kucharek told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" after the landing. ""But it certainly made a day for the professional pilots that were flying these missions and a very serious situation from a NORAD perspective."" Officials allowed the pilot ""to play his hand"" because they ""[didn't] want to provoke the situation,"" Kucharek said. A federal law enforcement official told CNN the pilot is a naturalized Canadian citizen, but declined to give his name or country of origin. The source said the pilot was a flight school student for a ""brief"" period and only clocked a few hours of flight time. Canadian officials have received some information that the pilot is ""not a happy individual,"" the official said. The Cessna departed at about 3 p.m. ET and flew over Lake Superior less than half an hour later, according to NORAD officials. F-16 fighter jets intercepted the pilot near Michigan's upper peninsula border with Wisconsin at 4:43 p.m., and have tracked the Cessna since. Earlier in the evening, the Wisconsin National Guard deployed two F-16s of its own in an attempt to get the pilot to establish communications with FAA air traffic controllers. The state capitol in Madison, Wisconsin, was evacuated for less than an hour as a precaution. FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown said the plane was reportedly stolen from a flight school in Thunder Bay, Canada, and the pilot had been identified as a student at the flight school. Both Lt. Cmdr. Gary Ross of NORAD and Brown of the FAA said the 14,000-feet altitude is above the level at which the FAA requires use of oxygen. Brown said it was not clear whether the Cessna had supplemental oxygen on board. Ross says the plane is a long-range version of a Cessna 172. It was fully fueled, giving it about seven hours of flying time. Ross said if NORAD officials believe the aircraft poses a threat, ""we take seriously any intent to harm any of our citizens or critical infrastructure."" He added that ""all options are on the table although we continue to move towards a resolution that doesn't call for [lethal force].""

"(CNN) -- Foreign governments should urgently accept Haitian orphans on humanitarian grounds following this week's devastating earthquake, an orphanage director in Haiti and adoptive parents said Friday. Emergency visas and passports could help push through adoptions that were stalled after the quake, and would open up beds for children who lost their parents in the disaster, said Dixie Bickel, director of God's Littlest Angels orphanage just outside Port-au-Prince. Paperwork for adoptions that were under way when the earthquake hit Tuesday night may now be buried in the rubble of collapsed buildings and lost, said Bickel, whose orphanage cares for 152 children, including 84 babies. The government officials who deal with adoption cases may be missing, hurt, or otherwise focused on the disaster, which means the adoptions won't go through, she said. ""I would like to see the international community come up with a plan for the children that have been adopted by European, Canadian, and American citizens of how these children can go to their adoptive parents' countries, either under refugee status or emergency status of some sort,"" Bickel told CNN. God's Littlest Angels is considered one of Haiti's larger orphanages. Parents who have adopted children through the orphanage are also pressing their governments for emergency action. ""The orphans need to be granted refugee status and allowed to come home to their adoptive parents,"" said Allison Garwood of Los Angeles, California, who adopted a boy from GLA and brought him home last year. ""The U.S. needs to not only allow but demand that children be sent to their adoptive families right away."" British citizen Chris Skelton, who arrived in Haiti hours before the earthquake hit to sign paperwork as part of the adoption process, wrote a public letter urging foreign help. ""I cannot express the sheer magnitude of the plight that the children of this country have faced, one which will now spiral downwards further with devastating results,"" Skelton wrote in the letter. ""The situation is dire -- there will be many more children in need of help, and GLA and other orphanages cannot cope with the increased need."" The foreign ministries of Britain, Belgium, and France said they could not immediately respond, but Luxembourg's Foreign Ministry said it was aware of the issue. ""The Luxembourg authorities are informed of the situation of Miss Bickel and the children at the orphanage God's Littlest Angels, and our authorities are in touch with the Red Cross and the local authorities to solve the issue,"" spokesman Robert Steinmetz told CNN. Bickel said her request is only for those children who have been adopted but who are still in Haiti as their cases go through a lengthy government approval process which can take anywhere from six months to two years. The children's paperwork may have been in the pipeline but after the quake, the status is now unclear, Bickel said. ""Some of my papers were in the Palace of Justice -- that building is no longer there,"" she said. ""Some of my paperwork was in the Ministry of the Interior -- I don't know if that building is there. I had passports being printed (for the children). I don't know if the paperwork is still there."" Bickel said her lawyer told her the country's top adoptions official, Judge Rock Cadet, was killed when the courthouse collapsed. As long as the adopted children can make it out of the country, Bickel said, the orphanage can ensure the children's paperwork is completed in Haiti. If the children can't leave the country, it will mean orphanages like Bickel's must turn away any children newly orphaned by the earthquake, she said. ""It leaves me with children in my care who are going to sit here for an additional five, six months at least,"" she said. ""It's going to prevent me from taking in any children that were affected by this disaster. My beds are full. I can't take any children in, not unless I put them on the floor or I put two or three children to a bed.""","Orphanage head urges governments to accept Haitian children for adoption .

"(CNN) -- The recent ruling of a federal appeals court requiring the family of fallen hero Lance Cpl. Matthew Snyder to pay the legal expenses of Fred Phelps and his misguided followers at Westboro Baptist Church is unconscionable. Like Matthew's father, Albert, I am all too familiar with the hardships associated with losing a son in combat, having lost my son Justin in 2004. It is a tragedy that the thanks given the Snyder family in return for the life of their son is a court order to repay the legal expenses of the hate group that protested at his funeral with signs such as ""thank God for dead soldiers."" Beyond simply insulting though, this decision by the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals is a slap in the face for every Gold Star family that has lost a loved one in combat. It also represents an egregious misuse of the judicial system; one that sets a dangerous precedent for how the memory of our fallen heroes will be treated. The Supreme Court should immediately move forward with this case and stand up for those who have stood in the face of danger for all Americans. The legal maneuvers that brought Albert Snyder and his family to this point are enough to make any American shake his or her head in disgust. After Snyder lost his life in 2006, Fred Phelps and his followers showed up at his funeral to spread their message of hate. Mind you, they didn't know Matthew, and thus had no understanding of the enormous sense of loss his family was feeling; they simply decided that the Snyder family's vulnerability presented an easy platform for their own agenda. To his credit, Albert Snyder sued the group and won an $11 million judgment against them. However, that award was reduced to $5 million on one appeal and overturned altogether this week by the appeals court. In fact, not only did the court overturn the original ruling, but it decided to add to the pain and suffering of the Snyder family by imposing more than $16,000 of court fees. Perhaps the judges had forgotten that without the sacrifices of brave soldiers and their families, the American judicial system would have been a long-distant memory. Beyond the inherent injustice of the court's decision is the message it sends to the thousands of families around the country that have received a tightly wrapped flag and heard the words, ""On behalf of a grateful nation ..."" When the Snyder family sued to protect the common decency we should provide to all grieving families, their efforts were met with court orders to pay the legal bills of those who caused their family so much needless pain. Surely, this is not the kind of thing that Lance Cpl. Snyder or my son, Justin, gave their lives to protect. Has our nation learned nothing from our treatment of returning Vietnam veterans? What would have been the reaction to Fred Phelps and his repugnant actions during World War II? Our veterans and the families of those who didn't return deserve better than this. Looking ahead, as engagements in Afghanistan draw on and our soldiers answer the call to defend freedom around the world, this case could have a dangerous effect on morale and willingness to serve. It is time for the Supreme Court to take up this case, not only for families like Albert Snyder but for the families who will bear the ultimate price of freedom in the future. The justices should strike down the ruling of the Virginia court that brushed aside the sacrifice of Lance Cpl. Snyder and restore common sense and basic decency to the way we honor our fallen heroes. Snyder fought on behalf of all of us, and now his father fights on his behalf. I can only hope that the Supreme Court will restore some measure of justice and dignity to a family so richly deserving of the best the United State has to offer. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Ellsworth.","Father of a dead Marine was ordered to pay court costs to protesters who picketed funeral .

"London, England (CNN) -- Apple CEO Steve Jobs this week rebuffed the suggestion that Apple will revolutionize TV in the same way it has reshaped the music industry, mobile phones and tablet computers. But Jobs is bluffing: The time is right for Apple for tackle the TV, and the company's re-entry into that market is a no-brainer. Just a ""hobby"" ""Smarter people than us will figure this out"" was Jobs' deflective response to a question about Apple's TV aspirations at the D8 Conference on Tuesday. Subsidized business models essentially give customers a set-top box for free, Jobs argued; why would they pay for another? He explained that the lack of a national cable operator, not to mention the lack of standards around TV, has led to Balkanization, or the breakup into smaller units: ""It's a fundamental go-to-market problem."" ""Apple TV is a hobby,"" he added in reference to the company's neglected set-top box offering. Jobs' denials . The deflection is latest in a long line of half-truths from Jobs. It's a smart tactic that allows the company to lower market expectations and fool competitors. In 2003, Jobs said of Apple's rumored entry into the cell phone business: ""We didn't think we'd do well in the cell phone business. What we've done instead is, we've written what we think is some of the best software in the world to start syncing information between devices."" Four years later, the iPhone reshaped the smartphone market. In the same interview, Jobs proclaimed, ""There are no plans to make a tablet. It turns out people want keyboards. We look at the tablet, and we think it is going to fail."" This week, Apple announced that more than 2 million iPads have been sold since the touchscreen device was released in April. Jobs is remarkably consistent in his misdirection. Two years previous to the launch of the $499 iPad, he claimed: ""We don't know how to make a $500 computer that's not a piece of junk. Our DNA will not let us do that."" Prior to adding video support to the iPod, he professed: ""I'm not convinced people want to watch movies on a tiny little screen."" Before the launch of Apple's iBook store: ""It doesn't matter how good or bad the product is; the fact is that people don't read anymore."" Jobs' denial of a new service is by no means evidence against its existence; the contrary, in fact. The TV opportunity . The Internet-connected TV is an idea that's finally ripe for consumer adoption. Or more precisely: the TV as a platform. Apple's iTunes is an obvious starting point to turn the TV into an entertainment hub; it brings your purchased music, TV shows and movies to the big screen. But Apple TV, the company's first foray into the television business, boasted this exact integration and failed to take the world by storm. What has changed? The glaring opportunity is for Apple to bring the App Store to TV. With access to millions of applications -- including games -- on a big screen, the television would finally become engaging. The blockbuster launch of the iPad has proved that a screen, once connected to an endless supply of content and applications through iTunes and the App Store, becomes infinitely more powerful. The TV is simply a larger screen. Competitive pressure . This opportunity hasn't been lost on Google. Its upcoming Google TV product will run its mobile Android OS. The reason is simple: Thanks to Android, Google TVs will benefit from the app ecosystem Google already built for mobile phones. Google's strategy also points to a solution to the ""set-top box problem"": While Google will offer a separate box, the company has additionally partnered with Sony to have the software pre-installed in some TVs. Such a union is less likely in Apple's case, however: Apple has always preferred to create its own hardware. And while Jobs denies that consumers want another box in their living rooms, I'd wager that rumors of a $99 set-top box running the iPhone OS are indeed accurate. Beating Balkanization . The cable operator issue is trickier, but similar Balkanization in the phone space proved no barrier to Apple's iPhone ambitions. The same will be true here. Apple may name multiple cable companies as partners or simply sidestep the problem; bringing Apple's app ecosystem to the biggest screen in the house is a compelling proposition on its own. And yet ... Jobs doth protest too much. The Apple CEO explained the cable cartel in such labored terms that he must surely be in the process of untangling that thorny issue. So my bet is that Apple will indeed strike deals with cable companies to produce a comprehensive offering for TV watchers. Apple TV: a matter of time . Will Apple take another shot at television? It's inevitable. The Internet-enabled TV is coming, and Apple is perfectly positioned to join the fray. © 2010 MASHABLE.com.

"Washington (CNN) -- Only one-quarter of Americans think the federal stimulus plan has helped the middle class, while a majority say it has helped bankers and investors, according to a new national poll. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Wednesday morning indicates that 25 percent of the public thinks the stimulus has benefited the middle class. One-third of the people questioned think the stimulus has helped low-income Americans, with just over four in 10 saying the plan has benefited business executives. A majority, 54 percent, think the stimulus has helped bankers and investors. ""Opinions on the economic stimulus bill are colored by the perception that it has helped fat cats, but not ordinary Americans,"" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. ""It's possible that the belief that the stimulus bill helped bankers and CEOs is due to the public confusing the stimulus bill with the various bailout bills that were passed at roughly the same time last year."" The survey also indicates that one-quarter think the stimulus has helped people in their own community, with three in 10 saying it has hurt people in their community and 45 percent saying the plan has had no effect. According to a CNN poll released Sunday, 56 percent of the public opposes the stimulus, with 42 percent supportive of the plan. Last March, just weeks after President Obama signed the stimulus bill into law, a CNN survey indicated that 54 percent supported the program, with 44 percent opposed. The program, formally known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, attempts to stimulate the country's economy by increasing federal spending and cutting taxes, at a total cost to the government of $862 billion. No Republicans in the House of Representatives and only three in the Senate voted for the bill. The stimulus was initially thought to have a price tag of $787 billion, but the Congressional Budget Office on Tuesday increased its forecast for how much the stimulus will add to the nation's deficit, raising its estimate by $75 billion. The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll was conducted January 8-10, with 1,021 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points. CNN Deputy Political Director Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.","Poll: 25 percent of the public thinks stimulus has benefited the middle class .

"ALPHARETTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Latin music pulses from the stereo as 40 women jump, shimmy and sway to the beat. Zumba is the most popular exercise class at one suburban Atlanta YMCA. It's not a dance club. This is a regular morning exercise class at the YMCA in Alpharetta, Georgia. It's called Zumba. Part dance, part aerobics, Zumba is an hourlong routine that works almost every muscle in the body. ""It is dance fitness,"" explained Stephanie Maxim, one of two class instructors. ""We teach them moves that you can see on 'Dancing with the Stars': salsa, mambo, cha-cha, and we put it into a group fitness format."" ""It's not like a workout,"" explained Diane Walterstiel, 55, of Alpharetta. ""Before I come, I'm tense, but when I leave, I could kiss the world."" Nearly a year after being introduced at the YMCA in suburban Atlanta, Zumba is the most popular exercise offering at the facility. Alberto Perlman, co-founder and CEO of Zumba Fitness in Hollywood, Florida, wasn't surprised when the concept took off not just in the United States but around the world. ""We turned exercise into a party,"" Perlman declared. ""Zumba broke some of the rules of fitness. We used music in the original form instead of using step counts."" Perlman, whose background is in marketing, teamed up with Colombian dancer and choreographer Alberto ""Beto"" Perez in Miami in 2001. ""One day, Beto forgot his aerobics tapes, so he played his salsa and meringue songs during class in their original form,"" Perlman said. ""People went crazy. They didn't feel like they were in a class with a drill sergeant."" Perlman said Perez decided to call the exercise Zumba, after the Colombian slang word meaning to buzz like a bee or move fast. Zumba is now a brand name. Since 2003, Perlman's group has trained 20,000 instructors around the world and sold more than 3 million DVDs on the Internet and through infomercials, he said. Heather Bleakman teamed up with Maxim to teach the Georgia YMCA session. She called the class a form of therapy. ""We see women change,"" she said. ""We see their faces light up."" Bleakman stood at the front of the room and offered a high-impact version of Zumba for those who could keep up while Maxim focused on a slower low-impact routine. Maxim warned participants at the beginning of class to modify the exercise to fit their needs. She added that wearing proper footwear is one of the best ways to guard against injury. ""In Zumba, we do a lot of pivoting, so you've got to have a shoe that has more of a flat base so you can move, or you'll feel the torque in the knee,"" Maxim cautioned. Lilieth Burke, 48, of Alpharetta started attending Zumba classes a year ago and kept coming back because she appreciated ""the simple composition of dance moves."" Unlike other exercise workouts she's tried, ""Zumba is not a punishment,"" she said. Burke summed up the benefits: ""I feel fit, I sleep better, I feel better, I feel younger, and I feel I can live another 48 years.""","Set to original-form music, Zumba classes combine dancing and aerobics .

"(CNN) -- The driver of a slain Catholic bishop in southern Turkey has been apprehended in the killing, the Turkish Foreign Ministry said Thursday. The victim was identified by the Vatican as Luigi Padovese, the apostolic vicar of Anatolia. He was assaulted Thursday in his house in Iskenderun in Hatay province, the Vatican said. ""We were dismayed to hear that Bishop Prof. Luigi Padovese lost his life as a result of being stabbed by his driver today in Iskenderun, Hatay,"" the ministry said, saying the death is ""a human, religious and academic loss."" ""This attack on a man of religion, whatever its reason might be, has received significant public condemnation. We have learned that the suspect, who has psychological problems and is currently being treated, was apprehended with the murder weapon. Detailed information will be shared with the public when the ongoing judicial investigation is concluded. ""This murder has led to deep sorrow for everyone. Hoping that the deceased will rest in peace, we extend our most sincere condolences to his family, to our citizens of Christian belief and the entire Catholic community,"" the ministry said. Church officials expressed ""shock and sorrow"" over the death of Padovese, who was also the president of the Turkey Bishops Conference . ""I can only express an immense pain over this violent act that has taken us by surprise,"" Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said. ""The tragedy of this event shows the difficulty that the Christian community endures in the Middle East region."" Roman Catholics in Turkey ""occasionally have been subjected to violent societal attacks,"" according to the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, a U.S. government agency. The group's latest report cites the February 2006 shooting death of ""an Italian Catholic priest"" in Trabzon by a boy ""angered over the caricatures of the Muslim prophet in Danish newspapers."" A 16-year-old boy was charged with murder and sentenced to jail in the act, which drew condemnations from Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and other government officials. In July 2009, a ""mentally disturbed young man"" killed Gregor Kerkeling, a Catholic German businessman in what has been described as an anti-Christian hate crime. The suspect confessed.","NEW: Slain Catholic bishop's driver captured in stabbing death, Turkish ministry says .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Boys may soon be able to get Gardasil, the vaccine given to girls and young women to prevent infection by four types of human papillomavirus. Gardasil, a vaccine against human papillomavirus, would be given to boys exactly as it is to girls. A Food and Drug Administration advisory committee voted Wednesday to recommend that the vaccine be made available to boys and young men aged 9 to 26 for protection against genital warts caused by HPV. The vaccine protects against four types of HPV, and two of those are believed to be responsible for 70 percent of cervical and anal cancers, and HPV-associated penile and throat-and-neck cancers. The other two cause 90 percent of genital warts cases, researchers say. At Wednesday's advisory committee meeting, pharmaceutical giant Merck & Co., maker of Gardasil, presented data from three clinical trials that the company claims supports broadening the distribution of the vaccine to include males. The trials included more than 5,400 boys and men from six continents and 23 countries. According to Anna Giuliano, an independent scientist at Moffit Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida, and the trials' principal investigator, ""The data clearly demonstrates that there was a benefit to men in receiving Gardasil. Overall, we saw a 90 percent reduction in disease -- genital warts and pre-cancerous lesions -- caused by HPV in men and an 89 percent reduction in genital warts incidence. ""Essentially, we have a really fantastic opportunity to extend the benefit of the vaccine to men,"" Giuliano said. ""This is a sexually transmitted infection; if we can reduce infection and related diseases in men, we have the potential to have a much broader public health impact by reducing the overall burden of infection and disease in the community at large."" Giuliano said there were no serious adverse events related to the vaccine. There were some minor side effects such as pain at the injection site and low-grade fever. The vaccine would be administered in boys and young men exactly as it's been given to girls and young women: three doses over a period of six months. Merck spokeswoman Pam Eisele said the cost will be $130 per dose. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 20 million Americans are infected with HPV. There are 6.2 million new infections each year. The CDC says that at least 50 percent of sexually active men and women get an HPV infection at some time in their life. The American Social Health Association says HPV is the most common sexually transmitted virus and puts that number at 75 percent or more. The CDC says that although HPV is very common in both sexes, most men won't develop symptoms or serious health problems, and there is no test to detect the virus in men. The only approved HPV test on the market is for women, for use in cervical-cancer screening. The advisory committee also voted that Cervarix, a new HPV vaccine made by GlaxoSmithKline, appeared to be safe and effective for girls and young women 10 to 25 years of age. Cervarix has been approved in Europe. ""This is an important step in cancer prevention for the millions of girls and young women at risk for cervical cancer,"" said Barbara Howe, vice president and director of North American vaccine development for GlaxoSmithKline. ""If approved, Cervarix will provide protection against cervical cancer, a devastating disease that is responsible for thousands of deaths in U.S. women each year."" Still, the panel recommended that Glaxo do more studies that would monitor miscarriages and other problems reported by patients. In a final review, both applications will be considered by the FDA, which usually -- but not always -- follows the recommendations of its advisory committees.","Committee says shots could prevent genital warts in males 9 to 26 .

"London, England (CNN) -- The twin brother of the man allegedly responsible for one of the worst massacres in recent British history was among 12 people killed before the gunman took his own life, police said Thursday. The series of drive-by shootings in northern England also left 11 people wounded. David Bird, the 52-year-old twin brother of alleged shooter Derrick Bird, was found dead at his home in the English village of Lamplugh, police said. David Bird, they noted, was the father of three daughters. Early Wednesday evening, British authorities identified four other victims. Garry John Purdham, 31, was found dead in a field on the roadside next to a pub. Darren Paul Rewcastle, 43, was a local taxi driver. Cyclist Michael James Pike, 64, was shot dead in the road. Jamie Michael Dennis Clark, 23, was found dead in his car. Earlier, authorities named three other people killed in the shootings: 60-year-old solicitor Kevin Commons, who was found in his driveway; 57-year-old Susan Hughes, a mother of two; and 66-year-old Jane Elizabeth Robinson. The UK's head of state, Queen Elizabeth II, issued condolences, saying she was ""deeply shocked"" by what happened. ""In asking you to pass my deepest and most heartfelt sympathy to the families of all those who were killed or injured, and to the injured themselves, I am sure I share in the grief and horror of the whole country,"" the queen said. Police also released a map tracing the route that suspect Derrick Bird, 52, is believed to have traveled on his rampage through the region on Wednesday. Were you there? Send your pics, video . The route begins near the village of Lamplugh and winds through Cumbria, taking in the seaside towns of Whitehaven and Seascale before ending up farther inland near Boot, in the Lake District. Police lifted the cordons at most of the 30 separate crime scenes, but Derrick Bird's house in Rowrah, near Frizington, remained one of those roped off, they said. Forensic experts were examining two weapons seized by police, a shotgun and a .22 rifle fitted with a telescopic sight. Police said Bird was a licensed firearms holder for 20 years and they were investigating whether the license covers the seized firearms. Gun laws tightened after massacres . ""The focus of the 100-strong squad of detectives investigating the incident is firmly on finding out why someone would want to take so many lives in such a short space of time,"" Cumbria Police said in a statement. ""Officers and staff are conducting forensic evidential searches and tests across the area at each location."" ""What happened [on Wednesday] was unthinkable and is without doubt the most horrific incident I have seen in my 25 year long policing career,"" said Cumbria Chief Constable Craig Mackey. ""We now need to work together as a county to recover as we look to the future."" Police finished searching the known and possible routes Bird could have used -- an area covering 150 kilometers (93 miles) -- and said as a result they were not expecting to find any more victims. Of the wounded, eight remained in hospitals Thursday, with four in stable and four in ""comfortable"" condition, police said. Local Detective Chief Superintendent Iain Goulding released a statement identifying Derrick Bird as a self-employed taxi driver who had lived in Rowrah since 1993. Goulding noted that Bird drove a silver Citroen Picasso, which was used during Wednesday's shooting spree. Meanwhile, a taxi driver shot in the back during Wednesday's killing spree has described how he watched Bird shoot dead another driver, Darren Rewcastle, at point blank range. ""He turned up and shouted 'Darren' before walking up to him and taking his face off. I saw it. He just shot him,"" Reed, a former soldier, told the Liverpool Echo. Wounded taxi driver 'watched friend shot in face' Peter Leder, who described himself as a friend of Bird's, told CNN he spoke to Bird on Tuesday night and Bird told him, ""You won't see me again."" Leder said Bird drove his taxi in Whitehaven for more than 20 years and described him as ""an outgoing, well-known guy, who everyone liked."" Bird was close to his mother, who is ill in a local nursing home, Leder said. He said his friend enjoyed scuba diving, went on several diving trips abroad and practiced regularly at the Whitehaven swimming baths. Leder said he knew Bird had guns but said he was not violent. ""I can't shed any light on it,"" Leder said. ""... He was a decent guy, and I'm sorry for what's happened.""

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- Fifty-six government employees -- including a police officer, a felony court clerk, two corrections officers and 27 school bus drivers and attendants -- were arrested in a scam that used health insurance information to fraudulently obtain prescriptions for the painkiller OxyContin, authorities said Wednesday. Arrested as ""recruiters"" in the alleged OxyContin scam, are, clockwise: Janice Currington; Dwonvalyn Johnson; Barbara Miller Benaby; Guyton Wynell; Marcella Pierce; and Wanda McNeal. Sixty-two people were arrested in total and all face charges including racketeering, conspiracy to commit racketeering and grand theft, according to the Miami-Dade state attorney's office. Authorities estimate 130 medically unnecessary prescriptions for OxyContin -- more than 12,000 tablets -- were presented to pharmacies. The drugs have an estimated street value of $400,000, prosecutors said. OxyContin is a popular painkiller, delivering an instant ""high"" when it is crushed or dissolved and ingested. The scam began in January 2003, when six ""recruiters"" enlisted a group of people, most of them employees of local government, to participate in the ring, according to prosecutors. Those employees provided their health insurance identification information, and with that information they obtained unnecessary prescriptions for OxyContin from another codefendant, who was a physician, authorities said. The defendants filled those prescriptions at pharmacies and sold the pills for cash to another codefendant, authorities said. In addition, prosecutors said, the defendants submitted claims to their insurance companies for reimbursement for the OxyContin prescriptions. ""There can never be an excuse for helping put dangerous drugs onto our streets,"" said Katherine Fernandez Rundle, Miami-Dade state attorney. ""When public employees are a part of the problem and when public medical benefits are used to make the scheme work, these are shameful events. They are also crimes."" Among those arrested, according to authorities, were: . • 17 Miami-Dade County Public Schools bus drivers . • 10 Miami-Dade County Public Schools bus attendants . • Six city of Miami Department of Solid Waste employees . • Five Miami-Dade County Public Schools security officers . • Three Miami-Dade County Public Schools custodians . • Two Miami-Dade County Corrections and Rehabilitation corrections officers . • Two Miami-Dade County Public Schools teacher assistants . • Two Miami-Dade County Transit bus drivers . • One city of Hialeah police officer . • One city of Miami crane operator . • One Miami-Dade County Circuit Court felony clerk . • One Helen B.

"(CNN) -- Actor Gary Coleman, who had suffered from a brain hemorrhage from an accident in his home Wednesday, died Friday in a Utah hospital, a hospital spokeswoman said. Family members and close friends were at his side when life support was terminated at 12:05 p.m. (2:05 p.m. ET), Janet Frank said. Coleman's wife, Shannon Price, issued a short statement Friday afternoon saying details of how the former child actor died will be made public later. ""Now that Gary has passed, we know he will be missed because of all the love and support shown in the past couple of days,"" Coleman's spokesman, John Alcantar, said in a written statement. ""Gary is now at peace and his memory will be kept in the hearts of those who were entertained by him throughout the years."" Coleman, 42, was rushed by ambulance to a hospital after the accident in his Santaquin, Utah, home Wednesday, Frank had said in a statement released earlier Friday.

"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- The mother of a Spanish man who died from the human form of mad cow disease has also died from the illness, Spain's Ministry of Health said Wednesday. Spain has taken steps to avoid mad cow disease, and there is no danger from eating meat, officials said. It is believed to be the first case in the world where two members of the same family have died from mad cow disease, said Juan Jose Badiola, director of Spain's national research center for mad cow disease. ""It's noteworthy that there's a double case in the same family,"" Badiola said. Until now, Badiola added, clinical evidence that he's seen from the United Kingdom and France -- which have had the most deaths due to the human form of mad cow disease -- have not recorded two cases in a single family. The mother, in her early 60s, died last month. The government confirmed Wednesday that it was because of mad cow disease but did not, by custom, make her name public. Her son, 41, died in February from the same disease, Badiola said. The latest confirmed case makes a total of four deaths in Spain from mad cow disease since 2005. Three of these cases in Spain were in the same northern province, Leon, which is another unusual aspect that will be studied, Badiola said. Ten years can pass between eating contaminated tissue and the appearance of the human form of the disease, called variant Creutzfeldt Jakob disease, health officials say. The health ministry said there is no danger from eating meat in Spain, because of existing controls. The steps to avoid the disease, taken after the first cases of mad cow disease appeared in the United Kingdom, included isolating infected animals and prohibiting cattle feed of animal origin or with animal proteins, the ministry said. ""The appearance of these sporadic cases is within the predictions that were made at the European level more than eight years ago,"" the ministry statement said. Badiola said that it's likely the mother and son contracted the disease before stricter controls against mad cow disease began in 2001 in Spain. The pair had similar eating habits, Badiola said, which included eating animal organs, such as kidneys and livers, and they may also have eaten animal brains. Researchers will try to determine whether the mother and son shared a genetic structure that might have been more prone to contracting the illness, Badiola said. The family's home was in a village near the provincial capital of Leon, 333 kilometers (206 miles) northwest of Madrid. The other case in that province was of a woman, 50, who was a local government worker in the provincial capital. She died in December from mad cow disease. The first confirmed death from mad cow disease in Spain was in 2005, when a young woman died near Madrid. In addition to the cases in Spain, as of June the following numbers of cases of human mad cow disease had been reported: 167 in the United Kingdom; 23 in France; four in Ireland; three in the United States; two each in Netherlands and Portugal; and one each in Canada, Italy, Japan and Saudi Arabia . Two of the three U.S. cases, two of the four cases in Ireland and the single cases in Canada and Japan were people probably exposed to the mad cow agent while residing in the United Kingdom, officials have said. One of the 23 French cases may also have been infected in the United Kingdom.","Expert: First case where two members of same family died from mad cow disease .

"STONE MOUNTAIN, Georgia (CNN) -- Rosa Foster sat down at the kitchen table with a plate of fried chicken and a salad. Before taking a bite of food, she bowed her head and prompted her grandchildren to say the blessing. Rosa Foster is a single parent raising four grandchildren under age 19. Foster, 54, of Stone Mountain, Georgia, doesn't just see the kids on weekends and holidays. They live with her full time. Foster is one of 2.5 million grandparents around the United States who are the primary caregivers for their grandchildren. In Foster's case, she's a single parent, raising four grandkids under age 19. ""It has not been a picnic all the time,"" Foster said. ""It's been hard."" Hard may be an understatement, according to Nadine Kaslow, chief psychologist for Grady Health System in Atlanta, Georgia. ""There are many challenges for grandparents taking on grandchildren,"" Kaslow said. ""Many grandparents are older when they take on grandchildren, so you may not have the energy you had as a parent in your 20s and 30s to be running around after toddlers."" Foster didn't have a choice. She said she was awarded custody of her daughter's 2-year old son, Rakim, in 1991. That was 17 years ago. She's since taken in his twin sisters, Rosea and Ronea, now 17, and 12-year-old Raquel. ""Some days I became a little sad and depressed and I would cry through baby feedings, but I still knew I had to keep the babies together. They didn't have anybody else,"" Foster recalled. The unexpected demands of caring for grandchildren full time may have health consequences, Kaslow said. ""You often see people having aches and pains or headaches or stomach aches,"" she said. ""It can be associated with more serious physical problems like elevated blood pressure or things that put you at risk for heart disease or stroke.""  Health Minute: More on grandparent stress » . Foster remembered sleeping only one or two hours a night while she worked two jobs trying to pay the bills. Kaslow said it is common for grandparents to feel the stress of financial demands when they're a parent the second time around. ""Oftentimes you're at a place in your life where you're ready to take care of yourself, have more fun, plan for your own retirement,"" Kaslow noted. ""Monies you were trying to save for your own future, you are now having to spend on your grandchildren."" She suggested that grandparents set priorities when it comes to their own career and work. While resources may be limited, she recommended trying to find financial help from state agencies, religious groups or other relatives. For those who may feel overwhelmed, she added, ""You don't need to be the sole caregiver. It's really important for you to reach out to other people in your support network, your immediate family, to get their assistance."" She also stressed the need for grandparents to take good care of themselves. Find time to exercise and eat a healthy diet. ""I recommend if you can, get someone to baby-sit the kids once a week or every other week,"" she said. ""You really need time alone."" Does Foster ever get time for herself? She chuckled, explaining that she has put her own life on hold for 17 years. But, she added, ""I wouldn't have it any other way."" Foster has some serious advice for other grandparents who may be in a similar position: ""Make sure you're up for the challenge, because if you're not, you're going to break some kids' hearts. If those kids are torn up a second time, they're really going to be destroyed.""","2.5 million grandparents in the U.S. are the primary caregivers for their grandchildren .

"New York (CNN) -- Staring down a smoking homemade bomb and dismantling it is dangerous enough. Doing it with news cameras rolling on a busy Saturday night in the middle of Times Square is something Det. Patrick LaScala of the New York Police Department swears never entered his mind. Until the following day. ""You're home the next day, and you're really thinking about it. Then, you start to put the pieces together and you think, 'Wow,' "" LaScala said in an exclusive interview. LaScala was manipulating the police robot that laid the groundwork for one of his partners, Det. Raymond Clair. ""This was the first time that I went down on a vehicle, and I saw clocks and wires and gas and propane. I identified it as a bomb, and I had to look twice,"" Clair said. After 13 years as a bomb tech, that night was the one Clair says he'll remember the most. Clair and LaScala are part of New York's elite bomb squad, a unit whose size is a closely guarded secret. CNN was given special access to the unit in order to find out what a more typical day can be like. During one recent 16-hour shift, I watched the same five-man team who worked the bungled bomb plot in Times Square check their equipment, catch up on paperwork and make sure Dan-O, their explosives-sniffing dog, was raring to go. The K-9 is named for a member of the squad who died in the 9/11 attacks when one of the twin towers collapsed. On a busy side street outside their Manhattan offices, neighbors watched them go through their paces with the robot. ""We think they're great,"" one man said. Another passerby snapped a picture of the robot with her cell phone. ""Is that the robot that checks out bombs?"" she asked. It was. But robots, as sophisticated as they are, can only do so much. They're capable of blowing out windows, blasting a suspicious package to bits, photographing an object from several angles and sending those images to investigators. The squad doesn't want to publicize more specific details. Still, a human touch often can't be avoided. With help, bomb techs first crawl into an 85-pound protective suit that covers their bodies from head to toe. The feet nearly look like those of a platypus, the material is stiff and hot, and the chest plate is heavy. A helmet is cinched on around the neck, and an air hose keeps outside air flowing into the mask. Put on gloves, and it's hard to imagine that anyone in such bulky gear could maneuver and dismantle possible bomb components. But that's what they're trained to do. ""The more you do, and the more you get involved, the better you'll get when it's the real thing,"" Clair said. Det. Greg Abbate also was there for the ""real thing"" in Times Square. He said his training kicked in. ""There's a strong bond between us. We go to a job, there's very little talk. Everyone knows what they have to do,"" he said. Despite the immense dangers associated with the work, whenever the unit checks out a suspicious package, bomb technicians jockey for the opportunity to suit up. ""We actually have arguments over who's taking the job,"" added Abbate. When CNN traveled with them on a call, it was Abbate's turn to wear the gear. The bomb squad was called to check out a backpack found in a park near a police headquarters checkpoint. The team sped to the scene with sirens screaming. Other units ringed the perimeter. X-rays were taken. Abbate moved in. This time, he determined that this time, there was nothing to it. Sgt. John Ryan said it's necessary to assume the worst until the team moves in. ""Everything is a bomb until we say it's not a bomb, "" said Ryan. The days are long, but the men say they feel ""blessed"" to be part of the bomb squad. They laugh when people suggest they must be a little crazy to do such a dangerous job. ""It's an honor,"" LaScala said. And it never gets old. ""At the end of the day, it's just one day down and a lot more to go,"" said Det. Mike Garcia. CNN producers Julian Cummings and Ross Levitt contributed to this report.","CNN visits the bomb squad that handled the recent Times Square incident .

"Canandaigua, New York (CNN) -- ""Can you say that again? You put a bullet through the wall in your house?"" Angela Price begins this evening at work like any, listening to troubled veterans in need of a sympathetic ear or immediate help. She reaches for a pen and paper. She's a trained responder for the Veterans Affairs Department's National Suicide Prevention Lifeline in the upstate New York town of Canandaigua. She asks a series of questions: ""Where's the gun at now?... OK, so the gun is nowhere near you? ... OK, I'm glad that you're safe,"" she says, somewhat relieved but still concerned about the caller. Price is one of some 20 responders, counselors, social workers and health tech assistants staffing 15 phone lines and three chat lines at the center at any given time. She talks with the caller for 45 minutes. He shot a bullet into the wall of his house and then went for a drive. She is able to coax him to pull over, calm him down, and arrange for follow-up care. Most of the callers want information regarding mental health and other medical services available to them provided at their local VA hospitals. But for others, the call they're making is a last resort. Each year, more than 30,000 people kill themselves, 20 percent of them veterans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That's 18 veteran suicides a day. Every call presents another opportunity for the hot line responders to try to prevent another tragedy. The crisis center, staffed around the clock seven days a week, opened in July 2007, largely borne from widespread criticism that the department was not responding adequately to veterans in crisis. Janet Kemp, the Veterans Administration Suicide Prevention Coordinator, says the phones haven't stopped ringing since the hot line's inception. ""It's about being able to provide them with immediate assistance, immediate resources, appointments. It assures that we're not going to let them drop through the cracks after they hang up the phone,"" Kemp says. Before the VA suicide prevention program began, that wasn't always the case. Jim and Marianne Schulze told CNN in early 2007 that their son Jonathan, an Iraq combat veteran, killed himself in January of that year, after being told he was No. 26 on a waiting list to get checked into a VA hospital. The Schulzes said their son had been suffering with post-traumatic stress disorder for nearly two years. He died with an extension cord wrapped around his neck, a picture of his daughter by his side, they said. Six months later, the VA Suicide Prevention Lifeline opened. To date, the crisis center has received almost 250,000 calls. ""The health techs assist the counselors in getting the person the services they need at the time,"" Kemp says. ""If they need emergency services or information, the health techs can pick that up, and find the person who can help them in their local area, and make those connections."" If necessary, the center arranges an emergency rescue, or in less dire circumstances, a wellness checkup at the caller's home. The center also follows up the next day, according to Kemp. The 2010 hot line budget is more than $15 million, including staffing, phone and contract costs and more than $4 million for public messaging campaigns, according to the VA. The center's newest feature is a chat line for those who prefer computer-oriented communication, especially young vets such as those who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""Since that's been open, we've talked to several thousand people over the chat and have been able to facilitate some rescues through that service."" Chat counselor Rich Barham recalls an incident while chatting with a Navy vet who barricaded himself in his house, with two children asleep upstairs, as he suffered flashbacks from Iraq. Barham sent help. ""When the police broke in, I heard he had a gun, and I was hoping bad things weren't going to happen to him,"" Barham says. ""We were able to get his wife on the phone, and he was taken to the hospital and she was able to come home to take care of the kids."" Hot line responder Christopher Maginn is in the Army Reserves, and he just returned from serving in Afghanistan. ""For me, it's kind of hitting two birds with one stone, because I get to work with guys that have worn the uniform, and I still wear the uniform today, so, it's always meant a lot to me to work here,"" says Maginn. Many callers are recent Iraq and Afghanistan veterans who struggle with reintegration, he said. Often, they're too proud to pick up a phone and ask for help. The main goal is ""to listen to them, and to validate what they're going through, and provide them services,"" he said. Kemp says it's all in an important day's work. ""I feel lots of times it's their last hope, their last chance, and if we can provide that little bit of hope, and get them to realize that they called and there are options,"" says Kemp. ""It's an amazing feeling."" The phone number for the hot line is 800-273-TALK (8255). The chat line is at www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org.","Many hot line callers are young vets of Iraq, Afghanistan wars struggling with reintegration .

Even if someone is not a Facebook user or is not logged in, Facebook's social plugins collect the address of the Web page being visited and the Internet address of the visitor as soon as the page is loaded -- clicking on the Like button is not required. If enough sites participate, that permits Facebook to assemble a vast amount of data about Internet users' browsing habits. ""If you put a Like button on your site, you're potentially selling out your users' privacy even if they never press that button,"" says Nicole Ozer, an attorney with the ACLU of Northern California. ""It's another example of why user control needs to be the default in Facebook."" In the last few months, scrutiny of the privacy practices of the Internet's second most popular Web site has reached an all-time high, with politicians threatening probes and privacy activists calling for formal investigations. In response to the outcry, Zuckerberg convened a press conference last week at Facebook's Palo Alto, California, headquarters, where he pledged to make privacy ""simpler."" For its part, Facebook told CNET on Tuesday that the information about who viewed what pages with a Like button is anonymized after three months and is not shared with or sold to third parties. A representative acknowledged, however, that the current privacy description of Facebook's social plugins ""is not as clear as it could be, and we'll fix that."" Facebook's FAQ says: ""No data is shared about you when you see a social plugin on an external website."" No mention of this data-sharing appears under the ""Information from other websites"" section of the company's general privacy policy. Publishers like ""Like"" Almost as soon as Zuckerberg had finished describing the Like buttons at the F8 developer conference in April, they became a hit with Web publishers hoping for a traffic boost. Wired's Webmonkey.com published a tutorial, a WordPress adaptation appeared, and Foursquare quickly incorporated the concept too. Facebook itself confirmed that after only a week, ""more than 50,000 sites across the Web have implemented"" social plugins. SearchEngineLand.com said Like buttons are ""recommended"" for virtually all Web sites; one blogging how-to guide reported that ""small, blue Like buttons are now multiplying across the Web faster than you can say 'pandemic.'"" Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said that if his group had been aware of how the Like button was implemented, it would have raised this topic in a request for a Federal Trade Commission investigation of Facebook's privacy practices. (The statement sent to the FTC says, in part, that social plugins ""violate user expectations and reveal user information without the user's consent."") ""The recent Facebook changes are too complex and too subtle for most users to meaningfully evaluate,"" Rotenberg said. ""And it's not obvious that the recent announcement from Facebook has addressed all of these problems."" On the other hand, some of the Like button's features can work only if Facebook receives the user ID and URL of the Web page being visited. That allows a custom bit of Javascript code to customize the Like button. Social plugins ""work the same basic way all widgets across the Internet do,"" said Barry Schnitt, a Facebook spokesman. ""The URL of the Web page the user is viewing must be sent to Facebook for Facebook to know where to render the personalized content."" Schnitt said Facebook does not correlate pages viewed with advertising, so someone who spends a lot of time reading articles about German sports cars on caranddriver.com will not receive Porsche 911 or Mercedes C63 AMG ads on Facebook.com. ""Of course, if the user actively 'likes' that page, then it is added to their profile and they might see a related ad on Facebook,"" he said. ""We use the information to help improve the service,"" Schnitt said. ""We need to see how many people see a certain Like button to know what the click-through ratio for that button is, for example. If something has a really low rate, maybe something is wrong with the site, the implementation, or our product. If it is really high, maybe something fishy is going on."" The way Facebook has implemented its Like button resembles an advertising network: Code on Facebook's systems is executed whenever someone loads a page on, say, Mashable.com, one of the Web sites that quickly adopted the button. And advertising networks have come under significant regulatory scrutiny before, in part because they have the ability to create dossiers on what Internet users are doing across thousands or millions of different Web sites. Ozer, the ACLU attorney, said she would caution sites to be careful before adopting Like buttons: ""If an organization puts a Like button on their site, they're potentially telling Facebook about everyone who visits their Web site, every time that person visits their Web site."" How it works . Facebook wants publishers to insert an iframe or JavaScript in the HTML for their Web pages. As soon as the page is loaded, the code invokes a PHP script at Facebook.com that records information including the URL for the Web page, your IP address, and your Facebook ID (if you're authenticated). If a publisher uses Facebook's Javascript API, the simpler option, here's what the embedded Like button for CNET.com would look like: <fb:like href=""cnet.com"" font=""tahoma""></fb:like> . © 2010 CBS Interactive Inc.

"Washington (CNN) -- Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer made clear Tuesday she's not worried about a potential legal challenge from the Obama administration over her state's controversial immigration law. ""We'll meet you in court,"" Brewer told CNN' when asked how she would respond if President Barack Obama's Department of Justice decided to challenge the law. ""I have a pretty good record of winning in court."" The American Civil Liberties Union is currently leading a court challenge. Attorney General Eric Holder, who met with a delegation of police chiefs from Arizona and elsewhere this week to discuss the law, has yet to indicate whether the federal government would file a legal challenge. Obama, who has called the law ""misguided,"" will meet with Brewer at the White House on Thursday, a White House official told CNN. It will be the first one-on-one meeting between the two since Brewer approved the law in April. The new immigration law, implemented last month, allows police officers to check the residency status of anyone who is being investigated for a crime or possible legal infraction if there is reasonable suspicion the person is an illegal resident. Critics, including Holder, have said the law will promote racial profiling. But Brewer said Tuesday the law does not target an individual's specific race. She also made clear driver's licenses are not sufficient to prove citizenship. ""It wouldn't matter if you are Latino or Hispanic or Norwegian,"" she said. ""If you didn't have proof of citizenship and the police officer had reasonable suspicion, he would ask and verify your citizenship. I mean, that's the way that it is. That's what the federal law says. And that's what the law in Arizona says."" Brewer strongly defended the law, saying she would not suspend it even if Obama sharply increased the number of U.S. troops at the Mexican border. iReport: Share your view on the Arizona law . The Arizona governor also said the White House has not adequately communicated with her about Obama's recently announced plan to dispatch 1,200 National Guard troops to the border. ""I'm sitting here with no good information. It would be very helpful, I might say, if somebody would give me something in writing telling me what they're sending to Arizona, how will it be distributed?"" she said.

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- North Korea reacted to a South Korean anti-submarine exercise early Thursday by saying it would meet ""confrontation with confrontation"" and war with ""all-out war,"" according to North Korean state-run media. ""Now that the puppet group challenged the DPRK [North Korea] formally and blatantly, the DPRK will react to confrontation with confrontation, and to a war with an all-out war,"" according the KCNA news agency. The news agency referred to South Korean leaders as a ""group of traitors"" and said they would experience ""unheard of disastrous consequences"" if they misunderstand North Korea's will. The response comes amid high tensions on the Korean peninsula, after Seoul blamed Pyongyang for the sinking in March of a South Korean warship. An official South Korean report has accused the communist North of firing a torpedo at the ship, killing 46 sailors. Explainer: Why are the two Koreas so hostile? U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, visiting Seoul on Wednesday, called the sinking ""an unacceptable provocation by North Korea"" and said the international community should respond. Also Thursday, the general staff of North Korea's military -- the Korean People's Army, or KPA -- said it was enacting new measures to deal with any ""all-out confrontation."" The steps would ""retract all measures for providing military guarantees for the North-South cooperation and exchange, and the promise of a physical strike. ""The KPA will make a prompt physical strike at the intrusion into the extension of the Military Demarcation Line under our side's control in the West Sea of Korea,"" the army said, according to the KCNA news agency.","South Korean anti-submarine exercise prompts angry response .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Colleges aren't getting any cheaper, but federal student loans are. Students who graduate with college loan debt can use a repayment plan that will give lower monthly payments. Millions of borrowers will get a better deal on their student loans based on federal rules that went into effect Wednesday. Lower interest rates and loan forgiveness in some cases are some of the rules that will make borrowing cheaper for many students. Also among the rules: an income-based repayment program that considers income and family size. The program allows borrowers to set their monthly loan payment at 15 percent of their annual adjusted gross income. Under the traditional 10-year plan, a borrower who graduated with $25,000 in student loan debt and whose income is $30,000 a year would pay $288 a month at an interest rate of 6.8 percent, according to the the Department of Education's Web site. Now, the student could opt for payments of $172 a month spread over a longer time. Borrowers can apply the plan to their remaining loan amount as of Wednesday. Single borrowers who earn less than $16,245 -- the poverty level -- would not be required to make any payments on their federal loans as long as their income remained that low. Payments would be significantly lower under the income-based plan, but loans would take longer than the standard 10 years to repay. That could increase overall interest costs for borrowers. Proponents argue that for some it is well worth the tradeoff by making lower-paying jobs more appealing. ""Just imagine all those people that went to college and had expectations of a good job market and now it's not so hot,"" said Deputy Undersecretary Bob Shireman of the U.S. Department of Education. ""This provides a kind of safety net, helps give them some assurance that they'll be OK, and that they'll even be OK if they go into lower paying jobs."" For students who eyed public service as a career but thought the salary underwhelming, a loan forgiveness option for public sector workers might inspire some. Borrowers who work for 10 years in a public service job, such as public school education or the military, will have the remainder of their federal loans forgiven after that decade ends. Graduates must pay monthly loan bills during those 10 years and can use the income-based plan to lock in lower payments. The government counts work from October 2, 2007 onward, Shireman said. Thus, the earliest a borrower can have loans forgiven is October 2, 2017. Also providing relief to borrowers are a lowered interest rate, increase in Pell Grants for current students and a reduced loan origination fee. The government cut the interest rate from 6 percent to 5.6 percent. Payouts of Pell Grants, which allow students to borrow less, increased by $619 to $5,350 for the 2009-2010 school year. Loan origination fees decreased from 2 percent to 1.5 percent and will fall to 1 percent next July, Shireman said. Congressional Democrats pushed the income-based plan, public service program and decrease in loan interest rates, all signed into law by former President George W. Bush under the College Cost Reduction and Access Act. President Obama's stimulus bill supported the increase in Pell Grants. Last year, the government gave out about $80 billion in student loans to more than 7 million students.

"(CNN)  -- Heavy rains and hurricane-force winds that surpassed 70 miles per hour in places toppled trees, left more than half a million people without power, and suspended travel throughout much of the Northeast and mid-Atlantic region Saturday night. Four inches of rain fell in parts of the region, and the National Weather Service extended storm and flood warnings for much of the area into Sunday. ""This storm is such a slow mover that it's not going to pull out probably until Monday,"" said CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras. ""There's another whole day to get through with heavy rain and strong winds."" Some areas will see an additional 1 to 3 inches of rain by Sunday, Jeras said, though winds are expected to die down to a maximum of 30 miles an hour. Power outages darkened much of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Connecticut. New Jersey's PSE&G electric company said 136,000 customers were without power Saturday night, while Long Island Power Authority said close to 190,000 customers lacked electricity. ""The ground is so wet from all the snow we've had this winter, it's helping the trees to topple over, as well as our utility poles,"" said Long Island Power Authority president and CEO Kevin Law. ""The conditions are still too terrible to get crews out there."" Law said that some customers will likely go without power until early next week. Con Edison reported 97,000 customers without power in New York City and Westchester County, while other electric companies in the region reported tens of thousands more were in the dark. Amtrak suspended trains between New York and Philadelphia because of issues with overhead wires and power outages. About 10 Amtrak trains were affected. New Jersey Transit stopped train service for the majority of its system, including the Northeast Corridor, North Jersey Coastline, Raritan Valley, and Atlantic City Rail lines. A New Jersey Transit spokeswoman said many trees have fallen on overhead wires. Boston's Logan International Airport diverted flights due to weather and there were reports of major delays at airports throughout the Northeast. Across the region, trees and utility poles crashed onto houses and cars. Part of a crane collapsed at a construction site in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The New York police department brought in additional 911 operators Saturday to handle the surge in emergency calls.","Four inches of rain and winds topping 70 mph recorded in parts of the Northeast .

"RIVERVIEW, Florida (CNN) -- The captain of the container ship Maersk Alabama ignored explicit warnings to stay well off the coast of Somalia before his capture by pirates in 2009, according to 16 of its 19 crew members. ""It's almost like he wanted to be captured,"" the ship's chief engineer, Mike Perry, told CNN in an interview to air on tonight's ""AC360."" Capt. Richard Phillips spent four days as a hostage after the attempted seizure of the Maersk Alabama. After his rescue by U.S. Navy SEAL commandos, Phillips was lauded as a hero, and the publisher of his new book promoted him as a sea captain who risked his life by offering himself as a hostage ""in exchange for the safety of the crew."" The 16 crew members have been far less public about the events, even as Phillips toured the country this spring to promote his book, ""A Captain's Duty."" But now they are telling a different version of what took place in the waters off the Somali coast in early April 2009. Perry, a 20-year veteran of the U.S. Navy, was the chief engineer aboard the Alabama as it sailed from Oman, in the Persian Gulf, to Mombasa, Kenya, with a cargo of relief supplies. He told CNN Correspondent Drew Griffin that Phillips' decision ""certainly warrants an investigation."" ""I just want an investigation, for this to be looked at properly before that man winds up going back to sea on another ship and endangering somebody,"" Perry said. Perry said he sailed on the Alabama after the pirate incident and retrieved e-mail warnings -- seven in all -- that urged the Alabama and other ships in the area to stay clear of the Somali coast and sail 600 miles away if necessary to avoid pirate attacks. Another former crew member, third engineer John Cronan, told CNN that Phillips ""was advised to change course by competent deck officers and he overruled them."" ""Stay on course, make our ETA, stay on the same course,"" Cronan quoted Phillips as saying. For his part, Phillips said his preparations went beyond the industry standard for safety. He said the crew's version of events is linked to a suit filed against the Danish shipping line Maersk, which owns the Alabama. So far, six former crew members, not including Perry, have filed suit, claiming the company ""knowingly sent their employees into pirate-infested waters, rather than taking safer routes."" ""We live in a litigious society,"" Phillips said. ""So I can't really talk about what their complaint is. Their complaint is with the company, so it's not my place."" Maersk has no comment on the lawsuit, the company told CNN. According to the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, the Alabama was attacked about 380 miles off the Somali coast. Most of the e-mail warnings were sent by a private maritime security agency called Securewest International and were directed at all ships in the area, though one was specifically sent to Phillips. Each e-mail was based on information from British and U.S. naval authorities and urged the Alabama to stay clear of the shipping lanes where Phillips was heading. ""Vessels should consider maintaining a distance of more than 600 nautical miles from the Somali coastline,"" one of the Securewest messages advised. Phillips acknowledged the existence of those e-mails, but said he could not respond to the accusations because of the lawsuit. Another crew member, Abu Tahir Mohammed Reza -- who goes by the initials ""ATM"" -- told CNN that he was on the Alabama's bridge when the Somali pirates began their attack. He said he spotted the pirates about three miles behind and to the right of the container ship and said Phillips ""laughed at me"" and ""ignored me completely"" when he reported the fast ship attack. Phillips disputed that account, saying he did not ignore any first warnings. ""I'm not someone who laughs a lot. Ask my crew, do I laugh a lot and tell jokes? I think the majority will say no,"" he said. Phillips conceded, however, that in his book that he erred in identifying Reza as a Pakistani -- the sailor is from Bangladesh -- and that he was also wrong in writing that Reza gained U.S. citizenship via a lottery. And he said the real heroes are the Navy SEALs and his crew, whom he says stayed calm, followed orders and instincts and prevented a tragedy. ""They did a wonderful job,"" he said. ""It's in the book. Everywhere I speak, I say what a great job they did."" As for the widely repeated notion that he gave himself up to the Somali pirates in exchange for the safety of his crew, Captain Phillips told CNN ""the media got everything wrong."" ""I didn't give myself up,"" he said. ""I was already a hostage by then."" He added, ""I think you're forgetting they had guns."" Sailors aboard the destroyer USS Bainbridge killed three of the four pirates who held Phillips and captured the fourth, Abduwali Abdukhadir Muse. Muse pleaded guilty last week to charges he hijacked the Alabama and kidnapped the captain, and he faces a maximum sentence of almost 34 years behind bars. The crew members who allege Phillips ignored warnings about Somali pirate attacks have created a Facebook page, ""Alabama Shipmates."" Perry said none initially wanted to go public with their assertions, but decided to do so as a group after the publication of Phillips' book in April. ""We vowed we were gonna take it to our graves,"" he told CNN. ""We weren't going to say anything. Then we hear this PR stuff coming out about giving himself up and he's still hostage, and the whole crew is like, 'What?' "" Perry told CNN the crew had heard numerous international radio broadcasts declaring Phillips had exchanged himself for the safety of the crew. When told that many of his crew feel slighted by him, Phillips said, ""There's not much I can say."" ""The media made everything out to be me,"" he said. ""But that's the media. When I came home, I really didn't go and put myself in front of the media. A lot of my crew did. I didn't."" Watch Anderson Cooper 360° weeknights 10pm ET.

"(CNN) -- There's a post-9/11 atmosphere in Kingston, Jamaica, local residents say, after a failed police assault on the stronghold of a suspected drug kingpin wanted by the United States. ""The daytime really isn't a problem, but the night can be. Your rights are reduced after 6 p.m. The police can stop you for virtually any reason. It's a similar situation to after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks in the United States,"" one Kingston florist told CNN. ""I wouldn't say I'm afraid,"" said the woman, who asked that neither she nor her shop be named. But, she said, ""You don't know exactly what is happening."" ""You are more cautious because you know what's going on, but it's not like you can't come out of your home. ... It's not like you can't go out, but it could be more of a hassle if you do,"" she said. Police moved earlier this week to arrest Christopher ""Dudus"" Coke, a suspected drug lord. They were met with violence that has left at least 29 people dead, including police, a soldier and many civilians. The government said Wednesday that more than 500 people were in custody. Some people, however, were attempting to get back to business on Wednesday. ""I think by now most people have started to get over the initial shock,"" iReporter Jason Alliman told CNN in an e-mail. ""Most schools are in session, exams are still being held, businesses have started to reopen. People are still a little tense about the whole situation, but I think that's due more to uncertainty about what will happen next than [the] actual threat of violence."" But the florist believes the violence could go on for weeks. ""That's unnerving because everything's being drawn to a standstill. Business was already bad before this because of the recession. Now it's come to a standstill,"" she told CNN by phone from Kingston. The florist said she thinks the government could have moved sooner against Coke, possibly avoiding the situation it now finds itself in. ""The government's trying to fix the problem, but it didn't have to reach this point. They could have dealt with this earlier,"" she said. At the moment, the violence seems mostly to have passed, but many people still do not dare to go out, they said. One resident of nearby Port Royal said by telephone that people are staying out of Kingston -- even failing to show up for work or school -- because they do not want to get caught in violence. ""I can't venture to town. I have business that I need to take care of,"" said the man, adding that there are no banks in Port Royal. The man said that at the restaurant where he works, business is down ""99 percent for the past four days,"" since the violence began. People can get essentials in Port Royal, but many go into Kingston to shop, he said, declining to give his name. At St. Andrews High School for Girls in Kingston, a spokeswoman said the school was open, but that most teachers and students had not showed up. Alliman, who lives in Red Hills, St. Andrew, outside the city, wrote that he went out to give blood Tuesday, and ""even well into the evening when I was returning home, I wasn't overly anxious about being on Red Hills Road, where a lot of shooting had been taking place only a couple days ago."" Some restaurants on the road were still open as he was driving past about 6:30 or 7 p.m., he said. Alliman on Monday submitted an iReport photo taken from his balcony showing smoke rising from a fire in Kingston. He said he hadn't left home on Wednesday, but ""at the very least I haven't heard any more gunshots from here."" Violet Dias, an American citizen from New York, said Tuesday she was locked down in her home in Kingston's Tivoli Gardens neighborhood because of the violence. ""They shot up the front of my house,"" she said. Police had taken her nephew and grandson for questioning, she said. ""We did not have any [electricity] yesterday, but it came back. We have no food,"" she said. ""We can't get anything to eat."" Dias, an amputee and an asthmatic, is due to return to the United States on June 14, she said. The manager of a food distribution company said his business was weathering the upheaval and that things were ""getting back to normal."" ""Right now it's pretty calm... But people -- especially yesterday -- mostly were cautious and taking the necessary precautions,"" he said by phone, asking that his name not be used. He said there's been a ""mixed response"" to the government's handling of the situation. But, he said, most people ""want the security forces to do what they have to do.""","Situation similar to after 9/11 attacks on U.S. one Kingston resident says .

"(CNN) -- Chile's Supreme Court has ruled that former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori can be extradited to Peru on five corruption and two human rights abuse charges. Former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori has denied all allegations, calling them politically motivated. Alberto Chaigneau, a court judge, made the announcement about the order on Chilean TV on Friday. Gabriel Zaliasnek, Fujimori's defense attorney, later said that the ""decision of the Supreme Court should be respected and will be respected."" It is not known when the extradition will take place. But the wheels for extradition were set in motion a couple of months ago. A Chilean prosecutor in June recommended that Fujimori be extradited to Peru to face the charges. He was then placed under house arrest in his home in the suburbs of the Chilean capital, Santiago while awaiting a Supreme Court ruling. Before moving to Chile, Fujimori had fled Peru for Japan, where he holds dual citizenship, as his decade-long presidency neared its end in 2000. Japan refused to honor Peru's request to return him for trial, saying its nationals should be subject to Japanese law and pointing out the two countries have no extradition treaty. He attempted to resign from the presidency by fax from Japan, but Peru's congress refused to accept it, instead declaring him morally unfit to govern. He arrived in Chile in 2005, in what some saw as a possible attempt to return to Peru and seek office there in 2006. He was under house arrest for six months in Chile, but authorities lifted the restriction last year on the condition he not leave the country. Peru has alleged Fujimori ordered death-squad killings and participated in various acts of government corruption. He has denied all the allegations, calling them politically motivated.

"(CNN) -- Passenger David Martin knew the situation on Virgin America Flight 404 was unraveling Saturday when members of the flight crew began snapping at passengers. One incident stands out for him from Saturday's flight, which spent more than four hours on the tarmac at New York's Stewart Airport after being diverted from New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. Martin said he was rationing a limited number of cookies from first-class to mothers and children in coach when a passenger prone to outbursts asked him for a cookie. He was about to give her one when a flight attendant ordered her to sit down and told her she would not get a cookie. ""Everyone knew she was a very frantic woman, which is why no one said anything when she asked for the cookie. ... Everyone understood but the flight attendant,"" said Martin, CEO of the social networking site Kontain.com, who documented Saturday's travails using visual updates via the iPhone app to his Kontain account. ""I went to her and said, you need to understand that speaking to passengers like this is not going to do any good. You need to exercise leadership and responsibility."" Martin said the flight attendant dismissed his words, as did the pilot when he took his concerns to the cockpit. See Martin's visual posts from flight on Kontain.com . Martin said the situation did not improve until the flight was finally canceled, 4½ hours after it parked at Stewart and nearly 12 hours after it took off from Los Angeles International, during which time passengers say they endured shortages of food and water, crying babies, panic attacks and rising tensions. Severe storms and heavy winds paralyzed traffic entering and leaving JFK airport Saturday night, causing most flights to be diverted. ""Although we cannot control the weather or the circumstances, we agreed that we needed to have done a better job with making our guests more comfortable in a difficult situation,"" Virgin America spokeswoman Abby Lunardini said in an e-mail. But if the delay had occurred a few weeks later, Virgin America might have faced more than $3 million in fines for staying on the tarmac for more than three hours. Under the rule, which takes effect April 29, airlines could be fined up to $27,500 per passenger for tarmac delays lasting more than three hours. Passengers were offered two opportunities to leave the plane after it parked on the tarmac at Stewart, and 20 of the 126 passengers chose to do so, Lunardini said. Internal policy dictates that Virgin America will never hold guests longer than three hours without the ability to leave the aircraft, she said. ""Although guests were able to leave the aircraft during Flight 404, if the ruling were in place we would have made the decision to cancel at the 2-hour mark instead of the 3- to 4-hour mark, which is our current practice,"" Lunardini said. ""We are in full compliance with existing rules and are prepared to be in full compliance with the new ruling when it is issued."" The Department of Transportation is investigating the Virgin America incident, said spokesman Bill Mosley. ""The whole thrust behind the rule is to prevent passengers from being subject to that, to the delays in the aircraft,"" Mosley said. American Airlines has joined JetBlue and Delta in requesting an exemption at JFK airport to the tarmac delay rule set, according to the Department of Transportation. The closure of a major runway at JFK prompted the exemption requests, which would only apply to that airport for the duration of construction on the runway. Even in situations when the flight cannot operate, the rule would ensure that passengers are allowed to get off the plane and return to the terminal, Mosley said. American echoed the concerns of JetBlue and Delta in its JFK exemption request. ""Carriers, faced with increased operational difficulties as a result of constrained runway capacity just at the time the new tarmac delay rule goes into effect, and with the prospect of incurring $27,500 per passenger in fines, will inevitably cancel flights during challenging operational situations,"" the airline's DOT request said. Martin said he supports the idea of fining airlines for delays as an incentive to ensure that other passengers don't have to endure the same experience. ""I would like on my left to be the CEO of Virgin America and on my right, the CEO of JetBlue to vouch with me for this bill,"" he said. ""That's the kind of leadership that's required and demonstrates that these CEOs understand that passenger safety and customer service comes first."" Martin and his seatmate, ""Dancing with the Stars"" judge Carrie Ann Inaba, used Twitter and Kontain, respectively, to issue updates on their ordeal. ""Was stuck on a plane for five hours on a Tarmac. They ran out of food, a woman was escorted off by police and I'm grateful to new friends,"" Inaba tweeted at 11:14 p.m., after the flight was officially canceled and remaining passengers were led off the plane. Read Inaba's Tweets . Martin posted intermittent updates to Kontain.com using his iPhone app while the flight was in progress. ""Tensions rising big time as we are grounded and passengers are trying to get off,"" he said in one post accompanied by a photo of passengers lining up in front of the cockpit to deplane. ""Virgin crew losing control of passengers. Police now onboard here,"" he said in a later post. On Sunday night, Martin says he received a phone call from Virgin America CEO David Cush telling him that he'd seen his posts and expressing apologies.

""You can't just write in a complaint or call customer service anymore... social media, it's the only weapon,"" he said. ""Airlines need to be more terrified of that than the actual bill, because they're going to have to compensate passengers anyway each time they get held up on the tarmac, but they're also going to lose passengers because their brand will be destroyed every time a passenger uses social media.""","Five-hour flight lasts more than 10 after severe weather diverts it .

"Editor's note: The staff at CNN.com has recently been intrigued by the journalism of VICE, an independent media company and website based in Brooklyn, New York. VBS.TV is VICE's broadband television network. The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a very transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- In 2008, the world cast its eyes on Beijing, the sprawling Chinese metropolis that was set to play host to the Summer Olympics. At VBS.TV, we caught wind of another story that soon had our full attention. As Chinese officials were taking unprecedented and often controversial measures to sanitize the notoriously foul Beijing air, much of the rest of the country was still covered in a thick blanket of noxious smog. According to a World Bank survey at the time, 16 of the world's 20 most-polluted cities were in China. At the top of that list is the city of Linfen, a coal-mining and manufacturing hub in the heart of Shanxi Province. Within weeks, we assembled a film crew and went off to the landlocked province in northern China to find out more. After touching down in Beijing and making a quick visit to the Olympic countdown clock, we set out to visit the single most polluted place on Earth, hoping to place the dubious ranking into a human context. Despite the Chinese government's promise of a marathon-friendly city, the Beijing air at the time was still plenty oppressive. But nothing could have prepared us for the dystopian scenario we encountered during our week in Linfen and the surrounding area. See the rest of Toxic Linfen at VBS.TV . Before the trip, I had researched thousands of images of the pollution that plagues Linfen and Shanxi province, but to see it in person is, quite simply, devastating. The sun sets before it is supposed to, disappearing into a curtain of smog above the true horizon. Residents scavenge the roadside for coal that falls from the seemingly endless cavalcade of coal trucks, gathering it with bare hands. Schoolchildren play against the nonstop backdrop of billowing exhaust. Many of the elderly have trouble speaking between gasps of widespread emphysema. Residents of Linfen are aware of the growing threat the polluted air and water pose, and some of them have left the city. Most, however, have no choice but to stay. The infamy of a No. 1 ranking in the news media eventually motivated China to focus more attention on cleaning up Linfen, but unfortunately, the scene of overwhelming pollution is still rampant in many parts of the country. As easy as it is to criticize China's bold industrial development, our visit was also a clear reminder of the same pattern of manufacturing and consumption that has occurred elsewhere since the dawn of the Industrial Age. In China, it just happens to be on a much grander scale and on the back of a globalized economy that has rendered China into an assembly line for the world. The most compelling research I came across to this end are recently published studies showing particulate matter from China's factories and mines reaching across the Pacific Ocean to North America's West Coast. China obviously has some cleaning up to do, and more importantly, some major strategizing to achieve a sustainable economy. Our futures are inextricably linked. Back in New York City, the coal mines of Shanxi Province feel worlds away, but as oil now gushes ceaselessly into our own backyard, we should pay even more attention to Linfen if we don't want it to be a glimpse into our own future.","The city of Linfen has a permanent toxic smog hovering over the city .

"New York (CNN) -- Emmy-winning ""Golden Girls"" actress Rue McClanahan died of a stroke in a New York hospital early Thursday, her manager said. She was 76. McClanahan, who suffered a cerebral hemorrhage last Monday, was surrounded by family when she died at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, according to manager Barbara Lawrence. The actress' career began on the New York stage in the 1950s, but her long television career was first boosted when producer Norman Lear cast McClanahan in his hit CBS series ""All in the Family"" in 1971. She appeared in Lear's ""Maude"" a year later. Her most memorable TV role was as Southern belle Blanche Devereaux on ""The Golden Girls,"" which ran from 1985 through 1992. McClanahan won an Emmy for best lead actress in a comedy in 1987. Betty White is the last surviving member of the four ""Golden Girls"" stars. ""Rue was a close and dear friend,"" White said Thursday. ""I treasured our relationship. It hurts more than I even thought it would, if that's possible."" Estelle Getty passed away in 2008, and Bea Arthur died last year. McClanahan requested that no funeral be held for her, but memorial services will be announced for later this summer in New York and Los Angeles, California, Lawrence said. Fans can pay their respects online, a family statement said. ""Please join us in celebrating Rue's amazing life"" by visiting a memorial page established for her on Facebook, the family said. McClanahan's last comedic TV role was in an episode of Tyler Perry's ""Meet the Browns,"" taped in 2009. She carried the Devereaux character to three other TV series, including ""The Golden Palace,"" ""Empty Nest"" and ""Nurses."" She was married six times and had one child. Her son, Mark Bish, was born in 1958 during a brief first marriage. Her present marriage to Morrow Wilson, starting in 1997, was her longest. Her book ""My First Five Husbands ... And the Ones Who Got Away"" was published in 2007. McClanahan was born in Healdton, Oklahoma, on February 21, 1934, to parents with Scottish and native American heritage.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Britain's Prince Andrew on Wednesday defended comments he made suggesting the United States might have been better off had its leaders learned from the British experience with colonialism before invading Iraq. Prince Andrew says he has accepted that his comments could be interpreted as controversial. ""The fact is that we have learned, sometimes at our expense, in the years when we were a colonial power,"" he told CNN. ""So there may or may not have been things and ideas that were of valid use to what was going on at that particular time."" The 47-year-old prince, in Atlanta on a 10-day U.S. tour to promote British business, said the two countries are closely allied. ""We've been allies, for goodness' sake, for how long?"" he said.  Watch him discuss his new role » . ""We are now working very much more closely together than we have over the centuries, apart from when we were very, very close during the second World War."" The Duke of York cited U.S.-British anti-terrorism efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan as an area where the two countries are working together to promote stability and change. The New York Times last week quoted the prince as saying there are ""occasions when people in the U.K. would wish that those in responsible positions in the U.S. might listen and learn from our experiences."" He added, ""If you are looking at colonialism, if you are looking at operations on an international scale, if you are looking at understanding each other's culture, understanding how to operate in a military insurgency campaign -- we have been through them all."" The problems faced by U.S. war planners in Iraq have bred ""healthy skepticism"" toward what comes out of Washington, he told the newspaper. In his CNN interview Wednesday, Andrew said he did not consider those comments controversial when he made them, but has since accepted how they could be interpreted that way. Still, the Falklands War veteran who served 22 years in the Royal Navy added, ""You have to take the bashes with the good bits, and I've got a thick skin."" Asked whether he believes the situation in Iraq is improving, Andrew said he could not answer what he described as ""almost a university Ph.D. question."" ""I don't think I can possibly predict those sorts of ways that governments work to each other,"" he said. ""I'm only a small cog in a very, very large machine."" The main purpose of his visit is to promote business investment in Britain, he said. Of the approximately 1,000 investment projects that were begun last year in Britain, more than half came from the United States, resulting in the addition of more than 32,000 jobs, he said. ""Now I realize that what keeps us all going is international commerce, it's global trade,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- If director Ron Howard hopes religious controversy will help sell tickets to ""Angels & Demons"" the way it boosted his ""Da Vinci Code,"" the Catholic Church is not playing along with his script. Tom Hanks reprises his role as professor Robert Langdon in ""Angels & Demons."" Howard, who premiered the follow-up in Rome, Italy, this week, said there was ""residual antagonism from 'The Da Vinci Code,' "" but Vatican officials ignored the movie by not responding to suggestions that the church was offended. The first movie based on Dan Brown's mega-selling novels earned $750 million worldwide in 2006. ""The Da Vinci Code"" was intensely criticized by Catholics, especially those from the Opus Dei organization, a small but influential group within the Catholic Church whose members felt that they were vilified in the story. An Opus Dei priest who teaches history and literature at Holy Cross University in Rome said that ""Angels & Demons"" has ""simply not been an issue"" among those in the Vatican and that any controversy is a product of the movie's marketing machine.  Watch Howard make his statements » . ""To be honest, I don't think that anyone at the Vatican is paying much attention to the premier of the 'Angels & Demons,' "" Father John Wauck said. ""I was just talking with some people yesterday, I know friends of mine working in the Vatican, and they were surprised to learn that the movie was premiering in Rome. They had no idea."" ""I think the church's attitude has been, from the beginning, 'hands off,' "" Wauck said. ""Especially, I think, after what happened with 'The Da Vinci Code.' "" The new movie is not as offensive, Wauck said. ""In 'The Da Vinci Code,' there were serious issues, such as who Jesus Christ was or the nature of church in the course of history, but none of them is taken in 'Angels & Demons.' It's simply, you know, a thriller,"" he said. The movie may even help Rome by promoting tourism there, which is ""not a bad thing,"" Wauck said. But Howard suggested to CNN's Neil Curry that controversy has carried over to the sequel. ""I think there's some residual antagonism from 'The Da Vinci Code,' "" Howard said. Stirring people up with controversy is ""something that appeals to me,"" he said. ""Part of the entertainment value is that people are going to go in there and have something to talk about or think about afterward,"" he said. Howard said he tried to reach out to the Catholic Church. ""We've even invited certain groups, members of the church, for example, to see early rough cuts, because I wanted to share it with them and know what they thought, and I felt they'd find it not as offensive as they'd imagine,"" he said. ""Everyone's declined to do that."" Howard himself downplayed reports that Rome and Vatican officials hampered production by refusing permission to film in certain locations. ""Probably a little more has been made of that,"" he said. ""While I don't want to reveal how we took people on the 'Angels & Demons' tour and on the adventure, someday I might, maybe on the DVD or something, do a little better breakdown of how we got the shots we needed,"" he said. Producers did resort to some ""low-budget street photography where you just pull up in a car, getting out of a van, clearing a little space and shooting a shot,"" Howard said. This controversy, Wauck said, was also cooked up by the film's marketing department. ""As a general rule, no commercial films are filmed in churches in Rome, and no exception was made for 'Angels & Demons,' "" Wauck said. The film, which like ""The Da Vinci Code"" stars Tom Hanks as symbolism professor Robert Langdon, takes the audience inside the Conclave, where cardinals meet secretly to choose a new pope. ""One thing that was important to me and to all of us was to be as authentic as we possibly could be about what Conclave was like, that period when they're trying to elect the pope,"" Howard said. ""It's a complete mystery. Outsiders are not allowed in. They stop rolling even their own Vatican archival footage when they lock the cardinals into the Sistine Chapel."" Set designers used old paintings and photos to recreate the scene, he said. ""I wanted to represent for the audience that with as much detail as I did going to the moon with 'Apollo 13,' "" he said, referring to his 1995 movie about the aborted space mission. ""Angels & Demons"" is the second of Brown's Langdon novels Howard has turned into a film. ""There are so many reasons to do it, and when I really looked at 'Angels & Demons' and realized that it was going to feel different,"" he said. ""It was going to sound different. It was going to be paced in a completely different way because this is a real bona fide thriller. This is Langdon in jeopardy. There's a ticking bomb. You know, it's a murder mystery."" Howard said he will wait to decide whether he will make a movie based on Brown's third Langdon novel. ""While I haven't read Dan's next installment of the Robert Langdon adventures, I'm dying to,"" he said. ""I'll also look to see how audiences respond to 'Angels & Demons.' They're going to tell us a lot."" ""Angels & Demons"" opens in U.S. theaters May 15.

"(CNN) -- When opposition rugby teams line up against the New Zealand All Blacks, there's a common game plan: Get Carter. New Zealand rugby player Dan Carter is on course to be the country's top points scorer. Playing as number 10 in the fly half position, Carter is the All Blacks' creative talisman and the one player that can catch the eye with his skill and control a match with his reading of the game. He made his debut for the All Blacks in 2003 at just 21-years-old, but really burst onto the international scene in 2005 during the British Lions tour of New Zealand. It led his opposite number, English fly-half Jonny Wilkinson, who won the World Cup with England in 2003, to call Carter the most complete player in that position, combining great natural talent with an excellent work ethic. As well as the accolades from journalists and fellow players he also picked up the International Rugby Board's Player of the year award in 2005. Growing up around Christchurch on New Zealand's south island, he's been an integral member of the Crusaders team since 2002 and helped to make them the most successful team in the Super 14 competition, the southern hemisphere's top club league. Having been courted by numerous British club sides for years, he's now taking the opportunity to play on pastures new, but with French club Perpignan. He'll be in the Catalan city for six months, and regardless of how well he does on the field, he'll set new records by becoming the best paid player in club rugby. He's set to earn an estimated $50,000 per game, which in a sport that lags far behind football or American sports in terms of finance is big money. Find out what he thinks about playing his club rugby abroad for the first time, his view on the All Blacks and what it's like to be a rugby-playing pin-up on Talk Asia this week.","New Zealand rugby player made international debut as a 21-year-old .

"(CNN) -- Injuries continue to strike down the planet's top football players ahead of this month's World Cup in South Africa, with Dutch star Arjen Robben's participation in doubt and key Nigeria midfielder Jon Obi Mikel forced to withdraw. Robben, whose inspired form this season took German club Bayern Munich to the final of the Champions League, has not joined his teammates in flying to Africa after suffering a hamstring injury on Saturday. He scored two goals after coming on as a second-half substitute in a 6-1 friendly romp over Hungary in Amsterdam, but needs a scan on Sunday after hurting himself trying to execute a fancy backheel pass. ""I would rather lose this match and have Arjen stay fit,"" Netherlands coach Bert van Marwijk said on Dutch Web site www.vi.nl. ""He felt a sharp pain. That does not bode well. But I do not lose hope."" Robben had returned to action after missing Tuesday's 4-1 international friendly rout over Ghana in Rotterdam on Tuesday. Earlier on Saturday, Nigeria officials reported that Mikel has decided he has not recovered sufficiently from knee surgery, meaning he joins teammates Michael Ballack (Germany), Michael Essien (Ghana) and Jose Bosingwa (Portugal) from his English club Chelsea in missing the tournament. The 23-year-old Mikel missed the end of Chelsea's season, which culminated in a league and cup double. ""We have dropped Mikel from the World Cup squad after he told the team he did not want to put his career at risk as his knee injury has yet to fully heal after a recent surgery,"" Nigeria team official Emmanuel Attah said in quotes carried by the Chelsea Web site. Another Chelsea player, Ivory Coast striker Didier Drogba, may also be sidelined for the month-long event after suffering an elbow injury against Japan on Friday. He had a ""successful"" operation in Switzerland on Saturday, according to Ivory Coast officials, but they could not yet say if he would be fit to take part. Mikel followed England captain Rio Ferdinand in being denied a chance to play on soccer's biggest stage, with the defender suffering a knee injury on Friday. He has been replaced in the 23-man squad by Tottenham defender Michael Dawson, with Liverpool midfielder Steven Gerrard taking over as skipper and Chelsea's Frank Lampard named as his deputy by coach Fabio Capello. World champions Italy also have an injury problem, with key midfielder Andrea Pirlo suffering a calf injury against Mexico on Thursday. The 31-year-old has been ruled out of Saturday night's final friendly against Switzerland, and is battling to be fit for the Azzurri's Group F opener game against Paraguay on June 14. Marcello Lippi's team came from behind to draw 1-1, with striker Fabio Quagliarella's 15th-minute goal canceling out Gokhan Inler's opener. Slovakia defender Martin Skrtel also suffered an injury blow on Saturday when he had to go off in the 16th minute of the 3-0 friendly win over Costa Rica after damaging his ankle. The center-back, who plays for English club Liverpool, had previously played only once since breaking a bone in his foot in February. He is expected to be fit for the World Cup after resting his injury. In Saturday's other friendlies, the United States beat fellow qualifiers Australia 3-1 with two goals from Edson Buddle and another from fellow forward Herculez Gomez, who came on as a substitute. The 29-year-old Buddle, starting in place of the injured Jozi Altidore, netted his first goals for his country as he continued the form that has him at the top of the Major League Soccer goalscoring charts this season. Midfielder Tim Cahill leveled for Australia in the 19th minute. Hosts South Africa notched another morale-boosting win by beating fellow qualifiers Denmark 1-0 in Atteridgeville, as striker Katlego Mphela netted his fourth goal in three matches in the 76th minute. Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira's team will kick off the tournament against Mexico in Johannesburg's new Soccer City stadium on Friday. Ghana won 1-0 against Latvia in England with a late goal from substitute striker Quincy Owusu-Abeyie. Ghana gave a full debut to Germany under-21 international midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng, whose half-brother Jerome is joining English club Manchester City from Hamburg on a five-year contract from July 1. The duo, who have a Ghanaian father, could play against each other in South Africa when Germany face the Black Stars in their final Group D match on June 23. Serbia beat fellow finalists Cameroon 4-3, with six goals coming in the first half. Striker Pierre Webo put the Africans 2-1 up after 20 minutes before Dejan Stankovic leveled five minutes later. Nenad Milijas scored a penalty and Marko Pantelic scored in successive minutes just before halftime, while Eric Choupo-Moting reduced the deficit on 67. Algeria beat the United Arab Emirates 1-0 with a second-half penalty from Karim Ziani, ending a run of four successive defeats. Honduras slumped to a 3-0 defeat by Romania, who did not qualify for the finals.","Dutch star Arjen Robben in doubt for World Cup after suffering hamstring injury .

"New York (CNN) -- Tuesday's Supreme Court decision in Berghuis v. Thompkins -- holding that, after being informed of their rights, suspects must explicitly tell police that they want to stay silent to invoke their Miranda protections -- indeed turns Miranda ""upside down,"" as one dissenting justice put it. Its potential consequences are as predictable as night following day: Police will interrogate criminal suspects who do not explicitly invoke their rights -- often, those will be suspects who are unsophisticated, poorly educated or mentally ill -- for hours on end. This will lead, just as inevitably, to more coerced -- and therefore unreliable -- confessions. And this will result in wrongful incarceration and diminish our collective security. This is the very phenomenon that Miranda aimed to eliminate. To be sure, the ruling is a setback for the protections designed to ensure an effective criminal justice system (Miranda requires police officers to inform suspects of the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney). But there is one silver lining in Berghuis' cloud: The ruling demonstrates that the Supreme Court is not shy about curtailing Miranda protections, even without prodding from Congress. Hence the ruling should derail Congress' recent calls to enact an unnecessary, likely overbroad and possibly unconstitutional statute further restricting Miranda's requirements. The issue arose when Attorney General Eric Holder, among others, called on lawmakers to step in and limit Miranda by expanding the ""public safety exception."" That exception allows law enforcement officials to interrogate suspected terrorists for a limited time before advising them of their Miranda rights -- if the officers are ""reasonably prompted by a concern for public safety."" But this call for codifying has always been somewhat baffling, as it is so clearly not needed. Expanding of the public safety exception legislatively may score political points for lawmakers or government officials bent on appearing tough on terrorism, but such action would not improve the efficacy of our counterterrorism policy. In fact, the public safety exception in its current form has proved extremely effective in allowing law enforcement the necessary flexibility in questioning terror suspects. After two recent attempted terror attacks, both the ""underwear bomber"" suspect, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, and ""Times Square bomber"" suspect Faisal Shahzad were questioned under the public safety exception. They both reportedly provided interrogators with valuable intelligence during that time and continued to do so even after being advised of their rights. As the attorney general himself observed, ""the giving of Miranda warnings has not stopped these terror suspects from talking to us. They have continued to talk even though we have given them a Miranda warning."" Legislation on the public safety exception is also risky. While courts consider the issues that come to them on a case-by-case basis, deciding what the law requires in the context of a particular set of circumstances, Congress must act in the abstract, imagining a variety of situations that might occur and attempting to draft a law able to address each of them. Thus any congressional attempt to define the scope of the public safety exception, especially in a political environment dominated by a sense that the next terrorist attempt might occur at any moment, is likely to overreach. Moreover, we know from the 2000 case Dickerson v. United States, which struck down a law aimed at limiting the scope of Miranda, that the Supreme Court will draw the line on curtailing Miranda's protections. Thus any statute passed now to expand or codify the exception runs the risk of judicial invalidation. The result would be that any convictions secured through confessions elicited under the invalidated law would be reversed. Today's decision, however, removes any doubt about whether Congress should take action. It should not. Without Congress ever introducing a bill or taking a single vote, the Supreme Court just expanded significantly law enforcement officials' ability to interrogate at length all criminal suspects, terrorists or otherwise, even after they have been properly Mirandized. Until suspected terrorists unambiguously assert their desire to remain silent, government officials may continue to interrogate them for hours or even days, using any statement they make against them in subsequent prosecution. Moreover, this decision sends a strong signal: While it might look with hostility on congressional attempts to rein in the scope of the Miranda rule, the Supreme Court itself is willing to interpret narrowly the protections that Miranda affords criminal defendants. And it is willing to reach relatively far to do so. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Emily Berman.","Emily Berman says Supreme Court ruling easing up on Miranda protections is setback .
But, she says, it should cause Congress to back off on legislating Miranda changes .
Congress stepping in on Miranda risks political overreach, court challenges, she says .
Berman: Court has shown it's willing to make own narrow interpretation on Miranda ."
"(Mashable) -- It seems that yet another member of the animal kingdom has taken a liking to the iPad -- dolphins. Cats love it and dogs aren't so sure, but apparently a bottlenose dolphin named Merlin is now an iPad enthusiast. Researcher Jack Kassewitz of SpeakDolphin is working on using the Apple tablet device as a language interface for marine mammals. ""We think that once the dolphins get the hang of the touch screen, we can let them choose from a wide assortment of symbols to represent objects, actions and even emotions,"" Kassewitz said of the project. ""Merlin is quite curious, like most dolphins, and he showed complete willingness to examine the iPad."" The young two-year-old Merlin (not the first two-year-old to enjoy the device!) is reportedly able to use his snout to touch photos of objects on the iPad's touchscreen after being shown their real-world counterparts.

"(Mashable) -- The AP Stylebook has released its new social media guidelines, including the official change from""Web site"" to ""website"" (a move first reported back in April) and 41 other definitions, use cases and rules that journalists should follow. Among the more interesting changes -- at least from a grammar and style standpoint -- are separating out ""smart phone"" as two words, hyphenating ""e-reader,"" and allowing fan, friend and follow to be used both as nouns and verbs. Beyond that, the AP has also defined a number of acronyms that are commonly used in texting and instant messaging. While most of them should be fairly well-known to regular web and mobile phone users (ROFL, BRB and G2G are among the definitions) one actually was new to me: POS. According to the AP, this stands for ""parent over shoulder"" (I've used POS to refer to something else occasionally, but I digress), and is used by ""teens and children to indicate, in an IM conversation, that a parent is approaching."" Elsewhere, other terms making the cut include ""trending,"" ""retweet"" and ""unfriend"" (""defriend"" is also acceptable, though the AP concludes it's less common). Finally, the AP also offers some basic rules of thumb for how social media should and shouldn't be used by journalists, with a focus on making sure they continue to confirm sources and information they find on blogs, tweets and other forms of social media.

"Muscat, Oman (CNN) -- Cyclone Phet weakened as it churned along coastal Oman Friday, dumping up to 25 centimeters (10 inches) of rain on the region. Phet, once a powerful Category 4 storm, has been downgraded to Category 1 with winds of about 140 km/hr (86 mph), according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. Yet Phet brought massive flooding to Muscat and whipped the capital with winds gusting above 200 km/hr (125 mph) at the height of the storm. The storm is forecast to reenter the Arabian Sea late Friday or early Saturday before making a projected landfall near Karachi, Pakistan, Sunday. In Pakistan, authorities dispatched Navy helicopters to alert fishermen near Karachi and parts of Balochistan to the expected arrival of Cyclone Phet and to urge them to return to shore, the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan reported Thursday. Navy units were on high alert should they be needed in the aftermath of the cyclone. Fourteen families marooned Thursday by high tides were evacuated by helicopter to higher ground, said Pakistani Chief of Naval Staff Adm. Nauman Bashir. Civilians along Pakistan's coast will receive priority in the relief effort, dubbed ""Operation Madad,"" should it be needed, he said.

"(CNN) -- The leading edge of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill was still several miles off the beaches of the Florida Panhandle on Thursday morning, but the slick was already hitting the area's wallets. ""The phones just basically stopped ringing in the past couple of weeks for new bookings this summer,"" said Laura Lee, a spokeswoman for the Pensacola Bay Area Convention and Visitors Bureau. Florida's Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission spotted oil sheen about six miles off Navarre Beach, east of Pensacola, on Thursday morning, according to the state Division of Emergency Management. Any oil that hits shore is likely to have been weathered into balls or mats of tar, or mixed with seawater in a pudding-like ""mousse,"" the agency reported. As of late Thursday morning, no oil or tar balls had washed up, said Buck Lee, executive director of the Santa Rosa Island Authority in Pensacola Beach. Lee, who is not related to Laura Lee, said the area had just had a ""super"" Memorial Day weekend -- but now, ""We're just waiting anxiously to see what happens,"" he added. Laura Lee said a wave of hotel cancellations hit the island in late April, after the sinking of the offshore drill rig Deepwater Horizon uncapped an undersea oil well off Louisiana. Those tapered off soon afterward, she said -- ""But this week, there's been another wave of cancellations,"" Laura Lee said. Hotels have responded to the threat by easing cancellation policies. ""Some had guarantees that they would get their money back if there was oil,"" she said. Families weigh Gulf Coast vacations . In addition, charter fishing -- another big business in the area -- has been hurt. Some skippers have gone to work for oil company BP, which has hired boats to help lay protective booms and skim oil off the surface of the Gulf. Tourism pumped about $1.2 billion into the Escambia County economy in 2009, employing roughly 20,000 people and bringing about 3.5 million overnight visitors a year, according to tourism officials. Early July brings two of its biggest annual events -- the Independence Day holiday and the following weekend's Pensacola Beach air show, which features the locally based Navy aerobatic team, the Blue Angels. Faced with those concerns, the locals are trying to harness the power of technology and social media to offset the threat. ""We're encouraging our visitors who are currently here to post their vacation pictures on Facebook, and a lot of them have done that just so that visitors can see with their own eyes the oil hasn't hit,"" Laura Lee said. And Buck Lee said the island authority hopes to put cameras on the beach and video streaming on the internet within about two weeks, ""so they can see for themselves whether there's oil on the beach or not."" ""And there may be,"" he said. ""But we've got to get them the facts.""","Tourism pumped about $1.2 billion into Pensacola, Florida-area economy last year .

"(CNN) -- He was known as the Wizard of Westwood, the architect of a dynasty at UCLA that will never be equaled. But John Wooden leaves behind a legacy much larger than victories on a basketball court. Wooden died Friday of natural causes at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. He was 99. His 100th birthday would have been October 14. Wooden's children, Nan and Jim Wooden, issued a statement asking that donations be made in his name to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation or another charity of choice. ""He has been, and always will be, the guiding light for our family. The love, guidance and support he has given us will never be forgotten,"" the said. ""Our peace of mind at this time is knowing that he has gone to be with our mother, whom he has continued to love and cherish."" Wooden had been admitted to the hosptial on May 26. Funeral services will be private, but the family said there would be a public memorial at a later date, with a reception for former players and coaches. ""There will never be another John Wooden,"" said UCLA Director of Athletics Dan Guerrero. ""While this is a huge loss for the Bruin family, Coach Wooden's influence reaches far beyond Westwood. Coach was a tremendously significant figure. ""This loss will be felt by individuals from all parts of society. He was not only the greatest coach in the history of any sport but he was an exceptional individual that transcended the sporting world. His enduring legacy as a role model is one we should all strive to emulate."" ""This is a sad day at UCLA,"" said UCLA Chancellor Gene Block. ""Coach Wooden's legacy transcends athletics; what he did was produce leaders."" Wooden was born on a farm in Martinsville, Indiana, in 1910 and learned to play basketball on an iron hoop that his father had forged and attached to the barn. He went to college at Purdue, winning All-America honors three times and leading the Boilermakers to the 1932 national collegiate championship. After marrying his high school sweetheart and life-long love Nell following his graduation, Wooden coached at the high school level and at Indiana State before being hired by UCLA in 1948. His coaching methods, like his upbringing, seemed like something out of a Norman Rockwell painting: Simple, yet elegant. ""If there's anything you could point out where I was a little different, it was the fact that i never mentioned winning,"" he once said. In 27 years at UCLA, his Bruins won an unprecedented 10 national championships in 12 years, including seven straight from 1967 to 1973. UCLA also captured 19 conference titles and set an NCAA record with 88 consecutive wins over four seasons, but Wooden was more proud of his players accomplishments off the court. ""I think that's the factor from which i have received the greatest satisfaction and pleasure. The fact that practically all of my players did get their degrees and practically all of them have done well in whatever their chosen profession might be,"" he said. Wooden retired from UCLA in 1975, following his 10th national championship but would occasionally take in a Bruins game from the stands. Former Cal coach Pete Newell once said, ""John was a better coach at 55 than he was at 50. He was a better coach at 60 than at 55. He's a true example of a man who learned from day one to day last."" Wooden is a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame both as a coach and as a player -- one of only two men to attain that honor -- and many of the men he coached went on to stellar careers as well. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (then Lew Alcindor), Gail Goodrich and Bill Walton all landed in the Basketball Hall of Fame beside their college coach, while others played in the NBA or even returned to UCLA later in Wooden's footsteps. But Wooden's legacy extended beyond his basketball expertise -- he coached leadership. He frequently recited what he termed his father's ""two sets of three"" -- ""never lie, never cheat, never steal"" and ""don't whine, don't complain, don't make excuses."" And his well-known ""Pyramid of Success,"" begun in the 1930s, has been the system behind the success of many. ""His 'Pyramid of Success' hangs in my office to remind me every day of what it takes to be an effective leader,"" Block said. ""He was truly a legend in his own time, and he will be a legend for generations to come."" Wooden himself called the pyramid ""the only truly original thing I have ever done."" The base of his five-level pyramid is made up of industriousness, friendship, loyalty, cooperation and enthusiasm. The next levels up are self-control, alertness, initiative and intentness, then condition, skill and team spirit followed by and poise and confidence. At the pinnacle is competitive greatness, which he defined as performing at top ability when that is required -- ""each day."" ""Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to become the best of which you are capable,"" Wooden once said in explaining the pyramid.","NEW: UCLA AD: ""There will never be another John Wooden""

"(CNN) -- The notoriously private Janet Jackson opened up about her brother's death on ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"" Friday, admitting that the family knew he had a problem. ""People think we were in denial but we weren't. We tried intervention several times. He was very much in denial -- he didn't think he had a problem."" When the news first broke that Michael was ill, Jackson said she first heard about it from an assistant while she was home in New York. The last time she saw her brother was about a month before, she said, at a party she had thrown for their parents. ""He was thin then, and we knew that he had a problem; we all did,"" she said. His death, she told Winfrey, is ""hard to believe still to this day. There isn't a day that goes by that I don't think about it -- that all of us in the family don't think about it -- every single day."" Her brother's passing happened right as Janet Jackson had started production on Tyler Perry's new film, ""Why Did I Get Married Too?"" and the emotional turmoil she was in comes through in the film, Winfrey said. ""It was very therapeutic,"" Jackson said of her role. Tyler Perry, she added, was by her side the entire time, asking her how she wanted to be treated on set, making sure no one had access to images of Jackson crying in character (lest a tabloid run them as evidence of what Jackson was going through at the time), and even changing the ending of the movie, which opens nationwide Friday, for her. ""I changed the ending because at first she was going to speak at the funeral, and the things that she was going to say, it was too eerie,"" Perry, who also was on the show, told Winfrey. ""She didn't want to change it, but I did."" Veering from the topic of his movie, Perry told Winfrey he felt the need to reiterate how hard the Jackson family worked to try to save their brother. ""I'm sorry, but I want people to know this,"" Perry said. ""I want people to know how much they tried. They really, really tried -- the entire family. I want the whole world to know how much they tried."" The family was worried, Jackson said, and did several interventions. At one of them, Jackson said she became so overwhelmed, ""seeing him and knowing that there was an issue that he was in denial about,"" she had to leave the room. ""A lot of the relationships I've been in, they've had issues with addiction. It's difficult when you see it. [I] recognize it so quickly because I've dealt with it in past relationships."" For Jackson, it's difficult to even look at pictures of Michael as an adult or listen to his music; the only images she can stand to view are those of the pair as children. ""When we were kids, we had so much fun together,"" she said. ""We used to spend every day, all day, together. I have a beautiful picture in my home of he and I when we were just babies. It takes me to that place, even when he was still here, that I missed, that we would talk about. That [picture] I can look at."" The emotional turmoil Jackson was dealing with, both in her role in Perry's movie as well as personally, began to affect her physically as well: Jackson said she's definitely an emotional eater. ""When I'm feeling down, I do turn to food,"" she told Winfrey. Her struggle with her weight has even led Jackson to write a book about it, to answer those persistent questions everyone always has about her weight. ""Instead of writing about nutrition, I decided to go into my childhood, where I've always had issues with my weight,"" Jackson said, adding that the book would touch on issues like self-confidence as well.","Janet Jackson opens up about her new movie and life after her brother's death .

"(CNN) -- Ted Haggard, the former megachurch pastor and former National Association of Evangelicals chief whose career was undone by a gay prostitution and drugs scandal in 2006, plans to start a new church. Standing in front of his barn, Haggard and his family announced Wednesday that they are starting a church in Colorado Springs, Colorado, called Saint James. The church, which will not be affiliated with any denomination, will have its first gathering Sunday at the Haggard home. ""All are welcome. Whether you're a Democrat, a Republican, gay, straight, bi-[sexual], tall, short, addict, recovering addict. ... I believe Jesus' arms are open to all,"" he said. In 2006, Haggard acknowledged having received a massage from a Denver, Colorado, man who said that the prominent pastor had paid him for sex over three years. Haggard also admitted he had bought methamphetamine but said he threw it away. Those statements led the Board of Overseers at New Life Church to fire Haggard as senior pastor. The church's independent investigative board said he was guilty of ""sexually immoral conduct."" After the allegations were made public, Haggard resigned as president of the influential National Association of Evangelicals, an umbrella group representing more than 45,000 churches with 30 million members. As part of his severance package with New Life Church, Haggard was barred from speaking publicly for a year. After that time elapsed, he made various media appearances, including starring in a documentary on HBO about his life. Sunday's service will mark his first return to the ministry in a full-time capacity. ""This is an emotional morning for me,"" he told reporters. Flanked by his wife Gayle and their children and grandchildren, he said the family members had prayed long and hard before deciding to start another church. ""While many believe I am not qualified, nor will I ever be because of what we've been through, I may be qualified to help other people in need,"" Haggard said. ""I don't expect to have another megachurch. I'll be so pleased if a handful of people join with us. Something is better than nothing, and helping one is better than helping none."" In response to a question, Haggard said he had no plans to perform gay marriages at the new church; that the only marriages he will perform will be between a man and a woman. ""Those are the marriages we'll do in our church,"" he said. ""As for society, that's a different story."" His wife said she backed the move. ""I was not willing to let the scandal be the last chapter in our lives,"" Gayle Haggard told reporters. In a statement, New Life Church said it ""will always be grateful for the many years of dedicated leadership from Ted and Gayle Haggard and we wish their family only the best.""","Ted Haggard's career as a pastor went south after a sex and drugs scandal in 2006 .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Ronide Baduel keeps a broken teacup tucked away for safekeeping. One day, she will look at it, maybe even smile, and recall how life's rhythms shifted with the earth in January. She was unlike many of her Haitian compatriots who were barely squeaking by. She had everything: an education, a decent job as a nurse, a three-bedroom home she rented with her teenage son, who was in school. But when the massive earthquake struck, Baduel's house collapsed. For the first time in her life, she had nothing. She ran through the streets clutching the hand of her injured son, following the crowd to Champs de Mars, a large plaza near the heavily damaged presidential palace. She spent the first night sitting on a low concrete wall. In the morning light, she saw the panicked look in the faces of thousands of people and she thought the worst. ""Life was done,"" she said. ""There was going to be no tomorrow."" She was well-off. But a natural disaster had plunged her to the depths of poverty. Earthquakes are not discriminating. Nor are the makeshift camps that sprouted all over the capital. When CNN first met Baduel, just two weeks after the quake, she was sleeping on dirt, under a few sheets of plastic. She had managed to buy a black faux patent leather handbag in which she kept a few personal items: Shampoo. Soap. A change of clothes. And two wallet-size photos of herself and her son that she rescued from the rubble of her house. There was nothing else in her tent. ""It was as though I had gone to hell,"" she said. Baduel did not know how to live in squalor. It was not as though she had come from Cite Soleil, Port-au-Prince's biggest slum, where many people, even before the earthquake, slept under tarps or on the streets. ""It was harder for middle-class people like me,"" she said. ""It's more difficult for those who had something before. I spent my money on my house, and the rest I saved for the future."" Robbed of her privacy, she struggled to attain some kind of dignity. When the private hospital where she worked, the Clinique de la Sante, reopened, she made sure to bathe there in the morning and then again before leaving for the night. There, she did not have to wash in public. Days turned to weeks. Mornings, afternoons, nights -- they were all the same in the tent city. Nothing to do but endure. Baduel watched the people around her. They were survivors. They lived among flies and filth, but they fed their children and cleaned their tents. They made the most of what they had left: their lives. She understood then that there was a God. And that she, too, had to give thanks that she was not crushed in the rubble and that her son's injury was not life-threatening. She understood that life was not done. At the end of March, after more than two months in the tent city, Baduel moved to her sister's flat when it was deemed safe. There, Baduel began to feel halfway back to having a proper existence. She has the use of a kitchen, a bathroom. When the city's flickering electricity is on, she can even watch a bit of television. She sleeps in a netted tent set up behind a locked gate in the front yard. It zips up tightly. Inside are fresh white linens. In late April, when CNN caught up with her again, she could manage a smile, but anxiety still defined her face. She didn't know yet how she would regain her life. In Haiti, she says, there is no such thing as insurance. No one will pay her a cent for the estimated $20,000 loss in personal property. She understands why impoverished people in the camps do not want to leave. There, at least, they have access to food, water and basic goods distributed by aid agencies. The wealthy fled the country or are able to sustain themselves otherwise. But for those in the middle, the struggle is particularly hard, Baduel says. Last November, her ex-husband died unexpectedly. He used to help pay expenses for her son. To make matters worse, even private hospitals in Port-au-Prince are suffering because people are flocking to public ones for free service. Baduel's monthly income, about $600 before the quake because she worked two jobs, has dipped to about $87, and rents are sky-high because of the demand for housing. But she will never return to a tent and tarp encampment. ""Not me,"" she says with defiance. ""Never."" She despised every moment at Champs de Mars but appreciates the way the experience changed her perspective on life. ""I probably spent too much money on making myself and my surroundings beautiful,"" she says. She wants to say something else, but the words never leave her lips. She hates that her future is so uncertain. If nothing else, she will leave her job and the city in which she was raised and go to live with her father in the town of Jeremie in western Haiti. She has already sent her son to live with another sister in Fontamara, away from central Port-au-Prince. She also sent the broken teacup there. For now, she doesn't need to look at it. She doesn't need any reminders.","After the January Haiti quake, Ronide Baduel had nothing for the first time in her life .

"(CNN) -- Bea Arthur, the actress best known for her roles as television's ""Maude"" and the sardonic Dorothy on ""The Golden Girls,"" has died of cancer, a family spokesman said Saturday. Bea Arthur, right, with ""Golden Girls"" co-star Rue McClanahan in June 2008. She was 86. Spokesman Dan Watt said that Arthur died Saturday morning at her home in Los Angeles, her family by her side. She is survived by her sons Matthew and Daniel and grandchildren Kyra and Violet, he said. No funeral services are currently planned, Watt said, adding that the family asked that donations be made to either the Art Attack Foundation or PETA in lieu of flowers. Arthur's opinionated Maude first appeared on Norman Lear's ""All in the Family"" as Edith Bunker's cousin, and was so popular that Lear created a spin-off series. In the '70s, ""Maude"" was ahead of the social curve, tackling hot topics not usually mentioned on situation comedies -- pornography, race relations and, in an episode titled ""Maude's Dilemma,"" abortion. That episode spawned demonstrations and generated hate mail for Arthur -- when Maude and husband Walter (Bill Macy) decided on that episode they were too old to raise a child. But many saw Maude as an enduring icon for women's liberation -- a big deal for the shy, Jewish girl born Bernice Frankel in New York City. During the Depression, Arthur's family left the Big Apple and opened a clothing store in Cambridge, Maryland. By the time she was 12, Arthur was nearly 5 feet, 10 inches tall, and self-conscious about her height. But she masked her insecurity with comedy and eventually returned to New York to study acting. Along the way, she had a short-lived marriage she never spoke about, but she kept the last name -- Arthur. The young Bea Arthur earned a living singing and doing stage work on Broadway and off-Broadway. Critics delighted in her haughty, serpent-tongued deliveries. Her first television appearance came in 1951 in a long-forgotten series called ""Once Upon a Tune,"" but she quickly made a name for herself with appearances on ""Studio One,"" ""Kraft Television Theatre"" and ""The Sid Caesar Show."" Arthur drew attention in ""Threepenny Opera"" on Broadway with Lotte Lenya, but she really turned heads in 1964 originating the role of Yente the Matchmaker in ""Fiddler on the Roof."" In 1966, Arthur won a Tony Award for the caustic Vera Charles in the play ""Mame,"" playing opposite Angela Lansbury in the title role. Eight years later, she reprised the role in the film version opposite Lucille Ball, but by then she was already well-established as Maude. Arthur left ""Maude"" in 1978, making television and some film appearances afterward. She starred in a short-lived series, ""Amanda's,"" in 1983 and then joined the cast of ""The Golden Girls"" in 1985 with Betty White, Rue McClanahan and Estelle Getty. Her role as Dorothy Zbornak gave Arthur her other major television success as one of four older women living together in Florida. (Getty played Arthur's mother). The role earned Arthur a second Emmy -- the first was for ""Maude."" Arthur left the show after Dorothy remarried at the end of the 1991-92 season. White, McClanahan and Getty continued for another season on the show, renamed ""The Golden Palace,"" but the show lasted only one season without Arthur. Arthur entered semi-retirement after the show ended in 1992, returning to television in sporadic guest appearances and appearing at several celebrity roasts. In the early part of this decade, Arthur appeared in several one-woman shows. Her last stage appearance was in 2006. Her last television appearance was on ""The View"" in 2007.","Actress Bea Arthur dies of cancer at age 86, spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- A 32-year-old Puerto Rican recruiter for a cosmetology school in Chicago, Illinois, accused federal immigration authorities on Thursday of throwing him in jail over the weekend as a result of racial profiling. ""I was just profiled,"" Eduardo Caraballo told CNN in a telephone interview. The incident began on May 18, when police showed up at the building housing the school in the suburban Chicago town of Berwyn. The school is owned by his mother. The building includes a storage area where police found a car that Caraballo said he was storing for a friend -- but which turned out to have been stolen. After 48 hours in police custody, Caraballo was interviewed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent, he said. ""She did not believe I was Puerto Rican because of the way I look and the way I talk,"" he said. ""I guess I have a Mexican accent."" On May 20, he was taken to the Cook County Correctional Center. Authorities there told his mother, Patricia Caraballo, that she could not bail him out because immigration had a hold on him, he said. His mother, who is Mexican, then took her son's birth certificate to immigration authorities, her son said. But immigration officials asked the younger Caraballo to describe his life in Puerto Rico, a U.S. commonwealth; scrutinized the papers brought by his mother; and came away unpersuaded. ""Last time I was in Puerto Rico, I was 18 years old,"" Caraballo said. ""I don't really like Puerto Rico -- or Mexico. I like Chicago. I was raised here."" Finally, on Monday, an ICE supervisor allowed him to leave. ""If it was that simple, why couldn't they do it Friday?"" Caraballo asked. The Rev. Walter L. Coleman, of Lincoln United Methodist Church in Chicago, has taken up Caraballo's cause. ""This was based on a clear case of racial profiling and a clear distrust that would not have been extended to a Caucasian or somebody who was Anglo-American,"" Coleman told reporters Thursday. ""We have an integral connection between racial profiling and discrimination and the prosecution of our broken racial laws,"" he added. ""It's everywhere in this country and it's going to intensify."" Chris Bergin, a lawyer for Familia Latina Unida Ministries and Centro Sin Fronteras, said he was considering taking legal action against the government on behalf of Caraballo. That is an example of what we're facing as we see a broken immigration system that is aimed really at Latinos and aimed at intimidation and aimed at persecution and aimed at discrimination and ultimately aimed at disempowering the entire community in this country,"" Bergin said. In a statement, ICE said it ""places 'detainers' or holds on individuals whom we have reason to believe are in the U.S. in violation of law. Based upon the evidence initially available on this individual, ICE agents placed a detainer on him. However, after ICE confirmed the individual's identity as a U.S. citizen, we immediately canceled the detainer. ""This individual was held in local law enforcement custody over the weekend on an ICE detainer based on initially available information that he was an alien subject to deportation. ICE took custody of him on Monday morning and released him within one hour, after his identity was verified, and the ICE detainer was canceled."" But that explanation didn't placate Bergin. ""They're supposed to be the experts in this and they didn't act like experts,"" he said. ""When it comes to Latinos, what has happened is they have flipped the coin on its head: The burden of proof now is on them to prove that they are legal, that they are citizens. ... That is not what America is about."" And ICE's defense raised eyebrows from Jacqueline Stevens, professor of political science at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, outside Chicago. ""Their defense is only valid if someone is foreign-born,"" she said. ""It's not a valid defense if someone is asserting that they're born in the United States. That's basically kidnapping and false imprisonment."" But such incidents are not unusual, said Stevens, who went through the files of an immigration and refugee rights project and found that 82 cases -- 1 percent of the total -- involved U.S. citizens, most of whom had been held for one to three months. That would translate to 4,000 of the 400,000 people detained last year by ICE, Stevens said. She also tracked 30 cases since 2003 where ICE went a step further and deported U.S. citizens, she said. In one case, it took a man wrongfully deported to Jamaica a decade to put together the paperwork to return to the United States, she said.","Puerto Rican detained over the weekend on ICE orders .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama plans to nominate retired Air Force Lt. Gen. James Clapper to be the new director of national intelligence, a senior U.S. defense official confirmed to CNN Friday. Clapper, now a top Pentagon intelligence official, would replace Dennis Blair, who resigned at the end of last month. The announcement will be made Saturday at the White House, the official said. If confirmed, Clapper will become the nation's fourth DNI in the last five years. The position was created after the September 2001 terrorist attacks to oversee the 16 agencies of the U.S. intelligence community. Clapper, who retired from the Air Force in 1995 after a 32-year career, served as head of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency from September 2001 to June 2006. He has served as the under secretary of defense for intelligence since April 2007. Some political observers have indicated that Clapper's prospects for confirmation on Capitol Hill, however, are questionable. California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the Democratic head of the Senate Intelligence Committe, recently said the ""best thing for the U.S. intelligence community is to have someone with a civilian background in charge."" The ranking Republican on the Intelligence Committe, Missouri Sen. Kit Bond, said he has reservations about Clapper. ""I believe he is too focused on the Defense Department issues and he has tried to block out efforts to give more authority to the DNI,"" Bond said. Bond's counterpart on the House side, Rep. Pete Hoekstra, R-Michigan, also said he believes Clapper is the wrong person, because he is ""not forthcoming, open or transparent"" with Congress. Blair, a retired admiral, was pressured to resign as DNI because of differences with the White House over the scope of his role and turf wars with CIA Director Leon Panetta and other members of the intelligence community. One source familiar with Blair's situation said that from the very beginning, ""the White House did not have the same view (as Blair) of what the DNI should be."" That might be the crux of the problem. The law that created the position of DNI after the 9/11 terrorist attacks is too ""ambiguous,"" said Lee Hamiliton, a former congressman who pushed Congress for intelligence reform. Hamilton, the co-chairman of the 9/11 Commission, recently told a congressional hearing that ""the role of the DNI is not clear ... and as long as you have the ambiguity, you're going to have these agencies fighting for jurisdiction and power."" The DNI needs to be empowered with the budget and personnel authorities to lead the community, otherwise, the director is merely a coordinator, Hamilton said. Some question whether it is possible to change the law, considering the difficulty Congress had in getting the original agreement. Bond said Congress must act to give the DNI clear budget authority and chain of command within the intelligence community. Feinstein has called on the president to define the DNI role and then work with Congress to make it law. Hamilton said a fix is needed now, that it can't wait for the longer-term legislative correction. Hoekstra says changing the law is not the answer. ""If you have great people working together, even in a mediocre structure, they can make things happen. More strengths and authorities in the law doesn't guarantee success,"" he said. There does seem to be widespread agreement on one needed component: presidential action in support of the DNI. Hamilton said the ""burden is on the president now to clarify who is in charge of the intelligence community -- where the final authority lies on the budget, personnel and other matters."" Rep. Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, recently wrote a letter to Obama urging him ""to remove obstacles which may have formed a stumbling block for others who held the DNI position."" John Brennan, the president's chief counterterrorism adviser in the White House, recently said the administration is trying to ensure the intelligence community is ""integrated well and orchestrated well"" by the DNI. ""We want to make sure the DNI's role is clear and is able to optimize the contributions that the intelligence community makes on a daily basis,"" Brennan said.

"(CNN) -- A cop killer and child molester who has been on the U.S. Marshals Service's 15 most-wanted fugitive list for nearly four years was captured early Wednesday, authorities said. Paul Clouston, 73, was taken into custody at a men's group home in Merced, California, said Deputy U.S. Marshal Kevin Connolly. Agents with the fugitive task force ""observed a man resembling Clouston seated in a chair and reading a newspaper,"" said the Marshals Service in a statement. ""He provided a false name three times before he said, 'I'm Paul Clouston and I'm tired of running,' "" Connolly told CNN. ""We always say we go after the worst of the worst, and it doesn't get much worse than this type of predator, "" Connolly added. ""We're happy he's off the streets."" Connolly said a viewer tip to the TV program ""America's Most Wanted"" led agents to the killer. Clouston murdered a police detective in Buena Park, California, in 1972. He was convicted a year later. After serving 10 years in prison for the slaying, Clouston was released in 1982. In 1991, he was indicted on 17 counts of sexually abusing children in the Williamsburg, Virginia, area, according to the U.S. Marshals Service. Clouston pleaded guilty to the charges and was sent back to prison. He was paroled in 2005 but was placed on the fugitive list after he failed to register as a convicted sexual offender in Virginia. ""The capture of Paul Clouston is a testament to the effectiveness of our 15 most wanted list and the partnerships we maintain with other law enforcement agencies,"" said John F. Clark, director of the U.S. Marshals Service in a statement. ""It also speaks volumes to the value of someone doing the right thing and reporting a suspicious individual.""","Fugitive Paul Clouston, 73, taken into custody at men's group home in California .

"New York (CNN) -- In a time of voter anger at unsustainable government spending and Washington hypocrisy, here's a story that should get your blood up. Last week, the House of Representatives considered eliminating a nearly half-billion dollar earmark that was snuck into a defense authorization bill. But members of both parties voted to keep the corporate pork in the bill -- despite a supposed moratorium on earmarks and despite that the Pentagon has repeatedly said it doesn't want the money. Only in Washington would bureaucracy be force-fed a project it doesn't want or need. But so far, we haven't seen this contempt for taxpayer dollars make its way to protest signs or talk radio driven talking points. That's because President Obama opposes the earmark and the Republican congressional leadership voted for it. This doesn't fit neatly into the hyperpartisan narrative of screaming about socialism -- in which Republicans bewail overspending by Democrats -- but it's a perfect illustration of how deep the dysfunction is in Washington. At issue is the alternate engine for the Joint Strike Fighter platform, a corporate subsidized boondoggle that has cost taxpayers $1.2 billion in earmarks since 2004. It is estimated to cost at least $2.9 billion more until its completion. Defenders argue that paying GE and Rolls Royce to develop a second engine for Air Force fighters will stimulate competition in the defense industry and bring down costs in the long run while protecting jobs in the short run. Critics point out that crony capitalism can't create a true free market in the defense industry -- it's the equivalent of diet hucksters who claim you can eat yourself fitter. This is about money: pork barrel politics hiding under the noble banner of national defense. Here's how the sordid story unfolded: . An anonymous earmark was added to the defense authorization bill, requesting $485 million in new funds for the alternate engine program, despite a much-ballyhooed moratorium on earmarks going to for-profit entities (agreed to by Democrats), and a total ban on earmark requests agreed to by Republicans for fiscal year 2011. In reaction, a small bipartisan group of members of Congress -- led by Democrat Chellie Pingree of Maine and Republican Tom Rooney of Florida, joined by Democrat John Larson of Connecticut and Republican Lynn Westmoreland of Georgia -- proposed an amendment to strip the bill of the ugly anonymous earmark. Their principled stand went down to defeat by a vote of 193 to 231. It's no surprise that in a recession, the congressional representatives of Ohio and Indiana would vote to keep the earmark subsidy in the bill, including the normally stalwart fiscal conservative Mike Pence of Indiana. Those states are benefiting most from the development of the engines in terms of jobs on the ground. What's more surprising is why so many of their colleagues would climb on this pork-barrel bandwagon, including the Republican congressional leadership led by John Boehner and Eric Cantor, who are trying to build the midterm election campaign around a promise to restore fiscal discipline. That selling job that should be even tougher since a majority of Democrats voted to kill the alternate engine and a majority of Republicans voted to keep it going. ""This was the first big earmark test for 2010, and Congress failed,"" said Thomas A. Schatz, the President of Citizens Against Government Waste, which has been a steadfast critic of the alternate engine and recently released a detailed report on the subject. ""Neither party comes out looking good, but Republicans in particular missed a golden opportunity to show that they are really serious about getting government spending under control."" The next chance to stop the half-billion dollar alternate engine earmark is the Senate, when it takes up the defense authorization bill later this month. But even success there from genuine fiscal conservatives such as John McCain could be undone when the bill goes to conference -- it's the Washington way. The final stop would be a presidential veto, which President Obama has promised, under advice from Defense Secretary Gates. A half century ago, Republican President Eisenhower warned about the influence of the military-industrial complex. The former five-star general crusaded against government waste, especially in the military, because he knew that a figure with lesser credibility could be attacked as being ""soft on communism"" for proposing responsible cuts from the Pentagon budget during the Cold War. We are at war today on two fronts, even as we face down a fiscal crisis and escalating deficits and debt. We owe it to our troops to see that every dollar allocated to the military is spent where they need it, not where congressional appropriators want it. And if fiscal conservative protesters cannot marshal their energy to oppose this half-billion dollar boondoggle, then it is not just Congress' hypocrisy they should be angry at -- it is their own. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John P. Avlon.","House defeated a bid to kill a defense spending project that Pentagon says it doesn't need .

"(CNN) -- Americans are in a war that pits the politically correct against Christmas carolers, some say. They say it's a battle that plays out in the halls of Congress, retail stores and public schools across the country, and it's one that's been raging for years. Republican Rep. Henry Brown of South Carolina introduced a resolution this month asking that the House express support for the use of Christmas symbols and traditions and frown on any attempt to ban references to the holiday. ""Each year, I could see a diminishing value of the spiritual part of Christmas,"" Brown said. ""It would seem like another group would go from the Christmas spirit to the holiday spirit."" ""What I'm afraid of -- if we don't bring some kind of closure to this continuous change, then in 20 years it will almost be completely different from what we see today ... and so we would lose the whole emphasis of what the very early beginnings of Christmas was all about."" So far, the resolution has one Democrat and 72 Republicans as co-sponsors. The House hasn't taken it up, but the chamber adopted similar resolutions in the past. Barry Lynn, an ordained minister and executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, isn't keen on the prospect of congressional action. ""Resolutions like this come up because there is this bizarre view by some members of Congress that there is a war on Christmas and that they have to be the generals in some responding army,"" he said. ""My advice to the lawmakers would be promote any religion you have through your private acts, and don't try to 'help' the baby Jesus by passing a resolution on his behalf. It is arrogant and ridiculous at the same time,"" Lynn said. Christmas is in no danger of being ignored, Lynn said, noting that signs of the holiday emerge as soon as Halloween passes. ""You would literally have to be living in a very deep cave not to understand that there is a religious holiday called Christmas that is soon to come,"" he said. In his view, some people feel a ""false sense of some kind of attack on Christmas"" if a school holds a winter concert instead of a Christmas concert, or if retailers declare ""Happy Holidays"" instead of ""Merry Christmas."" Time.com: Brief history of the war on Christmas . In California, Tea Party activist Merry Hyatt is trying to get support for a ballot initiative that would require that public schools give their students an opportunity to hear Christmas songs. (Parents could opt out for their children). Lynn said the move violates the principles of church-state separation. ""It's not being anti-Christmas to recognize that most Christmas carols are really hymns, and a hymn is a prayer set to music."" Mathew Staver, law school dean at Liberty University, a Virginia college founded by the late Rev. Jerry Falwell, said, however, that some schools and businesses are going too far to ""censor"" Christmas because they don't know the laws. Staver founded the Liberty Counsel, a nonprofit litigation group dedicated to advancing religious freedom and conservative values. The counsel provides free legal advice and defense for government entities to ensure religious viewpoints on Christmas are not censored. One example Staver cited began in Oregon, where an elementary school principal replaced Christmas trees with snowmen and banned all religious symbols, saying Santa Claus fell into the category. Liberty Counsel sent the principal a letter telling her the law doesn't require her to ""secularize"" the holiday. The counsel also pointed out that by banning religious symbols for a holiday with secular components, she risked violating the Constitution by not being ""viewpoint neutral,"" Staver said. Parents were upset as well. The principal eventually changed course and restored the tree and jolly St. Nick. Staver keeps a ""Naughty & Nice"" list that shows which retailers include references to Christmas in their advertising and which do not. When he started the list five years ago, both sides were about even, but this year the ""nice"" list is longer. ""It's better this year than it was in 2005, but I think it's better this year because we and others have made a point to make sure that Christmas is not forgotten,"" he said. Peter Sprigg, a senior fellow for policy studies with the Family Research Council, which promotes Christian values, said the ""pro-Christmas side"" has made progress in recent years. In some circles, he said, ""Political correctness is preventing people from even sayings 'Merry Christmas.' "" He said it's important to defend the right of people to celebrate the holiday and noted that December 25 is a federal holiday the government recognizes as Christmas. ""If we want to be concerned about the fact that we are a multicultural nation, then the solution is to allow everyone the freedom to celebrate what they want rather than stifling the celebration of the majority because it might be offensive to the minority,"" Sprigg said. In Washington, Republicans have taken up the war on Christmas as their own battle. ""Republicans and conservatives have definitely gained a lot of political points by pointing out some of the silliest and more extreme examples of political correctness,"" said Tom Smith, director of the General Social Survey at the National Opinion Research Center. But Republicans also should worry about pushing it too far, he added, because the American people believe in ""good liberal thoughts"" like ""diversity and different people all being treated the same."" It's OK to attack political correctness, he said, but the GOP must be careful not to come off as ""anti-minority or against diversity."" The attack can backfire as well if voters think their representative is more committed to protecting Christmas than protecting jobs or economic stability, Smith said. For Staver, the campaign to save Christmas continues, and it's one he will never abandon. ""What happens this year is not necessarily an indication of what will happen next year, so I think each Christmas has to stand on its own and I think each one is worth fighting for,"" he said. ""I think we are winning a lot of the battles in the war on Christmas, but I don't think the war is done, and I don't think it ever will be.""","There's a resolution in the House to frown on attempts to ban references to Christmas .

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- A humble pigeon has just flown into a herd of pouncing cats! The white-colored bird had to spend time at an Indian police station along the country's sensitive border with Pakistan as speculation grew it could be a spy on a mission from the neighboring nation. Officers say the pigeon was captured by residents of a border town in Punjab state's Amritsar district. They found it ""peculiar"", said district police chief Gurmeet Singh Chohan. A Pakistani address stamped on its wings worried residents last week who then brought the bird to the police. ""It was kept at the police station for a day and now we have handed it over to wildlife (authorities),"" Chohan said. He denied news reports that the pigeon was ""detained"" and became subject of a probe. ""In an era of spy planes and satellites, the Amritsar (rural) police have detained a white pigeon that could have been -- the police claim -- used as a Pakistani spy,"" wrote the Hindustan Times in a page-one story Saturday. But Chohan claimed the spy theory was only ""speculation"" on the part of local residents and that authorities did not endorse it. He also accused the media of misreporting the police role in connection with the captured bird, which he insisted was just fed by the officers. The Indian Express newspaper carried a picture showing a man holding the pigeon in his palm in front of a lock-up. But Chohan downplayed the photograph as a shot staged by camera crews. Pigeon-racing is a common rural sport in the Punjab region divided between India and Pakistan, he said. Kite-flying is another common passion. ""On many occasions in the past, kites from across the border too have come in,"" Chohan said. India and Pakistan have fought three wars, two over the Himalayan territory of Kashmir, since the partition of the Asian subcontinent in 1947. Both nuclear-armed nations are in a fresh bid to mend their ties strained after the 2008 terror attack on Mumbai that India blamed on Pakistan-based militants. In April, Indian and Pakistani prime ministers met at Thimphu, Bhutan in what was seen as a thaw in the troubled relations between their countries. At a news conference in New Delhi last week, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh noted that both countries needed to build trust for better relations. ""The trust deficit is the biggest problem and unless we tackle the trust deficit, we cannot move to substantive negotiations,"" Singh remarked. ""... At Thimphu, (Pakistan) Prime Minister (Yousaf Raza) Gilani and I have agreed that trust deficit is a major problem blocking progress in the direction of moving forward...,"" he said.","Residents bring bird to police .

"Lima, Peru (CNN) -- -- A judge has extended the investigation into murder suspect Joran van der Sloot, accused of killing a Peruvian woman, for another week, a spokeswoman for Peru's Interior Ministry said Sunday. Van der Sloot, a Dutch citizen, will remain jailed at the investigations building of Peru's national police where he spent the night, Rut Cardenas said. Cardenas said a judge has given investigators another week to gather information about the killing of the woman last week. Carlos Neyra, an official with the Peruvian National Police criminal investigation division, said van der Sloot, the sole suspect named in the case, has not been formally charged. Neyra added that van der Sloot now has a lawyer. The Netherlands Embassy says it is working with local authorities in the case, but it is not paying for a defense attorney. The Embassy has told Peruvian authorities that it is not comfortable with the way van der Sloot has been presented to the media, Neyra said. The Peruvian interior minister is asking authorities not to talk about the case without his authorization. Van der Sloot arrived Saturday at the Lima police headquarters. Handcuffed and wearing a protective vest, he was escorted through a news conference held by Peruvian authorities as photographers snapped photo after photo. The body of 21-year-old Stephany Flores Ramirez was found Wednesday in a Lima hotel room registered to van der Sloot, who was twice arrested and released in connection with the 2005 disappearance of American teenager Natalee Holloway in Aruba. Peruvian authorities have released a video from May 30 where the suspect is seen entering the hotel at 5:16 a.m. local time accompanied by Flores. Moments later, he is seen entering a hotel room with Flores. More than three hours later, van der Sloot is seen exiting the hotel alone. A hotel worker is also seen in the video speaking to van der Sloot as he is leaving the hotel, Peru Interior Ministry spokesman Carlos Gonzalo said. When investigators questioned the worker, he told them that van der Sloot told him ""don't bother my girl,"" according to Gonzalo. Van der Sloot indicated to the hotel worker that he would be returning to the room, Gonzalo said. Surveillance video from a casino -- also recorded on May 30 -- shows Flores and van der Sloot playing cards at the same table, he said. The woman won about 5,000 soles (about $1,755), though it was not found in the room or the victim's car, Gonzalo said. Flores' body was badly beaten and investigators believe a tennis racquet in the room was used in the killing, Gonzalo said. He said ""they found bloodied clothes with"" van der Sloot and that investigators are testing them, as well as the tennis racquet, for DNA. The hotel workers became suspicious after no one else left the room, and eventually a foul smell came from it, Gonzalo said. It wasn't immediately clear how much time lapsed between the conversation on video and workers noticing the smell. Chilean authorities delivered van der Sloot to their Peruvian counterparts on Friday in the border town of Santa Rosa, where he was greeted by hecklers and dozens of media personnel jostling for position to get a better picture of him. Paperwork showed that van der Sloot entered Chile the same day Flores' body was found, Chilean police told CNN. He was captured in Chile on Thursday and transported to the border to be expelled, said Macarena Lopez, a spokeswoman for Interpol. Holloway was on a high school graduation trip to the Caribbean island of Aruba, where van der Sloot lived with his family, in 2005 when she disappeared.

"(CNN) -- In some ways, a catastrophe of this magnitude could not have happened in a worse place. Or at a worse time of year. We're hearing a lot about the economic dislocation of thousands of Gulf fishers and their families -- and rightly so. But the oil disaster is a much larger calamity than the Gulf itself. It's not just a regional disaster. It has hemispheric implications. The Gulf is a large region, but its natural importance is even more outsized, disproportionate to its area. The Gulf is the hourglass pinch-point for millions of migrating creatures that funnel into, breed in, migrate through and then fan out of it to populate an enormous area of the continents and coasts. Anything that affects living things inside the Gulf affects living things far outside it. Certain animals that normally inhabit the open Atlantic travel to the Gulf to breed. Two such species, both endangered, breed nowhere else. The world's most endangered sea turtle, the Kemp's ridley turtle, ranges throughout the west Atlantic as far north as New England. But it breeds only in the Gulf. Many are now heading there to lay their eggs on remote beaches. Turtles are showing up on beaches debilitated by oil. Oil kills sea turtles by both ingestion and direct toxicity, and by stressing and suppressing their immune systems. Adults are vulnerable, but hatchlings will have an even harder time. Atlantic bluefin tuna -- the most high-priced ocean fish in the world -- have declined by about 90 percent since the 1960s due to overfishing. Their west Atlantic population ranges the East Coast of the U.S. and Canada and far out to sea, but the Gulf of Mexico is the giant fish's only known breeding area. Spring is their breeding season. According to a web tool that puts the slick over your home region, the vast area of surface oil is now bigger than Massachusetts, Connecticut and Long Island combined. It overlaps the tracked movements of breeding bluefin tuna. Consequently, their eggs and larvae are presumably being bathed in a toxic soup of oil and dispersant. Dispersant, which is toxic by itself, also makes the petroleum more toxic. Instead of remaining concentrated at the surface, dispersed oil pollutes the entire water column. Instead of evaporating, the toxic components remain in the water. And because it's dissolved, it passes more easily across gills and into digestive systems. Planktonic animals become disoriented or die. Meanwhile, of course, mats of oil are washing ashore. No amount of boom will protect waterbirds like pelicans, gulls and terns, because diving into the water for fish is how they eat. In the Gulf in May, with the oil gushing, were loons, gannets, various kinds of herons and terns. Also there were black skimmers that had spent the winter there but would soon leave to migrate north and, depending on species, breed all along the coast from the southern states to as far north as the Maritimes, and lakes across much of Canada. Some of the longest-distance migrants on Earth are various sandpipers, plovers and other shorebirds, many of which winter as far south as Patagonia and breed as far north as the high arctic. Perhaps a million cross the Gulf in May, and when they reach the U.S. coastline, they must stop to rest and feed. Problems with habitat and food supply have reduced many of their populations 50 to 80 percent in the past 20 years. And now this. When oil was just starting to smudge some of the birds on beaches now thick with it, I saw sanderlings, ruddy turnstones, black-bellied plovers and other such northbound birds. Even among those that do not get heavily oiled, many will not make it. The birds' energy budgets operate on thin margins of food intake against exhaustive expenditure in long-distance flight. They will not bear the additional cost of feathers sticking and functioning inefficiently, and many such birds will drop out on their way north. Migrating peregrine falcons traveling north from South American wintering areas, destined for nesting areas as far as Greenland, are also crossing the Gulf's marshes. Preferentially picking off birds whose flight seems compromised, falcons will be getting disproportional doses of oil. All these birds can live decades and take years to mature, so adult birds killed by oil this year will mean populations reduced for years to come. This is a calamity not just in space but in time as well. Some animals may be rescued. Less possible to cleanse is the anguish on the faces and in the hearts of fishing families. Oil companies can drill, and they can buy votes in Congress, but apparently they can't do much else. Now that the reckoning is here, it becomes a little easier to see that we fool ourselves with the apparent cheapness of subsidized oil and that a healthy environment is priceless beyond reckoning. Why do we fail to know this always, in our bones? The Gulf is not a thing unto itself. Neither is the oil eruption. We are all Gulf victims now. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Carl Safina.","Gulf is huge area that is crucial for migrating species, says Carl Safina .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama returned to Louisiana Friday -- the president's second trip to the Gulf region in two weeks as the administration continued its efforts to contain the BP oil spill and stay on top of what has now become a major political issue. Among other things, Obama was scheduled to visit to Louisiana's Grand Isle and meet with local business leaders directly impacted by the spill.  Shortly after arriving, he huddled with U.S. Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen -- the federal government's response manager -- and both state and local elected officials. Included in the list of officials meeting the president: Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, Alabama Gov. Bob Reilly, Florida Gov. Charlie Crist, Louisiana Sen. David Vitter and New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu. Obama's latest visit came as BP finally started to siphon oil from the ruptured undersea well.  BP is currently preparing to shut four vents on top of a containment cap from which oil has been escaping into the ocean. Closing the vents would greatly reduce the amount of oozing crude. No one, however, can say with certainty whether BP's latest effort to contain and recover the oil will succeed. Obama refused to provide details about attempts to seal off the well, but said ""it does appear that the cap at least for now is holding.""  He quickly added, however, that it's ""way too early to be optimistic.""   Officials should know more about the success or failure of the effort in next 24 to 48 hours, he said. ""I'm long out of the prediction business on this,"" White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs told reporters on Air Force One en route to Louisiana. ""Everyone is hopeful that this works."" The president later stressed BP's ""moral and legal obligations"" to the Gulf region, promising that federal officials will be watching BP to ensure the company isn't ""lawyering up."" Obama noted that BP is spending millions of dollars on television ads designed to improve the company's image, as well as distributing billions in sharehold dividends.  I do not want BP ""nickel and diming folks"" in the Gulf, he said. Obama, who previously said he is ""furious at (the) entire situation,"" has been criticized by some political observers for failing to show enough empathy and emotional involvement in the response to the spill.  Fifty-one percent of adult Americans disapproved of Obama's handling of the spill in a May 21-23 CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll, while 46 percent approved. Obama told CNN's Larry King Thursday that ""I'd love to spend my time venting and yelling at people (about the situation in the Gulf), but that's not the job I was hired to do.  My job is to solve this problem."" Democratic strategist James Carville told CNN Friday he doesn't worry that Obama ""doesn't emote that well or something like that.""  But the president, he said, ""is a man of formidable intelligence.  He has a ton of power, and I think what we want to do is feel that power ... and let people feel the wrath (and know) that he's standing up"" for them. Crist expressed some sympathy for Obama. Crist acknowledged Friday the situation in the Gulf is ""emotional,"" but asserted that the president is ""trying to do the best job he can."" ""You've got to keep a cool head in order to win a hot game,"" he said.  ""You've got to keep your wits about you to lead with honor."" Daily Beast political columnist John Avlon said Friday that while part of Obama's ""narrative"" is that ""he's cool,"" the president needs to show he's ""feeling the pain of the problem on the ground.  We're a quick fix culture (and) we have a vivid problem unfolding in the Gulf.  That's starting to affect (the) perception of this administration in the larger sense."" The BP well erupted after an explosion and fire on the leased Deepwater Horizon drilling rig on April 20 that killed 11 people.  The rig sank two days later, leaving up to 19,000 barrels (798,000 gallons) of oil pouring into the Gulf daily, according to federal estimates.  BP, rig owner Transocean and oilfield services contractor Halliburton have all pointed fingers at each other for the disaster.","NEW: Obama says officials should have a good idea in 24-48 hours if efforts to stop the leak are succeeding .

"TOKYO, Japan (CNN)  -- Yoshiko Sato would love to give her only son a brother or a sister. But money struggles and Japan's cost of living have pushed the mother to wait. Japanese mother Yoshiko Sato says the proposal ""would help us with a second child."" A proposal to pay parents about $3,400 a year per child has got her thinking seriously about expanding her family. The cash for kids plan is the brainchild of the country's new ruling Democratic Party of Japan, which came into power during the elections this week. The proposal has garnered supporters and critics. ""It would help us with a second child,"" Sato said. The proposal would pay families the money every year until the child reached high school. It is an effort to boost Japan's birthrate, which is one of the lowest in the world and is a major drag on the country's economy. It is compounded by Japan's rapidly aging population. About a quarter of the country's population is older than 65, according to government figures. By 2050, that number is expected to reach 40 percent.  Watch as some parents ponder procreation » . Nevertheless, the money for babies proposal has its critics. Economist Yuri Okina said she wonders where Japan's government is going to come up with the money to fund it. The plan is not an instant fix, she said. What's needed, Okina said, is a way for women to remain in the work force after having children instead of being forced out because of lack of child care. ""We have to make it normal in Japan for a woman to raise a child and have a career,"" Okina said. Critics also have said the plan would not fix a significant problem for working families -- the lack of day care centers. About 40,000 children are on waiting lists for day care, according to government figures. These facilities' scarcity is problematic for mothers such as Hiromi Espineli. ""Going back to work would be tough,"" she said, ""since there are so few day care centers.""","New ruling party proposes to pay parents about $3,400 a year per child .

"(CNN) -- Chalk another record to the United Arab Emirates' collection. The Capital Gate building in the desert kingdom's capital, Abu Dhabi, has been certified by Guinness World Records as the ""World's Furthest Leaning Man-made Tower."" How far does it lean? Nearly five times farther than the Leaning Tower of Pisa in Italy. The 35-story Abu Dhabi building has an 18-degree slope, compared with four degrees for the freestanding bell tower. But unlike the tower in Pisa, the Capital Gate building has been deliberately engineered to slant. The floor plates are stacked vertically up to the 12th floor, after which they are staggered over each other by between 300 mm to 1,400 mm -- giving the tower its lean, the owners said. ""It is a signature building which speaks to the foresight of the emirate,"" said Sheikh Sultan Bin Tahnoon al Nahyan, the chairman of the building's owner, Abu Dhabi National Exhibitions Company. The mixed-use building will be ready for occupancy at the end of the year. It is featured in a new National Geographic documentary, called ""Megastructures.""

"(CNN) -- The latest prediction for the 2009 Atlantic hurricane season agrees with three previous ones, forecasting a season that will be at least a bit milder than last year's. Last year's most destructive hurricane, Ike, tossed boats onto the shore in Bayton, Texas, in September. AccuWeather is the most recent organization to release its outlook, predicting Wednesday that the season, which runs from June 1 to November 30, will bring 13 named storms and eight hurricanes. In 2008, there were 16 named storms and eight hurricanes, five of which were major -- that is, classified as Category 3 on the Saffir-Simpson scale of storm intensity -- with winds of 111 mph or higher. The three previous forecasts were released in December by Colorado State University (14 named storms, seven hurricanes), WSI Corp. (13 named storms, seven hurricanes) and Weather Research Center (seven named storms, four hurricanes). Storms acquire a name when they are designated tropical storms, with sustained maximum winds of at least 39 mph. Though they foresee fewer storms than last year, all the forecasts except the one from the Weather Research Center would translate into an above-average season. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a ""normal"" Atlantic season has 11 named storms, six hurricanes and two major hurricanes. NOAA won't release its predictions until closer to the start of the season. And the forecasts already made are likely to be updated as June draws near. AccuWeather projected that four of the hurricanes in 2009 will hit the U.S. East Coast or Gulf Coast, and one of those will be a Category 3. Joe Bastardi, AccuWeather's chief long-range forecaster, wrote on the company's Web site that this year's ""storms may be more likely to form in the Atlantic Basin closer to the coast, and the possibility of a major hurricane making landfall in the U.S. cannot be ruled out."" WSI, on its Web site, said its predictions for 2009 stemmed from the expected continuation of ""warmer-than-normal Atlantic Ocean temperature anomalies into next summer and fall, and the likelihood of a favorable or neutral wind shear environment associated with the lack of an El Niño event."" El Niño is a fluctuation in the ocean-atmosphere system in the tropical Pacific that can impact global weather. Last year was considered the fourth busiest Atlantic hurricane year since 1944. The National Climatic Data Center said 2008 was ""the only year on record in which a major hurricane existed in every month from July through November in the north Atlantic."" The most destructive was Hurricane Ike, which wiped out neighborhoods in parts of Texas. Even a week later, its remnants were still having an impact on the Great Lakes region. Two other hurricanes made landfall in the United States last year -- Dolly and Gustav. Neither was a major hurricane at the time it came ashore.","AccuWeather forecast joins three others predicting milder hurricane season .

"Washington (CNN) -- Calling him one of America's ""most experienced and most respected intelligence professionals,"" President Barack Obama has nominated Air Force Lt. Gen. James Clapper to be the new director of national intelligence. ""He possesses a quality that I value in all my advisers, a willingness to tell leaders what we need to know, even if it's not what we want to hear,"" said Obama. He made the announcement in the Rose Garden with Clapper on Saturday. Clapper, who retired from the Air Force in 1995 after a 32-year career, served as head of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency from September 2001 to June 2006. Clapper, now a top Pentagon intelligence official, would replace Dennis Blair, who resigned at the end of last month. Obama said he'll be looking for Clapper ""to ensure that we have the most capable and efficient intelligence community possible."" If confirmed, Clapper will become the nation's fourth DNI in the last five years. The position was created after the September 2001 terrorist attacks to oversee the 16 agencies of the U.S. intelligence community. Obama said he's indicated to other Senate leaders that the confirmation should be carried out ""swiftly."" ""The Senate has voted to confirm Jim for senior positions on four separate occasions, and each time it has done so overwhelmingly,"" he said. ""This nomination can't fall victim to the usual Washington politics."" Some political observers have indicated that Clapper's prospects for confirmation on Capitol Hill, however, are questionable. Intelligence Committee Chair Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, recently said the ""best thing for the U.S. intelligence community is to have someone with a civilian background in charge."" Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Kit Bond, R-Missouri, said he has reservations about Clapper. ""I believe he is too focused on the Defense Department issues and he has tried to block out efforts to give more authority to the DNI,"" Bond argued. Bond's counterpart on the House side, Rep. Pete Hoekstra, R-Michigan, also said he believes Clapper is the wrong person, because he is ""not forthcoming, open or transparent"" with Congress. But Obama said: ""Jim also understands the importance of working with our partners in Congress. As he has said, not merely to appear when summoned, to keep Congress informed and seek members' consent."" Blair, a retired admiral, was pressured to resign as DNI because of differences with the White House over the scope of his role and turf wars with CIA Director Leon Panetta and other members of the intelligence community. One source familiar with Blair's situation said that from the very beginning, ""the White House did not have the same view (as Blair) of what the DNI should be."" Panetta, in a statement Saturday, said, ""Few people have more intelligence experience than Jim Clapper. The men and women of the CIA look forward to working closely with him in his new role to strengthen America's national security.""

"(CNN) -- Valentino Rossi's hopes of retaining his MotoGP title were shattered on Saturday when the nine-time world champion motorcyclist suffered a horrific crash in a practice session for his home race in Italy. The 31-year-old could be out for months after fracturing a shin bone in his leg when he was thrown from his Yamaha in the second session ahead of qualifying at Mugello. He had an operation on Saturday afternoon, the official MotoGP Web site reported, after being flown to Careggi Hospital in Florence and then moved to the orthopedic trauma center. ""It's an injury more serious than we thought, because it's an exposed fracture with the bone protruding from the skin,"" Doctor Claudio Macchiagodena of the sport's traveling medics Clinica Mobile told motogp.com. ""We have reduced the fracture, which fortunately has not affected any blood vessels or nerves. It is serious."" Doctor Roberto Buzzi, who performed the operation, said Rossi would be ruled out for at least two months. The rider, known as ""The Doctor"" among other nicknames, could miss eight races, starting with Sunday's Italian Grand Prix -- which he has won nine times. ""The surgery had good results,"" Buzzi told motogp.com. ""The alignment was good and the bone is now stable. ""The wound remains open, as is usual in these cases, and it will be stitched in the next few days with another short surgery. We are confident that Valentino will be able to leave the hospital in a week to 10 days, able to put weight on the leg with the aid of crutches. ""It is difficult to say how long the post surgery rehabilitation will take. But I think that we can reasonably think of six weeks of partial weight-bearing with crutches, after which Valentino needs to be re-evaluated."" Rossi has not missed a race since his debut in the 125cc class in Malaysia in 1996, but his record run of 230 successive GP starts will now end. He is second overall in the world championship standings this season, nine points behind Jorge Lorenzo of Spain, who will start Sunday's race second on the grid behind compatriot Dani Pedrosa. Australia's former world champion Casey Stoner qualified third ahead of Ducati teammate Nicky Hayden, whose veteran fellow American Colin Edwards was fifth on a Monster Yamaha Tech 3. Pedrosa is fourth overall, 30 points behind Lorenzo, as he seeks his first win of 2010. Lorenzo is seeking his third successive victory in what is the fourth race of the season. ""I want to say how sad I am for Valentino. I know how bad it is to be injured, especially at your home race, and it looks very painful for him,"" the 23 year-old told motogp.com.

"(CNN) -- As many as 200 foreign fighters affiliated with al Qaeda may now be hiding in southern Somalia, according to the latest assessments by the U.S. military and intelligence community. Two U.S. military officials confirmed the estimate to CNN, emphasizing it is only an estimate because of the lack of direct intelligence information from the ground. It comes as a senior U.S. official separately confirmed to CNN that updated plans have been put into place for U.S. special operations forces to conduct operations against al Qaeda personnel in Somalia, if targets can be identified and located. All three officials declined to be identified because the information involves intelligence matters. The United States believes the foreign fighters include Afghans, Iraqis, Pakistanis, Saudis, and Yemenis as well as nationals from several African countries, the officials said. It is believed many of these fighters have been part of the longstanding pipeline of fighters that operated in Afghanistan and Iraq and has now been diverted to Somalia, they said. The estimate of 200 fighters does not include an unknown number of ethnic Somalis who are believed to have traveled to Somalia from Europe, the United States and other African countries, they said. In assessing the threat posed by the presence of foreign fighters, one of the U.S. military officials said the most dangerous are perhaps as many as two dozen ""subject matter experts"" from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia who are teaching bomb-making and other small arms tactics in camps across southern Somalia. The balance of the foreign fighters is believed to be operating with the Al-Shabaab organization, an al Qaeda affiliate group in Somalia that is fighting the government and African Union peacekeepers in an effort to take control of the country. One official said Somalia is now ""the ultimate safe haven."" The official added that the United States must operate on the assumption that the core group of foreign fighters are training others to conduct attacks against western targets in East Africa, as well as training individuals to attack targets in the United States. ""They have goals beyond the Somalia border,"" one official said. The United States has observed a number of ad hoc training camps in southern Somalia, the officials said. Generally, they operate for no more than three months before fighters move to other locations because they know they are likely to be observed by U.S. intelligence satellites or reconnaissance drones flying overhead, officials said. Fighters are using existing areas like old army camps, buildings, and even cemeteries to disguise the real purpose of their activities, the officials said. The top al Qaeda operative still being sought in Somalia is Fazul Abdullah Mohammed, long wanted for his alleged role in the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. He is believed to be moving between the remote border regions of Somalia and Kenya, the officials said. In September 2009, U.S. commandos killed Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan in a helicopter attack on his vehicle convoy after hunting him for years. Nabhan was seen as perhaps a key leader of al Qaeda operations in East Africa and, according to U.S. officials, it is not clear who, if anyone, has taken his place.","U.S. officials say as many as 200 foreign fighters may be in Somalia .

"(CNN) -- Perez Hilton is a celebrity blogger who dishes out the latest Hollywood gossip, but there's something about his personal life you may not know. Latino gays say they face a double dose of discrimination. Hilton is a Latino pioneer. He is one of the first Latino public figures in the U.S. to be openly gay. While Latinos have broken ground on the U.S. Supreme Court, in Hollywood and in professional sports, gay Latinos in the nation's public arena remain largely invisible. Hilton says deep-seated homophobia within the Latino community has forced many gay Latinos to go underground, but attitudes are shifting. ""At the beginning, when I came out to my mom, she reacted with a sigh and said, 'You're my son and I have to love you,' "" Hilton says. ""But now she says, 'You're the best son in the world, and we need to find you a man.' "" Some gay Latino leaders are starting to share Hilton's optimism. The Latino community has long had a reputation for being notoriously homophobic. But some surprising developments within the Latino world -- in the United States and abroad -- suggest that may be changing, gay scholars and activists say. 'Walls are starting to crumble' ""A lot of walls are starting to crumble,"" says Charlie Vazquez, a New York-based author whose fiction has appeared in books such as ""Best Gay Love Stories: NYC."" ""We're at a crossroads,"" he says. ""A new generation of better-educated Latinos is coming of age."" Gay Latino activists point to several signs of this transformation: . El Diario La Prensa, one of the oldest and largest Spanish-language newspapers in the U.S., recently endorsed the rights of same-sex couples to marry. Within the past three years, lawmakers in countries as diverse as Uruguay, Colombia and Mexico have passed laws granting rights and protections to gays and lesbians. Christian Chavez, lead singer of the popular pop Mexican band RBD, recently announced that he was gay. ""He wasn't rejected by any of his band mates or fans,"" Hilton says of Chavez. ""That's a huge step for gay visibility in the Latino media world."" And far away from the stage, even some of the most vulnerable gay Latinos -- ordinary students in public high schools -- are finding more support, one group says. While many gay Latino students still face physical and verbal harassment from classmates and teachers, more are becoming bolder about affirming their sexual identity, a recent survey found. A 2007 survey conducted by the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network discovered that at schools where a Gay Student Alliance club existed, 59 percent of gay Latino students participated in the club, says Elizabeth Diaz, a senior researcher at the network. The survey defined gay youths as those who were lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. The network also says that since 1999, at least 4,000 Gay Student Alliances have formed groups at public and private schools in the United States. ""While harassment in schools for Latino gay students remained high, we also know that these students have more support than in past generations,"" Diaz says. At least one Latina scholar is now even questioning a fundamental assumption about homophobia in the Latino community. Lourdes Torres, president of Amigas Latinas, a lesbian and bisexual support group, says the notion that Latino people are more homophobic and its men more macho is not only false, but tinged with racism. Men from all sorts of ethnic groups have long acted in a patriarchal manner, but only Latino men have the term ""machismo"" attached to their behavior, she says. ""People tend to think that somehow, we're more repressed and living in the Dark Ages,"" says Torres, a professor at DePaul University in Chicago, Illinois. ""They forget that just as things are changing in the U.S., they're also changing in Latin America,"" she says. The walls that still stand . Yet Torres and others also say that being gay and Latino presents special challenges. Like other gay people of color, Latino gays face a double bind: discrimination from mainstream culture and from their own community, Torres says. This double bind presents an obstacle to Latinos who consider coming out, Torres says. Their challenge: risking rejection from their family when they need their family as a refuge from racism, she says. ""The family is the unit that provides the support and the one place that people can feel free and protected,"" Torres says. ""It becomes doubly difficult for people to come out."" Those who take that risk may pay a price. Emanuel Xavier, a gay poet and spoken word artist, says he almost destroyed himself because he couldn't find acceptance within the Latino community. The New York-based poet says he grew up knowing that his sexual identity infuriated other Latinos. He once saw kids pelt a gay Latino hairdresser with stones. He routinely heard Roman Catholic priests condemn homosexuals. His own mother called him names when she discovered he was gay, says Xavier, editor of ""Mariposas: A Modern Anthology of Queer Latino Poetry."" Xavier says he was so filled with self-loathing that he once sold drugs and engaged in risky sexual behavior. ""I became all those things society expected me to become,"" he says. ""I thought that was the only thing I could be."" Xavier says he decided to ditch his reckless lifestyle and become a poet. He reconciled with his mother and took on a new mission. He wanted to show others that one could be Latino, gay and proud. ""Fortunately, I walked away unscathed,"" he says of his earlier days. ""I thought that God had given me a second chance, and I felt like I had to do something with that."" Gay Latinos like Xavier who decide to become activists, though, may run into an unexpected problem. How do you organize a community that is so fragmented? People often talk about the Latino community in the U.S. as if it is one community. Yet Latino leaders often point out that there is not one Latino community in the U.S., but many. A U.S. citizen from Guatemala, for example, may not appreciate being called a Mexican. Politics, food, history -- they all differ among various Latino groups in the U.S. Andres Duque, a gay Latino activist and journalist, says those differences  can make it difficult to mobilize support for Latino gay issues. ""It's difficult to get united around a single issue,"" says Duque, whose blogging name is ""Blabbeando."" ""When people are trying to form a Latino voice, it's difficult because you have different cultures with different visions and goals,"" Duque says. For now, Hilton, the Hollywood blogger, may seem like a coalition of one -- a Latino public figure who is proud of being gay. But he says he doesn't feel isolated. ""I really don't think I'm alone,"" he says. ""I don't feel alone."" He says that gay Latinos who decide to stop living undercover will become more commonplace in the future. ""It's tough -- I'm not saying it's not there,"" Hilton says of homophobia in the Latino community. ""But as time goes on, it will change.""","Hollywood blogger Perez Hilton talks about coming out .

However, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said in its cancellation alert it was only advising governments, and ""only national and local government agencies have the authority to make decisions regarding the official state of alert in their area and any actions to be taken in response."" Despite the cancellation, Japan remained cautious. The nation's meteorological agency opted to downgrade the warning without eliminating it entirely. Its prior alert of ""major tsunami"" was changed to ""tsunami."" The quake struck Chile early Saturday, killing at least 300 people and prompting tsunami warnings and advisories along the Pacific. Chilean officials are expected to announce an updated death toll later Sunday. Full coverage of Chile quake . Japan experienced waves along its coast Sunday afternoon. It was the last nation a tsunami was expected to reach, according to the alert. No injuries were reported, but Japanese authorities advised tens of thousands of evacuees from coastal areas not to return home yet. The first tsunami -- a 4-inch wave -- hit the Pacific island of Minami Torishima, according to the Japanese meteorological agency. A few waves later, the tallest one yet at about 4 feet hit the Kuji Port in Iwate, the meteorological agency said. The northern part of the main island could be hit by a tsunami at least 9 feet high. Are you there? Share your photos, video with CNN . Sunday's alert was Japan's first major tsunami warning in more than 15 years, the agency reported. In 1960, a tsunami spawned by Chile's 1960 earthquake killed 140 people in Japan. In the U.S. state of Hawaii, the cancellation occurred nearly two hours after the first waves came ashore. Coast Guard crews said they had found no significant damage to ports or waterways as a result of the tsunami. But the tsunami center said some coastal areas may see small sea-level changes or unusual currents for the next few hours. The cancellation ""does not mean it is now safe to resume normal activities or re-enter evacuated shoreline areas,"" the tsunami center said. It said that county civil defense agencies and local police departments would make those determinations. ""There was no assessment of any damage in any county, which is quite remarkable,"" said Gov. Linda Lingle. ""It's just a wonderful day that nothing happened and no one was hurt or injured."" Check out the world's biggest earthquakes since 1900 . In Chile, tsunami waves came ashore along the coast shortly after the earthquake, U.S. Geological Survey geophysicist Victor Sardina said. The largest was 9 feet near the quake's epicenter, Sardina said. On the island of Juan Fernandez -- 400 miles (643 km) off Chile's coast -- a large wave killed six people, Provincial Governor Ivan De La Maza said. At least 11 people are missing. Navigational buoys in Ventura County, California, got minor damage as a result of a 2-foot surge and waves, according to the Alaska Tsunami Warning Center.

"(CNN) -- Gov. David Paterson had no intention of appointing Caroline Kennedy to fill the Senate seat vacated by Hillary Clinton, a source close to the New York governor told CNN Thursday. Caroline Kennedy has withdrawn her name from consideration for Hillary Clinton's Senate seat. The source told CNN that Paterson did not think Kennedy was ""ready for prime time,"" citing her efforts, at times awkward, to try to win the appointment. ""She clearly has no policy experience and couldn't handle the pressure,"" said the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation. ""Why would he pick her given how badly she handled herself in recent weeks?"" Kennedy, 51, cited personal reasons for her decision not to continue pursuing the Senate seat. She informed the media at midnight, as Wednesday turned to Thursday. Paterson is charged with naming a replacement for Clinton, who resigned her seat to become the secretary of state in President Obama's administration. Paterson will appoint someone to hold the seat until a new election is held in 2010. A Kennedy ally, though, denied Kennedy had any indication Paterson was leaning against choosing her to fill out Clinton's term. And another Kennedy confidante said Kennedy allies are getting frustrated about what they perceive as the governor's insiders slighting her. Paterson, who is expected to name his choice Friday, has been coy about who he will pick to replace Clinton. Kennedy had been very public in expressing her interest in the seat by meeting with state and community leaders throughout the state. Her uncle, Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Massachusetts, was rushed to the hospital on Tuesday following Obama's swearing-in ceremony. But an aide to Caroline Kennedy indicated Sen. Kennedy's health was not the reason she decided to withdraw. By early Thursday afternoon, there was still confusion over how and why Kennedy withdrew her name from consideration. The source close to the governor told CNN that Kennedy initially called Paterson in the afternoon to tell him that ""she was feeling unsure about her candidacy"" and ""asked him for 24 hours to think about it."" A Kennedy aide said that during the call with the governor, it was Paterson who told her to take more time to think about her decision. Later Wednesday evening, the governor started getting phone calls from the media saying they heard she had withdrawn. At around 11 p.m. ET, the source close to the governor said Kennedy called Paterson and ""said she was issuing a statement saying she was in the race."" One hour later, the source said Kennedy issued a statement withdrawing from the race. Paterson's office finally addressed the matter late Thursday afternoon in a prepared statement. ""Last night Caroline Kennedy informed the governor that she was withdrawing her name from consideration for an appointment to the United States Senate for personal reasons,"" Paterson's office said. ""This decision was hers alone."" Paterson's office acknowledged the Wednesday afternoon conversation between the governor and Kennedy, but did not divulge what was said. ""Out of respect for her decision making process, the governor's Office did not respond to any inquiries in order to allow her time to deliberate,"" Paterson's office said in the statement. ""The governor considers Caroline a friend and knows she will continue to serve New York well inside or outside of government. We wish her well in all her future endeavors."" Paterson's office also noted that he is ""now entering the final phase of his selection process."" Kennedy was widely considered the front-runner to replace Clinton, who won the New York Senate seat in 2000, and almost all of the buzz about a replacement centered around her. But as the weeks dragged on, polling showed her popularity among New Yorkers dwindling. A poll earlier this month suggested New Yorkers preferred Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, son of former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, to Kennedy, with 31 percent of respondents favoring Cuomo and 24 percent preferring Kennedy. However, ""celebrity magazines and cocktail party chatter don't build support for senators,"" Democratic national committeeman and CNN contributor Robert Zimmerman said Thursday. Zimmerman was one of the first New York Democrats to say Kennedy wouldn't get the Senate seat and that Paterson wouldn't bow to pressure. Her handlers ""didn't demonstrate they had a real plan of action,"" he said Thursday. ""The disorganized way she dropped out was reflective of the very disorganized campaign she pursued in seeking the Senate seat,"" he added. New York Reps. Carolyn Maloney, Kirsten Gillibrand and Steve Israel have also been mentioned as possible replacements for Clinton. All three drew single-digit support in the January poll. Paterson's office also said the governor had not obtained any information during the selection process that might prompt a candidate to withdraw. There has been much speculation as to why Kennedy, a member of Obama's vice presidential search committee, withdrew her name. Despite the governor's public statement, a source close to Paterson told CNN that Kennedy did have potentially embarrassing issues including problems with her taxes and with her nanny. People who move in New York political circles were buzzing Thursday about the endless finger pointing between people loyal to Paterson and those loyal to Kennedy. Contacted by CNN to address the allegations of problems with taxes and a nanny, Kennedy's spokesman Stefan Friedman said in a prepared statement: ""Caroline Kennedy withdrew her name for consideration from the United States Senate for personal reasons. Any statements to the contrary are false. The governor set up a fair and deliberative selection process. This kind of mudslinging demeans that process and all those involved.""","NEW: Source says Gov. Paterson did not think Kennedy was ""ready for prime time""

"(CNN) -- Funeral plans for Gary Coleman are ""pending"" more than a week after his death, but his parents have dropped their bid to have the actor's body returned to Chicago for burial, the man named as executor of his estate said Saturday. Coleman's ex-wife Shannon Price had previously announced a weekend service for Coleman, who died over a week ago after a fall at his Utah home. Price ""has absolutely no rights or authority, with regard to the disposition of Gary's remains, services, estate management,"" said Dion Mial, Coleman longtime friend and former manager. ""Plans for any services are pending, at this time,"" Mial said. Coleman's will, which has been reviewed by his parents and their lawyer, named Mial to oversee his estate, Mial and a spokesman for his parents said. ""I am humbled by Gary's confidence in me and by his fearless friendship,"" Mial said in a statement sent to CNN Saturday. ""My life is transformed, because of his distinct presence in it."" Sue and Willie Coleman made the decision to drop their efforts after reviewing copies of Coleman's will and other trust documents provided by attorneys in Utah, where Coleman lived with his former wife, Shannon Price, until his death last week. ""From the start, Mr. and Mrs. Coleman's intention has been to see that Gary's wishes be honored and that his affairs be taken care of properly,"" attorney Frederick Jackson said in a statement. ""They wanted to do things the right way, and they urge those still involved to do the same. The Colemans ask that everyone please treat Gary with respect and kindness. They feel it is time for him to find peace and let his spirit go."" Coleman's relationship with his parents was strained since he successfully sued them 20 years ago for $1 million, claiming they squandered his earnings as a child actor. Mial became Coleman's manager when he fired his parents. Mial was a close companion of Coleman when he was a child actor on ""Diff'rent Strokes."" ""Not only am I saying goodbye to a friend, but I'm saying goodbye to my brother,"" Mial said. ""I will not allow my selfish grief to eclipse the unspeakable joy that Gary brought to me and to my family for the last 32 years. I'm as equally and passionately committed to honor his memory, as I was always so committed to his destiny in life."" The body of the 42-year-old actor, who died last Friday of a brain hemorrhage in a Provo, Utah, hospital, is now at Lake Hill Mortuary in Sandy, Utah. The legal department at the mortuary's parent company -- Memorial Mortuaries -- told CNN it has control of Coleman's remains until legal documents are presented showing who has authority over them. Coleman and Price divorced in 2008, but they were living together in Santaquin, Utah, when he suffered the fall, which proved fatal. Price, 24, had the legal authority to authorize his doctor to disconnect his life support, the Utah Valley Regional Medical Center in Provo said. ""Mr. Coleman had completed an Advanced Health Care Directive that granted Shannon Price permission to make medical decisions on his behalf if he was unable to do so,"" said the hospital statement, which Price authorized. The document was in effect when the decision to remove Coleman from life support was made last Friday, the hospital said. ""An Advanced Health Care Directive remains in effect regardless of a patient's marital status, unless modified by the patient,"" the hospital statement said. Coleman suffered a brain hemorrhage after he fell at his home on Wednesday, May 26. He died two days later, after he was removed from life support, a hospital spokeswoman said. While he appeared ""lucid and conscious"" Thursday morning, his condition worsened by the afternoon, leaving him unconscious and on life support, she said. Coleman is best known as the wisecracking youngster Arnold on TV's ""Diff'rent Strokes"" from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s. ""There was a touch of magic and a different stroke in Gary Coleman,"" said TV legend Norman Lear, who produced the show. ""He was the inspiration behind his show's title.""

"Venice, Louisiana (CNN) -- On day 46 of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, BP began to siphon oil from the ruptured undersea well to the surface, where it was flowing onto the awaiting drill ship Discover Enterprise. As the recovery process started Friday, BP said it would shut four vents on top of a containment cap from which oil was still escaping into the ocean. The company hoped that closing the vents would greatly reduce the amount of gushing crude, though there was still enormous uncertainty about the ultimate success of BP's latest effort to contain and recover the oil. U.S. Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen, the federal government's response manager, said estimates of how much oil is being captured or whether any leaks develop will be determined later Friday. President Obama, who said he was ""furious at this entire situation,"" arrived in Louisiana on Friday afternoon to get another firsthand look at the environmental damage and speak with political and business leaders. Obama did not provide details about attempts to seal the well, but said ""it does appear that the cap -- at least for now -- is holding."" He quickly added, however, that it is ""way too early to be optimistic."" Officials should know more about the success or failure of the effort in next 24 to 48 hours, he said. Researchers at the University of South Florida have completed laboratory tests confirming that the oil gushing into the Gulf of Mexico has collected into more than one oil plume beneath the surface. The plumes are as wide as 6 miles, though their lengths are unclear, researchers said. In the past, BP has denied that such large amounts of oil, which can choke fish and harm their eggs, have formed into underwater plumes. However, on Tuesday, BP Managing Director Bob Dudley said, ""The science of the plumes hanging in the water doesn't feel right. What happens is dispersant breaks the drops down into small drops and they move around and break down."" Last month, Dudley told NPR that the plumes likely would not remain. ""Oil by nature, in its own specific gravity, isn't going to stay in a plume like that,"" he said. ""It should rise to the surface, and then we'll be able to attack the spill in that way."" The university, which recently discovered a second oil plume in the Gulf, concluded that microscopic oil droplets are forming deepwater oil plumes. ""These hydrocarbons are from depth and not associated with sinking, degraded oil, but associated with the source of the Deep Horizon well head,"" said David Hollander, a professor of chemical oceanography at USF. On Thursday, Allen acknowledged ""some anecdotal reports from research vessels from universities that have found dense plumes or what they believe to be plumes under the water."" ""We're in the process of taking samples and trying to figure out what they are,"" he said. ""They're denser than the water, but we're not sure whether it's oil or not."" The cost of the federal response effort to the spill totaled $93 million as of June 1, according to a Friday letter from Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano and Allen to congressional leadership. They are requesting Congress approve a proposed provision that would make available up to an additional $100 million to the Coast Guard. The Obama administration has also sent a $69 million bill to BP for the government's efforts to help deal with the spill. The bill accounts for 75 percent of what BP owes to date, and the company has until July 1 to pay the full amount, an administration official said. Oil that has already affected Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama is drifting steadily toward Florida. A new trajectory from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued Friday forecast oil onshore as far east as Destin, Florida, by Saturday afternoon. Tar balls, tar patties and sheen were confirmed 10 miles from the Escambia County shoreline, and the primary oil plume, according to NOAA, was 30 miles from Pensacola, Florida. Escambia County Commission Chairman Grover Robinson, whose district covers Pensacola, said he found tar balls the size of silver dollars and smaller while walking on the beach Friday morning. He added that BP didn't send cleanup crews until hours later in the afternoon. However, he said there was nothing unusual about the water, and that the beach remained open to tourists. ""You can't help but be passionate about Florida,"" Gov. Charlie Crist said Friday about the state's natural beauty and the importance of tourism. What was needed now, he said, was strong leadership to get through the crisis. ""You've got to keep a cool head in order to win a hot game,"" he said. BP remained optimistic but again warned that the containment cap had been positioned on a ruptured well head a mile below the ocean's surface. In a statement, the British oil giant said that the system's ability to contain oil or its continued operation ""cannot be assured."" On Thursday night, BP completed a complex underwater maneuver. After mixed success with cutting off a damaged pipe, BP positioned a cap over the ruptured well head, though the company was uncertain whether the cap's seal would be snug enough to prevent oil from leaking out. Even so, Doug Suttles, BP's chief operating officer, was hopeful. ""I think it should work,"" he said. Undersea images Friday showed a great deal of oil still spewing from the well. Allen said the vents in the cap were designed to let oil escape to prevent cold water from entering and forming icy hydrates that could block the flow to the surface. Only when the vents are closed will BP be able to determine whether the seal on the cap is snug enough to keep massive amounts of oil from gushing into the ocean. BP's progress was received with tempered applause. ""The placement of the containment cap is another positive development in BP's most recent attempt to contain the leak. However, it will be some time before we can confirm that this method will work,"" said Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Tony Russell. ""Even if successful, this is only a temporary and partial fix, and we must continue our aggressive response."" The well may not be completely sealed off until at least until August, when BP hopes to finish drilling two relief wells. ""Our task is to contain the oil, ultimately to eliminate the leaking well and, most importantly, to clean up the oil, defend the shoreline and restore the shoreline where the oil comes ashore, so we return it to the original state,"" said Tony Hayward, BP's chief executive officer. Hayward appears this week in television ads launched as part of a national campaign to restore the British oil company's tarnished reputation. In them, Hayward apologizes and promises to ""make this right."" However, state and local leaders said they are fed up with the way BP has approached the response. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said he told Obama Friday that ""BP still hasn't given the state a dime"" to pay for its efforts in cleanup. ""We are moving forward with or without BP."" He also blasted the company for not quickly compensating those who are out of work because of the spill. ""Our people deserve to be fully compensated for their losses,"" Jindal said. ""Instead of BP shelling out $50 million on an ad campaign that promises to do good work in responding to this spill, BP should just focus on actually doing a good job and spend the $50 million on assistance to our people, our industries and our communities that are suffering as a result of this ongoing spill."" A BP spokesman wouldn't put a price on the ad campaign, but said ""not a cent is being diverted from the oil spill response."" Protests against the oil company that sprouted this week are set to continue in several cities through the weekend. And anger continued to fester in coastal communities. Hayward said Friday that the company will establish a separate division to manage its response to the crisis. BP has said that it has spent $1 billion so far but that it was too early to predict the ultimate financial blow. ""We've got considerable firepower to deal with the costs,"" said Chief Financial Officer Byron Grote, referring to $5 billion in available cash, $5 billion in bank credit lines and an additional $5 billion in standby credit facilities. The BP well erupted after an explosion and fire on the leased Deepwater Horizon drilling rig on April 20 that killed 11 people. The rig sank two days later, leaving up to 19,000 barrels (798,000 gallons) of oil pouring into the Gulf daily, according to federal estimates. BP, rig owner Transocean and oilfield services contractor Halliburton have all pointed fingers at one another for the disaster. A crew of scientists who just returned from an eight-day mission researching the underwater oil impact of the spill has found life forms near the breached well head, officials with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Friday. The researchers aboard the 224-foot Gordon Gunter found ""ample evidence of a lot of zooplankton,"" said NOAA Administrator Jane Lubchenco. ""It's not a dead zone. There's still a lot of life there."" Zooplankton are organisms that drift through bodies of water, and many of them are not visible to the naked eye. The question, she said, is how much of an impact the oil from the Deepwater Horizon disaster will ultimately have. The researchers took underwater samples from within 3 nautical miles (3.45 miles) of the well head. The scientist are trying to determine how much oil is out there, in what concentrations and where it came from, Lubchenco said, adding that they ""can't assume all the oil that is out there is from the Deepwater Horizon -- some of it may be from other sources.""","Researchers confirm existence of oil plumes beneath the surface .

"Pensacola, Florida (CNN) -- As oil drifted onto beaches as far east as the Florida Panhandle, a BP official said Saturday the company was pleased with its operation to funnel crude up from the ruptured undersea well to a drilling ship a mile above on the Gulf of Mexico. BP Senior Vice President Bob Fryar said the company funneled about 250,000 gallons of oil in the first 24 hours from a containment cap installed on the well to a drilling ship on the ocean surface. ""That operation has gone extremely well,"" Fryar said at an Alabama news conference. ""We are very pleased."" That's about 31 percent of the 798,000 gallons of crude federal authorities estimate is gushing into the sea every day. The company's progress was not enough to temper the frustration seething among residents along the coastline. Tony Kennon, the mayor of Orange Beach, Alabama, confronted Fryar at the afternoon news conference for not acting promptly when reports of tar balls washing ashore surfaced. Visibly upset, Kennon said local officials have been asking to meet with BP officials for over a month, but their requests went unanswered. ""If you sensed our frustration, you would have been here a lot sooner,"" Kennon told Fryar. ""People in Orange Beach are starving to death now because they can't get out to catch the fish."" BP engineers are hoping to increase the amount being funneled to the drilling ship but have to be careful about the pressure within the cap that was placed on the well head a few days ago, said Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen, the federal government's response manager. Allen told reporters at a briefing Saturday that BP plans to shut valves in the cap -- which are allowing oil to escape -- once the pressure is eased. The ultimate capacity of the operation is 630,000 captured gallons a day, still shy of the amount spewing. Earlier, coastal residents had anxiously awaited news of BP's progress as elevated southerly winds pushed the perimeter of the spilled oil to shorelines as far east as the Florida Panhandle. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted that scattered tar balls and light sheen would impact beaches as far east as Bay County, home to popular destinations in Panama City. Florida beaches remained open Saturday but the number of beachgoers was down. Sun and surf were interrupted by sticky brown globs of oil washing up on the sugary sand and workers with blue rubber gloves and plastic bags trying to keep the beach clean. Florida Gov. Charlie Crist walked the beach accompanied by ""Margaritaville"" singer Jimmy Buffet, who is building a hotel on the Pensacola shoreline. ""I saw some tar balls,"" Crist said. ""It's terrible when you see something like that. It breaks your heart."" Florida Sen. George LeMieux, a Republican, demanded that BP donate $1 billion for a cleanup fund for the five Gulf states and said that President Obama ""needs to push them to do that."" ""I want to see this president more engaged here on the ground, working through problems,"" LeMieux said. The oil slick has already threatened ecologically sensitive lands along the Gulf Coast. Images of oil-drenched pelicans were all over the internet, prompting even more public anger toward BP. Obama sought in his weekly address Saturday to ease fear along the Gulf Coast by reaffirming his commitment to clean up the worst oil spill in U.S. history. ""It's brutally unfair. It's wrong,"" Obama said in the address, recorded a day earlier in Grand Isle, Louisiana. ""And what I told these men and women -- and what I have said since the beginning of this disaster -- is that I'm going to stand with the people of the Gulf Coast until they are made whole."" It appeared that BP was making progress after capping the breached well head, Obama said, but he said the federal government was ""prepared for the worst."" He cited a series of statistics that illuminated the ""largest response to an environmental disaster of this kind in the history of our country."" They are as follows: . • 17,500 National Guard troops authorized for deployment. • 20,000 people currently working to protect water and coastlines. • 1,900 vessels are in the Gulf assisting in the cleanup. • 4.3 million feet of boom deployed with another 2.9 million feet of boom available, enough to stretch 1,300 miles. • 17 staging areas across Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida to rapidly defend sensitive shorelines. Meanwhile, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Saturday reopened an area of the Gulf to fishing. After reviewing images and data, the agency reopened more than 13,000 square miles west of the Florida Keys and Dry Tortugas. At the same time, it closed 2,275-square miles off the Florida Panhandle, extending the northern boundary just east of the western edge of Choctawhatchee Bay. That means that 32 percent of the Gulf still remains off-limits for fishing. The BP well erupted after an explosion and fire on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig on April 20. Eleven people on board died and the BP-leased rig sank two days later, leaving up to 19,000 barrels (798,000 gallons) of oil pouring into the Gulf daily, according to federal estimates. BP has struggled to contain the gushing oil, trying myriad methods to plug the well and divert the crude. Thursday was the first time the British oil giant was able to report progress, when it successfully lowered a containment cap on the ruptured well. Even if the funneling procedure is able to contain most of the oil, the solution is temporary, Allen said. The gushing well can only be killed after BP completes drilling of two relief wells. Allen said the first relief well is about 7,000 feet below the ocean floor. BP will have to go down to between 16,000 and 18,000 feet to be able to intercept the breached well. The long-term threat, Allen said, will not go away until a relief well is completed. BP has said the earliest that will be done is August.","NEW: BP official ""pleased"" with containment progress .

"(CNN) -- When I won the reality show competition ""Survivor: Africa"" in 2001, I never dreamed that an obscure African flower would provide the drug that later helped me survive cancer. But that's the way my life has unfolded. One day I was battling opponents for a million dollars, the next I was battling lymphoma for my life. I couldn't have won either fight without having nature on my side. Now I'm working hard to protect natural areas that will provide the source of future drugs that could save millions of lives. On the show we were expected to live off the land. I learned very early that survival would mean figuring out how to work with, rather than against, nature. We used thorny acacia plants to keep predators away from our camp. We drank from the same watering hole as elephants and giraffes, learning the best times to drink and how to stay out of their way. Nature was a good teacher. I won $1 million and the confidence that I could survive just about any challenge. In 2009, I was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma, and it turned out that the confidence I gained on ""Survivor"" proved even more valuable than the million dollars. But not even the trials of the show could have prepared me for the greatest struggle of my life. Chemotherapy drugs wracked my body for months. But as they worked I found some comfort when I learned that one of them was derived from an African flower, the rosy periwinkle. The drug born of this flower, vincristine, was part of the regimen that saved my life. My cancer is now in remission and once again I owe my survival to working with nature. My case is not an isolated one. It turns out that dozens of plants in nature manufacture anti-cancer agents as chemical defenses. Scientists figured this out years ago, and 80 percent of all anti-cancer drugs possess an active ingredient from the natural world. This promise extends to other diseases as well, with half the new drugs created in the past 25 years derived from nature. According to a recent study, natural drugs and related products are used to treat 87 percent of all known diseases, including cancer, heart disease, diabetes and HIV. Yet this pharmaceutical pipeline is in danger. Researchers unraveled the biochemistry of the snakeroot plant to improve the treatment of hypertension, but the plant is now threatened by deforestation in Indonesia. Scientists derived a compound for treating severe chronic pain from a cone snail found in Pacific coral reefs, though its habitat is now threatened by destructive fishing practices and marine pollution. The first antiviral medication approved for the treatment of HIV/AIDS came from a marine sponge, yet marine habitats around the world are threatened by pollution, overfishing and climate change. Given the accelerating destruction of rainforests, reefs and other natural habitats around the world, we must take action today -- as there's no telling how many useful undiscovered natural compounds we could lose for tomorrow. Right now, there's a bipartisan bill in Congress, the Global Conservation Act of 2010, that seeks to address extinction and natural resource depletion worldwide by laying out a strategy for helping other countries protect millions of square miles of natural habitat. President Obama must put his weight behind this bill and the Congress must pass it soon. According to the World Conservation Union, more than 16,000 species, plant and animal alike, are in danger of extinction, largely because of human activities. Indeed, scientists warn that two-thirds of the planet's 10 million species could face extinction by the end of the century. Time is not on our side. I won ""Survivor: Africa,"" and I've won my battle against cancer. But in each case, I didn't do it alone. I had the most unlikely of partners: a small watering hole and, later, a flower. I don't know what I'll need from nature next or where the newest nature-based medicines will come from, but I'm not willing to risk losing any of them. The rosy periwinkle saved my life. Who knows what could save yours?","Winner of TV's ""Survivor: Africa"" beat cancer with chemo from African plant .

"(CNN)  -- The bodies of four men kidnapped from a wedding in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, have been found in the bed of a pickup truck in the city, municipal police said Tuesday. The men, kidnapped Friday, included the groom, Rafael Morales; his brother, Jaime Morales; and their uncle, Guadalupe Morales, municipal police spokesman Jacinto Seguro said. The fourth person's name has not been released. All the bodies showed signs of torture, Seguro said. The bodies were found Monday afternoon and were identified on Tuesday, he said. ""It's very sad, but, well ... that seems to be the situation,"" he added. The FBI has information that Rafael Morales was a U.S. citizen from La Mesa, New Mexico, and others may be as well, said Special Agent Andrea Simmons of the El Paso, Texas, FBI office. The FBI offered assistance this weekend to local and federal police in Mexico, Simmons said, but neither has requested anything so far. The men were kidnapped after gunmen stormed into the church in the middle of the wedding ceremony on Friday, Chihuahua State Attorney General's Office spokesman Carlos Gonzalez said Saturday. A fifth man was fatally shot in the incident, Gonzalez said. ""It's unclear if this was gang- or drug-related,"" he said. Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, is the most violent city in Mexico, with more than 2,600 drug-related deaths in 2009. At least 870 people have been killed in the city this year, according to local reports. According to a report released in April by the Mexican government, Chihuahua is the Mexican state hardest hit by drug violence, with 6,757 people killed since the end of 2006.

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Thousands packed Havana's Revolution Square on Saturday for International Workers' Day, drawing hordes of Cuban demonstrators, spectators, and trade unionists from around the world -- including the United States and the United Kingdom. ""I've never seen anything like it,"" said Brian Hattsberger, a British labor unionist in attendance, wiping the sweat from his brow with his red labor hat. ""It's just amazing."" For years, since Cuba's bearded revolutionaries toppled dictator Fulgencio Batista over half a century ago, residents have gathered in Havana on May 1 to listen to hours-long speeches from their former president, Fidel Castro. The elder Castro made his last showing in 2006 before stepping down because of illness, at first temporarily and then permanently, leaving the reins to his younger brother, Raul. Since then, neither Castro has made a major speech on May Day. This year was no different. In a carefully choreographed show of force, thousands took to the streets, carrying placards with the faces of Che Guevara, Fidel Castro and Raul Castro, and waving Cuban flags as they sang and sweated beneath the hot Caribbean sun. ""I am marching for Cuba and for the Cuban revolution,"" said one Cuban marcher as she passed through the square. Cuba had billed this year's march as a rebuke to international criticism from Europe and Washington over human rights issues recently bubbling up in the Communist nation. In February, dissident Orlando Zapata Tamayo, who was jailed in 2003 during a crackdown on political opposition, died after a hunger strike that lasted for more than 80 days. He began the strike to demand better prison conditions. In an unprecedented government statement, Raul Castro said he ""lamented the death of Cuban prisoner Orlando Zapata Tamayo, who died after leading a hunger strike."" He blamed the United States for the death, but did not explain why. ""Tortured people do not exist,"" Castro added. Recently, an opposition group that calls itself the ""Ladies in White"" -- made up of relatives of dissidents jailed in the 2003 crackdown -- has met recurring resistance from large groups of pro-government demonstrators, who surround the women and drown out their chants of ""Freedom"" with such phrases as ""This street belongs to Fidel."" The women on occasion are detained briefly by police before being driven back to their homes. Saturday marked the second International Workers' Day since U.S. President Obama took office. At the time of his election, Obama elicited a sense among many Cubans that they might finally see an end to the economic trade embargo that has been in place since the administration of President John F. Kennedy. While Obama eased restrictions on small-ticket items such as family travel and telecommunications, and sent high-ranking envoys to Havana to foster fresh migration talks, broader discussions now appear at a standstill following a storm of criticism over Zapata's death and increasingly routine counter-demonstrations in support of the government that overpower the handful of weekly protests. Saturday's May Day march began around 8 a.m. and lasted roughly two hours without incident.","Thousands of Cuban demonstrators, trade unionists gather from around world .

"(CNN) -- A tsunami warning was canceled Friday for Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands and New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean when the threat from a 7.2-magnitude earthquake had passed. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center issued the warning early Friday when the quake struck near the island of Vanuatu, saying that an earthquake of that size ""has the potential to generate a destructive tsunami that can strike coastlines in the region near the epicenter within minutes to hours."" There were no reports of serious damage or injuries. The earthquake was 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) deep, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Its epicenter was 215 kilometers (135 miles) from Luganville, Vanuatu. It struck at 4:14 a.m. Friday (1:14 p.m. Thursday ET), the USGS said. The USGS initially classified the quake as a 7.6 -magnitude, but later downgraded it.","Warning canceled for Vanuatu, Solomon Islands and New Caledonia .

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- Investigators were searching for bodies in a mangled wreck Saturday, a day after two trains crashed and killed at least 98 people in eastern India, officials said. Maoist rebels are suspected of causing the crash by removing the fasteners securing the tracks, police said. Authorities identified some suspects, but had not yet made any arrests, said Bhupinder Singh, police chief in West Bengal state. He said ""quite a few"" people were involved. At least 115 passengers were injured when 13 cars of the Mumbai-bound Lokmanya Tilak Gyaneshwari Express derailed, capsized on a parallel track and were slammed by a cargo train, authorities said. More than a dozen bodies may still be trapped inside the wreckage, said N.S. Nigam, West Midnapore district magistrate. Singh told reporters Friday that officers had found Maoist posters claiming responsibility for the attack. ""It appears to be a case of sabotage where a portion of the railway track was removed. Whether explosives were used is not yet clear,"" Indian Home Minister P. Chidambaram said in a statement Friday. Manoj Verma, the district police superintendent, said Friday that investigators were looking into the possibility that ""fishplates,"" which secure rail joints, were missing from the track. The role of Maoists ""cannot be ruled out,"" Verma said. India regards Maoists as its gravest internal security threat. More than 70 officers were killed in a suspected Maoist ambush in Chhattisgarh state last month in what was seen as one of the most daring attacks by the left-wing guerrillas on Indian security forces. The insurgents, on the other hand, have claimed since the 1960s to be fighting for the dispossessed. In February, Chidambaram said that more than 900 people, including almost 600 civilians, were killed in Maoist-related incidents in 2009. About 200 suspected rebels were also slain as forces moved into areas under insurgent control, he said.","At least 98 people killed after passenger train jumps track and slams into freight train .

"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- Anti-whaling activist Peter Bethune testified in a trial Monday that he had no intention of hurting anyone when he protested Japan's whale hunt. The New Zealand activist from the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, standing trial in Tokyo District Court, said that he believed bottles of butyric acid he threw at the Shonan Maru 2 whaling ship were non-toxic and would not harm anyone. Bethune faces five charges, including assault against whalers and trespassing into a whaling vessel. He pleaded guilty last week to all charges but assault. If convicted, Bethune faces a maximum of 15 years behind bars. At Monday's hearing he tearfully described the January collision between the Shonan Maru 2 and the Sea Shepherd's multi-million-dollar speedboat, the Ady Gil. The crash sunk the Ady Gil, which Bethune captained. Weeks later, Bethune jumped aboard the Shonan Maru 2 and attempted to make a citizen's arrest of the captain. He was arrested and brought back to Japan to face criminal charges. In court last week, Bethune admitted to all the charges, except for assault. ""I admit that I boarded the Shonan Maru, but I believe that I have good reason to do so,"" he said. ""I admit that I fired the butyric acid, but there were additional circumstances that we will discuss in court."" Prosecutors say the butyric acid burned two crew members of the Japanese whaling fleet, but Sea Shepherd calls it a harmless, albeit rancid, liquid. Butyric acid is found in rancid butter and vomit. Bethune's case is the first time a Sea Shepherd activist has been tried in a Japanese criminal court in the group's long-running battle with Japan's whalers in the icy waters of the Antarctic. Japan annually hunts whales in the Antarctic, despite a worldwide moratorium on whaling, under the loophole that a country may legally do so if its purpose is scientific research. Sea Shepherd has claimed the science argument is a sham, noting that the whale meat then gets sold in Japanese markets and served in restaurants. A verdict is expected June 10. CNN's Yoko Wakatsuki and Junko Ogura contributed to this report.","Anti-whaling activist facing charges of assault, trespassing .

"(Mental Floss) -- Dozens of companies use acronyms or initials in their names, but how well do you know what the abbreviated letters mean? Let's take a look at the etymologies behind a few abbreviated company names. 1. CVS . Sorry, drugstore fans, there aren't three fat cat pharmacists with these initials running around out there. When the pharmacy chain was founded in Lowell, Massachusetts, in 1963, it was known as ""Consumer Value Stores."" Over time the name became abbreviated to simply CVS. 2. K-Mart . Longtime five-and-dime mogul Sebastian S. Kresge opened his first larger store in Garden City, Michigan, in 1962. The store was named K-Mart after him. (Kresge had earned the right to have a store named for him; he opened up his new venture at the tender age of 94.) 3. IKEA . The Swedish furniture giant and noted charity takes its name from founder Ingvar Kamprad's initials conjoined with a the first initial of the farm where Kamprad grew up, Elmtaryd, and the parish he calls home, Agunnaryd. 4. DHL . In the late 1960s, Larry Hillblom was a broke student at the University of California, Berkeley's law school, so to pick up a bit of extra cash, he would make courier runs from San Francisco. After he finished law school, he decided the courier business was the real racket for him, so he recruited his pals Adrian Dalsey and Robert Lynn to help him with the runs. Although they started out making their delivery trips in a single Plymouth Duster, the company quickly took off, and they named it after their respective last initials. Mental Floss: Mojave Desert's airplane graveyard . 5. AT&T . No surprises here. The telecom giant sprang to life in 1885 as American Telephone and Telegraph, although it's now legally known as just AT&T. 6. JBL . The speaker company is named after its founder, James Bullough Lansing. But if Lansing had kept his original name, the company might have been called Martini Speakers. Lansing was born James Martini in 1902, but when he was 25, he changed his name to James Lansing at the suggestion of the woman who would become his wife. (The martini was already a popular cocktail at the time, and several of Lansing's brothers had also changed their name by shortening it to Martin.) 7. 3M . The conglomerate behind Post-It Notes gets its name from its roots as a company that mined stone to make grinding wheels. Since it was located in Two Harbors, Minnesota, the company was known as Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, which was later shortened to 3M. 8. BVD . The stalwart men's underwear maker was originally founded by a group of New Yorkers named Bradley, Voorhees, and Day to make women's bustles. Eventually the trio branched out into knitted union suits for men, and their wares became so popular that ""BVDs"" has become a generic term for any underwear. 9. H&M . The beloved clothing store began in Sweden in 1947. Founder Erling Persson was only selling women's duds, so he called the store Hennes -- Swedish for ""hers."" Twenty-one years later, he bought up a hunting supplier called Mauritz Widforss. After the acquisition, Persson branched out into men's clothing and began calling the store Hennes and Mauritz, which eventually became shortened to H&M. 10. A&W Root Beer . Roy Allen opened his first root beer stand in Lodi, California, in the summer of 1919, and quickly began expanding to the surrounding areas. Within a year he had partnered with Frank Wright, and the pair christened their flagship product ""A&W Root Beer."" 11. GEICO . The adorable gecko's employer is more formally known as the Government Employees Insurance Company. Although GEICO has always been a private, standalone company, its name reflects its original purpose: Leo Goodwin founded the company in 1936 to sell insurance directly to employees of the federal government. Mental Floss: 15 companies that originally sold something else . 12. YKK . The initials you see on darn near every zipper you own stand for Yoshida Kogyo Kabushikigaisha, which translates into ""Yoshida Manufacturing Corporation."" The company is named after Tadao Yoshida, who started the zipper concern in Tokyo in 1934. 13. P.F. Chang's . If you go looking for Mr. P.F. Chang, you'll be in for a long search. The Asian dining chain's name is actually a composite of the founding restaurateur Paul Fleming's initials and a simplification of founding chef Philip Chiang's last name. 14. BJ's Wholesale Club . The bulk retailer is named after Beverly Jean Weich, whose father, Mervyn, helped found the chain as a spinoff from discount retailer Zayre in 1983. Mental Floss: 10 snack foods originally sold as medicines . 15. ING Group . The banking giant's name is an abbreviation of Internationale Nederlanden Groep, or ""International Netherlands Group,"" a nod to the company's dutch origins and headquarters. The company's heavy use of the color orange in its buildings and promotion is also a shoutout to the Netherlands; orange is the color of the Dutch royal family dating all the way back to William of Orange. 16. H&R Block . Brothers Henry and Richard Bloch founding the tax preparation firm in Kansas City in 1955. Their only problem was their last name. The brothers worried that people would mispronounce their surname as ""blotch,"" hardly a term you want associated with your tax return. They decided to sidestep this problem by spelling the company's name ""Block"" instead, so that nobody would miss the solid hard ""k"" sound.","Ever wonder about the stories behind names like CVS or H&M or IKEA?

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- If Dennis Hopper attends the dedication of his star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame Friday, it may be the last time his fans see the actor alive. Hopper is dying of prostate cancer, according to documents filed in his divorce case this week. Hopper's acting career has spanned almost six decades. In the '50s he had roles in several TV shows and films, including ""Rebel Without a Cause"" (1955) and ""Giant"" (1956). He became a Hollywood sensation for ""Easy Rider,"" the 1969 film he directed and co-wrote in which he played a dissolute, countercultural biker. He was twice nominated for Oscars. Hopper, 73, is undergoing radical chemotherapy for advanced, metastasized prostate cancer, his doctor said. He is too weak and ill to be questioned by lawyers in the divorce, but attending Friday's ceremony ""is a positive experience in every way,"" his doctor's sworn statement said. Hopper's lawyer has not confirmed if the actor will attend the ceremony in front of the Egyptian Theater on Hollywood Boulevard, but his doctor is recommending it. ""I believe the ceremony honoring his career may be something which he will actually enjoy in the company of his daughter, who he hopes will attend with him,"" Dr. David Argus said. Dennis and Victoria Hopper married 14 years ago and they have a 6-year-old daughter, Galen. They separated in January when he filed for divorce, claiming the stress of their relationship was threatening his life as he battled cancer. ""The presence of his estranged wife is hampering Mr. Hopper's present cancer care as she introduces significant additional stress into his life,"" Argus said. ""The less Mr. Hopper has to do with his estranged wife at this time, the more likely he is to have his life extended."" Hopper's lawyer, Joseph Mannis, argued that Victoria Hopper, knowing he was ""extremely ill and fragile, repeatedly engaged in conduct which appears to have been calculated to subject [Hopper] to severe emotional distress."" This distress ""subjected [Hopper] to a significant risk of causing his premature death,"" Mannis wrote. The divorce case is set for an April 5 hearing in Los Angeles County Superior Court, but lawyers for Victoria Hopper are trying to force Dennis Hopper to take part in a deposition. His lawyer and doctor told the judge it could kill him. ""Compelling Mr. Hopper to participate in a deposition where he is being asked questions he is compelled to respond to under oath regarding his wife and/or his daughter could actually threaten his ability to survive his current health crisis,"" Argus wrote. Hopper, who weighs ""a little over 100 pounds,"" is ""extremely weak and extremely ill, and he tires very quickly,"" he said. Emily Davis, Hopper's personal assistant, said in a sworn statement that Hopper is ""only able to have brief conversations at times when his nurses permit him to have such conversations and then only for very short periods of time."" ""He is not able to concentrate and he tires quickly,"" Davis said. The court filing also contends that Hopper's finances have dwindled with his illness. An affidavit from his accountant said the cost of his cancer treatments exceed his income, which is $58,000 in annual residual payments from his TV and movie roles. His last acting job was last year when he completed the television series ""Crash.""","Hopper is dying of prostate cancer, say documents in divorce case .

"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- Toyota returned to profits for the fiscal year ending in March, despite the continuing economic downturn and a series of recalls that rattled consumer confidence in the United States, the Japanese automaker said Tuesday. Toyota reported an annual profit of 209 billion yen ($2.2 billion) over the last year, the company said at a news conference. That figure compares to a loss of 437 billion yen for fiscal year 2008. This is ""still in a tough storm, but we are starting to see some sun on the horizon,"" Toyota President Akio Toyoda said, noting the challenge his company has faced in the wake of a continuing economic downturn and the recall of some 10 million of its cars. Net revenues for the fiscal year decreased of 7.7 percent compared to 2009, while operating revenue for the year recovered from a loss of 461 billion yen to a profit of 147.5 billion yen, the company announced. Cost-cutting measures helped make Toyota profitable. Vehicle sales for the fiscal year totaled 7.24 million units, a decrease of 330,000 units from the preceding fiscal year, Toyota said. Sales were up by 218,00 vehicles in Japan and another 74,000 units across the rest of Asia. The story was different in the United States and Europe, where sales fell by 114,000 and 204,000 units. Toyota cars and trucks have been the subject of at least three separate major recalls in the past year. One was for the ""sticky pedal"" situation in which gas pedals, as they age, begin to stick in a partially depressed position. Another was for gas pedals that can stick on some floor mats, and a third was for braking problems on Toyota Prius hybrid cars. In April, Toyota indicated to the U.S. government it would pay a $16.4 million fine -- the largest ever against an automaker -- for failing to notify the Department of Transportation of the ""sticky pedal"" defect for at least four months. Despite the problems, Toyota announced in late April that production soared more than 80 percent in March compared to year-ago levels. Toyota Tuesday predicted sales growth across the board for 2011, pinning its hopes on green cars and the emerging markets like India and China.","Toyota reports $2.2 billion profit for fiscal year 2009 that ended on March 31, 2010 .

"(CNN) -- Noah Baumbach is emerging as an emotionally acute, not to say eviscerating, observer of the middle-class intelligentsia, the kind of people who write letters to ""The New York Times"" and might plausibly pop up in a Woody Allen movie. Unlike the Woodman, Baumbach doesn't show his face on screen, but his films are no less personal for that: ""The Squid and the Whale"" was a sometimes wincingly autobiographical account of two boys torn between their divorcing parents, and he's not one to deflect an insight with a wisecrack. The cracks just cut deeper. I've rarely experienced an audience recoil from a character as passionately as they did to Nicole Kidman's toxically self-absorbed writer in ""Margot at the Wedding"" (maybe her best performance, incidentally). These are comedies in the sense that the characters are painfully ridiculous -- and all too recognizably real -- but Baumbach sure doesn't make it easy for himself, or us. Roger Greenberg (Ben Stiller) is another neurotic narcissist, a middle-aged loner who comes back to Los Angeles to house-sit while his brother enjoys a long vacation in the Far East. Greenberg (only his brother calls him Roger) can feed the family dog, but the truth is that he desperately needs to regroup and recharge after a spell in a mental hospital. He has one friend, Ivan (Rhys Ifans), who still has time for him and a wider circle of former friends who don't. We soon learn that Greenberg used to front a band, but it fell apart after he turned down a recording deal, and he's been in New York ever since, under-achieving on a permanent basis. ""I'm trying to do nothing for a while,"" is how he explains himself to anyone who will listen. Stiller finds a note of defiance in this pathetic rationalization (along with his powerlessness, Greenberg has developed an angry streak), but it's clear to almost everyone how lost he really is. He's living in the past, fantasizing about his old girlfriend (a deftly ironic cameo by Baumbach's wife, Jennifer Jason Leigh) and scarcely able to look after himself, let alone his brother's dog. It's hard to believe this hunched misanthrope grew up in sunny California -- he can barely doggy-paddle and always dresses for rain -- but Stiller knows him inside out. He shows us someone trapped in his own disappointment, flailing and failing. Then there's Florence (Greta Gerwig), his brother's personal assistant/nanny, a wannabe singer who defaults to doormat status in almost any social exchange. Greenberg throws himself on her with an awkward mixture of condescension and vulnerability, and their fumbling relationship -- physical but scarcely intimate -- serves as a kind of love story, or at least the unspoken promise of one. It's crucial to Baumbach's strategy that Gerwig (a mainstay of the new millennial American independent scene) is ordinarily beautiful, not movie-star knockout. Florence is self-conscious and unsure of herself, which is why she'll drive Greenberg around (he doesn't drive) even after he's walked out on her twice. Uneventful (the dog gets sick, and, uh, that's about it), ""Greenberg"" resembles the kind of films Gerwig has been making (""LOL,"" ""Baghead""), but on a bigger budget and with one of Hollywood's most accomplished cinematographers on board (Harris Savides, whose credits include ""Zodiac"" and ""Milk""). That is, it coalesces around tentative, half-formed ideas about how to be a person in the world. ""Greenberg"" shows that young people aren't the only ones wondering what they're to make of themselves and whether it's already too late. Its best sequence, the climax, is an impromptu house party in which Greenberg finds himself pontificating, stoned, before a bemused audience half his age -- and at long last manages to accept himself. It's a small victory but worth savoring.","Director Noah Baumbach is best known for ""The Squid and the Whale""

"(CNN) -- Nevada sheriff's deputies descended Thursday on Wayne Newton's 38-acre ranch with movers in tow to carry out a debt-collection action, but were rebuffed, officials told CNN. The deputies from the department's civil process service were turned away from the property and returned to the Clark County Courthouse in Las Vegas. The entertainer known as ""Mr. Las Vegas"" was facing debt collection of more than $455,000 from a breached contract with a man identified in court documents as Monty Ward. Thursday's action by the deputies was Ward's attempt to use the legal options available to him to collect on the judgment, an attorney connected to the case told CNN. The judgment is dated January 27. Because Ward had not been paid, he was taking other steps to collect, the attorney said. Ward's is not the only civil action related to finances that Newton faces. Bruton Smith sued Newton this year in an attempt to get repayment on a $3.35 million loan. Newton's home, which he had put up as collateral, could be at risk, court records show.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama met Wednesday with U.S. Army Gen. Ray Odierno to get a first-hand account of conditions in Iraq from the top commander for the country. A White House spokesman said Odierno ""provided a positive assessment"" of security conditions and the transfer of responsibilities to Iraqi security forces ahead of completing the planned withdrawal of most U.S. troops by the end of August. In addition, Obama and Odierno discussed the recent certification of election results by Iraq's Federal Supreme Court and efforts to form an inclusive Iraqi government, according to White House deputy press secretary Bill Burton. Odierno is responsible for determining the pace of withdrawal of American forces from Iraq, but the Obama administration has said the deadline for bringing home all but 50,000 troops by the end of August remains on schedule despite the recent spike in violence there. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Saturday found that 64 percent of Americans favor the president's plan to keep the 50,000 U.S. troops in Iraq by the end of the summer, with 35 percent opposed. But the national poll indicated that support for the planned removal could drop significantly if Iraq cannot solve its current problems in coming months.

"(CNN) -- Soccer superstar David Beckham will spearhead England's presentation of the country's official bid document for the 2018 World Cup hosting rights. Beckham, who will miss this year's tournament in South Africa due to injury, will lead the English Football Association delegation to world governing body FIFA's Swiss headquarters on Friday. FIFA will make a decision on December 2 as to which country will be the 2018 host and also for the 2022 event. England, who have also asked to be considered for 2022 if unsuccessful for 2018, will be up against the United States, Russia, Australia and joint bids from Belgium and the Netherlands, and Portugal and Spain. With Europe likely to win the 2018 event, Japan, Qatar and South Korea are bidding for only 2022 hosting rights. Beckham will be able to play a more active role in England's bid due to the ruptured Achilles he suffered while on loan at Italian club AC Milan, which has also ruled him out of the Los Angeles Galaxy's Major League Soccer season. He has already contributed to the campaign, taking part in an expo for bidding nations last December. ""It's fantastic news that David's schedule has enabled him to present and head our bid in Zurich,"" Football Association and bid chairman David Triesman told the FA Web site on Monday. ""It is entirely appropriate that he does so as our bid is about football and the passion for it in our country. Nobody represents that better than David. He is a fantastic footballer and a global role model."" England's bid book will feature proposals for stadiums, training venues, base camps and fan parks. The FA said about 16 stadiums are required with minimum capacities of between 40,000 for group matches and 80,000 for the opening match and final.

"(CNN) -- The design of America's embassies overseas might seem at best a mere question of bricks and mortar or a relatively arcane issue in a time of big challenges. But as we wage a global battle for hearts and minds, embassies can send a powerful message to people everywhere about what America stands for. As the first impression many foreign people have of the United States, embassies can be another force in our arsenal to convey who we really are, to bring allies closer to us, and, yes, even to make us safer. Unfortunately, many of our embassies are not sending the right message. Our diplomats are engaged in heroic and difficult work every day. But too often, their buildings -- cold concrete at a forbidding distance, hidden away from city life, with little regard for the local surroundings --  undermine our diplomats' message and even their mission. We need to think creatively about how we can create embassies that protect our diplomats but also project our values. For decades, we hired world-class architects to design buildings that inspired people, conveyed our spirit of openness and represented the best of our country. Tragically, that same symbolic power also attracted the attention of our enemies. From the Iranian hostage crisis to the African embassy bombings, embassies have been a frequent and deadly target. Our initial response to the dangers our diplomats faced was to hunker down. Diplomats were shunted from urban settings and city centers, where our diplomatic partners reside, and placed in distant suburban locations -- often far from any government ministries or agencies. Speeding up embassy construction and updating facilities to protect our diplomats against terrorist attacks was sorely needed. Under Secretary of State Colin Powell's leadership, the department embarked on a construction program that has led to the completion of 71 new facilities and moved over 20,000 people to safer and more secure buildings since 2001. Although this effort significantly improved the safety of our diplomats, unique architectural wonders built to last were replaced by a standardized ""embassy in a box."" They are uniform in appearance and quickly assembled fortresses designed to meet security specifications in one of four sizes -- small, medium, large and extra-large, epitomized by our supersized embassy in Baghdad. Congress, too, got into the act, putting speed and cost ahead of our support for the kinds of iconic embassies we built during the Cold War. This contributed to a system where embassy projects are evaluated first and foremost for cost efficiency, with design and location relegated to the status of afterthought. Such designs and locations are sometimes necessary, but our Foreign Service officers will be the first to tell you that they make it much more difficult to reach deep into societies to conduct real diplomacy. Let us be clear: Our diplomats risk their lives daily. Their security will always come first. But because diplomats are already taking such risks, we want to empower them to achieve their mission. If the job of diplomats is to reach out to people, promote U.S. values, obtain and share information, and help advance our diplomatic agenda, then we have to build embassies that neither compromise our diplomats' safety nor their work. Many are coming to realize that justifiable concerns over security swung the pendulum too far. Recently, the State Department announced the construction of a new embassy in London, England, after a highly publicized international architectural competition. Unlike less welcoming U.S. Embassy designs in places like Accra, Ghana, and Tbilisi, Georgia, London's facility will feature transparent glass encasing, cutting edge environmentally sustainable design and a central location immediately across the river from Westminster and the U.K. Parliament. Unfortunately, this innovative approach remains the exception, not the rule. We need to recalibrate our approach globally and reconnect our embassy construction with the core mission of diplomacy. The Embassy Design and Security Act is an important first step in a different direction. It establishes a design excellence program at the State Department to instill new thinking, and a design advisory board to provide recommendations on how to integrate the most modern security requirements with a new generation of bolder, more innovative, energy-efficient and sustainable high performance embassies. The bill also directs the State Department to ensure new embassies adhere to the highest standards of energy efficiency and sustainability. We ask countries to transform the way they use energy; our overseas construction represents an important sign of our good faith and a chance to lead by example. Above all, the legislation represents an explicit political commitment to an essential truth: Inevitably, our embassies and consulates project our values. They should be public expressions of openness, innovation and boldness. Every day, our enemies try to sell the world a distorted vision of an unwelcoming America indifferent to the concerns of people everywhere. Our embassies need to help our diplomats to tell the world the truth.

"(CNN) -- What is it about Christmas music that enters our very souls, calms us and even gets us to do things that are right for humanity? This music even has the ability to make us like our old Aunt Emily. If there were a marketing campaign for Christmas, it would be the most successful campaign ever devised. Paintings of angels protecting sheep or a masterly rendition of the manger scene certainly evoke emotion. Then there's a good Christmas story. In 1843, Charles Dickens gave us ""A Christmas Carol."" This literary gift had the power to make us actually give a farthing or two to the needy. However, it is music and song that has no rival in the ability to stir raw emotions. It doesn't matter what your religious persuasion is. Most people can recite and hum the Christmas carols they've heard repeatedly since childhood. Among the most familiar are the pop songs: ""Santa Claus is Coming To Town,"" which the Four Seasons, Bruce Springsteen and Bing Crosby all performed; Gene Autry's ""Here Comes Santa Claus""; Elvis Presley's ""Blue Christmas""; and Brenda Lee's ""Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree."" Then there's one that the marketers made sure really goes for the heart -- ""I'll Be Home for Christmas"" -- and the line, ""if only in my dreams."" I forgot how lonely and depressed I was until I heard that song. The ""home for Christmas"" notion originates during World War I, when U.S. soldiers expected a quick victory, thinking they'd be back in the United States in time for the holidays. That was not the case, and the song was a huge hit decades later -- in 1943. Speaking of hits, there's ""White Christmas"" -- more than 500 different recordings were made of this song; which was originally written for the movie ""Holiday Inn."" These songs conjure up old family photos of relatives here and long gone. We say, ""Oh my, look here's an old tintype of Aunt Emily -- she was so kind and generous."" (Even if we never really liked her -- but then, it's Christmas.) Next up are the seasonal songs that really have little or nothing to do with the holiday. Once again, those marketers have honed their skills at pulling our sentimental heartstrings. Dean Martin singing ""Let It Snow! Let it Snow! Let it Snow!"" Dinah Shore and Buddy Clark doing ""Baby, it's Cold Outside."" (This song of trying to entice a young lady to stay was written for the film ""Neptune's Daughter,"" with Esther Williams and Ricardo Montalban.) Judy Garland singing ""Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas"" in the 1944 film ""Meet Me In St. Louis"" and dozens more all have great images, and are all seasonal. Did you know that ""Jingle Bells"" was originally titled ""One Horse Open Sleigh"" and was written in the late 1850s by James Pierpont, to be performed during a Thanksgiving service at his Unitarian church in Savannah, Georgia? The congregation enjoyed it so much that it was repeated during Christmas services, and ""Jingle Bells"" took off from there. Of course, Christmas is children. There are the novelty songs written for kids -- like the one about the most famous reindeer of all, Rudolph. He came prancing into our lives when we were young with his shiny red nose and never left the roof. Then there are Jimmy Boyd's ""All I Want For Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth"", The Singing Dogs version of ""Jingle Bells"" and Homer and Jethro's ""Grandma Got Run Over By A Reindeer."" Songs only a kid could like. But my favorite has to be Lou Monte's ""Dominic the Italian Christmas Donkey."" And how about ""I Want A Hippopotamus For Christmas,"" by Gayla Peevey? Somebody please explain why anybody would buy that song. So here's the question: What is this all about? The emotional and often wonderful snapshots of our lives, past and present, all wrapped up for Christmas. Have we been duped into loving this holiday? Absolutely not. I realized a while ago that indeed we all need a little Christmas. The security of home, family and friends is essential. So this marketing campaign that started with our first footsteps is fine -- we need it. Is there a Santa Claus? Have I been a good boy? Or, as Nat King Cole famously asked: Do reindeer really know how to fly? Yes, of course, to all those questions. Wouldn't it have been nice if those marketing guys figured out a way to make those 12 days of Christmas last for the other 353 days of the year? So deck the halls and please stop leaving Santa those fattening chocolate chip cookies -- he's gained a lot of weight during the past 200-plus years. And I say unto ye -- Fa la la la la, la la la la. Happy holidays, cousins. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bruce Morrow.","Bruce Morrow says nothing stirs emotions as powerfully as Christmas songs do .

"Hong Kong, China (CNN) -- The global stock sell-off that began Friday on the back of worse than expected U.S. unemployment data rolled into Asia trade on Monday morning, as stocks opened sharply lower. The euro continued its downward slide. It was trading at $1.19 on Monday morning after falling below $1.20 for the first time in four years on Friday. Traders consider the $1.20 mark a key technical level for the euro. ""It's a pretty big line in the sand, and you don't want to cross it,"" Phil Streible, a senior market strategist with futures broker Lind-Waldock, told CNNMoney. Monday's stock sell-off was led by the Nikkei 225, which was down more than 4 percent near the end of morning trading on Monday. The Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong, the Kospi Composite index in Seoul and the S&P/ASX200 in Sydney were all down more than 2.5 percent in morning trading. Markets plummeted on Friday after a monthly U.S. jobs report said employers added 431,000 jobs in May, below the expected increase of 500,000. Euro jitters continued with fresh concerns that Hungary will join the growing list of European countries saddled by debt. The markets were spooked after Peter Szijjarto, a spokesman for Prime Minister Viktor Orban, was quoted by news agencies as saying Hungary's economy was in a grave situation and that a default was possible.","Asia markets opened sharply lower Monday morning .

"(CNN) -- It was supposed to be a celebration -- sun, fun and relaxation on a tropical island for recent graduates savoring the heady taste of approaching adulthood. But instead, the trip to Aruba by a group of Birmingham, Alabama, high school seniors ended in tragedy, as one of their members, 18-year-old Natalee Holloway, never returned home. Questions surrounding her fate are unanswered five years later. Now, Joran van der Sloot, the youth twice arrested and released in Holloway's disappearance -- seen by many as a privileged playboy who has displayed no remorse or concern over her whereabouts -- has been named a suspect in the stabbing death of a woman in Peru, allegations that hint at a chilling pattern. Holloway was last seen in the early hours of May 30, 2005, leaving an Oranjestad, Aruba, nightclub with van der Sloot and two other men, brothers Deepak and Satish Kalpoe. She was visiting the island with about 100 classmates to celebrate their graduation from Mountain Brook High School in suburban Birmingham. Holloway failed to show up for her flight home the following day, and her packed bags were found in her hotel room. Van der Sloot and the Kalpoes were arrested and released in 2005 in connection with the case, then arrested a second time in 2007 after Aruba's then-chief prosecutor Hans Mos said he had received new evidence in the case. Van der Sloot, then attending college in the Netherlands, was brought back to Aruba. But judges ruled the new evidence -- which included an Internet chat the same day Holloway disappeared with one of the three youths writing that she was dead -- was not enough to keep them in custody. In the years since Holloway vanished, van der Sloot has consistently denied any involvement in her disappearance, police said. ""He's just totally, totally dragged us all through hell,"" Holloway's anguished mother, Beth Twitty, has said. In 2008, a videotape surfaced on Dutch television. In it, van der Sloot tells a man he thought was a friend he had sex with Holloway on the beach after leaving the nightclub, then she ""started shaking"" and lose consciousness. He said he panicked when he could not rescuscitate her and called a friend who had a boat. The two put Holloway in the boat, van der Sloot said, and he went home. The friend told him the next day that he had carried the body out and dumped it into the ocean. ""I don't lose a minute of sleep over it,"" van der Sloot said. He later claimed the account was a lie, saying he told the man what he wanted to hear. A court ruled there was not enough evidence to re-arrest him. Aruba chief prosecutor Peter Blanken said the story was ""unbelievable and not true."" But it's been van der Sloot's cavalier attitude toward the case that has fueled criticism, as well as conflicting statements he's made. He told Fox News in a 2008 interview he sold Holloway to human traffickers for $10,000, then in a taped interview denied it. At the time his name first surfaced in the Holloway investigation, suspicion swirled around his parents, particularly his father, an Aruban lawyer training to be a judge. Paul van der Sloot was briefly taken into custody in 2005 on suspicion of involvement in the Holloway case. Authorities said he told his son that police had no case without a body. He was released after three days of questioning. Holloway's parents, however, have said they met with Paul van der Sloot and continue to believe he had the answers to questions regarding their daughter. ""I remember the day I met with Paul at the prison,"" Dave Holloway has said. ""And the thing that stuck out in my mind was I asked him all the questions, why he hid from the news media. And the last question that I had was, was he involved, and he said no. He said, 'Dave, I can understand your position, but you've got to understand mine. Joran's my son and I'll do everything I can to protect him.' And I believe it."" Van der Sloot's mother, Anita, has said her son told her he was on the beach with Holloway but left her there because she wanted to stay. She has maintained her son's innocence.

"(OPRAH.com) -- My orthopedic surgeon took a few Pringle-like bone shards out of my knee this summer. I made a good recovery, and at our knee-review appointment I asked him if I could go back to playing tennis. ""Well,"" he said, ""that depends on whether you have your mother's knees or your father's knees."" My father played doubles until he was 80; my mother suffered so from arthritis and stenosis that she spent her last years shuffling with a walker. I peered at my legs. The general shape was my mother's, but I didn't know to whom my knee joints really belonged. ""You'll find out,"" the doc said cheerfully. This is what it comes to, in middle age. What do you have that you're stuck with and what do you have that may prove useful and how much room to grow and change and mitigate will you give yourself? When I was around 10, I had an ongoing fantasy of my grown-up life. I lived in a white farmhouse on a hill. Every room was filled with books, and my beautiful English sheepdog, Sydney, lay on the living room window seat. There was no drooling and no shedding. There was also no visible or audible husband, although I had a couple of cute, nearly silent babies. The house was immaculate, and no one did any housework. In real life, my parents also had a lot of books, and the resemblance ended there. Forty years later, I have a nice house -- not as pretty as the one I imagined because I had not, at 10, figured on mortgages, recessions, and the cost of college tuitions -- and no dog, and no wish for a dog. The children are still cute, even beautiful, and grown and rarely silent, and my husband is visible and talkative and not at all what I expected. So, what now? Just as I once saw a life that was as close to Not-My-Parents as possible, I see a future in which my parents' habits and strengths and weaknesses poke up determinedly like weeds through the sidewalk of the next ten years. Oprah.com: The one thing every parent wants . I hope I wind up with my father's cheerful, if impenetrable, view of himself. My father thought, until the day he died, that the way he was, was just fine. Unable to read the newspaper's small print and memory failing? My father declared that as many people got older, they became less interested in world affairs, and he was one of those people. He found it harder to walk around and harder to hear, so he improved his relationship with Bev, his aide at the assisted living facility, and decided he was tired of the dining room hubbub. He said -- and he knew -- that he had been a lucky and successful man who made his life as he wished it to be and refused to feel diminished by the losses of old age. I'd like that staunch satisfaction, for me. I would not like his inability to sustain relationships -- for the relationship gene, I turn to my mother. My mother had friends from the third grade. When she was maybe 70, we were walking up Madison Avenue and a man about her age hailed us from across the street. ""Dellie Cohen! James Madison High!"" She didn't really remember him, but he remembered her. They caught up. ""Everyone loved your mother,"" he said. ""They still do."" (""Ma,"" I said later, ""you were the rock star of James Madison High!"" She smiled.) My mother had weekly conversations with at least six friends. She went on vacations and all-girl getaways about twice a year. She wrote long, fond letters to her grandchildren, bought things that I didn't need and foisted them on me regularly, and kept up with everyone who mattered to her -- in a meaningful way -- for 80 years. I would like that for me, too. Neither of my parents complained about their physical health or other problems, and I am hoping to copy that as well. But there are other ancestral traits I have to watch out for, and I can sometimes feel their ivy twining around me. All my aunts, and my mother, began dyeing their hair as soon as it had more than a sprinkle of gray, and I do, too. But I check in with my daughters, regularly, to make sure that I have not followed in the suddenly-ash-blonde delusion that my mother was so fond of. Most important, my parents were not, for much of their marriage, happy with each other. Even when I was 10, and even with their dance trophies, I could see that. Their troubles led me to a too-early marriage and a painful divorce, but they have also led me to a very happy marriage -- and a couples therapist on retainer. Oprah.com: 5 ways to make anyone like you . The past is one of our clearest indicators of the future. Everything I saw in my parents -- the good and the bad -- has given me something. I am cursed with my mother's arthritis but blessed with my father's stamina; his toughness, her kindness. So, ten years from now: no tennis and no whining. Still working, still loving my friends and family. Still dancing (thanks, Daddy, for teaching me the cha-cha). By Amy Bloom from O, The Oprah Magazine © 2010 .
