"The Food and Drug Administration are reviewing what establishments should be forced to display calorie counts on their menus, with the idea that many people - ordering at a diner, for example - would pass on that bacon double cheeseburger if they realized it had 1,000 calories. The food industry is closely watching what the FDA will chose to include in their new menu labeling rules, which are due out this year. Grocery stores, convenient stores, movie theaters and airplanes are under review - and many aren't happy about it. Non-restaurant establishments have lobbied hard for exemption, which has lead to a delay in the release of the rules. Calorie count menus, which have been commonplace at establishments like McDonalds (pictured) since 2008, look set to be expanded into a whole new line of places that serve prepared food . The FDA believes people would order healthier if they were more aware of the calories in each menu item . FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg told Congress earlier this month that writing the rules has been 'much more challenging than expected'. The agency issued proposed rules in 2011 but has faced pressure to revise them to exclude retail outlets like grocery and convenience stores. The FDA has sent the rules to the White House, meaning they could be released soon. The restaurant industry pushed for menu labeling and helped it become law as part of health overhaul in 2010. Chain restaurants that operate all over the country wanted the federal standards because of an evolving patchwork of state and local laws that require calorie labeling and could have forced those outlets to follow different rules in different locations. Not all restaurants are happy with menu labeling, though. Pizza restaurants, led by delivery giant Domino's, say it doesn't make sense to force their franchisees to order expensive new menu boards when few people walk into their brick-and-mortar outlets. They argue for putting the information online. The pizza companies say there are more than 34 million ways to order a pizza, and they need more flexibility on labeling than other restaurants. Against: Domino's are one of the main establishments fighting the would-be rules, claiming it is intellectual for them to overhaul their menu boards when rarely do people actually order food over-the-counter . Supporters of the rules say pizzas are no different from sandwiches or other foods that have a variety of toppings. The rules will only apply to restaurants with 20 or more outlets, so independent eateries are exempt. Bakeries, coffee shops and ice cream parlors are all expected to be included if they have enough stores to qualify. But alcohol won't have to be labeled in any of those places under the proposed rules. The FDA proposed exempting it. Perhaps the most unhappy with the rules that the FDA proposed in 2011 were the supermarket and convenience store industries were . The agency proposed requiring those stores to label calories for prepared foods on menu boards and displays. The restaurant industry has pushed for those outlets to be included, arguing that many of them are promoting their prepared food sales and directly competing with restaurants. Nutrition advocates have also called for those stores to be included, saying that a rotisserie chicken labeled with a calorie count at a restaurant should also be labeled at the grocery store takeout next door. Same with baked goods like muffins, pies or loaves of bread. Target: Movie theaters are among those most likely to display their calories under the FDA rules, with their snacks often being so unhealthy . The supermarket industry estimates it could cost them a billion dollars to put the rules in place — costs that would be passed on to consumers. Along with convenience stores, the supermarkets say the ever-changing selection at salad bars, deli counters and other prepared food stations would make it difficult and costly to nail down accurate calorie counts and constantly update signs. Both industries argue that the law is intended for restaurants and not for them. They say the labeling rules will be much easier to put in place at restaurants with fixed menus. 'The cost of compliance for a convenience store is different than a one-time cost to McDonald's,' says Lyle Beckwith of the National Association of Convenience Stores. Movie theater chains lobbied to be exempt and appeared to win that fight when they were exempted in the 2011 proposed rules. But nutrition groups are lobbying to include them in the final rules, especially because movie treats can be so unhealthy. Nutrition lobbyist Margo Wootan of the Center for Science in the Public Interest says many people don't realize they are eating a day's worth of calories when they stop by the movie concessions counter and grab a large popcorn and extra-large soda. Vending machines will also display signs indicating the calories of each treat . 'If a company is going to serve you 2,000 calories and call it a snack, the least they can do is tell people how many calories are in it,' Wootan says. Passengers will most likely be able to purchase food calorie-blind in the air and on the rails. Along with movie theaters, airlines and trains were exempted from the proposed labeling rules in 2011. The FDA said that it would likely exempt food served in places where the 'primary business activity is not the sale of food' and that don't 'present themselves publicly as a restaurant'. That also includes amusement parks, sports stadiums and hotels, unless restaurants set up in those places are part of a larger chain. Vending machines will be required to have labels, but the industry — comprised mostly of smaller operators — is asking for flexibility in how they are required to post them. Eric Bell of the National Automatic Merchandising Association says the group estimates the rules could cost operators up to $42,000 a year, which he calls a ""huge burden"" on those small businesses.","New menu labeling rules set to be released by the Food and Drug Administration later this year .

"Calorie counts on nutrition labels and restaurant menus are often incorrect, new evidence suggests. Currently the Atwater system, developed by the U.S. chemist Wilbur Olin Atwater more than 100 years ago, is widely used to determine caloric values. But now experts are calling for a more accurate method to be introduced as Atwater's calculations fail to take into account preparation and processing techniques which can affect the number of calories people consume. Misleading: Experts are calling for a more reliable way of calculating calories in food stuffs as the current method fails to take into account various factors such as as preparation and processing techniques . Rachel Carmody from Harvard University, who is due to give a presentation on the subject at a meeting held by the American . Association for the Advancement of Science this month, told Live Science: 'By getting a better understating of the effective calories in food, we'll get a better sense of human energy requirement.' Ms Carmody previously found that people get more calories from processed foods - pureed vegetables or fruit for example - than unprocessed goods. This is because it takes less energy to digest ingredients in liquid form than in their raw and natural state. Explaining her findings she told MailOnline: 'The calorie values reported on food labels do not capture important costs of digestion that are typically lower for processed foods and higher for unmodified items. 'So although two foods might have the . same number of calories on paper, these calories are not necessarily . equally available to the body. The table below reveals how foods measure up against . the claim on the label. Outback Steakhouse blue cheese wedge side salad . 'In some cases, reported calorie values could differ from actual energy harvest by as much as 50per cent.' She is now hoping to encourage efforts to quantify calories in a more accurate way. 'Given that the Atwater system is . treating essentially all foods the same, we aren’t getting a good . perspective when it comes to making dietary choices. 'We can start to think of simple ways to improve [the system] that will be better for the average consumer,' she added. In the late 19th century Atwater  conducted a series of experiments which involved burning samples of food and measuring the amount of energy released from the heat they produced. He concluded that proteins and . carbohydrates have about 4 calories per gram, fats have 9 calories per . gram, and alcohol has 7 calories per gram. Therefore an energy bar that contains 10g of protein, 20g of carbohydrate and 9g of fat would have 201 calories. This simple formula is how many food manufacturers calculate the calories in foods. In the Seventies, researchers introduced . modified  Atwater values that were intended for specific foods, such as . fruits, vegetables and beans, but since then there have been little changes. Last year David Baer, a research physiologist at . the Human Nutrition Research Center in Beltsville, Maryland, found that  almonds have 32per cent fewer calories than previously estimated. According to the Atwater system a 28 gram serving of almonds has about 170 calories, . but Mr Baer found the energy content of the nuts was around 129 . calories. He explained: 'If we're going to put the information out there on the food label, it would be nice that it's accurate.' Nutritionist Susan Roberts found that soups, salads and sides at restaurants were the worst offenders when it came to items that contained more calories than stated. 'We aren't getting a good . perspective when it comes to making dietary choices' Shockingly the Outback Steakhouse claimed their classic blue cheese wedge side salad had 376 calories, but lab results showed it had a gut-busting 1,035. And a separate study by the Today show last summer found that so-called low-calorie ice creams and frozen yoghurts can contain as much as 68per cent more calories than the labels claim. Ms Roberts said: 'It's really the low-calorie foods that matter more. If you're buying a thousand calorie item, you're probably not counting calories. If you're buying a low-calorie diet item, you don't want it to be off.' Many calorie counts also don't account for the fact that some calories in food are lost as heat. The amount of heat we expend depends on the . components of the food. For proteins, it's about 20 to 30per cent of the . food's calories - so 100 calories of protein would provide around 80 calories - while for fats it's about . 0 to 3per cent - meaning 100 calories worth of fat would equal 97 calories. While many researchers are pushing for improvements to be made to the Atwater system some say that on the . whole, the inaccuracies do not make a big . difference. Malden . Nesheim, professor of nutrition emeritus at Cornell University and co-author of the book Why Calories Count added: 'For most uses, I think they're good enough.'","Harvard University researcher Rachel Carmody is calling for the Atwater system, which is widely used to determine caloric values, to be updated ."
"New figures show that 14 police forces in Britain have seen increased numbers of call-outs related to dementia patients at care homes (file picture) Police are routinely being called to restrain dementia patients in care homes because poorly trained staff cannot cope, it emerged last night. The ‘deeply concerning’ trend is the knock-on effect of a lack of investment in care staff training and the increasing use of agency staff, charities say. At least one force has sent officers to attend a residential home armed with Tasers and riot gear – but did not have to use them after negotiating with the patient. Another force was accused of leaving a confused patient covered in bruises and treating him like a ‘common criminal’ after using ‘fast straps’ – unbreakable plastic ties for the wrists and legs usually used on violent criminals. Chief constables claim they are becoming an ‘extension of the NHS’ and are spending increasing amounts of time responding to problems that were once dealt with by social services and the health service. Figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act reveal that 14 police forces have seen increased numbers of call-outs related to dementia patients, which in some cases involved the use of handcuffs. The numbers of Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards – orders which allow dementia patients to be sedated, restrained or locked in a room for their safety – granted after requests by hospitals and care homes doubled between 2009/10 and 2012/13, figures from the Information Centre for Health and Social Care showed. But, while 6,355 restraint orders were applied for, only 2,979 were granted. Last night George McNamara, of the Alzheimer’s Society, said: ‘This is deeply concerning. We have noticed that there has been an increase in numbers in terms of the police being called out to address similar situations. ‘This is something that should be concerning to the police, too – they are becoming an additional part of social services and in many cases we believe the involvement of police is unnecessary.’ 'With four out of five elderly care home residents suffering from some form of dementia, it was ‘absolutely essential’ all staff were properly trained, Mr McNamara added. ‘In effect, what we are experiencing in terms of our social care is a system which hasn’t significantly invested in its workforce for many, many years. Many homes are staffed by agency staff and not always fully equipped to deliver the best quality care. Police have been called to care homes across Britain, including Silverburn Care Home in Glasgow, to restrain dementia patients. George McNamara, of the Alzheimer’s Society, said the trend was 'deeply concerning' ‘There are different ways of dealing with this sort of behaviour and preventing it in the first place. Training staff and being more understanding about the person, treating them as individuals, means understanding what caused the behaviour. It may be that they are struggling to communicate that they are in pain.’ Bedfordshire Chief Constable Colette Paul said the force was having to recruit volunteer special constables to cover a 14 per cent cut in officer numbers at a time when half of police time was being spent on ‘safeguarding issues’ such as dealing with people who are mentally ill or vulnerable children in care. She said: ‘Crime is only a tiny part of what we do. Friday afternoon becomes very busy. Other services that are not 24-hour go down over the weekend – the police end up picking up.’ Inspector Michael Brown, of West Midlands Police, said his team was called to a residential home at least once a week to restrain patients, including one occasion when they went equipped with Tasers and riot gear. Writing in his Mental Health Cop blog, he said ‘earlier intervention’ would prevent police involvement in most cases. He added: ‘What we bring that others do not is batons and handcuffs; Tasers and CS spray – and arguably, that is all. ‘The legal powers we would have available to us are also equally available to others, the human ability to talk is not monopolised by the police.’ He was concerned there were ‘more and more’ incidences of police being called on to use force on passively resistant patients, adding that police were ‘sucked into the vacuum created’ by a lack of properly trained care staff. Sir Peter Fahy, Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police, said last year the problem had grown so large police were now an ‘extension of social services’. The equivalent of 400 officers in his force a year are taken away from traditional duties to deal with people who have mental health issues. A significant number of them are dementia patients. ‘We have seen a number of incidents where we feel our officers are called inappropriately to care homes and the wards of hospitals to try to restrain patients,’ Sir Peter said. Alistair Hunter, 58, (pictured with wife Frances) was restrained using ‘straps’ after becoming agitated . An Alzheimer's patient was restrained by police and ‘treated like a common criminal’, his wife claimed last night. Former IT consultant Alistair Hunter, 58, was restrained using ‘fast-straps’ after becoming agitated at Silverburn Care Home, near Glasgow. His wife Frances, 59, a local authority employee, said: ‘We’ve only ever had two parking tickets between us and yet in a vulnerable state he was restrained by police. It must have been so frightening for him. ‘The police aren’t dementia specialists so why are they being used to deal with people who have a medical condition? You put someone in a home believing they are able to cope.’ Mrs Hunter received a call from the home saying police had been called, but that her husband would not be charged ‘this time’. She said: ‘I couldn’t believe it. How could they consider charging a man who didn’t know what he was doing?’ 600,000 volunteer to become sufferers’ friends . Nearly 600,000 volunteers have signed up to a scheme to support dementia sufferers. The Dementia Friends campaign – backed by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt – is aimed at increasing understanding of the everyday difficulties faced by people with dementia and has trained businesses and individuals to recognise the condition. It was set up by Public Health England and the Alzheimer’s Society last year, with the backing of author Sir Terry Pratchett, 66, who was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer’s in 2007. It aimed to sign up one million people by May next year, with the hope that their understanding will make life easier for dementia patients. Businesses including Marks & Spencer, EDF Energy, easyJet, catering firm Compass Group and advertisers WPP have all signed up to train their staff under the scheme. Mr Hunt is expected to call for more businesses to get on board today when he speaks at a Confederation of British Industry event. By 2015, there will be 850,000 people with dementia living in the UK and this is expected to rise to one million in the next decade.","Police regularly being called to restrain dementia patients at care homes .

"NHS finance boss Paul Baumann (pictured) has warned the service is on a 'knife edge' The NHS is on a ‘knife edge’ and there may be ‘unexpected disasters', a senior boss has said. Paul Baumann, the health service’s finance chief, gave a stark warning after it emerged hospital waiting times are at their worst for six-and-a-half years. It came as a report revealed the number of hospitals needing emergency government bailouts has doubled in 12 months. The National Audit Office said 31 trusts had handouts last year, costing more than half a billion pounds. MPs and health experts said the situation was ‘deeply alarming’. Figures released yesterday show 3.2million patients are waiting for operations, scans and treatment – the most since April 2008. This includes 37,712 waiting for surgery longer than the Government target of 18 weeks – nearly double the number in May 2010. Mr Baumann told an NHS England meeting yesterday: ‘This feels as if it is the year we are on the knife edge.’ He said the health service ‘can’t guarantee against any unexpected disasters’. Officials would not say what these might be but they could include patients having to wait for hours on trolleys in A&E units this winter. Mr Baumann’s ‘knife edge’ comment is understood to refer to whether NHS England would meet financial targets. He is understood to have been explaining that meeting the financial targets are on a ‘knife edge’ and will depended on whether there are unexpected disasters such as a flu epidemic. Today’s report by the National Audit Office shows the number of hospitals needing Government bailouts rose from 17 in 2012/13 to 31 in 2013/14. Scroll down for video . Margaret Hodge MP, chairman of the influential Public Accounts Committee, said the report was ‘deeply alarming’, adding: ‘I do not believe it is any exaggeration to say that the future sustainability of our National Health Service is at risk. ‘Some trusts are only getting by on handouts. Things are getting worse … and we all know that when trusts are under this kind of financial stress it is the quality and safety of patient care that can suffer.’ A report has revealed the number of hospitals needing emergency government bailouts has doubled in 12 months . Last month health bosses warned the NHS would need an extra £8billion by 2020 to meet the demands of the aging population. NHS chief Simon Stevens said that without the money consequences for patients would be ‘severe’. The Patients’ Association’s Katherine Murphy said: ‘We receive many calls … about delays in treatment, incorrect diagnosis and undignified care. ‘We have known for many years that underfunding … has a direct impact on the quality of care … [and] on patient safety.’ North Cumbria University Hospitals received a £42million bailout, and Peterborough and Stamford Hospitals, Cambridgeshire, £41million. A Welsh cancer patient faces having to move to a caravan in England to get a drug that could prolong his life. Kidney cancer sufferer David Southwood, 53, of Newport, Gwent, used savings to buy Axitinib as the NHS in Wales will not pay for it. But he cannot afford to keep funding the treatment, and may have to live 50 miles away in a Somerset caravan, owned by his mother, to continue receiving it. David Southwood (pictured with wife Angela) used savings to buy Axitinib as the NHS in Wales will not pay for it . He faces having to move to a caravan (picured) in England to get the drug that could prolong his life . He said: ‘If I wait until December or January I probably won’t be here. It’s quite disturbing … I may lose the consultant I’ve had for the last two years. I have … no family at all in England so it would be isolating.’ Axitinib is free on the NHS in England via the Cancer Drugs Fund. But the Labour-run Welsh government has rejected calls to set up a similar fund. A spokesman said: ‘We are unable to comment on individual cases.’ Labour’s health spokesman Jamie Reed said: ‘NHS waiting lists are still heading in the wrong direction. People will be alarmed to hear NHS bosses talking about possible imminent disasters.’ - Meanwhile, the NHS could save £2billion a year by introducing appointments via video link, prescribing cheaper drugs and cutting needless X-rays, senior doctors said. The Academy of Royal Medical Colleges highlighted 16 areas where spending could be cut including lower-cost statins, which would save £85million a year.","Senior boss: NHS on a 'knife edge' which may lead to 'unexpected disasters'

"Cancer survival rates in England are lagging behind other developed countries because not enough patients get crucial tests which could diagnose the disease early, the chief inspector of hospitals said yesterday. Professor Sir Mike Richards revealed England performs nearly half as many colonoscopies - a test for bowel cancer - as Poland. Australia and Canada, two of the best performing countries internationally for colorectal cancers, give the test to around three times as many patients per 1,000 people as England. Poor survival rates could be down to the low numbers of testing for cancer among patients in the UK, a leading doctor said (file image) Sir Mike, the government’s former national cancer director, said Wales performed the fewest tests per head in the UK, while the West Midlands was the worst area in England and the North East the best. Scottish patients were 50 per cent more likely on average to receive the test than the English, but he described this as ‘not something to be terribly proud of’ as it still performed slightly fewer than Poland. Speaking at the National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) conference in Liverpool, he said: ‘One of the reasons (the UK has lower survival rates than other developed countries) probably is that we don’t do enough diagnostics. ‘There may be overuse of diagnostics in some of these countries, but it’s important we benchmark ourselves to see where we are.’ He added: ‘I would say the UK woke up late to the problem of cancer. Good progress has been made, particularly since 2000, but we are still not achieving outcomes comparable with the best countries and, if you want to put that even more simply: could do better.’ Sir Mike cited the differences in care standards across British Hospital and named Wexham Park Hospital in Surrey which was rated poor in most areas when assessed . Britain needs ‘better cancer prevention, better earlier diagnosis and more testing of the general public’, he said. But problems with getting tests for early diagnosis were not due to ‘a lack of will’ on the part of GPs but linked to funding restraints. Sir Mike also said the Care Quality Commission had discovered ‘huge variation’ between standards of care in hospitals. He gave the example of Frimley Park Hospital, in Surrey, which was rated good or outstanding on almost every assessment area, and Wexham Park Hospital, just 24 miles away, which was rated poor or needing improvement in most areas. But he implied patients should not complain about having to travel to get the best treatment. He told the conference that if he had cancer he ‘would want to be treated close to home and at my convenience, but I wouldn’t want that to the exclusion of getting the best treatment’. He added: ‘It always amazes me that people are prepared to fly 1,000 miles for a better chance of sunshine on a summer holiday, but they seem to think it’s to far to go, to go 50 miles to get the best cancer treatment... I would travel if I had to.’ Survival rate‎s for colorectal cancer in the UK improved from 70 per cent of patients living for at least one year to just under 75 per cent between 1995 and 2007, according to the Lancet. In contrast, the same figures showed ‎survival rates in Australia were 85 per cent and were 83 per cent in Canada. Nearly half of patients diagnosed with lung cancer on emergency admission to hospital had been put off going to see their GP, a study presented at the conference found. Reasons included difficulty making an appointment, being unable to see their usual doctor, not having confidence in their GP and fear of what a doctor would say. The research, by the London Cancer Alliance and King’s College London, found three quarters had see a GP about their symptoms before being admitted, with a third visiting three times. Around a quarter had been referred to hospital for tests but were hospitalised before the appointment as their condition deteriorated. Dr Robert Rintoul, chair of NCRI’s lung clinical studies group, said: ‘If lung cancer is diagnosed at an early stage, patients have a much higher chance of surviving the disease. 'Therefore it’s vital that patients recognise possible symptoms early on and are able to get them checked out quickly.’","England performs  half as many colonoscopies as Poland for bowel cancer .

"She is now a happy, smiling nine-year-old who is doing well at school and loves messing about with her three brothers. But just a few months ago, Daisy Ames was in agony, struggling to cope with her severe allergies. She had painful eczema all over her body, which caused weeping sores on her face and legs and stopped her sleeping at night. Now her life has been turned around thanks to an unusual treatment – a special anti-allergy washing machine. Daisy has been pain-free since her family received the Servis Sensitive Wash machine, which strips clothes of bacteria and allergens such as residual soap powder to stop them irritating her skin . The Servis Sensitive Wash machine was given to Daisy’s parents, Laura and Russell, through charity Allergy UK in June. It has helped to stop her clothes irritating her skin by stripping them of bacteria and allergens such as residual soap powder. Daisy has suffered with eczema since she was a baby but was only diagnosed with allergies to dust mites and mould spores, as well as dairy, wheat and peanuts, when she was seven years old. She had treatment from specialists at St Mary’s Hospital in London, after being referred by doctors from her home in Hythe, Kent. Teacher Mrs Ames, 37, said: ‘She has had quite severe eczema since she was a baby. At its worst she was missing a lot of school as she was so uncomfortable. She had big sores on her legs and on her face and was coming out in rashes. ‘She was really unwell. It meant she was sad and quiet – she was not a happy little child.’ Mrs Ames said that the combination of the donated washing machine – which at £399 cost more than the family would have been able to afford – and help from the allergy specialists had ‘all worked together to bring about a change’. She added: ‘It has helped her be more comfortable. She is now very happy and well in herself.’ Before, eczema left Daisy Ames's kin covered in weeping sores and at its worst she was missing school . The washing machine removes allergens, bacteria and stains left by creams and emollients from clothes in a three-hour wash at 60 degrees, with four rinse cycles. It holds an 8kg load and uses less water and electricity than many ordinary machines – while spinning clothes at a range of slow and fast speeds allowing more bacteria to be removed. Machines were donated by Servis to three families after being approved by Allergy UK. Lindsey McManus, deputy chief executive of the charity, said: ‘Allergen avoidance is a key step in managing allergic conditions. ‘Products such as the Servis washing machine that have been endorsed with the Allergy UK seal of approval have undergone rigorous scientific testing, to ensure that they actually remove allergens and bacteria in the washing cycle.’","Just a few months ago, Daisy Ames, was in agony with severe allergies .

"They were an aspirational family who believed in hard work, the importance of education and good manners. In their middle-class suburban neighbourhood Jitendra Lad, 49, his wife Daksha, 44, and their two teenage daughters were regarded as ‘the nicest family in the world’. But yesterday police were investigating the mysterious deaths of all four members of this seemingly loving family. Scroll down for video . Investigation: MailOnline understands Jitendra Lad, 49, centre, may have killed his wife Daksha, 44, centre right, and their two children, Trisha, 19, left, and Nisha, 16, right, before hanging himself . Police probe: West Yorkshire Police confirmed they have launched a murder investigation after the family was found dead at home in the Clayton area of Bradford (pictured) Investigation: Police forensic teams arrived at the house this morning to gather evidence, but they are not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths . In mourning: Tearful friends of the dead teenagers gathered at the home today to pay their respects . Detectives believe that Mr Lad may have murdered his wife and daughters Trisha, 19, and Nisha, 16, before killing himself. The family had not been seen for several days when a neighbour gained access to their £250,000 detached house and found the horrific scene on Monday evening. Police and ambulance were called to the quiet cul-de-sac at 8.30pm. Mrs Lad and her daughters were dead in one room and Mr Lad was found hanging in another. Friends and neighbours were unaware of any problems in the family and had heard no arguments. Both parents had good jobs as clerical officers with the local council and were keen to climb the career ladder. Trisha was in her second year at Leeds University studying for a degree in biochemistry and Nisha was at sixth form. Suspect: Jitendra Lad, left, was named by police as the man that died in a house in Bradford along with his wife Daksha, right . Sisters: Nisha Lad (right) with older sister Trisha, who were both described as bubbly by friends today . Lock down: Police have launched a murder investigation and sealed off the house but believe that the killer came from within the family . Probe: Detective Superintendent Simon Atkinson at a press conference outside the crime scene, would not speculate on how the family died but admitted it was a murder inquiry . Tributes: Shocked and emotional Bradford residents arrive at the house to lay flowers in memory of the family . Disbelief: Neighbours described the family as 'perfect' and said they had been celebrating Diwali in recent days . Upset: Neighbours and friends of the family have been visiting the home, with some laying flowers . Forensic officers yesterday scoured the house in Clayton, Bradford, as detectives began researching the family for a motive to the horrific murder. Post-mortems were due to be carried out today to discover how Mrs Lad and her daughters died, but their deaths were being treated as ‘murder’. Police said they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident. The parents and Nisha were seen heading to work and school as normal at around 7.30am on Friday, saying their usual cheerful hello to the newspaper delivery man. However, police said the bodies ‘may have been in the property for some time’ and neighbours could not recall seeing the family over the weekend. Mr Lad and his wife married in Bradford 23 years ago. The Hindu couple worked at Bradford Council, Mr Lad in revenue and benefits while his wife was an administrator. Shop manager Niraj Patel, 49, a friend of Mr Lad, said he was stunned to be told he may have murdered his family. ‘He was a very happy, easy-going chap, always a smile on his face,’ he said. ‘I’m totally shocked. You’d never believe he would have an ounce of violence in him.’ Susan Hawkins, 34, a support worker, said: ‘They were the nicest family in the world and the last family you would ever expect this to happen to. I used to see the mum in the playground when the kids were younger and she had a gorgeous smile, she was a real doting mum.’ Mr Lad’s parents were being supported by family at their home less than half a mile from the scene yesterday. A relative, who did not want to be named, said: ‘They are very, very shocked. They don’t know what exactly has happened, they are waiting for the police to tell them.’ Neighbours at the family’s previous address in Clayton, where they lived for 14 years, said the couple sold up to move to a better area and a better home. One said: ‘You could call them aspirational. She wanted to be head of planning or something like that.’ Jessica Garside, 18, who used to catch the bus to school with the girls, said: ‘Trisha was really clever and always had a nice word to say about people.’ Couple: A friend said that Mr and Mrs Lad were inseparable and even worked at the same council as clerical staff . Much loved: Friends said today Nisha and Trisha, left and right, they were bereft after their deaths . Crime scene: Sources say that the deaths are linked to the father of the house, who then killed himself . Upset: Neighbours said today there were no clues that a tragedy like this would engulf a 'lovely' family . Chris Sampson, the headmaster at Thornton Grammar School, where Nisha Lad and her sister Trisha both studied, said: 'We are deeply shocked and saddened by these tragic deaths.

"A girl of nine has been left heartbroken after her pony died from eating sycamore tree seeds. Eva Machan thought the animal, Painted Paula, would be safe grazing in her field. But she deteriorated rapidly after eating the seeds last week and had to be put down. Eva’s mother Juliet, 44, has warned other horse owners to be alert to the problem. The seeds are often called helicopter seeds because of the way they spiral down from the trees in the autumn. Eva Machan's horse Painted Paula, or PP for short, died after eating seeds which can cause organ failure and muscle weakness in horses . They contain a toxin called hypoglycin A. Horses eating them can develop atypical myopathy, a condition which causes muscle weakness and organ failure. It is fatal in four out of five cases. Eva, from Henley-on-Thames, had had her pet, known affectionately as PP, since May and she and her five-year-old sister Zara rode her nearly every day. She loved caring for the pony, mucking out her stables and feeding her grass and oats. Mrs Machan said Eva, who goes to the Abbey School in Reading, has been devastated and ‘very tearful’ over the animal’s death. Mrs Machan noticed something was wrong when they took the chestnut-and-white pony to a gymkhana at Addington, near Bicester. She said: ‘She was a bit sluggish. About half an hour later she literally just stopped walking – she stopped dead and wouldn’t move.’ Vets assumed PP had cramps and treated her with muscle relaxants and pain relief. But within a few days she deteriorated so much she had to be put down. Sycamore tree seeds, or helicopter seeds, are fatal in four out of five cases when eaten by horses but are not thought to be harmful to humans (file picture) Mrs Machan said: ‘The final test showed kidney failure. It was a horrible and completely unexpected experience and we need to avoid this happening to other horses.’ The family have now moved their other pony, Polo, away while two nearby sycamore trees are felled. Mrs Machan added: ‘It is no-one’s fault. We hope that by people reading this we may help prevent other animals suffering unnecessarily.’ There have been a number of reports of horses dying from the condition in the past few weeks as autumn takes hold and the seeds drop and scatter. Sycamore seeds are not thought to be harmful to humans but can cause vomiting in dogs.","Eva Machan, nine, was left heartbroken after her horse, Painted Paula, died .

"Multi-millionaire Alex Langsam is putting up hundreds of migrants in his chain of 47 hotels . This is the multi-millionaire cashing in on a Home Office decision to use one of the country’s largest privately owned hotel chains to house asylum seekers. In a deal costing the taxpayer tens of thousands of pounds a week, Alex Langsam is putting up hundreds of migrants in his chain of 47 hotels. His firm, Britannia Hotels, owns the three properties in Folkestone and Bournemouth that were recently found to be providing ‘full board’ accommodation for hundreds of taxpayer-funded asylum seekers. Now the Daily Mail has learned that another of 76-year-old Mr Langsam’s hotels – four miles from Gatwick airport – is housing 100 asylum seekers. Many are from Eritrea and Somalia with others from Arab states or Eastern Europe. Paying guests – who were using the 130-bedroom Russ Hill Hotel near the Surrey village of Charlwood as a ‘stay and fly’ hotel – were stunned to find the group staying for free alongside them. One guest, who was paying £50 for a pre-flight stay and then £6 a day to park her car in the hotel grounds, said: ‘It is more like a hostel than a hotel – I will never stay here again after this experience.’ As she spoke more than 70 asylum seekers sat on chairs and on the floor in the reception area and lounge – while others went for walks in the sprawling grounds. Eritrean-born Saddiq said he had been in Britain for only a few weeks and was moved to the hotel from another Britannia property – thought to be in Bournemouth. ‘I am grateful to the Home Office for paying for my room,’ he said. ‘We get fed at the hotel and it is good to be here but the rooms are not so big. Some people have to share.’ While the arrangement has clearly come as a surprise to paying guests, it appears to be providing a lucrative income for Mr Langsam, the founder, owner and chief executive of Britannia. He is said to have amassed a personal fortune of £70million and lives in a ten-bedroomed former hotel worth more than £3million in a leafy Cheshire village close to his headquarters. It is near a property once owned by former Manchester United footballer Roy Keane. Mr Langsam’s home is surrounded by carefully-kept gardens featuring marble statues. His two Jaguar cars and a Bentley sit on the driveway. Enjoying a country walk: Asylum seekers pictured at the Russ Hill Hotel, near Gatwick . He also has a £400,000 leasehold flat in Didsbury, Manchester. Business is booming for Britannia despite the fact that some of the group’s hotels have been described as dirty on the TripAdvisor website, where guests post comments about hotels where they have stayed. His hotel group’s latest figures showed an increased turnover of 25 per cent to almost £70million – with profits of nearly £12million posted last year. Last year the company was fined £160,000 after exposing guests and construction workers to a risk from asbestos found in the Grand Burstin hotel in Folkestone. It admitted breaching safety regulations during conversion work in 2010. The Home Office is thought to be paying around £350 per week for each asylum seeker placed in Britannia’s hotels. Mr Langsam's business is booming  despite the fact that some of his group’s hotels have been described as dirty on the TripAdvisor website . Mr Langsam has expanded the budget hotel chain. It now has 47 hotels offering 9,000 rooms, and three years ago he bought the Pontins holiday camp business. In 2011/2012 the Home Office spent £150million providing accommodation for asylum seekers. The figure is now likely to nudge £200million. Judging by reviews posted on TripAdvisor, Britannia is not advertising to paying guests that it houses asylum seekers at the Russ Hill Hotel, near Gatwick. One reviewer wrote: ‘We did not expect that the hotel would be full of people who are on a very extended stay and get all of their meals and £10 a day spending money as well!’ The Grand Burstin Hotel, which has views of the White Cliffs of Folkestone, is housing newly arrived asylum claimants . The Heathlands Hotel, in Bournemouth, where 67 asylum seekers are currently being put up at the taxpayer's expense . Many residents in the village of Charlwood are equally unimpressed with their new neighbours. One woman, who lives yards from the hotel, said: ‘Last weekend we had a large number of men sitting on the verge outside our house and staring at us and our home. It really was quite intimidating.’ Last month the Daily Mail told how the Home Office bussed coachloads of asylum seekers to the three-star Britannia Roundhouse Hotel in Bournemouth where 88 were billeted. It then emerged that a further 67 were booked into the Britannia-owned Heathlands Hotel, which is also in Bournemouth, while 130 were at the Grand Burstin Hotel in Folkestone. Earlier in the month hotel inspectors found 600 asylum seekers crammed into the 98-room Queen’s Hotel in Crystal Palace, South London, with nine people sharing one room. It is not owned by Britannia, but many of the asylum seekers were later moved to Bournemouth and Folkestone. It is unclear how many more of Britannia’s 47 hotels are being used for asylum seekers. Last night neither Britannia Hotels nor Mr Langsam was available for comment. The Home Office refused to confirm details of its contract with the company.

"It was supposed to be a girls’ night in, with two young mothers watching television and enjoying a drink. But the evening spiralled out of control when Jessica Ward and Molly Couch binged on three bottles of wine and ended up brawling in the street. The fight began after they locked themselves out – leaving their two baby daughters alone inside. Friends Molly Couch (left) and Jessica Ward (right) had drunk three bottles of wine before leaving their children . Police were called to the house of 22-year-old Ward and found her and Couch, 21, drunkenly blaming each other, swearing and throwing their arms around. Fire crews got into the house through a first-floor window to rescue the children, aged just 18 months and 17 months. The mothers, from Fleetwood, Lancashire, were said to be ‘reeking’ of alcohol and were around three times the drink-drive limit. Care assistant Ward and Couch, a former football club promotions officer, were arrested and given suspended jail sentences after admitting child neglect. Blackpool magistrates’ court, dealing with the cases separately, heard Couch had brought her baby to Ward’s home on September 17 so the women could watch television and share some wine. But they had three bottles between them before deciding to fetch some shoes from Couch’s house at 11pm, leaving the babies in their cots. Molly Couch (left) and Jessica Ward (right) arrive at Blackpool Magistrates' Court and admitted child neglect . When they discovered they were locked out they called their parents who alerted police and fire crews at 11.40pm – but blamed each other for the blunder. Chrissie Hunt, prosecuting, said: ‘These defendants were fighting with one another in the street. Both parties said they had been drinking and were locked out and two young children were alone inside. Both defendants were verbally abusive to one another. ‘One child could be heard crying. The defendants were in no fit state to be caring for the children.’ In police interviews the pair admitted they had gone out knowing there was no babysitter. The court heard Ward had previously been cautioned by police when her child was three months, over a drunken argument with her then boyfriend. Her lawyer Paul Robinson said Ward ‘doesn’t know when to stop’ when drinking and had sought counselling for the problem. Jessica Ward was sentenced to 26 weeks in prison suspended for 18 months for leaving her daughter alone . Representing Couch, Alan Goodwin said: ‘It was a stupid error. She has accepted that she put her child in danger. ‘We are talking about 30 minutes … The child has not suffered.’ District Judge Jeff Brailsford told Ward: ‘I don’t understand what you thought you were doing. The greatest gift in this world is a child … . Molly Couch, 21, was sentenced to 12 weeks in prison suspended for a year with 12 month supervision order . Jessica Ward, pictured in one of a number of 'selfies' admitted she drinks to excess and is having treatment . The judge told Molly Couch, 21, she had got it 'badly wrong' when she left her daughter alone in the house . Close friends Couch (left) and Ward (right) had to be separated by police after they were brawling in the street . ‘This is one of the worst cases of letting a child down … The obligations, duties and responsibilities of caring for a child are huge, not to be put to one side because you fancied a drink.’ He told Couch: ‘You were not in a fit state to look after the baby … You got it very badly wrong, you put your child at risk.’ Ward was given a 26-week jail term suspended for 18 months, an 18-month supervision order and 16 weeks wearing an electronic tag. Couch was sentenced to 12 weeks in prison suspended for a year, with a 12-month supervision order and six months of alcohol treatment.

"Patients are increasingly turning to the internet to self-diagnose their health problems as they struggle to get an appointment with a GP. The number of visitors to NHS Choices, the Government’s health website, jumped by 40 per cent compared to last year and nearly 160 per cent since 2012, data released today reveals. And two thirds of visits were to pages about the diagnosis and treatment of conditions. The most popular topics were pregnancy and baby health, viewed 29.5million times so far this year. File image . The most popular topics were pregnancy and baby health, viewed 29.5million times so far this year. Other common searches were about mental health, stomach ache, chicken pox and back pain, according to the Health and Social Care Information Centre, which runs the website. Campaigners said patients are turning to the internet because it is increasingly difficult to get a GP appointment or to see the same GP to get consistent advice about a chronic condition. Roger Goss, of Patient Concern, said the situation was ‘terrible’. Earlier this year, the Royal College of GPs warned of a ‘crisis’ as surgeries struggle to cope with a growing and ageing population. Campaigners said patients are turning to the internet because it is increasingly difficult to get a GP appointment or to see the same GP to get consistent advice about a chronic condition.

"Sunshine could be key to stopping prostate cancer growing, a study has found. Scientists found Vitamin D, which is produced when the skin is exposed to sunlight, boosted a gene which can block a chemical known to encourage tumour growth. Vitamin D increases the effectiveness of the gene GDF-15, which researchers at the University of Colorado, in Denver, found suppressed inflammation in cancerous prostate tissue. Inflammation is a driving factor behind the growth of tumours in several cancers including prostate, gastric and colon. Scientists have found Vitamin D - produced when the skin is exposed to sunlight - boosts a gene that blocks tumour growth . The study used a sophisticated computer algorithm to analyse samples of prostate cells and compare the prevalence of the GDF-15 protein and inflammatory cells. The research, published in the journal Prostate, found the GDF-15 gene blocked NFkB – a protein complex which triggers inflammation and promotes the formation and growth of tumours. Although scientists already knew that NFkB could worsen cancer, they had not come up with a solution to stop it. This latest research suggests that using Vitamin D to stimulate the GDF-15 gene could be a possible future technique for controlling prostate cancer. James Lambert, investigator at the University of Colorado Cancer Center, said: ‘When you take Vitamin D and put it on prostate cancer cells, it inhibits their growth. But it hasn’t been proven as an anti-cancer agent. We wanted to understand what genes Vitamin D is turning on or off in prostate cancer to offer new targets. ‘Inflammation is thought to drive many cancers. Therefore, GDF-15 may be a good thing in keeping prostate tissue healthy – it suppresses inflammation, which is a bad actor potentially driving prostate cancer. ‘There’s been a lot of work on inhibiting NFkB. Now from this starting point of Vitamin D in prostate cancer, we’ve come a long way toward understanding how we might use GDF-15 to target NFkB, which may have implications in cancer types far beyond prostate.’","Vitamin D can help to block chemical known to encourage tumour growth .

"Mollycoddling teenagers can have a damaging impact on their relationships in adolescence and early adulthood, researchers found. A study showed teenagers whose parents kept tight control over them struggled to form relationships without losing independence and were more likely to bow to peer pressure. The University of Virginia study, in journal Child Development, followed nearly 200 youngsters aged 13 to 21. What are you reading? A study found mollycoddled teens found relationships more difficult (posed by model) It found 13-year-olds whose parents used emotional tactics such as guilt to control them were less able to keep balanced relationships at 18 and 21. The more psychological control teenagers had from their parents, the worse they got throughout their adolescence at establishing autonomy and closeness in their relationships, researchers found. The level of control could also predict the success of their future relationships, as the better their ability to be close to romantic partners yet maintain their own confidence and identity was at 18, the better it was at 21. Lead researcher Barbara Oudekerk said parents who used guilt, withdrawing love or emotional manipulation to control their teenage children were more likely to pressure them to make decisions in line with the parents’ wishes rather than their own. Get off my case! Parents keep a watchful eye on their offspring, and it's seldom appreciated (posed by models) She added: ‘Without opportunities to practice self-directed, independent decision making, teens might give in to their friends’ and partners’ decisions. ‘Parents often fear the harmful consequences of peer pressure in adolescence. Our study suggests that parents can promote or undermine teens’ ability to assert their own views and needs to close friends and romantic partners. ‘In addition, teens who learn - or fail to learn - how to express independence and closeness with friends and partners during adolescence carry these skills forward into adult relationships.'","Study at University of Virginia followed nearly 200 teens for eight years .

"The number of children with vitamin D deficiency has soared by more than 200 per cent in five years because parents are unaware how important it is for health, a study has revealed. It also exposed a ‘worrying’ lack of knowledge by GPs and health workers about the Government’s guidelines on the vitamin. Now the public health awareness campaign which commissioned the study is warning parents must give their children supplements and fortified foods to avoid a return to ‘Victorian’ levels of vitamin D deficiency, when the bone-softening disease rickets was common. Scroll down for video . Foods such as oily fish (including salmon), eggs and mushrooms naturally contain vitamin D . Vitamin D Mission said supplements were particularly important during winter months when sunlight is not strong enough to enable skin to produce the vitamin. Foods such as oily fish, eggs and mushrooms naturally contain vitamin D, but many cereals and some dairy products are fortified with the vitamin. Skin exposure to sunlight from March to October also produces vitamin D. The survey of more than 1,100 parents and 250 health professionals found only 4 per cent of parents with children under five knew that sunlight in the UK between November and March could not provide vitamin D. Worryingly, only 7 per cent of GPs and health visitors surveyed could name the months when sunlight was too weak to produce it. And a third of health professionals and four in five parents were unaware of government guidelines that children aged from six months to five years old should take a daily vitamin D supplement. Half of parents admitted knowing ‘not much’ or ‘nothing’ about the role of the vitamin in their child’s health, while more than a third said they had never received any information about its importance in relation to their child. Survey found half of parents knew ‘not much’ or ‘nothing’ about the role of the vitamin in their children’s health . The Vitamin D Mission also gathered hospital data on admissions for vitamin D deficiency and rickets, which is caused by a lack of the vitamin, and found cases in under-16s have jumped from 1,398 in 2009/10 to 4,638 in 2013/14. The east Midlands saw the biggest jump in cases – with a 628 per cent increase since 2009/10 - while the south west saw the smallest increase at 3 per cent. London and the south east both had increases of more than 300 per cent. Dr Benjamin Jacobs, consultant paediatrician at The Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital and clinical consultant to the Vitamin D Mission, said: ‘These findings are very worrying as they seem to suggest that parents in the UK are still not properly informed of the major health issues associated with low levels of vitamin D. ‘Vitamin D-related conditions, such as rickets, are increasing year on year so there is a need for us to work harder in ensuring parents are aware of the Department of Health guidelines and acting on it. ‘Due to the weak sunlight during the winter months, we are urging parents to make every day a vitamin D day, and include naturally occurring or fortified vitamin D-rich foods into their children’s diets, or to provide them with a daily supplement.’ GP Dr Ellie Cannon said the average British toddler only received around 27 per cent of the recommended vitamin D intake. She added: ‘Much more work needs to be done around increasing awareness among parents and healthcare professionals. ‘In addition, parents can make a few simple adjustments to their children’s diet such as including more naturally-rich and enhanced vitamin D foods.’ An online test for parents to see if their children under five are getting enough is available at: www.vitamindmission.co.uk.","Worrying lack of knowledge by GPs and health workers on guidelines: study .

"Sales of caffeine and sugar-packed energy drinks should be restricted as they ‘pose a danger’ to children and young people, a study has suggested. More than two thirds of 10 to 18-year-olds consume drinks like Red Bull and Monster and their popularity is growing, research by the World Health Organisation’s Regional Office for Europe found. But the study warned children and teenagers who used highly-caffeinated drinks were at risk of ‘potentially harmful adverse and developmental effects’. Lead author Dr Joao Breda called for restrictions to be put in place to limit the sale of energy drinks to children. Scroll down for video . A study by the World Health Organisation has warned children and teenagers who drink sugar and caffeine-laden energy drinks are at risk of 'potentially harmful adverse and developmental effects' (file picture) He also recommended limiting the total amount of caffeine allowed in a single can or bottle and criticised ‘aggressive marketing’ of the drinks towards young people. The study, which examined existing research, said: ‘The full impact of the rise in popularity of energy drinks has not yet been quantified, but the aggressive marketing of energy drinks targeted at young people combined with limited and varied regulation have created an environment where energy drinks could pose a significant threat to public health.’ It added: ‘As energy drink sales are rarely regulated by age and there is a proven negative effect of caffeine on children, there is the potential for a significant public health problem in future.’ Large amounts of caffeine can cause heart palpitations, fits and even death, as well as raising the risk of Type 2 diabetes. Heavy consumption has also been linked to a greater risk of depression, addiction and alcohol dependency. More than two thirds of 10 to 18-year-olds consume drinks like Red Bull and Monster, the study found . Energy drinks could be more likely to cause a caffeine overdose because they can be drunk quickly, unlike hot drinks like tea or coffee, the Energy Drink Consumption in Europe study said. More than seven in 10 young people who drink energy drinks mix them with alcohol but this is particularly dangerous because the energising effect means drinkers are unaware of how drunk they are getting. Studies have shown people who mix the drinks are more likely to drink-drive, fight and take sexual risks. Several deaths worldwide have been linked to excessive consumption of energy drinks, although scientists say more research is needed to prove a link. Gavin Partington, director general of the British Soft Drinks Association, said the study did not take ‘into account the conclusions of other scientific articles’. He added: ‘Several of the policy recommendations it makes are already well established through the BSDA’s voluntary code and EU regulation.’ Recommended maximum caffeine intake is about 400mg per day – equivalent to around five cups of filter coffee. A standard 250ml can of Red Bull contains 80mg of caffeine and 27.5g of sugar (nearly seven teaspoons), while a 500ml can of Monster contains 160mg of caffeine and 55g – or nearly 14 teaspoons - of sugar. Some European countries like Denmark and Turkey have total bans on energy drinks, while others like Sweden have restrictions on sales to under-15s. They are banned from many schools in Britain and some retailers have their own policies on sales to under-16s, but there is no law preventing their sale to children. Last year, 19-year-old rugby player Joshua Merrick, from Manchester, who regularly drank a high-energy drink called Animal Rage before working out, was found dead. A doctor who conducted tests on his body did not rule out the possibility they could have contributed to his death, but said the teenager also had an enlarged heart. His death was recorded as being from natural causes.","More than two thirds of 10 to 18-year-olds drink Red Bull and Monster .

"It was probably not the best moment for Nigel Farage to discuss Ukip’s problem attracting the female vote. Posing on a tank after downing three pints of beer yesterday, he admitted his party’s ‘blokeish’ image may put women off. Digging himself deeper into a hole, he asked: ‘What do you want me to do? Go sell flowers?’ Ukip's Nigel Farage posed on a Chieftain mk 10 battle tank at the Heywood Tank Museum, as he campaigned in the Heywood by-election . He hopes Ukip candidate John Bickley can defy the odds and overturn a Labour majority of almost 6,000 . Mr Farage also inspected the inside of an armoured personnel carrier during his visit to the museum . The Ukip leader was campaigning in Heywood and Middleton ahead of tomorrow’s by-election. His party’s candidate in the Labour stronghold near Manchester is attracting only half as many votes from women as from men. A poll showed that if only men were voting, Ukip would win the by-election, triggered by the death of Labour MP Jim Dobbin. Some 41 per cent of men said they would vote Ukip, compared with 38 per cent for Labour. In contrast, only 21 per cent of women said they would vote Ukip, compared with 58 per cent for Labour. Labour is predicted to retain the seat it won in 2010 with a 6,000 majority. But Ukip is expected to come a close second and Mr Farage posed on the Chieftain Mk10 owned by one of his supporters to demonstrate his claim that the party has its tanks on Labour’s lawn. Ukip has faced claims of sexism, particularly after one of its MEPs said last year that a group of female activists were ‘sluts’. Mr Farage had at first denied yesterday that his party had ‘a women problem’. But he added: ‘I am not going to pretend to reach out to female voters or voters of all different denominations. During his campaigning, Mr Farage made his now traditional visit to a local pub, The Gardeners Arms . Ukip have stepped up their attacks on Labour in an attempt to prove they are not just able to take votes from the Tories . ‘The problem with female voters and Ukip is that, over the last five to ten years, at times, on a very bad day, we’ve looked a bit blokeish, a bit like a rugby club on a day out and I’m probably the most guilty person of all.’ He insisted there had been a ‘sea change’ in 2014 which had seen a boom in women candidates and senior party figures. Ukip is expected to win tomorrow’s other by-election, in Clacton, sparked by the defection of Tory MP Douglas Carswell. Embarrassingly for the Conservatives, London mayor Boris Johnson yesterday forgot the name of his party’s candidate in the Essex seat, former Bread actor Giles Watling. Last night it emerged that Mr Farage has been elected unopposed as Ukip leader for another four years. But that means that if he does not win a seat in next May’s general election and Mr Carswell holds Clacton, it would lead to an uncomfortable situation where the party’s leader is outside the Commons even though it has an MP inside.","Ukip leader climbs on to Chieftain mk 10 battle tank to pose for cameras .

"Subtle changes in the way someone walks could be an early sign of dementia, a study has found. Scientists at Newcastle University have discovered a link between changes in the gait of people with Parkinson’s disease and their cognitive function. It could mean a person’s walk could be studied by doctors for warning signs dementia is developing – so treatment can be started earlier and symptoms managed better. Scroll down for video . The intensive study followed 120 patients who had been recently diagnosed with Parkinson's (file photo) The study, published in Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience, followed 120 patients who had recently been diagnosed with Parkinson’s and compared them with a control group of healthy elderly people. People with Parkinson’s are six times more likely to develop dementia than healthy people of the same age and this study is the biggest of its kind to look at patients in the early stages of the disease. Participants walked around a 25-metre circuit for two minutes while their walking style was analysed by computers which can measure tiny changes undetectable to the eye. They were also tested on their cognitive function. The researchers found a ‘strong’ relationship between both a person’s pace and their attention levels and their postural control and their working memory. They intend to follow the subjects further to see how this link develops as they age. Lynn Rochester, professor of Human Movement Science at Newcastle University and lead author of the paper, said: ‘Subtle changes in someone’s walking pattern, for example slowing down of steps and increased sway from side to side, are related to cognitive function even before changes are seen in cognitive tests. ‘Ongoing work will confirm if it is possible to predict future cognitive decline and dementia risk. However this early work shows great promise. 'If we can use this and test people who may at risk, then we could pick up the early signs and begin treatment and advice.’ Dr Beckie Port, of charity Parkinson’s UK, said: ‘This research provides crucial insights into subtle changes in walking that could help us identify people with Parkinson’s who are at risk of developing dementia and problems with thinking and memory at a much earlier stage. ‘This means people at risk can be monitored closely and receive treatments earlier.’","Say if disease diagnosed, treatment can start earlier and be managed better .

"Ed Miliband was last night forced to publicly deny that Labour’s chances of winning the general election would be boosted if he was replaced by Alan Johnson. The Labour leader, who is facing a revolt over his ‘complacent’ strategy for winning power, dismissed suggestions that health spokesman Andy Burnham was also plotting to succeed him. Both Mr Johnson, 64, and Mr Burnham, who ran in the last Labour leadership campaign, have been touted as potential replacements. There were claims last night that Mr Johnson would take the top job if it was offered in a ‘coronation’ rather than a contested election. Alan Johnson (left), has been touted as a possible replacement for incumbent Labour leader Ed Miliband (right) The charismatic former home secretary insisted his answer to those urging him to make a leadership bid was: ‘No, no, no, no, no.’ Asked if Labour’s chances of success would be improved if he went, an irritated Mr Miliband answered: ‘I don’t. I think that I’m the right person to be doing this job. ‘What I’m clear about is that we have a plan. We have a plan for the future of this country and these questions don’t arise.’ Labour nerves have been jangled by three polls suggesting the Tories have moved ahead after Mr Miliband’s disastrous party conference speech, in which he forgot to mention the budget deficit. David Cameron, meanwhile, has opened up a staggering 42-point lead over Mr Miliband on the question of leadership. There is growing unrest over the Labour leader’s alleged plan to secure victory by winning around 35 per cent of the vote – core Labour supporters plus disaffected Liberal Democrats. A poll set alarm bells ringing this week by suggesting a sharp fall in the number of Lib Dems switching to Labour. The Labour leader is said to be preparing to shake up his top team within the next few weeks as he seeks to steady the ship. Former cabinet minister and 'ultra' Blairite Lord Adonis (pictured) has been tipped for a comeback . Former Cabinet minister Lord Adonis, an ‘ultra’ Blairite who masterminded the academies programme, is tipped for a comeback. UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage said that if his party clinched victory in a by-election in the safe Labour seat of Heywood and Middleton tomorrow, ‘Ed Miliband will be gone by Christmas’. He refused to endorse another Labour politician to replace Mr Miliband, but said: ‘Alan Johnson at least has the advantage of talking like a human being.’ Mr Miliband is also under pressure to make a strong attempt to deliver a Labour victory in another by- election in Rochester, Kent, amid signs the party plans to sit back as the Tories and Ukip slug it out. Former defence minister Lord Moonie said his party needed to do more to reflect the concerns of ordinary voters: ‘The concerns of voters in Rochester should be ours too, if we wish to win our targets. Poverty of aspiration has never to my knowledge been a winning strategy. ‘We must inspire people. As a confirmed anti-EU campaigner, I believe for a start we should be offering a referendum on in/out. We must also address legitimate concerns of our working-class core support on migration and jobs.’ John Mann, Labour MP for Bassetlaw, called for a significant reshuffle – accusing his party of becoming too metropolitan. ‘This problem is well beyond Ed Miliband,’ he said. ‘He’s got to shake up the pack, it’s fundamental – he’s got to change the attitude at the top. There’s too much Mr Nice Guy – he’s not prepared to tackle the difficult issues such as immigration. ‘People at the top of the Labour Party need to listen to concerns over immigration and over people’s feeling of being disenfranchised in England. What I want is Ed Miliband to listen to the concerns of people like me and voters I represent. ‘In order to win he needs a bigger dose of Northern realism.’ Labour’s former Scottish leader Henry McLeish said that Mr Miliband had made ‘elementary’ mistakes. ‘What is the vision? What are the values? And more importantly, [what is] the narrative? Because quite frankly, the Tories have a narrative and we don’t,’ he said.","Charismatic former home secretary ruled out suggestions of leadership bid .

"Forget school dinners of lumpy mashed potato, grey mince and mushy carrots. The pupils of Loreto High School certainly have. These days, thanks to a MasterChef in the school kitchen, they enjoy fresh-caught mackerel with beetroot and kale salad, or Thai-style fishcakes with pak choi. And although meals are five-star quality, they cost a mere £2.35. That includes pudding, which instead of soggy apple crumble, is more likely to be lemon and rosemary chocolate truffle. The school called in MasterChef semi-finalist Adam Leavy and Sukhdev Singh, both formerly of acclaimed Manchester restaurant Abode, after students complained about boring dinners. Scroll down for video . Gourmet: Masterchef finalist Adam Leavy (right) and top chef Sukhdev Singh (left) have come in to transform the lunch menu at Loreto High School and are now serving up the 'best school meals in Britain' Spiced up: The pair were hired after pupils at the school complained that the lunch menu was boring . They had to go through an audition against other top quality chefs - each cooking up a two course meal from the ingredients given to them - much like on Masterchef. And the pair impressed so much that Headmaster Peter Tite instantly hired them, and now the children are tucking into the likes of smoked mackerel, kale and ciabatta - for just £2.35 a day. 'The kids don't trust some of the things we put on the plates, but most of the time they end up loving it,' said Mr Leavy, who is now cooking up to 500 school meals a day. Amuse bouche: The chefs offer taster sessions of the food before serving the meals to the whole school . 'I've got plans to deliver some ambitious dishes in the future - we want to start them on macaroons soon.' A typical school lunch is now something most of us would be very happy to find on our plates while out at a fancy restaurant. An example of what the children might find on their plates on an average day is smoked mackerel, which is caught on the day, with beetroot and kale salad, and a lemon and rosemary chocolate truffle for dessert. New fad: Kale chips have become a huge hit at Loreto after the chefs introduced them to the menu . Fine fish: Smoked makerel is among the dishes the children can eat for just £2.35 a day for a full meal . All the rave: A beetroot and kale salad which the Loreto High pupils say they love . Time for pudding: Lemon and rosemary chocolate truffles and chocolate mousses - topped with cream . Or if that doesn't pique their interest, the chefs are happy to whip up a chocolate mousse with caramelised biscuits and cream as a treat. The only problem now is that parents are having to contend with the chefs' high standards when cooking for their children at home. One mother said: 'My son used to complain that the food was boring. Now he comes home talking saying he will only he eat his salad with extra virgin olive oil. Gone are the days of sausage and mash. 'These are the best school meals in Britain. The only problem is my son comes home and now he turns his nose up at beans on toast.' Used to the best: The pupils are now going home expecting top food from their parents too . Kale salad (or as they call it, 'that grass stuff') and ciabatta ('posh bread'), are the latest culinary crazes at Loreto High. Mr Singh said: 'It's a bit hit and miss. But most of the dishes they love. Some of the culinary delights available to Loreto High pupils include: . 'Every week we do small little testers to see their reaction. So last week we let them try some kale, and now they can't get enough of it.' The chefs' decision to leave their restaurant jobs and move into cooking at school is largely down to the hours - and the opportunity to get their lives back. This is especially important for Mr Leavy, whose first child is due in November. Mr Tite says he now has plans to ditch the plastic chairs and trays and transform the canteen into a restaurant - complete with 'special of the day' hoardings at the entrance. He added that the canteen's takings have soared since Mr Leavy and Mr Singh got into the kitchen, and staff are now vying for seats at the dining room tables alongside their pupils. Turnover has increased by 21 per cent, while 72 per cent of pupils are now having school lunches - up from 60 per cent last year. 'It's just given the whole school a lift, and it's been fantastic for our pupils from deprived backgrounds,' Mr Tite said.","Masterchef's Adam Leavy and top chef Sukhdev Singh cooking up fine dining .

"Beaming with excitement, this is the moment Sophie Thomlinson was able to ride a bicycle for the first time thanks to generous donations from Daily Mail readers. The two-year-old, who has a form of cerebral palsy after being born prematurely, will use the specially-adapted bicycle to strengthen her legs ahead of surgery to enable her to walk. Readers gave more than £55,000 to help the two-year-old earlier this year after the Mail reported she had been denied NHS funding for the operation - by the same hospital trust which paid for breast enlargement surgery for an aspiring glamour model. Sophie Thomlinson, two, was able to ride a bicycle for the first time thanks to  donations from  Mail readers . Sophie’s spastic diplegia means she cannot stand and instead shuffles around on her knees. She is only able to take a few steps with the aid of a frame and cannot play outside with her friends. Her family, from Dukinfield, Greater Manchester, bought the £1,200 bicycle using some of the donations after her physiotherapist recommended it to prepare her for surgery. Sophie’s mother, former nurse Allison, 40, said it was ‘life changing’. She said: ‘Just using it means Sophie’s doing things and seeing things she’s not seen before because she’s always been strapped up in a wheelchair. ‘It has given her the opportunity to use her legs and so much more independence. The two-year-old, who has a form of cerebral palsy after being born prematurely, will use the specially-adapted bicycle to strengthen her legs before surgery . ‘She can go out with other children now when they’re playing in the street, instead of having to sit in her chair waving at them.’ Mrs Thomlinson said she and husband Craig, 44, would have had to save ‘for a long time’ to buy the bicycle without the donations. ‘Being able to give Sophie this bit of independence has entirely been down to the generosity of Daily Mail readers,’ she added. ‘They have given her wheels and started her on a journey where hopefully the next step will be walking.’ Sophie’s brother Lewis, 14, said: ‘I’m just glad my sister can go out on her bike with me now. We are going to go to the park together.’ Sophie’s spastic diplegia means she cannot stand and instead shuffles around on her knees . Sophie’s mother, Allison, 40, (left) said it was ‘life changing’ because she and husband Craig (right) would have had to save ‘for a long time’ to buy the bicycle without the donations . The bicycle is made by Theraplay, a special needs equipment company, and can be adapted as Sophie grows to give her several years of use. Despite having raised more than £58,000 in total, Sophie’s family faced another blow in May when doctors at Leeds General Infirmary said she wasn’t eligible for surgery as her condition was ‘not severe enough yet’. They now must find another £17,000 to take her to the US for the selective dorsal rhizotomy operation on her spine which should enable her to walk. The bicycle is made by special needs equipment company, Theraplay, and can be adapted as Sophie grows to give her several years of use . Doctors at Leeds General Infirmary said Sophie was not eligible for surgery in May as her condition was ‘not severe enough yet’ An anonymous donor has already pledged free flights for the family to travel to St Louis Children’s Hospital in Missouri when they get the go-ahead from Dr Tae Park, the American surgeon who pioneered the procedure. Funds permitting, Sophie could have the operation next year when she is three. With intensive physiotherapy, she could be walking by five. The Thomlinsons are raising money through the charity Tree of Hope and any excess will go towards helping other disabled children. To donate to Sophie’s surgery fund visit: www.justgiving.com/sophies-tiny-steps. Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy is a neurosurgical technique used to treat spasticity (increased muscle tone) in the lower limbs. The lower vertebrae are opened to reveal the spinal cord which contains the neurones of the central nervous system. These neurones (bundles of nerve fibres) channel messages between the brain and different areas of the body. Electrical stimulation is used to identify and sub-divide sensory and motor nerves. This process continues until the specific nerves and nerve roots affecting the spastic muscles are identified and cut. Due to the size of the nerves and rootlets, this is a very precise procedure and therefore the surgery can last several hours and requires a general anaesthetic. Many months of physiotherapy are needed after the surgery to retrain the legs.","Sophie Thomlinson, two, was born prematurely with cerebral palsy .

"There may be fewer hours of sunlight as we head towards winter, but it could still be possible to get your daily dose of Vitamin D thanks to a revolutionary mushroom. Eating just three of the Active Health mushrooms, sold by M&S, provides 100 per cent of an adult’s recommended daily allowance. The store spent five years developing the mushrooms, which taste just like the regular variety and also contain Vitamin B5 to fight fatigue and potassium to help maintain normal blood pressure. Scroll down for video . Marks & Spencer says eating just three of its new mushrooms will give you your daily dose of Vitamin D . The mushrooms, which sell for £1.20 for 200 grams, are grown in County Monaghan, Ireland, and naturally enriched with the vitamin by exposure to light. Studies have shown that UV light stimulates the mushrooms to convert natural sterols into Vitamin D. Normally mushrooms are commercially produced in dark warehouses as they do not need sunlight to grow, but the M&S mushrooms receive a carefully-measured amount of bright light to simulate sunlight and trigger the Vitamin D-producing action. The main source of the vitamin for humans is sunlight but it also occurs in some foods such as oily fish and eggs and is necessary for strong bones and teeth. M&S spent five years developing the mushrooms . As many as 70 per cent of Britons are thought to have a Vitamin D insufficiency, which is believed to be caused by diet and the country’s poor weather and short winter days. Claire Hughes, M&S nutritionist, said: ‘It’s taken us over five years to bring these mushrooms to our shelves, but it has been worth the wait – they provide 100 per cent of the recommended daily allowance of Vitamin D and are a delicious way of making dinner even healthier.’ Last year scientists presented a study at the American Society for Biochemistry and Microbiology meeting in Boston showing that any mushrooms could be enriched with Vitamin D by placing them in sunlight between 10am and 3pm for 30 to 60 minutes. Cooking did not remove the nutrient and even harvested mushrooms would continue to produce it as long as they were placed in direct sunlight, according to lead author Dr Michael Holick. He said: ‘Yes, we are talking about regular mushrooms. Just take them out of the packaging and place them in the sunshine. It doesn’t matter which way up they are, after about 30 minutes they should produce a good source of vitamin D.’ Growers in the U.S. and Australia have been using the practice for some years, but the M&S mushrooms are believed to be the first in Europe to have been produced with increased Vitamin D levels in mind. The brand’s Active Health range already includes eggs, milk, yoghurt and cheese with added Vitamin D. Its Brussels sprouts enriched with selenium, which helps thyroid function and could help protect against cancer, will go on sale on October 17.","M&S spent five years developing the revolutionary mushrooms .

"A killer who stabbed his partner and six-year-old son to death said money did not ‘mean anything’ to him and that ‘happiness is the main thing in life’ as he launched a legal battle to inherit his victims’ estate. The family of Lisa Clay said they were ‘very distressed’ by Paul Chadwick’s claims as he attempted to use a legal loophole usually reserved for victims of domestic violence in a High Court bid for her £80,000 assets. Chadwick, 35, knifed 40-year-old Miss Clay and their son Joseph dozens of times at their family home in April last year. Paranoid schizophrenic Paul Chadwick has launched a bid to inherit the £80,000 assets of his partner Lisa Clay, who he stabbed to death - along with their six-year-old son - at their family home in April last year . The paranoid schizophrenic was jailed indefinitely in a secure mental health unit after pleading guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. By law, Chadwick is entitled to half the couple’s £120,000 semi-detached house in Bolton-le-Sands, Lancashire, which was largely bought with money Miss Clay inherited on her mother’s death in 2012. But he is battling to obtain Miss Clay’s half and other assets including a joint saving account and her pension fund. Her family have described his action as a ‘torment’ for them. Yesterday Chadwick gave evidence at Manchester Civil Justice Centre after being granted permission to leave the Guild Lodge unit near Preston. Wearing a crumpled red and white striped shirt and short blue tie, he said: ‘It is not about benefiting. It is just obviously I have been portrayed in the papers that this is to do with money. ‘I was unwell. I nearly took my own life. I have got about 20 injuries to myself and stuff. ‘This is to put to the courtroom that I was very unwell at the time. I have been through the worst that I could ever imagine. It can’t get any worse than I already have. ‘I have lost more than any money that can be given to me. I have lost more than that. I have not benefited in any way. I have lost Lisa and I have lost my son Joseph. Money cannot take away from that. ‘Money does not mean anything in life, happiness is the main thing in life.’ Asked about his statement to police in which he admitted the stabbings, he added: ‘I would never have taken the steps at all. It was not my hands. It was not me at all. At the time it was not my actions. ‘It was not me, that is all I can say. It was a place where I wouldn’t even wish it on my worst enemy. ‘I loved them to bits and whatever happens I have got memories of them no one can take that away from me, nobody.’ He later broke down in the witness box when asked about the injuries he inflicted on his son, which he insisted he had no memory of. Representing Miss Clay’s family, David Gilchrist accused Chadwick of using the hearing to put ‘his version of events’ into the public domain. He said: ‘It appeared from his evidence that he regarded these proceedings as a vehicle for him to put his side of the version of events. ‘The fact that he has brought this application for those reason in my submission counts against the jurisdiction being exercised in his favour.’ Miss Clay’s aunt Greta Squires described the killings as ‘brutal’ and pointed out that Chadwick will still benefit from the sale of the house. She said: ‘This has added to our distress.’ Chadwick is battling to obtain Miss Clay’s half of the home they owned together and other assets including a joint saving account and her pension fund. Her family have described his action as a ‘torment’ for them . Before the hearing Chadwick made a bid to hold the proceedings in private. Representing him, Michael Whyatt, told Judge Mark Pelling QC: ‘He is concerned he has been portrayed as some sort of money-orientated individual who is callously in pursuit of funds to which he has no rightful claim.’ He said his client ‘wanted to get something back in terms of recognition’ that his actions did not reflect his character. Judge Pelling said the default position was of open justice, and it was ‘in everybody’s interests’ that the case was heard in public. The court heard how Chadwick had been acting ‘strangely’ and appeared ‘paranoid’ in the week before the killings in 2013. He stabbed his partner of 11 years 32 times and his son 25 times on April 9, before turning a knife on himself and falling down the stairs in a botched suicide attempt. A pathologist’s report revealed both victims showed signs they had defended themselves and had smaller wounds that showed Chadwick had ‘prodded’ them with a knife while they were alive. His mother Susan called police after seeing Miss Clay’s body through the letterbox when she visited the house because the family had failed to meet her as planned. She told the hearing: ‘I was shouting all their names and there wasn’t a sound in the house at all. I was on the phone to the emergency services, the next thing I saw was Paul with a very white face falling down the stairs.’ After giving evidence, Mrs Chadwick, who wept during her son’s testimony, said: ‘Can I just mention that they were very loved and they all loved each other. She was like a daughter to me Lisa.’ The law states those convicted of murder or manslaughter cannot inherit from their victims or profit in any way from their crimes. But under the Forfeiture Act of 1982, there is clause allowing this to be ‘modified’ due to exceptional circumstances in the conduct of the offender or deceased. For example, if a battered wife who has suffered years of violence at the hands of her husband suddenly retaliates, accidentally killing him, she may still be able to inherit his estate.","Paul Chadwick is jailed indefinitely in a secure mental health unit .

"Runaway: Zahra Halane, 16, tweeted about her fears for her missing ginger kitten, saying it had ‘disappeared’ after her ‘husband threw [it] outside . She is the ‘terror twin’ who has called for the execution of soldiers and become a jihadi bride in war-torn Syria. But schoolgirl Zahra Halane has revealed her biggest worry: the welfare of her cat. The 16-year-old tweeted about her fears for her missing ginger kitten yesterday, saying it had ‘disappeared’ after her ‘husband threw [it] outside’. A picture of the tomcat lying on a man wearing a camouflage T-shirt was posted to a Twitter account, believed to belong to the teenager, who is in Syria with her twin sister Salma. She also posted a picture – believed to be of herself – in a full veil holding an AK47, kneeling in front of the IS flag, a dagger and a grenade. The cat is called Abu Hureyra after an ancient settlement by the Syrian city of Raqqa, the Islamic State stronghold where the girls are thought to be living. Zahra wrote: ‘Abu hureyra disappeared!!!! inshaa Allah [God willing] we will be reunited in jannah [paradise].’ She accompanied the message with symbols for a crying face and a heart, later adding: ‘my husband threw outside (sic)’. Previous tweets from the account included messages such as ‘I support the executions of Syrian soldiers. It’s self defence’ and pictures of machine guns alongside the Koran. Zahra is thought to have married in Syria since disappearing with her sister overnight from their home in the Chorlton area of Manchester in June. The pair have 28 GCSEs between them and were planning to become doctors, having just finished their first year of sixth-form college, but were said to have been radicalised over the internet. Their father Ibrahim and mother Khadra travelled to the region to try to bring them home, but without success. The couple have 10 children and their 21-year-old son Ahmed is said to be fighting with Al Shabaab, a militant group in Somalia. A senior member of the Somali community in Manchester said yesterday they were ‘appalled’ at the new image. ‘Everyone is really shocked the twins are still in Syria with these so-called jihadi fighters who are carrying out such atrocities,’ he said. ‘Also to talk about a missing cat like she was making a home is very disturbing. We, as a Somali people, are all appalled by their actions but we are also desperately sad for their family. Scroll down for video . A picture of the tomcat lying on a man wearing a camouflage T-shirt was posted to a Twitter account, believed to belong to the teenager, who is in Syria with her twin sister Salma . ‘They came to the UK to provide a better future for their children and to make sure they got a good education. They don’t understand where it all went wrong.’ Zahra’s tweets come two days after another British jihadi bride – an 18-year-old using the name Al jazraweeya – wrote that she wanted to see David Cameron’s head ‘on a spike’. She also called on other young girls to join the cause in Syria. IS and its supporters have used social media extensively to spread their message but their accounts are regularly shut down. Yesterday one reportedly belonging to a linked group – Al Nusra Al Maqdisia (Supporters of Jerusalem) – threatened to kill Twitter employees over the closures. The account, now suspended, warned workers that they could be killed by ‘lone wolves’. Three hate preachers hosted an online conference to lure disillusioned young British Muslims into fighting with jihadists. The clerics, who served jail sentences in the UK for soliciting murder and fuelling racial hatred, urged more than 200 to join Islamic State extremists. Atillah Ahmed, Abdullah el-Faisal and Mizanur Rahman claimed democracy was leading people astray and women captured during the conflict were the ‘spoils of war’. Ahmed told his audience on the chat site Paltalk that Western jihadists were ‘struggling to bring honour to the community of Islam’. The conference will heap fresh pressure on the Government to bolster measures to block online content that helps radicalise impressionable young men.","Zahra Halane is believed to have travelled to Syria to join IS militants .

"For 16 years, she has been the voice of morning news and debate on the BBC’s Radio 5 Live. Yesterday, Victoria Derbyshire hosted her popular current affairs show for the last time, prompting a flood of tributes from loyal listeners. And now, on the brink of making the leap to TV with a daily programme on BBC News, she has revealed that behind her success lies a difficult childhood which gave her the courage to ‘be bold to anyone’. She told listeners yesterday: ‘I have loved talking to you over the last 16 years, and even more I have loved listening to you. You have told me so many things about your lives which I will never, ever forget and for which I’m very grateful.’ Scroll down for video . An uneasy relationship: Miss Derbyshire, pictured as a small child with her father Anthony, claims he was an ‘aggressive’ man who abused her, her mother and her younger brother and sister . The mother-of-two revealed her troubled childhood as she makes her way from radio to BBC News, but her father Anthony, 77, has denied he ever hit his children . But the Radio Academy Award winner has recently shared details of her own early life which could match many a phone-in. Her father Anthony was an ‘aggressive’ man who abused her, her mother and her younger brother and sister, she claimed. Mother-of-two Miss Derbyshire, 45, said: ‘It was very much us four against him. He was aggressive and violent and not loving in any way. Not like a father should be.’ She described rushing to make him a cup of tea after work or ‘there would be all hell to pay’, and slipping her mother’s Valium into his tea hoping to ‘calm him down’. Asked if the tactic worked, she said: ‘I didn’t monitor it. I should have taken notes, “Today, one Valium, no row; today, no Valium, he threw a pan at mum’s head”.’ She described her mother Pauline, 74, as ‘absolutely brilliant’. The siblings tried to protect her, she claimed, by sitting at the top of the stairs to listen to parental rows. She said: ‘[We were] thinking “we don’t know what to do, but we’ll stay awake because if we’re awake, at least that is somehow going to protect her because we’ll know what is happening”. Though I don’t know what we thought we’d do with the information.’ Once she ran to get police because she thought her father was beating her mother, who was locked in a bedroom. But she claimed officers spoke to her father, who was ‘utterly charming’, and left ‘having had a cup of tea’. Her parents divorced in 1985 when she was 17 – a moment she called a ‘liberation’ – and her mother remarried her ‘amazing’ late stepfather Des Whitehead. Miss Derbyshire, centre with (pictured left to right)  mother Pauline, sister Alexandra and brother Nicholas . In the interview with The Guardian last month, Miss Derbyshire said: ‘My attitude now is that I have no feelings towards him, because I don’t want to waste any energy on him. ‘I think when I first had children, that’s when I really understood the depths to which he had sunk – your own child, how can you hit them?’ She put her fearless style – which has seen her grill her boss, former 5 Live controller Adrian Van Klaveren, and put former Justice Secretary Ken Clarke on the spot over his views on rape victims – down to resilience she learnt growing up. ‘I remember being bold to my father and feeling I was sticking up for myself and for us, and so, in comparison to that, I think I can be bold to anyone,’ she said. Mr Derbyshire, 77, insisted he had never hit his children and said their childhood in an eight-bedroom Tudor mansion in Lancashire, now worth £2.5million, was ‘brilliant’. He admits striking his ex-wife, claiming she was aggressive to him. He said: ‘She implies she was dragged up in a tough northern environment – rubbish. She was brought up in the lap of luxury: elocution lessons, dance lessons, private school.’ Mr Derbyshire, a retired director of several companies, added: ‘I was working away a lot, sometimes at weekends. Troubled: The presenter, who fronted a popular current affairs show for 16 years, said her troubled upbringing made her 'bold' Wealth: The £2.5million eight-bedroom Tudor mansion in Lancashire where Miss Derbyshire grew up . ‘When I went home I just wanted peace and quiet. I used to talk to them reasonably when they did something wrong, not shout and rave at them as she says. I wasn’t all cuddly and that sort of thing, but I was loving in the sense I provided for them and worked very, very hard to give them everything.’ He has lost touch with his three children but displays their photographs and school projects at his council flat near Bury. Miss Derbyshire’s only recent contact with her father was a series of emails in 2009 and 2010 asking him to come on her morning talk show to discuss domestic violence. He declined, but said his daughter was ‘very good at her job’. He added: ‘I have never held a grudge. She’s living her life now, I’m living mine. But it is sad really, very sad.’ In a statement, Miss Derbyshire said: ‘Society knows that abusers nearly always deny their behaviour. It’s incredibly disappointing, but not surprising, that he is seeking to continue his abuse by attacking and blaming the people he once targeted.’ Miss Derbyshire joined Radio 5 Live as co-presenter of the breakfast show 16 years ago and in 2004 took over the morning news. She ended her final programme with a tearful message: ‘It’s time to say farewell, and it is farewell rather than goodbye … And of course I would like to say thank you to you.’ In a tweet, she said BBC director general Tony Hall had thanked her. She said: ‘Bit of a shock when the Director General walked in studio at end & said a few words!’","After 16 years, she has hosted her current affairs show for the final time .

"Leicester City manager Nigel Pearson made the jibe as his side lost to Liverpool . Even by the standards of the football terraces, it’s an inflammatory jibe. But video footage has emerged showing the manager of Leicester City told one of his own team’s supporters to ‘f*** off and die’. The extraordinary incident came during a match on Tuesday, which Nigel Pearson’s side lost to Liverpool. He exchanged abuse with the fan during the final few minutes of the game when both men were sitting in the main stand at the King Power Stadium in Leicester. It is understood that Pearson snapped after the fan called him an ‘utter t***’. The manager admitted his part in the spat, saying after the game: ‘I replied to one idiot in the stands – if he doesn’t like what he sees, then don’t bother coming. ‘Maybe they ought to think about staying at home. We’ve worked hard and will continue to do so. I don’t like the commitment of my players being questioned.’ Pearson, a father of two, is under pressure following a winless streak stretching to nine games but his job is not believed to be at risk. He has a good relationship with the club’s Thai owner, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, and signed a three-year contract last June. But insiders said the club, which is investigating the incident, would not regard swearing at a fan within earshot of children as acceptable. Supporters appeared to agree and condemned Pearson’s actions. Cliff Ginetta, chairman of Leicester’s supporters club, said an apology was warranted. ‘He should put his hands up, admit he was out of order, apologise to the people and move on, that’s all everyone wants,’ he said. ‘We don’t want to play it out like a pantomime, we just want to get on with winning games. ‘People are worried and moaning but that’s football fans.’ One supporter wrote online: ‘Not a nice thing to say about a fan who contributes to wages. Managers should be a bit more diplomatic with irate fans, not abuse them.’ Another wrote: ‘Correct me if I’m wrong, the fan hardly abused him. If you said that to a customer at your work you’d be sacked irrespective of what they said to you.’ In a press conference yesterday, Pearson refused to apologise. He said: ‘I have had run-ins with fans in the past and in the heat of the moment these things happen and there won’t be any apology. Video footage has emerged showing the moment the manager of Leicester City told one of his own team’s supporters to ‘f*** off and die . ‘I am very keen to protect my players and myself and I’m more than happy to stick up for myself in that situation and, more importantly protect my players, that’s the root cause of the problem. ‘If people were offended by what happened in some ways that is regrettable – but there’s no need for me to apologise to someone of that ilk.’ A Leicester City spokesman said: ‘We are aware of an incident that took place during Tuesday night’s match and are looking into the matter to establish a full and accurate account of proceedings. ‘Once the facts have been determined and suitably corroborated, we will decide what next steps, if any, should be taken.’","Nigel Pearson exchanged abuse with fan during final minutes of game .

"The father of a boy of 12 who drowned after being swept out to sea during a family holiday last night relived the desperate battle to rescue his son from the waves. Isaac Nash was swimming off the coast of Anglesey, North Wales, with his brother Xander on Friday when they got into difficulties. Their father Adam was able to swim out to save ten-year-old Xander, but Isaac was carried away. Today Isaac's mother, Zoe, 35, a teacher, paid tribute to her 'amazing, special' child who 'packed his life to the full'. Desperate: Isaac Nash was swimming off the coast of Anglesey, North Wales, with his brother Xander on Friday when they got into difficulties. His father Adam, pictured with Isaac, was able to save Xander . She added: 'He was an amazing boy. I thank God for giving me an amazing, special boy for 12 years who packed his life to the full. 'He had an amazing day climbing Snowdon the day before with his dad and brother, Xander. On Snowdon he saw a man propose to his girlfriend at the summit and he was so excited. 'The police and coastguard have been fantastic, and they are continuing to search for our boy. We are taking comfort in hearing all the stories and seeing the pictures of our young man.' he boys’ grandfather had also swum out to rocks to help and managed to grab hold of Isaac, but they were hit by a huge wave which pulled the boy from his grip. Mr Nash, 35, a creative designer, said: ‘He couldn’t hold on to him. There was a lot of seaweed on the rocks which was very slippery. ‘He kept saying, “He has gone, he  has gone”.’ The family, from Highburton, West Yorkshire, had been enjoying a camping holiday in Wales and climbed Mount Snowdon before travelling to Anglesey. Mr Nash said he had told his sons to stay in shallow water off the coast of Aberffraw, but they had got into difficulties after swimming further out to look at barnacles on some rocks. 'Amazing boy': Isaac Nash and his mother Zoe. The family, from Highburton, West  Yorkshire, had been enjoying a camping holiday in Wales and climbed Mount Snowdon before travelling to Anglesey . He said: . ‘It was quite a windy day and the waves were big. Isaac was a good . swimmer, a strong, sporty lad. Xander is younger and not so strong. ‘My dad had been waving at them  and shouting but they couldn’t  hear him.’ Mr Nash said his father, Paul, 61, then swam out to where the boys were near the rocks. He said: ‘As he swam towards them Isaac was shouting. I could sense they were panicking.’ Still . in his trousers, Mr Nash also dived into the sea and swam towards . Xander but they kept getting hit by waves and being separated. He said: ‘We were both quite far out, we were going out to sea. I couldn’t even turn round to see what was going on with Isaac. ‘As soon as I got my feet down I turned round and looked for my dad. He was washed up on to the rocks and just laid flat. ‘His face was just screwed up and there was blood dripping from his arms and legs. ‘He said: “I couldn’t save him, I couldn’t save him.” It was an absolute blur after that. ‘I remember the ambulance being there and our going in it to Bangor Hospital. We were all in shock.’ Daring: Tonight family and friends united in tribute to Isaac, whose father described him as a thrill-seeking boy with a cheeky sense of humour and great sense of mischief. His mother said they were 'so proud of him' RNLI lifeboats, an RAF Sea King helicopter and police searched the seas in ‘horrendous’ conditions after the incident on Friday afternoon. Police underwater teams joined the search for Isaac on Saturday, which continued into yesterday evening in calmer weather, but there was still no signs of his body.

Last night, family and friends united in tribute to Isaac, whose father described him as a thrill-seeking boy with a cheeky sense of humour and great sense of mischief. His mother Zoe, 35, a teacher, wrote on Facebook: ‘We have been lucky to have an amazing and special boy for 12 years. ‘We were so proud of him and he will always be with us.’ She described the search efforts by the RNLI, police and local residents as ‘amazing’. Rough: Aberffraw Beach, where the tragedy happened on Friday. The brothers got into trouble after swimming further out to sea to take a look at barnacles on some rocks . Isaac’s best friend, Joe Lockwood, described him as ‘one of the nicest people I’ve ever met’ and said he was ‘always smiling’. He was a member of his school’s cricket team, which won the  North of England Kwik Cricket Championships last year, and  was successful in athletics and  tae kwon do. Friends plan to hold a balloon and lantern tribute to Isaac tonight to raise money for the RNLI.

"Australian novelist Richard Flanagan holds a copy of his book 'The Narrow Road to the Deep North' as he poses as winner of the 2014 Man Booker Prize . An Australian writer has won this year’s Man Booker Prize with a novel inspired by his father’s experiences as a Japanese prisoner of war. Richard Flanagan, 53, won the accolade for The Narrow Road to the Deep North, which is dedicated to ‘prisoner 335’ – his father Archie. His win will be all the more poignant since his father died last year - several hours after Flanagan called to tell him the book was finished. The novel, which is his sixth, centres upon the experiences of surgeon Dorrigo Evans in a Japanese POW camp on the now infamous Thailand-Burma railway. The Tasmanian-born author is the third Australian to win the coveted prize and will be seen by some as a conservative choice. Critics have hit out at a decision to expand the prize this year to include all English writing rather than novels only from the UK, Ireland and the Commonwealth. For the first time in its 46-year history, two American writers were shortlisted – but neither of them could win over the judges. Announcing the prize winner, judging panel chair AC Grayling said Flanagan’s book was an ‘outstanding’, ‘superb’ novel. He said: ‘It’s been a privilege to be on the Booker panel in a year when there have been such extraordinary books. And to end up with a book of this stature. ‘The best and the worst of judging books is when you come across one which kicks you so hard in the stomach that you can’t get up the next morning. You know it’s something extraordinary. And this is what happened with this book.’ He said the panel of six judges took three hours to decide and that the decision-making process was a ‘collegiate’ experience which produced a unanimous result. He added that although the nationality of the authors caused controversy this year, that he tried to block it out of his head while judging. And he said that his choice had shown fiction set in the past still had its place in contemporary culture, adding: ‘historical fiction is not history.’ ‘This is a magnificent novel of love and war,’ he added. ‘Written in a prose of extraordinary elegance and force, it bridges East and West, past and present, with a story of guilt and heroism.' Lauded: The author is congratulated by Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall as he is presented with the prize  at the Guildhall in London last night . He added: ‘It’s not really a war novel. It’s much more about people and their experience and their relationships. ‘The depiction is timeless. It’s not just about the Second World War, it’s about any war. It’s about the effect on the human being.’ Flanagan was presented with a trophy from The Duchess of Cornwall and a £50,000 cheque at a glittering event at London’s Guildhall last night. The shortlist also included Indian-born London Neel Mukherjee, whose The Lives Of Others, set in India, was the 5/2 favourite to win with bookmakers William Hill. Two other British authors were among the six books to be shortlisted – former winner Howard Jacobson for his novel J, and Ali Smith for her ‘genre-bending’ novel How To Be Both. The two US writers were Joshua Ferris for To Rise Again At A Decent Hour and Karen Joy for We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves. Previous winners have included Hilary Mantel, who won two prizes for her novels Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies. Yesterday, Royal Mail announced that it would create a special postmark in Flanagan’s honour.","The book is dedicated to 'Prisoner 335' - his father Archie .

"Miracle spine patient Darek Fidyka was stabbed 18 times by an old friend because of rumours he had an affair with the man's wife, it is claimed. The Polish fireman was attacked and left for dead by Jaroslaw Szczepanik, who suspected the pair had a three-year affair behind his back. Mr Fidyka, 40, made headlines this week after breakthrough treatment in Poland by British doctors allowed him to walk again for the first time since the attack. Scroll down for video . Darek Fidyka walked for the first time this week after being left paralysed when his old friend stabbed him 18 times, severing his spine . He said Szczepanik, also a fireman, was jealous that he got together with his former-wife Justyna after the pair divorced. But yesterday, it was claimed Mr Fidyka may have become involved with the woman before she divorced her husband. Szczepanik's father Jerzy, 70, a fire station chief, said his son was 'paranoid' that she was seeing another man when their marriage hit the rocks. He told the Daily Mail: 'During the last three years of their marriage, he said that his wife was cheating on him. 'I wouldn't listen to him. I told him he was just being paranoid. 'During this time, Justyna was talking about a divorce. Jaroslaw never caught her, so he never knew for sure.' Towards the end of the marriage, his son, a heavy drinker, was arrested and jailed for a year for attacking his wife - who then divorced him while he was in prison. Jaroslaw Szczepanik (left), his old friend, launched the attack after hearing rumours Fidyka had been having an affair with his estranged wife Justyna (right) before the pair separated . His father added: 'It was only obvious to him what was going on when he came out of jail and found another man living in his house.' The two love rivals knew each other from their youth, and worked as volunteer firemen for sister fire stations. In 2006, Mr Fidyka divorced his wife Beata, who was a school friend of Justyna, and left the home they shared with their son Przemek, now 20. It is understood Mr Fidyka moved into Justyna's home after her husband was jailed in 2009, living with the former couple's two children. Fidyka moved in to Justyna's home when her former husband was jailed for attacking her . When Szczepanik was released, he was banned in a court order from visiting the house and the children. The father added: 'It was an extremely emotionally difficult thing for him to go through. It wasn't just that the woman had left him, but also that there was another man living there. 'My son was an extremely good workman and we built the house together.' The attack happened on July 27 2010, when Mr Fidyka woke up and heard someone damaging his car. He went outside and was confronted by Szczepanik, who chased after him and knifed him 18 times. The attacker then ran off to a nearby tree and committed suicide by hanging himself. 'My son had many friends and loved playing football,' the man added. 'It's sad but I wish Darek all the best. It's not his fault.' Following the attack, Mr Fidyka was left with no movement or feeling from the waist down and facing life in a wheelchair after one of the wounds completely severed his spinal cord. But this week it was announced that he has learnt to walk again with a walking frame two years after undergoing revolutionary treatment in a British-led breakthrough. His amazing recovery, which brings hope to paralysed people across the world, will mean he can now resume his favourite hobby of hunting and also drive an adapted car. The procedure involved transplanting cells from his nose into the damaged part of his spine to repair his spinal cord, enabling the ends of severed nerve fibres to grow and join together - something that was previously thought to be impossible. It was led by Professor Geoffrey Raisman and a team from University College London, funded by the Nicholls Spinal Injury Foundation and UK Stem Cells Foundation. Speaking from his hospital in Wroclaw, Mr Fidyka said he had decided to live with Justyna after she divorced her husband. He said: 'The man was a criminal, and an alcoholic. When he realised I was with his former wife, he decided to take revenge. 'I knew the girl from my youth days. After my marriage ended, we decided to give it a go. 'On the night it happened, I heard that somebody was wrecking my car. I didn't know he had a knife. If I'd had known I would have taken my knife or rifle. 'I'm still angry with him for what he did but it gets less as time goes by.' It is understood Justyna and Mr Fidyka broke up six months ago, with the pair now not on speaking terms. Speaking from her detached countryside home in Rusiec, central Poland, Justyna said she could not comment on her former father-in-law's claims. In 2010 Jaroslaw stabbed Fidyka 18 times outside the house in Poland (pictured) before hanging himself . The 40-year-old is learning to walk again after receiving pioneering treatment from doctors in London . She said: 'What I went through four years ago was a huge psychological drain and talking about it now just brings it back. 'I wish Darek a good recovery and all the best. But what happened between Darek and I is between us.’ Last night, Mr Fidyka denied he had an affair with Justyna and insisted they only got together after her divorce. He said: ‘You can ask anyone in the neighbourhood, they’ll tell you we weren’t together before her divorce. ‘I only moved in with her after the divorce.'","Darek Fidyka was stabbed 18 times by his friend, severing his spine .

"Aspiring politicians should not be allowed to become MPs until they are 40, Andrew Marr has said. The former BBC political editor said politicians should have to ‘do something first’ to tackle a lack of ‘gritty real-world experience’ in the House of Commons. The broadcaster, 55, who presents BBC current affairs programme The Andrew Marr Show, pointed out that MPs used to spend years in different careers first. Many had ‘built their own companies and knew the inside out of a balance sheet’. BBC presenter Andrew Marr (pictured) believes no-one under the age of 40 should be allowed to become an MP . Currently, there are 56 MPs under the age of 40. They comprise 25 Labour members, 24 Conservatives, six Liberal Democrats and one Plaid Cymru member. Prominent Tories include Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss, 39, and business minister Matthew Hancock, 36. Labour’s list includes 35-year-old shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna and shadow minister for public health Luciana Berger, 33. The number could increase after the 2015 general election, since 115 of the candidates selected so far from all parties are in their 30s – and 43 are under 30. Marr made his comments while speaking at the Cheltenham Literature Festival about his first novel, Head of State. The presenter, who has been reporting on parliamentary affairs for 30 years, said MPs had very different backgrounds when he started out as a journalist. Asked for his views on modern politics, he replied: ‘I’m turning into an old git, so I’ll give you a passionate old git response to that. Prominent Tories: Business minister Matthew Hancock (left), 36, would be excluded from becoming an MP if the rule was enforced, as would 39-year-old environment secretary Elizabeth Truss . It would also exclude Labour's 35-year-old shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna (pictured) ‘When I started out politics reporting, there were still Tories who had had a good war, built their own companies, had really good experience, knew the inside out of a balance sheet, had employed and sat and worried about profits. On the Labour side you had ex-miners, metal workers, ex-factory hands, ex-posties. So there were people all over the House of Commons who had done other things first and that really mattered. ‘We’ve lost most of that gritty, real-world experience in the House of Commons. I would like to see nobody – this is ridiculous but I’m going to say it anyway – nobody in the House of Commons until they are 40. That way they always have to do something first.’ In the wide-ranging interview, Marr also lamented the fact that today’s politicians have lost a ‘radical amount of power’ and ‘can’t even tax the biggest companies in this country’. On his own career, he said: ‘If I had my time again I would spend more time over economics text books, really trying to understand economics jargon, to explain what they’re doing in clear terms because that drives everything else.’ Andrew Marr has given colourful insight into the prime ministers who have passed through Downing Street during his career as a political journalist. Speaking in Cheltenham, he revealed that in Tony Blair’s time, Number 10 was full of ‘very beautiful girls’ who were ‘half in love with him’, while his wife Cherie would follow him around ‘with a scowl’. After the 1997 election, Mr Blair was famously pictured with the record-breaking 101 female Labour MPs – dubbed the Blair Babes. 'Blair Babes': Former Prime Minister Tony Blair pictured in 1997 with female MPs . In contrast, Gordon Brown was surrounded by ‘a gang of rather overweight big boys with red faces who glared a lot and came from Scotland’. On Lady Margaret Thatcher, Marr recalled: ‘The whole place was almost pin-drop silent in case the PM walked through. They adored her, but were terrified of her.’ But her successor John Major felt ‘besieged’, Marr claimed. ‘It felt as if there were forces out there, Thatcherite forces, socialist forces, all ganging up. He was sitting there feeling misunderstood and unloved.’ Marr praised David Cameron, saying he is loved by the civil service because ‘all they want is for decisions to be taken clearly’. He added: ‘They send him papers in the evening and he’s the first PM since Blair where the papers come back the following morning and he has read them all, ticked and underlined and said yes or no. He conducts the business of Number 10 very well.’ Marr joked that Boris Johnson’s ‘limitless ambition’ means he won’t be happy until he is prime minister – ‘and then he would want the White House’.","Andrew Marr says Commons has a lack of 'gritty real-world experience'

"In his Cabinet days, he was a rather substantial figure. But as this picture shows, Lord Falconer is now just two-thirds of the man he used to be – after shedding five stone. His secret? An unconventional diet of apples and Diet Coke. Scroll down for video . Big changes: Lord Falconer has dropped five stone in the past two years after giving up lunch and alcohol . The former Lord Chancellor has revealed he adopted the bizarre regime after looking at the scales and deciding he was ‘about to fall off a cliff’. He told yesterday how he now skips breakfast and lunch, runs five miles in 45 minutes almost every day, and has given up alcohol. To keep him going, he snacks on apples and downs as many as nine cans of Diet Coke – and allows himself one normal meal in the evening. In just two years, he has gone from 16st 6lb to 11st 5lb – a transformation that has left many of his former colleagues speculating about whether ‘Champagne Charlie’ is ill. Transformation: Lord Falconer looking much lighter pictured this week, right, than he did in 2006, left . The 62-year-old, who left the Cabinet seven years ago, said: ‘I found that for me abstinence was much easier to deal with than eating a little. It’s much easier to look forward to my meal in the evening. ‘It appears to have no adverse effect on me. In my old regime I was much more likely to feel drowsy in the afternoon.’ When he was in the Cabinet, Charles Falconer was most at home with a glass of red wine and a plate of red meat. These days it’s a very different story. ‘I had my last drink on December 30. I don’t have a particular date when I’ll start drinking again,’ he said. ‘I’ve also stopped drinking coffee and tea. The big downside consequence is that I have become addicted to Diet Coke. I might drink eight or nine of them a day. I was pleased to see that the EU, after much deliberation, has decided that they don’t cause cancer.’ He said he took inspiration from Lord Lawson, the former Tory chancellor who shed five stone and then wrote a diet book about his methods. Lord Falconer, who once shared a flat with Tony Blair, first adopted the 5:2 diet, which George Osborne has used to get into shape, but later decided a stricter regime was necessary. But the speed of Falconer’s weight loss worried many colleagues, with some convinced he was supporting assisted dying because he was terminally ill himself. For the past few years he has been trying to push through a change in the law to make it easier for terminally ill people to end their lives. He admitted that it had been difficult to lose weight while working in the Cabinet. ‘I was just so fat … I just thought: you’re about to fall over a cliff. There will be no going back. You’ll be fat for ever,’ he said. ‘I felt between 1997 and 2007 that I was the only new Labour minister who would drink at lunchtime.’ He added: ‘A lot of people ask if it has changed my personality. I don’t think it has at all.’ Courtesy of statutelawsociety's channel . Grossly overweight, Lord Falconer was heading down the path to diabetes, coronary heart disease, high blood pressure and stroke. So it is absolutely right that he lost all that weight, and that would have been true regardless of the technique that he used. It’s great that he has given up alcohol, and it will be very beneficial to his long-term health. However, dieticians wouldn’t recommend following his eating plan. Because he is missing breakfast, there is nothing to fuel him all day. The old saying that you should breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince and dine like a pauper is still sensible. His consumption of Diet Coke may be considered excessive. There is no solid evidence that this is harmful, although one side-effect of caffeine can be irritability. And the regime must take iron will, so there is a danger he might fall off it after a while. In order to turn this diet into a life-long commitment, he should approach a professional dietician to tweak the nutrients he is taking in. Since dinner is his only meal, he needs to ensure he is including all the right vitamins and minerals. He needs to include lots of greens as well as oily fish like mackerel. He should also try to retrain his palate, because he obviously has a sweet tooth. Swapping Diet Coke for other drinks may help him to overcome this in the long-term.","Lord Falconer has gone from 16st 6lb to 11st 5lb in two years .

"Madhur Jaffrey has dismissed Balti curry as 'a craze' with 'no authentic origin' and predicted 'it will slowly die' in this country . It is one of Britain's most popular curries. But the popularity of the Balti may soon be over, according to one of the nation's top food writers. Madhur Jaffrey has dismissed the dish as 'a craze' with 'no authentic origin' and predicted 'it will slowly die' in this country. Jaffrey, who was born in Delhi and became a household name with her BBC cookery shows in the 1980s, said Indian food in Britain was slowly getting better. And she said the Balti, which had 'origins in no place we would want to visit', would slowly die out as people moved on to other Indian dishes. The dish, which is thought to have been invented in a Birmingham curry house in 1977, gained popularity in the UK throughout the 1980s and 1990s. It recently appeared in a list of the top ten most popular curries by the British Curry Club. Speaking yesterday at the Cheltenham Literature Festival, Jaffrey said it was an easy way to cook but was not the traditional Indian way. She said: 'I studied the Balti phenomenon quite a few years ago. Around the 80s, I really studied the Balti and whether it had any authenticity or not. I think it was just a craze. 'It was just a version of cooking in a wok and it was stir fried food. 'The heat is so high that sauces get reduced very fast. It's a style of cooking where you have pre-cooked or partially cooked meat sitting there, pressure cooked, and you make different sauces for that meat. That became known as Balti cooking. 'I don't think it has origins in any place we would want to visit.' Jaffrey, who was speaking at the Cheltenham Literature Festival, said British Indian curries used to taste like 'mud' but that technique was slowly improving. She added of the Balti: 'I don't think it has origins in any place we would want to visit. I think it just grew up in Birmingham, then Leeds, then a lot of places around there. 'I think it will slowly die. People like it, they obviously get a kick out of it. But I don't think it has authentic origins.' Jaffrey, 81, who was awarded CBE in 2004, first came to the UK to study at The Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, from which she graduated in 1957. She appeared on a number of cookery programmes including Madhur Jaffrey's Indian Cookery in 1982, Madhur Jaffrey's Far Eastern Cookery in 1989 and Madhur Jaffrey's Flavours of India in 1995. Balti curry  is thought to have been invented in a Birmingham restaurant in 1977 and gained popularity in the UK throughout the 1980s and 1990s . Yesterday, she said she had decided to leave India because of the 'inequality' women faced in the home. And she hit out at sexism in the restaurateur business, saying women had been held back from being chefs because of societal constraints. She said: 'My grandmother and mother ran kitchens for 30 people, 40 people. And they were large households that they ran and they ran them with great efficiency and great care and cleanliness and all the rest of it. 'They didn't need to be told by a man that only men can do the job. Men step in and take away the job when there's money to be made. 'And when you look at the history of chefs, it's men – because for example in a country like India women weren't allowed to go out and mix with the men. There's all kinds of other reasons that kept them back – not their abilities. 'Any woman can run a kitchen, she's used to it for thousands of years. But it's where the men allow women, it's the women's place in society, I think all that has been the problem.' She also advocated teaching more multicultural dishes in schools, to enable children to learn about other cultures. She said: 'They're not only learning each other's cultures but they learn how to cook each other's food. 'That is a wonderful way that schools can teach people about other cultures, and bring food in as a method of learning, which I think in schools is absolutely wonderful.'","Madhur Jaffrey has dismissed Balti dish as 'a craze' with no authentic origins .

"To a generation of children, he is the man who can fix just about anything. But now Bob the Builder has had a refurbishment of his own – and not all viewers are too keen on the result. Animators have created a revamped version of the classic children's television character to star in the new series, broadcast on Channel 5. But fans took to Twitter last night to criticise the new 'Bob', saying he looked like he might 'overcharge for work', 'drink Carling' or even 'vote Ukip'. Scroll down for video . Bob the Builder has had a refurbishment of his own for the new series, but not all viewers are too keen on the result, with some saying he  looked like he might 'overcharge for work', 'drink Carling' or  'vote Ukip' Bob, whose catchphrase is 'Can we fix it – yes we can!' is a friendly building contractor with a gang of anthropomorphised work-vehicles. The catchphrase is the title of the show's theme song, which was a million-selling number one hit in the UK in 2000. After his makeover by toymaker Mattel this year, he now appears younger, slimmer and taller – with a freckly face and big brown eyes. He has also ditched the old denim dungarees for more fashionable slim-fit jeans, a short-sleeved checked shirt and a sports watch. And in comparison to the portly, middle-aged version created in 1998, the new Bob is computer-generated rather than made in stop-frame animation. Bob also has a new home in the bustling metropolis of Spring City, and will use a computer for his building designs, although he will still be seen working at his yard in the village of Fixham. Actor Lee Ingleby (left), who is starring in BBC1 drama Our Zoo, takes over from Neil Morrissey (right), who voiced the handyman from his launch a decade and a half ago . The series, which was created by CGI animation and was first shown on CBBC and later Nick Jr, will now be shown under Channel 5's 'Milkshake' banner. Makers of the show said the new version retained the 'emotional warmth' of the original but die-hard fans reacted with anger on Twitter. Alexandra Tate-Smith said: 'What the hell has happened to Bob the Builder?! A makeover does not suit him.' John Hinde said: 'Oh Dear.. Bob the Builder's changed a bit!' Danny Farrell said: 'What have they done to Bob The Builder? No one is gonna watch it now that's the worst makeover ever.' Maria McAveety said: 'They've broken Bob the builder!

Ingleby - also known for his role as Stan Shunpike in Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban - said: 'I was very excited to be given the opportunity to be the voice of such a well-loved character. My little nephew is such a huge fan of Bob that I had to jump at the chance. Capturing a child's imagination is so important, and I just wish I was half as good at DIY as Bob is.' Christopher Kennan, executive producer of HIT Entertainment, the firm behind Bob, said: 'While the new series retains the emotional warmth that has always given Bob The Builder a firm place in the hearts of young viewers, it's now packed with more humour than ever before.'","Bob the Builder has had a refurbishment of his own, but not all fans are keen .

"A top chef has claimed women find it harder to survive in Britain’s ‘warzone’ kitchens because they are testosterone-fuelled and violent. Tom Kerridge, who owns Britain’s only pub with two Michelin stars, questioned whether it was ‘the industry for them’ because of the ‘threatening’ atmosphere in many kitchens. He added that chefs traditionally needed ‘fire in their belly’ to get the work done, but this may be the reason why fewer women were in the job. Tom Kerridge, who owns Britain’s only pub with two Michelin stars, questioned whether it was ‘the industry for them’ because of the ‘threatening’ atmosphere in many kitchens . However, the television star also said he wanted more women to enter the profession, because it would stop their male colleagues talking about ‘boobs’. Kerridge, 41, who has appeared on the Great British Menu, MasterChef and Saturday Kitchen, was speaking during an appearance at the Cheltenham Literary Festival. He also promoted chuckles from the audience when he spoke about his worst bugbear – people needlessly investing in lots of kitchen equipment. He said people needed to stop being preoccupied with ‘fashionable’ gadgets like centrifuges and just rely on the simple oven and hob. But his controversial comments on women raised some eyebrows in the audience and are likely to provoke the wrath of gender equality campaigners. Kerridge, 41,  spoke about his worst bugbear – people needlessly investing in lots of kitchen equipment . He said of the traditional kitchen: ‘It’s a machine and it’s a monster and it’s full-on. This doesn’t just apply to girls, we have loads of blokes do a runner. ‘The pressure and intensity of cooking for that amount of people is so intense, it’s so full-on. It’s overwhelming. It’s like a warzone almost. ‘I like girls in kitchens a lot because it does bring that testosterone level down a little bit, it does make it not so aggressive. ‘But then at the same point a lot of that fire in the chef’s belly you need, because you need them to force themselves to be ready for dinner service. ‘That’s probably why there’s not so many female chefs. ‘They are out there. It’s just whether it’s the industry for them I’m not sure, at that level.’ However, he did praise one female chef, Lisa Allen, who he said did a ‘phenomenal job’ running the kitchen at Northcote Manor in Lancashire. And when challenged on his view, he added that he would prefer to have more women enter the profession to change its culture. He said that while chefs needed ‘that dynamic of getting things done, that ability to dig deep and be put under pressure,’ some took it too far. He added: ‘To go to the extreme where some kitchens go to, where it’s very uncomfortable and where it is perhaps violent, where it is perhaps feeling threatening, that is taken away a lot by having girls in the kitchen. ‘We try to make it an environment where people feel happy at work, that’s the most important thing. ‘And girls in the kitchen make blokes feel happy at work. It’s a nicer environment.’ He added: ‘It’s a different level of conversation. If there’s 16 blokes in a kitchen all talking about boobs and football – we need girls in kitchens so that we just talk about football.’ Kerridge said that his own kitchen, at gastropub The Hand & Flowers in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, the atmosphere was for the most part friendly. 'We try to make it an environment where people feel happy at work, that’s the most important thing. And girls in the kitchen make blokes feel happy at work. It’s a nicer environment’ He had been running the business with his wife Beth, a sculptor, since 2005 – and the waiting list to book a table is often a year long. But for those who cannot wait to sample some of his cooking, his most important tip for making his dishes at home was to ditch all unnecessary equipment. He said it was his bugbear that people invested in expensive gadgets when a basic oven was enough. ‘There’s new methodology and there’s new ideas and there’s new technique but there’s no new sea bass,’ he said. ‘So many chefs get confused with fashion and idea and are all about technique and showcasing and foraged ingredients and things being put through centrifuges. ‘Just cook it in a pan and serve it with a bit of butter. Get an amazing ingredient and treat it beautifully.’ He added: ‘I have been married to my wife for 14 years and we have never had a microwave in our house. ‘What do you need a microwave for when you’ve got an oven? That’s all you need. You need an oven and a blow torch. ‘And give yourself time.'","Tom Kerridge, 41, owns Britain’s only pub with two Michelin stars .

"Hugh Bonneville was forced to fill in a form and pay an administration fee – just for obtaining his own photograph . He is one of the most well-known faces of television. But it seems even Hugh Bonneville cannot escape the endless bureaucracy of the BBC, as he discovered last week. The actor, who stars as Ian Fletcher in the BBC series W1A, found himself forced to fill in a form and pay an administration fee – just for obtaining his own photograph. Speaking at the Cheltenham Literature Festival, the show’s director John Morton told a chuckling audience that BBC staff refused to let the actor have his own photograph without following the time-consuming procedure. Mr Morton said: ‘I got copied into an email in which Hugh Bonneville had been asked by a fan, could they have a signed photo of him as Ian Fletcher. ‘He didn’t have one so he emailed the BBC and said is there a photo of me as Ian Fletcher that I could acquire to sign and send to this fan. ‘The person replied and said you go to the BBC publicity site, you follow the link, you fill in the form and you pay £55. ‘He emailed back and said are you sure that a main character in one of your shows has to fill this in? And the person emailed back saying “yes this is the case”. ‘Hugh then copied all that into (Director General) Tony Hall.’ It comes after the BBC was criticised for ‘ridiculous box-ticking’ after it emerged applicants seeking freelance assignments with the BBC are being asked if they are gay and whether they received free school meals. The new 31-page questionnaire has been ridiculed over the intrusive and apparently pointless questions, loaded with impenetrable jargon and acronyms. But managers insisted the form-filling is designed to ensure the BBC is meeting its ‘diversity’ targets.

"Mr Marsh, 64, works at St George’s Hospital in Tooting, south London . A leading neurosurgeon has spoken of the ‘torture’ of keeping a stiff upper lip in the face of the suffering he sees in his job. Henry Marsh said yesterday that doctors had to hide the distress they feel at patients’ pain because families did not want to see them ‘weeping at the end of the bed’. The consultant, who was made a CBE in 2010, said neurosurgery had a high potential for ‘catastrophe’. He added: ‘It’s difficult to know how people cope. ‘It’s torture. And you can’t show it. Patients and their families don’t want to see you weeping at the end of the bed.’ Mr Marsh, 64, who works at St George’s Hospital in Tooting, south London, has become known for his outspoken views. Earlier this year, he questioned how effective cycle helmets were at preventing brain damage. Speaking at the Cheltenham Literature Festival about his memoir, Do No Harm, he criticised NHS bureaucracy, saying: ‘You need management, you need regulation. ‘The problem is, it needs to be intelligent. With the bureaucracy in this country, it’s not. It’s one size fits all.’ Scroll down for video . Henry Marsh said yesterday that doctors had to hide the distress they feel at patients’ pain because families did not want to see them ‘weeping at the end of the bed’ (File photo) He said: ‘It does make it very irritating when you’re lectured to by a young person about how you have to show empathy for patients and how to lift cardboard boxes. It’s grotesque. ‘If you treat stupid, you make stupid. If you get people doing silly unnecessary paperwork, as the nurses do, you damage the rest of it.’ Mr Marsh, 64, who works at St George’s Hospital in Tooting, south London, earlier this year, questioned how effective cycle helmets were at preventing brain damage (File photo) He gave the example of nurses being needlessly forced to check the stools of neurosurgery patients, saying: ‘My criticism is of this sort of bull****. You should talk to the neurosurgery doctors and say, “what information do you need to treat your patients?”. Instead there’s a directive from above. It’s humiliating and dumb.’ Mr Marsh said useful equipment was often scrapped simply because manufacturers made it difficult to get spare parts. He said: ‘The equipment manufacturers are capitalist. They need to bring out new models all the time. ‘If you look at any hospital, you can see a huge amount of second-hand equipment basically not being used.’ And he said that reduced working hours for junior doctors were ‘wrong’ and would mean younger surgeons gained less hands-on experience. He added: ‘Surgery is a practical craft. How you learn is very important.’","Henry Marsh, 64, works at St George’s Hospital in Tooting, south London .

He said of the Prince: ‘His public persona is one of being a figure of fun, always saying silly and inappropriate things. ‘It was very different from my experience of him, which was of a raging intellect. He gets bored very easily and therefore to make things interesting for himself is provocative. He’s very funny. ‘You can see why, if you’re easily offended, most of the things he says to you, it would be easy [to offend]. ‘But I’m used to politicians and banter, where basically if take you one view, they will take the opposite one for sport.

"Sir Roy Strong complained that visitors are now not engaging with the nation's treasures and instead walking around 'on autocue' Next time you make a beeline for the audio guides at a museum, it might be an idea to think again. According to one of Britain's most respected curators, taped commentaries are ruining the nation's exhibitions and turning visitors into 'zombies'. Sir Roy Strong complained yesterday that visitors are now not engaging with the nation's treasures and instead walking around 'on autocue'. The 79-year-old said audio guides tended to 'go on' too long, leading people to blindly stand in front of paintings or exhibits for hours. Sir Roy, former director of the National Portrait Gallery and the Victoria and Albert Museum, said he now feared people were beginning to prefer audio-guides to the actual artworks. He said: 'With these sound guides, there's a tendency to tell you too much and to go on too much. 'Often, some of these gallery guides go on and on and on. And you see people on autocue going around like zombies. 'It's good if the person can have their own discovery.' Sir Roy made his outspoken criticism at the Cheltenham Literature Festival, where he was speaking about The Laskett Garden. The garden, in Herefordshire, is the largest private formal garden to be created in England since 1945 and was a 30-year labour of love for Sir Roy and his late wife Julia Trevelyan Oman. He was quick to point out that visitors to the Laskett receive only scant information about each section. But recalling one mosaic exhibition he saw recently, he joked that he urged one visitor to stop listening to the guide, saying: 'Look at the mosaic, woman, not her!' He also remembered becoming exasperated when observing another museum visitors' group looking at an iPad version of Rembrandt's 1642 painting The Night Watch when they were stood in front of the real thing. The 79-year-old said audio guides tended to 'go on' too long, leading people to blindly stand in front of paintings or exhibits for hours . He said: 'They'd rather watch the Night Watch on TV than see the real picture.' Sir Roy, whose wife Julia died in 2003 from pancreatic cancer, lives in the village of Much Birch, which lies 8 miles south of Hereford. It was here that the pair created their garden, which is full of references to their romance of three decades. He said that after her death, he tried to clear out some of her plant collections, including her 130 varieties of crab apple trees. His head gardener ended up planting them around Hereford at bus stops and other random locations, which, he said, 'she would have liked.' He added: '[The garden] has been edited down from what it was. It was much more confused before.' On his gardening philosophy, he said: 'I never mind breaking the rules. It accounts for a lot of my success. Never take any notice of whatever anyone else says.'","Sir Roy Strong said visitors are  not engaging with the nation's treasures .

"Luke Maslen was jailed for four years for having sex with the teenage girls . A PE teacher was jailed for four years yesterday after having sex with two teenage pupils who he groomed with flirty online messages and trips to McDonald’s. Luke Maslen, 24, slept with one youngster who was under 16 after giving her cuddly toys and promising to marry her. He also swapped 200 text messages a day with the second girl and professed his love for her – before having sex with her in his car. He approached the two victims separately on social media in 2012, just a year after joining the staff at Callington Community College in east Cornwall. Prosecutor Garth Richardson said he was in a ‘position of trust’ as a teacher but went on to have sex with both teenagers. The older of the girls, who was over 16 at the time, said Maslen’s contact with her began as ‘banter’ on Twitter but they were soon exchanging intimate text messages. She said he asked to meet and drove her to a remote beach, where they sat in his car for an hour. The girl told Truro Crown Court: ‘He kissed me. He texted me later saying “I really like you. I think this could go somewhere”.’ She said on another occasion he sent her a message saying ‘I think I love you’. They went on two other drives and once parked by a lake. She said: ‘He was being really persistent. We just had sex in his car. I did not want to have sex in a car in a lay-by. It is not very romantic for your first time with him.’ Maslen, of Pensilva, Cornwall, told police he was friends with the girl but denied having sex with her. Mr Richardson said the younger girl had sex with the teacher at his home and in her own bedroom. The girl’s mother found out when social workers asked her to take her daughter to the police for questioning. The Crown said: ‘Her daughter said they had sex four or maybe three times and at one point he had even asked her to marry him and told her to keep it secret.’ The girl said he picked her up and drove her to McDonald’s and bought her gifts of flowers and cuddly toys. ‘She told him she was falling in love with him. He told her nothing could happen because he was a teacher.’ Maslen had sex with the girls while teaching at Callington Community College in east Cornwall (pictured) He had sex with one girl the back of his car after driving them to a beach at Whitsand Bay (pictured) Maslen wept as he was found guilty of the sexual offences at Truro Crown Court (pictured) Maslen denied having sex with either girl. His lawyer Rupert Taylor told the court: ‘Luke Maslen was foolish and he was in love but he said they did not have intercourse.’ The teacher broke down in tears when a jury convicted him last month of seven counts of sexual activity with a young person. At a sentencing hearing yesterday judge Christopher Harvey Clark QC said he had been convicted on powerful evidence. Maslen, whose teaching career lies in ruins, was placed on the Sex Offenders Register.","Luke Maslen told one teenager he loved her before they had sex in his car .

"Golden years: Miss Beard has declared she wants to create an ‘old movement’ to encourage people to take pride in growing older . She has tirelessly crusaded against the prejudice older women face in today’s society. Now Mary Beard has declared she wants to create an ‘old movement’ to encourage people to take pride in growing older. The television historian announced yesterday that she is ‘reclaiming the word old’ in the same way ‘queer’ was embraced by the gay community. And the 59-year-old said she hoped to rally older people into joining her in a political debate to take away the word’s negative connotations. She said: ‘I do, partly to annoy people, say “how could you say that to an old woman like me”. I do it to reclaim the word “old”. Old instantly connotes the hunched lady or gentleman. I want an old movement. By the time I die I want “old” to be something we say about ourselves with pride.’ Speaking at the Cheltenham Literature Festival, she said it was insulting that many people think it is a good thing to look younger. ‘I think we have to look quite hard at the vocabulary we use to talk about ourselves and our ageing,’ she said. ‘One of the things that’s most surprising is the way it’s a compliment to say “gosh you don’t look 75”. What’s the matter with looking 75? ‘Somehow to pat someone on the back for looking younger than they are is one of the weirdest examples of doublethink in our culture.’ Miss Beard, who is a professor of Classics at the University of Cambridge, said older people are often stereotyped as grandparents rather than individuals in their own right. She hit out at promotional images of ‘Darby and Joan off to see their grandchildren’ on senior rail card leaflets, instead of people like herself who ‘wanted to go to London’. She added: ‘We can also have fun. We should be thinking, “I want to get my bus pass and my senior rail card and go across the country”.’ Miss Beard, who presented the BBC Two series, Meet the Romans with Mary Beard, also spoke about writer AA Gill, who was branded sexist for criticising her appearance. Proud: The television historian announced yesterday that she is ‘reclaiming the word old’ in the same way ‘queer’ was embraced by the gay community . Watch the full video here, this video was part of a British Academy Debate series on ageing. Miss Beard, who is married with two grown-up children, said: ‘There’s a lot of 50-something women out there who actually like to look like a 50-something. I look like the average 50-something woman that hasn’t had the work done.’ Referring to the Twitter trolls who sent her abusive messages and threats of sexual assault last year, she said she benefited from the ‘unbashability of late middle age’. And she said she is glad she no longer receives wolf whistles from builders: ‘I used to think when builders whistled at me, how crude they were. Now they seem to have got better behaved. My first reaction was, “I’m past whistling ability”. The second reaction was “Yippee”!’","Mary Beard has declared she wants to create an 'old movement'

"Devoted: Michael Pattermore with his terminally ill wife Lynda Bellingham, after it was revealed she has chosen to stop her treatment and die in January . Lynda Bellingham’s husband has spoken of his devastation at the prospect of losing her to cancer. In a heart-breaking interview, Michael Pattemore said the much-loved actress’s death would ‘create the biggest hole’ in his life. And he revealed that he had prayed his terminally ill wife would hold on to see one more Christmas before she loses her battle with the disease. Miss Bellingham, who became a national treasure after starring in the ‘Oxo mum’ gravy adverts, revealed at the weekend that she plans to die within months. She has decided to stop her chemotherapy in November so she can spend a final Christmas with her family before she ‘lets the natural way do its thing’. The 66-year-old’s announcement has led to an outpouring of support online. More than 6.7million people have viewed a Facebook page set up in her honour by ITV lunchtime chat show Loose Women, on which she was a panellist until 2011. On yesterday’s show, Miss Bellingham’s former co-host Coleen Nolan read out a text on her behalf. It said: ‘Oh my goodness, how embarrassing! That so many people have bothered to show their support.’ Mr Pattemore, 58, said he would find it hard to cope but was happy his wife was ‘at peace’. He told Yours Magazine: ‘I am the most positive-thinking guy in the world. Unfortunately it doesn’t matter how positive I am on this one, the good Lord is going to take her. End of. It’s scary and it’s going to create the biggest hole in my life. Scroll down for video . ‘I just don’t know what the next few weeks will bring or how I’m going to cope.

Believe it or not, we’ve never even argued, which I think is probably because we share the same sense of humour. ‘She’s so funny when she’s telling her jokes and so genuinely kind, not to mention so talented. And she’s probably one of the most loving mothers I’ve seen.’ Miss Bellingham, who has received supportive tweets from celebrities such as Les Dennis and Alan Titchmarsh, thanked her followers on Twitter yesterday. ‘Hi guys what a roller coaster 24 hours,’ she wrote. ‘I am overwhelmed by your kindness and generosity and good wishes.’ Her former Loose Women co-hosts had hoped to have her phone in live to yesterday’s show, but doctors advised against it. During the programme, Miss Bellingham emailed the panel, saying: ‘Hi all you gorgeous ladies, speaking to you from my lovely chemo chair, sucking up the drugs! 'Thank you, thank you so much for the support, you have no idea how much it means to me. But please understand I am in a good place.’ The actress, who has also held TV roles in All Creatures Great And Small and The Sweeney, has bowel cancer and secondary tumours on her liver and lungs.

"Radicalised: Ibrahim Kamara killed this week in Syria . With his lopsided smirk, this was the British jihadi killed this week in Syria when he was a cheeky schoolboy. Ibrahim Kamara - known as ‘Iby’ to schoolfriends - was about 13 when this snap was taken. Shocked friends in Brighton remembered their Manchester United-supporting classmate as a happy, bright teenager who made people laugh and was ‘confident with the ladies’. But last year as he did GCSE re-sits, Kamara became radicalised in the seaside city, and in January this year he quit his studies and sneaked off to wage holy war in Syria. Now, the 19-year-old and four others have become the first British fighters to be killed by a U.S. air strike. Yesterday his mother Khadijah Kamara urged other teenagers not to follow in her ‘brainwashed’ son’s footsteps. She also demanded to know why airport officials had not stopped him, given that his passport had expired and he had stolen his 15-year-old brother’s. She said: ‘They look nothing like each other.’ Mrs Kamara, 35, said her eldest son had been a diligent GCSE student in the East Sussex city until he fell under the spell of the Deghayes brothers – three nephews of former Guantanamo Bay inmate Omar Deghayes – and the four boys had all travelled to Syria together. She said: ‘No one should think what he did was right, and no one should follow him,’ she said. Scroll down for video . ‘He was brainwashed, and it happened very quickly. ‘He was a normal respectful boy. He had friends at school. He was studying IT and wanted to become an engineer.’ She said Kamara had always been an ‘obedient’ boy but in the past year had begun to defy her and come home late. In October 2013, he moved out into his own flat in Brighton but still had a key to his mother’s house and often came round for dinner. 'I forgive him': Bu Kamara's mother also said: 'War is the answer to nothing' and urged others not to follow her son's example . She believes this was the time he was plotting with the Deghayes brothers to go to Syria. Mrs Kamara said: ‘These are the boys that he listens to. He didn’t listen to his mother or his brothers. He must have been brainwashed. ‘They all went off together in January. ‘His passport was expired so he went up into my room and got the passport of his 15-year-old brother. ‘It makes me wonder about the border control people because they look nothing like each other. Why they got away with that, I don’t know.’ Mrs Kamara said: ‘I was very angry and disappointed when he told me he was in Syria. I hate the idea of war. ‘I’m upset that he would listen to these people and not to his mother or his brothers who care for him. ‘War is the answer to nothing. No religion tells anyone to fight. ‘I pray that God forgives him. I forgive him - he’s only human and we all make mistakes.’ Last year as he did his GCSE re-sits, Kamara became radicalised in Brighton . In Syria, Kamara joined Jabhat al-Nusra, an affiliate group of Al Qaeda which has sometimes fought with and sometimes against Islamic State . Her 15-year-old son, Mohammed, said his elder brother was ‘easily brainwashed’, adding: ‘But he had lots of good sides, especially his sense of humour - he was very funny. ‘He supported Manchester United and was always making jokes about football.’ Alys Frankland, 19, a classmate of Kamara from Varndean School in Brighton, said: ‘Always chatting, always commenting, Iby was an entertaining addition to many a dull lesson. ‘His astounding confidence - especially with the ladies - and ability to talk to anyone were enviable. We all thought of him as a happy, funny, bright guy, who led a seemingly simple and fulfilled life. ‘I suspect he wasn’t always the favourite of the teachers, but even they couldn’ t help but crack a smile when he came out with a well-timed sarcastic quip.’ She added: ‘As far as I can remember he wasn’t religious at school. I didn’t even know he was Muslim. ‘But some people noticed that in the months before he went to Syria a lot of stuff was being posted on his Facebook page to do with Islam and Allah.’ In Syria, Kamara joined Jabhat al-Nusra, an affiliate group of Al Qaeda which has sometimes fought with and sometimes against Islamic State.","Ibrahim Kamara, known as Khalil al-Brittani, killed in airstrike .

"President Obama today presented the Medal of Honor to a Marine who lost an eye and most of his jaw after fearlessly shielding a comrade from a grenade blast in Afghanistan - and told him that his heroism 'will inspire for generations'. Retired Corporal William 'Kyle' Carpenter, 24, from Flowood, Mississippi, received the nation's top military award in the East Room of the White House, becoming the eighth living recipient for actions in Afghanistan or Iraq. It comes nearly four years after he threw himself on top of a grenade to save his friend, Lance Cpl. Nicholas . Eufrazio, while they stood guard on a rooftop in the Helmand province in November 2010. 'Anybody who has had a chance to get to know this young man, you're not going to get a better example of what you want in an American or a marine,' Obama said at the ceremony. A hero honored: President Obama presented Retired Corporal William 'Kyle' Carpenter, 24, with the Medal of Honor on Thursday - the nation's top military award - for his service in Afghanistan . Proud of his scars: Carpenter lost his right eye and suffered multiple other injuries when he jumped on a grenade to save a comrade in the Helmand Province in 2010. He has since been fitted with a glass eye . 'If any American seeks a model of the . strength and resilience that defines us as a people, I want you to . consider Kyle... Kyle, you not only saved your brother in arms, you displayed heroism in a blink of an eye that will inspire for generations.' Carpenter had been in Afghanistan for just five months when enemy forces, hidden behind walls, lobbed three . grenades into Carpenter's patrol base. One of the grenades injured an Afghan National Army . soldier, the second did not detonate and the third landed close to Carpenter and Eufrazio. Carpenter, who was working as a machine gunner, threw himself between the . grenade and Eufrazio to shield him. The blast deflected down, with . Carpenter absorbing most of the explosion. 'The man you see before you today should not be alive today,' Obama said at the ceremony. 'Hand grenades are one of the most awful weapons of war... If one lands nearby you have mere seconds to find coverage... Up close it's almost certain death.' Thankful: Obama shakes hands with Kyle Carpenter, 24, after presenting him with the award on Thursday . Proud: Carpenter, who is from Mississippi, smiles as the president gives him a round of applause . Tribute: Obama said Carpenter would wear the medal for others who'd served and who didn't make it back . While . Obama has awarded nearly 40 military members with the Medal of Honor, . Kyle Carpenter will be only the third Marine to receive the Medal of . Honor since the start of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. In 2007, Corporal Jason Dunham . was awarded the Medal of Honor posthumously for covering a grenade with . his body during an attack in Iraq in 2004. He was mortally wounded but . saved the lived of at least two fellow Marines. In 2011, Dakota Meyer became . the first Marine Medal of Honor recipient out of the war in . Afghanistan. In 2009, he had ignored orders to stay put and fought his . way into an ambush to help rescue three dozen Afghan and American troops . and to recover four dead Americans. Carpenter . will become the youngest living Medal of Honor recipient when he is . awarded; currently, the title is held by Meyer, who is 25. Carpenter was conscious in the moments after the explosion and, believing he was going to die, he made peace with God. 'I . thought about my family and how devastated they would be that I was . killed in Afghanistan and never made it home,' Carpenter told Business Insider. 'My . last thought [was to] make peace with God, because I knew from how I . felt and how much blood that I could feel I was losing - I knew that I . was not gonna wake up.' But . he did wake up - in a survival that Obama called 'miraculous'. Eufrazio also survived the attack but . the frontal lobe of his brain was seriously injured by shrapnel and it . took him more than two years to be able to talk again. Carpenter was left with life-changing injuries; he lost his right eye and most of his teeth and suffered a broken jaw and . arm, which left him heavily scarred. But Obama pointed out on Thursday that the Marine proudly wears the signs of his service - and even said women loved them. 'I'm . quoting him,' Obama quipped during his speech. '""The girls definitely . like them"". He's working an angle on this thing. I wasn't sure if i was . supposed to say this in front of mom,' he said to laughter. Ceremony: Obama and first lady Michelle walk with Carpenter ahead of the Medal of Honor ceremony . Audience: Mrs Obama joined Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough (2nd L) and other officials for the ceremony in the East Room of the White House . But getting to this point has taken years of doctors at Walter Reed . National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland putting him back together, Obama said. After the blast, Carpenter was in a coma for five weeks before undergoing more than 30 surgeries, including brain surgery, and being fitted with a glass eye. He spent two-and-a-half years in hospital. Yet he's not bitter about it. 'I look back and I'm actually very appreciative I had those two and a half years, because those years put things in perspective more than a whole lifetime of things could if I wasn't there,' Carpenter said, according to the Marine Corps. Before he received the honor, his doctors from the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center said they had been moved by his stoic recovery from injuries that saw his lungs and heart stop several times. In a moving video tribute, Debra L. Malone said he never once complained as he battled for his life and . always giving 110 per cent during recovery. Comrades: Carpenter, pictured left in Afghanistan, threw himself on the grenade to protect Lance Cpl. Nicholas Eufrazio, right, in November 2010. Both men survived but suffered serious injuries . Brave: Carpenter, from South Carolina, had been in Afghanistan for 5 months before the explosion . 'I . honestly believe Kyle made an effort to protect his family and his . fellow marines. I don't think he wanted to see his fellow marines see . him suffer,' Dr Malone said. 'He . knew that his fellow marines would be at some point going off to war . and they might be faced with the same type of challenge. You would never . know what he's been through. All his injuries have become a part of . him, and he's proud of his injuries.’ There has been some debate over . exactly what happened before the explosion, as Carpenter said he was . unable to remember what had happened and there were no witnesses to the . event. But troops have said they have no doubt Carpenter had acted to save his friends life. Hospitalman . 3rd Class Christopher Frend, who was the first to treat the men, said . the injuries were consistent with Carpenter covering the grenade. He added that the part of the grenade that detonated was found beneath Carpenter's torso. Still smiling: He has undergone 30 surgeries, including on his right arm which broke in numerous places . Fighter: Carpenter, 24, lost his right eye and most of his teeth in the blast. He also suffered a shattered jaw . 'Grenade blasts blow up; they don't . blow down,' Frend told Marine Corps Times in 2012. 'If he hadn't done . it, what we found would have looked completely different.' Scars: Carpenter sustained wounds to the right side of his body and now wears a glass eye . Still, the veteran, who had been in . Afghanistan for five months before the blast, previously told the Washington Post that he . wasn't comfortable with wearing the Medal of Honor. 'There . are guys who I was with who didn't come back, so it’s hard for me to . wear this and have the spotlight on me the rest of my life when they . lost their life on a hot, dusty field in Afghanistan and most people . don't even know their names,' he said. 'Even . at Walter Reed, I recovered with quadruple-amputees. How am I supposed . to wear this knowing and seeing all the hardships that are much worse . than mine that guys have gone through without any recognition?' Even though he has since left the . Marines, Carpenter has maintained close ties with them and has been . featured as a guest of honor at several command events. The Marine has also been celebrated . as a hero across the nation - appearing on Katie Couric's show to talk . about his experiences, and garnering thousands of fans on his Facebook . page. Carpenter was a patient at Walter Reed until he . medically retired last July. He is now a student at the University of South Carolina. Still smiling: On Tuesday, Carpenter visited the Nationals Park ahead of a game against the Houston Astros . Patriot: He holds his arm - which is heavily scarred from his injuries - to his chest during the national anthem . 'He . skis, he snowboards, he's jumped from a plane, he's completed the . marine corps marathon, he's a motivational speaker, an advocate for his . fellow wounded warriors,' Obama said. So far in his presidency, Obama has presented the medal of honor to 39 members of the armed services. But Corporal Carpenter is just the third Marine to receive the Medal of Honor since the start of the Afghanistan and war in 2001. Dakota Meyer became the first Marine Medal of Honor recipient from the war in Afghanistan in 2011 and Cpl. Jason Dunham was recognized posthumously for smothering a grenade in Iraq in 2004.","Kyle Carpenter shielded his friend from the blast on a rooftop in the Helmand province in November 2010 - and both men survived .

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott touched down in China’s capital on Sunday night ahead of a series of political meetings with various world leaders on economics, security and the MH17 disaster. Although primarily heading to Beijing for the APEC summit, Mr Abbott is expected to hold a formal meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin who is also in Beijing for the regional meeting. In amongst discussion of tariff cuts and free-trade agreements with APEC leaders, as well as a meeting regarding the war in the Middle East with United States president Barack Obama according to SBS, the Prime Minister plans to discuss the MH17 disaster and fallout with Mr Putin on Tuesday. Prime Minister Tony Abbott  is escorted by Australian Ambassador to China Frances Adamson upon his arrival at Beijing's airport on Sunday night . Abbott is in China to attend the  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 2014 Summit being held in Beijing from 5 to 11 November . 'Australians turned (to us) with an official request for a meeting during an APEC summit and we are agreeing to such a meeting in China,' Putin's top foreign policy adviser Yury Ushakov said. 'It will be short,' he added. Russian backed separatists shot down the plane over east Ukraine on July 17, killing all 298 people aboard including 38 Australians. Mr Abbott has flagged a 'robust conversation' and wants Mr Putin to guarantee he's doing everything possible to help investigations. Vladimir Putin is also expected to arrive at Beijing on Tuesday to discuss the MH17 disaster and fallout with Mr Abbott . Russian President Vladimir Putin (left) and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping (right) shake hands during a signing ceremony in Beijing on November 9 after promising ever closer cooperation . 'The conversation will be, as I have said, about our absolute expectation that Russia will be as good as its word, that it will fully cooperate with the investigations that are under way and that it will do what it can to ensure that justice is done,' Mr Abbott said on Saturday. 'This is not an issue which Russia now expects to be forgotten, that this is not an atrocity which Russia thinks can be swept under the carpet'. The Prime Minister grabbed global headlines after threatening to 'shirtfront' the Russian president but has since toned down his language. Instead, he insisted he would hold robust talks with the Russian president over the country's actions. The Russian leader is also in the Chinese capital to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit leaders' meeting . Mr Abbott waves as he boards the plane to Beijing to attend APEC from Canberra on Sunday . After consulting with other G20 members, Mr Abbott confirmed Mr Putin would not be banned from the economic leaders' summit next week. Mr Abbott said as the G20 is an international organisation which works on consensus, Australia does not have the right to bar any member from attending. Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said the shirtfront comment went too far. Arriving in Beijing on Friday, Mr Abbot is expected to discuss and sign a free-trade agreement with other APEC leaders during the summit . Tough questions need to be asked during Tony Abbott's showdown with Russian President Vladimir Putin . 'In some ways that weakened our legitimate outrage,' he told ABC TV on Sunday. He hopes Mr Abbott uses the meeting as an opportunity to get to the bottom of what happened. 'Putin's not going to tell us the truth,' he said. 'But Tony Abbott has to at least ask.' Mr Abbott grabbed global headlines after pledging to 'shirtfront' Mr Putin during the G20 leader meeting . Mr Abbott has flagged a 'robust conversation' and wants Mr Putin to guarantee he's doing everything possible to help investigations . Australia should be lobbying for peace in Ukraine, as a silver lining to the 'senseless barbarity', Mr Shorten said. Recovery and investigative work at the crash site has been halted because of fighting between the government and pro-Russian separatists, despite a September ceasefire. The APEC summit, which begins on Monday and will focus on economic cooperation, marks the beginning of a whirlwind week of diplomacy for Mr Abbott, who will also visit Myanmar for Asian security talks before returning to Australia to host the G20 in Brisbane.","Tony Abbott and Vladimir Putin will  attend the APEC Summit in Beijing on Monday to discuss free-trade in the region .

"The ceramic poppies at the Tower of London could crack in cold weather, buyers have been warned. To date 888,246 poppies have been planted in the Tower's moat to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the First World War - each one representing a fallen British or Commonwealth soldier. Each poppy was sold for £25 to members of the public by mid-October. Historic Royal Palaces, who have overseen the incredibly popular memorial, said the poppies have to be removed so they can be sent top buyers by January as promised, despite calls for the installation to remain there longer. Scroll down for video . Ceramic poppies at the Tower of London, which have been sold to members of the public for £25. Buyers are being warned not to put them outside until spring because they may crack in extremely cold weather . The installation of over 888,000 red ceramic poppies was created by artist Paul Cummins, each poppy representing a British or colonial fatality during World War One . Now it has emerged that buyers are being warned not to put them outside until spring because they may crack in extremely cold weather, reports the Sunday Times. Despite a public campaign to make the entire display permanent, a team of 8,000 volunteers will begin dismantling and cleaning the flowers on November 12. They will leave two sections, The Wave and The Weeping Window, in place until the end of the month. It will then be displayed across the country in different museums, before being permanently installed at the Imperial War Museum in 2018. Floodlights have already been installed to allow people to visit after dusk. It comes after overwhelming crowds forced the closure of the nearby Tower Hill Station, with Transport for London pleading with tourists to postpone their visits. The individual poppies have been sold for £25 each to raise money for Armed Forces charities. The tour of sections of the artwork will be funded with charitable donations as well as £500,000 from the Government. The Camerons are among millions of people to have visited the site since it was unveiled by Paul Cummins earlier this year . The Prime Minister and his wife walking among the ceramic poppies at the Tower of London yesterday . Politicians pleaded with organisers to keep Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red at the Tower of London permanently following the site's popularity. An estimated 4million people will have viewed the attraction by November 12, prompting an online campaign with more than 20,000 signatures to stop it being dismantled. Adding his weight to the calls, Labour leader Ed Miliband said: ‘I hope that a way can be found to extend this remarkable exhibition, and ensure that many more members of the public get the chance to pay their own personal tributes and see this extraordinary sight.’ London Mayor Boris Johnson is also reportedly in favour of keeping the artwork at the Tower. The politician told the Evening Standard this week: 'I’m keen to explore whether we can keep the exhibition open for longer, to give as many people as possible the chance to glimpse something so incredible, whilst easing the pressure on numbers.' Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, who has not yet visited the attraction, told radio listeners: 'It's really struck a chord, it's extraordinary and very moving to see. 'Let’s maybe keep the display going a bit longer, but not deprive those charities of that much needed money from the sale of the poppies.' Also planting poppies were Chelsea Pensioner Albert Willis, 79, an ex Grenadier Guard alongside a Tower of London Yeoman Warder and a serving Grenadier Guard . Sections of the artwork such as The Wave (pictured) will remain at the Tower of London until the end of the month to allow more visitors . The Weeping Window, a section of the piece with flowers pouring out of one of the tower's historic windows, will remain until December . The poignant tribute is among many pieces of artwork produced to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the beginning of WWI . Floodlights have been installed to allow more people to visit after dusk after overwhelming crowds closed the nearby tube station . The Queen and Prince Phillip visited the artwork in October.

"Brazilian football club Corinthians have decided to give their fans the opportunity to be buried in a graveyard dedicated for their supporters. Sao Paulo-based club Corinthians will open a cemetery in 2015, which will according to the club, have 70,000 plots made available. The 'Corinthians Forever' graveyard will also become the resting place for several top former stars who will be moved to the complex. Fanatical Corinthians fans can now choose to be buried alongside club legends at a new graveyard . Plots will cost between $1,870 (£1,169) and $3,240 (£2,027) depending on the area of the complex selected and proximity to club idols who will also be laid to rest at the site. Corinthians, or Sport Club Corinthians Paulista, are one of the most famous names in Brazilian football, winning five national titles in their 104-year history, one Copa Libertadores and two FIFA Club World Cups. Taking their name from the famous amateur side Corinthian, they were founded in 1910 after the English side blitzed all before them on a tour of Brazil. Late club legends Teleco, left, and Socrates, right. It is not known whether they will be among the 100 figures from Corinthians history to be moved to the new graveyard . The club has had a fair share of legends plying their trade at the 40,000 Pacaembu Stadium. Most notable of all was Socrates. The Brazilian captain from the magical national side of 1982 was in his pomp for Corinthians between 1978 and 1984. He passed away in 2011. The Doctor was inspirational on and off the pitch where he would often take to the field wearing a shirt printed with 'Democracia' in protest at the military government running the country at the time. Before him there was Roberto Rivelino, famed for taking trickery to a new level and having a powerful left-foot shot. The Sao Paulo-based club say up to 70,000 plots will be made available for fans in the 'Corinthians Forever' graveyard which is due to open in 2015 . The attacking midfielder was christened 'King of the Park' by fans after coming through the youth ranks in 1965 and featuring for the next nine years. He infamously played in the shock state final defeat to Palmeiras in 1974 in what turned out to be last game. The fans made him a scapegoat and never forgave him, accusing him of bringing bad luck in an era where the club went without a state trophy between 1954 and 1977. The cemetery will also include function rooms, landscaped gardens, a restaurant and a lake and nature reserve, said Ricardo Polito, chief executive of the company in charge of the construction.","Corinthians will open 'Corinthians Forever' graveyard in 2015 .

"A new species of Frog has been discovered thriving in New York - after scientists were drawn to the creatures' 'very odd' chorus call. The newly-named Atlantic Coast leopard frog was first noticed hopping around wetlands in the shadow of Yankee Stadium in the Bronx. Jeremy Feinberg, a scientist at Rutgers University in New Jersey, was intrigued by the animals' unusual chorus call. Scroll down to hear the frogs' call . Hip to the hoppa: A new species of frog has been discovered living in New York after scientists noticed the animal's unusual chorus call . The frog looks identical to other leopard frogs but Mr Feinberg felt certain it's distinctive 'chuck' call was like nothing he had heard before. So he teamed up with genetics experts, and tests proved him right - the frog was an entirely new species. The new frog has been given the Latin name Rana Kauffeldi in honour of New York wildlife expert Carl Kauffeld, who first suggested there may be an unidentified species of frog in the area in 1937. Sadly, Mr Kauffeld died in 1974 aged 63 before being able to prove his theory, as genetic testing technology was not available at the time. Colonies of the frog have been discovered across New York's five boroughs. It has since been found to inhabit a coastal strech from Connecticut in the north to Virginia and North Carolina in the south . Mr Feinberg told BBC News: 'Frogs have very stereotyped calls within a species, so I knew this was different. 'But it took me two years to find someone to partner with me on the genetics side. 'This is only the third new species of frog to be discovered north of Mexico since 1986 . ""What also makes this crazy is that it's in a urban area - [that's] what makes it a double whammy. ""You wouldn't find it hopping around Times Square"" - . '[These frogs] probably require wetland areas of something on the average minimum of 10 acres or more.

"Officials are investigating how Vice-President Joe Biden took a free family vacation at a luxury government-owned log cabin despite a ban on federal employees using the property for anything other than official purposes. Biden, his wife and 11 other family members spent four nights at the four-bedroom Brinkerhoff Lodge, situated next to a lake close to Mount Moran in the Grand Teton National Park, in August. The idyllic property boasts a two-story living room, a full-length deck, Western-style chandeliers and walls lined with rustic log and pine paneling. Luxury: Joe Biden, his wife and 11 other family members enjoyed a four day stay at the four-bedroom Brinkerhoff Lodge situated next to a lake close to Mount Moran in the Grand Teton National Park this August . During his stay Biden is understood to have conducted no official business, held no meetings and kept no public schedule, suggesting his stay was purely recreational. After Time magazine uncovered documents confirming his stay, the Vice President's office said he intended to reimburse the National Park, which owns and operates Brinkerhoff, to the tune of $1,200. Vacation: Biden is understood to have conducted no official business during his stay at the lodge . But further investigations by Time found the $1,200 figure appeared to assume the lodge was comparable to a single hotel room and would be far below market rate for similar properties, especially during peak season. The magazine also revealed at least four Cabinet secretaries and other officials from President Barack Obama's administration have stayed at the lodge with friends and family in recent years. They include former Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa Jackson, former Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, Education Secretary Arne Duncan, former Secretary of Interior Ken Salazar, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Phil Schiliro and National Park Service Director Jon Jarvis. LaHood, who spent eight nights at Brinkerhoff with his wife, his daughter-in-law, three grandchildren, two other adults and his son, in 2012, was said to have attended a Department of Transportation grant award event. Duncan, who enjoyed six nights there with his wife and children in 2013, attended a nearby roundtable with Native American tribal leaders and an event at a local school. Jarvis was said to have official business on just two of the five days he spent there in August 2012. The others are yet to disclose whether any official bussiness was conducted during their visits. Yesterday the Interior Department said it was launching an investigation into how the park service has managed the Brinkerhoff. A spokesman told Time: 'In light of inconsistencies in billing practices and ambiguity in the policy at the park, the Interior Department has directed the National Park Service to conduct an immediate review of compliance with the policy and related recordkeeping and to seek reimbursement, where appropriate, for use of the Brinkerhoff.' Reimbursement: Biden, pictured with wife Jill, has reportedly now offered to pay $1,200 for his stay at the lodge . The cabin was built in 1947 by the family of oil magnate Zachary Brinkerhoff, before being acquired by the National Park Service in the 1950s. It was subsequently  made available as VIP accommodation to presidents, members of Congress and government bureaucrats to use for vacations. But following a public outcry a policy was adopted in 1992 banning its use for purely recreational activities.","Biden and 12  family members spent four nights at idyllic Brinkerhoff Lodge .

In the 2012 game Call of Duty Black Ops II, Noriega is seen shooting his own soldiers at random and helping the CIA capture a Nicaraguan drug lord before switching sides. He also is referred to in the game as 'old pineapple face' which is an actual nickname used by Panamanians. Likeness: Former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega as depicted in the Call of Duty Black Ops II game, left, and during his time in power, right . The 80-year-old,   currently serving a jail sentence in Panama for crimes  including murder, filed the suit from prison  claiming he is portrayed as 'a kidnapper, murderer and enemy of the state'. He  filed suit in July claiming Call of Duty's maker Activision had infringed his right to his own publicity, and sought unspecified damages. Noriega said in court documents that he was unaware that his image was being used in the game until his grandchildren played it and asked him about it. But Judge William Fahey of Los Angeles Superior Court dismissed the suit and granted  Activision's special motion to strike the case under a . California statute that seeks to prevent lawsuits stifling free . speech. Fiction: Noriega is portrayed is seen in the game shooting his own soldiers at random and helping the CIA capture a Nicaraguan drug lord . Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who represented Activision said: 'This was an absurd lawsuit from the very beginning and we're gratified that in the end, a notorious criminal didn't win.' Mr Giuliani had argued that Noriega's status as a public figure in the 1980s prevented him from suing over his inclusion in the game which earned more than $1 billion in sales within 15 days of its release. Rudy Giuliani, who represented Activision, described the lawsuit as 'absurd' Activision which has featured historical figures such as President John F. Kennedy and Fidel Castro in previous 'Call of Duty' games said the use of the character was protected under the right to free speech. Judge Fahey agreed saying: 'Given the world-wide reporting of his actions in the 1980s and early 1990s, it is hard to imagine that any such evidence exists.' He said Noriega's right of publicity was outweighed by the defendants' First Amendment right to free expression, and that there was no evidence of harm to Noriega's reputation. Activision had warned that if Noriega prevailed, it would have a chilling effect on movies and works of art that portray historical and political figures. 'Today's ruling is a victory for the 40 million dedicated members of our ""Call of Duty"" community and global audiences who enjoy historical fiction across all works of art,' Bobby Kotick, Activision Blizzard's CEO wrote in a statement. Noriega was the military dictator of Panama from 1983 to 1989 when he was toppled  by a U.S. invasion. He served a 17-year drug trafficking sentence in the United States. The part of the game in which he helps capture the drug lord is thought to refer to a time in the 1980s when he was a paid CIA informant. Following his release in 2010 he was . extradited to France to serve a sentence there. France then sent . him to Panama, where he remains in prison for crimes committed . during his rule. He has had health issues in recent months and has been treated for high blood pressure, flu and bronchitis. His family said he has a benign brain tumor and heart trouble. Noriega is not the only public figure to sue a video game company. Actress Lindsay Lohan has filed a lawsuit against the creators of Grand Theft Auto V arguing they used her image for a character named Lacey Jonas without her permission. Actress Lindsay Lohan has filed a lawsuit against the creators of Grand Theft Auto V arguing they used her image for a character named Lacey Jonas without her permission. The star's lookalike alter-ego parties at infamous celebrity haunt, the Hotel Chateau Marmont in West Hollywood, 'a place where the plaintiff once lived and often frequents', according to the case documents. The legal papers claim the 'game features a mission where the plaintiff's look-alike asks another character to take her home and escape the paparazzi' and features a character sporting the same ' likeness, clothing, outfits, clothing line products, ensemble in the form of hats, hair style, sunglasses, jean shorts worn by [Lohan]...before the release of the GTA V video game.'

"An upstate New York school has cancelled its varsity football team's season following a hazing incident in which players rubbed their genitals into teammates' faces.

"HSBC director Laura Cha was quoted as making the comments at an event in Paris . A boss at HSBC bank has sparked fury among pro-democracy campaigners in Hong Kong by suggesting they should wait to get the right to vote like slaves in the United States had to do. Laura Cha, who is a Director at the British-owned bank and sits on their Conduct and Values Committee, was quoted as making the comments at an event in Paris. 'American slaves were liberated in 1861 but did not get voting rights until 107 years later. So why can't Hong Kong wait for a while?' the Standard newspaper on Thursday quoted Cha as saying. Cha said democracy could not be reached in just one step and warned that investors' confidence in Hong Kong was at a critical point, the newspaper added. Thousands have since signed an online petition denouncing her comments and demanding an apology. Cha, who is  a member of Hong Kong's policy-making Executive Council, chairwoman of the city's Financial Services Development Council and a member of China's parliament, said in a statement that she meant every country's path to democracy was evolved in its own historical context. She added she did not mean any disrespect and was sorry her comments had caused concern. HSBC's Asia-Pacific chief Peter Wong said he had noticed the speech from Cha but that he would stick to the bank's principle and 'refrain from commenting on political items and issues'. The Financial Services Development Council did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The comments triggered outrage on social media and nearly 6,000 people had signed the petition by Friday evening. The web site of the petition said it had been launched by Jeffrey Chan from Hong Kong. It only appeared to be in English. Protests: For more than a month, key roads leading into three of Hong Kong's most economically and politically important districts have been barricaded with wood and steel by thousands of protesters . 'We, the Hong Kong public, will not stand these remarks likening our rights to slavery, nor will we stand the kind of voter disenfranchisement her and her associates attempt to perpetrate on the Hong Kong public,' said the petition to HSBC, that sought an apology from Cha. The petition is addressed to the HSBC board of directors and is signed 'The People of Hong Kong'. China has ruled Hong Kong since 1997 through a 'one country, two systems' formula which allows wide-ranging autonomy and freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland and specifies universal suffrage as an eventual goal. But Beijing said in August it would screen candidates who want to run for the city's election for a chief executive in 2017, which democracy activists said rendered the notion of universal suffrage meaningless. Pro-democracy protesters sit on a barricade in the occupied area of the Mong Kok district of Hong Kong,this week . For more than a month, key roads leading into three of Hong Kong's most economically and politically important districts have been barricaded with wood and steel by thousands of protesters. The protests drew well over 100,000 at their peak. Hundreds of demonstrators remained at the main protest site in Admiralty district close to government buildings on Friday night, some dressed in Halloween costumes. A  Kim Jong-Un impersonator flashes the v sign to the crowd in Hong Kong today . The highlight was an impersonator of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who showed up to support the protesters. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, which was established in 1865 to finance growing trade between Europe, India and China, has for decades been the most prominent retail and commercial bank in Hong Kong, using the city as a bedrock for its global expansion. HSBC has the largest branch network in mainland China of a foreign bank. The controversy is the latest to drag HSBC into Hong Kong politics. Earlier this year, Next Media said HSBC and Standard Chartered PLC had pulled millions of dollars worth of advertisements from Apple Daily after they were pressured by Beijing. Apple Daily is owned by media magnate Jimmy Lai, an outspoken critic of Beijing who has supported pro-democracy activists through his publications and with donations. HSBC and Standard Chartered have said the decision to pull the advertising was for commercial reasons. Cha's comments came just days after Hong Kong leader Leung Chun-ying triggered a wave of criticism when he said that free elections were unacceptable partly because they risked giving Hong Kong's poor and working class a dominant voice. Financial Secretary John Tsang is due to visit Beijing on Monday to discuss issues of mutual concern, the Hong Kong government said late on Friday.","HSBC director Laura Cha made the offensive comments at an event in Paris .

"A 16-year-old girl killed a 12-year-old boy after reversing into him while taking her first driving lesson with her father. Police said the unlicensed girl had been learning basic driving skills  in the driveway of their home in Lewisville, Texas. Her father had reportedly given her permission to start the engine before she lost control of the vehicle. Tragedy: Eric Lozano, 12, was killed when he was hit by a car being driven by a 16-year-old girl who was having her first driving lesson . The car accelerated  out of the driveway and careered across the road before hitting Eric Lozano and crushing him against a house. A number of other children are understood to have witnessed the incident which happened on Friday evening last week. A 10-year-old who was also hit by the car escaped with only minor injuries. One of the victim's friends Luis Alvarez told CBS DFW: 'I didn’t believe it would end like this. 'It’s hard for us, his friends, especially the ones who saw everything.' Teddy bears, candles and letters have been left at a memorial at the spot where Eric was killed. His uncle Brandon Brown described him as a happy child who loved to play with his friends. Mr Brown said Eric 'Loved to play sports, ride skateboard, go fishing, loved his mom, his brother. You know, just a normal 12-year-old boy.' Yesterday police said they were still gathering evidence and were not yet prepared to comment on the incident. The boy's mother is currently in hospital suffering from exhaustion and fatigue. His aunt Erica Mendez believes legal action should be taken against the 16-year-old driver. She said: 'There’s been nothing, and something has to be done, legally. 'The child should have not been behind the wheel getting taught how to drive in a neighborhood where there’s kids everywhere running around and playing'. A Go Fund Me page set up by the family to help with funeral costs has so far raised over $12,000.","Eric Lozano died at the scene after being hit by the unlicensed driver .

Court documents state that the youngster had been pretending to shoot Hawk with a toy gun as he ran around his home in Ninepipes, Montana. Hawk  pointed a real gun at the boy in response and it went off. Arrest: Galen Hawk, 26, is facing up to 20 years in prison after being charged with negligent homicide following the tragic death of Lonato Moran-Allen on Wednesday last week .

Following the shooting, Hawk attempted to perform CPR on the boy before driving him to a hospital in Ronan where he  later died. The little boy was due to celebrate his fourth birthday on November 10. Hawk appeared in court on Friday where he was charged with negligent homicide. Bail has been set at $100,000. Lake County Deputy Attorney James Lapotka showed the court a gun similar to the one Hawk used to shoot the boy. He said, 'He chose to take a handgun, similar to this one.

"Ugly scenes marred the San Francisco Giants' triumph in baseball's World Series  last night as rowdy fans brawled in the streets, setting fires, hurling bottles and letting off fireworks.

On the field Madison Bumgarner pitched five innings of near-perfect relief and the San Francisco Giants held off the Kansas City Royals 3-2 Wednesday night in Game 7 of the World Series for their third championship in five seasons. With both starters chased early, this became a matchup of bullpens. And no one stood taller than the 6-foot-5 Bumgarner, who added to his postseason legacy with a third victory this Series.

The Giants ended a Series streak that had seen home teams win the last nine Game 7s. San Francisco took this pairing of wild-card teams after earning titles in 2012 and 2010. Pitching on two days' rest after his shutout in Game 5, Bumgarner entered in the fifth with a 3-2 lead. After giving up a leadoff single to Omar Infante, he shut down the Royals until Gordon's hit. Neither manager wanted to be caught waiting too long to make a move and Bruce Bochy pulled Tim Hudson in the second. Jeremy Affeldt relieved and threw 2 1-3 scoreless innings in his longest stint since 2012. Giants designated hitter Michael Morse drove in two runs, including a go-ahead single in the fourth off Kelvin Herrera. A moment earlier, Royals manager Ned Yost had yanked starter Jeremy Guthrie.

Along with pulling Hudson, Bochy became the first manager to win a video review challenge under Major League Baseball's expanded replay format. Eric Hosmer was initially ruled safe by first base umpire Eric Cooper while making a headfirst dive to beat out a double-play relay in the third. But after a review that took 2 minutes, 57 seconds, Hosmer was called out, completing a slick play started by rookie second baseman Joe Panik's dive and glove flip to shortstop Brandon Crawford.

The crowd noise at Kauffman Stadium was constant and loud. The fans cheered when Billy Butler singled and hustled home on a double by Gordon, and booed when Perez was hit in the leg and knocked to the dirt — that all happened in a span of three pitches. Small ball was the story early, with three sacrifice flies in the second inning alone. Morse drove in Sandoval with the bases loaded and no outs, and Crawford drove in Hunter Pence with another fly to make it 2-0. The Royals rallied back fast. After Infante's sacrifice fly tied it at 2, Alcides Escobar singled with two outs and that was all for Hudson. At 39, Hudson was the oldest pitcher to start Game 7 in the Series. He had signed with the Giants in the offseason as a free agent, hoping to reach the World Series for the first time, and maybe win a championship. This was his chance and instead, he had the shortest start in Game 7 of a Series since Bob Turley of the Yankees lasted only one inning against Pittsburgh in 1960. Before the game, something happened that caught the attention of both teams. As the Royals were taking batting practice and the Giants were stretching beyond their dugout, a person wearing white formal gloves, and accompanied by a security guard, carried the gleaming, gold-and-silver World Series trophy across the grass behind the cage. The prize was probably headed to a safe spot, waiting to be presented to the winner. Players on both sides watched the procession and some pointed, but no one dared jinx themselves by touching it. Greetings: San Francisco Giants' Hunter Pence is seen on the field after the big win . Upset: At least one Royals fan in the crowd was dressed for Halloween . Royals great George Brett, now a team executive, wandered over to a cluster of Giants and greeted some of them. Pence smiled and seemed to enjoy the moment. Among those watching from near the backstop was Jack Morris. Hard to think about a Game 7 and not remember him. Morris gave one of the greatest pitching performances of all-time, throwing a 10-hit shutout in 1991 to lead Minnesota over Atlanta 1-0 at the Metrodome. 'Game 7s don't come around very often. We're all hoping for them,' said Morris, now a broadcaster. When his time came, Morris was prepared. 'I knew what it meant, and I was ready to pitch,' he said. 'I wasn't nervous. I was confident.' 'That's how it should be. Every fielder should want the ball. Every hitter should want to be at the plate,' he said. Bret Saberhagen, who pitched a Game 7 shutout in 1985 to give Kansas City its only crown, threw out the first ball. Soon after, the game began after another stumble with the national anthem. Opera star and longtime Royals fan Joyce DiDonato did fine singing 'The Star-Spangled Banner,' but tripped and fell in the batter's box while walking off the field. Before Game 5 in San Francisco, county singer Aaron Lewis messed up the lyrics to the anthem and later apologized for the mistake.

"Relatives of British tourists in Nepal face an anxious wait for news of their loved ones amid conflicting reports over exactly how many remain missing following the avalanche that killed at least 40 people. As Nepalese search and rescue teams scaled back the hunt for survivors today it is understood that at least five British tourists known to be in Nepal remain unaccounted for. However a spokesman for the Trekking Agencies' Association of Nepal said he did not believe there were any more missing tourists although they were still looking for several local porters and tour guides. A Nepalese Army helicopter rescues survivors along the Annapurna trail. There have been conflicting reports over exactly how many remain missing following the avalanche that killed at least 40 people . A British newspaper reported this morning that up to 40 Britons could still be missing on the popular hiking trail around Annapurna, the world's tenth highest peak. Online lists set up through social media  to help track down those tourists who have not been heard from since the devastating storm six days ago appear to have added to the confusion. Today British nationals Peter Roddis and Andy Kimmerling were still being listed as missing on one website despite the fact they had contacted relatives over the weekend to report they were safe and well. Others listed are known not to have been in the Annapurna trail but in other regions of Nepal. Fears remain for  Britons Martin Warner, Katie Hill and Jay Devine who were in the area and are still unaccounted for. Several others whose names appeared on that list have since contacted home to say they are safe and well – and, in some cases, that they were not near the disaster scene. Jade House, from Liphook, Hampshire and her boyfriend Oliver De Paolis, from London, both 24, contacted their families to say they had been in another part of the Himalayas when disaster struck. Nigel Vardy, 46, of Belper, Derbyshire – known as Mr Frostbite after losing his fingers on a previous adventure – has also contacted his family to say he is safe. Safe: Jade House (right) and her boyfriend Oliver De Paolis (left), both 24, contacted their families to say they had been in another part of the Himalayas when disaster struck . Unharmed: Peter Roddis, 26, an electrical engineer, from Hove, East Sussex, has contacted his family to say he was not in the mountains when disaster struck . Yesterday Briton Andrew Kimmerling, 54, who was on honeymoon in Nepal with his Danish wife Suzanne and had been feared dead, turned up safe and well. Management consultant Mr Kimmerling, who moved to France 15 years ago from Cambridgeshire, contacted relatives by text and phone call to say that he and his wife are both fine. Peter Roddis, 26,  from Hove, East Sussex, has contacted his family to say he was not in the mountains when disaster struck on the 150-mile trail, which loops round Annapurna, the world's tenth tallest peak. The electrical engineer even contacted his local newspaper to thank them for describing him as an ‘adventurer’- because it made him 'sound cool'. Girlfriend Lisa Hallett said: 'Thankfully, Peter is safe and well and was not in danger at any point. There was a lot of confusion.' The Annapurna trail is around 150 miles long and much of the area does not have phone coverage meaning some trekkers simply may not have been able to check in with friends and relatives. 'Today is the last day of the search and rescue operation,' said Keshav Pandey of the Trekking Agencies' Association of Nepal. 'After this we can only hope that those who are missing will establish contact with us or their families. 'We don't think that any tourist is missing now. I am getting reports that some local porters and tour guides who were on the trek have not been traced so far.' Safe: Yesterday Briton Andrew Kimmerling (left), feared dead, turned up well, along with Nigel Vardy, 46, of Belper, Derbyshire, known as Mr Frostbite after losing his fingers on a previous adventure . Small avalanches have today hampered the search for the remaining Nepali porters and guides missing for six days after a devastating Himalayan storm. Nearly 600 people have been rescued from the popular hiking trail around Annapurna, the world's tenth highest peak, after it was hit by unseasonable snow and avalanches brought by the tail end of a cyclone that swept through neighbouring India. The dead include Canadian, Indian, Israeli, Japanese, Nepalese, Polish and Slovak trekkers. Survivors said many people perished trying to descend in freezing whiteout conditions from the highest pass of the 240-km (150-mile) trail around Annapurna, which offers dramatic views of crags and hamlets. Searchers retrieved another body on Monday, taking the tally of deaths to 40. 'Army rescuers dug out the body of an Israeli tourist from snow today,' Baburam Bhandari, chief of Nepal's Mustang district, one of the worst hit, told Reuters. Survivors of the tragedy told yesterday how they faced the life or death dilemma of whether to stay in a flimsy teahouse at 17,000ft or brave a killer blizzard. Around 100 people, including many inexperienced trekkers, took refuge in the wooden shack after a sudden snowstorm on the popular Annapurna Circuit. The teahouse's owner told trekkers they were putting their lives in danger if they stayed. He then declared he was shutting the shop near the Thorung La Pass and, it is claimed, demanded 1,000 Nepali rupees – around £6.30 – each to guide them to the nearest village, Muktinath. Some decided to stay behind after he agreed to leave the lodge open and, despite a cold and hungry night, survived. But most set off behind him and several died – amid claims he abandoned them when the deadly blizzards and avalanches took hold last week. Yesterday Kobi Megreli, 24, an Israeli medical student who was among those who opted to stay in the teahouse, said: 'I don't trust someone who asks me for money to save my life. 'My friends who went with him told me the owner had left them halfway down. In the snow. In the storm. He left them because they were too exhausted to continue.' The search for survivors of the devastating storm in which at least 39 people died was called off by rescuers in Nepal yesterday as they began focusing instead on looking for bodies trapped in the snow. The Foreign Office said yesterday that it has still received no information about any British injured or dead. Message: Briton Lizi Hamer,  left, and her New Zealand born wife Lisa, posted this picture on Facebook to assure friends and relatives they are safe and well . Mr Megreli told The Sunday Times of the terrible dilemma in the teahouse after he was discharged from a hospital in Kathmandu, the Nepalese capital, with only minor injuries. He and the others who refused to pay to be led down the mountain made it to safety the next morning after 'huddling together for warmth' and not sleeping for fear of hypothermia. They walked to an area where military helicopters flew them to Kathmandu. Eitan Edan, 31, an Israeli social worker who followed the teahouse owner but survived and is being treated for frostbite, said: 'They let us think we had to walk if we wanted to stay alive, but everyone who stayed in the teashop lived.' Four of his friends died, he added. The fate of the teahouse owner was not clear last night. Reports locally said Pasang Tamang, a porter who had earlier been hired by some of those in the teahouse to help them on the trek, was hailed a hero after dying having rescued more than 20 stranded people during the descent. But some survivors have claimed the 45-year-old father of two, who was reportedly paid £9 a day, made a deal with the teahouse owner to share the trekkers' 'escape payments'. He died of suffocation and exhaustion during the descent. His employer, Laxman Ghimire, said 22,500 rupees (£141) and $100 was recovered from his body, which he had earned on his previous trek. British police sergeant Paul Sherridan helped over 100 trekkers down the mountain . A British policeman who was hailed a hero after leading more than 100 trekkers to safety during the Nepal avalanche disaster has joked how his wife threatened to kill him when he got home. Sergeant Paul Sherridan, 49, was praised for keeping a cool head when he found himself in white-out conditions in the Annapurna range last week. Only after he began helping a small party back to safety did he realise that dozens of stranded and freezing walkers were also following him down. Speaking at a press conference in Sheffield today he said: 'I rang my wife Lesley and said there’s been a bit of an incident in Nepal and you might hear about it in the news. I might have used up one of my nine lives. 'She said ""you wait till you get home here, you might lose the other eight"".' Sergeant Sherridan, from Doncaster, put his success down to his calm exterior which helped others stay positive, . He added: 'I was a swan sitting on top of the water but underneath my feet were kicking and going mad. 'Throughout my time as a police officer I have been trained in leading groups in mountainous conditions. 'I had a sense that if I didn’t move I would die. We started to move together and it became apparent we were descending into worse conditions. Everything was featureless and the wind was so ferocious nothing could be heard - imagine having a hairdryer bellowing into your ears. 'I didn’t know if we were going up or down, right or left. The longer I waited I was going to get hypothermia. I realised these people were dropping off one by one. The officer told how he found a Nepalese guide and asked him to try and identify distinguishable landmarks to help them find their way to safety. 'He was the only person who could help us. I said to him: ""I want you to look around the greyness and blackness see if you can recognise anything"". 'We saw a pole and I realised that was going to be the way. I said to everyone: ""make sure you can see the person in front of you and the person behind"" - so we moved to the pole and with each navigation point we moved further down the mountain. 'I turned around and there was 100 plus people just coming down the mountain. I realised it was not just me and a few other people - there were a lot more.'","At least five British tourists still remain unaccounted for .

"Dignitaries gathered on Flanders Fields today for the unveiling of a monument to the famous Christmas Truce football matches between British and German soldiers during the First World War. Football Association chairman Greg Dyke joined Uefa president Michel Platini and national and local political figures for the unveiling of the football-themed monument. A century ago on Christmas Day, German and British enemies left their trenches and headed into No Man's Land in a few scattered locations on the Western Front for an unofficial truce.

The event was a tribute to the German and British soldiers who left their trenches and headed into No Man's Land  for an unofficial truce on Christmas Day a century ago. Pictured are re-enactors during the ceremony . Chris Barker, a 10th Essex Regiment Great War Living History Group member, is pictured at the UEFA football monument in Ploegsteert, Belgium .

Poignant: Wreaths and footballs and football-related mementoes lie next to the monument . They shared greetings, treats, mementoes and a game of football during the unofficial ceasefire. Germans placed trees illuminated with candles on the parapet of their trenches and sang Christmas carols as the war raged on nearby. Troops from both camps were able to bury their dead who had fallen in No Man's Land, repair their trenches and share cigars during the temporary ceasefire. For those involved, it was most of all a yearning for a sense of normality, however momentarily, that pushed them over the edge of their trenches, unarmed. 'Suddenly a Tommy came with a football,' wrote Lieutenant Johannes Niemann of Germany, referring to a British soldier. 'Teams were quickly established for a match on the frozen mud, and the Fritzes beat the Tommies 3-2.' If not fully-fledged matches, other soldier's diaries and various reports also spoke of balls being kicked about in friendship. 'A huge crowd was between the trenches. Someone produced a little rubber ball so of course a football match started,' wrote Lieutenant Charles Brockbank of the British Cheshire Regiment in his diary, which is part of 'The Greater Game' exhibit at the National Football Museum in Manchester. The proponents of the sport have cherished that day as historic proof that there is little that can better bridge man's differences than football.

Mr Platini, right, watches young children leave footballs and other mementos at a newly unveiled monument . Despite fraternisation with the enemy being punishable, the truce was maintained into January 1915, with many testimonies of the lull reported in letters by soldiers to their families. Soldiers ignored war and celebrated Christmas in peace along several places on the front line, including at Ploegsteert Wood, Comines-Warneton, known as Plugstreet to the British. In Ploegsteert, Mr Platini addressed a remembrance ceremony before inaugurating a monument in a muddy field at Warneton alongside local mayor Gilbert Deleu. Platini said: 'This remembrance ceremony pays tribute to the soldiers who expressed, a hundred years ago, their humanity by playing football together. 'They have opened an important chapter in the construction of the European community and gave example for today's young generations.' Christmas truce: German and British soldiers stand together on the battlefield near Ploegsteert, Belgium, in December 1914. Today Uefa president Michael Platini will unveil a monument to the unofficial truce, which was marked by friendly football matches and kickabouts between the sides on the Western Front battlefields . It is hoped the inauguration of the monument, close to British and German trenches, will remind young generations of the major role sport has played in the world's history. Eckart Cuntz, Germany's ambassador to Belgium, said: 'The message from here was that human beings, if they want to stop killing each other, they can do it. 'Of course, the superiors didn't like it but on some places of the front, (the truce) lasted until even the new year.' He added: 'Those who were called the enemies, sometimes monsters, they were human beings. Celebrating Christmas together, singing Silent Night, and after that, here in Ploegsteert, it was a British soldier who had as a Christmas gift a football and suggested a football . Until now, this unique event had been marked by nothing more than a simple wooden cross on the side of a windswept field filled with scorpion weed. At its base, amid wreaths of poppies, lie a smattering of balls and various club pennants, all in remembrance of the Christmas Truce of 1914. Lest we forget: Footballs and other mementoes lie beneath the 'Christmas Truce' cross in St Yvon, Belgium, which was erected in 1999 to remember the football matches played in the no man's land of northern Europe . 'Someone produced a little rubber ball so of course a football match started': The diary of First World War soldier Lieutenant Charles Brockbank, in which he details a football game that took place during the truce . Re-enactors in First World War uniforms kick a football around during half time of a Christmas Truce match in August between British team Newark Town FC and German team Emmendingen in Messines, Belgium . The war had begun on August 4 when the German invasion of Belgium kicked off a series of events which quickly pit the German and Austro-Hungarian empires against Britain, France, Russia and several allies. Germany swept into most of Belgium and northern France and even threatened Paris before the frontline was settled. Armies entrenched themselves for most of the next four years. At the time, though, the prevailing expectation on both sides had been to be home for Christmas. When that didn't happen, an early sense of euphoria quickly made way for unrelenting gloom. It set the stage for the Christmas truce and those magic kickabouts. Football players themselves had been involved in the fighting from the early days. Of the 5,000 professional players at the time, about 2,000 joined the armed forces. Sometimes whole line-ups signed up at the same time to create what became known as the Footballers' Battalions. Peace Game: An organiser holds a period-style football prior to the start of the Christmas Truce Peace Game football match in Belgium in August . London club Clapton Orient, now known as Leyton Orient, alone had about 40 players and staff joining the war effort, all following the steps of their team captain. Scotland's top team at the time, Edinburgh club Hearts, had its whole team join the British army one month ahead of that Christmas, a move which inspired others to join, Peter Francis of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission said. Christmas truce or not, seven members of that team were killed in the war. One of the first footballers killed in the war was Larrett Roebuck, a Huddersfield defender. After playing for his team in a 1-0 victory at Leicester Fosse early in the 1914-15 season, he left for the Western Front and was killed in action on the eve of the first Battle for Ypres, a few miles from that patch of land in Ploegsteert. 'The story is that he set off running across the field with the machine guns going,' said Roebuck's grandson, Frank Wood. 'His friend saw him go down but he couldn't stop to help him. With the fight like that, you couldn't stop.' In the week leading up to today's event, teams posed for combined photographs ahead of matches as part of Football Remembers to mark the truce. The Football Remembers programme is being carried out by the Premier League, the FA, the Football League and British Council and includes work with schools across the UK. Ken Skates, Wales's deputy minister for culture, sport and tourism, said: 'A century ago when war was so frequent, something magical happened. 'Through Christmas spirit, the sound of war was silenced and soldiers from opposing sides laid down their weapons and exchanged photographs and gifts. 'One of the most remarkable moments in our history was united by a common interest - in football.' Tomorrow the Duke of Cambridge will attend the Football Remembers Memorial dedication honouring the Christmas story at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire. William, the FA's president, chose the design for the memorial, by 10-year-old Spencer Turner from Newcastle, with England and Arsenal player Theo Walcott. Next week, British Army footballers will take on their German counterparts in a match called the Game of Truce at Aldershot Town's stadium in Hampshire - a town with close military links. Research released by the British Council this year found that the Christmas truce was one of the most recognised moments of the First World War, with more than two-thirds of UK adults aware of it. Memories of the truce have recently been revived in the Sainsbury's Christmas television advert in which a moment of friendship is shared between a British soldier and a German. The Prime Minister today met with a group of young footballers before they travelled to Belgium to play a match at Ypres. The youngsters and Premier League representatives met David Cameron outside his home at Number 10 Downing Street early this morning. Mr Cameron brandished a period-style leather football as he spoke with the youngsters at the door to Number 10, before the players lined up for a group photo.","On Christmas Day 1914, British and German soldiers held unofficial truce .

"Police chiefs appealed for calm today after sales-crazed shoppers sparked a wave of Black Friday disorder and violence. Bargain hunters were accused of behaving like animals as they grappled over computers, coffee machines, hair-dryers and games consoles. In extraordinary scenes, men and women of all ages fought to secure deals in the sales frenzy imported from the US. Scroll down for video . Tug of war: A woman fights desperately to cling on to a widescreen TV in London as other shoppers try to wrestle it from her. A staff member from Asda can be seen intervening . Tugs of war broke out over TVs and shoppers resorted to lying on top of goods to stop them being snatched by rivals. Police and paramedics were called in to deal with mayhem and injuries at Tesco and Asda stores. At least three arrests were made. There were fears the disorder will continue today and into Monday as retailers roll out more offers. The Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police said the appalling scenes yesterday were ‘totally predictable’. Sir Peter Fahy added: ‘I’m disappointed stores did not have sufficient security staff on duty. This created situations where we had to deal with crushing, disorder and disputes between customers. ‘It does not help that this was in the early hours when police resources are already stretched. 'Across Greater Manchester large supermarkets already make significant demands on policing through calls to shoplifting, anti-social behaviour and thefts of fuel from their petrol stations – much of which is preventable. Scrum down: Customers push each other out of the way as the crowd surges towards widescreen televisions at the Asda store in Wembley . Tensions: A bitter argument erupts among Wembley shoppers as shoppers are accused of behaving like animals during the Black Friday discounts . To me, to you: People struggle to carry their purchases as they make their way to the checkouts in Newcastle . 'We just ask these stores to work with us to reduce the demands on policing and reduce the risks of disorder and crime.’ A post on the Manchester force’s Twitter feed read: ‘Keep calm, people!’ Its officers made two arrests for public order offences and another for an alleged assault. The force said it would not be deploying extra officers to stores. Record numbers of shoppers are expected on high streets today and Visa predicts online sales will top £518million – the highest daily figure ever. Retailers, especially supermarkets, fuelled the Black Friday frenzy with reductions of up to 70 per cent – attracting huge crowds when they opened their doors just after midnight. The Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police, Sir Peter Fahy (pictured), said the appalling scenes yesterday were ‘totally predictable’ Race is on: Customers rush towards cut-price electricals in Leeds where television prices had been cut down . But stock was limited, which meant items quickly sold out and tempers snapped. Paul Marshall, a sergeant in the Metropolitan Police, wrote on Twitter: ‘Even on Black Friday shoving people to the floor so you can get £20 off a coffee maker is still an assault.’ Timed to follow Thanksgiving, Black Friday is an all-American tradition marking the beginning of the Christmas shopping rush. US stores have made the day a huge festive occasion, promising heavy short-term discounts to create excitement and queues outside shops. But the event has been marred in recent years by aggression among shoppers battling for bargains. Last year, an 11-year-old girl was taken to hospital after being trampled by a crowd in New Boston, Ohio. In 2008, a Walmart worker died after being crushed by frenzied customers at a Long Island store. It is thought Black Friday, first brought to the UK in 2008 by Amazon, was so named as it is the day retailers go ‘into the black’ financially. Police were called to at least 14 stores across Greater Manchester, London, Wales and Scotland. The angry scenes were repeated in many other parts of the country and some stores were forced to shut. Tesco refused to say how many of its stores had to call for help, but it defended its handling of the crowds. A spokesman said: ‘All stores were individually assessed prior to Black Friday. We had colleagues on hand, but in a small number of stores the demand exceeded expectations and we asked police for help to manage the safety of the crowds. We are very grateful to the police for their support.’ Asda said that it had to call police to a single store, in Clapham, south London. The leader of the shopworkers’ union, USDAW, pleaded with consumers to spare a thought for those behind the tills. John Hannett said: ‘Retail staff are keen to give great customer service and are trained to provide a good shopping experience, but that can be difficult if people are angry and aggressive.’ Customers who tried to avoid the queues by shopping online had their own problems. Traffic to some chains – such as Tesco Direct, Argos and Currys – was so heavy that their websites froze. The girls who cheered things up: US-style cheerleaders were stationed in the Wembley Asda to drum up some excitement - not that it was needed!","Police have appealed for calm after bargain hunters 'acted like animals'

"Watchdogs have launched an inquiry into the rip-off cost of watching live Premier League football on television, which can be more than £600 a year. The move could cut monthly subscriptions and lead to a dramatic increase in the number of games that are shown live on TV. However, this would involve reducing the number of matches that kick-off at 3pm on a Saturday afternoon in order to fit the live games into the TV schedules. Watchdogs have launched an inquiry into the rip-off cost of watching live Premier League football on television.  Pictured: March is shown between Liverpool and Chelsea . Any shake-up would mean that more games are played on Friday and Monday evenings, while there would be staggered kick-off times during Saturday and Sunday. The TV regulator Ofcom is to consult with fans, including the Football Supporters’ Federation, to see what they would think about sacrificing 3pm kick-offs to allow more live games on TV. The inquiry follows a complaint from pay TV and broadband company Virgin Media, which claims the way the Premier League sells the rights to top flight matches means armchair fans in the UK are hit with unfair fees. The net result is that clubs like Manchester United, Chelsea and Manchester City are sharing in billions of pounds from fans whose passion and loyalty is being abused. Currently only 41per cent of Premier League games – 154 out of 380 – are broadcast live in a season. It is claimed this system of rationing leads to higher prices for armchair fans. By contrast all games played in the top leagues on Spain, Germany, France and Italy are broadcast live. The move could cut monthly subscriptions and lead to a dramatic increase in the number of games that are shown live on TV. Pictured: Everton V Newcastle is aired on Sky TV . Virgin calculates that the minimum monthly cost of watching live Premier League games on the sports channels of Sky and BT comes in at £51. That works out at £612 a year, which is more than four times higher than the BBC licence fee of £145.50, which covers all of its many TV and radio channels, including Match of the Day. The £51 figure is much higher than the £21 month charge football fans in Germany must pay to see top flight teams such as the Bayern Munich and Dortmund in the Bundesliga. It is also more than double the £25 charged in Italy to watch Serie A, and compares to £18 in Spain to follow Barcelona and Real Madrid and just £10 a month in France. Research commissioned by Virgin found more than 15per cent of viewers say they could not watch the games they wanted through their TV provider, while 25per cent found that games were not included in their pay TV subscription. Jamie Carragher (centre) and Gary Neville (right) work on Sky Sports' popular Monday Night Football show, during which more matches could be aired if changes are made . Virgin argues that the way the Premier League packages and sells the TV rights to football in this country works to artificially inflate the price. As a result, the cost of Premier League domestic live TV rights increased by 70per cent to a staggering £3 billion over three years in the last auction. It is predicted to rise by a further 60per cent when they are sold next time. It also means there is absolutely no chance of live Premier League games ever returning to free-to-air terrestrial TV channels like the BBC and ITV ever again. While the sports channel subscriptions are extortionate enough in themselves, BT and Sky have also been accused of putting up many other charges for all its customers in order to cover the millions of pounds they have paid to the Premier League. Virgin Media claims the current regime causes ‘significant consumer harm’ resulting from escalating rights costs. The inquiry comes after Virgin Media, of which Sir Richard Branson is a shareholder, complained about the way TV rights are sold . Chief executive, Tom Mockridge, welcomed the Ofcom inquiry, saying: ‘The Premier League is a global success story and one of the UK’s greatest exports and everyone wants that to remain the case. ‘The fact remains that fans in the UK pay the highest prices in Europe to watch the least amount of football on TV. Now is the right time to look again at the way live rights are sold to make football even more accessible. ‘We look forward to working constructively with the Premier League, the wider industry and Ofcom to ensure a better deal for football fans.’ Ofcom said: ‘Virgin Media argues that the proportion of matches made available for live television broadcast under the current Premier League rights deals – at 41per cent – is lower than some other leading European leagues, where more matches are available for live television broadcast. ‘The complaint alleges that this contributes to higher prices for consumers of pay TV packages that include premium sport channels and for the pay TV retailers of premium sports channels.’ It said: ‘Ofcom may conduct an investigation where there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that there is an agreement which has as its object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the UK and/or the EU. ‘Ofcom will consider whether there is a breach of the UK and/or EU competition law prohibition on agreements and decisions which restrict or distort competition.’ The regulator said it will discuss any change n the rules that leads to a change to Saturday afternoon football. It said: ‘Ofcom understands that the scheduling of football games is important to many football fans, in particular attending 3pm kick-offs on Saturdays. The investigation will take this into account and Ofcom plans to approach the Football Supporters’ Federation and certain other supporters’ groups to understand their views.’ The Premier League said: ‘The Premier League currently sells its audio-visual rights in a way that is compatible with UK and EU competition law and will continue to do so. ‘We will be able to demonstrate that as part of this process.’","Move could cut monthly subscriptions and lead to rise in games shown live .

"Britain's top military officer confirmed yesterday that David Cameron does not want to cut further the number of troops in Britain's 82,000-strong armed forces. Chief of the Defence Staff General Sir Nicholas Houghton said: 'I know the Prime Minister does not want again to cut the physical manpower of the armed forces. But there is of course still further fiscal consolidation to face.' The Prime Minister has said repeatedly that he does not wants further reductions to the size of the Armed Forces, and suggested the UK should spend at least two per cent of its national income on defence. General Sir Nicholas Houghton (pictured left) confirmed yesterday that Prime Minister David Cameron (right) does not want to cut further the number of troops in Britain's 82,000-strong armed force . However, areas of the Ministry of Defence budget are likely to come under pressure in a new round of spending cuts after the general election, whoever is in power. Sir Nicholas also told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme there had been some 'early glitches' in the attempt to recruit 30,000 Army reservists to plug the gap left by cuts to regular troops. The government wants to expand the Army Reserve to 30,000 by 2018, to offset cuts of 20,000 in full-time manpower. The Prime Minister has said repeatedly that he does not wants further reductions to the size of the Armed Forces, and has suggested the UK should spend at least two per cent of its national income on defence . Sir Nicholas said: '30,000 by 2018 was always going to be quite a tall order, and there have been some early glitches in that campaign to recruit those.' But he added: 'There's much to be confident about - our numbers are growing.' He also insisted the 'streets of the United Kingdom are safer' because of the war in Afghanistan. 'In the last 13/14 years there has not been a single international terrorist attack launched from Afghanistan,' he said. Britain's 13-year war in Afghanistan - which claimed the lives of 453 service men and woman - ended last month.","Sir Nicholas Houghton confirmed Prime Minister doesn't want further cuts .

It . insists it does not need royal permission for its latest product, out in . time for Christmas. ‘This isn’t specifically “Royal Baby George” doll, rather an addition to the Baby Annabell Brother range, named George. This . is a reflection of George no doubt becoming a popular boy’s name,’ a .

The doll is . not tipped to top the Christmas toy sales charts, though. Favourite to . be the best seller, according to the Toy Retailers Association’s Top . Ten, is another doll, the Flying Fairy by Flutterbye, which can take off . and fly thanks to its rotating petal-like wings. The annual Dream Toys listing, unveiled today by the Toy Retailers’ Association highlights the Top 50 toys expected to dominate the Christmas market. Scroll down for video . Top contenders: Among the most sought after children's toys this Christmas is a robotic dog, a tablet computer aimed at helping ten-year-olds do their homework . Other familiar names include the Lego . City Coast Guard set, a Rapidstrike Nerf gun, and an updated version of . the Monopoly board game. Among . the traditional toys on the list are also two tablet computers, the . LeapPad Ultra and the InnoTab 3S, a spinning flying fairy, and a . glittering doctor’s bag for budding medics. Furby enthusiast Emily Squires, 10, who was among children testing out the toys at a Christmas themed exhibition in Marylebone, central London, said she especially liked the new version of the popular because it can now be controlled an app on an Ipad. She said: 'I love it. When you tickle it is laughs and it is so soft to stroke. 'If you use it with the app you can feed it and shower it, and it can even have a baby - a Furbling. 'I definitely want one for Christmas and I am sure that all my friends will want one too. The colours are really cool as well, and it is small enough to take with you wherever you go.” Also creating a stir was the Teksta Robotic Puppy, which, like a real-life puppy responds to voice commands and hand gestures, can bark, cry and use its eyes to share feelings, unlike most family pets it also comes both blue and pink. The top ten toys this Christmas were unveiled today at the Dream Toys listing . Re-inventing a classic: The new furbies can be controlled by a bespoke Ipad app that allows you to feed it, shower it and even have a baby . Blast from the past: The Nerf N-Strike Elite gun has also made it onto the top 50 list, most of which cost less than £25 . Techie toys: The Teksta Robotic Puppy is designed like a real-life puppy and responds to voice commands and hand gestures, can bark, cry and use its eyes to show its emotions . Shakira Riddell-Morales, 11, who spent the event playing with the dog, said: 'I really like that it can make it do a back flip and you can stroke him and feed him - it is a bit like a normal dog. I really want one for Christmas.' Also expected to sell well in the category of technological products, is the LeapPad Ultra, a kids’ learning tablet aimed at four to nine-year-olds which is endorsed by children’s TV presenters Dick and Dom and designed specifically to help under-10s with their schoolwork. Father-of-two, Dom Wood, said: 'It is fantastic and so child friendly and it really encourages them to use their imagination and be creative. They are learning without even realising it. 'It is also very safe and you can control what the kids are seeing and doing. It is such a minefield and this is 100 per cent safe. 'The screen is a good size, and unlike other tablets you can throw it around and it won’t smash. It’s so great that the kids feel like they are using something that is no different to what the adults are using, but are using something that is very child-friendly and educational.'

The doll which comes with a royal bib, is dressed in a regal-themed outfit and is housed in a specially designed box, for £47.99. And it's good news for cash-strapped parents as the price of the average 'must have' Christmas toy will be £10 cheaper this year than in 2012 according to figures released at the show. And although some of the items on this year's Dream Toys list will set some parents back a small fortune, the LeapPad Ultra alone retails at £119.99, the total cost of the ten best selling toys has fallen from £556.90 to £452.90 since last Christmas. Fascinating: Emily Squires, 10 watches the Robo Fishbowl by Zuru-Geemac in action at today's show . Most expensive on the list: The LeapPad Ultra is a pricey gift at £119.99 but it is a tablet computer designed specifically to be safe and education for young children . This means the average top ten selling toy will cost £45.29 this year compared to £55.69 12 months ago. And this year 32 of the top 50 toys are also priced under £25 - making this festive season more affordable than last year. Experts are predicting much cheaper toys . will become the most popular gifts from Santa - including the £12.99 . Hexbug Aquabot, a robotic fish that swims in water. Gary Grant, chairman of the Dream Toys committee, said: 'Christmas 2013 is set to be a strong year for toys and this is a great Dream Toys list that reflects not only the need for toys to appeal to all budgets and tastes, but also how tech is continuing to increase its influence within toys, from pads and robotic dogs to flying fairies and fish. 'There’s a real diversity in the list this . year, which has a good spread of toys over different price points which . I think shows how well the industry is reacting to the current economic . market.' On average, each UK child receives 44 . toys a year, valued at a total of £312, making the toy market in Britain . valued at in excess of £3bn. The Christmas period accounts for around £1bn of those sales, making the festive period the most important time for toysellers. Parents at the fair yesterday welcomed the news that Christmas toys are cheaper this year. Single mum-of-two Jenny Smith, from Rotherham, said: 'It’s great that there are so many cheap toys for my kids this year. 'I . want to give them the best Christmas possible, but I’ve only just paid . off last year, so I really don’t want to end up in debt again.' Children’s tablet gadgets are set to become an £80 million market by the end of the year, having topped a new retailers’ list of predicted Christmas top sellers. Real-life twist: Instead of buying property the new of the classic board game lets players purchase brands such as McDonalds an Nestle . Flying high: The Flutterbye Fairy spins into the air above the head of one the toy testers at today's event . Almost a million of the tablets will be . sold in the UK by the end of the year, according to toy industry analyst . Frederique Tutt of NPD Group. The popularity of the tablet has aided a 6% increase this year in sales of toys with a price tag of £50 or more, according to NPD, a trend it expects to continue through to Christmas. However today's list, selected by a panel representing 80% of toy retailers, suggests traditional favourites are still holding their own, with sales of fashion dolls, classic board games and vehicle playsets all up on last year. Ms Tutt said: 'We anticipate close to one million children’s tablets will be sold in the UK by the end of the year, making this a £80 million plus market. 'In the UK, as in the rest of Europe, people are influenced by a difficult economic climate. Impulse toy buying for instance is experiencing significant declines. 'However in this environment of cautious consumerism our research shows that items with high price tags sell very well, especially good quality brands and innovative concepts. 'Thanks to strong innovation in the hi-tech sector, as well as solid performances in more traditional segments, we expect the year to end on a positive note for the toy market.'","The annual Dream Toys listing, unveiled .

"An Oxford graduate has been jailed for three years in Italy for killing his friend in a 120mph crash while drink-driving. Ryon James Heyn, 26, had sped off from a petrol station without paying shortly before smashing his mother's Mercedes into a truck, killing passenger Stefano Annoni, 35. Pictures of the crash show the car was so badly crumpled, it was barely recognisable. Behind bars: Oxford University graduate Ryon James Heyn has been jailed for three years in Italy for killing his friend in a 120mph crash while drink-driving . Mangled wreck: Heyn, 26, had sped off from a petrol station without paying shortly before smashing his mother's Mercedes (above) into a truck, killing his friend Stefano Annoni . Heyn was jailed for three years and four months for causing the death of his friend after driving over 120mph while under the influence of alcohol and without a proper driving licence. He had been travelling back from Italy to Austria, where he worked, when he stopped at a petrol station near Venice on August 11 this year. But instead of paying for petrol, the pair jumped into the car and sped off. The Mercedes A-class was owned by Heyn's mother and had been taken without permission from his stepfather earlier in the day, the court heard. Heyn was jailed for three years and four months for causing the death of his friend after driving over 120mph while under the influence of alcohol and without a proper driving licence . They had crashed a short while after leaving the petrol station when the car hit a truck. Police were already on the way to arrest the pair after the petrol station manager had raised the alarm. Heyn, who moved to Europe this year and had a home in Lecco, a city in northern Italy, worked for an Austrian company. He was also ordered to pay a fine of 1,400 Euro (£1,108) for drink-driving and refusing a breath test. He was not charged over the theft of petrol after paying compensation to the garage.","Ryon James Heyn crashed his mother's Mercedes into truck near Venice .

"Survivor: Ruby Graupera-Cassimiro, 40, lived through a usually-fatal birth complication when her daughter was delivered by cesarean . A new mother whose heart stopped beating after a rare complication while giving birth miraculously survived 45 minutes with no pulse. Ruby Graupera-Cassimiro, 40, was saved by 'divine providence' after her cesarean section went badly wrong. Amniotic fluid from her womb got into her bloodstream and had stopped her heart beating - which is usually fatal. Doctors at the Boca Raton Regional Hospital in Florida, were just about to pronounce Graupera-Cassimiro dead when her heart restarted for no obvious reason. The complication came just after she gave birth to a healthy daughter, Taily, who is now two and a half weeks old. Grauper-Cassimiro passed out for three hours while medics battle to bring her back. They assumed they had failed, and called her family into the operation room to declare her death officially. Her family had already been told there was nothing more that could be done. But the mother of two, who works in human resources, defied expectations in the September 23 ordeal, and, even more stunningly, suffered no brain damage other other ill-effects. She is now at home and caring for her child. This week she returned to the hospital to thank the medics who helped save her. At the reunion, she said: 'I don't know why I was given this opportunity - but I'm very grateful for it. 'God had the right people in the right place', she told the Sun Sentinel. 'Picture of health': Graupera-Cassimiro is shown above with her daughter Taily at the Boca Raton Regional Hospital . Grauper-Cassimiro was awake and talking to her family after her 'unremarkable' cesarean when she suddenly passed out. Medical workers used shock paddles and chest compressions throughout the emergency to try to restore heart beat and circulation while she was unconscious. Despite a three-hour fight to save her, when Grauper-Cassimiro's pulse gave out, doctors thought she would surely die, and had told her distraught family as much when she pulled through. A hospital spokesman said: 'She essentially spontaneously resuscitated when we were about to call the time of death.' 'Today she is the picture of health.' Doctors had no immediate explanation for her survival. The spokesman called her survival 'divine providence.'

"Dozens of babies have died after contracting meningitis while the Government has been haggling over the cost of a vaccine to prevent the disease. British scientists recommended in March that the vaccine should be given routinely to all infants to protect them against meningitis B, which affects more than 600 people a year, but mostly those under the age of five. But eight months on, despite the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recommending Bexsero, the Department of Health has not been able to agree a price with makers Novartis – with negotiations only beginning in August. Harmonie-Rose Allen from Bath, who turns one this week (pictured left and right) contracted meningitis B and had to have both her legs and arms amputated . Last week David Cameron said he wanted to find a ‘cost-effective way’ of making the UK the first country in the world with a national meningococcal B vaccine. But top doctors said the ‘unacceptable’ delay is costing lives – and that the death toll will accelerate over the winter. According to the charity Meningitis Now, around 20 babies have died of meningitis B since March. The bacterial infection can cause septicaemia, which can be deadly and lead to limb loss. It can also cause brain damage. Young children are most susceptible because their immune systems are not fully developed, although anyone can die from it. Around 400 people have been infected since the spring. Dr Nelly Ninis, a paediatrician and clinical adviser to the Meningitis Research Foundation, feared Ministers were letting the ‘historic’ opportunity to all but eradicate the last major type of bacterial meningitis from Britain pass. She said: ‘We have come to this historic moment, where we have a vaccine to protect against meningitis B, which now accounts for the lion’s share of cases. But now we are fudging it.’ Harmonie-Rose's family - including her parents Freya Hall and Ross Allen, pictured - said it was heartbreaking to know the young girl's suffering could have been spared through the licensed vaccine . Among the most recent victims of the disease is Harmonie-Rose Allen from Bath, who turns one this week. In September her parents Freya Hall, 20, and Ross Allen, 22, celebrated her first steps. But weeks later they were left devastated after being told by doctors at the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children that she had contracted meningitis. It caused such extensive septicaemia that she had to have both her arms and legs amputated. Harmonie-Rose’s aunt Hannah Hall, 31, said it was heartbreaking that a licensed vaccine existed which could have spared her such suffering. Harmonie-Rose's case was mentioned in the House of Lords this week in a plea to David Cameron . She said: ‘The family feel like Harmonie-Rose’s whole life has been robbed. Had this vaccine been made publicly available there is a strong likelihood she would not be in this position.’ Conservative MP for The Cotswolds, Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, brought up Harmonie-Rose’s case as he made his plea to Mr Cameron in the House of Commons during Prime Minister’s Questions on Wednesday. ‘Thirty babies die of this [disease] a year. Much more worryingly, 300 babies are severely maimed,’ Mr Clifton-Brown said. ‘There is a licensed and safe vaccine available. The issue is cost.’ Mr Cameron replied: ‘I’m certainly keen to help if I can. But as [Mr Clifton-Brown] says, there are issues, which is why... we’re having discussions with the producer of this vaccine to see if we can find a cost-effective way of doing this.’ Bexsero was licensed in the UK 22 months ago. Studies show it is 95 per cent effective, after the recommended three doses. At its NHS ‘list price’ of £75 a jab, it would cost £225 to give each child three doses, meaning the programme would cost £150 million annually. The JCVI said it should only be introduced if a cost-effective price is achieved. However, it is understood Novartis has been willing to offer a substantial discount. No one from Novartis was willing to comment last night. However a Department of Health spokesman said that the ‘proper procurement rules’ had to be followed, and officials had been working through the process ‘as quickly as we can’. He added: ‘We are continuing our negotiations to agree a cost-effective price.’","Scientists said infants should have vaccine to protect against meningitis B .

"More than a million people are taking part in an informal vote on whether Catalonia should split from the rest of Spain. The Spanish judiciary has ruled the vote unconstitutional but the regional Catalan government has gone ahead with the vote. Spain's constitutional court suspended earlier plans for a referendum on independence. Pro-independence demonstrators of Catalonia raise their regional flags to support an informal vote . Tensions were high as anti-independence protesters burnt pro-independence flags - 'estelada' (pictured) More than one million people queued up to cast their vote in the informal poll in north-eastern Spain . The Catalan government said that more than 1.1 million of the 5.4 million eligible voters had voted by 1pm local time at polling stations manned with more than 40,000 volunteers. Among the voters was Bayern Munich's Catalan coach Pep Guardiola. Voters will be asked whether they want a Catalan state and whether that state should be independent. 'Despite the enormous impediments, we have been able to get out the ballot boxes and vote,' regional president Artur Mas said after depositing his ballot at a school in Barcelona. Mr Mas warned the Spanish government against any attempt to halt the vote. He said: 'I don't know what they will do, it does not depend on us, but if they have a minimum of common sense I think any action out of the ordinary would be a direct attack on democracy and a direct attack on fundamental rights.' He went on to say the vote, which lacks guarantees such as an electoral roll, is only symbolic. However it is hoped a strong vote of support will put more pressure on the central government to open negotiations over more tax and political autonomy, ultimately leading to a full-blown independence referendum. Demonstrators hold a Spanish flag as they protest on Madrid's Plaza de Catalunia for unity of the Spanish state . People excitedly queue with the pro-independence Catalan flag to cast their vote at an informal polling station . Catalan President Artur Mas holds up his ballot while voting in a symbolic independence vote in Barcelona . Voters in Barcelona wait in the rain to vote in the non-binding poll on the independence of Catalonia from Spain . Polls show that the majority of Catalonia's 7.5 million inhabitants want an official vote on independence while around half support breaking centuries-old ties with Spain. There was a festive atmosphere as hundreds lined up in front of another school in Barcelona, with some wearing pro-independence regalia. 'I voted for independence because I've always felt very Catalan,' said Nuria Silvestre, a 44-year-old teacher. 'Maybe I wasn't so radical before, but the fact that they are prohibiting (the vote) from Madrid has made me.' Catalan TV showed similar lines of voters across the region. A man poses with his ballot at a polling station on whether Catalonia should break away from the rest of Spain . Spanish unionists hold Spanish flags and banners during a protest against independence in Madrid . In response to the informal vote, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy urged the region to return to 'sanity' and for talks 'within the legal framework of the constitution'. He said the vote would be 'neither a referendum nor a consultation nor anything of the sort'. He added: 'What is certain is that it will not have any effect.' Spanish state prosecutors have announced they will open an investigation to determine if by holding the informal vote in defiance of the court's suspension the Catalan government has broken the law. Catalonia has seen rallies of hundreds of thousands of pro-independence supporters for the past three years. It is a wealthy region of 7.5 million people and contributes more to the Spanish economy than it gets back through central government funds. Economic and cultural grievances have fuelled Catalan nationalism. Catalonia's push for independence comes two months after Scots voted to remain in the United Kingdom. Mr Mas said after the defeat of the 'Yes' campaign: 'This is a powerful and strong message that the UK is sending to the entire world - that if there is such a conflict elsewhere in the world, you have the right way to try to resolve these differences,' 'So it is not a setback, it is a very positive message for us and should be for the central institutions in Madrid.'","People of Catalonia are voting in a non-binding poll on independence .

"Alaskans are demanding that Snoop Dogg keep his promise to perform in the state - known as the ‘last frontier’ - after voters choose to legalize pot last Tuesday. The rapper and marijuana enthusiast made a promise back in September that he would perform a concert in Alaska if the state voted to legalize the recreational use of marijuana in the midterm elections. ‘If we get y'all to vote yes on Proposition 2, Snoop Dogg is coming to Alaska to do a concert, a wellness retreat concert, and I'm bringing some of that California with me to celebrate,’ said the hip hop star during an episode of his Double G News webcast. Snoop Dogg had promised that he would perform a concert in Alaska if the state voted to legalize the recreational use of marijuana in the mid-term elections . The rapper re-tweeted a Washington Post story about Alaskans demanding that he perform a concert in the state following Tuesday's vote to legalize marijuana . On Tuesday, Alaskans voted to legalize marijuana and tax and regulate it just like alcohol and many celebrated by playing Snoop hits like Gin And Juice and Drop It Like It’s Hot. Many also took to Twitter to remind the rapper about his promise. 'Will you be playing a show in #Fairbanks on your upcoming Alaska tour?' tweeted Weston Morrow. 'Sooooooo... bout that @SnoopDogg concert in Alaska?' asked MSL. User D-ice tweeted: 'Sounds like its concert time for @SnoopDogg in Alaska'. On Wednesday morning the hip hop star even re-tweeted a Washington Post story about his promise, although he has yet to make any comment on if and when a show might take place. He has a little time however as the new law will not take effect until 90 days after the election. The initiative allows adults 21 years of age and older to possess up to one ounce of marijuana and grow limited amounts in private.

Alaskans voted to legalize marijuana and tax and regulate it just like alcohol and many celebrated on Tuesday night by playing Snoop hits like Gin And Juice and Drop It Like It’s Hot . Marijuana will also be cultivated, tested, and sold by licensed, taxpaying businesses that require proof of age - instead of criminal enterprises in the underground market. Alaska voters approved a ballot measure to end marijuana prohibition on Tuesday, capping off a historic election year for marijuana policy reform. Voters in Oregon also adopted a similar measure, making it the third state in the nation to end marijuana prohibition, following Colorado and Washington. Measure 91 in Oregon and Ballot Measure 2 in Alaska make possession of marijuana legal for adults 21 years of age and older, and they establish systems in which marijuana is regulated and taxed similarly to alcohol.

"Almost 3,500 women have entered the jobs market every week in a ‘quiet revolution’ since the Coalition came to power, figures reveal today. Three quarters of a million additional women have found work since 2010 – pushing the total to a record 14.4 million. Ministers said women have succeeded in finding jobs in male-dominated industries such as construction and science. About 80 per cent of new posts were in managerial, professional and technical jobs. Three quarters of a million additional women have found work since 2010, pushing the total to a record 14.4 million (file image) But critics said they fear the increase shows many mothers are being forced back to work, as single-income families facing poor wage growth struggle to make ends meet. While the number of women in full-time work rose by 230,000 this year, part-time work also rose by 140,000, the Office for National Statistics data showed, which is thought to be driven by women with young families looking for flexible hours or those in their 50s and 60s returning after a career break. Last night, one pressure group accused the Government of undervaluing full-time parents and focusing on getting as many women back to work as they can, even where it means taking low-paid work that scarcely covers childcare costs. Lynne Burnham, from Mothers At Home Matter, said: ‘I think if we look behind these figures we will find a lot of women working part-time hours in their evenings or in menial jobs. A lot of them may have wanted to stay at home with their children, but they cannot afford to and the Government does not incentivise them to do so. ‘The role of the mother or father who stays at home to look after their children has been so undervalued by this Government. Just because you are not in employment does not mean you are not working. ‘Looking after children or an elderly relative is working, but politicians do not recognise this, they just want more women in work.’ Siobhan Freegard, co-founder of the parenting website Netmums, said: ‘It is not just women entering fulfilling careers in the boardroom or careers in law and science, it is also about mothers being forced to take low-paid jobs in supermarkets to pay their bills.’ But critics say they are concerned the increase shows many mothers are being forced back to work, as single-income families facing poor wage growth struggle to make ends meet (file image) Ministers claim they have taken steps to support stay-at-home mothers in recent years, and last week, Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith announced the Government would strengthen its support for families, and in particular marriage, by passing all new policies through a ‘family test’. From April, married couples will be able to transfer £1,000 of any unused income tax personal allowance to their spouse – which will be worth a maximum of £200. But from next September, couples who both work will receive tax-free childcare vouchers of up to £2,000 a year per child. Education Secretary and Minister for Women and Equalities Nicky Morgan said they had made it ‘easier for women to balance work and families’ by giving employees the right to request flexible working and introducing shared parental leave from 2015. Employment Minister Esther McVey said: ‘The women of the UK have been staging a quiet revolution. Women are in work in unprecedented numbers, and recent growth has been overwhelmingly into the top professions.’","Almost 3,500 women entering the jobs market every week .

"The company behind plans for a new high-speed rail link has been accused of using ‘strong arm tactics’ to stop people from raising their objections to the £50 billion HS2 project. Residents who fear their communities will be blighted by the planned 225mph rail line say they were visited at home by groups of HS2 officials and urged not to give evidence to a powerful parliamentary committee which can order major changes to the scheme. The visits came after they submitted petitions to the HS2 Select Committee, which led them to be targeted by HS2 Ltd – the Government-funded company behind the scheme. Scroll down for video . Objection: Gill Stockdale was visited at home by HS2 Ltd staff, who told her: 'We want to buy you off' HS2 Ltd’s strategy has come to light after grandmother Gill Stockdale, 66, appeared before the committee and revealed how four officials had tried to strike a deal with her in her living room after she raised objections about construction site lorries travelling outside the primary school attended by her granddaughter. She said David McCann, an HS2 Ltd engineer, told her: ‘We want to buy you off to prevent you from appearing before the Select Committee and will continue trying to do so right up to the doors of Committee Room 5 [where the hearings are being held].’ Mrs Stockdale said that rather than money, HS2 Ltd had offered a pedestrian crossing near the primary school in the village of Hill Ridware, Staffordshire, close to where the first phase of the HS2 line will end. She said: ‘They stated their intention clearly – they just wanted to shut me up.’ The cross-party High Speed Rail Bill Committee has received almost 2,000 petitions against HS2 and has started hearing each case in turn. It has the power to order costly alterations to the proposed route, further tunnelling and noise prevention barriers. Thirty-seven objectors have so far appeared before the committee. However, a further 32 people due to give evidence have suddenly withdrawn their opposition or failed to show up on their allotted day. Derek Silverwood, 79, who runs a nature reserve for a society for the disabled in Handsacre, said he was also visited by Mr McCann, petitions manager Miss Benson and two other HS2 Ltd officials. This image issued by HS2 shows the Birmingham and Fazeley viaduct, part of the proposed route for the high speed rail scheme . He said: ‘Having talked all around my petition, Daisy Benson suddenly said, “Are you sure you still want to go ahead?” I told them nothing would stop me as I was going to say my piece no matter what. ‘I got the distinct impression they would have been cock-a-hoop if I suddenly said I wouldn’t be going to London. It feels like they are trying to reduce the number of petitions the committee has to consider.’ HS2 last night denied any wrongdoing in its dealings with objectors. A spokesman said: ‘We do not seek in any way to curtail people’s right to appear before the Commons Committee. HS2 Ltd is seeking to resolve people’s concerns before they go to Parliament.’ Sir Peter Bottomley, a Conservative MP on the HS2 Select Committee, said he was not aware of any intimidation tactics and said the negotiations appeared ‘perfectly normal’. He added: ‘If they can reach a satisfactory agreement which is fair to the public purse and to the petitioner, that’s fine.’","Grandmother Gill Stockdale says she was visited at home by HS2 Ltd staff .

"Theresa May yesterday suggested Britain should leave the European Union unless it embraces major reforms as she sought to crush a rebellion by Tory MPs. The Home Secretary, a leading contender to succeed David Cameron, burnished her Eurosceptic credentials by flirting with the exit of Britain from Europe – the so-called ‘Brexit’. But she told rebel colleagues they were picking the wrong battle by opposing British membership of the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) which allows police to extradite suspects quickly between EU states. Theresa May yesterday suggested Britain should leave the European Union unless it embraces major reforms as she sought to crush a rebellion by Tory MPs . The UK has to decide by December 1 whether to continue to adhere to the EU criminal justice and law enforcement measures. The UK has opted out of all 133, but ministers want to opt back in to 35, including the EAW. MPs will vote today and though the Tory leadership is facing a backbench rebellion, the measure will pass with Labour and Liberal Democrat backing. Mrs May said yesterday she had secured significant changes to the way the warrant operates, allowing Britain to block extradition of UK suspects for minor offences. But she said: ‘If we want to stop foreign criminals from coming to Britain, deal with European fighters coming back from Syria, stop British criminals evading justice abroad, prevent foreign criminals evading justice by hiding here, and get foreign criminals out of our prisons, these measures are vital.’ However, writing in the Sunday Telegraph, she made a wider plea for major reforms to the EU so membership is more in Britain’s interests. Going beyond her law and order brief, she insisted Brussels red tape is holding back the UK economy. The Home Secretary, a leading contender to succeed David Cameron, burnished her Eurosceptic credentials by flirting with the exit of Britain from Europe – the so-called ‘Brexit’ She wrote: ‘While access to the world’s biggest single market is in our national interest, the EU’s rules hold back not just our economy, but also the economies of every other member state. That is why we need to argue for changes. 'I believe the politicians who argue we are better off in the EU, whatever the terms, are wrong. But I also believe the politicians who argue we are better off out, whatever the terms, are also wrong.’ Colleagues saw Mrs May’s intervention as an attempt to reassure Tory backbenches of her Euroscepticism ahead of a potential leadership contest if the party loses the next general election. She is privately said to take an ‘even more hardline’ approach to European human rights law, for example, than Justice Secretary Chris Grayling. Cabinet ministers Philip Hammond and Michael Gove have gone further, saying publicly they would vote to leave the EU on the current terms. Sources said the whips’ office had significantly diminished the number of Tory rebels opposing the EAW. Polls suggest public support for the system, with 56 per cent saying the UK should be in it, and 18 per cent disagreeing. j.chapman@dailymail.co.uk .","Home Secretary, a leading contender to succeed David Cameron, burnished her Eurosceptic credentials by flirting with the exit of Britain from Europe .

"Should Brendan Rodgers require any inspiration for his Liverpool players ahead of a match with Crystal Palace that they must win well to stand a chance of claiming the title, a DVD of the sides’ meeting in September 1989 would be a good idea. Not only did Liverpool win 9-0, they went on to lift the title – their last to date. The same scoreline at Selhurst Park would wipe out Manchester City’s advantage on goal difference and place pressure on their rivals ahead of Aston Villa’s trip to the Etihad on Wednesday. With Tony Pulis’s side well-drilled that remains a remote possibility but memories of that match offer Liverpool, who have five times score five or more in a Premier League game this season, an opportunity to hope. Yet later in the 1989/90 season it was Palace who stopped Liverpool when it really mattered. Alan Pardew rose to head an extra-time winner in the FA Cup semi-final to deny Liverpool an unprecedented double. One-up: Ian Rush put Liverpool ahead against Palace in the 1990 FA Cup semi-final . Response: Bruce Grobbelaar (third from right) watches on as Mark Bright equalises for Palace . Joy: Palace celebrate Bright's goal, as they showed huge resolve against the team that had thrashed them 9-0 . With such omens offering some food for thought, it remains to be seen which Liverpool will turn up tonight; the team that has brushed aside many others this year, or the one which stalled against a resolute Chelsea? In the 1989/90 season Palace were freshly promoted and came unstuck at Anfield as eight different players found the net – the only time this has happened in the top-flight of English football. Steve Nicol opened and closed the scoring, with Steve McMahon, Ian Rush, Gary Gillespie, Peter Beardsley, John Aldridge, John Barnes and Glenn Hysen notching in between. To add to Palace's misery, Geoff Thomas missed a penalty. Palace did stay up, mind. Doubling up: Gary O'Reilly fired Palace into a 2-1 lead from close range at Villa Park . Final flourish: Alan Pardew (number 11) headed home a 109th-minute winner to send Palace to Wembley . Mobbed: Pardew's winner sent the Palace fans, and his team-mates, into delerium . Then and now: Pardew celebrates his winner in 1990 (left) but is under pressure as Newcatle manager now . But seven months later Palace had their revenge. Despite entering the match as huge underdogs and twice going behind, Steve Coppell’s team triumphed. Rush opened the scoring early before Mark Bright and Gary O’Reilly put Palace ahead. McMahon equalised and when Barnes converted a penalty in the 83rd minute in seemed Liverpool were set for Wembley.

"Romelu Lukaku has apologised for any offence caused by his comments regarding Nicolas Anelka earlier this week. Lukaku, the 20-year-old Belgium striker who is on loan at Everton from Chelsea, featured in a video interview posted on the Toffees' website in which he said there did not have to be 'such a big deal' made about Anelka's controversial 'quenelle' celebration and that he thought the West Brom frontman should not be banned over it.

"When it comes to World Cup pedigree, four- time winners Italy must make Roy Hodgson’s England green with envy. But there were plenty of questions to ponder for coach Cesare Prandelli as Italy’s World Cup boot camp got under way at their fabulous training complex in Coverciano, just outside Florence. Prandelli’s men are unique among the 32 nations heading for Brazil in not having a single player among their provisional squad who is based in England. VIDEO Scroll down for Balotelli and Pirlo lead Italy training ahead of the World Cup . Casting an eye: Cesare Prandelli watches on as his Italy team began their bootcamp in Florence . Star men: Mario Balotelli and Andrea Pirlo go through their paces at the training session . Hodgson has named his World Cup 23 and . probably knows his XI for England’s first game in Brazil against Italy . on June 14 in Manaus. No such luck for Prandelli, who has the . job of improving on Italy’s last tournament when they reached the final . of Euro 2012. There were 31 . players doing laps of the track and fitness tests in 80 degree heat on Tuesday. As he addressed the media for the first time, the manager . didn’t seem to have much idea who was going to make the cut from his . provisional squad named last week. The . problems are particularly acute up front where all the  contenders have . different issues. Antonio Cassano is unpredictable, ex-Manchester . United striker Giuseppe Rossi is coming off a long-term injury, Serie . A’s leading scorer Ciro Immobile is raw and Mario Balotelli is like . Cassano, but even more so. ‘I . will take my time to name my 23 right up until the deadline of June 2 . if I have to,’ said Prandelli. ‘This is what the camp is for, to assess . fitness and strength. Strength is important.’ And woe betide any mavericks — Balotelli and Cassano come to mind — who step out of line. ‘When . a player puts his ego ahead of everybody, then it becomes a problem. And it’s the same for me,’ said Prandelli. ‘We are working with the aim . of reaching the final.

Italy . outplayed England in the Euro 2012 quarter-final even though they only . advanced on penalties, but Prandelli expects a tougher task this time. ‘England . are younger, they are quicker and they have pace on the wings,’ he . noted. ‘And the English mentality is always good. In Manaus, when . conditions might be difficult, they won’t give in. ‘The . first game is normally key. If you get three points immediately, you . are up and running. Spain lost the first game at 2010 so there  are . exceptions, but we can’t think that way.’ Hard work: Balotelli sweats in the heat during the training session on Tuesday . Couldn't be better: Gianluigi Buffon winks at a nearby camera as Italy began their World Cup preparations . Calm: Italy will be looking to Andrea Pirlo to help them keep possession in the Brazilian heat . Just . as Balotelli dominated attention during his time at Manchester City, so . there were more questions asked about him than anyone else at . Prandelli’s conference. Nobody . is daring to suggest he will be left out the squad — his heroics at . Euro 2012 mean he is regarded as a wild card worth having. But . Balotelli, who has just had a disappointing season with AC Milan, didn’t . exactly bust a gut in training alongside the veteran Andrea Pirlo, . sauntering out an hour behind some of his colleagues clutching a bottle . of water. Prandelli said afterwards: ‘It was like the first day of school, a lot of emotion.’ He . promises to have the squad doing hard, double sessions before they . travel to play the Irish. Italy have no English-based player in the . squad but four — Balotelli (Manchester City), Rossi (Manchester United), . Gabriel Paletta and Alberto Aquilani (both  Liverpool) — have . previously been at big North West clubs. Tough: Antonio Cassano feels the burn during a sprint with coaches watching on . Determined to get there: Prandelli is not writing off Giuseppe Rossi, despite his lack of match fitness . Rossi, 27, has only played four times since recovering from a serious knee injury that kept him out for four months. Prandelli . is not writing him off, however, saying: ‘Rossi is very talented and . has shown the  spirit of a champion to come back in time.’ Italy have already had to change their media plans for today. Goalkeper . Gigi Buffon, one of four survivors from the Italy squad who won the . World Cup in 2006, would normally have spoken as team captain but he . will probably swerve it this time after announcing that he is . separating from his Czech wife Alena.

"One of the eight people whose crack-related prison sentences based on mandatory minimums has been revealed to be the cousin of the Democratic governor of Massachusetts. Governor Deval Patrick is a close ally of President Obama's but he said that he was not involved in the commutation application for Reynolds Allen Wintersmith Jr., his 39-year-old cousin who was sentenced to life in prison for possession and intent to distribute. 'There’s a significant age gap between the two, and the governor has no recollection of having met Mr. Wintersmith,' spokeswoman Jesse Mermell said of the 59-year-old governor. Related: One of the eight prisoners whose drug charges were commuted was Reynolds Allen Wintersmith Jr (left) who is the first cousin of Obama supporter Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick (right) Connected: Deval Patrick has been a supporter of President Obama for years (seen together in 2009) and the Massachusetts governor was an Obama surrogate on both campaigns . 'Governor Patrick had no involvement in any application for a commutation of Mr Wintersmith,' she told The Boston Globe. Mr Patrick is close with the President and was one of the top contenders to be Mr Obama's attorney general but Eric Holder was chosen instead. The two have spent time together on and off the campaign trail, as Mr Patrick was a surrogate for the President's re-election campaign and dined with the Obamas during their summer vacation in Martha's Vineyard this year. The outgoing governor's spokeswoman said that while Mr Patrick was aware that his cousin was in a Rockford, Illinois prison, she said that he did not know the details of the case. Wintersmith was originally sentenced in 1994 to life imprisonment with five years' supervised release and a $1,000 fine because of his conviction for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute both cocaine and crack. He will now be released on April 17, 2014. In a statement published online following the commutation announcement, the president said that the eight men and women had been sent to jail because of an 'unfair system' and all had served at least 15 years in prison, many under mandatory minimums that required judges to impose long sentences even if they didn't think the time fit the crime. 'If they had been sentenced under the current law, many of them would have already served their time and paid their debt to society,' Obama said. 'Instead, because of a disparity in the . law that is now recognized as unjust, they remain in prison, separated . from their families and their communities, at a cost of millions of . taxpayer dollars each year.' Commuted sentences: President Barack Obama speaks to the media on Wednesday - on Thursday he announced that he was commuting the sentences of eight men and women convicted of crack cocaine offenses . The commutation is seen as an attempt . to redress the glaring racial disparity between those serving sentences . for crack possession and those jailed for carrying cocaine. Crack . cocaine offenses were treated more harshly under old laws than those . involving the powder form of the drug and led to tens of thousands of . black people serving long prison terms, while those caught with cocaine - . who were more likely to be white - were handed lenient jail time. Of . the eight, some had been sentenced to life imprisonment for dealing . crack cocaine at the age of only 17 because of harsher sentences created . in the 1980s designed to fight what was seen as an epidemic of the . highly addictive drug on the streets of America. Ezell Gilbert: This Tampa, Florida native was charged with possession with intent to deliver cocaine base and possession with intent to distribute marijuana and sentenced in 1997 to spend more than 24 years behind bars . In the previous five years of his presidency, Obama had only commuted one drug sentence and pardoned 39 people. The men and women will be released in the next 120 days and the lucky eight include several high profile inmates who have been at the forefront of campaigns to have their tough drug-conviction quashed. Many of the eight, such as Clarence . Aaron of Mobile, Alabama, who was 22 when he was sentenced to three life . terms for a 1993 drug deal were young. Civil . rights groups have been fighting vociferously for Aaron and last year . thr Justice Department's inspector general critcized the department's . pardon office for mishandling his petition for clemency. Margaret . Love, a former pardon lawyer who used to work at the Justice Department . who represents Aaron said that her client is 'very grateful' to the . president. 'He was absolutely overcome,' said Love to the New York Times. 'Actually, . I was, too. He was in tears. This has been a long haul for him, 20 . years. He just was speechless, and it’s very exciting.' Another recipient of a commuted sentence from the president is Reynolds Wintersmith, of Rockford, Illinois. He was sentenced to life in prison in 1994 for dealing crack at the age of 17 as was Stephanie George of Pensacola, Florida, who got a life in prison for hiding her boyfriend's stash of crack cocaine in 1997, aged just 27. In both of these cases the judge who handed out the mandatory sentences called them unjust and said their hands were tied. A pardon forgives a crime and wipes out the conviction, typically after the sentence has been served. A commutation leaves the conviction but ends the punishment. Helen Gray (left) and Stephanie Yvette George (right) The White House said each of the eight people whose sentences were commuted was sentenced prior to the Fair Sentencing Act and that they would have received lesser sentences if convicted of the same crime today . Groups that advocate for prisoners . have criticized Obama for being stingy with his power - George W. Bush . granted 189 petitions for pardon and 11 for clemency, while Bill Clinton . granted 396 for pardon and 61 for clemency. The . old sentencing guidelines subjected tens of thousands of blacks to long . prison terms for crack cocaine convictions while giving far more . lenient sentences to those caught with powder who were more likely to be . white. It was enacted in 1986 when crack cocaine use was rampant and considered a particularly violent drug. Under . that law, a person convicted of possessing five grams of crack cocaine . got the same mandatory prison term as someone with 500 grams - 100 times . - of powder cocaine. The Fair Sentencing Act reduced the ratio to about 18-1 and eliminated a five-year mandatory minimum for first-time possession of crack. This also comes at a time when draconian sentences are going out of fashion as the nation deals with having only five-percent of the world's population, but 25-percent of its prison inmates. According to a release issued by the White House, the commutations were granted to: . Ethan Nadelmann, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, called on Obama do to more. 'Kudos to President Obama for commuting these eight people, but shame on the president for not commuting many more. 'With over 100,000 people still in federal prison on nonviolent drug charges, clearly thousands more are deserving of the same freedom,' he said. White House officials say he doesn't believe that clemency can be a solution on a large scale, because it's such a time intensive process and there are thousands of federal inmates affected. The Obama administration wants to make the Fair Sentencing Act retroactive, and the president called on Congress to act in the new year. 'Commuting the sentences of these eight Americans is an important step toward restoring fundamental ideals of justice and fairness,' Obama said. 'But it must not be the last. In the new year, lawmakers should act on the kinds of bipartisan sentencing reform measures already working their way through Congress. 'Together, we must ensure that our taxpayer dollars are spent wisely, and that our justice system keeps its basic promise of equal treatment for all.' Clarence-Aaron: Obama said in a statement that the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act has begun to right to a decades-old injustice, but for thousands of inmates, it came too late . White House officials say Obama had only approved a single clemency petition among more than 8,000 received because it's the only one that had been given a positive recommendation by the Justice Department. According to one senior Obama aide, the president expressed frustration that he wasn't receiving more positive recommendations. So White House counselor Kathryn Ruemmler approached Justice's Office of the Pardon Attorney early this year and asked them to take a hard look at the clemency petitions filed by convicts for any that might have merit, given the change in the drug sentencing law. The Office of the Pardon Attorney responded this fall by presenting the White House with 21 recommendations for pardons and clemency. Ruemmler oversaw an independent analysis and turned over detailed memos on the cases to the president, who signed off on them all, according to White House officials. In August, Attorney General Eric Holder announced a major shift in federal sentencing policies, targeting long mandatory terms that he said have flooded the nation's prisons with low-level drug offenders and diverted crime-fighting dollars that could be far better spent. As a first step, Holder has instructed federal prosecutors to stop charging many nonviolent drug defendants with offenses that carry mandatory minimum sentences. His next step will be working with a bipartisan group in Congress to give judges greater discretion in sentencing.","President Obama commuted the prison sentences of eight people on Thursday saying their crack cocaine offenses did not justify life sentences .

"He was in the throes of a political scandal that would ultimately see him forced to leave the White House. And this recording of a phone call between Richard Nixon and his Chief of Staff H.R Haldeman in April 1973 suggests the embattled president may have indulged in a few drinks to take his mind off the Watergate trial. In it the president - who hours before had announced that Haldeman would be resigning over Watergate - can be heard telling his long-serving aide: 'You're a strong man, Goddamnit, and I love you.' Scroll down for audio and video . 'I love you, as you know... like my brother': Former U.S. President Richard Nixon, left, sounds emotional during the phone conversation with H.R. Haldeman, right, whose resignation he had demanded after Watergate . After vowing to never 'discuss the son-of-bitching Watergate thing again', 'never, never, never, never', Nixon goes on to declare again: 'I love you, as you know... like my brother.' He goes on to ask whether Haldeman could make some calls to gauge the reaction to his speech that day, 'like the old style'. Haldeman tells his now ex-boss: 'I don't think I can... I'm in an odd spot to try and do that.' Nixon quickly adds: 'I completely agree... Don't call a Goddamn soul.' Saying goodbye, the president tells Haldeman, who he had known for almost 20 years: 'Alright boy, keep the faith.' Scandal: The former White House Chief of Staff ultimately served 18 months in prison over Watergate . AUDIO: Listen to call between Richard Nixon and White House Chief of Staff in April 1973 . Long-time adviser: Richard Nixon, then Vice President, is seen with Haldeman in March 1960 . Featured in the CNN documentary 'Our Nixon', the audio clip of the former U.S. president's bizarre ramblings have led to speculation that he was drunk at the time of the phone call, which took place at 10.16pm on April 30. 'Keep the faith': Richard Nixon announced his own resignation on August 8 1974 . That day Nixon had delivered a speech announcing the resignations of his closest advisers, Haldeman and John Ehrlichman, the assistant to the President for Domestic Affairs, in the wake of the Watergate scandal. He also used the televised speech to confirm that White House counsel John Dean and Attorney General Richard Kleindienst would also be resigning. During their conversation Nixon appears to bemoan the fact that no other cabinet officers aside from Haldeman had called him after his speech. Haldeman tries to reassure Nixon that staff had tried to prevent his own call from being put through to the President. 'When I called, the board said they had been instructed not to put any calls through,' Haldeman says. Nixon, apparently unconvinced, replies: 'The hell with that, I told them to put all the calls through.' Haldeman eventually served 18 months in prison after being convicted of conspiracy and obstruction of justice in January 1975. The Watergate scandal was triggered by a break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington on June 17, 1972, when five men were arrested for trying to bug the building. By October of that year, the FBI had linked the break-in to spying and sabotage by the Republican President's re-election campaign. On 8 August 1974, Richard Nixon became the first U.S. President to resign, after handing over 64 tapes of White House discussions. It would be a further 29 years before 'Deep Throat', the secret informant who provided information on the story to Washington Post journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, was identified as former FBI associate director Mark Felt. President Nixon: Hello? H.R Haldeman: Hi. Nixon: Hope I didn't let you down. Haldeman: No, sir. You got your points over, and now you've got it set right and move on. You're right where you ought to be. Nixon: Well, it's a tough thing, Bob, for you and for John and the rest, but, goddamnit, I'm never going to discuss the son-of-bitching Watergate thing again. Never, never, never, never. Don't you agree? Haldeman: Yes, sir. You've done it now, and you've laid out your position. You've laid out--you've taken your steps. You've put the-- . Nixon: Interesting thing, we haven't heard a - the only cabinet member that has called-and this is 50 minutes after the thing is over-- is Cap Weinberger, bless his soul. All the rest are waiting to see what the polls show. Goddamn strong Cabinet, isn't it? Haldeman: You better check and be sure, because they may--you know , we've had a -- . Nixon: No, they know, they know, they know who to call, they know they can get through. But in any event, I just want you to know that Cap called -and he is all the way. Haldeman: Good. Nixon: But let me say you're a strong man, goddamnit, and I love you. Haldeman: Well- . Nixon: And, you know, I love John and all the rest, and, by God, keep the faith. Keep the faith. You're going to win this son of a bitch. Haldeman: Absolutely. Nixon: You noticed what I said about the violence and so forth on the other side? I mean there were some intricacies in this that only the sophisticated will understand. Haldeman: Yes sir. I want to get the text because there were some things to work on from there, that we can build on-- . Nixon: I thought it was good to end on what I deeply felt - the religious note - you know - God bless America. I'm sure it must have driven you up the wall, it didn't drive me up the wall, but I felt that way. Haldeman: No, I'm all for that, I completely agree. Nixon: I don't know whether you can call and get any reactions? And call me back, like the old style? Haldeman: I don't think I can . Nixon: I completely agree . Haldeman: I'm in an odd spot to try and do that- . Nixon: Don't call a goddamn soul. Let me just say, getting this call from you, when I haven't heard from any cabinet officer, except Weinberger, an hour afterwards - and no staff member- . Haldeman: When I called, the board said they were instructed not to put any calls through- . Nixon: The hell with that, I told them to put all the calls through . Haldeman: Well, that may be why you haven't gotten them - because- . Nixon: Alright, I'll change it. Fine, I'll change it.

"Newcastle are reviving interest in signing Wilfried Zaha from Manchester United. The former Crystal Palace winger had hoped to be a part of Louis van Gaal's plans at Old Trafford, but Alan Pardew believes that he may be available this summer. Pardew had expressed an interest in taking Zaha on loan last January, but the young Englishman moved to Cardiff City instead. Wanted: Zaha in action against Newcastle in one of his few appearances for Manchester United . Playing time: The winger was on loan at Cardiff last season but wants to stay at Old Trafford . Zaha endured an immensely disappointing first season at Old Trafford under David Moyes, where the England under-21 international failed to start a single match in the Barclays Premier League before going out on loan. Zaha was Sir Alex Ferguson’s final signing as Manchester United manager, joining the club in a £15million deal and on a five-and-a-half year contract. Benched: Zaha failed to make an impression after being signed by Sir Alex Ferguson last summer . The player himself would rather stay in Manchester, with van Gaal's reputation for developing young talent a major attraction, but is understood to want at least some first team football.","Zaha wants to stay at Old Trafford .

"A student at Brown university has tested positive for a date-rape drug after drinking alcoholic punch at a party where a female student was allegedly victim of a sex assault. Tests confirmed the unnamed student had GHB, a colorless, odorless sedative, in their system after an October 17 party where she drank at an event by the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. The female student, who has claimed she was sexually assaulted after drinking at the same party, also drank the punch. Her tests results have not come back yet. Sex assault: A student at Brown University, pictured, said she was sexually assaulted after a frat party. Tests have now confirmed date-rape drugs were used on another student at the party . Campus officials at the school in Providence, Rhode Island, warned students about the drug in an email update on the case, reported today by the Providence Journal. Margaret Klawunn said the two students felt 'a rapid onset of intoxication'  and 'memory loss for a significant period of time' beyond anything they would expect from the amount of punch they drank. Denial: Members of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, who hosted the event, say the drugging and alleged assault are nothing to do with their members . She went on to warn students about GHB (gamma hydroxybutyrate), describing it as 'a colorless, odorless drug that can be hard to detect in a drink... but has a strong sedative effect that is incapacitating.' The fraternity has been suspended in the wake of the accusations, officially for holding a party with alcohol present without asking permission. Members of Phi Kappa Psi have angrily denied any involvement in the drugging or alleged assault. In a letter published by the college newspaper, members said they were 'confident 'that in no way did any member of Phi Kappa Psi engage in or perpetrate such atrocious and criminal behavior.' They said no members of the fraternity have been accused, or criminally charged with sexual assault. In an earlier announcement, Brown officials wrote: 'The behavior in question, if true, is a violation of the standards of student conduct, Rhode Island criminal law and the values we hold as a community.' Students with information about the date-rape drug or the alleged sexual assault have been urged to contact university police.","Student was at party held by Phi Kappa Psi fraternity on October 17 .

"Manchester . United are reported to have made an offer for Wolfsburg left-back . Ricardo Rodriguez but the club has yet to confirm the interest. With Juventus keen on Patrice Evra, United will need another option as competition for Luke Shaw but Wolfsburg want more than £15million for Rodriguez who has also been watched by Liverpool and Tottenham. He impressed for Switzerland at the World Cup on the back of a decent Bundesliga season. High flyer: Ricardo Rodriguez (right) has impressed at the World Cup for Switzerland . On the move: Ricardo Rodriguez may soon be swapping Wolfsburg for Manchester according to reports . United are interested in several players but are wary of being used to hike up prices. They have yet to make an offer for Arturo Vidal at Juventus, although he has been on their list for some time and that applies for Angel di Maria, too, with Real Madrid keen to sell for inflated prices to help fund deals for Radamel Falcao and James Rodriguez. Fiorentina have an interest in Marouane Fellaini but the Italians will struggle to match United's valuation. They are waiting on bids for Juan Cuadrado, who United have also watched, but Barcelona are considered favourites for him. Arsenal may be poised to sell another right-back as clubs show interest in Carl Jenkinson. Manager Arsene Wenger has lost Bacary Sagna to Manchester City but quickly identified Mathieu Debuchy as his replacement. However, now England U21 international Jenkinson is attracting enquiries and Arsenal may contemplate a sale. Trading places? Arsenal's Carl Jenkinson (left) is being tracked by a host of Premier League clubs . Goodbye? Debuchy looks set to quit Tyneside after just 18 months in a £12million deal . VIDEO Debuchy confirms Gunners move . Wenger had originally considered loaning out 22-year-old Jenkinson with Newcastle and West Ham among those to have shown an interest. Sunderland were another but they have since recruited Billy Jones from West Bromwich Albion. Arsenal have compiled a list of right-backs after targeting Sagna's replacement so have others on their list they could turn to if a decent bid for Jenkinson arrives. They have been asked to give a trial to Al Ahly right-back Ahmed Fathy. The Egyptian, who had a short spell at Hull City and had trias at Arsenal at 20, is quick and versatile but now 29. He is ready to travel to London after Monday's Egyptian Premier League title decider with Smouha if Arsenal give him the go-ahead. It is not unfeasible that Jenkinson's name will be thrown into discussions over Debuchy's transfer fee but Newcastle would like the cash and have made enquiries for Feyenoord's Daryl Janmaat, City's Micah Richards and Ajax defender Ricardo van Rhijn. Newcastle midfielder Moussa Sissoko is due to hold talks with manager Alan Pardew over his future. Sissoko was linked with Monaco and Liverpool over the weekend although Liverpool say he is not a player who has cropped up in recent conversations. Homecoming: Moussa Sissoko (right, with Mamadou Sakho) arrive back in France after their World Cup exit . Napoli have also been linked but again have other priorities. The 24-year-old is scheduled to fly out with Newcastle to New Zealand for games with Sydney FC and Wellington Phoenix on July 22 and July 26, but those talks with Pardew may see him stay behind to resolve his future with other clubs. Newcastle continue to work on a number of transfer targets with Monaco striker Emmanuel Riviere, an option for West Brom and Stoke, also on their list. Sunderland have a definite interest in signing Jack Rodwell from Manchester City. Manager Gus Poyet is determined to add more quality to his early summer bargains of Costel Pantilimon, Jordi Gomez and Billy Jones and has enquired about the figures for 23-year-old Rodwell. Wants out: Jack Rodwel wants to leave Manchester City to get his career back on track . He is not alone of course with Everton, West Bromwich Albion and Newcastle among others to have asked, while Arsenal also have a tentative interest. Rodwell is desperate to get his career back on track and play more games. City are also still fielding enquiries for Javi Garcia but much may depend on the unsettled Yaya Toure. Should he push for a move it may have a bearing on what City do with Rodwell and Garcia. Sunderland remain keen on Cardiff City's £3m-rated Jordon Mutch while Brighton striker Craig Mackail-Smith has also been discussed as a surprise option. Tom Ince looks poised to agree a move to Hull City despite the late interest from Stoke. On the move: Tom Ince has agreed a contract with Hull City but Stoke City retain an interest . Ince's father, Paul, is understood to be talking to the club to iron out finer details. The fee would still have to be set by a tribunal with Hull hoping topay around £3m to £4m rather than Blackpool's desired £8m. Hull remain in the hunt for Dundee United left-back Andrew Robertson and Tottenham centre-back Michael Dawson but West Ham have also shown interest in Dawson. The player has only just bought a new house in London and staying in the capital appeals although he would prefer it was still with Tottenham. Malaga want Mexico goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa to replace Willy Caballero. Malaga's owner has made a last ditch plea to Caballero asking him to stay rather than join Manchester City but the 32-year-old is still expected in Manchester. Ochoa is a free agent after leaving Ajaccio and made a big impression with his acrobatic saves during the World Cup. Southampton are considering Lorient centre-back Bruno Ecuele Manga.

"A new Syrian airline plans to fly out of Damascus to destinations across the Middle East despite a three year civil war which has devastated the region. Esmail Sharaf, vice commercial manager, said Kinda Airlines will operate out of Damascus International Airport and the coastal city of Latakia. It aims to fly to more than 10 destinations within a year, including the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Iraq, and 'hopefully Lebanon and Jordan'. Syrian army tanks are seen deployed in the Jobar neighbourhood of Damascus . He said the company had registered a Boeing 737-400 from Jordan Aviation and signed a contract for an Airbus 320 with Aeolus Air, a company registered in Gambia and with offices in the United Arab Emirates. Syria's civil war has killed more than 140,000 people since it started in 2011. Sharaf said there had been a lot of demand for a second carrier other than the national airline Syrianair, which he said had flown out of Damascus throughout the conflict. 'Damascus (airport) has been very safe in the last six or seven months,' he said. Kinda Airlines' debut flight was first scheduled for January. It then put back until April 1 but now wont happen until May 1 due to 'documents that are not ready and some paperwork inside Syria.' Flames and smoke raise from burning cars after two bombs exploded, at Qazaz neighborhood in Damascus, Syria . The start-up has also had to deal with wide-ranging European Union, Arab League and U.S. sanctions on Syria. Syrianair has had to ground planes in the past when it was unable to buy new parts for its fleet. '(Sanctions are) making it very, very difficult. Hopefully we have passed through all these difficulties,' Sharaf said. Syrianair maintained a 40-year monopoly until 2008, when parliament approved the creation of Syrian Pearl Airways (SPA), a venture by Rami Makhlouf, Assad's cousin, who is under sanctions. SPA closed only a month after it launched when the Spanish company which leased its planes had to terminate contracts due to U.S. sanctions. Sharaf said Kinda Airlines' three main shareholders were all private Syrian citizens.","Aims to fly to more than 10 destinations within a year including the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Iraq .

"Yaya Toure has risked upsetting Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini by refuting his suggestion he was not fit to play against Burnley. Toure was absent from the matchday squad as City dropped two points and missed a golden opportunity to close the gap on Chelsea at the top of the Premier League. After the match, his Pellegrini claimed that Toure was nursing a groin injury that he picked up at West Brom on Boxing Day and also said he was a major doubt for the home match against Sunderland on Boxing Day. Yaya Toure has taken to Twitter to insist he was rested for Manchester City and was 'not injured; . Toure, however, tweeted on Tuesday night to say: 'Just a note to say the boss rested me for the Burnley game, I am not injured...!! really hope to be involved against Sunderland! #ComeOnCity!' In his post-match press conference on Sunday, Pellegrini had said: 'Yaya Toure was not able to play today. It was a risk for him. The players that played today were the players who were able to. 'Yaya felt a problem at the beginning of the last game against West Bromwich.' Toure may have upset Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini after appearing to contradict him . Toure, pictured playing against West Bromwich Albion on Boxing Day, was absent for the Burnley match . With regards to his chances of making the Sunderland game, Pellegrini answered: 'We will see. We hope that he will be because it was a lesser problem but after 48 hours maybe it is too high a risk to repeat. It is a muscle injury in his groin.' Toure had appeared to have settled down at City after the summer in which he seemed intent on driving a wedge between himself and the champions. In May, Seluk claimed Toure was ‘very upset’ that the club did not present him with a cake for his 31st birthday and also alleged that on a trip to Abu Dhabi, the club’s owners did not shake Toure’s hand. Following the World Cup, Toure - who had, in fact, been presented with two birthday cakes by City - made some rather more damaging allegations, suggesting the club did not allow him compassionate leave to spend time with his terminally ill brother Ibrahim, who died last June. Toure has established himself as one of City's key players but has also had his problems at the Etihad .","Yaya Toure was left out of Manchester City's squad to face Burnley .

"Chris Hughton is the new manager of Brighton after agreeing a three-and-a-half-year deal to replace Sami Hyypia. The Sky Bet Championship strugglers announced the appointment on Twitter on Wednesday morning. The 56-year-old had been out of work since being relieved of his duties by Norwich in April with the club 17th in the Barclays Premier League. Chris Hughton has been named as the new manager of Championship side Brighton & Hove Albion . Hughton has joined the south coast club on a three-and-a-half year contract . Chris Hughton becomes the fifth black manager across the 92 clubs in the professional football leagues, joining: . 1. Fabio Liverani, Leyton Orient . 2. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, Burton Albion . 3. Chris Powell, Huddersfield Town . 4. Keith Curle, Carlisle United . After eight months away from management, Hughton is relishing the opportunity to be back in work. Brighton, beaten in the play-off semi-finals last season, have struggled this time round and go into the new year teetering on the brink of the relegation places. But the former Tottenham, West Ham, Brentford and Republic of Ireland full-back does not think relegation will be an issue come May. 'I'm thrilled to be back in management and Brighton & Hove Albion is a fantastic club, with a first-class infrastructure both in footballing and business terms,' Hughton told the club's official website. 'We've got one very obvious initial challenge, and I am aiming to hit the ground running, but I am confident with the resources at the club we can succeed in retaining our status in the Championship. 'Once that is achieved we can work towards getting the club back challenging at the top end of the division.' Hughton was sacked as Norwich manager towards the end of last season . Sami Hyypia  resigned as manager of Brighton  on December 22 after a dismal start to the season . Brighton chairman Tony Bloom believes Hughton possesses all the tools needed to get Albion back on track, both in the short term and the long term. He told the club's official website, www.seagulls.co.uk: 'Chris has an excellent record in coaching and management. He's hugely respected, both nationally and internationally, and he has great contacts within the game. 'He is someone who has a real wealth of experience in the top two divisions, from nearly 15 years at Spurs as a coach, assistant and interim manager, through to his more recent work in the Premier League and Championship. 'Chris is also a manager who has a track record for developing talent at all levels from academy upwards and will embrace the work we've been doing at the club in this area in recent seasons. The Championship's bottom six, showing Brighton just above the relegation zone . Hughton takes charge of Brighton with the club one place above the relegation zone virtue of goal difference . 'Importantly, we also felt Chris is someone who can improve our immediate situation, while also having the management credentials and skills to plan our long-term future and help us to get back to progressing in the way we have in previous seasons.' Hughton has Championship pedigree, having led Newcastle to the title in 2009-10 and Birmingham to the play-offs two seasons later. He takes over a Brighton outfit struggling at the wrong end of the table, although four points from two games under caretaker boss Nathan Jones means he begins his reign with the club outside of the relegation zone by virtue of goal difference. Hughton's first game in charge will be Saturday's FA Cup third-round tie against Brentford at Griffin Park, where he ended his playing career.","Sami Hyypia left Brighton last week after joining the club in the summer .

"John Carver says Alan Pardew ranks as one of the best managers he has worked with – including Sir Bobby Robson – and has backed him to be a success at Crystal Palace. The Newcastle assistant boss is now in charge of first-team affairs with Pardew set to be unveiled at Selhurst Park. Carver was shocked at the news of Pardew’s exit but believes he will prove a hit at Palace. John Carver has worked under Alan Pardew for four-and-a-half seasons at Newcastle .

He’s up there with them, and I’ve said that on a number of occasions. Carver rates Pardew as highly as former Newcastle manager Sir Bobby Robson . The caretaker boss - pictured here with Steve Stone - has been involved with the club since the early Nineties . ‘He’s a fantastic coach, a great organiser and a great man manager. He left people to get on with their jobs, and delegated responsibility, which is very important.

And he admits he still has aspirations of being the main man.

"For those who feel the Barclays Premier League is becoming too predictable at the top end, it is always worth hanging around for Christmas. There is a reason the English continue to chase leather in the cold while the rest of Europe holidays at this time of year and here, at a rather flabbergasted Etihad Stadium, was it. Two ahead at half-time after goals from David Silva and Fernandinho, Manuel Pellegrini’s team emerged for the second period aware that Chelsea had dropped two points at Southampton and that a 10th successive win in all competitions would set a new club record and take to them to within a point of their great modern rivals.

Less than an hour later, however, City were being booed off by their own supporters while Burnley manager Sean Dyche was marching on to the field to congratulate his players. His team had not quite managed to pull off the victory of the Premier League season so far but they had come strong at the champions to earn a point and prove that it is unwise to try to predict anything at this time of year. Pellegrini — who can’t be much fun round the Christmas dinner table — will try hard to ascertain how exactly this happened. He may wish to start with the fact that Burnley looked fitter than his team. City have more players in their squad than Burnley but it was the home side who were throwing on substitutes in a bid to find some energy and a spark during the second half. Burnley, meanwhile, finished the game with the same 11 they started with. A coincidence? Maybe. But the fact is that City looked leggy as the game became stretched and Burnley who dominated possession for the entire five-minute period added on by referee Kevin Friend. Normally, we would have expected City to fly at Burnley for the 15 minutes that were played after Ashley Barnes equalised in the 81st minute, but during that time the home team had one chance, substitute Stevan Jovetic bringing a sharp, low save from Tom Heaton. Burnley finished the game comfortably and went home with a point they deserved. Despite the fact they were two down at half-time, they had shown enough in the first 45 minutes to suggest they could hurt City. As it transpired, that all proved rather portentous. Manchester City's David Silva (left) scored the opening goal of the match on 23 minutes with a low left-footed shot . Silva (right) watches on as he shoots through the Burnley defence to open the scoring after spinning in the 18-yard box in the first half . Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton can only watch as Silva's shot beats his despairing dive and goes into the net . City led from the 23rd minute and were two ahead shortly after the half hour. They had been first to show and threatened early through central defender Martin Demichelis, Samir Nasri and James Milner. Interestingly, though, Burnley centre forward Danny Ings was already worrying Demichelis’ partner Eliaquim Mangala while Burnley midfielder Dean Marney had brought the first real save of the game from City goalkeeper Joe Hart. Nevertheless, City broke through midway through the half. It was a neat goal from Silva, as he turned on to a Jesus Navas cross and shot low past Heaton in the Burnley goal. Pretty soon City were two goals clear. This time Nasri was the player who was in control of things on the edge of the penalty area and when he decided to shift the ball sideways to Fernandinho the Brazilian stopped it, moved it a foot to his right and drove a perfect shot against the underside of the bar and into the goal. It was a magnificent strike and one that looked to have sealed the result. Had Navas’ subsequent low effort from 12 yards not been saved by Heaton then we probably could have all gone home early.

City boss Manuel Pellegrini raises both fists in the air after the Brazil international's strike puts them 2-0 ahead on Sunday . As it was, Burnley emerged for the second half to score a most peculiar goal and haul themselves back into things. There seemed little danger as Ings delivered a cross-shot from the left but the presence of George Boyd — who appeared to get a slight touch — seemed to confuse Hart, who could only dive over the ball and deflect it into the net. Pellegrini subsequently claimed Boyd had been offside, and he had a point. ‘Maybe we deserve some luck,’ smiled Dyche. From that point, the game began to disintegrate, as matches at this time of year often do. As legs tired, it became stretched and it has to be said that this seemed to suit Burnley more than it did City. Ings might have tested Hart had he not stood on the ball when played clear in the 54th minute, before central defender Jason Shackell headed over from a free-kick.

City, as you would expect, were still active as an attacking force and Nasri brought a fingertip save from Heaton with a low shot from the edge of the area. They were increasingly less than convincing, however, and, when it came, Burnley’s equaliser was not that surprising. Ings had already seen one shot fly wide and Barnes had one of his own blocked by Demichelis before City found themselves pegged back with nine minutes left. A free-kick from deep was lofted into the area and when the two City central defenders could only knock it down, Barnes connected with his right foot and lashed the ball past Hart with venom. City were rather bewildered. This was something they hadn’t expected. Afterwards, Burnley’s Dyche didn’t seem quite as surprised.

"Alan Irvine had to endure a barrage of abuse from his own supporters as he headed down the tunnel at the end of what may prove to be his last game as head coach of West Bromwich Albion. Irvine’s seventh defeat in nine Premier League games was inflicted by two second-half goals from Stoke striker Mame Diouf. Both were deflected, which perhaps sums up the Scot’s luck at present, and time will tell if chairman Jeremy Peace’s notoriously itchy trigger finger holds off long enough for him to stay in charge for the trip to West Ham on New Year’s Day. Afterwards, Irvine insisted that he is still capable of turning the club’s fortunes around but admitted that the decision is out of his hands.

I’m not in control of that. ‘I want to carry on, I want to still do this job and see it turning around. That’s not going to change. We’re all in this together. ‘It’s not really about me, I’m more concerned about the players and the team. I’ ve got to get on with it, there’s no other choice is there? It’s one of those situations where I try to make changes to see if I can help things. You hope they work. Sometimes they do, sometimes they don’t.’ Nearly 3,000 Albion fans made the trip to the Britannia Stadium for this Midlands derby and stayed largely supportive of Irvine until the 63rd minute when he replaced Stephane Sessegnon and James Morrison with Saido Berahino and Silvestre Varela. Irvine later defended the decision by pointing out that both Sessegnon and Morrison have been carrying injuries, but it was met with a chorus of ‘You don’ t know what you’re doing’. When Diouf claimed a fortuitous second goal for Stoke three minutes later, the travelling fans were in open revolt. They hurled abuse at Irvine as he walked past them en route to the dressing-rooms at the end. ‘I don’t know if they would have wanted me to acknowledge them,’ added Irvine. ‘What do you do in those circumstances? ‘I can understand. People are frustrated, I’m frustrated, and so are the players. I can understand them expressing that, it’s the nature of the job.

I stand out there and take it. I’m prepared to take the criticism.’ West Brom had actually played the neater football for a much of a first half short on clear-cut chances. But it was Stoke who made the breakthrough six minutes after the restart with a goal that must have felt like a dagger to the heart for Irvine. Bojan Krkic had possession in midfield and sprayed the ball wide to Erik Pieters who had made an overlapping run on the left. The Dutchman pulled it back to Diouf who took Chris Brunt and Gareth McAuley out of the game by switching the ball from his left foot to his right, and then beat Ben Foster with a low shot that took a slight deflection off Joleon Lescott. West Brom nearly equalised when Asmir Begovic parried Craig Gardner’s close-range effort and McAuley scrambled the loose ball against the post. Within seconds, the game – and possibly Irvine’s future – had been decided. Again Bojan was involved, cutting inside from the left and laying a pass off for Marko Arnautovic. The Austrian tried his luck with a fierce effort from 25 yards and it took a bizarre double deflection off Diouf before rolling inside the post with Foster helpless to keep it out. It secured Stoke’s first back-to-back wins in the league this season as Mark Hughes’s side moved up to 11th place. Aside from a hamstring problem that forced Bojan off towards the end, the only blemish for Stoke was that Diouf will shortly be leaving on international duty with Senegal at the Africa Cup of Nations. ‘We’re going to miss him but hopefully they’ll get knocked out pretty quickly and he won’t miss too many games,’ joked Hughes.

"Swansea City have 'reluctantly' accepted an FA charge against Jonjo Shelvey for elbowing Liverpool's Emre Can on Monday. It means the midfielder will now be handed a three-match ban for violent conduct and a further one-match suspension because it is his second red card of the season. Shelvey initially went unpunished for the clash with Can, despite it occurring directly in front of referee Andre Marriner. Jonjo Shelvey has been charged by the FA for throwing an elbow at Emre Can at Anfield on Monday night . Shelvey catches the Liverpool midfielder in the face during another performance that prompted criticism . Shelvey clearly threw his arm in the direction of Can as Swansea slumped to defeat . Can reacts after being hit in the face with Shelvey's flailing arm . Swansea have been left infuriated that while Shelvey has been sanctioned, Raheem Sterling escaped punishment for an equally obvious infringement in Liverpool's 4-1 win. A Swansea statement read: 'Swansea City has reluctantly accepted the charge issued by The Football Association against Jonjo Shelvey for violent conduct following an incident in Monday night's Barclays Premier League defeat at Liverpool. 'The Football Association said the incident with Liverpool's Emre Can, which happened in front of the referee, 'was not seen by the match officials but caught on video'. 'While the club supports Shelvey's statement that the incident was unintentional, it does not believe the outcome of an appeal would prove positive for the club or player.' Shelvey took to Twitter to explain what happened and insisted he would not set out to hurt an opponent . Shelvey capped off a forgettable evening by scoring an own goal for Liverpool's fourth of the night . Swansea boss Garry Monk also defended Shelvey, saying: 'I spoke to Jonjo on the way home and he said his intention was not to catch the player at all. He said the player was tugging on him and he was just trying to push him away. 'I don't think it was an intentional elbow at all and the referee was perfectly placed. No-one had a better view of the incident than him. He felt it didn't warrant any more action and the game went on.' After Shelvey was booked in the Boxing Day win against Aston Villa, Monk said: 'I have spoken to him a number of times. We can't afford silly bookings and Jonjo has to wise up because that yellow card came from laziness and he has to be better than that.' The 22-year-old watches as his headers finds the back of the net at Anfield . Raheem Sterling will not face any action after pushing Federico Fernandez in the face . But Monk said he had no intention to sell Shelvey - who joined Swansea from Liverpool for £5million in the summer of 2013 - in the January transfer window. 'It is often the case (to sell) when a manager talks about a player,' said Monk. 'But that is absolutely not the case. It was not my intention to give the impression I do not want Jonjo here. 'When I talked about him I was talking about the specific instances where he can do better, in relation to the yellow cards he has picked up. 'He is going to get a lot better and I want that to happen here at Swansea, not anywhere else.'","Jonjo Shelvey appeared to swing an elbow at Emre Can during Swansea's defeat at Liverpool on Monday night .

"Brazil legend Ronaldo appears to be trying to keep everybody happy after revealing that his ultimate team contains three Argentines, two Real Madrid heroes, two ex-Barcelona stars and a couple of Luis Enrique's current squad. Speaking to Spanish newspaper Mundo Deportivo, the 38-year-old, who also enjoyed a spell at the Nou Camp, picked just two of his compatriots in his all-time dream team. Opting for a fashionable 3-4-3 diamond formation, Ronaldo chose Athletic Bilbao legend Jose Angel Iribar in goal. The former Spain No 1 made 466 appearances for the Basque side, helping them to Copa del Rey triumphs in 1969 and 1973. Former Real Madrid striker Ronaldo has revealed his ultimate dream team to Spanish paper Mundo Deportivo . Jose Angel Iribar, pictured in training with Spain in 1975, gets the nod as Ronaldo's No 1 goalkeeper . The Brazilian's back- three consists of his former international team-mate Cafu, ex-West Germany captain Franz Beckenbauer and AC Milan favourite Paolo Maldini. Ronaldo played alongside Cafu for Brazil for 12 years and enjoyed a season with Maldini at the San Siro in 2007-08. Former Bayern Munich defender Beckenbauer makes the team after winning four Bundesliga titles and the 1974 World Cup. Ronaldo's midfield is dominated by former Barcelona and Real Madrid greats, although he reserves a spot for former Spain midfielder Xavi, who is still representing the Catalan club. Ronaldo (left) played with Cafu (right) for 12 years with Brazil, winning the World Cup in 1994 and 2002 . AC Milan legend Paolo Maldini (left) and German World Cup winner Franz Beckenbauer make the team . Argentina hero Diego Maradona and Johan Cruyff, both of whom pulled on the famous blue and red shirt, are given spots on either wing in Ronaldo's XI. France World Cup winner Zinedine Zidane, who played alongside Ronaldo at the Bernabeu between 2002 and 2006, is placed in an attacking midfield role behind a deadly three-man attack. The ex-Inter Milan forward opts for another Argentine, Lionel Messi, wide on the right, Real Madrid legend Alfredo di Stefano through the middle and Brazil great Pele on the left. Ronaldo opted for Diego Maradona in his team despite Brazil's fierce rivalry with Argentina . Former Real Madrid midfielder Zinedine Zidane (left) and Barcelona pass-master Xavi are both included . Brazil legend Pele (left) celebrates scoring against Italy in the 1970 World Cup final in Mexico . It's no surprise to see Pele, undoubtedly one of Ronaldo's heroes, in the side, while he will have been made well aware of Di Stefano's goal-scoring achievements in the Spanish capital. But there's no place for Real's current Ronaldo, Cristiano, despite his extraordinary goal-scoring form for Los Blancos since joining them from Manchester United in 2009. The Portuguese star is La Liga's top scorer with 25 goals in just 14 games this season but he misses out to Messi, who will also be looking to beat him to the Ballon d'Or in January.

"Despite admitting it was a late foul that could have left his player with a broken leg, Gus Poyet offered a defence, of sorts, for Fabian Delph, after the midfielder received Aston Villa’s third straight red in four games. The Sunderland manager believes Delph’s reputation for tough tackling precedes him and may have contributed to his early exit for a mistimed challenge on Jordi Gomez. Poyet was Dennis Wise’s assistant at Leeds when Delph was a teenager unafraid to make his presence felt on the training pitches. At Villa Park, his attempt to win possession three minutes after the break went wrong and instead he left his studs on Gomez’s ankle. Referee Martin Atkinson showed no hesitation in producing the red card. England midfielder Fabian Delph (left) is sent off for a rash challenge on Jordi Gomez shortly after half-time .

Fabian Delph controlled the right side of midfield before his dismissal - CLICK HERE for more detailed stats from our brilliant Match Zone . ‘It’s the way he plays football, his reputation,’ said Poyet. ‘Sometimes players can make three or four fouls and only get yellow, then Fabian makes one tackle that looks a little bit dangerous: boom, he gets a red. It’s unlucky. ‘Saying that, if you stop the video you will see his studs in his ankle. Another three inches it could be a broken leg. I think that’s why the referee gave it, but sometimes you get away with those. ‘I was at Leeds with him. I can tell you Dennis Wise received a few from Fab. I really like him. I feel sad for him today. I think he didn’t deserve that. It was a little bit dangerous and we need to be fair with the referee as well.’ Delph’s dismissal gave Sunderland an opportunity to snatch three points from a dire game of little quality. But even though Gomez hit the post late on with a driven shot, it was Villa with the better chances to win the game. ‘We tried too hard, went a little bit crazy,’ explained Poyet. Paul Lambert’s side are well-versed this season in playing a man light. Against Tottenham in November, Christian Benteke’s red saw three points turn to none, while another defeat followed Kieran Richardson’s dismissal for a wild lunge on West Bromwich Albioin striker Stephane Sessegnon earlier this month.

Sunderland striker Connor Wickham (centre) stretches to try and steal the ball from Aston Villa's Andreas Weimann . Sunderland forward Wickham (left) rises to clear the ball during an Aston Villa set piece . But against Manchester United eight days ago, Villa coped impressively to hold on to a draw after being shorn of Gabby Agbonlahor with half an hour left to play. That red was later rescinded and Lambert said he would view video footage before deciding whether to appeal against Delph’s red too. Villa limited Sunderland to scant openings, the clearest coming in the 68th minute when Adam Johnson crossed for Emanuele Giaccherini. The Italian’s attempt was blocked by his team-mate Connor Wickham, who reacted by backheeling a shot that required Leandro Bacuna to block near the line. Lambert sent on Jack Grealish to provide some much-needed pace and the 19-year-old made the kind of impact that may see him get more minutes against Crystal Palace on New Year’s Day. He fired a shot narrowly wide, nearly forced an own goal from Santiago Vergini and whipped a corner that Ron Vlaar met with a glancing header to test Costel Pantilimon. Lambert appealed enthusiastically for a penalty in added time when Pantilimon collided with Benteke but Atkinson, on this occasion, was unmoved. The point is a positive given the circumstances but another blank means Villa have scored just 11 goals in 18 games — the lowest total in the Barclays Premier League. Lambert is concerned about the growing dismissals, but insists goals will come. Like Poyet, he said playing twice in 48 hours sapped his team’s energy. ‘Two games in three games is nonsense,’ said Lambert, before switching his focus to that worrying trend of red cards. ‘It doesn’t look great,’ he acknowledged. ‘The lads are committed to a challenge. We’re not a dirty team.’ Play is delayed while medical staff take care of injured Sunderland midfielder Jordi Gomez .

"Andy Cohen may be on the up with the release of his latest book - but he took a short trip down last night, riding on a fireman's pole. The TV personality, 46, is seen taking the plunge inside the restored firehouse home of fellow host Anderson Cooper, where he partied alongside guests including Monica Lewinsky. Clutching the pole as onlookers wish him well, Cohen flashes a big smile before letting himself slide down to the floor below. Scroll down for video . Ready to slide: TV personality Andy Cohen flashed a smile before dropping down the fireman's pole at Anderson Cooper's house as Padma Lakshmi recorded . He ended up on the floor below, giving a glimpse at how fun life must be in the Cooper house . After Andy went, Padma hitched up her dress and gave it a go, landing in Anderson's open arms . After he lands, the suited guest can be heard shouting back up 'You've got to do it! It's so easy!'. Moments after Cohen went Lakshmi hitched up her dress and gave it a go, sliding down to the open arms of Anderson, who had by then changed into a casual gray t-shirt. The clip is a rare insight into Cooper's converted home in Greenwich Village, New York City. He bought the firehouse in 2010 for $4.3million and gut renovated it, making into his personal home. Footage uploaded to Instagram by Top Chef host Padma Lakshmi shows that Cooper's home - which still reads 'Fire Patrol' on the front - has retained much of its original character. Other guests cheerleading for Cohen's new book - the Andy Cohen Diaries - included Real Housewife NeNe Leakes and Lewinsky, who thrust herself back into the limelight last month by speaking about her affair with President Clinton. There were also a host of Cohen's other boldfaced name friend, including Ellen Barkin, Victor Garber, Ali Wentworth, Jessica Seinfeld, Sandra Bernhard, Mark Consuelos and Kelly Ripa. Mark appeared to be one of the few husbands who came, as Jerry Seinfeld and Ali's husband George Stephanopolous were missing from photos. Conversion: Cooper lives in a $4.3million former firehouse in New York City's Greenwich Village . Also filming the trip down the pole with her smartphone was fellow party guest Kelly Ripa .

How meta! The moment the trio posed for the selfie was also captured on camera . Lewinsky posed with Leakes and Cohen in another Instagram snap from Cohen's account, which he termed 'the selfie to end all selfies'. Cohen's new tome, subtitled A Deep Look at a Shallow Year, is awash with celebrity gossip and behind-the-scenes tidbits from the last 12 months of his life on air. The new release is set to have a particular focus on the New Housewives stars, with whom is said to have become 'codependent' - and includes details of how he persuaded Bethenny Frankel to return to the New York City edition of the show. Padma put down her phone to also pose for a photo with the honoree and his good friends Mark Consuelos and wife Kelly Ripa . Everyone loved posing with the pole: Lewinsky, Jessica Seinfeld, Ripa,  Cohen, Alexandra Wentworth and comic Sandra Bernhard couldn't resist another photo opportunity by the house's fun feature . Smiles! Jessica Seinfeld posed up with the host and honoree - but it seemed her husband Jerry missed the party. Also Thursday Jerry told NBC News that he is uncomfortable with some social interactions and may be on the autism spectrum . Cooper, who hosted the bash, joked that the book was so scandal-ridden it made him want to sue Cohen. In a snippet for the book jacket, Cooper said: [Cohen] 'has more genuinely funny and surprising encounters with celebrities and sublebrities in a day than I do all year. 'Then my name popped up. Now I just want to sue him.' Tequila fresca? No word if Cohen was drinking his show's signature drink at the bash, which was also attended by actor Vincent Garber, left .

"A relegation scrap at Crystal Palace might have seemed like an attractive proposition for Alan Pardew with Newcastle trailing inside five minutes and the locals again restless in fear of a fifth straight loss. In fact, it still might, regardless of the turnaround which followed. But come full-time, Pardew – bookies’ favourite for the vacant manager’s position at Selhurst Park - was applauding those same supporters who had threatened to turn in the wake of Arouna Kone’s early opener and embracing the players who have repeatedly bailed him out this season. It should have been a cause for celebration. Instead, Pardew refused to speak to the press after the game, fueling speculation he is tempted by a return to London. No reason was given by club officials but it is thought he did not want to answer questions on the link to his former club.

Assistant John Carver would offer nothing more than saying Pardew was ‘happy and delighted’ by the result which halted their losing sequence. The victory, though, was not without its good fortune. Papiss Cisse should have been sent off after landing his elbow into the jaw of Seamus Coleman four minutes before he pounced to cancel out Kone’s strike. And Toffess boss Roberto Martinez fumed: ‘He shouldn’t have been on the pitch (when he equalised). It’s unacceptable. ‘The referee should have seen that. It is an action you don't want to see on a football pitch. It is a clear elbow to try and hurt someone. ‘I don’t think that was the reason why we lost but it would have been a completely different game.’ Cisse could well face retrospective FA action but they cannot take away the points which lift the Magpies up to ninth.

Substitute Kevin Mirallas did spark hope of a comeback six minutes from time but the hosts held on for their first win since upsetting league leaders Chelsea three weeks ago. And Carver said: ‘Alan’s happy. He’s delighted. It’s a fantastic win for us. We’ve been on a run of games where we haven’t won but this was one of our best performances of recent times. ‘When you look at where we were after the first half dozen games of the season (bottom) we’re delighted to be here (ninth).’ For Everton, they have now lost six of their last eight to leave Martinez under pressure. And the Spaniard said: ‘When you are in a period when nothing goes in your favour you need to be strong. ‘We do need to build some momentum in the league. We haven’t had that this season.'

Cisse (left) and Coleman exchange words during the match after the Senegal international's elbowing incident . It had all started so perfectly. Aiden McGeady slid a pass in behind Yoan Gouffran and  Coleman swept first time onto the boot of Kone – making his first league start for the club after 14 months out with a knee injury - who applied an equally prompt finish from six yards. One criticism of Newcastle this season has been their execution from corner-kicks. In the aftermath of one failed delivery – Perez scuffing to the near post – one home fan hollered, ‘What do you do on the training pitch, Alan?’. On 37 minutes that supporter had his answer. Colback worked the ball short to Cheick Tiote and they again swapped passes before the latter hoisted a cross to the far post. There Mike Williamson peeled away from his minder to hook back to Cisse and he stabbed home for his ninth of the season. Cisse, of course, was lucky to be on the field. Newcastle had finished the first half much the stronger and that was how they duly began the second. Sissoko escaped down the right and centred and, with Gareth Barry under pressure from Cisse, the Everton man inadvertently shinned towards his own bottom corner where Robles somehow got down to flip around the upright. It mattered not, within 60 seconds the Spaniard was picking the ball out of the Gallowgate End net, undone by compatriot Perez.

The 21-year-old won an admirer in Sir Alex Ferguson for his performance at Old Trafford on Boxing Day and a few more might well be taking note after this cunning finish. McGready gifted possession to Tiote who zipped a pass slightly behind Perez just outside the area. That was no problem for the in-form frontman, scooping the ball into his path before dropping a shoulder inside two blue shirts and locating the bottom corner to leave Robles motionless. Ross Barkley was on for Everton in a bid to inject some creativity but he ended up gifting the game-clinching third to Colback. Janmaat crossed from the right and Barkley, having backtracked to intercept, was left wishing he hadn’t bothered when he miskicked and Colback stole in to poke through the legs of Robles. Mirallas set up a nervy finish when he chipped over Jak Alnwick having been sprung clear by Baines’ throughball but United held on for an invaluable victory. Not that Pardew wanted to talk about it.

"Jordan Henderson has hailed Brendan Rodgers as ‘one of the top managers in the world’ and backed Liverpool to qualify for the Champions League again after the Anfield revival continued with the club’s biggest win of the season over Swansea on Monday night. After struggling for much of the first half of the campaign, Liverpool revived memories of last season’s barnstorming performances as they won 4-1 to make it seven points from three games over Christmas. Only two weeks ago, Rodgers took his team to Bournemouth in the Capital One Cup with a question mark hanging over his future at Anfield. But Henderson, who captained Liverpool against Swansea in the absence of Steven Gerrard, believes they have got the best possible man for the job. Brendan Rodgers is 'one of the top managers in the world', claims Jordan Henderson . Henderson applauds the Anfield faithful after Liverpool's 4-1 win against Swansea on Monday . ‘The manager has been fantastic ever since he came to the club,’ said the England midfielder. ‘He’s working really hard for us on the training field to ensure that tactically we are better and improving all the time. ‘It’s up to us as players to ensure we put that into practice on the pitch and we definitely did that against Swansea. We got our just rewards for that. ‘It’s been hard on everyone. We’ve gone from winning every week to not winning as often. But the manager has always been the same. He has always looked to improve things on the training field. ‘For me, he’s one of the top managers in the world. We just have to make sure we keep on putting in the hard work and listening to what he has to say. If we do that then we’ll keep going in the right direction. Rodgers shouts instructions to his team during the Premier League clash against Swansea . ‘He has proved he’s a top-class manager and everyone buys into it because we know he’s so good tactically. ‘He’s outstanding at seeing what’s happening in games and changing it whenever he needs to. You can see that. If it’s not going right in the first 10 to 15 minutes he will change something.’ Rodgers switched Emre Can to centre-back against Swansea and played Adam Lallana and Philippe Coutinho alongside Raheem Sterling in a three-man attack. A high-intensity performance brought a deserved victory that lifted Liverpool up to eighth place in the table at the halfway stage of the season, five points off the top-four. 26-year-old midfielder Adam Lallana scored twice during Liverpool's 4-1 victory . Henderson embraces Lallana after the midfielder puts Liverpool into a 2-0 lead . Asked if they can rejoin Europe’s elite in the Champions League next season, Henderson said: ‘Of course we can. We’ve got quality players here. You saw against Swansea that when we play well we look a top, top side. We just need to be more consistent and make sure we do that every game. ‘We were on the front foot, closing down really well and we were a real threat going forward. Everyone has to be on board when you press high up the pitch like that. 'I felt as though everyone was, especially from the front with Raheem, Philippe and Adam. Rodgers looks on a the Liverpool players are put through their paces on Tuesday . ‘They worked really hard on the press and then it was easy for us squeezing up behind. We did that really well and we need to keep on doing it. ‘We want to ensure the second half of the season is much better than the first half. We have to keep playing like that. If we do, then the results will follow. ‘I don’t mind all the games coming together in a short period like this. You want to be playing in big games. When they come thick and fast it's a good chance to get points on the board, especially when you need to climb the league.’","Brendan Rodgers is one of the best in the world, claims Jordan Henderson .

"The FA have announced that it had fined Aston Villa £30,000 for failing to control their players in the wake of Gabriel Agbonlahor's dismissal against Manchester United. A number of Villa players remonstrated with referee Lee Mason after the Villa forward was deemed the guilty party in what appeared to be a fair challenge for the ball between him and United's ex-Villa winger Ashley Young. The FA said Villa had also been warned as to their future conduct. Gabriel Agbonlahor was shown a red card against Manchester United but his ban has since been overturned . Ashley Young lies on the turf, but later told keeper Brad Guzan he expected the foul to be awarded Villa's way . Agbonlahor was sent off for using ‘excessive force’ in this challenge with Young in Aston Villa's 1-1 draw . Agbonlahor had recently seen the red card rescinded by the FA after an appeal by Paul Lambert's side. The Villa forward was sent off for using ‘excessive force’ in a challenge with Ashley Young but the United player later told Brad Guzan he expected the foul to be awarded Villa’s way. Lambert expressed his pleasure at the outcome, given Agbonlahor’s importance to the team and the absences of Ashley Westwood, Nathan Baker, Philippe Senderos and Kieran Richardson. 'It is great for us,’ Lambert said. 'I said at the time I didn't think it was a red card and everyone's assumption was the same. Ex-referees have come out and said it wasn't. 'So your own common sense told you it wasn't a red card. Gabby is playing really well at the minute so we hoped it would be rescinded. 'We are still without a few - Westy, Nathan, Senderos and Richardson - so we didn't want another one out.

"While many people will have their sights set on losing the extra pounds gained over Christmas in 2015, Sportsmail's reporters have an entirely different list of New Year's resolutions. Instead of letting us in on their personal plans, our experts have revealed what they'd like to see happen in sport over the next 12 months. From moving the FA Cup semi-finals away from Wembley to tougher laws on drug abuse, here's some interesting ways to improve the sports we love. MATT BARLOW . The usual wishes: . 1) A little less diving and play-acting from the grown men who still insist on cheating their fellow professionals. 2) More opportunities for British players and coaches at the highest level. 3) Move the FA Cup semi-finals away from Wembley and give them their own day, with no other football. Arsenal won last season's FA Cup at Wembley but Matt Barlow wants the semi-finals played elsewhere . DEREK LAWRENSON . I'm proud supporters at my club Liverpool are leading the fight against the totally absurd cost of attending football matches - and I truly hope they win. The game is in grave danger of completely losing touch with its working-class base. A section of Liverpool fans hold up a banner to protest about ticket prices at Anfield in October . JEFF POWELL . Can we stop writing off boxers if they are defeated once? As Oscar De La Hoya says, with half an eye on Floyd Mayweather: 'There is no shame in losing as long as you give it your all. The pity is when the best don't fight each other. Muhammad Ali, Sugar Ray Robinson, Sugar Ray Leonard and Julio Cesar Chavez were all beaten but are still honoured as all-time greats in the Hall of Fame.' Floyd Mayweather is undefeated in 47 fights but could face a tough test against Manny Pacquiao in 2015 . JONATHAN MCEVOY . Administrators to get serious about drug abuse in sport. A brilliant start would be to disband or reconfigure the World Anti-Doping Agency – a weedy organisation masquerading as a crusader. Same goes for a number of governing bodies, who are long on lip-service and short on action. MIKE DICKSON . Tennis needs to get up to speed with modern demands and habits this coming year by making a decisive effort to cut out the amount of dead time in matches. Some or all of the following areas need to be addressed and the recent IPTL showed the way: time between points, net cords on serve, spurious toilet breaks, spurious call-ons for the physio, unnecessary warm-ups. Separately, I would also like to see more money allocated to drug testing. I am more optimistic on both counts than for some time but will not be holding my breath. Mike Dickson wants tennis to be quicker in 2015 with physio call-ons only when truly necessary . ROB DRAPER . My one wish for football – Sepp Blatter to stand down as FIFA president followed by a resignation of the entire FIFA executive committee and an invitation to an organisation such as Transparency International to make proposals on how football governance should be restructured. FIFA is a corrupt 20th century institution staggering on in the 21st century. The game is sick to its core – but the glitz and glamour is so beguiling we scarcely notice. Rob Draper wants FIFA president Sepp Blatter to step down and the FIFA executive committee to resign . PAUL NEWMAN . Let's see an end to nasty, mindless sledging on the pitch in the wake of the Phillip Hughes tragedy. Play hard, yes, and certainly don't hold back on bowling bouncers. But do we need to see so much of the snarling and foul-mouthed abuse which is on the increase in the game, which was even seen in the first Test in Adelaide between Australia and India immediately after the terrible accident involving Hughes. The greatest cricketing theatre comes when a fast bowler stares at a batsman after a bouncer, like Curtly Ambrose used to, not aims mindless abuse at him. Paul Newman hopes there is no more foul-mouthed abuse on cricket pitches around the world next year . MARCUS TOWNEND . For the BHA to prune the fixture list. The equation is simple – too many races, too few runners. The result has been a spate of poorly patronised meetings which have particularly blighted jump racing in the final few weeks of the year. The focus will be on AW Flat meetings in the opening days of the New Year to see how well they are supported. The chances of my wish coming true? On a par with Father Christmas coming down my chimney!","Footballers to stop diving and start acting like grown men would be good .
More opportunities for British players and coaches would also be welcome .

"Two men in a helicopter have saved a birthing southern right whale in Western Australia from an imminent shark attack- and luckily, one of the men on board was able to photograph the extraordinary sequence of events . On Wednesday, tourism operator Sean Blocksidge was flying on a helicopter with his friend, helicopter pilot Brett Campany, taking aerial photographs off the coast of Cowaramup Bay, south of the Margaret River in Western Australia. From a great height, they first spotted the calving whale - and almost immediately after, a predator shark heading straight for the helpless mammal in the shallows. 'As we flew by the Wilyabrup cliffs about 1500 feet in the air, Brett and I spotted something. It looked like a really big fish from that high up! On closer inspection, we realised that it was a Southern Right Whale giving birth,' Mr Blocksidge told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . A story in photographs: From 1500 feet, Sean Blocksidge and Brett Campany spotted what looked like 'a really big fish' (photographed from the helicopter, pictured bottom right) close to shore off the coast of Cowaramup Bay. The friends soon realised that they had found a southern right whale giving birth to her calf. Brett Campany dropped the helicopter down to herd the shark back out to deeper water and away from a calving southern right whale off the coast of Cowaramup Bay . 'We get more than 30,000 whales migrating along the west coast at peak season every year. We see whales all the time, you'll see at least one a day. 'So you get to understand whale behaviour. I'd seen a whale calving quite recently so I knew what was happening when I saw the whale on Wednesday. You could tell that she was giving birth because they come close to shore and have certain mannerisms.They come close to the water's surface and arch their backs.' It was then that the pair spotted the bronze whaler shark and with only seconds to react, took it upon themselves to prevent the inevitable tragedy. Whilst watching the pregnant whale in the shallows, Mr Campany spotted a four-metre shark (pictured) in the distance, heading straight for the whale . 'We could see a shark moving down the beach. You could tell, it was coming quite quickly. It was massive, about four metres long and heading straight for the southern right. 'We only had seconds to think about it. There was no time, but we had to do something.' 'I mean, I'm all for letting nature do it's thing. We wouldn't normally interfere at all but it would be too sad if we left the shark to attack the brand new calf right after the poor mother gave birth.' Mr Campany dropped the helicopter down and closed in on the shark, to chase it away from the vulnerable calving whale and towards deeper waters. Throughout the whole ordeal, Mr Blocksidge kept taking photographs - a courageous task considering his chopper door was open the entire time. 'It was pretty cool to see what the helicopter could do. We turned sideways at one point when we were directly over the shark. I'd left my door open while I took photographs to get a better shot, so I was pretty nervous when I was hanging sideways directly over the shark with nothing between us!' 'It all happened so quickly but I just tried to keep clicking to get some photos. The shark high-tailed it out of there very quickly, he got a pretty big fright, I think,' Mr Blocksidge said. Brett Campany dropped the helicopter down to herd the shark back out to deeper water and away from the calving southern right whale. Sean Blocksidge tried to take photographs - a courageous task, with his door open and the helicopter on its side while they hovered over the shark . 'We couldn't believe what was happening, things just kept popping up before our eyes, it didn't seem real!' said Mr Blocksidge. 'We were near Williaborough beach and landed on the sand to give the whale plenty of space, because we didn't want to disturb her. We didn't want to stress the poor whale while she gave birth, but we were keeping an eye on her to make sure she was okay. Mr Campany landed the helicopter on the sand once the shark had been herded away from the whale and out to deeper water. From a safe distance, the men both watched the whale in the shallows . 'A pod of about 20 dolphins arrived to circle the birthing whale, it was really quite amazing - like the call of nature. We decided to fly off before the whale gave birth because we knew she was safe. The dolphins made a ring around her to protect her. 'We had a laugh and said well, we can leave because we know the dolphins are here to manage the maternity ward for the night!' said Mr Blocksidge. 'It was just amazing - nature at work. It's something you never forget.' 'It was like nature's call!' Mr Blockside and Mr Campany were amazed when a pod of around 20 dolphins arrived, encircling the expectant mother whale to protect her. The men left, assured the whale was safe with the dolphins there to 'manage the maternity ward.' 'It was like nature's call!'

"Quadruplets born to a Dallas-area minister and his wife already share something with their father. The boy and three girls delivered Monday at Baylor Regional Medical Center at Grapevine arrived on their dad's 36th birthday. Josh Hall, who's a youth pastor at Gateway Church in Fort Worth, said he's 'ecstatic' about his expanded family. Brooks, Sadie, Elle and Ivy join two sisters - 4-year-old Zoe and 2-year-old Kaytlin. Scroll down for video... Forty finders and forty toes: A tiny hand reaches out for Dad . Happy Birthday! Joshua Hall will never forget his 36th birthday when his wife Anna Hall delivered quadruplets at Baylor Regional Medical Center at Grapevine . Proud dad: Elizabeth Watkins, RN, settles newborn Hall quad in NICU while Joshua Hall, father of the quads, watches. The four babies were delivered at Baylor Regional Medical Center at Grapevine on May 5 to Anna and Joshua Hall, Fort Worth residents . Planning ahead: The couple announced to the world on Facebook that they were having four babies earlier this year . Before there were six: Josh and Anna Hall pictured here n a beach holiday before their children were even though of! A Baylor spokeswoman on Thursday said mother Anna and the quadruplets, born more than a month premature, are in good condition. Hospital officials say Brooks at birth weighed 3 pounds 11 ounces, Sadie was 2 pounds 15 ounces, Elle was 3 pounds 6 ounces and Ivy was 3 pounds 5 ounces. Elle and Ivy are identical twins. 'We feel very blessed to welcome these four new children into our family,'  the proud dad said. The family already has two other girls, 4-year-old Zoe and 2-year-old Kaytlin. One of four: The quads - three girls and one boy - arrived May 5, which is Mr. Hall's birthday . Big family: Joshua and Anna Hall welcomed quadruplets on Monday, Joshua's birthday, The babies - one boy and three girls -- are the first set of quadruplets ever born at Baylor Regional Medical Center at Grapevine . The infants started arriving at 1:58 p.m. Brooks came first and weighed in 3 pound s,11 ounces, followed by Sadie at 2 pounds, 15 ounces . Recovering: Mrs. Hall had been hospitalized on bed rest at Baylor Grapevine for several weeks . My firstborn son: Dad, Joshua, watches over Brooks who was first to arrive. The only boy to arrive in the quads that were born . 'It was an exciting afternoon here,' said hospital President Steve Newton. Nurse manager Susan West said that the hospital delivered more than 2,500 babies last year. 'Since this is the hospital's first set of quads,' West said, 'this birth is extra special to us.' The average quads are born at about 29.5 weeks, said Dr. Sherri Kappler, medical director of the hospital's Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Anna Hall 'was able to reach almost 32 weeks, which was great news for the babies,' Dr. Kappler said. A full-term baby is born between 37 and 42 weeks of gestation. Anything prior to that is considered premature. About 10 percent of all newborns require special monitoring in the NICU, making sure that they are breathing, feeding and developing properly. Memorable: Nurse manager Susan West said that the hospital delivered more than 2,500 babies last year. 'Since this is the hospital's first set of quads,' West said, 'this birth is extra special to us.' Reaching out: The parents of quads, Joshua and Anna Hall reach out to feel their newborns . Sleep tight: The babies will remain in hospital for a few more weeks as they are looked over . Visitors: Parents of six, Joshua and Anna Hall take a look at their newborns . The quad babies will remain in the hospital for a few weeks. 'Because these babies are often very small, they need special care to aid in growth and development before they can go home. Breathing and feeding may be difficult for these tiny patients,' the hospital said. 'We are just praying everybody is going to be good sleepers good eaters. It is going to be fun,' added mother Anna. In March, Steven and Michelle Seals gave birth to quintuplets, four girls and a boy, at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas. Spiritual: 'We feel very blessed to welcome these four new children into our family,' Josh Hall said. Checking up: Most quadruplet pregnancies last 29.5 weeks.

"A suburban Detroit police officer has been fired and a handful of others are under investigation after surveillance footage showed a cop cut off a young mother’s weave. Charda Gregory’s weave was crudely chopped off late last year by former Warren Police Officer Bernadette Najor using a pair of scissors after she was arrested for trashing a seedy motel on the notorious 8 Mile Road. The weave was removed, Ms Najor told her superiors, because Ms Gregory was deemed a suicide risk – reasoning that police commissioner Jere Green told WXYZ ‘makes no sense.’ SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Busted: Former Warren Police Officer Bernadette Najors is seen cutting out and yanking on Charda Gregory's hair . Scissors: The clippers used by the disgraced cop can be clearly seen in the video . ‘There’s a real simple thing: it’s called right and wrong.  And to me this is something that I won’t tolerate,’ Mr Green told the station. ; “I don’t buy that’s the proper way to treat a human being. ‘I don’t think it’s decent, I don’t think there was any reason to do it, and when I look at it – that bothers me,’ he continued. The disturbing footage captured in November first shows Ms Gregory unable to stand straight up, she told the station she was drugged during a party that evening. Ms Najors is shown pushing Ms Gregory multiple times before she and three fellow officers drag the woman to a holding chair and strap down her limbs. 'Bald in some spots': Ms Gregory claims she can't grow all of her hair back because the officer ripped it out by the roots . Write caption here . Drugged and taken here: Ms Gregory claims she was drugged at the party and taken to this seedy motel on the notorious 8 Mile Road . The disgraced officer then pulls out a pair of scissors and begins chopping off large chunks of the restrained woman’s hair, the pain is so intense her legs flail in agony. ‘She took it upon herself to get the scissors.  And for whatever reason, decided that she was going to butcher my client,’ lawyer Paul Misukewicz said. The demeaning ordeal is not finished until Ms Najors finishes by forcibly yanking a big chunk of hair from Ms Gregory’s head – which she says left her bald in spots as a result of the hair being pulled out by the roots. ‘She’s a very horrible person,’ Ms Gregory said. ‘I guess the best way to describe it would be sadistic,’ her attorney added.’ There’s absolutely no reason for it.  And it’s demeaning’ The officer was initially placed on leave by Mr Green but then fired, he said. It was not her first disciplinary action. 'I don't think it's decent': Warren Police Commissioner Jere Green says he fired Officer Najors because the incident disturbed him . Confronted: Ms Najors threatened to 'call the police' when chased down by a WXYZ reporter in a local parking lot . Documents uncovered by WXYZ showed she had been suspended in the past for being ‘untruthful.’ When confronted in a local shopping center by a WXYZ reporter, the former officer shouted that she would ‘call the police’ if the camera wasn’t taken off of her. The charges originally brought against Ms Gregory have since been dropped, and the other officers involved are being investigated as to why they did not intervene despite reporting the incident to superiors.","Charda Gregory was arrested late last year and accused of trashing a seedy motel room on 8 Mile Road .

"A Montreal man who believed for months that he was going to be the father of quintuplets has spoken out about the moment he discovered his girlfriend's entire pregnancy was a lie. Paul Servat, 35, had his dream dashed by doctors in hospital on Wednesday after his girlfriend, Barbara Bienvenue, 37, had been admitted to give birth. A nurse produced a file of Bienvenue's blood work to show Servat that not only wasn't it his girlfriend's delivery day, she was never actually carrying children, according to The Toronto Sun. Bienvenue is now undergoing a psychological evaluation and is believed to be suffering from pseudocyesis, or a phantom pregnancy, in which sufferers can exhibit all of the symptoms of a pregnancy but with no baby. A friend of Servat's has alleged Bienvenue pulled the same stunt with another man in 2010. Torn apart: Paul Servat said the concept of becoming a father to five children had consumed his entire life, only to be told his girlfriend, Barbara Bienvenue, was never actually pregnant. His is pictured here in what was meant to be the nursery, inside his home in Montreal . Just a few weeks earlier, Savat was all-smiles as he and girlfriend Barbara Bienvenue planned for the arrival of their children, even setting up a Facebook to document the experience . 'She let me choose the names,' Servat told QMI Agency from the baby room in his home, which was filled with five adorned cribs. 'I lost everything, it was my whole life.' Servat said Bienvenue's baby story lasted 34 weeks, after she had surprised her new beau in September with news that she was expecting. They had only been dating for two months at the time. 'We were so happy,' Servat said. 'Even my parents, they were so looking forward to having grandchildren.' As weeks passed Bienvenue told Servat she was expecting twins, then triplets, then quadruplets and finally the stunning news that there were five babies in her belly. A Facebook page was made to document the pregnancy and, eventually, display the gifts that the couple received from their neighbors and local businesses. 'I used my personal and professional contacts to get her sponsorships. Others gave her all sorts of clothes or furniture,' a friend of 35-year-old Barbara told The Toronto Sun. The first person to become suspicious of the situation was Genevieve Laflamme who recently gave birth to triplets. 'I gave her tips on how to handle it, where to get financial support, where to get sponsors for diapers,' Ms Laflamme told CTV. Barbara Bienvenue is now undergoing a physic evaluation. A friend of her boyfriend has alleged she has faked a pregnancy before with another man . She reportedly started to question Barbara's version of events when she found unspecified holes in her story. One of the clearest examples that something was awry came just a week before Barbara's alleged due date when she told Ms Laflamme that a new ultrasound showed that she was having quintuplets. The fact that she was up and moving so close to her alleged due date should have also come as a sign of trouble. A full term single pregnancy is 37 weeks, but women carrying multiple children regularly go into labor or doctor-mandated bed rest months before that. Then on Wednesday, the supposed scheduled delivery date, Servat found out the truth. 'The doctors told me it was a phantom pregnancy,' he said. Back to the original owners: Paul has kept the Facebook group active in order to try to return the gifts he and his now-ex girlfriend received for the 'babies' What remains: Paul only learned that his girlfriend was never pregnant when he went to the hospital for what he believed was going to be the birth of his four- or five- children . Bienvenue is now under psychiatric observation. Servat said she was so convinced she was pregnant that her belly swelled, she began lactating and even had morning sickness. Servat said he plans to give back all the presents they had received or donate them. 'I'll return all these things to people who sent them or give them (away),' Servat said. 'I'm a good person and I have nothing to do with these lies.'","Paul Servat, 35, met Barbara Bienvenue, 37, online last summer .

"With Crystal Palace in the Premier League relegation zone and in the worst form slump of any of the 20 top-flight clubs, Alan Pardew will have to get cracking the moment his appointment as the new manager is officially announced. Here are some of the issues that need urgent attention. RESTORE DEFENSIVE MEANNESS . Crystal Palace's success in the last couple of seasons has been based on being solid at the back. Under Tony Pulis, they conceded only five goals in nine matches (0.55 goals per game) during the run that secured their Premier League status. This season they conceded 30 goals in 18 games (1.6 per game) with Neil Warnock in charge and their organisation and confidence looked shot before caretaker Keith Millen led them to a clean sheet at QPR on Sunday. Luckily for Palace, Pardew is of the school that being hard to beat is the first priority, and you can build from there. Alan Pardew is set to be confirmed as Crystal Palace's new manager after deciding to leave Newcastle . RIGHT RECRUITMENT . Palace need a consistent goalscorer, their main summer signing Fraizer Campbell has netted only three times so far this season. Bafetimbi Gomis was on Warnock's radar and he would be the type to interest Pardew too – a creator and scorer or goals, and exciting to watch. Whether Swansea would let him go to a Premier League rival in January when Wilfried Bony is away at the African Cup of Nations is debatable but something needs to be done. Palace have also struggled in the full-back positions so expect a couple of acquisitions there. Palace were interested in Swansea's Bafetimbi Gomis (second from left) before Alan Pardew's appointment . UNLOCK THE KEY TO WILFRIED ZAHA AND DWIGHT GAYLE . Pardew was a big fan of Zaha when he was manager of Newcastle but couldn't persuade Mike Ashley to get him on the terms that Manchester United wanted. Zaha has shown glimpses of his talent during his second spell at Selhurst Park but is still not the player who won England recognition towards the end of 2012. Likewise, Gayle is the best natural finisher at the club and one goal in his last eight games is below-par for someone of his talent. Pulis and Warnock didn't trust him as a regular starter but Pardew likes a bit of flamboyance in his forwards and at the age of 24, it is time for Gayle to start delivering. Wilfried Zaha (left), who is on loan from Manchester United, has failed to hit top form this season . GLENN MURRAY AND GETTING BACK TO BASICS . The return of Murray from a loan spell from Reading is symbolic, his goals got Palace into the Premier League and they need that togetherness and spirit within the club again. Likewise, long-serving centre-half Paddy McCarthy may be important, he is currently on loan to Sheffield United. For all the money Pardew may get to spend in January, the diehards at the club – Murray, McCarthy, goalkeeper Julian Speroni, defender Damien Delaney and skipper Mile Jedinak are vital. The never-say-die attitude of the dressing-room is the biggest asset Palace have and Pardew's playing links to the club will help with that. Glenn Murray (right), pictured scoring against Brighton, has returned from a loan spell at Reading . THE RELATIONSHIP WITH CHAIRMAN STEVE PARISH . Parish is on his fifth manager in just over two years, a high churn rate given Palace have been successful on the pitch during that time. Dougie Freedman, Ian Holloway, Tony Pulis and Neil Warnock have come and gone for different reasons, the only common link is Parish appointed and then lost them, suggesting he may be an acquired taste for any manager. He and Pardew have watched games and socialised together in the past and of course Pardew has shown his loyalty to owners before, he never let any frustrations with Mike Ashley at Newcastle spill over into public bad blood. Pardew and his staff have a neat little trick in helping keep the club's chairman and chief executive feel part of things, they send a private email before and after every game, explaining team selection and tactics. It is a sign of respect from Pardew, he shows by doing that he understands he is the manager working for a chairman or owner. It should mean his relationship with Parish is less trained than Pulis's was for example. Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish (left) has paid compensation to secure Pardew's services . GET THE FANS BEHIND THE TEAM . Selhurst Park is one of the most atmospheric grounds in the Premier League, Pulis said where you see chimney pots, you will find real football fans, and there are plenty of chimney pots on the houses in south London. Former player Mark Bright, a close associate of Parish, said the silence of Palace fans during their last home game, a 3-1 home defeat against Southampton, spoke volumes and probably accelerated the need for a managerial change. Anyone who was at Selhurst last season when Palace roared back from 3-0 down against Liverpool to draw 3-3 will know the fans' vocal backing is critical to Palace's survival hopes. Pardew was initially known as Super Al by Palace fans in an ironic way when he played for the club, but his winner against Liverpool in the 1990 FA Cup semi-final – one of the most famous goals in the club's history – made him a genuine hero overnight. Palace's fans are well known for creating a raucous atmosphere at Selhurst Park on matchdays . JONIESTA . Jonathan Williams, 21, is adored by Palace fans and Parish. At Selhurst, he is known as Jonniesta as a nod towards the great Spanish midfielder Andres Iniesta. Wales manager Chris Coleman, a former Palace player himself, has been happy to throw Williams into his team with Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey without suffering a drop in standards, but it hasn't worked out for him at Palace yet, with Pulis and Warnock - who both prefer experienced players - sending him on loan to Ipswich. Williams is due to return in the New Year and once he is over a groin injury, Pardew could be the manager to unlock his talents, he has shown at Newcastle with Perez, Dummett and Aarons, he puts faith in younger players. Tireless in midfield, Williams can pass and move with the best of them.","Alan Pardew is on the verge of being confirmed as Crystal Palace boss .
His job is to take the Eagles out of the relegation zone and to safety .
Pardew must organise Palace's defence and start keeping clean sheets .
He needs to get more out of Wilfried Zaha and Dwight Gayle .

"It is rare for Jeremy Peace, the West Bromwich Albion chairman, to attend the club’s training ground. But when there is serious business to sort, he appears. Business such as finding a fourth permanent head coach in little more than a year. As stand-ins Rob Kelly and Keith Downing put the players through their paces on Tuesday, Peace’s personalised number plate was visible in the car park. He started the day in negotiations with two possible replacements for Alan Irvine, sacked late on Monday night and placed on gardening leave, just as Steve Clarke was 12 months ago. Tony Pulis's representatives are in talks with West Bromwich Albion over the vacant manager's position . Jeremy Peace (right), the West Brom owner, is looking for his fourth head coach in little more than a year . Alan Irvine (above) was sacked as first team coach by West Bromwich Albion on Monday evening . Tony Pulis and Tim Sherwood were the only two candidates spoken to — and on Tuesday night Pulis was on the brink of accepting the job. The plan is for him to be appointed in time for the FA Cup third-round tie against Gateshead on Saturday. Hurdles appear to have been overcome, too. Former Crystal Palace manager Pulis has always made it plain that he would want full control over transfers and the imminent appointment perhaps illustrates that Peace is ready to give a little in his demands. For the past eight years Peace’s preferred, trusted hierarchy sees a head coach taking care of training, with player recruitment left to a technical director — Terry Burton in this situation. Having taken over at Albion in 2002, Peace grew concerned about English football’s traditional managerial model. He did not like the fact a manager would identify talent and insist on certain individuals. Jeremy Peace has been through 12 managers during his time as West Bromwich Albion owner . Pulis working for BT Sport ahead of the Manchester City v Crystal Palace match earlier this month . Former Tottenham Hotspur boss Tim Sherwood is also in contention for the job at West Brom . Nor did he think it was healthy to have a manager bringing an array of staff into a club and then leading a mass exodus when a parting of the ways arrived. Peace embarked on a tour of Europe, eager to see how the likes of Porto, Udinese, Rennes and Bologna operated. ‘The sporting director role was evident in all of the clubs,’ said Peace in a rare interview with Sportsmail last year. They were all looking at England saying, “We cannot understand what’s going on when we deal with England. The clubs there pay top price, they don’t really check what they are buying”.’ Peace reached a watershed with Bryan Robson in charge — unsatisfied with his player recommendations — and decided to implement the continental structure he employs to this day. Burton’s appointment in the summer looked to have strengthened Peace’s resolve over the arrangement. Defender Joleon Lescott looks dejected after West Brom conceded the second goal to Stoke on Sunday . Forward Mame Biram Diouf scores the opening goal of Stoke City's win against West Bromwich Albion . The former Wimbledon manager, who arrived from heading Arsenal’s development teams, works alongside sporting director Richard Garlick. Essentially, Burton seeks out the talent — with the aid of West Brom’s scouting network — and Garlick gets deals over the line, concentrating on finances. The role had been a single one occupied by Dan Ashworth before he left for the FA in September 2012. In this structure, Irvine was solely responsible for training the players and picking the team. Pulis, however, will want to enter The Hawthorns as the principal man and instructed his advisers to make that point to Pearce. He walked away from Crystal Palace on the eve of the season because he was frustrated that transfer targets he identified had not materialised. Informed observers expressed shock at any softening of Peace’s methods. But maybe, driven to keep West Brom among the riches of the Premier League, he has opened up to compromise. Technical director Terry Burton (left) at Irvine's unveiling was brought in from Arsenal last summer . Club record signing Brown Ideye (centre) has been a major disappointment since joining in the summer . The 58-year-old’s worst nightmare would be relegation to the Sky Bet Championship. He has built the club into a sustainable business by running such a tight ship that gym equipment is rented rather than bought because fashions can change. West Brom turned a £6million profit in the latest financial accounts. Even with players having to take a 50 per cent cut in wages in the event of relegation, Peace would find such a prospect unpalatable. Sherwood, the former Tottenham manager, was an option, and he was approached about taking over when Pepe Mel. Irvine acknowledges the crowd at his home debut back in August at the start of the season . On that occasion the wages Sherwood wanted for his right-hand man proved the stumbling block to his appointment. Pulis has won that battle, too. The 56-year-old will be joined by long-serving assistant David Kemp, who is based in Florida. Irvine was a popular figure and his training methods were liked. But, as one well-placed source put it, ‘he was just a head coach’. There is an inevitable problem that players, perhaps subconsciously, will not treat the coach charged with inspiring results the same as they would a manager. Despite all his battles won with previous incumbents, it is something Peace appears to be willing to shift on to land Pulis. Former Tottenham manager Tim Sherwood is the favourite to replace Irvine at the Hawthorns .

"Crystal Palace have made an opening offer of around £6million for Swansea striker Bafetimbi Gomis. The move comes after Swansea agreed a loan deal for Benfica striker Nelson Oliveira. However, Swansea want Oliveira as cover for Wilfried Bony who is joining up with Ivory Coast for the Africa Cup of Nations next month. They only signed Gomis on a free transfer in the summer and are in no rush to sell. Crystal Palace have made a £6million offer for Swansea striker Bafetimbi Gomis . Gomis scored a header for Swansea against Arsenal at the Liberty Stadium in November . France international Gomis is understood to have a release clause figure of £7million in his contract but that does not kick in until the summer. Palace manager Neil Warnock wants a striker and a left-back as priorities for his squad with an offer on the table for Lille's Senegal international Pape Souare. Gomis has interest from other Premier League sides but Palace are the first to make an offer. Manager Garry Monk said: 'The links and speculation I can't stop, but Bafe's [Gomis] a Swansea City player.' Gomis, 29, joined Swansea for free on a four-year deal in June 2014. Monk says Gomis is a different type of striker to Oliveira and the signing will give him more attacking options. Gomis joined Swansea on a free transfer in the summer, but could be on his way to south London . Swansea agreed a deal to bring in Nelson Oliveira on loan from Benfica . 'I've really enjoyed working with Bafe [Gomis],' said Monk. 'He's a great professional, a good guy and a top, top, player. 'Obviously trying to give him game time has been difficult this season with Wilfried Bony doing so well in that lone striker role. 'It can be frustrating for players, but Bafe's been brilliant. He's not shown that at all in training and he's worked extremely hard. 'I'll be looking to play Bafe very much in this coming period and for him to be wearing that shirt, then it's his to lose.'","Crystal Palace have made a £6m offer for Bafetimbi Gomis .

"The latest milk crazes have been those such as coconut or maybe even almond milk, but one other new alternative is taking the country by storm and offering significant health benefits, although you will have to fork out a little bit more. Camel milk is the oldest milk that human beings have been utilising across the globe but here in Australia it's a relatively whole new idea. A Queensland dairy has just received Safe Food accreditation to sell pasteurised camel milk, referred to as 'white gold' to the public from their farm on the Sunshine coast, one of just two in Australia, the other being in Western Australia. Scroll down for video . A Queensland dairy on the Sunshine coast has just received Safe Food accreditation to sell pasteurised camel milk . Camel milk is the oldest milk that human beings have been utilising across the globe but here in Australia it's a relatively whole new idea . Q Camel director Lauren Brisbane says they have purchased a number of years in past years and have been putting together the dairy this year, to establish a quality business. 'We just currently got a processor to process the milk,' she said. 'I've been selling milk for about eight years but I took the science approach (for camel milk) because we enjoy doing it and it offers great benefits to the public.' Camel milk is : . *Higher in vitamin C (x5 of cow milk) *Higher in iron (x10) potassium, magnesium . *Higher in calcium . *Higher ratio of omega 3 to omega 6 . *Contains no beta-lactoglobulin (allergy senstive - lower in lactose) *Lower cholestrol . Ms Brisbane embarked on a two year research project to look at selling camel milk in Australia and started studying it's many benefits and why it's so healthy. 'There's been enormous amounts of research on it, 40 years worth. 6,000 years they've (camels) been domesticated and it's been ignored here because it's primarily in North Africa and the Middle East,' she said. The difficulty in milking camels in Australia is that they're not used to it, the animals have been predominantly wild for the last 100 years. 'Training camels to milk is no mean feat, you have to train them because there's no history of milking and they have to trust you.' Camels have been domesticated for 6,000 years primarily in North Africa and the Middle East . Camel milk has significant health benefits for children with autism, those with diabetes and intestinal problems, as well as allergies . 'Not every camel are suitable for milking, it depends on the animal and personality, some animals can be difficult.' Ms Brisbane says there is a lot of hard work involved in milking camels because you have to make sure they are looked after or they won't produce. 'You've got to spend time looking after the babies as well as the mothers.' All those factors, including training for staff and even for vets into the new industry, contribute to extremely high production costs which will see those buying it, have to fork out $25, just for a litre. And you won't get much milk out of each camel per day, with the average at about 5 Litres or 10 if you're lucky. 'That price is common around the world,' said Ms Brisbane, 'even Dubai where the labor is cheaper, they can't produce it for under $15 a litre.' 'In the states it goes fro anywhere up to $40 a litre.' Chair of the Australian Camel Industry Association, Ms Brisbane says while these animals have been regarded as feral pests in Australia, they are really quite useful to farming operations. 'Wise farmers use them and co graze them with cattle, wonderful to increase cattle wage, help manage land, they eat weeds.' And while one wouldn't think the demand for camel milk is very high, in fact there's a waiting list for this special type of milk because it's been proven scientifically to have numerous benefits for a number of conditions. 'There's proven scientific evidence that it can be utilised for children with autism, there's absolutely dramatic results,' she said. Camel milk has also been proven to have significant changes in controlling diabetes and for intestinal problems. 'There's no comparison to normal milk.' The Australian Camel Industry Association states that camel milk is capable of healing and it has been proven by nomadic cultures in the Middle East and Africa who use camel milk exclusively . Camel milk is higher in Vitamin C than cows milk, it's also higher in calcium, lower in lactose and cholestrol . The Australian Camel Industry Association states that camel milk is capable of healing and it has been proven by nomadic cultures in the Middle East and Africa who use camel milk exclusively. It is said to also heal food allergies as well as seasonal allergies because the antibodies that camel milk contains are highly anti viral and anti bacterial. The association says it's been found to heal ADD and ADHD or other learning challenges that can often be directly related back to gut issues. But one of the most important things of all when producing a new product for people to consume is undoubtedly the taste and apparently there's not a lot of difference to your usual cow milk, just a little bit saltier. '(comes down to)What we feed our animals, healthy animals produce a better product, desert animals more watery milk, our milk is creamy , pure pure white, low in fat, no heavy feeling when you drink it, much easier to digest, more compatible with the digestive system,' said Ms Brisbane. 'I think it will become popular with people who are health conscious, just half a cup to a cup a day is all you need and it really makes a difference.' While Q Camel has only just over 30 camels on its dairy farm now, those numbers are growing with a lot of their animals now pregnant. The dairy are trying to build up their herd because they don't start milking the mothers until a baby is two months old. A walking encyclopaedia when it comes to the camel industry, Ms Brisbane says she loves the industry because camels are such a lovely animal. 'We have names for all our camels, every one looks different, and I can tell them all apart.' As for whether she has a favourite! 'Of course (hahahaha) a couple melt your heart, they're good to walk up to, very gentle, beautiful, highly intelligent, working with them is the easiest.'","Queensland dairy received safe food accreditation to sell pasteurised camel milk .

"The rolling countryside of Dorset beloved by poet and novelist Thomas Hardy will be 'devastated' if plans to build a dozen wind turbines there go ahead, angry residents have claimed. The Thomas Hardy Society has condemned proposals to erect two wind farms close to locations the author wrote into his best-known works, saying they will blight the beautiful countryside that attracts crowds of tourists each year. The proposed sites for the 400ft turbines are between the villages of Tolpuddle and Puddletown, close to where both The Return Of The Native and Far From The Madding Crowd were set, and at Charminster, not far from the tiny village of Stinsford where Hardy was born and where his heart is buried. Residents in the west Dorset countryside celebrated by Thomas Hardy are fighting plans for two wind farms . Developers want to build five turbines between Puddletown and Tolpuddle, referred to by Hardy as Tolchurch, and a further seven in the village of Charminster, near Wolfeton House, a key setting in Hardy's short story The Lady Penelope. Charminster is also down the road from Dorchester, where Hardy set The Mayor Of Casterbridge. Thomas Hardy set his novels and poems in the Wessex countryside where two wind farms are planned . The Tolpuddle/Puddletown site is flanked by Waterston Manor, the inspiration for fictional Weatherbury Farm in Far from the Madding Crowd. A star-studded film adaptation of one of Hardy's most celebrated works is currently being shot and is due out next year. Fans of the Victorian author fear the turbines will blight the heart of Hardy's Wessex and put tourists off visiting the landscape so intimately described by him. Katherine Butler, owner of Waterston Manor, said: 'In Far From the Madding Crowd, Gabriel Oak walks across the countryside from Dorchester to Blandford right through the proposed sites. 'He would have had quite a shock if he had to walk past two wind farms. 'In fact, Hardy would probably be able to see these wind turbines from his final resting place at Stinsford.' Tony Fincham, chairman of the Thomas . Hardy Society, said: 'The sites are simply awful places to put these . wind turbines. The locations are very much in the heart of Hardy . Country. Up to seven wind turbines are proposed for this site at Charminster, just outside Dorchester where Hardy worked . This map shows the Charminster site, where up to seven turbines are planned, and the Toldpuddle farm site . Wild countryside: This picture shows the land chosen for a proposed wind farm near Tolpuddle in west Dorset . 'It is a relatively unspoiled area of downland and the last place something like a wind farm should go. 'A lot of tourism in Dorset is thanks to Hardy, and if you destroy these landscapes there will be nothing left for people to see. 'People visit west Dorset because of the relatively unspoilt countryside and the fact that Hardy described it so intimately in his fiction and poetry. 'To just go and stick up these turbines at these location would be terrible.' The plot of land for the Tolpuddle/Puddletown wind farm lies near Waterston Manor and is the setting of one of Hardy's best known short stories, The Three Strangers. Angry: Opponents gather at the Tolpuddle wind farm site, near landscape immortalised by Thomas Hardy . 'Devastating': Katherine Thimbleby lives at Wolfeton House, which featured in Hardy's 1882 short story Lady Penelope . The turbines will be visible from much of Egdon Heath, which featured in the author's 1878 novel The Return of the Native. Nigel Thimbleby lives at Wolfeton House, a Tudor manor house at Charminster which was home to the Drenghards in Hardy's 1889 short story Lady Penelope. He said: 'These proposals are completely misplaced.  To put them here would completely spoil Hardy's beautiful countryside. 'Not only would it drive down the price of houses round here, but it would also have a huge effect on Dorset's number one industry - tourism. 'These turbines could be devastatingly damaging.' The two wind farms are being planned by two separate energy firms, West Coast Energy, which is behind the Tolpuddle/Puddletown site, and Broadview Energy, which has drawn up the Charminster proposal. The Charminster site is close to Dorchester, setting of Hardy's The Mayor Of Casterbridge - this still is from the television adaption starring Ciaran Hinds as Michael Henchard and Jodhi May as Elizabeth Jane . Julie Christie, pictured, starred in the 1967 film of Hardy's Far From The Madding Crowd, set in Wessex . Tom Cosgrove, of Broadview Energy, said: 'It is inevitable that any wind farm will introduce change into an area. 'Certainly Thomas Hardy is an important figure in the history of our country but that does not necessarily mean you can't integrate new elements into the landscape. 'It is all about managing change in the right way.  It is widely known that we need new ways of generating electricity in this country, and onshore wind power is a fast, cheap way of doing that.' West Coast Energy previously submitted plans for nine turbines to the local council but withdrew them last week while they went back to the drawing board following protests. Steve Salt, from West Coast Energy, said: 'Following a review of the various statutory and other consultee responses and after discussions with West Dorset District Council, we have decided to withdraw the planning application. 'This will enable consideration to be given to the concerns raised and to thesubmission of a new revised scheme for the site.'","Five turbines proposed for Tolpuddle in Dorset and a maximum of seven for Charminster .

"Raheem Sterling has escaped retrospective punishment for his apparent slap on Swansea City's Federico Fernandez on Monday night. The Liverpool forward appeared to swing his arm towards the face of the Swansea defender during the Reds' 4-1 Premier League triumph against their Welsh opponents. No action was taken by the officials at the time, and the Football Association have also decided that no retrospective punishment will be handed out to the 20-year-old. Liverpool's Raheem Sterling (right) swung an arm towards the face of Federico Fernandez (left) on Monday . The incident came during the closing stages of Liverpool's 4-1 Premier League win against Swansea . Sterling was described as 'lucky' by Sky Sports pundits Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher, after the Liverpool star was seen appearing to swing an arm towards the face of Fernandez. After shielding the ball out for a goal kick from Sterling, Fernandez was bumped into the Kop by the 20-year-old - much to the annoyance of the Argentine. The pair, who had been battling against each other throughout the game, confronted one another before Sterling was seen to aim a swing at Fernandez right in front of the linesman. Sterling's indescrestion went unpunished by referee Andre Marriner and the makeshift forward was subseqeuntly replaced by boss Brendan Rodgers - with Mario Balotelli his replacement on 82 minutes. It started after Sterling (right) barged Fernandez into the Kop stand during a tussle for the ball . Sterling's (right) nudge irked Fernandez (left) who put his hand around the back of his neck . The pair had to be separated by the linesman (centre) as they continue to exchange words . Sterling (right) was subsequently replaced by Liverpool for Mario Balotelli after the incident . Speaking post-match on Sky Sports' Monday Night Football show Neville said: 'He's [Sterling] a lucky boy. Cisse's been charged retrospectively today. 'I think the referee and the linesman have both seen this and Howard Webb said a few weeks ago that this is a sending off. Cisse will get a three-game ban for violent conduct but how are the referee and linesman going to give credibility where both can say they haven't seen these two incidents. 'It cannot happen where they say they haven't seen it so I think Sterling will get away with it because the referee can't put it in his report that he hasn't seen it. How he, the linesman, tomorrow, can write in his report that he didn't see it will mean that I think he will lose credibility, I really do.' The mideamonour was the only blemish to an impressive performance by Sterling playing as the Reds' furthest forward. Carragher added: 'I think he [Sterling] was lucky. Fernandez was tight and aggressive and earlier on in the night Sterling was frustrated with his tackling. 'He gives a push then Fernandez gives Sterling a clip with the left hand before Sterling throws his hand, it's not a punch, but we've seen people sent off for things like this.' Victory for Liverpool moved them up to eighth in the table on 28 points after 19 games ahead of their clash against Leicester City on New Year's Day.

"Andy Murray is likely to have to accept a considerable cut in payments when his new clothing deal is unveiled as his lucrative five-year deal with adidas comes to an end. Murray is shortly expected to announce a new major sponsor, joining Laura Robson and James Ward on the clothing-go-round as British players’ on-court appearance change considerably in 2015. Robson has also left adidas and gone to their fellow giants Nike, while Murray is expected to replace his expiring five year $15 million deal with an arrangement promoting a company less automatically associated with tennis. Andy Murray wears an adidas t-shirt during a training session ahead of the Australian Open earlier this year . It is believed that a frontrunner in negotiations has been American company Under Armour, who are more known in this country for their deal kitting out Tottenham Hotspur. At present their tennis involvement has been limited, although they currently kit out rising American star Sloane Stephens and the veteran US journeyman Robby Ginepri. It could be that they see Murray as a good fit for their slightly edgier, sport-specific image. Industry experts say that New Balance have also been interested in expanding their tennis presence, although last year they signed Canada’s Milos Raonic. Rumours that Murray might revert to his old clothing partner, Fred Perry, are reckoned to be inaccurate. Regardless, the money is not likely to approach the $3 million per year that adidas have been paying the 27 year-old Scot over a period that took in his Wimbledon, US Open and Olympics triumphs. Murray shows his frustrations on court as he suffers defeat to Roger Federer at The O2 last month . The reduced upfront payment, perhaps barely half the previous sum according to industry observers, is partly due to him failing to reproduce that form in the year that saw him return from back surgery. It is also recognition that he is heading into his late twenties and that adidas replica kit sales have not been as high as hoped in what is said to be a relatively depressed market overall at present. The new deal will have to take into account that he is likely to continue wearing adidas tennis shoes, as this has been his favoured footwear since he was a teenager. Murray’s representatives did not wish to comment, although they confirmed that an announcement is expected in the next few weeks. His departure from adidas will top a year of change that saw Ivan Lendl, assistant coach Dani Vallverdu and fitness trainer Jez Green depart his team and Amelie Mauresmo installed at its head. Murray used to wear the clothing of Fred Perry but is unlikely to return to his old sponsor . Whenever she reappears Robson will be wearing the swoosh instead of the three stripes. She is currently training in Florida and her return from long-term wrist problems is increasingly likely to be in the United States rather than at the Australian Open. Emerging British No 2 Ward, who has risen to the cusp of the top 100, is expected to appear next year kitted out on court by Ted Baker. Until now the well-known British brand, whose founder Ray Kelvin is a long-established tennis nut, has restricted itself to providing suits for players and British teams when out and about at official functions but they are now looking for deeper involvement. Laura Robson has left adidas to join their major clothing rivals Nike ahead of her return to the court .

"Home captain Steve Smith's career-best 192 was the highlight of day two between Australia and India in Melbourne, but the tourists will be pleased with how they dug in when their time came to bat. Having witnessed the Baggy Green run up 530 from their overnight 295 for five, India - 2-0 down in the series - may have been expected to be worse off than they were at the close. They ended the day at the MCG on 108 for one, thanks to Murali Vijay's unbeaten 50, and although work remains to be done, they can take heart from their defiance. Steve Smith acknowledges the crowd after being dismissed on 192 runs against India in Melbourne . Smith was eight runs short of a double century as Australia took control on the second day of the third Test . Their resolve will have been severely tested by Smith and the Australian lower-order, though. Smith, shining as captain in place of the injured Michael Clarke, recorded his third straight hundred after resuming on 72, and had Brad Haddin with him for company, with the veteran keeper making 55. Smith's seventh test hundred came in 191 balls but he was not to stop there, even when Haddin left him as the only remaining recognised batsman, bottom-edging Mohammed Shami behind. That brought Mitchell Johnson to the middle and he put up an entertaining 28, going after 37 balls when R Ashwin tempted him down the pitch and he was stumped by MS Dhoni. Smith raises his bat to celebrate reaching his century during the third Test against India . Mitchell Johnson managed 28 off 37 balls before being stumped by India's MS Dhoni . Ryan Harris was next in and the gnarled paceman offered some genuine surprise, going to a Test best 74 from 88 balls. Harris clubbed eight fours and a six while out in the middle, providing real frustration for the visiting attack who, at that stage, would have been hoping to keep Australia to around 450. Ashwin eventually did for Harris, getting him playing across the line, and when Nathan Lyon went to Shami for 11 all that remained was the question of whether Smith would get to a double hundred. Murali Vijay (left) connects with a shot on his way to an unbeaten 50 on day two of the third Test . The answer was no, the skipper cleaned up by Umesh Yadav before heading off to a standing ovation after his 305-ball vigil. He quickly had to switch to tactical mode as India started their reply, and it was he who pouched the only wicket of the innings, scooping up Shikhar Dhawan for 28 off Harris. After that Vijay (55no) and Cheteshwar Pujara (25no) got to the close, although the latter was fortunate to see Haddin put him down - albeit off a difficult chance off Josh Hazlewood- when on 12.","Steve Smith scored 192 before being bowled by Umesh Yadav .

"Goodwood officials believe their summer Festival meeting will be elevated to the global racing stage after unveiling the biggest sponsorship deal in the history of British horseracing. The 10-year agreement with the Qatar Racing and Equestrian club, which also backs Longchamp’s Prix de L’Arc de Triomphe meeting, will see prizemoney for the 2015 five-day fixture rise to £4.5million with an injection of £2m into eight key races. The feature Group One Sussex Stakes, won last season by Kingman and in 2011 and 2012 by the mighty Frankel, will be worth an extra £700,000 making the Group One mile contest only the sixth £1m race in the British calendar. James Doyle rides Kingman to victory at the Sussex Stakes at Glorious Goodwood . The Group One Nassau Stakes has been raised to £600,000 while each feature Group Two race - the Lennox Stakes, Goodwood Cup and King George Stakes – will be worth £300,000. The historic Stewards’ Cup, whose name was controversially dropped last season when backed by bookmaker 32Red – a move described as a ‘mistake’ by course owner Lord March – will be restored and worth £250,000. While some traditionalists may blanch at the fact the meeting is to be officially called the Qatar Goodwood Festival, managing director Adam Waterworth conceded that the meeting, which starts on July 28, will still be referred to as Glorious Goodwood, an unofficial title, by the vast majority. Goodwood's 10-year agreement with Qatar Racing will see a prize money injection of £2m into eight key races . The deal reflects the growing reliance of British racing on Qatari money with another organisation from that county, Qipco, backing the British Champions Series and Champions day at Ascot in October. Waterworth, who hopes to attract more overseas entries, said: ‘I have always felt that the Festival week at the end of July on the Sussex Downs is one of the most special weeks of the year. ‘What this partnership does do is elevate the meeting, especially to those outside racing. The prize money levels really do stand comparison with any now.’ Meanwhile, champion jump jockey AP McCoy will present the trophy to the William Hill PDC World Darts champion when he is crowned at Alexandra Palace on January 4.","The deal will see an injection of £2million into eight key races .

"Sportsmail analyses what we learned from the latest round of fixtures in the Premier League and Football League during the festive period: . 1. While virtually every other manager moaned about the Christmas fixture list, Burnley proved it is possible to play two games in 48 hours and not get too tired. Winger George Boyd had covered more ground than any other Premier League player on Boxing Day when he ran 8.1 miles against Liverpool, and he matched that distance exactly at Manchester City with his energy late in the game a key factor in the comeback from 2-0 down. But Sean Dyche’s whole team followed those energy levels. An unchanged side ran 74.5 miles collectively at the Etihad Stadium, further than the 74.2 they achieved in the 1-0 defeat by Liverpool. George Boyd (left) ran 8.1 miles twice in two days as Sean Dyche's (right) side drew with Manchester City . 2. Santi Cazorla has emerged as Arsenal’s penalty expert after slotting away his third spot kick in five matches. At the age of 30 the Spain midfielder seems to have come to spot-kick duties late in his career. Until he got the first of this batch – at Stoke – he had never previously scored from the spot for the Gunners in more than two seasons. There are no penalties listed among his goals in Spain for Villarreal and Malaga, either. Santi Cazorla capped an impressive performance for Arsenal against West Ham by scoring a penalty . 3. Wilfried Zaha’s return to Crystal Palace was said to be one of the reasons Tony Pulis fell out with chairman Steve Parish before walking out before the start of the season. Parish, who wanted Zaha back from Manchester United, got his way by bringing in the 22-year-old on loan after Pulis had left. It hasn’t been a success. Zaha scored on his second debut, but since then has only twice completed 90 minutes. He was restored to the starting line-up by caretaker Keith Millen for the 0-0 draw at QPR, but was subbed again after little more than an hour having had only one shot at goal. Queens Park Rangers defender Richard Dunne (left) holds off Wilfried Zaha (right) of Crystal Palace . 4. Cesc Fabregas continues to set the standard for creative midfield play. His delicious pass off the outside of his foot for Eden Hazard to score Chelsea’s goal at Southampton was his 13th assist of the season. That’s the same number that Steven Gerrard achieved all last season for Liverpool to be the best provider of the 2013-14 campaign. Cesc Fabregas has already provided 13 assists for his Chelsea team-mates so far this season . 5. Mystery continues to surround the games that top referee Mark Clattenburg is given to control. The 39-year-old FIFA official, recently banned as a punishment for driving away from a game at West Brom in his own car because he wanted to dash to see a pop concert, was back at The Hawthorns again for the Boxing Day game with Manchester City. But on Sunday he was demoted to League Two to take charge of Shrewsbury’s 0-0 draw with Wycombe. Meanwhile Neil Swarbrick, Martin Atkinson, Mike Jones, Roger East and Anthony Taylor all took charge of two Premier League games in 48 hours. Mark Clattenburg refereed City's win at West Brom on Boxing Day, before dropping to League Two on Sunday . 6. Former Barcelona star Bojan has hit all the headlines but it is Steven Nzonzi who is the unsung hero of Stoke’s midfield. The 26-year-old Frenchman was his side’s top passer in the 2-0 win over West Brom as well as the Boxing Day victory at Everton. Nzonzi and skipper Ryan Shawcross are the only two players to have been picked by boss Mark Hughes for every minute of every Premier League game. Steven Nzonzi (centre) has been the unsung hero so far for Stoke City in the Premier League this season . 7. Newcastle will send Cheick Tiote to the Africa Cup of Nations in January with fingers crossed that he comes back without any further injury troubles. The Ivory Coast midfielder has finally shaken off the hamstring issues which have affected him all season and was a key man in the 3-2 win over Everton. The 28-year-old made one goal, was involved in the build-up to another and set up three more chances. Newcastle's Cheick Tiote (right) has recovered from hamstring issues but is off to the African Cup of Nations . 8. Andros Townsend has struggled for first team chances under Mauricio Pochettino – the 0-0 draw with Manchester United was only his second Premier League start all season. The England winger did his best to grab the chance, covering 395 metres at sprinting speed, despite getting taken off 11 minutes from the end the most of any player on display at White Hart Lane. Sadly there wasn’t enough end product to it. He managed two long range shots which were easily saved, but failed to set up a chance for any of his team mates. Andros Townsend (right) managed two shots for Tottenham before being substituted after 79 minutes . 9. Gary Rowett has transformed Birmingham since taking charge at the end of October following the humiliation of an 8-0 home defeat by Bournemouth. The 3-1 win at Nottingham Forest took the former Burton boss to 20 points from his first ten matches. Welsh striker David Cotterill has benefited more than most from the added confidence – he’s got four goals in the last six games. David Cotterill (left) has flourished under the guidance of new Birmingham manager Gary Rowett . 10. For all that players and managers argue about the merits of a winter break, fans love the Christmas programme. An average of 36,000 went to Premier League games over Boxing Day and Sunday, while the figure was more than 20,000 in the Championship, above 7,000 in League One, and 5,600 in League Two.","Burnley's starting line-up was unchanged for the game at Manchester City .

"Steve Bruce claims players diving threatens the honesty of the Premier League that makes it admired across the world. The Hull manager said he was not convinced by calls to introduce a panel to review diving incidents, as has been suggested by Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger, but said action does need to be taken. Chelsea have been at the centre of renewed controversy over diving this week and, during their match against Hull on December 13, Diego Costa and Willian were both booked for supposedly taking a tumble, while Bruce compared a Gary Cahill dive to 'something out of Swan Lake'.

Eden Hazard is felled by Laurent Koscielny against Arsenal - a penalty was given and scored by the Belgian . Bruce likened Gary Cahill's dive against Hull to 'something out of Swan Lake' - no penalty was awarded . Bruce said: 'It's very difficult for referees when you have people like [Eden] Hazard and Willian, who are genuinely quick and take you on with a low centre of gravity - the slightest tap can take them over. 'But when you see a blatant dive, I think you have to take action. The reason why the Barclays Premier League is the league that it is, is for its honesty, its integrity and ferocity. 'You must remember that people enjoy the honesty of the Premier League all over the world. We can't make it like every other league - it's a different culture.

"On the field at least, this crushing Hibs victory represented a new low for Rangers and proof that the problems besetting this football team run a lot deeper than the identity of the manager. Any hope that the placing of Ally McCoist on gardening leave might provoke a positive reaction was dissolved within 12 barnstorming minutes as Hibs grabbed control of the contest and rendered it an early walkover with strikes from David Gray and Jason Cummings. This was Rangers’ heaviest domestic defeat since losing 6-2 in an Old Firm derby in 2000, a day on which a certain Alan Stubbs helped man the Celtic defence. Stubbs the manager spoke afterwards of Hibs’ near-perfect performance and, in Scott Allan, he possessed the game’s classiest performer. Hibernian's David Gray strikes the ball to put the home side 1-0 up against Rangers early on in the match . Players watch on as Gray's shot flies into the top left-hand corner of the net after just eight minutes . Hibernian: Oxley, Gray (Booth 74), Hanlon, Fontaine, Stevenson, Allan, Robertson, Craig, Handling (Kennedy 87), Cummings (Stanton 87), Malonga .

Booked: Black 21, McCulloch 86 . Kenny McDowall acted as assistant throughout McCoist’s time in charge, but this was not so much a bruising introduction to the front line as a full-on torture session. The caretaker manager looked shell-shocked as Rangers were taken apart by a side which started the day seven points poorer off in the Championship standings. The irony is that nobody gained from this result so much as the league leaders, and Hearts’ procession to automatic promotion moved a step closer as Rangers fell further behind in the title race. Even victory in next weekend’s Edinburgh derby is highly unlikely to provide Stubbs’ side with the opening to haul themselves back into the hunt but, having now chalked up three victories on the bounce, there is momentum at Easter Road. And, having now beaten Rangers twice in the league handsomely, there is no reason for them to fear a play-off against the Glasgow club at the end of the season. Easter Road has arguably proved Hibs’ biggest obstacle to keeping pace with neighbours Hearts at the top of the table. Still resentful of being relegated alongside the neighbours last term, the Leith crowd have been a cranky lot this season, affording little patience to Stubbs’ new-look side as they have bedded in. Jason Cummings was in the right place at the right time to slot home Hibs' second of the afternoon . Cummings celebrates with his team-mates after putting Hibs 2-0 up against Rangers at Easter Road . With Hibs entertaining Rangers for the first time since the latter’s financial meltdown in 2012, this was a top-tier standard occasion and the audience reflected the fact by backing their players to the hilt. The ground was not full but it was noisy and Gray’s rocket soon boosted the decibel levels. Although Rangers had not been here on league duty since a Nikica Jelavic double gave them a comfortable win in December 2011, they had visited the stadium for last term’s Challenge Cup Final, which ended in a humiliating defeat by Raith Rovers. This was a different class of opposition but the shame was no less for it. The Hibs fans had already been warmed up by the sight of former Hearts midfielder Ian Black being bullied off the ball by Allan when Gray unleashed his piledriver. A Liam Craig cross had been half-cleared by Lee McCulloch and Gray had time to take a touch as he stepped on to it 20 yards out. The resulting shot was straight and true, arrowing high past Steve Simonsen at a fair pelt. Rangers' Ian Black (centre) looks very disappointed as he is substituted after just 34 minutes of the game . Nicky Law (second left) challenges Hibs' Scott Robertson, scorer of the home side's third goal . If that goal could just about be forgiven, Rangers’ defence was utterly incompetent at the second. Not only did Craig have the time and space to meet Dominique Malonga’s looping cross unopposed, his ball back across goal found Cummings in even more room in the six-yard box where he applied the simplest of finishes. Cummings scored twice at Ibrox earlier in the season and he was again proving a constant menace, pulling Rangers’ defenders all over the place and showing no lack of confidence with the ball at his feet. He attempted one of his zingers from 20 yards, forcing Simonsen to spill and, after Scott Robertson sent the rebound wide, Black’s embarrassment was completed as the No 8 was shown on the board to signal his withdrawal. Already on a booking after a brainless challenge on Allan, the midfielder was saved from himself, if not the baying crowd, by McDowall, with Kyle Hutton being sent on in his place. There were just 33 minutes on the clock. Paul Hanlon (right) makes a challenge on Rangers' Nicky Clark during the Scottish Championship match . Rangers' Steven Smith (centre) tries to break past the challenge of Hibs' Robertson (left) A cry of ‘sack the board’ went up from the away end and there was even some rare self-deprecation as they started to sarcastically cheer a succession of passes from the men in blue. The break robbed Hibs of some momentum but they stood firm defensively with Liam Fontaine and Gray both putting their heads in the way of Nicky Law shots. Kris Boyd had come on for Rangers at the break but the burly striker never looked like threatening. Instead, Hibs were able to pick their guests off. Robertson got the third, swapping passes with Allan before sliding a low finish across Simonsen, and then Craig helped himself to the fourth. It was again Allan with the assist, first bamboozling Hutton with a shimmy before driving forward and then scooping a pass into the path of Craig who, from a similar angle to Robertson, applied a subtle volleyed finish into the far corner.","Before the game, Rangers were second in the Scottish Championship, seven points clear of third-place Hibernian .

"Nigel Pearson has taken a maverick approach to watching Leicester games, sitting in the stands and relaying instructions to his support staff while his peers prowl the touchline. But he admits he may be forced to take cover in the dugout when he returns to his old club Hull City. ‘I don’t know where I’d be accommodated if I decide to sit in the stands,’ he said, ‘Perhaps I’ll sit among the Hull fans although I might get a bad reception.’ Manager Nigel Pearson points the way as Leicester City train last week . They have plenty of ammunition to throw at Pearson, who chose to leave and return to Leicester in 2011. His current side are 13 games without victory and five points adrift at the bottom of the table. But Pearson claimed he would not treat Sunday’s game with Hull as though it determines his future employment. ‘I don’t ever feel I have to win otherwise (I get sacked),’ said Pearson. ‘If I thought like that I couldn’t sell what I say to the players in the dressing room. But ultimately, we have to start turning it around.’ Pearson shares a joke with West Ham manager Sam Allardyce before their clash earlier this month . Steve Bruce, meanwhile, insists Hull must accept they will be involved in this season’s relegation scrap, despite climbing out of the drop zone with their first win in 11 at Sunderland on Boxing Day. Victory against Leicester at the KC Stadium on Sunday would increase the gap between his team and the league’s bottom club to nine points. And Bruce said: ‘It’s a bigger game for me than the Cup final. Yes, I know that’s quite a statement, but that’s what it means to me. Leicester striker Leonardo Ulloa celebrates scoring against Tottenham in a game they would go on to lose . ‘If we turn them over to go nine points clear of them at the halfway stage, it’s a big turnaround to be caught.’ He added: ‘We’ve only been in the division a total of four years in our history so we’re going to be in and around it at the bottom. We always expected to be. ‘The league is starting to take shape at halfway. I could have called the bottom eight — and we have to accept we are going to be one of them.’","Leicester are bottom of the Premier League without a win in 13 games .

"Kenny McDowall has apologised to the Rangers support after commencing his tenure as caretaker manager with a humiliating 4-0 defeat by Hibs at Easter Road. With Ally McCoist placed on gardening leave after tendering his resignation, McDowall prepared the players for Saturday’s Championship match but there was no improvement in performance as the team lost its fourth away fixture in succession. Hibernian's David Gray strikes the ball to put the home side 1-0 up against Rangers early on in the match . Players watch on as Gray's shot flies into the top left-hand corner of the net after just eight minutes . Early goals from David Gray and Jason Cummings saw Hibs sprint into a two-goal lead within 12 minutes, before Scott Robertson and Liam Craig extended the margin of victory in the second half as Rangers were comprehensively outplayed. ‘Going two down after 12 minutes is not an ideal start,’ said McDowall. ‘All the work we had done on the training ground during the week went up in the air. ‘I would like to apologise to the support. I am very disappointed with the performance. I don’t have any excuses for you — Hibs were the better team and deserved to win the game.’ The drubbing leaves Rangers 15 points adrift of league leaders Hearts, who moved further clear in their bid to claim the one automatic promotion spot thanks to a 1-0 win at Livingston. Jason Cummings was in the right place at the right time to slot home Hibs' second of the afternoon . Cummings celebrates with his team-mates after putting Hibs 2-0 up against Rangers at Easter Road . Rangers’ best hope of making it to the Premiership would appear to be via the play-offs, where Hibs are likely opponents. ‘We’ve just got to keep trying to win games and see where it takes us,’ continued McDowall. ‘If it’s a play-off, we’re prepared to go there.’ McDowall admitted he had substituted midfielder Ian Black after just 33 minutes as the former Hearts midfielder was already on a booking and looking liable to be sent off. He admitted his players’ organisation had been poor and also conceded that the performance was the worst produced since Walter Smith took him to Ibrox in 2007.

They let themselves down in terms of where they should have been on the park. ‘Commitment? You should ask them maybe.’ McDowall, who has been installed until the end of the season, admits the turbulence created by McCoist’s exit, combined with the ongoing off-field uncertainty, was taking its toll on the players. ’I couldn’t deny that the goings-on have not helped the situation,’ he added. ‘Do I want to make that an excuse? No. We are professional people, the lot of us. I will take responsibility — I set the team up. I’m sure he boys will take responsibility for their performances, too. ‘It wasn’t good enough on the day, Hibs were the better team.

"Ronny Deila has pledged to find a fix for John Guidetti’s confidence crisis after the Swede was the chief striking sinner in a shock Celtic stalemate with Ross County. The on-loan Manchester City man’s grim form in front of goal continued with another blank and a bad second-half miss in 0-0 draw. That’s five games without netting for the erstwhile self-assured forward who burst on to the Scottish scene with 11 goals in 10 appearances. VIDEO Scroll down to see Guidetti score a belting free-kick for Sweden U21s . John Guidetti failed to score for the fifth consecutive game during the 0-0 draw against Ross County . Deila admitted that Guidetti, who has been substituted in every game of his drought, now needs help to overcome the surprise slump as Celtic prepare for a Glasgow derby against Partick Thistle on Thursday. ‘He is struggling at the moment, you can see that,’ said Deila. ‘His ambitions are very high and he is even more disappointed than everyone else. ‘The only people who can do something about that is us. So we have to work hard in training every day and see what we can do to get it going. ‘We know that he can score goals, he has done it before. He hasn’t become a much worse player in a month, it is just small details that we are going to have to turn around. The on loan Manchester City striker puts his hands to head after missing a gilt-edged chance . ‘He will come back. My challenge — and his as well — would be get that back as quickly as possible.’ Despite the first scoreless league draw in over three years at Parkhead, Celtic extended their title lead to five points over Dundee United. However, Deila’s bid to build on that advantage for the remainder of the festive period could be undermined by an injury to Anthony Stokes. The Irishman suffered a calf strain nine minutes into yesterday’s game and Deila was unsure of the striker’s prospects of facing Thistle or Kilmarnock next Monday night. Celtic manager Ronny Deila watches on as his side fail to beat Ross County at Celtic Park on Saturday . Deila will be hoping the surfaces on their travels, including the artificial one at Rugby Park, is better than the one at Parkhead that he feels is not currently conducive to his preferred style of play. ‘The pitch is not 100 per cent right now so we have to use one extra touch and the attacks get slower,’ he complained. ‘It’s a bit bumpy but that is not an excuse, we should have created a lot more. ‘If you can get an early goal it is important as well, they have to attack and try to lose something and there is a bit more space. ‘In the end it was a lack of creativity and tempo.’","Celtic endured a frustrating goalless draw with Ross County on Saturday .

"Stoke manager Mark Hughes believes Louis van Gaal is the 'strong figurehead' Manchester United need and insists the Red Devils can still win the title this season. United are unbeaten since November 2 and have won seven of their last nine league matches ahead of their trip to the Britannia Stadium on New Year's Day. That run has seen Van Gaal's side climb to third and Hughes, who played 467 times for United, believes the Dutchman is starting to make his mark at Old Trafford. Louis van Gaal is a 'strong figurehead' for Manchester United, according to Stoke manager Mark Hughes . Hughes will lead his Stoke City team into battle with United at the Britannia Stadium on New Year's Day . United have rediscovered their winning touch  and are unbeaten in the Premier League since November 2 . United are 10 points behind leaders Chelsea and seven behind second-placed Manchester City in the table . 'Suddenly he seems to be the right figurehead for the club,' Hughes said. 'He's the guy you sense they need given last year was a time of transition for them. 'They're still going through that process to a certain extent so they need a strong person at the head of the club and he certainly gives that impression.' No manager has used more players in the Barclays Premier League this season than Van Gaal, who has handed appearances to 26 of his first-team squad so far. Despite United's excellent run of results, their performances have not always been convincing and Hughes believes Van Gaal is still working out his best team and style of play. 'It's still early days,' Hughes said. 'Van Gaal seems to talk about his philosophy a lot and any philosophy you have as a manager takes time to instil. Van Gaal arrived at Old Trafford in the summer and is assisted by club legend Ryan Giggs . Stoke beat West Brom 2-0 on Sunday and defeated United on home turf last season .

Dec 26 Newcastle United (H) 3-1 . Dec 28 Tottenham (A) 0-0 . 'He's changed personnel, given guys who were out in the cold another opportunity, changing shape and formations. 'That takes time, it takes time for the players to take information on board and perhaps he's clearing his mind for the way he wants to go long-term, only time will tell.' United are 10 points behind league leaders Chelsea and seven back on Manchester City but Hughes feels his opponents on Thursday are still in contention to become champions in May. 'I think they are title contenders, they may have given themselves too much to do - they're 10 points back at the moment and there are very strong teams ahead of them,' Hughes said. 'They're coming into a run of form now which will encourage them and that's what they need to do, they can't afford to have too many more slip ups. 'Hopefully we'll be able to overcome them and that will be four defeats - historically you can't afford more than six to seven. If you have that many defeats it's almost impossible to win the Premier League. 'They'll be aware of that but they have the players to go on an extended run as they're doing at the moment.'

Consecutive wins over Everton and West Brom have pushed Stoke up to 11th in the table, six points behind sixth place. Hughes is delighted with the Potters' progress and wants to add United to an impressive list of scalps this season that already includes Manchester City, Tottenham, Arsenal and Everton. '2014 has been great for us - I think we've picked up more points in the calendar year than any other Stoke team in the Premier League,' Hughes said. 'But United are a good team, it's up to us to ask questions of them. 'Our record against the top teams has been good and they'll know they will be in for a tough game. 'It's a difficult place to come if you're a top team and we need to make sure that continues.'","Manchester United travel to Stoke City on New Year's Day .

In Corriere dello Sport, Rossoneri captain Riccardo Montolivo is pictured lifting the Dubai Football Challenge Trophy following Milan's win against the Spanish giants. Stephan El Shaarawy scored twice, with Jeremy Menez and Giampaolo Pazzini also on target as Filippo Inzaghi's side ended the year on a high, while Real - managed by former Milan boss Carlo Ancelotti - suffered defeat for the first time since September.

"Stephan El Shaarawy helped himself to two goals as Real Madrid were comprehensively beaten by AC Milan in a mid-season friendly in Dubai on Tuesday evening. Carlo Ancelotti's side entered the winter break on the back of a record 22 consecutive wins but Cristiano Ronaldo and Co were second best to a Milan side currently occupying seventh place in Serie A. Jeremy Menez opened the scoring for Pippo Inzaghi's side before El Shaarawy doubled Milan's lead after half an hour. Ronaldo pulled a goal back for Real before half time but El Shaarway netted his second of the game just minutes after the restart. CLICK HERE to read the rest of Sportsmail's Nick Godden's match report from the Dubai friendly. Host commentator . Host commentator . So Real taste 'defeat' for the first time since December with their friendly loss against Milan. Carlo Ancelotti shouldn't be too concerned with his side's performance though as he experimented with his line-up. Expect Los Blancos to come out firing for their La Liga clash against Valencia on Sunday. For Milan, the result will be a boost for them as they look to kick-on in the second half of their season.From me, Luke Augustus - see you soon! And that's it! The referee brings a close to the friendly. Gareth Bale twice comes closing to reducing the scoreline before the full-time but whistle but it ends 4-2 to Milan. 90min: There will be two minutes of added time... 89min: Real are pressing for a third but can't find a way throught the Milan defence. 84min: Benzema makes no mistake from the spot firing the shot into the top left-hand corner. Agazzi dives correctly but the power proves too much for him. Will there an unlikely comeback from the Spanish giants? Real have a small glimmer of hope to get back into this match as Nacho is brought down by Niang inside the Milan penalty box. Benzema stands over the penalty... 81min: Understandably both sides are now going through the motions. Real are away at La Liga rivals Valencia on Sunday, while Milan host Sassoulo on Tuesday. 76min: An interesting change from the Italian side as 16-year-old Hachim Mastour is given a run out. Mastour has been widely tipped as the next Milan superstar so his cameo should prove interesting viewing... 73min: Game, set and match Milan. Substitutes Giampaolo Pazzini and M'Baye Niang combine as the latter crosses with his left-foot for the former to head home at the far post. 66min: Carvajal whips in a brilliant cross that Bale heads just over the bar. In the build-up of that move, Milan's two-goal hero El Shaarawy falls to the floor in a heap. Originally it looks like a hamstring injury but it turns out to be cramp. The Italy international has been plagued by injuries over the last two years and is quickly substituted. 60min: Michael Agazzi has only just come on in place of Diego Alves but already he's into the thick of things - producing a fine stop at his near post to deny Bale. 56min: It seems it will only be a matter of time before Real score a second. Benzema is slipped through on goal but Diego Alves comes out quickly off his line to thwart him. Moments later Jese appeals for a penalty after going down under a challenge but the referee waves plays on. 53min: Oh dear, look away Karim Benzema. Jese weaves his way along the Milan 18-yard box before firing a low shot across goal that hits the post. The follow-up falls to Benzema from eight-yards out with an empty goal but he side-foots his shot over. Carlo Ancelotti's side should be 3-2 ahead but they're starting to crank up the gears. 49min: El Shaarawy came close to making it 3-1 moments prior to actually doing so with his second strike of the match. The Italy international pounces on another Real defensive mistake before side-footing from close-range to score. Real get proceedings underway for the second half... The reason why Real are arguably the best club team in world football at present is due to their strength in depth. Superstars Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale form two thirds of their infamous 'BBC' (Bale, Benzema and Cristiano) frontline but started today's clash on the bench. The deadly duo are both warming up... And breathe. This is meant to be a friendly but it hasn't been anything but so far. Both teams have created a lot of chances and are treating it like a Champions League encounter at times. 45 mins: Bonaventura comes close to make it 3-1 to Milan but his curled shot goes just wide of the post. That marks the last real chance of the opening 45 mins as the referee bring a close to proceedings. 40min: Ronaldo's goal has sparked the game into life. Both sides are now pushing for it, with Milan in particular trying to press for their third goal in the match. The crowd here in Dubai are really getting into too. 35min: Who else would it but that man Cristiano Ronaldo. Real hit AC on the break with Ronaldo slipped through on goal. The iconic No 7 makes no mistake and curls the ball past Diego Alves. Game on. 31min: Could Real taste defeat for the first time in three months? Stephan El Shaarawy makes it two-nil to the Italian side, cutting in from the left flank before unleashing a low right-footed shot which beats Navas at his near post. 28min: Chance for Madrid to respond but after going past the keeper, Sami Khedira runs out of angle and can only turn a cut-back back into a sea of Milan defenders. 24min: It's a deserved lead but it's a nightmare goal for Madrid to concede. Nacho plays just about the worst backpass you are ever likely to see, enabling Jeremy Menez to intercept before rolling an easy finish under Iker Casillas. 19min: This is more like it from Madrid. The European champions are starting to show the form which has seen them win their last 22 games as they begin to boss the midfield. 14min: Madrid's main priority in this game will be to come out of it without any injuries and that objective hasn't started too well. Raphael Varane took a knock trying to beat Bonaventura to a header, while Fabio Coentrao has also received treatment in this game. 12min: Milan are getting closer to an opening goal though as Giacomo Bonaventura just misses out on heading home Riccardo Montolivo's near post header. 9min: Filippo Inzaghi's team continue to control the game, not that the former Italy striker looks too pleased with that. Chances are still lacking but Madrid are clearly not playing to their full potential right now. Ronaldo can't get a touch. 6min: Still Milan look the more dangerous team, with Nigel de Jong in particular getting stuck in - he can't resist a battle after all. The midfielder does well to steal the ball off Cristiano Ronaldo on the edge of the Milan box, before his low drive at the other end moments later is easily collected by Keylor Navas. 3min: Rather surprisingly, AC Milan have been on top in the opening few minutes and while they haven't created a chance in that period - the ball has been entirely in Madrid's half. Good start from the Italian side. Starting XI: Diego Lopez, Bonera, Mexes, Zapata, Albertazzi, Montolivo, De Jong, Muntari, Bonaventura, Menez, El Shaarawy. Subs: Agazzi, Abbiati, Pazzini, Rami, Essien, Poli, Niang, Saponara, Armero, Dias, Da Costa, Zaccardo, Mastour. Casillas, Pacheco, Pepe, Kroos, Benzema, Rodriguez, Bale, Carvajal, Raul de Tomas, D.

"Former Chelsea and Newcastle boss Ruud Gullit has questioned how long Luis Suarez will remain a Barcelona player after admitting his surprise at the Uruguayan's £75million move. Suarez left Liverpool last summer to sign for the Catalan giants, going on to make his debut in October after returning from a four-month ban for biting Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup. The 27-year-old has only scored once in eight La Liga appearances so far and Gullit is unsure whether he can adapt to life in Spain.

Speaking to beIN Sports last weekend, Gullit said: 'It is a surprise to see Suarez at Barcelona. I don't know how long he will stay there.' The former Ajax forward has netted twice in three Champions League appearances since swapping Merseyside for Barcelona, although his striker partners - Lionel Messi and Neymar - have both outshone him this season. Suarez scored his first league goal in Barca's 5-0 home against Cordoba on Saturday, a result which moved Luis Enrique's men one point behind leaders Real Madrid.

"Stoke striker Mame Biram Diouf scored both goals in a comfortable win against Wes tBrom to earn a week at the top of the EA Sports' Player Performance Index PPI chart, while Liverpool's Adam Lallana, Philippe Coutinho and Alberto Moreno feature on the list. Here, EA Sports crunch the numbers to reveal the 10 best Premier League performers from the weekend. Santi Cazorla also makes the top three but who else completes this week's big 10? Mame Biram Diouf (left) tops the chart this week after bagging a match-winning brace against West Brom . 10. Jack Colback, Newcastle (PPI score: 30.2) Newcastle midfielder Colback scored his first goal since joining the club in the summer during Sunday's thrilling 3-2 victory against Everton at St James' Park. The 25-year-old netted Newcastle's third, which turned out to be the winner and the midfielder completed an impressive 85.7 per cent of his passes. The EA Sports PPI is the official player rating index of the  Premier League. It measures a player's contribution to the success of his team. The intention is to remove any opinion bias and only work with proven statistical measurements which become more accurate as the season progresses. So, what are the six indices? 1. Winning performance . 2. Player's performance per match . 3. Appearances . 4. Goals scored . 5. Assists . 6. Clean sheets . 9. Cheikhou Kouyate, West Ham (PPI score: 30.2) Kouyate netted his first Premier League goal against Arsenal on Sunday, but was not able to stop his side falling to a 2-1 defeat at Upton Park. The combative 25-year-old also made three interceptions and successfully completed two tackles in the middle of the Hammers midfield . 8. David Silva, Manchester City (PPI score: 30.6) The diminutive Spain international scored his fourth Premier League goal in his last three games as Manchester City ended up throwing away a two-goal lead against Burnley. Silva completed a remarkable 56 passes in the opposition half and finished the match with a pass success rate of 82.8 per cent. Jack Colback netted his first goal for Newcastle during the win against Everton on Sunday . David Silva makes it to number eight on the list after scoring his fourth goal in three games against Burnley . 7. Alberto Moreno, Liverpool (PPI score: 35.2) Moreno opened the scoring for Liverpool as Brendan Rodgers' side beat Swansea 4-1 at Anfield on Monday night. Playing in a left wing back role the 22-year-old broke into the Swansea box to get on the end of Jordan Henderson's first-half cross. Moreno also successfully completed three tackles. 6. Philippe Coutinho, Liverpool (PPI score: 35.4) Another key player in Liverpool's win against Swansea was Brazilian playmaker Coutinho. The 22-year-old tested Lukasz Fabianski three times and won three tackles for his side. Coutinho also completed 31 passes in the opposition half as the former Inter Milan midfielder looked back to his best as he orchestrated much of Liverpool's good attacking play. 5. Papiss Cisse, Newcastle (PPI score: 36.7) Cisse was lucky to stay on the pitch after an apparent elbow on Seamus Coleman - something the Newcastle striker has since been charged for - but the 29-year-old did score his ninth league of the season during his side's 3-2 win against Everton. Cisse also used the ball well for Newcastle, evidenced by his 93.8 per cent pass completion. 4. Riyad Mahrez, Leicester City (PPI score: 38.7) Algerian international Mahrez earned basement club Leicester a precious three points as he scored the winning goal in a 1-0 win away to fellow strugglers Hull City on Sunday. The tricky winger also completed six successful tackles as Nigel Pearson's side won for the first time since September. Philippe Coutinho impressed during Liverpool's 4-1 win against Swansea, making it to No 6 in the charts . Papiss Cisse scored his ninth Premier League goal of the season as Newcastle beat Everton 3-2 . Riyad Mahrez netted the winner for Leicester against Hull and earns a spot in the top four . 3. Santi Cazorla, Arsenal (PPI score: 46) Cazorla netted his fourth goal in his last five appearances when he slotted home a first-half penalty during Sunday's 2-1 win against West Ham. The Spain international had three shots on target during the match and had a pass completion rate of 81.4 per cent. Santi Cazorla makes the top three after netting in Arsenal's win against West Ham on Sunday . 2. Adam Lallana, Liverpool (PPI score: 55) The Liverpool midfielder produced his best performance since joining the club this summer during the win against Swansea and the former Southampton midfielder scored a brace. Lallana also made five successful tackles and completed 83.3 per cent of his passes. Adam Lallana's two goals for Liverpool was only enough to bag him second in the charts . 1. Mame Biram Diouf, Stoke (PPI score: 55.1) Stoke striker Diouf tops this week's chart after scoring both goals during his side's 2-0 victory against West Brom on Sunday. Diouf ended a run of eight games without finding the target as Mark Hughes' team made it back-to-back wins in the Premier League following the Boxing Day win against Everton.

Caretaker Nathan Jones is expected to stay on, either as the new man's assistant or first team coach at Brighton. Chris Hughton has been named as the new manager of Championship side Brighton & Hove Albion . Sami Hyypia  resigned as manager of Brighton  on December 22 after a dismal start to the season . Chairman Tony Bloom told the club's website: 'Chris has an excellent record in coaching and management.

'He is someone who has a real wealth of experience in the top two divisions, from nearly 15 years at Spurs as a coach, assistant and interim manager, through to his more recent work in the Premier League and Championship. 'Chris is also a manager who has a track record for developing talent at all levels from academy upwards and will embrace the work we've been doing at the club in this area in recent seasons.

"Jonjo Shelvey faces a four-match ban after he was charged with violent conduct by the FA for allegedly elbowing Emre Can in the face during Swansea City’s defeat at his old club Liverpool on Monday night. However, Liverpool’s Raheem Sterling will face no action over an apparent slap on Swansea defender Federico Fernandez later in the game because referee Andre Marriner said in his report on Tuesday that it was spotted by the match officials at the time. Marriner confirmed that the incident involving Shelvey and Can went unseen, which has enabled the FA to act. Jonjo Shelvey has been charged by the FA for throwing an elbow at Emre Can at Anfield on Monday night . Shelvey catches the Liverpool midfielder in the face during another performance that prompted criticism . Shelvey clearly threw his arm in the direction of Can as Swansea slumped to defeat . Can reacts after being hit in the face with Shelvey's flailing arm . Shelvey has until 6pm on Wednesday to respond to the charge. He can either accept it and receive an automatic ban or ask for his case to be heard by a disciplinary commission at 7pm. Either way, the 22-year-old will be suspended for four games if found guilty because he has already been sent off once before this season after picking up two yellow cards at Everton on his last return to Merseyside in November. After the match, Shelvey's former Anfield team-mate Jamie Carragher criticised him afterwards, and revealed that such flashpoints were not uncommon at the club's Melwood training ground when they were there. Shelvey took to Twitter to explain what happened and insisted he would not set out to hurt an opponent . 'It's absolute madness,' said Carragher. 'You'd see this two or three times a week in training. He has bags of ability, Shelvey, but unfortunately he can do stuff like that too.' Shelvey, who joined Swansea from Liverpool for £5million last year, had earlier pleaded his innocence on Twitter by saying that the elbow was unintentional and he had apologised to Can. He wrote: ‘Just wanna say didn’t intentionally elbow emre can was just trying to get my arm across to get round him and it’s come off as I'm trying to hurt another play and I can assure you that, that isn’t the case. And I had apologised to emre can for catching him.’ Shelvey capped off a forgettable evening by scoring an own goal for Liverpool's fourth . Swansea boss Garry Monk also defended Shelvey, saying: ‘I spoke to Jonjo on the way home and he said his intention was not to catch the player at all. He said the player was tugging on him and he was just trying to push him away. ‘I don’t think it was an intentional elbow at all and the referee was perfectly placed. No-one had a better view of the incident than him. He felt it didn’t warrant any more action and the game went on.’ Carragher's fellow Sky TV pundit Gary Neville claimed that the offence was worse than the one that earned Liverpool's Lazar Markovic a straight red card against Basle earlier this month. The 22-year-old watches as his headers finds the back of the net at Anfield . 'Garry Monk has already talked about the lack of discipline from Shelvey ahead of this game and this just proves it,' said Neville. 'When you first see it you can't really see it but on second viewing it is not pretty at all. He swings into Can. 'The problem is the referee cannot put in his report that he hasn't seen that because he is never going to have a better view of it than he has there. It's not as bad as the Papiss Cisse one (elbow on Everton's Seamus Coleman) but it is worse than the Markovic one we saw a few weeks ago.' 'He has seen it (the Shelvey incident). There's no way he can't have not seen it. Andre Marriner can see it. 15 years ago you would have got a yellow card most, or maybe not even a yellow card, but he is a lucky boy because he throws the arm out. 'Andre Marriner needs to look at that freeze because he cannot say he has not seen that arm come out and hit him if he wants any credibility in the game.'

"It began, as anything good around that club usually does, with Johan Cruyff. His Foundation, author of so much good, had raised sufficient money to invest in a ‘Cruyff Court’ — the all-weather, five-a-side pitch which, for some time, he’s been gifting to local communities around the world (187 total, nine in Spain) so that young kids continue to have a space in which to enjoy the beautiful game. This one, however, was a story close to my affection. When I talked to Xavi during the process of writing ‘Barca: The Making Of The Greatest Team In The World’, it was horrible to discover that the Plaza del Progreso, in Terrassa, the town outside Barcelona where he grew up, now had a sign reading: ‘Fútbol Prohibido’. Xavi scores the opening goal for Barcelona in their 3-0 victory over Eibar in October . Xavi (right) celebrates Gerard Pique's goal during Barcelona's 5-0 win over Cordoba on Saturday . Xavi (right) decided to stay at Barcelona this season and has been in fine form . In a Canal+ interview, Xavi emphasised: ‘They’ve made it very nice now, very modern, but they’ve screwed it up for kids — no chance of playing football there now.’ One of the principal architects of Spain reaching its apogee could look at the very place where he first learned to perfect his treatment of the ball and find that his successors were banned from doing the same. The very kids who would be inspired by Barcelona’s glorious footballing symphonies, by Spain lifting the World Cup. Cruyff was paying attention. So one day in October, he and Xavi inaugurated the pitch thanks to €30,000 (£23,478) from La Caixa, the bank which sponsored them in the project. The master and maestro then got to talking. ‘Cruyff reminded me that the most beautiful thing in our lives was playing,’ said the 34-year-old. Johan Cruyff became a legend at Barcelona first as a player and later as a manager . Cruyff has been central to the development of Barcelona's current style of play . ‘But the closest feeling to replicating that is to coach. I love to wake up sure in the knowledge that I’m going to smell the grass of a pitch and to hear the smack of a boot hitting a ball. That is my life and I know I want to stay in football.’ Not unlike his movement on and off the ball during his prime, Xavi has been hard to pin down. Sometimes he will say he is going to coach, or manage, and sometimes he’s appalled by the stress, the criticism, the politics. However, the Cruyff conversation seems to have made the idea gel. After Spain’s disastrous World Cup, the Catalan had made up his mind to join David Villa and Frank Lampard in signing for New York City. Cruyff (second right) and Pep Guardiola (right) pose for pictures in 2010 . But, talking to new Barca coach Luis Enrique, he was given a direct message. One he liked. ‘If you stay, and you are in good enough form, you’ll play. If not, you won’t.’ No hidden agenda, no edict to push the ageing high-earner off the wage bill. He stayed. Thus far, he’s played 17 times and been amongst Barca’s best performers. The intense style of ‘Lucho’ Enrique has invigorated him, re-introduced subtle flavours of the Pep Guardiola era. And it’s to Guardiola, unfortunately, that people’s minds turn when the prospect of Xavi one day taking over at the Nou Camp is raised. But, caution. As a player Xavi was slotted straight into the same pivot position which Guardiola (now Sergio Busquets) occupied. It wasn’t right for him and a handful of years were ‘wasted’ there until Frank Rijkaard pushed him into attacking midfield — much to Xavi’s concern and doubt. Xavi and his former manager Guardiola (right) are different personalities . Xavi (right) and Guardiola (second right) vent their frustration to a referee . Xavi (centre) was an instrumental part of Guardiola's success during his spell as Barcelona manager . Equally, as a coach, Xavi will not replicate Guardiola. The two men are very different in nature. By 21, Guardiola was a boss in the dressing room and on the pitch. Tough, pragmatic, streetwise — born to lead. Xavi became that, but it took him much more time. He’s a generous, quick-to-share, quick-to-smile guy — but he’ll wound more easily, ‘feel’ more than the supremely-driven Guardiola. ‘At Barca, “pretty good” is worth nothing,’ Xavi says. ‘I’m hugely demanding of myself and, indeed, of friends and family. Sometimes I realise it’s too much. But so much has been demanded of me all my life and that has conditioned me to expect that from others. ‘If I get a “well done” rather than an “excellent”, I go home troubled.’ Guardiola is different. Winning is everything, excellence is a means to that end. Perhaps it sounds a minor difference, but it will count when, in due course, Xavi takes charge of a team. Potentially Barca.","Xavi, having changed his mind, is now expected to go into coaching .
Xavi is likely to place more emphasis on beautiful football than Guardiola .
Guardiola and Xavi have both been inspired by Johan Cruyff ."

"When Amir Khan was told that Kell Brook’s promoter Eddie Hearn has put Wembley Stadium on hold for the pair of them to fight on June 13, his response was as sharp and to the point as the punches which had just pounded Devon Alexander to defeat in what may prove to be the pivotal fight of his career. ‘How can he book a stadium without even talking to me?’ Khan asked. ‘It’s disrespectful. It would be like me sending a message to Floyd Mayweather that I’ve booked Wembley for next summer and I’m expecting him to be there.’ That said, Khan made it clear that he will examine all possible options for a mega-fight with Mayweather or Manny Pacquiao before even considering a world championship Battle of Britain with Brook. VIDEO Scroll for Eddie Hearn: Kell Brook will be demanding Amir and Floyd by summer . Amir Khan on his way to a comfortable victory over Devon Alexander in what was a brilliant performance . Khan was never troubled as he cruised towards one of the most impressive performances of his career . ‘If I just went ahead and agreed to fight Kell it could prevent me ever getting the fight with Floyd or Manny,’ said Khan. ‘They usually box in spring and in the autumn. Boxing Brook in June would rule me out of either of their dates next year – and after that they could both retire. ‘That would kill my ambition to prove myself against the very best. As far as styles are concerned, I would love to fight Brook. He’s slower and defensive and he could not cope with my speed and power. it would be a huge fight in Britain. But only in Britain, not in America or elsewhere. 'I want to make a global impact and the way to do that is to fight Mayweather or Pacquiao.’ Although Saturday’s brilliant victory represented the last bout on Khan’s contract with Oscar De La Hoya’s Golden Boy promotions, he says: ‘I will talk with Oscar next week about making the super-fights.’ But the picture has been clouded by Mayweather’s sudden announcement that he is ready to meet Pacquiao in the richest fight in ring history, in Las Vegas on May 2. Kell Brook wants to fight Khan next year but his British rival is reluctant to commit to the showdown . Brook celebrates winning his world title against Shawn Porter in Los Angeles in August . ‘Sky gave me that news an hour before I went into the ring against Alexander,’ says Khan. ‘Nice one boys. But it proved I can put distractions out of my mind and focus on the job at hand. ‘Just as I’ve done what Floyd asked by proving that I’m worthy of fighting him. And remember that he said he would fight me earlier this year but it didn’t happen. Now he’s saying he’ll fight Manny so we’ll see what happens.’ Khan reveals that he has been asked by Paquiao’s business manager, Michael Koncz, if he would be interested in fighting the PacMan: ‘I said yes.’ A match with Mayweather, who stood him up this May, might be easier to make since both he and Khan have the Machiavellian figure of Al Haymon as their advisor.

"Anthony Crolla is ‘lucky to be alive’ and faces an uncertain future in boxing after suffering horrific injuries while attempting to stop two burglars from raiding his next-door neighbour’s house. The world title contender is likely to remain in hospital until the weekend after having scans on the fractured skull he suffered when he was hit with a concrete slab during the vicious altercation near Oldham on Tuesday night. Crolla also had surgery on Wednesday on his right ankle, which was broken in two places, though the 28-year-old’s condition has been described as ‘stable’ by his trainer Joe Gallagher, who had been preparing the lightweight for a world title fight next month. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Tyson Fury sends message of support to Anthony Crolla . Anthony Crolla (left) is in hospital after suffering injuries in an altercation with a burglar . THOMAS STALKER: Gutted for @ant_crolla tonight it just doesn't shock me at all at this day in age, get well soon m8! SCOTT QUIGG: Absolutely gutted for my gym mate @ant_crolla with his dream within touching distance!

AMIR KHAN: Really sorry to hear the news about @ant_crolla hope you get well soon mate . TONY BELLEW: My heart goes out to him! The nicest kid in boxing full stop! Gallagher told Sportsmail: ‘He is devastated, absolutely heartbroken, but he’s trying to put a brave face on it. Ant is such a lovely lad and was trying to help a neighbour. He was getting ready for the biggest night of his career but all that is up in the air now. ‘I am just relieved he is alive. This could have been far worse when you think what happened. He is in a bad way but he is lucky to be alive. It’s too early to know what effect this will have on his career and to be honest I don’t want him thinking about it.’ Crolla said late on Wednesday: 'I am absolutely amazed at the amount of support. I’ve been taken aback with the amount of goodwill from fans and friends. 'I feel blessed to have this amount of support. I was only doing what any normal person would do in protecting my neighbour’s property. 'Despite everything, I’m determined to fulfil my dream, and come back to become a world champion in 2015.' The grim details are that Crolla was at home in Chadderton when he heard the burglar alarm sounding from next door. Crolla lands a punch on John Murray on his way to victory over his close friend in Manchester this year . After a phone call went unanswered, Crolla is believed to have spotted through a window that his neighbour’s patio door had been caved in. Crolla is understood to have shouted at the intruders, who fled. The 5ft 8in boxer chased and caught one, but the other is alleged to have hit him over the head with a slab of concrete. ‘Had it been at a slightly different angle then Anthony might have been killed,’ Gallagher added. ‘When he was hit he fell and broke his ankle. He has a deep cut down his head from his hairline to eyebrow. He’s had stitches and he had surgery on his ankle and they’ve had to put pins in.’ Craig Townsend, whose house was being burgled, said: ‘I texted him last night to thank him and say sorry for everything. He replied saying, “Don’t worry about it, we’re neighbours, we look after each other”. His attitude says everything about him, he’s just a great guy.’ Crolla was due to challenge Richar Abril for the Cuban’s WBA lightweight world title on January 23 at the Manchester Arena. That fight has been postponed and Crolla’s promoter, Eddie Hearn, is in talks to rearrange the bout. But it is not yet known whether the fighter will be able to return to the ring. Gallagher, who was with Crolla in hospital in Oldham yesterday and on Tuesday night, said: ‘He is devastated, obviously. This guy was about to fight for a world title. At the moment that’s not important, all that matters is his health. Crolla was due to fight Richar Abril for the WBA lightweight title next month but that has been shelved . ‘But we’ve been joking as well. I was asking him, “Who do you think you are, Batman? Did you think you were going to put them both in headlocks and frogmarch them to the police station?”. ‘This wasn’t his house, but it shows the kind of guy he is that he was trying to help a neighbour.’ Hearn said: ‘Unfortunately the January 23 fight is off but our concerns right now are with Ant and his family. ‘I have spoken to Richar Abril’s team and we are trying to reschedule the fight.’ Detective Sergeant Richard Arthern said: ‘The victim was outraged that these two men had broken into his neighbour’s home and gave chase. When he caught up with one of them he was hit with such force, he received a fractured skull. ‘He staggered backwards and fell to the ground, leaving him with a broken ankle and in a lot of pain.’ Crolla has won 29 of his 35 fights and next month’s would have provided the biggest payday of his career.","Anthony Crolla confronted two intruders and 'lucky to be alive'

"Jonjo Shelvey was accused of ‘absolute madness’  after flinging an arm recklessly into the face of Emre Can during Liverpool’s emphatic victory over Swansea at Anfield. Shelvey, who also scored an own goal in the 4-1 defeat to his old club, had already been warned about his discipline in the build-up to the game by Swansea boss Garry Monk who criticised the player’s ‘laziness’. And he landed himself in more controversy by catching Can in the first half. Referee Andre Marriner was a few yards from the incident and decided not to award a freekick, but it remains to be seen if the FA take a different view. Liverpool’s Raheem Sterling may also be in hot water after he appeared to hit out at Federico Fernandez in the second half. Jonjo Shelvey (left) had another evening to forget as Swansea lost 4-1 to Liverpool . The former Reds star leaves the pitch after scoring an own goal and courting controversy with an elbow . Shelvey’s former Anfield teammate Jamie Carragher criticised him afterwards, and revealed that such flashpoints were not uncommon at the club’s Melwood training ground when they were there. ‘It’s absolute madness,’ said Carragher. ‘You'd see this two or three times a week in training. He has bags of ability, Shelvey, but unfortunately he can do stuff like that too.’ Carragher’s fellow Sky TV pundit Gary Neville claimed that the offence was worse than the one that earned Liverpool’s Lazar Markovic a straight red card against Basle earlier this month. 'Garry Monk has already talked about the lack of discipline from Shelvey ahead of this game and this just proves it,’ said Neville. ‘When you first see it you can't really see it but on second viewing it is not pretty at all. He swings into Can. ‘The problem is the referee cannot put in his report that he hasn't seen that because he is never going to have a better view of it than he has there. It's not as bad as the Papiss Cisse one (elbow on Everton’s Seamus Coleman) but it is worse than the Markovic one we saw a few weeks ago.' The Swansea star was caught on camera flinging an elbow towards Emre Can during the first half . Shelvey catches the Liverpool midfielder in the face during another performance that prompted criticism . Despite Can going to ground complaining he had been struck, Shelvey escaped without punishment . Shelvey, who has already collected six yellow cards and a red this campaign, should escape retrospective punishment for this latest brush with trouble because Marriner saw the incident. But it was just one more problem for Monk on a night when he had hoped to show his team could make a challenge for the European places. Shelvey, who joined Swansea from Liverpool for £5million last year, was restored to the starting line-up last night. Monk admitted afterwards that he had not seen the incident but would look at it on the journey back to South Wales. The Swansea boss might not be impressed if he sees footage of Shelvey joking with Liverpool’s Adam Lallana at a corner moments before heading into his own net. ‘I haven’t seen it,’ said Monk. ‘I’ve been asked that question already and I’ll have to look at it on the way home and judge it. ‘But I thought he played fantastic tonight, very good. That was the Jonjo that I know and he showed that quality with his passing.’ Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers tried to play down both incidents involving Shelvey and Sterling. ‘I have seen the two,’ said Rodgers. ‘The cameras will probably show it a hundred times tomorrow and we will get bored of watching it. ‘Jonjo has flung his arm out and caught Emre on the side of his head. Young Raheem’s incident, the centre half has slapped him on the side of the head and he has put his hand up and slapped him on the side of the head. ‘I think the referee has called both right and got on with the game.’ Shelvey capped off a forgettable evening by scoring an own goal for Liverpool's fourth . The 22-year-old watches as his headers finds the back of the net at Anfield . Shelvey is likely to come under scrutiny after being seen joking with Adam Lallana before the corner . Shelvey's evening got even worse when he scored an own goal as he flicked Jordan Henderson's corner past Lukasz Fabianski at the near post. The own goal extinguished any hope Swansea had of getting back into the match as Liverpool opened up a three-goal lead with just 20 minutes to play. Shelvey was marking Adam Lallana at the near post and was caught laughing and joking with the Liverpool midfielder prior to the corner being taken. 'I don't think Garry Monk will be too pleased with Shelvey (having a bit of a chuckle with Lallana) when you're losing,' Carragher said after the game. 'I never saw the benefit of laughing or smiling at an opposition player,' Neville added. 'I mean all it can be is a distraction. I can't see how it can work, particularly from a set piece. I don't think Garry Monk will be happy with it and in fact the only person it helped was Lallana.'","Jonjo Shelvey had been warned by boss Garry Monk about his discipline .

"Cesc Fabregas was on the receiving end of a harsh booking as his side chased a winner in their 1-1 draw with Southampton at St Mary's. With the scores level on the hour mark and Chelsea continuing to pile on the pressure, the Blues midfielder was brought down in the Southampton box by rookie defender Matt Targett.

"Few thought the Chelsea juggernaut could be stopped this season, but Didier Drogba always expected the title race to go down to the wire. The west Londoners started the campaign in astonishing form, leading one bookmaker to pay out on them winning the Premier League after just 11 matches. Chelsea boasted an eight-point cushion over Manchester City at that point, although that lead now stands at just three. The gap would have been a single point had Manuel Pellegrini's men not blown a two-goal lead to draw with Burnley and fans' favourite Drogba insists complacency is not behind the difference being cut. Ashley Barnes (centre) celebrates scoring Burnley's equaliser against Manchester City on Sunday . 'I think it's going to be tough,' Drogba said. 'We knew it was not over. 'A few years ago, I think we were 11 or 12 points in front of Man United and then they won the league. 'So eight points or nine points - I don't know how many points we had on top of Man City - I think it is not enough. 'At that time of the season, it was too early, but I think now we start again a new championship. I think the game is on.' Chelsea will enter 2015 atop of the standings and were in the lead at Christmas - something which has proven a good omen in the past for Jose Mourinho. Didier Drogba brings the ball down on his chest as Southampton's Toby Alderweireld closes in . The Portuguese has won the league on all seven occasion his sides have been leading on December 25, but he suggests they would be in an even more comfortable position had the Blues not been the victim of a diving campaign. Mourinho went on that rant after being denied what he felt was a potentially match-defining penalty early in the second half of Sunday's 1-1 draw at Southampton, when Cesc Fabregas went down under pressure from Matt Targett. Instead of a spot-kick, however, referee Anthony Taylor deemed it a dive and booked the infuriated Spanish midfielder - part of a what Mourinho believes is a growing movement against his side. 'It's difficult from the bench to see, but I think the referee was close enough,' Drogba said of the Fabregas incident. Jose Mourinho was fuming after referee Anthony Taylor failed to give a penalty for this foul on Cesc Fabregas . 'It's his (the referee's) opinion. I don't know what to say. '[Fabregas] said it was a penalty, so I believe him. But, you know, it was still 1-1.' Asked if diving something the players talk about between themselves or with the manager, Drogba retorted: 'No. No. No. I think it is too much. 'Sometimes this kind of thing. I think it is a game, and the game is fast, so these kind of things can happen. But it's not too much.' Mourinho's public comments about diving glossed over what was an at times ropey display at St Mary's. Chelsea dominated in the second period but Hazard's equaliser late first-half stoppage time was the only shot on target they mustered all afternoon. Eden Hazard (centre) celebrates scoring Chelsea's equaliser against Southampton at St Mary's . 'I don't know [what was missing],' Drogba said.

"'Harry Kane reminds me of a young Thomas Muller,' Owen Hargreaves said on BT Sport before the game. Perhaps an ambitious claim at this early stage of his career, but that a young Englishman is being compared to a World Cup-winning German is testament to Kane's progress this season. His stats are impressive. 15 goals in all competitions this term, second only to Sergio Aguero in the Premier League standings, and level with Arsenal's star man Alexis Sanchez. Harry Kane's main battle against Manchester United came against centre-back Paddy McNair (left) Kane (left) takes a shot at the United goal, but it is a simple save for Spanish goalkeeper David de Gea . Fifty Tottenham appearances, 20 goals. And now a chance to impress against Manchester United. Louis van Gaal's side are a team on the up, but have struggled with injuries defensively this season. Against Spurs on Sunday, they started with Phil Jones, Paddy McNair and Jonny Evans. A British back three for an English forward to attack. And attack he did. It took just six minutes for him to make an impact, nearly threading the ball through to Ryan Mason after brushing McNair off with ease. The game was quiet for large spells. Nobody was outstanding, and it finished goalless. Nevertheless, Kane was impressive, as always. There was a moment midway through the second half that summed up his performance. He was anonymous at times, but worked hard behind the scenes. Kane once again battles past Northern Irish centre-back McNair (right) during Spurs' game against United . The 21-year-old Englishman did not set the pitch alight, but his work behind the scenes is very effective . Drifting into the midfield, the 21-year-old Englishman intercepted a United pass, knocked the ball to a team-mate and drove into the opposition half. They lost the ball, and two minutes later Kane was back repeating the same task. This time, he nicked the ball from a United man and took the ball with him, bursting through a gap in the midfield. He wasn't creating chance after chance as he sometimes does, but instead working hard for his team in a deeper area of the pitch. When Spurs are attacking, Kane is the main man. When they are on the back foot - as they were for large parts of Sunday's game - the Englishman drops in and fights to regain possession for his team-mates. Hugo Lloris (centre) took the plaudits after a number of impressive saves, but Kane was a close second . Robin van Persie had a golden opportunity to put United ahead, but Frenchman Lloris was equal to it . As with the early chance, Kane was the provider for a Spurs attack late on in the match. A golden opportunity to win it, in fact. He did what he does best, running at the United back-line with speed and power. Cutting inside, he could have shot, but instead threaded a deft ball through to Mason. It was blasted over the bar, but gave a glimpse of what Kane can do. He is from the same east London borough as former England captain David Beckham. Roy Hodgson will be watching his progress closely, and at just 21 there is a strong possibility Tottenham's star turn will become a stalwart in the England ranks too. Hugo Lloris rightly took the plaudits after a brilliant goalkeeping display, but Kane was there again, discreetly going about his business. He tirelessly worked for 90 minutes without ever being outstanding. Quietly efficient - exactly how the German team are routinely described. Perhaps that Muller comparison isn't far out, after all.","Owen Hargreaves described Harry Kane as 'like a young Thomas Muller'

"Louis van Gaal has once again bemoaned the Premier League's Christmas schedule after his Manchester United side failed to score against Tottenham. Speaking to BT Sport after the game, Van Gaal claimed that 48 hours rest is not enough time for his players to recuperate, explaining that his side began to struggle in the latter stages. 'The second half was a struggle. You can see the players can't recover in two days. It was an ugly match. We played very well in the first half, but [if] you don't score goals, you cannot win. Louis van Gaal has bemoaned the Christmas fixtures, and says that 48 hours is not enough time to recover .

Despite this, the Dutchman waxed lyrical about his side's first-half display, labelling it as the best 45 minutes his United have played all season. When asked it a draw was a fair result, Van Gaal said: 'No, we lost two points. It was the best performance of Manchester United this season, in the first half.

In an even second half, both sides had golden opportunities to snatch three points. 'We gave three chances away,' Van Gaal continued, 'but we could also have scored three opportunities.

"Burnley fought back from two goals down to draw 2-2 with Premier League champions Manchester City on Sunday. Danny Ings was dangerous throughout for The Clarets while Eliaquim Mangala had another poor game for Manuel Pellegrini's side. Find out how the other players got on with Sportsmail's player ratings. MANCHESTER CITY . Joe Hart - 6 . Might have done better for Boyd's goal, allowed the ball to creep in. Summer signing Eliaquim Mangala had a poor game against the energetic Danny Ings on Sunday . Pablo Zabaleta - 6 . Usual overlapping runs and infectious energy. His attacking threat so important to City but became quite reckless in the second half. Eliaquim Mangala - 4.5 . Couldn’t cope with Ings’ quick feet and speed on the turn. Has improved of late but this was a flashback to the unconvincing performances of the autumn. Martin Demichelis - 6 . His experience should have counted for more in that second half. Demichelis has been excellent of late but naturally City need Kompany back - and quickly. Ashley Barnes wheels away in celebration, as Joe Hart watches the shot hit the back of his net . Aleksandar Kolarov - 5 . Good outlet for City in attack but struggled to keep Tripper quiet going the other way. Fernando - 6 . Useful anchor in the midfield and gives City good balance. Influence waned in the second half. Fernandinho - 7 . Beautiful curling effort to score his first goal of the season. Has recovered from World Cup nightmare with Brazil and now in good nick. Jesus Navas - 6.5 . Laid on Silva’s opening goal but can be wasteful with his delivery. Fernandinho's shot fly towards Tom Heaton's goal, where it nestled in the top corner at the Etihad Stadium . David Silva - 7 . Terrific again. Time seems to stand still when he has the ball and he affirms that the coolest minds cause the greatest destruction. Samir Nasri - 5 . A little subdued playing from the left and not at his best. Struggled to influence the game. James Milner - 5.5 . Poor display and he will be looking forward to returning to midfield duties. David Silva shoots through the Burnley defence to open the scoring after spinning in the 18-yard box . Subs . Stevan Jovetic (for Milner, 62) - 5 . Looked short of match fitness and couldn’t find a third goal for City. Frank Lampard (for Samir Nasri, 76) - 5.5 . Couldn’t find another important goal to nick the points for City. Scott Sinclair (for Fernandinho, 88) - 5.5 . Last throw of the dice by Pellegrini didn’t come off. Kieran Trippier battles for the ball with Nasri during the match between Manchester City and Burnley . BURNLEY . Tom Heaton - 6 . Helpless for the goals but one fine save from Nasri in the second half. Kieran Trippier - 6 . Better going forward than defensively. Several dangerous deliveries caused anxiety in City defence. Jason Shackell - 6 . Might have got closer to Silva for the first goal. Unfamiliar challenge with Milner an orthodox frontman. Manchester United loanee Michael Keane competes for the ball with Samir Nasri and James Milner . Michael Keane - 6.5 . Nervous start from Manchester United loanee but grew into the game with a composed showing. Ben Mee - 6 . Former City defender found it tough going against the pace of Navas and energy of Zabaleta. Scott Arfield - 6 . Diligent in the midfield and forward-thinking with his passing. Did well on the left flank in the second half. Dean Marney - 6.5 . Came close to an equaliser in the second half with a long range strike. Crowded out by sheer weight of numbers in the City midfield. George Boyd spreads his arms wide in celebration after netting his side's first goal at the Etihad on Sunday . David Jones - 6 . Testing afternoon against the power and dynamism of Fernandinho and Fernando in midfield but improved as it went on. George Boyd - 6.5 . Gives Burnley balance from the left and offers flair and industry for Sean Dyche’s team. Ashley Barnes - 7.5 . Magnificent strike to secure a point and that’s his third in four games. Danny Ings - 7 . Strength and pace constantly challenged Mangala but first-touch let him down in promising positions a few times.

"Queens Park Rangers boss Harry Redknapp is ready to offer Andros Townsend an escape route out of White Hart Lane, where he has fallen out of favour this season. Redknapp has prioritised a winger and a centre-forward in the transfer window and thinks 23-year-old Townsend can help Rangers beat the drop. Townsend produced the best form of his career while on loan at Loftus Road under Redknapp two seasons ago. Out-of-favour Tottenham winger Andros Townsend could be offered an escape route to QPR . The move would see Townsend reunited with Harry Redknapp at Queens Park Rangers . The winger has endured a nightmare 2014, with ankle surgery ruling him out of the world Cup having played an instrumental role in helping England qualify. He then found himself out of favour under Mauricio Pochettino and has been started in just one Premier League match this season. Townsend has featured more prominently in the UEFA Europa League, starting seven matches and helping Spurs negotiate the group phase.

"Manchester United will activate a one-year extension of Michael Carrick’s £130,000-a-week contract to keep the midfielder at Old Trafford beyond the summer. Carrick agreed to the clause when he signed a two-year deal in 2013 and has expressed a wish to stay. The midfielder, 33, has been one of their most influential players since his return from injury and it has coincided with an upturn in fortunes for the club. Michael Carrick's excellent form for Manchester United this season will be rewarded with a new contract .

Manager Louis van Gaal wants to keep Carrick at Old Trafford and United will confirm their plans in talks early in the new year. Carrick has become one of the most important players during United’s climb into third place in the Premier League and Van Gaal is a big admirer of his qualities. Carrick also forced his way back into the England team this year. He has won five Premier League titles since his move from Tottenham in 2006 and was United’s player of the year in 2013.

They are expected to sideline the former Everton player until after the FA Cup third-round tie at Yeovil a week tomorrow. Van Gaal had better injury news about other players.

"Harry Kane is confident Tottenham Hotspur can reverse their dreadful form against the ‘big clubs’, starting with back-to-back matches against Manchester United and Chelsea. Kane, who scored his 15th goal of the season against Leicester on Boxing Day, claims Mauricio Pochettino has given his side the belief they can mix it with the best. ‘Previously we were beaten mentally before we stepped out on the pitch because we were up against a bigger named team,’ said Kane. ‘That isn’t the case anymore.’ Harry Kane silences the crowd after putting Tottenham a goal up inside the first minute at Leicester . Kane blasts home his 15th goal of the season as Spurs ran out 2-1 winners at the King Power Stadium . Since the start of 2012 Tottenham have played 26 games against Chelsea, Manchester City, Liverpool and Arsenal, the teams that finished in the top four last season, and have lost 18. This includes heavy defeats to Liverpool, Manchester City and Chelsea this campaign. But striker Kane insists that Spurs’ run of four victories in a row has led to a surge of positivity in the dressing room. ‘We need to go into these games believing we can win,’ said Kane. ‘We haven’t done it in the past few years. It is something that has to change and I think it already is. Kane says manager Mauricio Pochettino has given Spurs the belief they can beat the big teams .

Steven Gerrard scored a penalty as Liverpool won 3-0 at White Hart Lane earlier in the campaign . ‘We’re confident at the moment. These are going to be tough games but we’re ready for it and going for three points. Mauricio has built confidence and belief. ‘The lads have taken to his philosophy well and there are no better games to show that than big games at home.’ Spurs have been incredibly poor defensively against the big clubs, conceding 72 goals in those 26 fixtures. ‘The defensive line is important,’ said Pochettino. ‘We hope we can fix this problem.’ Hugo Lloris who, along with David de Gea, has been the Premier League’s outstanding keeper this season, made two crucial saves against Leicester. ‘He’s one of the best keepers in the world, without a doubt,’ said Kane. ‘You don’t become France keeper and captain without being the very best. He definitely saved us against Leicester and in other games. I’m happy to have him behind us.’ Kane was full of praise for Spurs goalkeeper Hugo Lloris, seen here making a save at Leicester on Friday .","Harry Kane insists Tottenham are no longer frightened of 'big clubs'

"Stoke City boss Mark Hughes feels Bojan Krkic has answered any doubts over whether he can cope with the grittier side of life as a Barclays Premier League footballer. Bojan arrived in the English game over the summer with a reputation as a player of undoubted talent but also with question marks hanging over him. Certainly, there was plenty of interest in seeing how the little forward - a product of the Barcelona academy who has also played for Roma, AC Milan and Ajax - would fare having joined the Potters, particularly on  the less glamorous occasions. Bojan Krkic celebrates his goal that saw Stoke City beat Everton 1-0 on Boxing Day at a rainy Goodison Park . Bojan, though, is emerging as a key man for his new side and he produced a typically influential display in Stoke's 1-0 win at Everton on Boxing Day amid bitterly cold, soaking wet conditions. The 24-year-old Spaniard proved the match-winner of a physical contest, earning and then converting a 38th-minute penalty. And Hughes said: 'You saw the determination in Bojan, both in the initial run into the box and then to grab the ball and score the penalty. 'The Everton game was a new experience once again for him and I think he is really enjoying what is happening with his football. 'It was a cold, wet day, but all that is an old cliche. Mark Hughes insisted that Bojan has proven he is able to perform even on a cold and wet day . 'It is something where if people see any weakness in Bojan's play or attitude to hard work, they will say he is not quite right for the English game. 'I think in the short space of time he has been here, he has knocked all those thoughts on the head because he has come in and shown he is an exceptional professional. He works really hard every day to get better and stronger.' Eleventh-placed Stoke's next match is a home clash with West Brom on Sunday and Hughes is hopeful Bojan, who came off in the second half against Everton due to a back problem, will be available. A head injury sustained by Ryan Shawcross in that game should not stop him from being involved, but Phil Bardsley is a doubt because of the ankle issue that ruled him out of playing at Goodison Park, and Stephen Ireland (knee) looks set to be absent again. A green light is clearly shone on Bojan as he scores the decisive penalty against Everton . The Potters - now with 51 points for 2014, their best haul for a calendar year since their promotion to the Premier League in 2008 - head into the fixture against 15th-placed West Brom still looking to record back-to-back top-flight victories for the first time this term. Hughes' men have pulled off some impressive triumphs, beating the likes of Manchester City, Arsenal and Tottenham, but struggled each time to then build upon the result. The Welshman is optimistic that might change following the Everton contest as his side prepare to host an Albion outfit that have only one win in their last eight league games. 'We have found it difficult to get back-to-back results - that is something that has stalled our season on occasions,' Hughes said. 'We have had really good performances, then stumbled in the next game. So hopefully that won't be the case this time. 'It is difficult for everyone with the quick turnaround, a little bit unfair on everybody really. But we'll make the best of it - we pride ourselves on our fitness levels.' The Stoke City manager has been impressed with how the Spaniard has coped with the physicality in England . Meanwhile, Stoke midfielder Glenn Whelan says 'anything could happen' with regard to his contract situation. Hughes earlier this month said an offer had been made to the Republic of Ireland international, whose current Potters deal runs out next summer, before Whelan himself played down the idea of formal talks having happened. The 30-year-old player has also said he would like to spend the rest of his career at Stoke. And, speaking to the club's website, Whelan said: 'There's obviously been one or two things said from both sides, but at the moment anything could happen. 'I've got myself back in the team now and my aim is to stay in so I can prove people right and wrong. 'For me personally, I only have five months left and ideally I want to stay here but if not then I'm playing to go somewhere else. 'We will have to see what happens over the coming weeks and months.'","Bojan Krkic moved to Stoke City from Barcelona during the summer .

"West Brom boss Alan Irvine will not shirk the challenge as he searches for the winning formula. Pressure is growing on Irvine, at a club not renowned for its patience, as the Baggies’ poor run of results continued with a 3-1 loss to Manchester City on Boxing Day. Albion have won just one of their last eight Barclays Premier League games and are only two points above the relegation zone ahead of a tricky trip to Stoke on Sunday. West Brom boss Alan Irvine will not shirk the challenge as he searches for the winning formula . Irvine watched on in the snow as his side lost 3-1 to Manchester City on Boxing Day . But Irvine has reasons to be encouraged. His side built up a 2-0 with some impressive attacking play against QPR last weekend - only to capitulate and lose - and individual errors hampered them against City. Irvine said: 'It will be a very tough game at Stoke - it is a hard place to go. They are a team who are capable of causing you a lot of problems. 'But we will do the work we normally do on them and hopefully that will get us a good result. 'They had a good result against Everton and will be feeling good about that, so it is a big challenge - but if we can eradicate the individual errors then when are good enough to cause them problems. 'All I can do is keep trying to do the job in the way I that I do it. I work extremely hard. I try to leave nothing to chance.' Irvine could certainly do little as goalkeeper Ben Foster spilled a deflected Jesus Navas cross to allow Fernando to give City an eighth-minute lead at The Hawthorns on Friday. Five minutes later former City defender Joleon Lescott then felled David Silva for a penalty converted by Yaya Toure. Silva put the result beyond doubt with a well-taken third after Lescott gave the ball away on 34 minutes, but West Brom showed spirit amid a second-half blizzard to create a number of chances. Manchester City midfielder Fernando netted an acrobatic opener after eight minutes against West Brom . Yaya Toure then converted a penalty to make it 2-0 after Silva had been fouled  just five minutes later . David Silva slotted in a third from inside the area just after half an hour . They finally claimed a deserved consolation three minutes from time when England goalkeeper Joe Hart missed a corner in the snow storm and the ball ricocheted into the net. The final touch came off the back of Brown Ideye’s head, giving the Nigerian striker a fortuitous - but much-welcomed - first Premier League goal. Irvine said: 'I challenged them to be strong mentally, to have that toughness and that courage to take the ball and not crumble. 'It is easy to say that and challenge them but they have got to go out and do that and, to be fair, they did.' Midfielder Graham Dorrans could return for Albion at Stoke after illness and a calf strain but striker Victor Anichebe remains on the sidelines. Captain Chris Brunt could come back into the starting line-up after making his comeback from a hamstring injury off the bench.","Alan Irvine will not shirk challenge of finding winning formula at West Brom .

"Alan Irvine is acutely aware that defeat at Stoke City on Sunday would put his position deeper in doubt — but the West Bromwich Albion head coach maintains that a positive result to match their performances is coming. West Brom lost 3-1 to reigning champions Manchester City to leave Irvine conceding that he could ‘not necessarily’ be confident of keeping his job. They have lost six games out of eight and are two points above the relegation places. Chairman Jeremy Peace has shown a decisive touch in the past.

Manchester City midfielder Fernando netted an acrobatic opener after eight minutes against West Brom . ‘I think we have been playing better than the results have shown,’ said Irvine. ‘I’d love to have more points but I don’t think anyone who watches us can feel we’re playing badly. We created a lot of chances.’ Irvine has managed to inspire a result when under pressure this season, but West Brom have a woeful record against Stoke, winning three of their last 34 meetings — losing 21. Cutting out individual errors is crucial — Ben Foster and Joleon Lescott were at fault against City — and having Saido Berahino back firing could prove decisive. The England Under-21 striker has not scored since October but was restored to the starting line-up on Boxing Day and had two good chances that went wide. Saido Berahino looked sharp as he returned to the West Brom line-up for the 3-1 defeat to Manchester City . Yaya Toure converted a penalty to make it 2-0 to City after Silva had been fouled in the box . David Silva slotted home smartly from inside the area just past the half-hour mark as City made it 3-0 . ‘His movement was good and our passing was good to get him in,’ said Irvine. 'He snatched at a few things which you do when you are desperate for a goal. I would expect Saido to score one but he hasn’t been too far away.’ Meanwhile, Stoke midfielder Glenn Whelan admits he is playing for his future. The Republic of Ireland midfielder will be out of contract in the summer but he wants to extend his six-year stay.

Glenn Whelan has admitted he is fighting for his Stoke future after finding first-team action hard to come by . After making his first start in almost three months in the 1-0 win at Everton on Boxing Day, Whelan indicated that he still has to convince the club he is worthy of a new deal. ‘At the moment anything could happen,’ said the 30-year-old. ‘I’ve got myself back in the team now and my aim is to stay in so I can prove people right and wrong. ‘Personally, I only have five months left and ideally I want to stay, but if not I’ll go elsewhere.’","Alan Irvine will not shirk challenge of finding winning formula at West Brom .

"Paul Lambert is convinced Aston Villa’s new swagger and style will keep them away from a relegation battle this season. That view comes in spite of a 1-0 defeat at Swansea City on Boxing Day that left Villa only five points clear of the bottom three. But Lambert believes he has seen enough in the four games since Villa adopted a possession-based game to be sure of survival. There have been signs of encouragement, namely the draw with Manchester United and the fact they dominated possession away against a team like Swansea, but Villa have taken only four points since ditching their counter-attacking, direct style.

They are enjoying having a lot of the ball rather than chasing it. ‘We have found a way that really suits us. There will be so many twists and turns throughout the season but if we keep doing what we’ve been doing we will be fine.’ Lambert added: ‘History tells you in years gone by you have to earn the right to stay in the league regardless of how big your name is or how big the club is. ‘They say get 40 points and see what happens. We have got 20, last year it took us until January time to get 20 so that’s an improvement.’ Lambert issues instructions to forward Gabby Agbonlahor in the defeat to Swansea City .

"Crystal Palace have a wide-ranging list of possible candidates to replace manager Neil Warnock, who was sacked on Saturday. The list includes Derby’s Steve McClaren, ex-Porto boss Vitor Pereira and former Palace players Tony Popovic and Gareth Southgate. However, Tony Pulis, who saved Palace from relegation last season before leaving in acrimonious circumstances on the eve of this campaign, has been effectively ruled out of contention. The Palace board do not envisage being able to work with him and Pulis, himself, says there is ‘no chance’ he will go back.

Warnock, 66, was told that he was being fired yesterday morning, the day after Palace lost 3-1 at home to Southampton and just four months after his second stint as Palace manager began. He became the first Premier League casualty of the season after Palace co-chairman Steve Parish took what he described as the ‘unfortunate decision’ to fire him. Palace have won just once in their last 12 Premier League games and have dropped into the relegation zone, albeit within one point of safety and two wins from mid-table. The fear of Palace falling back into the Championship and off the Premier League gravy train, allied with doubts that Warnock is the right man to spend transfer window funds, underpinned the decision. Neil Warnock was sacked by Palace after just four months in charge . Former Porto boss Vitor Pereira is on the short-list to replace Warnock at Crystal Palace . Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish (right) has made the decision to sack Warnock after a poor start . Keith Millen has taken over as caretaker manager for today’s trip to QPR and could remain in charge for the New Year’s Day visit to Aston Villa. Parish has reportedly already spoken to Pereira, who was considered by Everton as David Moyes’ successor before Roberto Martinez was given the job. The bookmakers’ early favourite for the job was former Spurs manager Tim Sherwood, although he was considered and did not get the post when Palace were looking to replace Pulis.","Neil Warnock was sacked as Crystal Palace manager after four months .

"Steve Bruce insists Hull City must accept they will be one of the teams involved in this season’s relegation scrap. The Tigers enjoyed their first win in 11 at Bruce’s former club Sunderland on Boxing Day to climb out of the drop zone.

Yes, I know that’s quite a statement, but that’s what it means to me. ‘If we turn them over to go nine points clear of them at the halfway stage, it’ s a big turnaround to be caught. ‘As we’ve seen, it’s been difficult enough to win one or two games, let alone turn around a three-game swing.’ He added: ‘We’ve only been in the division a total of four years in our history so we’re going to be in and around it at the bottom.

The teams you think are going to be at the top are there – with one or two surprises like there always is. ‘And I could have called the bottom eight – and we have to accept we are going to be one of them.’ Gaston Ramirez scored his first for the club during the 3-1 win at Sunderland, and Bruce believes only now are they starting to see the best of the Uruguayan playmaker. ‘We got him on loan from Southampton after he went there for £12million and it does take them time,’ he said. 'At Sunderland, he looked a really good player because he’s been given time to adjust to the food, the culture, the cold and the language barrier. We have to let him adjust and find his way.’","Hull City claimed first win in 11 against Sunderland on Boxing Day .

"Bobby Zamora admits the big clubs must be crazy if they’re not considering a swoop for his Queens Park Rangers strike partner Charlie Austin. Austin has 12 goals in 16 games in his first Barclays Premier League campaign and, with the transfer window about to open, Rangers are desperately trying to extend his contract - aware that his goals could be the difference between survival and relegation. ‘As a club, we need to tie him down and get him a new deal,’ said Zamora. ‘Without a doubt other clubs will be looking at him and if they’re not they’re crazy because he can get you that goal. Bobby Zamora appeals for time-wasting from Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny . Charlie Austin celebrates scoring a second-half penalty for QPR at Arsenal on Boxing Day Friday . Austin (centre) tries to dribble past Rosicky (left), as Rangers fell to a ninth straight Premier League win . ‘He did well for us last year and even though it’s been a step up we know what he can do. 'He wasn’t scoring wonder-goals, going past four or five people; they’re striker’s goals, finisher’s goals and if you’ve got that ability, you can do it at any level.’ Like Austin, Zamora took the scenic route from non-League to the top flight. ‘It’s a great route and a great story,’ added the 33-year-old. ‘It gives you extra hunger. It’s brilliant and I’m pleased for him.’ Austin scored a hat-trick as QPR beat West Brom 3-2 in their last Premier League home game . Austin pictured playing for former club Poole Town in Dorset during the 2008-09 season . All but two of Austin’s goals this season have come at Loftus Road, where Rangers return to take on Crystal Palace today. Without a point in nine away games, it will be vital for Harry Redknapp’s team to continue winning at home. ‘Maybe it’s a psychological problem for everyone that comes to our place,’ said Zamora, reversing the idea of a mental block. Managerless Crystal Palace will have to be wary of QPR's in-form striker Charlie Austin on Sunday . ‘We’ve got a good record and it’s not a nice place to come really is it, in terms of the changing rooms and how close the crowd are. ‘We know it will change away from home at some stage.’ Sunday's game against Palace is another crucial fixture for both teams and Redknapp’s team selection on Boxing Day for the 2-1 defeat at Arsenal had this game in mind. ‘One or two can’t play two in three days,’ said the QPR boss, citing Zamora, who came on as a substitute at the Emirates Stadium, and his 30-something defenders Richard Dunne and Clint Hill, who should return.

"Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard will miss the next five to six weeks with a calf injury, manager Roberto Martinez has said. The American missed Sunday's loss at Newcastle with the injury suffered against Stoke on Boxing Day, and is now set to miss out until well into 2015. 'Tim Howard will be out between five and six weeks with a calf injury,' Martinez said at his press conference ahead of the New Year's Day game against Hull. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Everton keeper Tim Howard is expected to be ruled out for between five and six weeks . Everton keeper Tim Howard suffered a calf injury during the 1-0 defeat by Stoke . Martinez said Howard's injury was unsual and admitted that it was a big blow to lose a player of his experience. 'He's picked up a calf injury in his left calf and that's something that as a goalkeeper is really unusual. It happened just kicking the ball against Stoke. 'Tim is going to be a huge miss, not just on the pitch but being around the place and having the calmness that he gives to the younger players and the know how that he brings to the dressing room. 'Tim is a big game player. When he plays for the national team in tournaments and when he plays for us he's used to that scrutiny and responsibility and he just embraces it. The US international fails to save Bojan Krkic's shot during the Boxing Day game at Goodison Park . Joel Robles (right) will continue to deputise between the sticks in Howard's absence . 'That's something that we need to have spread out throughout the squad. We need that big game, big team mentality and (to) cope with the expectations and whatever surrounds the performance.' Joel Robles, who was with Martinez at Wigan, is deputising and, while the Toffees boss is happy with him, he may look to bring in another stopper. 'I thought Joel was very calm against Stoke and did well against Newcastle. But we will assess whether we need cover,' the Spaniard added.","Tim Howard inured his calf during Everton's 1-0 defeat by Stoke City .

"Everton need to stop trying to play like Barcelona and return to what they had under David Moyes, according to Sky Sports pundit Graeme Souness. The Toffee's defensive frailties were once again exposed during their 3-2 defeat by Newcastle on Sunday - meaning only QPR have conceded more goals than Roberto Martinez's side this season. Speaking after the game, Souness said: 'Everton are flattering to deceive at the moment. Roberto Martinez needs to change his style to arrest Everton's slump, says Graeme Souness . The Sky presenter claims Everton need to get back to playing David Moyes' direct style of football . 'The second goal typifies Everton at the moment, they are trying to play their way out of trouble when there's nothing wrong with putting your foot through it occasionally. 'They're trying to basically play like Barcelona at their best, but there's very few teams out there that can keep the ball when teams come after them big style. 'It's not all pass-pass-pass, sometime you have to mix it up at times.' The former Liverpool midfielder even went as far as to say that Martinez should consider sacrificing his expansive style in favour of the more direct approach that identified the club under previous manager David Moyes. 'You have to get back to what David Moyes had. They were a little bit more in your face, more direct and they mixed it up a little bit. 'Now, they are so predictable to play against and that's why they're conceding so many goals as well.' Papiss Cisse celebrates scoring to level Arouna Kone's opening goal at St James' Park . Ayoz Perez (centre) adopts an Alan Shearer goal celebration after giving Newcastle a first half lead . Jack Colback (left) watches the ball cross Joel Robles goalline for what was eventually the winner . Fellow pundit Gary Neville agreed that Martinez's philosophy of playing the ball out from the back is contributing to their woeful defensive record this season. 'Everton were beaten in every single department and the goals that they conceded were a result of play that Roberto Martinez tries to promote. 'Obviously playing out from the back, which is fine - but they have overplayed and it has cost them. 'But if that is the way that you promote to play then you have to lie and die by that. Alan pardew (left) consoles Martinez, but the Spanish manager insists he won't change his philosophy . However, the Spanish manager was defiant that he would persevere with the same tactics that led Everton to a praiseworthy fifth placed finish last season. Speaking to reporters, he said: 'As a team we need to stick with our principles, the doubts that people try to bring in makes you a stronger team. We showed last season what we could do, we haven't lost that talent, if anything we've increased it.'","Everton were defeated 3-2 by Newcastle in the Premier League on Sunday .

"Newcastle United manager Alan Pardew says £1.5million bargain-buy striker Ayoze Perez has more natural technical ability than his former players Carlos Tevez, Teddy Sheringham and Dean Ashton. Perez, 21, has already scored four goals in his debut season in England after signing from Spanish Second Division club Tenerife. The Spaniard is expected to lead the line against Everton on Sunday after catching the eye of Sir Alex Ferguson against Manchester United on Boxing Day, and Pardew, who had some great attacking talent at his disposal at West Ham, predicts a glittering future for the Spaniard. Ayoze Perez carried a threat for Newcastle United in their Boxing Day defeat at Man United . Sir Alex Ferguson, the former Man United manager, was impressed by Perez's performance at Old Trafford . Newcastle (4-2-3-1): Alnwick; Janmaat, S Taylor, Coloccini, Dummett; Colback, Tiote; Gouffran, Sissoko, Ameobi; Perez . ‘He has surprised me at how good he has been. He is a real talent,’ said Pardew. ‘I have been fortunate to work with some really good strikers. I think of Tevez, Sheringham, Dean Ashton, and he has got faster feet than all three of them. ‘And the work ethic he has put in for the team as well, if he progresses like he is, we don’t know where he’ll end up. ‘I was lucky enough to have a quick glass of wine with Sir Alex [on Boxing Day] and he caught his eye.’ Newcastle manager Alan Pardew commended the work ethic and pace of Spain Under 21 star Perez . Pardew will want to arrest a run of four successive defeats when Everton visit St James' on Sunday . The comparison with Tevez is a real boost to Perez given that the Argentine forward has played for some of the biggest clubs in Europe including Manchester United, Manchester City and Juventus, and scored for his country at the World Cup. Barcelona and Real Madrid had been interested in signing the Spain Under-21 forward before Newcastle moved to bring him to Tyneside last June. And Pardew reflected: ‘He won player of the year last season in the Spanish Second Division, so it’s not a complete mystery. ‘But we worked hard on his signature and worked hard on his family to give him the platform that we would give him an opportunity. Perez rues a missed opportunity during last weekend's Tyne-Wear derby defeat to Sunderland . Newcastle's teenage striker Adam Armstrong (right) tussles with Man United defender Paddy McNair . ‘We put a lot of physical work into him. It’s not bulk he needs, because agility is a massive part of his game, it’s just body strength and he has that,’ said Pardew. Pardew is also cheered by the emergence of Newcastle’s academy players Paul Dummett, Rolando Aarons and Adam Armstrong, the 17-year-old who started his first top-flight match on Boxing Day. The Newcastle boss added: ‘I genuinely think that with Dummett, Aarons, Armstrong and Perez, we have four really outstanding young players and that is very, very difficult to get through at a Premier League club.’","Ayoze Perez was impressive for Newcastle in Man United defeat .

"These extraordinary photographs document the fascinating lives of a teen gang living in Brooklyn, New York, in the 1950s. The images are part of a collection called Brooklyn Gang, and were taken by renowned photographer Bruce Davidson, 80, who has dedicated his career to documenting New York City life and culture. This collection is especially interesting as it follows a group of teens, who called themselves the Jokers, who lived in the city in 1959. Gangs of New York: This collection details the lives of a teen gang - who called themselves The Jokers - living in Brooklyn, New York, in the 1950s . In it together: The gang, photographed by the legendary artist Bruce Davidson, pose outside a diner in downtown Brooklyn circa 1959 . Young love: One of the gang's couples get amorous on a beach. The photographer was inspired to capture the gang's lives after hearing about fights in the city . When the photographer was 25, he read about a series of fights breaking out in one of the city's open spaces - Prospect Park. It is thought there were around 1,000 gang members living in New York in the fifties and intrigued, Mr Davidson went to Brooklyn in search of some insight. Before long, he found these teens who befriended him, allowing him to take photographs of their fascinating lives. In the images, the group can be seen hanging out in various locations around the city - including diners, down street alleys and in sun-ridden parks. Concrete jungle: One of the gang members swings on a pipe down a city alley way. In 1959, there were around 1,000 gang members in New York . Cool characters: A gang member chats while leaning against a juke box. The artist said he really got to know each member well over the months they worked together . Killing time: The friends hang out in a park while one girl - around 15 years old - fixes her hair and smokes a cigarette . Sometimes, the male gang members are joined by females, with several of the shots depicting scenes of amorous young love. The images also give an insight into . the fashions of the time - with the gang members all dressed in classic . fifties attire including collared shirts. The males all support quiffs, while the females have a selection of up-dos. Writing in the afterword of the collection, Mr Davidson said: 'I met a group of teenagers called the Jokers. 'I was 25 and they were about 16. I could easily have been taken for one of them.' 'In time they allowed me to witness their fear, depression and anger. Teen obsession: A young couple kiss on the back seat of a car as it rattles down a high way on the outskirts of the city . Boys in the neighborhood: Two young men lean against a tree and between photographer Bruce Davidson . Brothers in arms: Two friends and members of the Jokers smile as they lift their shirt sleeves to reveal their tattoos . 'I soon realised that I, too, was . feeling their pain. In staying close to them, I uncovered my own . feelings of failure, frustration and rage.' However, the story does not stop there. In 1998 when a publisher had approached the photographer about his collection, Bobby Powers - the once leader of the gang got in touch with the family. Over a period of ten years, the photographer's wife Emily spoke with My Powers, speaking with him about his struggle to overcome his drug infested, violent past. Mrs Davidson wrote a book - called Bobby's Book - about the tales Mr Powers told, following his fascinating life from member of a gang to drug addiction counselor. Talking the talk: Three men sitting on a subway train look to be deep in conversation.

"All being well, Alan Pardew will return to the scene of his greatest playing triumph on Thursday. This time, he is the manager. At Villa Park in 1990, wearing the red and blue striped shirt of Crystal Palace, he scored the dramatic extra-time winner in the FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool. Credit to Pardew because he intends to take the team against Aston Villa provided the announcement confirming that he is the new Palace manager is made today. That is certainly the intention. Alan Pardew is hoping to take charge of Crystal Palace for their New Year's Day match against Aston Villa . Pardew back in his playing days scored a memorable winner over Liverpool in the FA Cup back in 1990 . Pardew played more than 100 games for Palace during a four-year spell at the south London club . Cheick Tiote (left) and Papiss Cisse leave Newcastle's training ground after Pardew returned to say goodbye . Newcastle captain Fabricio Coloccini arrives at training, while Peter Beardsley (right) gives a thumbs up . Pardew made 128 league appearances between 1987 and 1991, scoring eight goals. The highlight of his time at Selhurst Park, however, was the FA Cup run in the 1989-90 season. Pardew was one of the 'Fab Four' (with Mark Bright, Gary O'Reilly and Andy Gray) and scored the winner against Liverpool in that memorable 4-3 semi-final victory at Villa Park (the other three also netted in that match). The Eagles pushed Manchester United all the way in the Wembley final, drawing 3-3 in the first match, but lost 1-0 in the replay. Pardew played every minute of both matches. It would be easy to swerve this one, to sit in the stand alongside co-chairman Steve Parish and club ambassador Mark Bright. Instead he intends to be there for the game, most likely in the dug-out for the first of 19 matches that will decide whether Palace stay in the Barclays Premier League. Good on Pardew for that. He takes over a team who need organisation, focus and discipline after Neil Warnock was sacked following the 3-1 defeat at home by Southampton on Boxing Day. On Tuesday, Warnock gave his first interview since leaving Selhurst Park and he couldn’t resist throwing a few grenades at Parish. ‘I would have liked the chairman to tell me they had a chance of getting Alan Pardew and would I mind stepping down,’ he told talkSPORT. ‘When I was clearing my desk, Ronnie Jepson said “Gaffer, they’ve got someone else”.’ Pardew will acquire a leader in the form of Mile Jedinak, but the club captain will be away for a month at the Asia Cup with Australia . Keith Millen was in charge on Sunday as Crystal Palace drew 0-0 against QPR at Loftus Road . His assistant called that right. Pardew was always Plan A, the man Parish wanted when Tony Pulis walked away two days before the opening game of the season. At the time, the former Palace man wasn’t ready. On this occasion he is and his brief, beyond survival, is to build a team who can compete in the top half of the Premier League. In an interview given by Parish last week, the ambitious Palace co-chairman admitted that he craved a run in one of the cup competitions. Palace will turn their attention to the FA Cup on Sunday when they go to Dover in the third round, but the priority remains the Premier League. All was quiet at Crystal Palace's Beckenham training on Tuesday, with no Pardew announcement imminent . The circumstances will be very different at Palace, where the stadium has changed little since Pardew (below) left for Charlton in November 1991. Back then the team trained at the Imperial Sports Ground in Mitcham, and they have conducted a tour of south London in the intervening years before ending up in Beckenham. On Tuesday Warnock complained about the infrastructure at the club and claimed the training ground was not the right standard for a Premier League team. It has been interpreted at Selhurst Park as a bit of bitching, particularly after he claimed he took over a club in chaos. Last season Palace finished 11th, which Warnock insists was ‘lucky’. In the dressing room, Pardew will acquire a leader in the form of Mile Jedinak, but the club captain will be away for a month at the Asia Cup with Australia. Now Neil Warnock has departed, Pardew (left) will take the reins at Selhurst Park - his old club . Steve Parish made a bold move by sacking Warnock after four months, and has appointed Pardew instead . Pardew will also have his work cut out rebuilding the shattered confidence of Palace’s forward line after Warnock’s criticism of them in recent weeks. Fraizer Campbell has not recovered from his miss against Manchester United in November and Dwight Gayle, the best finisher at the club, is in need of direction. There will be money to spend in the transfer window and the club have already spoken to Pardew about potential targets. At Selhurst Park he will have a greater say in recruitment, a refreshing change from the limitations of working for Newcastle owner Mike Ashley. By hiring Pardew, Parish has overlooked his man’s disappointing spell as manager of Charlton in 2006. He could not halt the slide and they fell out of the Premier League after winning only five games with him in charge. At Palace, he will need to win a few more than that. Warnock gave his first interview since leaving Selhurst Park and couldn’t resist throwing a few jibes at Parish .","Alan Pardew wants to lead Crystal Palace out against Aston Villa on New Year's Day .

But disaster strikes when the unnamed member of the London Central Fellowship Band gets ambitious - and decides he can persevere despite feeling the need to sneeze. And, thinking he can hold it in, the musician powers through - momentarily at least. Unfortunately, his ambition gets him nowhere - and he sneezes into his instrument, making a loud trumping noise mid-way through the rendition. Ever professional, the band continue without falling about laughing. The man sneezed into his instrument, making a loud trumping noise in the middle of the performance . In fact, the conductor barely seems to notice - carrying on without batting and eyelid. A video-friendly member of the audience who taped the concert decided to upload the hilarious footage onto YouTube. It has now been watched over 650,000 times. One YouTube user noted the man's sneeze sounded rather like an elephant. Another, who goes by the name Dieselboy914, expressed sympathy - writing: ‘I play trombone, and this has happened to me, too. 'It’s almost unavoidable, you never feel it coming.’ Even the London Symphony Orchestra has commented, adding: ' We've all been there: it's a quiet passage and you really really need to sneeze. The video has gone viral - with some internet pranksters using the footage to make a variety of comical films, including this one featuring a startled baby elephant . 'Try to ignore and keep playing, or disrupt the music to stop and sneeze? This is what happens when you don't quite make it...﻿' Unfortunately for the red-faced trombone player, the embarrassment doesn't stop there. Now, internet pranksters have taken it upon themselves to make parody videos of the mortifying accident. Perhaps taking note of the YouTube user's elephant comparison, one video features a pack of the animals walking together. And when a baby elephant is startled the man's sneeze replaces what one can assume was the sound of the animal making a trumping noise.","Member of London Central Fellowship Band feels need to sneeze .

"The weekend’s games were pleasantly free of grappling in the box. Referees didn’t appear to have changed their approach, but players seem to have taken heed of our ‘Hands Off In The Box’ campaign. I understand some managers have warned players of the consequences of grappling. Not all matches were incident-free — as we report here — but there were encouraging signs. Stephen Ward (Burnley vs Arsenal) Burnley often had nine or 10 in the penalty box and that occasionally resulted in argy bargy. Stephen Ward had his hands wrapped around the waist of Calum Chambers a few times at set pieces. Ward and Dean Marney were both pulling on Chambers’ shirt at a corner in the 72nd minute. Chambers broke away to poke home his debut Arsenal goal. ----------------------------------------------------------- .

"Tony Pulis is on the brink of becoming West Bromwich Albion manager after rejecting Newcastle United. The former Stoke boss, who quit Crystal Palace on the eve of the season, is clear to work again from January 1 under his severance deal with the south London club. He had been interested in the vacancy at Newcastle but told his advisers to end talks when they became worried that controversial club owner Mike Ashley and head scout Graham Carr would want a say in team selection. Tony Pulis is set to take over at West Brom after turning down the job at Newcastle United . Pulis has been out of work since leaving Crystal Palace before the start of the Premier League season . Ashley and Carr control the recruitment of players at St James’ Park, a situation Alan Pardew reluctantly accepted. But it was a factor in Pardew’s decision to accept an offer to become Palace’s new manager. Pulis, 56, was not prepared to accept that. Newcastle were unavailable for comment. Indeed, Pulis insisted he would only succeed sacked head coach Alan Irvine at The Hawthorns if it was written into his contract that he would be in charge of transfers. Last season’s LMA Manager Of The Year is expected to be in charge for Saturday’s FA Cup third-round tie against non-League Gateshead. Having rejected Newcastle, a lawyer and an agent representing Pulis opened discussions with West Brom. But Pulis had given them strict instructions not to agree to a position that fitted into the current management structure of the struggling Premier League club. Alan Pardew is set to take over at Crystal Palace after deciding to leave Newcastle . Pulis had no interest in allowing a technical director to recruit his players when he prefers to trust his own judgment. It was over recruitment that he parted company with Palace in the summer and he was not prepared to compromise. It meant West Bromwich owner and chairman Jeremy Peace, who had also approached Tim Sherwood, had to rethink a structure that has Terry Burton as technical director and Richard Garlick as sporting director. Burton is essentially head of recruitment. Pulis will be joined by his former Stoke and Palace assistant David Kemp. The appointment of Pulis suggests that Peace is ready to accept the terms of a more traditional manager. He had little choice, given the difficulties West Brom have endured since losing Roy Hodgson and Dan Ashworth to the FA. Pulis will become the fourth boss at The Hawthorns in a year after Steve Clarke, Pepe Mel and Irvine. Pulis is set to replace Alan Irvine who was sacked by the Baggies late on Monday night .","Tony Pulis is on the brink of being named as West Brom's new boss .

"West Ham manager Sam Allardyce remains positive ahead of the New Year's Day clash with West Brom despite his side having lost their last two Premier League matches. The Hammers have unexpectedly been challenging for European places following a sensational start to the season that has seen them collect 31 points and stand sixth in the table at the end of 2014. Consecutive defeats by Chelsea and Arsenal suggest West Ham are short of the main challengers for Champions League qualification, although Allardyce insists those results have not affected team morale.

Enner Valencia (centre) attempts an overhead kick during the Hammers' 2-1 defeat by Arsenal . Andy Carroll (centre) and Branislav Ivanovic argue during West Ham's 2-0 loss to leaders Chelsea . Statistics from West Ham's 2-1 defeat by Arsenal prove that Allardyce is right to take heart from his team's performance. The Hammers made a total of 385 passes compared to Arsenal's 294. West Ham had 57.8% possession against an Arsenal side renowned for keeping the ball. Their passing accuracy of 76.1% was more impressive than Arsenal's 66.3% - while their passing accuracy of 60.9% in the opposition half was also greater than Arsenal's 54.5%. West Ham hit 41 crosses compared to Arsenal's 17. CLICK HERE for more stats from our brilliant Match Zone . 'We need to make sure we're spot on and ensure there's no hangover from the two defeats,' he said. 'We've taken a lot of positives out of the Arsenal game because it's the first time we've ever out passed Arsenal. 'We'll take some confidence out of that and hopefully get onto the winning trail against West Brom.' The Baggies will arrive at Upton Park without a manager after Alan Irvine was sacked following a dismal run of results, but Allardyce is purely focused on his own side's performance. 'For us it's about trying to re-establish our home results - whatever position West Brom are in, they're still a talented side,' he said. 'Injuries seem to be at a minimum which is good for us. James Tomkins is unfortunately suspended though. James Collins will come in and we also have Carl Jenkinson available again.' Allardyce insists his side can take confidence from the Arsenal defeat after outpassing their opponents . Alan Irvine ran out of time after a dreadful run of results saw him sacked as West Brom manager . This time last year, there were calls from West Ham fans for Allardyce to be sacked and the durable manager is delighted at having turned things around. 'As a year, 2014 has brought us 56 points and that is a magnificent year,' he smiled. 'We came out of the dark side of January and since then we've had one magnificent year - from the football side and the financial side, too'.","West Ham are preparing to face West Brom in the Premier League .

"Wojciech Szczesny refuses to abandon Arsenal's title hopes after spirits were lifted at the Emirates Stadium by a Christmas revival. Szczesny revealed how Arsene Wenger's team had trained their focus on a short-term target of nine points from three games in seven days and are two thirds of the way there. Victory at Southampton on Thursday will hoist them above the Saints and into the top four at the start of a month when Mesut Ozil and Aaron Ramsey are expected to be back from injury and the transfer market opens for business. Arsenal keeper Wojciech Szczesny was in fine form as the Gunners beat West Ham 2-1 on Sunday . Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny poses for a photo with his team-mates while on his side's team coach . 'When you start the season you always want to win the championship,' said Szczesny. 'That is the only thought in our heads. But with the position that we' re in, we have to look at short-term goals. 'We said before the run of Christmas games we wanted nine points. We have six so far, so we go to Southampton with confidence to get three points. They won't be short of confidence either after a good result against Chelsea. 'Of course we want to catch up on Chelsea and Manchester City. But for now we have to climb up the table and see if we can put pressure on them.' Szczesny prepares to make a save during the crucial 2-1 win at Upton park on Sunday as Arsenal went fifth . Here is the current top of the Premier League table with Arsenal in fifth place after two consecutive wins . Poland international Szczesny attempts to punch the ball to safety at West Ham during the 2-1 victory . Arsenal have won only nine of their first 19 games and are 13 points adrift of Barclays Premier League leaders Chelsea, but Wenger and his players were encouraged by the spirit on display during the 2-1 win at West Ham on Sunday. 'We had to dig deep against by far the strongest West Ham side I've ever played against,' said Szczesny. 'It was quite ugly in the end but we got through. They put a lot of balls in the box so it has to be ugly. We had to defend and put our bodies on the line. Danny Welbeck scored what turned out to be the winning goal for the Gunners at Upton Park on Sunday . 'The centre-backs headed so many balls and made so many blocks. No-one will give them stick on Match of the Day for that performance and I am happy because they do get criticised sometimes.' Wenger needs defensive reinforcements and is planning a January swoop for West Ham's Winston Reid, who is soon out of contract, but much of Arsenal's solidity depends on Laurent Koscielny, who was back alongside Per Mertesacker for the game at Upton Park. 'He is as good as you're going to get in England,' said Szczesny. 'When he is fit and plays with Per, they make a great couple of the centre backs. Having them together is great for us. Hopefully he can continue to play and to be clear of injury.'","Arsene Wenger's side are fifth in the league, 13 points behind Chelsea .

"A planning lawyer and self-styled 'mosque buster' claims he is fighting to stop the 'tide of Islam' by successfully blocking plans for the building of mosques across the UK. Gavin Boby, once linked to the far-right English Defence League, boasts he has already blocked plans for 16 out of 17 mosques being built. Under the banner of the Law and Freedom Foundation, he calls for people to come to him for free professional legal help in opposing mosque proposals and claims that Islam encourages paedophilia, sexual abuse and pimping. Scroll down for video . Gavin Boby, a self-styled 'mosque buster' who boasts that he has blocked plans for mosques being built and should be contacted for free legal advice . He claims to help followers resist planing applications for mosque developments by raising opposition with councils. The 48-year-old says in a video posted online: 'If anyone out there knows of an application for a new mosque, a cultural centre for some phoney community centre or some multi-faith inter-faith harmony institute then let me know.' Mr Boby, from Bristol, runs a planning consultancy but also provides legal assistant for those who oppose mosque developments, according to the Sunday Times. On the foundation website he claims to have stopped the construction of 16 out of 17 mosques in total. These include mosques in York, Blackpool, Bolton, Ealing and one in Kirklees, West Yorkshire, which was to replace 'the beautiful old Jolly Sailor Pub', according to the site. Mr Boby reportedly launched the service with a mock-up of the Ghostbusters logo - swapped for Mosquebusters - in which the ghost was replaced by hate preacher Abu Hamza. Vacancies for volunteers were posted on the EDL website. EDL has since endorsed the Law and Freedom Foundation, saying it is a 'great organisation' on Twitter and referring its followers who have a proposed mosque in their area to Mr Boby. In the website's 'about section' it explains the three threats to the survival of state authority in Britain and Europe. The Law and Freedom website which boasts 16 out of 17 plans to build mosques have been blocked . The third, it reads, is : 'Ethnic division, particularly between Islamic and non-Islamic . society, and the violence at the heart of Islamic doctrine. This is the . most visible problem, and the one that people will blame. 'Political and intellectual elites are undermining law or freedom. So we . need to take what action we can to preserve them ourselves.' Mr Boby has written an online guide that show how local citizens can make a legal case against mosques. In the guide it reads: 'Let councils know that they're on the hook for their decisions. Be relentless. Push.' He also suggests opposing an Islamic centre on the grounds of 'parking congestion', 'disturbance' and 'community relations'. The Jolly Sailor pub in Kirklees, West Yorkshire, which Mr Boby described as 'beautiful' and 'old'. There were proposals to turn the pub in to a mosque but Mr Boby helped block the plans . His advice is rooted in legal arguments, as he continues to suggest emphasising the proposed project will 'cause unacceptable pollution' from traffic and is a hazard to schoolchildren as it will 'bring outsiders with no connection to the area'. He appears to be driven by an apparent ideological hatred of Islam, referring in a video posted on YouTube to recent sex abuse cases, and claims mosques are 'not like churches' and are instead used to instruct followers to commit acts of paedophilia, sexual abuse and pimping. He says: 'Islamic doctrine permits, encourages and to a certain extent mandates Muslim men to take non-Muslim women as slaves to be used for sex. 'In order to stop the Islamic doctrine, which is the root of this problem, you have to prevent further mosques from being built.' Councils contacted by the Sunday Times said Mr Boby had not been instrumental in blocking the development of local mosques. Mr Boby told MailOnline: 'I are (sic) extremely proud that, when these concerned neighbourhoods approach us for help, we enable them to use the laws and consultation procedures that exist for their protection.' A spokesman for the EDL said: 'We support his organisation wholeheartedly and send many people from different communities with different issues concerning mosques in their area.'

"It used to drive Declan Kidney daft when his Ireland squads were dissected along provincial lines - Munster bias was the undercurrent which annoyed him most. Come Joe Schmidt’s ascension to the Ireland throne, the allegations changed from red to blue with the New Zealander’s Leinster connections leaving him open to allegations that he favours his old province. Such mutterings are unfair: Kidney will tell you he picked on form and Schmidt will claim likewise. Yet, despite their natural reservations about the national squad getting analysed along parochial lines, it is still an instructive exercise in the sense that it’s a firm indicator as to how well or not a province is travelling. Munster and Paul O'Connell (centre) are flying high and sit top of the PRO12 after nine games . Same as they are now, Munster, a year ago, were on top of the PRO12 table after nine rounds - but there the similarity between the then and now ends. Back then their players were playing in fits and starts. This inconsistency shackled their European performances in defeat to Edinburgh and in fortunate victory over Gloucester and the price paid was having just a meagre total of four players capped by an unimpressed Schmidt in the November 2013 Guinness series. That selection pattern followed through into the Six Nations, Ireland clinching the title in Paris with a 23-man squad featuring just three Munster players. However, turn the dial forward towards the end of 2014 and, with Munster doubling up in Europe against Saracens and Sale following a successful Aviva Stadium raid against Leinster, the representative rewards were bountiful last month. Ten Munster players were capped during the recent three-game Test series, eight as starters, and further evidence of their growing influence on the national team was evident in how eight of their players featured in the 23 chosen against Australia in the series finale. That generous representation means they are already a year ahead of the objective stated in the strategic plan launched last May where the hope was to provide 30 per cent or more to any Irish national team by 2015/16. Anthony Foley has led Munster well and they are a year ahead of schedule in their development . Eight in 23 is effectively 35 per cent, and while that had the consequence of seeing more players away from Munster at a time in the season when they were plotting for the 10-match winter window that will decide their European fate and see their top spot in the league come under pressure (the sequence started in Wales the night before Ireland beat Australia), coach Anthony Foley (right) isn’t overly concerned by the increased demands. ‘I’m not complaining,’ he says. ‘If you are supplying those players they are obviously playing well. We are obviously doing well in competitions so it’s important to keep that going to try and kick on and get a couple of more in there (in the national set-up) without shooting ourselves in the foot altogether. ‘It’s important for us and important for the Munster psyche that we supply players to the national side and that the national side is successful.’ Skipper Peter O’Mahony believes the increased representation has had an uplifting effect on provincial squad morale, adding that the Test exposure enjoyed by so many more of his colleagues this time round is primed to stand them in good stead as they prepare to face Clermont twice in the space of eight days, starting on Saturday in Limerick. ‘It’s a huge help coming back for guys to be driving standards and for guys to realise what it takes at an international stage,’ he said on the impact of the rise in representation from four to 10. ‘The more people you can have around coming back to the club (from Ireland duty) the better, so it was great to have more guys involved and hopefully we can keep driving that on. ‘It’s the closest thing you’re going to get to it,’ he added on how useful that greater Test exposure will be in helping Munster cope with the Clermont threat. ‘They’re similar. French teams coming over here for back-to-back games... it doesn’t get any bigger really.’ Munster race a tough test when they travel to Clermont in the European Rugby Champions Cup on Saturday . The last time O’Mahony grappled with a French outfit in Limerick, he was gone midway through the opening half. A lineout steal against Toulouse back in April didn’t end happily, the back row dislocating his shoulder. However, while he also went on to have his other shoulder operated on during his lengthy lay-off, he insists there has been no worrying reaction during his two-month-old comeback. ‘No, I’m feeling great, starting to feel normal and fit again. It’s great to get a couple of 80 minutes under the belt at high intensity like that against South Africa and Australia. Great just to get the fitness aspect of it done and feel good again.’ Munster’s feel-good factor has its genesis in a seven-game winning streak that started with the early October win at Leinster, which was O’Mahony’s first outing since his operations. He’s delighted with the consistency in results but, recognising his side has enjoyed some lucky breaks — such as Ian Humphreys’ late missed conversion that would have won last Friday’s league game for Ulster — he knows they must do better heading into Saturday’s showdown with Clermont. ‘That [winning close games recently] will give us a certain amount of confidence, but we haven’t been overly happy with some of the performances. ‘It is a confidence boost to come out of those scrappy ones with the points but, as I said, we have plenty to work on and plenty to nail off this week. ‘When it comes to Clermont we have to be better all over the park. They’re just such a dangerous side coming out of their 22 on a counter-attack, you name it. They’ve got guys who can punish you from all areas and we have just got to everything nailed on to be competing with these guys.’ Competing and continuing to impress Schmidt, just like they did leading into the November Test window.","Anthony Foley's Munster sit top of PRO12 table after nine rounds .

"Sale are confident that they can convince Danny Cipriani to agree a new deal as the prospects of the fly-half moving on appear to be receding, at least for now. The 27-year-old England No 10 contender is out of contract at the end of this season and he will be free to officially negotiate with other clubs from January 1. It has long been assumed that he craves a return to his roots in London, but it is understood  Cipriani is happy in Manchester and is keen to stay with the Sharks if they can recruit well to enhance their hopes of becoming play-off challengers in the Aviva Premiership. Danny Cipriani could sign a new deal with Sale Sharks in the coming weeks . The Sale No 10 is preparing to take on Saracens in the European Champions Cup clash on Saturday . Earlier this year he was linked with a return to former club Wasps but that door has now closed. They are preparing for a fresh start in Coventry and Sportsmail has learned that ex-Newcastle stand-off Jimmy Gopperth has agreed a move to the Ricoh Arena next summer from Leinster - coinciding with Jonathan Sexton’s return to Dublin from Racing Metro. While Wasps have relocated to the Midlands, Harlequins remain a prominent fixture in London but they will have former All Blacks fly-half Nick Evans for another season, while Ben Botica is well regarded - and well paid - as his understudy. In time, a switch to The Stoop may be an appealing proposition for Cipriani, but for now Quins’ transfer-market priorities may be in other areas. Cipriani (centre) was dropped from England's squad for the Autumn Internationals . Elsewhere in the South East, Saracens have Owen Farrell as an established, long-term playmaker and London Irish do not have the title-chasing status that Cipriani craves. Gloucester are the other club who have been mentioned as potential suitors, but they have James Hook, while Billy Burns is a rising talent and both Billy Twelvetrees and Greig Laidlaw can operate at No 10. It is understood that, with England selection such a focus for him, Cipriani is not tempted by the notion of moving to France, where he could earn vast sums at a rich Top 14 club. Instead, there is a chance that he may agree a one-year extension at Sale, with a view to considering their signings and outlook after the World Cup, once the market settles down. Ex-Newcastle Falcons fly half Jimmy Gopperth is to join Wasps next season, Sportsmail understands . Cipriani impressed for England during the summer tour of New Zealand and  is looking to force his way back in . Asked about the progress of negotiations, Sale’s director of rugby Steve Diamond said: ‘We’ve had a chat and we’ll be taking the chat further. I’ll go for a beer with him, discuss it and when the time is right he will agree or he won’t agree. It won’t come down to pounds, shillings and pence; it will come down to our ambitions as a club. ‘We’re targeting two or three very good players. Two of them, we are meeting again this week – non-Premiership players. Danny is enjoying himself up here and if I can match his ambition with a couple of signings, I don’t see it as a problem. ‘The hunch at the moment is that he is dead happy here and we’ll carry on the conversation in the next week or so. At the end of the win against Harlequins, the camera zoomed in on Danny and he didn’t look like a lad who is rushing to get to another club.’ Harlequins fly-half Nick Evans is expected to remain at the club for another season . Cipriani insisted that for now, his primary focus is on maintaining his impressive recent form. But when the time comes to make a decision about his future, it will come down to the quest for titles and trophies. ‘There’s no rush for me at the moment,’ he said. ‘You saw last year when there was all the speculation about Freddie (Burns - before move from Gloucester to Leicester) and that was difficult. If the club shows ambition and signs certain players, that’s what I want to see and shows we’re going in the right direction. ‘People all say we are fighting above ourselves, but if we add some class to that then the boys will start believing that top four is realistic. I don’t play rugby to make up the numbers; I want to be in the play-off games, that is my main focus. That is going to help my international ambitions and I’m not going to stop having them. ‘I’m not eager to get a move, I just want to make sure the team shows the right ambition then it is somewhere I would want to stay. You do grow fond of a place, but play-off rugby is what I want to be involved in.’ Owen Farrell is at Saracens so that is not an option for Cipriani in the South East .","Danny Cipriani's current deal at Sale expire at end of the season .

"Referees are not allowed to speak for themselves and they haven’t been since 2007 when they were instructed not to speak to the media despite the educational benefits that communication offers. Now the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) have a credible speaker in their newly appointed technical director Howard Webb. On Monday night, Webb was afforded an opportunity to talk us through how it feels to referee huge games and how difficult some decisions are, particularly in the biggest games. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail Big Match Stats: Aston Villa 1-1 Southampton . Howard Webb (centre) appeared on Sky Sports' Monday Night Football with Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville . He will have known that Sky Sports’ Monday Night Football programme would set him up, show clips to get him to define interpretation of law and then show inconsistencies and yet he didn’t appear wise to this. Initially he wasted the chance to explain just how hard it is and how different it feels to referee the biggest Premier League games by claiming that all games are treated equally. Players will disagree and so do I. Then he went on to clarify how referees view contact by one player to another’s face, or at least above the line of the shirt as invading personal space and unacceptable when supporting the dismissal of Christian Benteke when playing for Aston Villa against Tottenham two weeks ago. Cue the set up and fast forward to Jack Wilshere’s reaction to Marouane Fellaini on Saturday at The Emirates. The Sky production team left the clip frozen on Wilshere with the top of his head pushed into Fellaini’s face with referee Mike Dean looking straight at it from close up. The retired referee is now the technical director at Professional Game Match Officials Limited . Sky host Ed Chamberlin (left) talks to Carragher as Webb and Neville watch on . It had to be a red card from Webb’s definition but instead of explaining how the enormity of the occasion, the desire to get through a massive game without a red card and inevitable controversy which led to Dean’s mistaken tolerance, he chose to defend his former colleague. Surely the right thing to say would have been that Dean was not afforded a slow-motion view or the freeze frame that Webb was left looking at. If he had it would have been a red card. The opportunity to educate and clarify was wasted. But here’s the rub. PGMOL personnel feel duty bound to support their colleagues, their mates. Rather than just clarify and be consistent there is a desire to ‘cover’ for the referee. Clearly it is easier to criticise an assistant who missed a clear offside in the Everton vs West Ham game. Of course working in live TV isn’t easy but well within Webb’s ability if his hands were not tied. I have huge respect for Howard Webb and his refereeing CV; I like Mike Dean and think he is one of the best refs on the current list. However, as an independent voice I have to say that both men erred this weekend and one more understandably than the other. Arsenal's Jack Wilshere was fortunate to escape a red card for this confrontation with Marouane Fellaini . The Belgian is held back by Michael Carrick as Wilshere squares up to him on Saturday .

"Obama communications director Dan Pfeiffer used his official White House Twitter account to recommend a story undermining the anti-Obamacare story of an aging cancer sufferer concerned about her health care . President Obama's top communications strategist sparked outrage on Monday after tweeting a blog entry that belittled a cancer sufferer's concerns about losing her doctor and insurance because of Obamacare. Edie Littlefield Sundby, a California woman with stage-4 gallbladder cancer, wrote a powerful Wall Street Journal op-ed that she will soon lose her medical insurance – and access to her life-saving oncologists – as a direct result of the Affordable Care Act. But Think Progress, a far-left blog, countered with an article claiming that her insurance company, United Healthcare, left her in the lurch because it chose to abandon the individual insurance market for financial reasons. Dan Pfeiffer, the White House communications director, tweeted a link to that story, titled 'The Real Reason That The Cancer Patient Writing In Today’s Wall Street Journal Lost Her Insurance.' The impact on Twitter was both fast and furious, since Pfeiffer's Twitter feed is an 'official' White House account, meaning that it speaks for the administration. Sundby, who has battled her cancer since 2007, had explained that she is 'one of the losers' in the president's signature health insurance overhaul. Cancer specialists at Stanford have 'kept me alive,' she wrote, 'but UCSD has provided emergency and local treatment support during wretched periods of this disease, and it is where my primary-care doctors are.' Both hospitals, and the doctors who practice in them, are covered by her current PPO but Covered . California, the state's Obamacare insurance exchange, doesn't offer a . single plan that both Stanford and UCSD's medical centers will accept. And, citing unfair tax breaks its competitors enjoy, United Healthcare has said it plans to pull out of California's individual insurance market entirely, leaving Sundy with few options. Scroll down for video . Battle: Cancer sufferer Edie Sundby (pictured with her husband Dale) says she is 'one of the losers' from Obamacare as she has lost her healthcare plan and now faces losing her doctors too . Few options: Sundby (taking part in an 800-mile . walk after she was previously cancer-free) must either accept the . government plan and lose her doctors or pay more with an unfamilar . insurance company . 'I am a determined fighter and extremely . lucky,' she writes. 'But this luck may have just run out: My . affordable, lifesaving medical insurance policy has been canceled . effective December 31.' Think Progress argued that United selfishly 'packed . its bags and dumped its beneficiaries because it wants its competitors . to swallow the first wave of sicker enrollees' on the government-run . exchange. Pfeiffer's tweet may have been a small gesture, but it set off a firestorm of responses to the unusual step of a White House communications czar using a partisan blog to fire a rhetorical fusillade against a terminally ill taxpayer. 'Attacking cancer patients. So this is what a complete lack of self-awareness and moral judgement looks like,' tweeted Republican strategist Rick Wilson. Dan Pfeiffer's Twitter feed is an 'official' White House account, giving his tweets extra weight since he's presumed to be speaking for the Obama administration . He sent out this link to a ThinkProgress article to all his followers . World-class care: University of California, San Diego (pictured), where her primary care doctors are based, does not accept the same exchange plan as Stanford University, where her primary oncologist is based . USA Today oped editor David Mastio took issue with that assessment. 'So failure to provide sufficient empathy is an ""attack,""' he tweeted. 'Wait until that standard gets used against the next GOP prez. Yeesh.' Scott Paterno, one of the late Penn State football coach Joe Paterno's sons and a one-time congressional candidate, fired off: '[S]o, the bait and switch from the obvious lie is to ""its all the insurance companies' fault?"" Shocking.' Sundby also focused on that presidential campaign 'lie' in her op-ed. 'What happened to the . president's promise, ""You can keep your health plan""? Or to the promise . that ""You can keep your doctor""?' she wrote. 'Thanks . to the law, I have been forced to give up a world-class health plan. The exchange would force me to give up a world-class physician. Perhaps that's the point.' 'Broken promises': Obama has previously said that people will not lose their healthcare plans or their doctors - but Sundby said that is not the case for her and demands to know why . Wall Street Journal online editorial page editor James Taranto came to Sundby's defense on Monday afternoon, with a biting column titled 'How Low Can They Go?' Pfeiffer (R) is close to Barack Obama, meaning that his tweets provide the impression that he's speaking for the president . He called Pfeiffer a 'fast-talking flack' and Think Progress – the house blog of a group run by former Clinton White House chief of staff John Podesta – 'a leftist propaganda outfit.' Taranto also blamed 'the regulatory structure established by Obama's comprehensive ""reform"",' not avarice on United Healthcare's part, for the company's decision to cancel Sundby's plan. Her op-ed heaped fuel on an Obamacare fire that has seen more than insurance companies cancel the policies of more than 2 million Americans, with more expected by month's end. Sundby added to MailOnline: 'What I would like to see happen as a result of my op-ed is for the American people to insist that the Executive branch and Congress (and even federal employees) all sign up for health insurance on the exchanges. 'That is the right thing to do. And is the surest way to fix any problems with the exchanges and our healthcare system.' Many Americans forced to seek insurance in the Obamacare exchanges have found higher premium rates, along with higher deductible rates and narrowed networks of covered physicians and hospitals. The enrollment process has also been plagued by software and data entry problems, which led Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to offer an apology to a House committee last week. Sebelius called the enrollment software problems a 'debacle' and 'a miserably frustrating experience for way too many Americans.'","Dan Pfeiffer, the top White House communications strategist, tweeted out a liberal organization's hit piece on Edie Sundby's insurance company .

"Sam Allardyce swallowed a second defeat in three days but not without launching a furious attack on referee Neil Swarbrick's decision to rule out an early goal by Alex Song. Allardyce claimed he was 'confused' and 'bewildered' and that West Ham would not have lost if the goal had stood. Song's fifth-minute volley was disallowed because Cheikhou Kouyate and Diafra Sakho were both offside as they leapt out of the way, one jumping to the side and the other allowing the ball through his legs. They were ruled to be interfering with Wojciech Szczesny's line of vision but the West Ham boss claimed this clashed with information given to managers at the start of the season by the referees' ruling body, the PGMOL. VIDEO Scroll down for Sam Allardyce clearly fuming in rant over Song disallowed goal . Alex Song scored against his old club but it was disallowed because Wojciech Szczesny was unsighted . Song complains to Neill Swarbrick who disallowed his goal because of interferences in play . Song lashes a sensational volley from 25 yards into the back of the net but the goal doesn't stand . 'From what they told us, they've got it horribly wrong,' fumed Allardyce. 'You base your opinions on what they tell you. He didn't touch the ball. He wasn't in the eye-line of the keeper. 'Yes, he was offside but we've seen so many of those allowed as goals. I've not seen one 'not given'. 'It's gone through Sakho's legs and he is three yards to the right of Szczesny, so he's not in his eye-line. There are six players obstructing his eyeline. It's come through everyone. 'Neil Swarbrick cannot have a clear view whether Sakho is directly in the keeper's eyeline.' Even Arsene Wenger admitted he was surprised the goal had been ruled out. Song declines celebration against his former club before the referee Neil Swarbrick calls for offside anyway . Sam Allardyce swallowed a second straight defeat but not without launching a furious attack on Swarbrick . Allardyce summoned as evidence Romelu Lukaku's goal for Everton in West Ham's 2-1 defeat at Goodison Park in November. 'If you go back to Everton away you can see why I'm so angry and frustrated,' he went on. 'Lukaku was stood offside even though the ball ricocheted off our player to him, and that was given onside. 'I'm completely confused and bewildered. There are far too many inconsistencies. 'If we'd been allowed that goal, we wouldn't have lost. One-nil up that early would have kicked the lads on and Arsenal would have found life very difficult from then on. Santi Cazorla steps up to take the penalty and makes no mistake to give Arsenal a 1-0 lead . Danny Welbeck can hardly miss from four yards as Arsenal almost immediately double their lead . Cheikhou Kouyate (left) rises high to meet James Tomkins cross and get West Ham back in the match at 2-1 . 'It was a real blow and, sadly, we've ended up losing a game that was probably a great spectacle. It was combination of a couple of bad misses and a very poor decision. Allardyce had no complaints about the penalty given by Swarbrick for a foul by Winston Reid on Santi Cazorla from which Cazorla opened the scoring. Danny Welbeck scored the second and Kouyate pulled one back in the second half. 'Reidy stuck his leg up and he's gone over on it,' said the West Ham manager, but claimed Morgan Amalfitano had been punished for not diving in the penalty area when challenged by Nacho Monreal. 'I just wish Morgan had done similar when he got tugged by Monreal in the last minute. He stayed on his feet. He was being fouled but didn't go down. 'So, there's another scenario for you. Simulation is not nice, but when you don' t get free-kicks for staying on your feet, you're in a difficult situation.'","West Ham lost 2-1 to Arsenal in their Premier League clash .

"Sportsmail's Graham Poll casts his eye over the weekend's controversial moments in the Barclays Premier League to assess whether the match officials made the correct call. Arsenal v Manchester United . If Jack Wilshere was taller he would have head-butted Marouane Fellaini in the face. Instead he got as close as he could, after being incensed for no clear reason, but still should have been dismissed for his petulant act in the clear view of referee Mike Dean. The usually excellent Dean chose to leave Wilshere on which was hard to understand given his clear view of the offence. Arsenal's Jack Wilshere was fortunate to escape a red card for this confrontation with Marouane Fellaini . The Belgian is held back by Michael Carrick as Wilshere squares up to him . Stoke City v Burnley . If Victor Moses was upset when Garry Monk accused him of being a cheat when Swansea played Stoke last month it hasn't affected his conduct. Moses was certainly guilty of a dive in this match when he went over for a penalty which referee Martin Atkinson was well positioned to turn down. The only mystery was why the Leeds-based referee failed to stop play and caution Moses as he should have done. Until referees step up and carry out their duties properly, players will continue to dive and cheat. Victor Moses was guilty of a dive in Stoke's match with Burnley but Martin Atkinson didn't book him . Chelsea v West Brom . Chelsea are the best team in the Premier League by quite some distance this season and certainly don’t need to be helped by poor officiating. Lee Mason was let down badly by his assistant who somehow failed to see that Diego Costa was in an offside position when he scored the Blues' opening goal. However, West Brom can have no complaints about Mason when he rightly dismissed Claudio Yacob for a two-footed jumping tackle on Costa – that type of challenge needs to be stamped out of football. Diego Costa scored Chelsea's opening goal from an offside position in their win over West Brom . Claudio Yacob saw red for this reckless two-footed lunge on Diego Costa . Yacob protests his innocence to referee Lee Mason after being dismissed . Red card? Red face! Referee James Linnington was left red faced when he decided to send Reading’s Alex Pearce off at Cardiff on Friday evening.

"MARGOT AT WAR: LOVE AND BETRAYAL IN DOWNING STREET 1912-16 by Anne de Courcy (Weidenfeld & Nicolson £20 ) August, 1914. As the Great Powers, including Britain, are dragged into war, the atmosphere inside No 10 Downing Street is riven with emotion. Not only, not even mainly, about the war. The Prime Minister, Henry Asquith, is secretly madly in love with a woman less than half his age. Venetia Stanley is the closest friend of his daughter Violet; their letters to each other suggest a wild lesbian affection — ‘my darlingest, how I want you’ — or was it just their way of talking? Violet is also deeply in love with her own father and determined to come between him and her stepmother, his second wife Margot (her own mother died young). The Prime Minister, Henry Asquith, was secretly madly in love with a woman less than half his age, Venetia Stanley . Margot Asquith, the lavish party hostess of No 10, learns of her husband’s infatuation with Venetia and confesses her jealous misery to her confidante, Asquith’s young Private Secretary, Edwin Montagu. She does not realise that Edwin, too, is madly in love with Venetia, who is keeping him dangling. None of these secret couples is able to get into bed together. The atmosphere is electric with frustrated yearnings, to which the onset of the grimmest, greatest war takes second place. As I read on with increasing amazement at these carryings-on, the thought kept intruding: this is a plot that Downton Abbey would die for! Its participants, if not actually titled, are all rich members of the country house party set. Margot Asquith was besieged by admirers of her wit and outrageous outspokenness for years before she married her husband . Margot’s father made his fortune in gold mines. Margot herself, meanwhile, was besieged by admirers of her wit and outrageous outspokenness for years before she married Asquith. He was then a highly successful barrister and rising politician. He was already widowed with five grown-up children and fell for her instantly. S he was certainly no looker. Her face, badly injured in an accident while out hunting, had been left with a sharp, down-turned beak of a nose and the grim mouth of a bird of prey. To counter this she dressed superbly in the fashionably unstructured coats and skirts and extravagant hats of the day. Venetia, her much younger rival, was the daughter of Lord Stanley of Alderley. He had a huge estate in Cheshire, where she kept a menagerie including a bear cub called Lancelot, and she carried her pet monkey Fluto wherever she went. She was described as ‘tall, dark and handsome’, a description that fitted her strong but oddly masculine features. Asquith, with his sharp legal mind, was stocky and always looked serenely imperturbable. Margot’s riches and wild generosity had introduced him to the pleasures of rich food and drink. He liked to have daily luncheon and dinner parties followed invariably by cigars and bridge. As he drank steadily more, his House of Commons nickname was Squiffy. His secret yearning was for sex. Margot, after a series of hard pregnancies and agonising births — only two of their five babies survived — had been told by doctors she must have no more children. Contraception in those days being quite unreliable, she had closed the bedroom door on Asquith — or anyone else. Nevertheless, he wrote frequent letters to assure her of his undying unchanging love. Meanwhile he was pouring out his slavish devotion in daily letters to Venetia: ‘I love you more than I can tell . . . I love you every hour . . . I think of you every hour . . . .you are the pole star of my life . . . my allegiance will never waver.’ As the war drew on he still wanted to tell her everything. ‘The only exciting thing in prospect, other than seeing you on Friday, is what will happen in the Dardanelles next week. This is supposed to be a secret — it is not known to some of the Cabinet’. His indiscretions were mindblowing. Ministers at the Cabinet table grew used to being interrupted by a messenger bearing a letter for Asquith which he would open, peruse and reply to at length. He then sent for the messenger to post it to Venetia. Only then did he resume his part in the decisions affecting the life and death of thousands of men. Venetia was the daughter of Lord Stanley of Alderley . Whatever the war situation, Asquith made time for afternoon rides with Venetia in his chauffeur-driven Napier around the London parks, their knees draped in a motoring rug. Asquith was notorious for giving any passing young woman a pat or a stroke and for taking a good look, if possible, ‘down Pennsylvania Avenue’ — between their breasts. Nowadays he would have been called ‘a groper’, a word not then in use. There is no evidence that he ever got any further, even when both of them were weekending at the same country house. His letters hint at how much more he would have liked to enjoy of her love. But Venetia, in her late 20s, seems to have played a cool hand both with her elderly admirer (Asquith was in his 60s) and her young one, Edwin Montagu. Edwin was extremely rich and Jewish but handicapped by a body of gangling ugliness and ‘a long bony face, pitted like the surface of the moon and sombre unhappy eyes of extraordinary intelligence’. Add to this a fierce moustache and a monocle, and one can imagine why Venetia turned away whenever he tried to embrace her. She found him physically repulsive but intellectually exciting — he was said to be a man ‘whose ugliness was obliterated by his charm’. Asquith made him a minister — unaware that Edwin was beseeching Venetia every week to marry him. At long last she gave way — on conditions. First, that they would have sex only when she chose. Second, that she could have extra-marital affairs. In return she agreed to convert to Judaism — Edwin’s inheritance depended on his not ‘marrying out’. How was she to tell Asquith? And how was he to tell Margot? Both of them had been betrayed, and Venetia knew the Prime Minister would be heartbroken to lose her. ‘Why can’t I marry you and go on making him happy?’ she wrote plaintively to Edwin. ‘I want to be happy and yet not make anyone else unhappy. It’s as tangled as ever . . . Go on loving me. Darling, I think I love you’. A Cabinet plot by Lloyd George, the Chancellor, removed Asquith from the leadership . When she at last tied the knot, her outraged circle assumed she was being converted just for his money — £10,000 a year. Asquith, as she had anticipated, was devastated. The blow came on top of the news that his eldest, most brilliant son, Raymond, had been killed in France. Not even he could remain imperturbably serene. Very soon a Cabinet plot by Lloyd George, the Chancellor, removed him from the leadership. The war was being lost and Asquith was not the man to win it. Lloyd George eagerly replaced him and promptly moved his secretary/mistress, Frances Stevenson, into No 10. Henry Asquith and his long-suffering wife Margot. Much of the book relies on her accounts of the war and the pair's relationship . Anne de Courcy keeps this steaming, erotic merry-go-round whirling with admirable skill. Using Margot’s diaries and a wealth of letters and other sources, she brings those fraught days of war alive, weaving them into their context with an immediacy of unexpected detail. We seem to have been reliving 1914 for months. This book makes you feel you are there watching the tears fall — especially Margot’s — into the emotional cauldron bubbling out of control. When you next look at the door of No 10, still a house of secrets, just imagine what mayhem was going on behind it 100 years ago.","The Prime Minister, Henry Asquith, was secretly madly in love with a woman less than half his age, Venetia Stanley .

"While most of us will happily splash out on a deluxe kitchen or the perfect leather chesterfield, decorating the humble toilet is often overlooked when it comes to home improvements. But if you've been neglecting your loo, then you might be missing a trick as these incredible pictures show. From the toilet that cleans itself to the £3 million bling bog encrusted with jewels, it seems that not everyone is happy with a lick of paint and a porcelain potty when it comes to decorating the lavatory. Among the eye catching examples is a space toilet, complete with a vacuum flush that pulls waste away from the astronaut's body, The intergalactic privy, which is to be found at Tokyo's Engineering Museum of Innovation, also has a royal fan in the shape of the Prince of Wales who inspected it during a visit to Japan in 2008. Bling: This Hong Kong bathroom is made from solid gold and the toilet alone is worth £3million. Visitors have to wear shoe coverings to avoid scratching the golden floor . Handy: The Parisian 'Sanisette' toilet disinfects itself after every use while Monica Bonvinci's effort allows you to poo while enjoying the surrounding view . Although the Far East leads the way when it comes to eye catching toilets, courtesy of one Hong Kong store's £3million gold toilet encrusted with jewels, there are plenty of creative commodes closer to home. Across the Channel in Paris is the Sanisette, a self-cleaning public . restroom. After a patron exits the restroom, a 60-second wash cycle begins inside the toilet, and the toilet fixture itself is . scrubbed and disinfected automatically. In London, the most striking entry into the toilet hall of fame is architect Monica Bonvicini's spectacular creation made from one-way glass which sits outside the Chelsea College of Art and Design. Initially intended for use in prisons, the designer bog lets you take in your surroundings while dealing with your bodily necessities in peace. Another technically advanced throne is the 'Egg Pod' toilet found in the bathroom of London restaurant, Sketch. Guests at the celebrity hangout can climb into little egg shaped capsules in order to complete their business. But though the eggs look high tech, they aren't a patch on the Sega 'Toylets' found in Tokyo. Hidden: Despite the glass walls (and the ability to see out), Bonvinci's bog is made from one way glass which means that passersby definitely (we hope) can't see in . Out of this world: This space toilet, complete with a special vacuum, was seen by Prince Charles during a visit to the Engineering Museum of Innovation in Tokyo . Totally potty! Tokyo's 'Toylets' have pressure sensors at the back which allow users to play urine operated video games while carrying out their personal business . The unusual urinals come complete with games that you play by accurately aiming urine at a pressure sensor located at the back of the urinal. The four games include 'Graffiti Eraser', which enables the toilet goes to use their . stream to erase graffiti on a wall and 'Mannekin Pis' - named for the Brussels landmark - that measures . how much urine has been expelled. In 'The North Wind and the Sun and Me', . the strength of the urine stream produced determines how much a virtual . girl's skirt gets blown up by the wind. Finally, in 'Battle: Milk from . Nose' the user has to try and beat the previous urinator's stream . strength. In addition to its bling bog, Hong Kong also boasts urinals with entertainment included, although the former British colony has chosen not to offer video games, instead plumping for TV shows. Back in Japan, there's also an underwater toilet built into the side of an aquarium in Akashi as well as a toilet that simulates the feeling of taking off from a ski jump at the Madarao-Kogen hotel in Iiyama City. Scary though the ski jump commode might prove for some, nothing is more likely to induce bowel-loosening terror than Mexico's bottomless bathroom. Located at the top of the 15-storey PPDG Penthouse in Guadalajara, the toilet is perched atop an open lift shaft and was built, according to architects Hernandez Silva Arquitectos, with 'concepts of transparency and the simplicity of materials' in mind. Terrifying: Guadalajara's bottomless bog overlooks a 15-storey drop, making Sketch's 'Egg Pod' toilets look positively benign by comparison . Slippery slope: The toilet at the Madarao-Kogen hotel in Japan's Iiyama City makes you feel as if you're atop a mountain and ready to tackle a scary ski jump . High tech: While you can't play games with them, the public urinals in Hong Kong's APM shopping mall do come complete with individual televisions to entertain you .","The Far East has the most creative approach to toilet design, with ski simulators and 'Toylets' among those on offer .
London is home to a spectacular one-way glass toilet, while in Hong Kong, you'll find a throne worth £3million .

"Roberto Martinez deemed Papiss Cisse’s elbow on Seamus Coleman ‘unacceptable’ and stressed the Newcastle United striker deserved to be sent off.

Martinez slammed Cisse for ‘elbowing a fellow professional’ and insisted Newcastle should have been down to 10 men before they made it 1-1 in the 34th minute. Newcastle forward Papiss Cisse (circled) was lucky to stay on the pitch after elbowing Seamus Coleman . That moment proved to be the turning point as moments later Newcastle equalised through Cisse's strike .

"Thanks to burlesque star Dita Von Teese, having a retro cone-shaped embonpoint has never been so cool. But for those with a less than perky pair, achieving a 1940s shape has been a tough task - until now. Hot on the heels of their silhouette-shaping 'drop a dress size' dress, Marks and Spencer has launched the sexy 'Perky Profile' bra to help shoppers get Dita's look for less. It aims to give breasts a retro cone shape thanks to specially constructed padding. Scroll down for video . Perky: The new bra will give you a retro pushed out - as opposed to pushed up - embonpoint . Inspiration: Glamorous burlesque star, Dita Von Teese, is a big fan of autumn's hottest trend - 1940s style . The bra, which is available in Dita esque black and pink, as well as a ladylike cream, will, say M&S, give you a 'push out' rather than a push up profile. Soozie Jenkinson, Head of Lingerie Design at M&S says: 'Modern day celebrities like Dita Von Teese have championed this glamorous retro forties style. 'The perfect underpinnings are essential in achieving this look, which is why we launched our Perky Profile bra which projects the bust giving you a fuller, more pronounced shape for the ultimate Sweater Girl look. 'This lingerie innovation uses a completely new cup shape creating a higher bust point giving a more stand out shape.' Paschal Little, head of lingerie innovation at M&S added: 'The unique and innovative smoothing cups have been engineered with extra projection at the bust point providing a modern silhouette which emulates glamour icons from the 1940's Hollywood era. 'This gives a great new shape under this season's ""New Look"" silhouette.' Although the perky profile bra and drop a dress size dress have been grabbing most of the headlines, they aren't the only body enhancing pieces to have arrived at M&S in recent months.

Other new additions to the brand's output include the 'no gap shirt' which has a hidden placket and an extra button to ensure that you never flash your bra again. Also proving popular is the new Light as Air bra, which weighs just 39 grams - a whopping 11 grams less than the average bra. With no padding and made using new moulding techniques, the bra gives a smooth shape without adding weight. 'The ultra light weight and breathable materials used in our Light as Air bra [were] developed to keep you cool and comfortable in the warmer months,' added Little. 'We have incorporated an airy, open work channel below the cup to increase the feeling of coolness, comfort and airflow through the garment. 'This modern concept bra is neither padded nor non padded, but is moulded to give you a feminine shape with definition.' (Dita is wearing her Von Follies collection.

"The waiter who has confessed to . killing two British women in a Turkish wood earlier tried to cover up . their murders by claiming they had been abducted by a gang of men. Recep Cetin, 17, has been charged with . stabbing to death Marion Graham, 54, following a row over her daughter . Shannon, 15, who he was dating. He is alleged to have driven Mrs . Graham and her friend Kathy Dinsmore, 54, to a forest near Izmir and . killed them. Mrs Graham was stabbed in her heart and Mrs  Dinsmore had . her throat cut. Accused: Recep Cetin with 15-year-old Shannon. He wanted to marry her and start a new life in Ireland . Recep Cetin allegedly drove the two women to a forest and killed them . Cetin, who has been remanded in . custody, was a well-known figure on the beachfront at the Turkish resort . of Kusadasi, on the Aegean Sea on the west of the country, and was . nicknamed ‘Alex’ by British tourists. The teenager, who dropped out of . school at 13, had been dating Shannon for two years. In May, he rented a . villa in Kusadasi which he shared with Shannon, her mother and Miss . Dinsmore. Mrs Graham and her daughter, who lived . in County Down, Northern Ireland, but travelled on Irish passports, . spent the summer months in Turkey. Recep Celik is accused of stabbing Marion Graham (left) and Kathy Dinsmore, from Northern Ireland . Shared: The house in Korukent, Kusadasi, where they all lived . But neighbours say they often heard shouting and arguing coming from the villa. Reports claim Cetin told police he had . pleaded with Marion one last time in the woods to let Shannon stay in . Kusadasi and marry him. But she refused, claiming Shannon was too young, . and was supported by her friend Kathy. One resident said: ‘They didn’t really . fit in here. It’s a very quiet, friendly place. There was a lot of . aggression and raised voices – we kept our distance.’ On Thursday, Cetin . offered to take Marion and Kathy on a shopping trip to Izmir, 70 miles . away, after dropping off Shannon to go on a boat trip. According to Cetin’s uncle, who has . asked not to be named, Cetin then used a local taxi to ferry them to . Izmir where his father Eyup runs a corner shop. From there Cetin took a . family car to drive the women out to the woodland area of Buca. Cetin returned to Kusadasi where he . claimed a black van had pulled up in the forest with three men inside. He said the men tried to abduct Marion and Kathy, and while trying to . fight them off he was cut on the hand and knocked unconscious. Media reports in Turkey have named Recep Celik as the suspect in the double murder . But according to his uncle his story was unconvincing. ‘When I arrived at Kusadasi police . station Cetin and Shannon were there. Cetin had a cut bandaged on his . hand. He couldn’t explain how he returned to Kusadasi.’ Turkish police initially arrested Cetin’s father, Eyup, and the taxi driver that had taken the group to Izmir.
