"A Sydney mother-of-two who defended her decision to open up about her job as a high-class escort even though she has potentially exposed her young children to ridicule says her work is empowering for women. Former journalist Amanda Goff, whose working name is Samantha X, said going public about her career and making her children, aged five and seven, vulnerable to school yard bullying was no different to children of gay parents who faced the same hardships. 'Children are teased mercilessly every day and their mother does not have to be working in the sex industry,' the 40-year-old said. The high-class escort, who goes by the name of Samantha X, was a former journalist who worked for New Idea and InStyle . She spends one week as a full-time mother and the next at a luxury apartment in Sydney's CBD as Samantha X . Ms Goff has two children under the age of seven who she shares custody with her former partner . 'I think the world is changing. My kids are in classes with kids that have gay parents, lesbian mothers, they’re not ridiculed.' She talked candidly about her profession as a sex worker to spruik her novel, Hooked - Secrets of a High-Class Escort, on Channel Seven's Sunday Night. Ms Goff told the program she volunteered at the tuckshop of her children's school and most of the parents there knew what she did for a living. She has worked as a journalist at InStyle, Prevention and New Idea magazines, but now she charges $800 an hour for her services or $5,000 for an entire night. Ms Goff spends one week as a full-time mother to her children - who she shares custody with her former partner - and the next in a luxury apartment in Sydney's CBD where she carries out her life as Samantha X. Amanda Goff has hit back at criticism of her parenting skills after she publicly announced she works both as an escort and in her children's school canteen . 'When I look back on how I juggled the two lives, I am astounded,' Ms Goff said. Ms Goff said despite what many may think, her work as an escort wasn't all about sex. 'I haven’t had sex for ages actually... I’m like a naked therapist,' she told Kyle and Jackie O's radio program Kiis on Monday. 'A lot of men have told me about putting their dogs down and I’ve wiped away a lot of tears. They’re paying for my time, so what they do in that time is really up to them. 'I have champagne and beer but they often want a cup of tea. 'It is an empowered job for a woman and I think we all have the right… as long as we’re not hurting anyone.' The 40-year-old believes her decision to come out as an escort was not a 'big bloody deal' when it came to affecting her children . The mother-of-two charges $800 an hour or $5,000 a night for her time . Ms Goff (pictured here three years ago) used to work at InStyle, Prevention and New Idea magazines but is now a private escort . The 40-year-old is a mother-of-two and started escorting in 2012, two days after she visited a brothel . Ms Goff (left in 2010 and pictured right in the front row, far right in 2009) said most of the parents at her children's school know what she does for a living and are supportive . Ms Goff also claimed that her current job as a sex worker, is more ethical than her former career as a journalist in which she admits she hid in bushes and illegally hacked phones . The escort recalled one incident where she was rushing to pick up her children at school and was sitting outside in her car when a client with a foot fetish messaged her, asking for a picture of her toes. The 40-year-old said she made a decision to come clean because she wanted to be free, saying she did not think it was 'such a big bloody deal', adding: 'Who am I hurting?' Despite potentially exposing her young children to ridicule, Ms Goff said she had considered the repercussions before writing her book. 'I didn’t wake up one day and say I’m going to write a book about being a hooker. I’ve thought about this very carefully, I’ve been seeing a child psychologist for a year,' she said. Despite potentially exposing her young children to ridicule, Ms Goff said she had considered the repercussions before writing her book . The escort said friends and peers had been very supportive of her transition into the industry in 2012 . 'My kids know that mummy is a journalist… they know she makes sad people feel happy and they know she’s creative and wrote a book. That’s all they need to know at the moment.' Despite the stigma surrounding the profession, the escort said friends and peers had been very supportive of her transition into the industry in 2012 after visiting a brothel during her lunch break while she was still a beauty editor for a magazine. Two days later she was paid to have sex with men at an exclusive brothel in Sydney and 18 months later she moved into private escorting as Samantha X. But her parents - who live in a middle-class suburb in England - and her former partner were not as enamored with her new career path. Ms Goff's parents told her she was 'disgusting' when they found out the truth and her ex-husband's response was: 'Are you effing serious?'. The escort said friends and peers had been very supportive of her transition into the sex industry . 'When I look back on how I juggled the two lives, I am astounded,' Ms Goff tells Sunday Night reporter James Thomas (pictured) Goff charges $800 an hour or $5,000 a night for her services, and said she can teach married couples a thing or two . A former colleague of Ms Goff told Daily Mail Australia they were not surprised to learn of the woman's double life. 'I'm not shocked at all - she's always been a bit close to the edge. She follows her own rules. 'And I'm not surprised she's going on TV and saying it's her - I think she's always secretly wanted to be famous,' the colleague said. 'I think she's always wanted a life that's bigger than what she had. To be famous and rich. And using something to catapult her into the limelight. 'She's always been very bold and goes for what she wants. She's very single-minded. I always thought she used her looks and her boldness to get what she wants.' After her time sleeping with married men who pay her more than three times the average weekly salary, she says she knows the secret to a happy marriage. Ms Goff said listening was key as many men complained they were not being heard to by their spouse. She said she did not think that her clients sleeping with her were committing adultery because she gave her clients an outlet to escape from their normal lives and they could go home as happier husbands. Ms Goff said most of her clients did not see it as straying from their wives because there was no emotional commitment.

"For one lucky Arizona man, an unassuming $5.99 second-hand watch languishing in a thrift store has paved the way to wedded bliss. Zach Norris said he went to a Goodwill charity store in Phoenix last month looking for a golf cart, but a rare Swiss timepiece caught his eye. Norris, an avid watch collector, said he grew excited when he recognized the 1959 Jaeger-LeCoultre diving watch. What a find! Zach Norris went to a Goodwill store in Arizona last month looking for a golf cart, but instead he found a rare 1959 Jaeger-LeCoultre diving watch priced at only $5.99 (pictured left and right) Eyes on the prize: As an avid watch collector, Norris knew at once that the watch was worth a small fortune . There were only about 900 of the watches ever made. Paul White, vice president of Scottsdale-based Oliver Smith Jeweler, a dealer for the brand, said a watchmaker authenticated Norris' discovery. Norris shared his good fortune on Hodinkee.com, a website for watch collectors, and another enthusiast from San Francisco snapped it up for $35,000. As part of the deal, the Jaeger-LeCoultre's proud new owner, noted Rolex dealer and collector Eric Ku, even threw in an Omega Speedmaster watch worth $4,000 when he met Norris in San Francisco in late January. The Phoenix man says most of the proceeds from the sale will go toward paying for his upcoming wedding to his fiancee, Leandra Knudson. Rare: There were only about 900 of the watches ever made .

The two have be talking about tying the knot for a while now, but Norris says now they finally can begin planning the October 2015 nuptials in earnest. He also donated a portion of the profits back to Goodwill. Norris says he was not surprised that Goodwill staffers assigned the precious watch such a low value. ‘Sometimes they just miss it, they don't know,’ Norris tells AZfamily.com. ‘It's not a very fancy-looking piece. You have to know what it is.’ Being a passionate watch collector, Norris knew at once the true value of this watch as soon as he set eyes on it. Laughing all the way to the alter: Norris, pictured here with his fiancee, Leandra, says most of the proceed will go towards their upcoming wedding . The Phoenix resident recounted how when he went to pay for it, he was too nervous to even let the cashier handle his purchase. ‘I was like, you can scan it in my hand if you want to. I just didn't want to let it go,’ he said. Goodwill spokeswoman Summer Dunham says Norris' find shows there are deals to be had at the thrift stores.","Zach Norris went to Goodwill store in Phoenix in January looking for a golf cart, but instead he found a 1959 Jaeger-LeCoultre diving watch .

"Jack Wilshere has backed new Arsenal team-mate Danny Welbeck to have a big impact for club and country this season. Welbeck joined the Gunners on Monday in a shock £16million move from Manchester United. With Olivier Giroud out for three months because of an ankle injury, Welbeck is likely to be thrown straight into Arsenal's first-team and he may now start in England's Euro 2016 qualifier in Switzerland on Monday after Daniel Sturridge suffered an injury in training. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jack Wilshere: Danny Welbeck is a great signing for Arsenal . Gunners: jack Wilshere and new Arsenal team-mate Danny Welbeck train for England . Welbeck injected pace, invention and purpose into a dithering team upon his introduction against Norway on Wednesday night, which bodes well for England and Arsenal, according to Wilshere. 'He is a great addition for Arsenal and hopefully he will keep performing for England as well,' the Arsenal midfielder said. 'He has got great enthusiasm, he wants to run, he will track back, and he has got great quality. 'A lot of people don't give him credit for his technical ability, but he is great on the ball. I am sure there were a few clubs wanting him and there are not many players his age who move from one big club to another big club so that shows his quality.' Sturridge was sent for a scan after suffering an injury in training at St George's Park on Friday - two days before the squad departs for Switzerland. Transfer: Danny Welbeck joined Arsenal from Manchester United, and may go straight in to the side . It was an injury scare Roy Hodgson could do without, especially after the negative backlash that followed England's uninspiring 1-0 win over the Norwegians. Just 40,181 people turned up to watch the victory, which came courtesy of a Wayne Rooney penalty. The 22-year-old thinks England can start to win the fans back by beating the Swiss in Basle on Monday night. 'Going over to Switzerland is a tough game we know if we put in the performance and get the result the fans are going to come back on our side,' said Wilshere, who thinks the negative reaction to England's winless World Cup campaign has been over the top. Criticism: Jack Wilshere has been criticised by Paul Scholes and Jamie Redknapp for his performances . 'If people analysed it a bit more they would have been a bit kinder, there were just a few individual errors and a few lapses in concentration, but at that level that is what you are going to get,' he added. 'When you are playing against (Mario) Balotelli and (Luis) Suarez that is what you are going to get, they are going to punish you and they did. 'But if you look at the games, we had more positives than people give us credit for.' Wilshere only started one game at the World Cup - the lifeless, miserable dead rubber against Costa Rica in Belo Horizonte. But with Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard now retired, he is one of the first names on the team sheet. Future: With Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard retiring from international football, Wilshere is the future . Many pundits, including ex-internationals like Paul Scholes and Jamie Redknapp, have cast doubt on his ability recently, claiming he has not lived up to the hype that surrounded him when he made his England debut four years ago. Injury has hindered the 21-cap midfielder, but he says he is now almost back to peak fitness. 'It is a big season for me. I have never hid away from that,' Wilshere added. 'I have had a good pre-season for the first time in a few years, I have trained every session, played in all but one of the games. 'I feel good, I am getting stronger and stronger, I am getting near to where I want to be.' Wilshere knows he and Jordan Henderson, who wore the number four shirt vacated by Gerrard on Wednesday, have big shoes to fill. 'Obviously it's disappointing when Steven and Frank retired, they were massive players for England, over the last 10 years they were great ambassadors and that is the level me and Jordan have got to get to,' Wilshere said.","Danny Welbeck joined Arsenal from Manchester Untied for £16million .

"Body Mass Index (BMI) has been used for years to measure whether we need to watch what we're eating. But numerous professionals have come forward saying that unless you are severely overweight tracking your health and fitness through BMI may be redundant. As a result, sales of speciality scales - which measure your body composition including levels of muscle, fat and water - are soaring. Some of these use Bio-electrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) technology to safely pass a signal through the body to tell you if you're carrying too much fat, and where it's being stored. Scroll down for video . A slim person with little muscle mass and a stomach paunch could be classed as healthy, despite visceral fat . BMI involves dividing your weight in kgs by your height in metres squared to monitor weight and health. But it fails to accurately assess your body fat as a muscly athlete might be classed as obese, despite carrying little or no body fat, simply because muscle is more dense - i.e. heavier - than fat. At the other end of the scale, a slim person with little muscle mass and a stomach paunch could be classed as healthy, despite the fact that they may be carrying excessive fat around the waistline. This is important because visceral fat, which lies in and around the abdomen, is thought to be a key risk factor in the development of type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Visceral fat secretes molecules that, among other things, lead to damaging inflammation in blood vessels. This flaw in BMI is why even super-fit people can be told to go on extreme diets because they register as overweight or obese on the chart. Personal trainers like to track your circumferential measurements (girth measurements - waist, hips etc) Dr David Ashton, an obesity expert and medical director at Healthier Weight, said: 'The greatest concern is that BMI doesn't address the critical issue of how much fat a person has in their body and where it is distributed.' New products and guides are fast coming out in the hope of giving more accurate and helpful measures of health based on what your weight is made up of - rather than what it totals. Tanita body composition monitors, for example, can help you track your fitness, measure body composition and lose excess fat using BIA. Instead of simply reading your overall body mass and calculating your weight, they measure statistics such as weight, body fat percentage, muscle mass, body water, basal metabolic rate and visceral fat. They've just brought out the Tanita BC-730, one of the first speciality BIA scales created for the home rather than the gym, for £45. A spokesperson for Tanita says: 'It's incredibly important to monitor your body composition when losing weight. When you exercise more or start dieting, your body composition will change, even if your weight stays the same.' Low-calorie crash diets may produce speedy results, but the weight loss will most likely be from water and even healthy, lean muscle tissue. They can force your body into starvation mode, storing body fat rather than burning it - so even if you lose weight your body fat could increase. The Tanita BC-730, BIA scales created for the home, come in at £45 . Personal trainer Jack Braniff of Urban Energie Fitness has his own ways of making sure a client is making progress. He says: 'Weighing yourself does have its place, but can't be seen as the only measurement to look out for. 'It doesn't provide us with the whole story, not taking into account hydration levels, lean body mass, how healthy you are, and even though they weigh the same, muscle looks far better than fat! 'Likewise, bio-electrical impedance analysis still isn't a great tool in terms of accuracy. 'As a current is used to determine your fat percentage it will look for the easiest way out of your body, so a lot of these machines where you only stand on, or hold, miss whole sections! 'One day they could give a good reading, and on another you could get a bad reading. Hydration levels will also reduce accuracy of results. 'I like to use a number of different metrics when testing how well someone is doing. 'They include body fat, circumferential measurements - girth measurements - waist, hips - skin folds, how your clothes fit and your weight. 'But the easiest and most noticeable metric will be before and after photographs - and for most of you, how you look is probably the reason why you're doing this! 'Bod Pods are your best bet but are expensive, a few places in London do them. For a bit cheaper, a good PT should be able to take skin fold measurements which are great, unless you're obese (then weight is the best tool!).' Jack Braniff of Urban Energie Fitness (r) has his own ways of making sure a client is making progress . The easiest and most noticeable metric will be before and after photographs - and for most of you, how you look is probably the reason why you're doing this! - says personal trainer Jack Braniff . Bod Pods look like a giant white plastic egg that you can sit in. They use air displacement to work out your mass (weight) using very accurate electronic scales, and volume. From these calculations, body density and fat levels can be worked out. Behind the seat is a moving 'diaphragm' which varies the volume inside the front chamber. This is measured before and after you get in, with your body volume therefore worked out by subtraction. For example, if the interior air volume of the empty chamber is 400 litres, and the volume of the chamber is reduced to 350 litres with the subject inside, the body volume of the subject would be 50 litres. Bod Pods readings are available in hospitals such as University Hospital in Coventry and are able to work out your detailed body mass, fat mass and body volume - as well as an estimate on your own personal metabolic rate.","Professionals say tracking your fitness through BMI is redundant .

"The Prince of Wales has paid tribute to close friend Joan Rivers praising her 'enormous zest for life' after her death yesterday at the age of 81. Prince Charles and his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, said they were 'deeply saddened' to hear the news about the comedian, who died in a Manhattan hospital yesterday after she went into cardiac arrest during a routine throat procedure last week. Miss Rivers was a guest at the royal couple's wedding in 2005 and also performed for the Prince, the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry at the We Are Most Amused comedy gala, in aid of the Prince's Trust. Scroll down for video . Joan Rivers, greeting Prince Charles after a performance for his charity the Prince's Trust in 2008. Today he paid tribute to comedian's 'zest for life' In a statement released by Clarence House today, the Prince of Wales said: 'Joan Rivers was an extraordinary woman with an original and indefatigable spirit, an unstoppable sense of humour and an enormous zest for life. She will be hugely missed and utterly irreplaceable.' The comedian struck up an unlikely friendship with the royal couple in 2003, when they were introduced on a painting holiday in the South of France by a mutual friend. As they became closer, she was invited to the couple’s wedding reception at Windsor Castle — one of only four Americans on the list — and took part in a comedy show to mark Charles’ 60th birthday in 2008. She also enjoyed private charity dinners at the Prince's Highgrove estate and was a keen supporter of osteoporosis suffers, a cause close to Camilla's heart. In 2011, she recalled the time she enjoyed a dinner at the estate and made a toast against all protocol saying, 'I just want to say that this is for all you b*****s in the room who married your husbands for their money. Joan Rivers, pictured outside Windsor Castle in 2005 at the wedding of Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall . 'I know who you are and Charles knows, too, because I've pointed you all out to him', leaving her royal hosts in laughter. She also added how the couple got her humour adding: '‘I’d already told Camilla a joke about Cher liking younger men so much that she hangs around Toys ‘R’ Us, and she got it straight away. 'Charles and Camilla have a great sense of humour. 'He (Prince Charles) is so charming, so humorous. All the ­passions that everyone used to laugh at him for — organic food, architecture, talking to the flowers, we’re all into those things now. 'He is so far ahead of his time, and I think he will be a very good monarch. He is a very smart man and I adore him.'

They have been heard and appreciated. ‘My mother’s greatest joy in life was to make people laugh.

"The Massachusetts woman accused of beating and strangling her pregnant friend to death then cutting the baby out of her womb and claiming the child as her own was convicted of first-degree murder on Wednesday. Julie Corey sobbed as a Worcester Superior Court jury found her guilty of the 2009 murder of 23-year-old Darlene Haynes. The jurors had deliberated for 10 hours over two days. Sentencing has been scheduled for Tuesday. Prosecutors said Haynes was eight months pregnant when Corey attacked her and cut the baby out of her body. They told the jury that Corey had been pregnant, too, but had a miscarriage three months earlier and told her boyfriend and family that Haynes' baby was her own.

'It's probably the most horrific case this office has ever seen in terms of facts,' District Attorney Joseph Early Jr. said in a statement after the verdict was handed down. 'This woman was killed for her baby.' Corey, 39, did not testify during the trial. Corey's lawyers contended that police failed to follow up on leads that could have implicated other potential suspects in the killing, including Haynes' ex-boyfriend. They also suggested that Haynes' ex-boyfriend had given Corey and her boyfriend, Alex Dion, the baby. Dion denied that on the witness stand. Defense lawyer Michael Wilcox said he was disappointed with the verdict, but not surprised. He said they plan to appeal. 'We were aware of the evidence against her,' Wilcox said, adding that the facts alone in the case were difficult to discuss. 'We worked very hard to present the jury with a different picture, but we weren't ultimately successful.' Wilcox said he would not comment on Corey's reaction but said it was understandable that she was upset. Darlene Haynes was brutally murdered and her fetus was cut from her stomach .

'She faced the somber realization that she will spend the rest of her life in prison,' he said. Haynes' body was found in a closet in her apartment on July 27, 2009. She had been beaten in the head and strangled with an electrical cord. Her abdomen had been cut open, and her baby was gone.

Dion said that he and Corey, who has an 11-year-old son from a previous relationship, had dated on and off for about two years and in October 2008 she told him she was pregnant. Dion testified that Corey, whom he . believed was pregnant at the time, called him on July 23, 2009, and told . him she was giving Haynes a ride to a store. Later that night, Corey called him to say her water had broken and a friend was taking her to the hospital to give birth, Dion said.

He said he and Corey introduced the baby to family and friends over the next couple of days. But at the celebration which followed, some relatives were suspicious when Corey said she had been in labor for only 20 minutes and had returned home five hours later. She appeared to be breast-feeding the baby under a blanket but there was a bottle of formula milk nearby. The tiny girl's umbilical cord also did not look like it had been cut by a doctor and was tied with a ribbon. Friends contacted police after hearing of Haynes's death. After Corey's arrest, Dion told a newspaper in Worcester, 'I am so confused. I don't know what to think. I thought I had a brand new daughter.' When asked why it has taken five years to go to trial, Paul Jarvey, a spokesperson for Worcester District Attorney Joseph D. Early Jr said, 'It's just a complicated case.' Dion's family said Corey introduced a baby girl to them at a family gathering on July 25, 2009, two days before Haynes' body was discovered. Several days later, authorities found Corey, Dion and the baby at a homeless shelter in Plymouth, N.H. Dion was not charged. DNA testing showed that Haynes, 23, was the mother of the baby.

Porto: 87 games, 72 goals. Atletico Madrid: 91 games, 87 goals. Monaco: 22 games, 13 goals. OVERALL: 200 games, 172 goals. United have already seen one expensive signing excel in an international friendly this week, Angel Di Maria taking a stride in answering those who feel this £60m signing was a luxury the club could do without. He was magnificent, his outside-of-the-boot assist for Sergio Aguero in Argentina’s 4-2 win over Germany the work of a rare talent. He had two other assists and a goal on Wednesday. So, over to Falcao, a man who cost £6m to rent from Monaco for a year, whose salary comes to £280,000 a week. The hope at Old Trafford is that the formalities with his visa will enable a debut against QPR on September 14. At his best, he is a striker who might just make up for the obvious defensive and midfield deficiencies in the United squad. Conceding three doesn’t matter if you score four, and all that. His record in front of goal is brilliant. Injury lay-off: Falcao missed the World Cup with a cruciate knee ligament injury . At River Plate – 45 goals in 105 games; at Porto – 72 in 87; at Atletico Madrid - 70 in 91; at Monaco 13 in 22. For Colombia he has 20 goals from 51 games. They are fantastic numbers, those of a wrecking ball in front of goal. They compensate for his slight lack of a wider contribution – he has assisted only 12 goals for team-mates since moving to Europe in 2009, a period in which he has scored 155 in 200 games. So goals will be the main measure of his success at United. And to do that, his left knee will need to be strong. For all the excitement about the player United have signed, it must be set against a record of only two starts since he tore his anterior cruciate ligament in January. Will he still have that acceleration, that agility to twist and turn before finishing? Early days: Falcao made his name at River Plate in Argentina before moving to Europe . It is not an ideal backdrop to his first major role at one of the world’s truly elite clubs, even if United have seen far better days. It goes without saying that his record at Atletico, his only spell in a major league, was all the more remarkable because he lacked the support that Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi enjoy. But with a bigger club comes bigger pressures, not least when Falcao is seen as one of the major players responsible for getting United out of the incredible hole they dug. And how committed is he to that cause? How frustrated is he that he won’t be part of the Real Madrid side defending their Champions League crown, a competition in which Falcao has not appeared since 2010? Five days ago he tweeted it was a ‘dream come true’ to join Real. His father, Radamel Garcia, explained: ‘The deal with Real Madrid did not happen because if you have money and you go to the market to buy a shirt or a pair of trousers, you have to decide whether to buy it or not. Making a splash: Falcao was prolific during his two years at Porto . Kicking on: The Colombian continued his outstanding goalscoring form at Atletico Madrid . Short stay: Falcao spent only one season at Monaco before joining Manchester United this week . ‘Real Madrid chose not to. I don’t know, I have the feeling they wanted the player for free with a number of conditions. In any case, they bought the trousers and shirt they wanted and they considered that to be better. We have to accept it.’ It all leaves plenty of questions. Another surrounds the decisions next summer, when Falcao will be 29. It will be interesting to see if United then see worth in a deeper investment, or if their top-four aims have been achieved via this short-term project. So much will be learned in the coming weeks. If Falcao is over his injury, his Real disappointment and can adapt to the biggest pressure of his career, Manchester United might just have signed the best out-and-out striker in football. And what a coup that would be. He needs his visa first. The following stats are based on 2013-14 domestic league seasons: . Diego Costa . 35 games. 27 goals. 109.63 mins per goal .

"If you're a Facebook user, chances are there are one or two people in your friends’ list that you wouldn’t want to spend time with in real life. And a poll has discovered that the reason we keep these so-called ‘famicable’ friends on the site is purely so we can snoop on what they’re up to. The survey found that 68 per cent of users have Facebook friends they don’t like - and almost half would actively avoid these people in the street. The poll was carried out by New York-based CouponCodesPro. Of 2,570 U.S. users surveyed, 68% said they are friends with people on Facebook they don't like, and the top reason was because they wanted to snoop on what the other persons was up to . But the group admitted they didn’t want to unfriend them because they wouldn’t be able to be nosey. When asked why users refuse to delete Facebook friends they don't like, the following reasons were: . 1. I like to see what they’re up to - 69 per cent . 2. They’re family, or a loved one’s family member - 57 per cent . 3. They’re a colleague or former colleague that I need to stay in contact with - 54 per cent . 4. They’d cause a scene if I deleted them as a friend - 50 per cent . 5. Having them as a friend lets me see what others are doing, for example my children - 31 per cent . Other reasons included that the person was a family member, work colleague, or the ‘friend’ would cause a scene if they were deleted. More than 2,570 American adults who regularly use social media took part in the poll, which quizzed them about how they used their social media accounts. All respondents in the Money saving site CouponCodesPro survey were asked to reveal how many Facebook friends they had at the time of the poll, and the average was 671. When asked how many contacts on the site they would consider to be true friends, respondents said an average of just 18 - not even 3 per cent of their entire friends list. All respondents were then asked to elaborate, and when asked ‘Are you friends with anyone on social media that you dislike but are falsely amicable with online?’, more than two thirds (68 per cent) said yes. When respondents were asked 'Would you go out of your way to avoid the Facebook friends you dislike in real life?' (stock image pictured) almost half said yes. And when asked roughly how many Facebook friends they had that met this criteria, the average response was 19 . Do you add people you don't like as Facebook friends?

When the relevant respondents were asked ‘Would you go out of your way to avoid the Facebook friends you dislike in real life?’ almost half said yes. And when asked roughly how many Facebook friends they had that met this criteria, the average was 19. According to the poll, 20 per cent of Facebook users have also taken part in an argument on the site, and almost half said the reason was due to a vague status they thought was aimed at them. George Charles, spokesperson for CouponCodesPro.com, said: ‘The results of this study are  interesting; just the fact alone that so many of us are friends with people on Facebook that we don’t really like and would go out of our way to avoid. ‘As a society, we share so much personal information on social media and there’s an increasingly overwhelming need to stay up-to-date with what everyone is up to in their lives, whether they’re our friends or not. ‘Something worth noting that is that if you’re using social media to keep an eye on what others are doing, there’s a very real chance people are doing the same to you.'","More than 2,570 U.S. Facebook users aged over 18 took part in the poll .

"This is the moment a Kurdish reporter walked to the ISIS border and confronted jihadi militants. Hunar Ahmad, a correspondent for Kurdish-language news channel Rudaw, strolled into the middle of a bridge and shouted over to the fighters that he wanted to interview them. The men, who were allegedly building a Caliphate border post at the site near Kirkuk, ignored Mr Ahmad before warning him not to come any closer. Shocking: Hunar Ahmad strolled towards the murderous militants near Kirkuk calling for an interview . Dangerous: The Kurdish news reporter waved wildly at the jihadis, brandishing a red microphone . It comes after the group seized the Yazidi border town of Sanjir, telling residents: convert or die. United Nations human rights experts have warned that the world must take 'all possible measures' to prevent a massacre of minorities in Iraq as the UK continued aid drops but resisted calls for military intervention. But incredibly, Mr Ahmad casually sidles up towards the border separating the murderous militants and Kurdish Peshmerga troops. One Peshmerga soldier advises him: 'Speak Arabic if you can' - as he advances clutching a red microphone. Holding the microphone out to the soldiers, he shouts: 'Would anyone like to speak to Rudaw?' There is no response from the 10 men standing 100 metres away clutching a black Islamic State flag. 'We are here close to IS militias at Merriam-Beg, they have made here the border lines,' he tells the camera, according to Rudaw's translation. 'We are here to interview anyone of them but they are refusing to talk.' Undeterred, he tries again, waving his hand at the jihadis as he advances into No Man's Land. No Man's Land: Kurdish Peshmerga soldiers do not dare to go near the bridge for fear of attack . Repeated attempts: Mr Ahmad kept shouting at the militants as they seemingly constructed a border . Warning: The dozen men standing by the ISIS flag warned Mr Ahmad not to come any closer to their site . He shouts details about Rudaw as tractors can be seen shovelling mounds of dirt onto the border line. Eventually he turns back: 'We repeatedly tried to talk to the IS militias, but they are busy strengthening their frontlines right here. 'They are warning me not to get any closer.' The militants, who have shorten their name from ISIS (The Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham) to IS (The Islamic State), are believed to be strengthening their forces at the site near Kirkuk, north of Baghdad. It comes after they seized Sanjir, home to 500,000 Yazidis. Thousands of the minority sect were today desperately trying to escape the bloody Islamic State militants. Battlegrounds: The militants have seized the Yazidi town of Sanjir, north west of Kirkuk, where they are now . Fleeing: The military helicopter crashed on a mountain as it tried to provide aid to the 500,000-strong Yazidi population in Sinjar (pictured), near the Syrian border, as they flee Sunni militants of the Islamic State . Horrific: The refugees are trying to find safety after Isil gave them the ultimatum: convert to Islam or die . They are left with little option but to head from one war zone to another as they advance on the Syrian border. The refugees, most of them women and children, were seen today slowly walking in the agonising midday 45C sun towards the Syrian border town of Elierbeh of Al-Hasakah Governorate. Persecuted by ISIS for their beliefs and forced out of Sinjar, their survival options are brutal: Head for the barren Iraqi mountain range where others have been trapped by Islamic State militants for a week with no food and water - or walk the gruelling miles, often with young children to join the 10,000 to 15,000 Yazidis who have already fled to neighbouring Syria. Aid has been sent, but a member of the Iraqi air force today warned it could take up to 500 days to rescue the 50,000 refugees unless the UK and U.S. helps with the evacuations. Desperate: The United Nations has warned the world must take 'all possible measures' to avoid a massacre . Today, an Iraqi helicopter providing aid to the Yazidis stranded on a mountain in the area crashed and killed the pilot after too many tried to climb aboard. Twenty evacuees were injured in the accident on a mountain in Sinjar, including Iraqi MP Vian Dakheel, a member of the minority Yazidi community. She and others on board the Russian-built Mi-17 craft were escorted to a hospital in the nearby Kurdish autonomous region. The Yazidis, a 500,000 strong people, follow an ancient religion with links to Zoroastrianism but are seen as infidels by the radical Islamists. Dakheel, the sole politician from the Yazidi community, made an impassioned plea in parliament to save her people before leaving for the north.","Hunar Ahmad, reporter for Kurdish station Rudaw, approached border .

"These riders can’t believe their eyes! They may look rather strange but they are actually testing a new way of experiencing a roller coaster. With theme parks battling to add evermore twists, turns and loop-the-loops to terrify thrill-seekers, researchers are also testing ways of adding an extra fear-factor. By wearing an Oculus Rift VR headset, the roller coaster rides present a virtual dimension to the rider and they can fly through space, ride on the backs of dragons and swoop through dangerous terrain. It may sound too good to be true but the people behind VR Coaster have already started testing the technology... and based on the comments of the ride testers, the experiment was a resounding success. The Augmented Thrill Ride Project is the very first synchronised virtual reality ride on real roller coasters and hundreds of test rides were carried out in Germany's Europa-Park. For the test, coaster cars are rigged with laptops and cameras, and the wheels fitted with special electronics, setting the scene for a ride testers will never forget. The testers strap themselves in, psyching themselves for the ride of their lives. One tester plays the video game whilst the other gets to experience the view ahead, which is enhanced and influenced both by the game and by the movements of his head. Scroll down for video . Setting the scene: The coaster cars being prepared for the augmented reality ride with laptops and cameras . A tester slips on his virtual reality headset. Early stages of the test required an on board operator to synchronise the real and the VR ride . The roller coaster zooms off and almost immediately participants are screaming as the cold wind hits their skin. But the headset tester is looking around, instead of looking straight ahead like the other joyriders. At one point he looks up, as if he can see things that the others cannot. And indeed he can, as he is aware of a completely different view to the rest of the riders. As the roller coasters swoops, swerves and dives across twisting corners, the headset user is treated to a different sights, sounds and movements. One test rider is on horseback, riding in a virtual world of tunnels, windmills, and ogres. As the roller coaster hugs the tracks, curving ever-higher, the tester's virtual horse sprouts wings and evades a monster. The roller coasters' 360 degree turns are also echoed on the headset and the rider and his horse follow suit. The scene changes to another user, who is playing a game in space. Spaceman: Through the headset, the tester is travelling through space (inset), blasting away debris and fighting invaders . This tester sees himself flying across the sky (inset) past giants and monsters, on a winged horse . As the roller coaster moves, the rider ‘fires’ shots on his console, which, on his headset, translate as bullets from a space gun that decimate space debris, clearing a path for his spaceship. ‘Man, that was cool. This is was amazing, awesome, sensational,’ one tester says in German. Another tester said the ride was ‘epic’ and ‘better than without headsets’. ‘Awesome, a brilliant idea,’ an enthusiastic tester, who can barely hide her excitement, exclaims. The idea a synchronised virtual ride came from Thomas Wagner, a Virtual Design professor at the University of Applied Sciences Kaiserslautern, Germany.","The Augmented Thrill Ride Project lets users fly through space .

"Authorities confirmed on Thursday that the bodies of a man and woman found at a suburban Dallas home are those of the parents of a 10-year-old boy found dead in a bathtub at the house in January — a death for which the mother was charged with murder. The Collin County medical examiner confirmed that the bodies found Wednesday are those of Sumeet Dhawan, 43, and Pallavi Dhawan, 39, Frisco police said in a statement. Police have not said if the death might have been caused by suicide or murder suicide. Pallavi Dhawan had been free on $50,000 bond after Frisco police charged her with murder in the death of the Dhawans' son, Arnav. A medical examiner's report had said a natural cause was the most likely cause of the child's death. However, police had said Pallavi Dhawan had confessed to killing the boy — something the family's attorney, David Finn of Dallas, has strenuously denied. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Found dead: The Dallas home where a 10-year-old boy was found dead in January and whose parents were found dead on Wednesday . All dead: The Collin County medical examiner confirmed that the bodies found Wednesday are those of Sumeet Dhawan, 43, and Pallavi Dhawan, 39, the parents of Arnav who died in January . Officers had found Pallavi Dhawan's body in the family's backyard pool and Sumeet Dhawan's body in the house. Police are not saying how they died, and Finn said he had not been told if any marks were found on their bodies. Assistant Police Chief Darren Stevens said the department has been in contact with the extended Dhawan family 'and are doing everything possible to keep them informed over the course of this investigation.' Officers had found Arnav's body on Jan. 29 while making a welfare check at the house. He was wrapped in a cloth up to the neck, and there were empty plastic bags in the tub next to him. A police affidavit says Sumeet Dhawan told investigators that his wife was having mental health issues and that they had been having marital problems. Since Pallavi Dhawan's release on bond, Finn had expressed impatience with the police handling of their investigation in light of the medical examiner's findings. Finn has said that Arnav was a special-needs child, born with a brain cyst and microcephaly, a condition characterized by an abnormally small head, which could have factored in his death. The scene: Frisco Fire and Police department officials cover back gate as they investigate the scene at the home of Pallavi and Sumeet Dhawan, where a woman's body was found in the pool and another in the house . On Thursday, however, Finn acknowledged: 'I'm not sure that we'll ever know what happened.' Finn said he had been in contact with Sumeet Dhawan's relatives, who hope to send the bodies back to India for cremation in accordance with Hindu tradition. It's not clear if the bodies are in a condition suitable for the trip. If they aren't, 'they'll be cremated and the ashes sent back to India,' Finn said. FOX reports that the couple's attorney David Finn said that Pallavi's mother had contacted him from India to ask him to help in bringing Pallavi's and Sumeet's remains home for cremation. Finn said that he spoke with the couple days before their death and that he didn't notice any changes in behavior. However, he did say that Pallavi was under great stress during the investigation and that Sumeet told Frisco police that his wife had been depressed perhaps suicidal. Pallavi wanted to travel to a city in India to pray for her dead son but she was unable to get a passport due to her pending criminal case. Mourning: Arnav's parents, pictured months ago, wanted to be able to travel to India to honor their son but Pallavi was unable to get a passport . 'That's where it's believed that, if you go to only these specific cities, those are the preeminent spots, and if you do it for your loved ones, they'll get peace, Sumeet told FOX in February. Fox spoke with SMU theology professor Robert Hunt about the cultural importance of honoring the dead and about times when the Hindu religion allows for suicide. 'It's not only critically important as they think hopefully about the soul of the departed person, but this becomes a dangerous entity in a sense for the family, and to a certain extent brings an amount of shame and guilt to the family in terms of their wider relations,' said Robert Hunt. 'The very fact of being charged, the very fact of having an investigation go to a grand jury can being a deep sense of guilt and shame that, for an American, isn't going to be the first thing that happens,' said Hunt. He said that the Hindu belief generally rejects suicide but in some cases relating to great injustice, suicide if forgivable or even the right thing to do. 'Generally speaking, the cause of it, or the ostensible cause of it, is, and what makes it right, I should say, is that it calls attention to a grave injustice,' said Hunter. 'It becomes the only way that a completely powerless person can say, ‘This is unjust.'” Charged: Pallavi Dhawan, now dead, was a suburban Dallas mother, charged with murdering her 10-year-old son Arnav Dhawan . Mystery: Even though Arnav's mother was charged with his murder, it is likely he died of natural causes .","The Collin County medical examiner .

"A California high school has ditched their controversial Arab mascot and his genie sidekick after complaints by anti-discrimination campaigners. Coachella Valley High's mascot, who appears as a snarling man with a shaggy beard, hooked nose and head scarf, drew complaints from American-Arabs who felt it was derogatory. School officials have now agreed to redesign the figure, and ditched his belly-dancing genie counterpart, although they insist the school will keep its 'Arabs' nickname for sports teams. Scroll down for video . Coachella Valley High School has agreed to redesign its Arab mascot (pictured), and ditch his belly-dancing genie sidekick, after complaints from anti-discrimination campaigners . The Arab mascot has existed since the 1920s and is a nod to the desert region's reliance on date farming, a traditionally Middle Eastern crop. Over the years, the mascot evolved from a turban-wearing horseman carrying a lance to a standing figure with a scowl and traditional head covering. It came under fire last November when the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee sent a letter to the school district complaining that the mascot was stereotypical. The district refused to change the school's 'Arabs' nickname, but it agreed to redesign the Arab face on the school logo. The new design, which has been approved by the campaign group, depicts a stoic man with a neatly trimmed beard. The school has also dropped a belly-dancing genie (pictured) who often appeared at halftime shows . His face is partially covered in shadow and he's wearing a white headscarf emblazoned with the high school's initial, 'CV.' Committee spokesman Abed Ayoub said: 'We passed it around to experts and community members. We took our time to get the opinion of that logo, and it was overwhelmingly positive.' The school's current logo of the snarling mascot is still on the  welcome sign, the school website and a large mural on the campus gym. A spokesman for the school district said officials will soon make a joint announcement with anti-discrimination group to discuss a final resolution to the mascot controversy. 'We hope that those witnessing our collaboration will follow our lead and keep their eyes, ears and hearts open to the feelings of others,' the statement said.","School logo featured scowling Arab mascot with one tooth and hooked nose .

"This year's alligator hunting season is one for the history books in Mississippi, where the record has been shattered twice just days after hunting began. The new heaviest gator ever caught in the state was pulled from waters near Vicksburg on Sunday and weighed a whopping 792-pounds. Just the day before, the record had been broken when a 756-pounder was snagged. Scroll down for video . Behemoth: A record-breaking alligator weighing just shy of 800 pounds was caught in Mississippi on Sunda . Historical hunting season: The gator beat the previous record, set just the day before, by just 36 pounds . Sunday's record beast measured 13.5 feet and was pulled in by a 3-man team led by Brian Montgomery of Starkville, reports WAPT. Shockingly, both Montgomery's team and the group that set the record the day before included Scott Berry of Raymond, Mississippi. Just three days into the season, Berry witnessed two all-time record catches. 'That's a unique experience that someone could be involved in two records in one season, and certainly within three days,' Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks' Alligator Program coordinator Ricky Flynt told the Clarion-Ledger. Helped on both hunts: Scott Berry had the unique experience of being involved in hunts that set records on back to back days . Plenty more time: Experts say there will likely be another record-setter before the season, which has weeks more to go, is over . Despite the massive size of the Mississippi gator (pictured), it's no world record. Just last month, an over 1,000-pound alligator was snagged in Alabama . Flynt says the gators in Mississippi have likely always been so massive, but people are getting better at finding the behemoths. For this reason, not to mention the weeks left of alligator hunting season in the state, Flynt figures the record will be broken again soon. 'I will not be surprised if they get one that exceeds 1,000 pounds and is 14 feet or longer,' he told NBC. In August, that very thing happened in neighboring Alabama when Mandy Stokes and her family snagged a 1,000-pound alligator--along with a nearly intact deer carcass later culled from its stomach.

Jaycee is the son of Hong Kong-born movie legend Jackie Chan, who rose to fame in Chinese martial arts movies, as well as U.S.-produced films such as the Rush Hour series.

Video Source IQIYI . His son Jaycee, who was born and raised in the U.S., is an actor and singer himself who has appeared in a string of movies which have failed at the Chinese box office. Chinese police confirmed they found the drugs at Jaycee's home and said the two arrested also tested positive for marijuana use. Jaycee has had several run-ins with his father over the years and in 2011, Jackie Chan said he would not be leaving his fortune to his son upon his death, but donating it to charity in order to force his son to earn his own money.

"A waitress has told how she feared for her life after hair dye triggered a horrific allergic reaction which left her unable to see for five days. Tina Littlewood, 41, had been colouring her hair for 20 years without any problems when she bought a kit ahead of a trip to visit her son on his Army base. But hours after applying the Clairol Nice ’N Easy dye, her face had swelled up like a ‘rugby ball’ and became covered in weeping blisters, which doctors later compared to a fire victim’s burns. Tina Littlewood was rushed to hospital after her head swelled up so much that she was unable to see . Eventually she required hospital treatment to fight the reaction. Now the hotel waitress has vowed never to colour her hair again and let it turn grey naturally. Mrs Littlewood said: ‘It was so terrifying that at one point I thought, “This is it, it’s over – I’m going to die because of a hair colour.” ‘It was agony. I thought I would be left blind if not worse. ‘It isn’t worth it. It was the most terrifying experience of my life – I never want to go through that again.’ Mrs Littlewood decided to use the Clairol dye, which she said she had used many times before, to cover up her grey hairs before visiting her 24-year-old son Matt, a soldier based in Norfolk. She said she followed the instructions on the packet, testing the dye on a patch of skin 48 hours before application, but experienced no reaction. However, within 20 minutes of using the dye on her hair, her head had started to itch. She said: ‘It got worse and worse so I went to bed and tried to forget about it. When I woke up in the morning I was in agony. The itching was so intense and I couldn’t open one eye. I looked in the mirror and my head was like a rugby ball.’ She developed a rash and weeping blisters broke out on her head. Tina Littlewood suffered an allergic reaction after using Clairol's Nice 'N Easy hair dye . Husband Glenn, a 41-year-old former soldier, initially took her to a doctor, who prescribed antihistamines to reduce the swelling. However, her symptoms became worse and both her eyes closed up due to the swelling. She added: ‘My pillow was soaked in pus. It was running off my head and from behind my ears – it was disgusting. I couldn’t even open my eyes.’ Mrs Littlewood, from Catterick, North Yorkshire, was taken to hospital where she was given steroid injections, antibiotics and antihistamines. Doctors there compared her burns to those of fire victims. She was treated as an outpatient and returned home, hoping the medication would cure her as soon as possible. But it was several days before she was able to see again. When her condition began to improve she ‘burst into tears of relief’ not least because she had recovered her sight. ‘Then I posted pictures on Facebook to warn all my friends and family,’ she said. ‘I’ll never dye my hair again.’ A spokesman for Clairol said: ‘The safety of the people who use our products is our first and most important priority, so we’re concerned to hear about this. ‘Allergic reactions are very rare and hair colourants are extensively researched to ensure they are safe when used as directed. ‘Millions of women safely and successfully use home hair colourants many times each year.’ After doctors prescribed a cocktail of steroid injections,  antibiotics and anti-histamines, the swelling began to subside .

"Suzuki has been forced to recall more than 19,000 mid-size cars in the U.S. after discovering spiders attracted to its gasoline vapours are weaving webs and blocking up the exhausts. The automaker issued the recall of their 2010 to 2013 Kizashi models after fears the webs could cause the gas tank to deform leading to a possible fire. It is thought that the spiders, although it is unknown which type, are drawn in by the gasoline vapours and once inside the exhaust begin to weave webs. The Sukuzi Kizashi, which has been recalled after spiders have been founded to weave webs in the exhaust which could cause a fire . This cuts off the air flow causing negative pressure in the gas tank which can lead to fuel leaks and even fire. The recall was prompted by seven reports of the problem, although according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, there have been no accidents or injuries in the U.S. due to the fault. Owners with affected cars will be notified this month and service centres will replace the vent line with one that is fitted with a filter to keep the spiders out and replace the gas tank if necessary. It is the second time a car manufacturer has been forced to recall vehicles due to problems with spiders. In April, Mazda recalled 42,000 Mazda 6 midsize cars in America with 2.5 litre engines due to a similar problem. It affected cars made from 2010 to 2012 after it was found yellow sac spiders, which are attracted to hydrocarbons, builds webs that cause pressure to build in the fuel tank. Owners with affected cars will be notified this month and service centres will replace the vent line with one that is fitted with a filter to keep the spiders out . The Kizashi was one of Suzuki's best selling models in the United States before they pulled out of the market last year after three years. It came after the American Sukuzi Motor Corp filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November 2012. Last month they also recalled nearly 26,000 midsize cars, including the 2004 to 2006 Verona, Forenza and Reno models in the U.S. because the daytime running light modules were at risk of overheating and causing a fire.","More than 19,000 2010 to 2013 Kizashi models have been affected by recall .

The case was brought to the attention of the DEA after a teenage drug user died earlier this year. 19-year-old Haley Brianne Kemp died from a heroin overdose in June. The young woman was found dead and it was determined she died as a result of a cocaine and heroin overdose. At the time of her arrest, Mrs Alvarez was on federal probation for a June 2006 drug trafficking conviction.

"Adding soy to your diet could speed up the rate at which breast cancer cells spread, scientists have warned. Researchers at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre in New York studied 140 women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. Half took soy protein powder containing genistein while the other half took a placebo for between seven and 30 days before they had surgery to remove their cancer. The scientists compared tumour tissues from before and after the operation and found changes in the expressions of certain genes, that are known to promote cell growth, in those women taking the soy supplement. Adding soy to your diet in the form of milk or tofu, pictured, could speed up the rate at which breast cancer cells spread in those women already diagnosed with the disease, scientists have warned . The findings led them to conclude the soy protein could potentially accelerate the progression of the disease. The study states: 'These data raise concern that soy may exert a stimulating effect on breast cancer in a sub set of women.' All those taking part in the study had recently had breast biopsies and were diagnosed with stage one or two breast cancer. They were all scheduled to have a mastectomy or lumpectomy two to three weeks later. The researchers said it is not yet clear if the effects can be reversed. Jacqueline Bromberg, co-author of the study, said: 'Although the genes were being expressed, it is not clear that this will translate into actual tumour growth. 'But the concern is that there may be the potential. 'Only 20 per cent of those patients who took the soy had really high levels of the genistein metabolite.' She said  the reasons behind the disparity are unclear, adding that there is no way to predict who would have this reaction after consuming soy. Of the women with high genistein levels, a few of them experienced changes in a specified set of genes that are known to affect breast cancer cell growth, death, or some aspect of breast cancer pathology, Dr Bromberg, said. The changes were seen in women who consumed around 51.6 grams of soy - the equivalent of about four cups of soy milk a day. The researchers concluded those who eat soy regularly could 'reasonably consume that amount' through the course of a day, particularly vegetarians and those who do not eat dairy products. The study only looked at the effect of a soy protein on those women already diagnosed with breast cancer. Pictured is a breast cancer cell. Researchers found the soy supplement accelerated the growth of the disease . They warned those living in Asian countries could be especially at risk, due to the high levels of tofu and soy in traditional diets. Dr Bromberg, said: 'We're not talking about 20 times more soy. 'We're talking about something that a person could eat.' The research did not address the question of whether soy does or does not prevent breast cancer, or whether soy would have any effect on women who have not already been diagnosed with the disease. Rather than avoid soy altogether, researchers said it is wise to consume it in moderation. Dr Bromberg, said: 'If you currently have early-stage breast cancer, don't eat soy in large amounts. 'If you've had breast cancer, you can eat soy but in moderation.' Dr Shike, added: 'It seems reasonable to advise at this present state of knowledge that women don't over consume soy. 'When it comes to nutrition, variety is important, and so is moderation.' The findings were published in the September 4 issue of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.","New York researchers found high levels of soy protein genistein could accelerate the progression of breast cancer cells .

"Strung between the palm trees in the middle of Avenido Lusico Costa was a crude, home-made banner. Black spray paint on what appeared to be a white sheet. ‘Luisito — Uruguay te apoya,’ it read. ‘Little Luis — Uruguay supports you.’ And it does. The Uruguayan team arrived at their beachfront home in Barra de Tijuca, to the west of Rio de Janeiro, on Thursday night to a hero’s welcome. Little Luis may be the big villain of this World Cup in the eyes of many, but critical and ethical faculties have been suspended in  his homeland. The fans that congregated around the team bus were unequivocal. ‘FIFA is corrupt,’ they chanted. ‘FIFA does not play football, but destroys it.’ VIDEO Scroll down for Maradona on Suarez ban: We can't keep retrospectively banning .

On . the Copacabana strip an adidas advert that shows Suarez, teeth bared . like a ferocious animal, is attracting a line of pictorial comedians — . posing circus-style with their heads in the lion’s mouth. Yet, for Uruguay, the banishment of Suarez is a disgrace, not a comic caption on Facebook. Arriving . in Barra the captain, Diego Lugano, was taken almost immediately to the . hotel’s gym, where he met that other noted arbiter of fair play, Diego . Maradona. The pair enjoyed a long and  animated conversation, in . Spanish, for the benefit of the television network covering Maradona’s . trip. TeleSUR is a Venezuelan company based in Caracas. Do your own . jokes, you know you want to. The . television screens high on the wall had Suarez’s clash with Giorgio . Chiellini of Italy on an almost constant loop, interspersed with the . most telegenic outrages of World Cups past. Horrific tackles, spitting . at the referee, flying elbows and a torrent of red cards and redder . mists were edited into a giant ball of malcontent. Yet it all kept coming back to one man, now close to quarantined back home in Uruguay, considering his next move. Maradona . was flat on his back lifting weights when Lugano entered, but on . sighting the captain he clambered to his feet to offer warm and . effusive congratulations for sticking up for Suarez in public. Glum-faced: Suarez will miss Uruguay's next nine matches and can't play for Liverpool again until October 26 . VIDEO Suarez persecuted by media - Lugano . There . was no doubt where Maradona also stood, having made his feelings plain . by going on air to present his television show De Zurda — it means ‘The .

The . pair began to talk for the TeleSUR cameras and it was clear this was . going to be no rigorous inspection of moral standards and the boundaries . of professional behaviour. ‘They . treated him like a criminal,’ said Lugano. ‘Escorted out of our camp by . the police. He did nothing. Why wouldn’t I defend him at that press . conference? He’s such a great guy and this ban is very harsh. ‘It hits him at the very top of his level, at the best moment in his career. It is a very sad time for  Uruguay and for Luis.’ Lugano . added that he hoped the team could grow stronger through adversity and . with the support of the people. ‘I don’t understand it,’ Maradona told . him. ‘The whole world was waiting to see Suarez at this World Cup. He . had scored 31 goals in England last season.’ They then agreed that . he had been banned only due to historical stuff. That this ancient . history was two previous offences for the same crime seemed of little . import. ‘This is the most important moment in Luis’s life,’ Lugano . concluded. If he meant that he had to now choose one path, glory or . infamy, therefore introducing the first tiny concession that behind this . furore was a basically contemptible act that could never be repeated, . he left the thought unsaid.

Maradona — still bitter over his expulsion from the 1994 World Cup for . drug offences — to identify with Suarez, whom he sees as another . renegade genius living beyond FIFA’s margins. Speaking earlier on his . show, Maradona compared FIFA’s punishment to sending Suarez to . Guantanamo Bay in handcuffs. ‘The FIFA sanction is shameful,’ he . said. ‘It is a way of punishing Uruguayan clubs for asking the South . American federation for a fairer share of money. It hurts that they have . cut short the career of a lad who is a winner. It’s an excessive . suspension and FIFA cannot talk about morals to anyone. ‘A player works hard the whole year to be able to play at the World Cup and they kick him out like this. It’s unbelievable. ‘Remember . Zinedine Zidane and what he did in the 2006 World Cup final? FIFA then . gave him the Golden Ball. In this World Cup there have been much greater . incidents than Suarez’s. He didn’t kill anyone. This is an unjust . punishment, the act of an incredible mafia.’ Maradona’s guest was . Uruguayan president Jose Mujica, who had earlier made a wasted journey . to Carrasco International Airport outside Montevideo, where Suarez was . expected to return. That the head of state should wish to welcome . home a footballer ejected from the World Cup for biting an opponent . affords some insight into the skewed Uruguayan mentality over this. Mujica looks like a much-loved grandpa and has modern, liberal, . left-wing views on gay marriage, abortion and wealth distribution, but . he knows how to work a crowd, too. Home support: A Uruguayan displays a banner reading: 'FIFA corrupt. We support you Luisito' Biting wit: Tourists joke in front of an advert on the Copacabana . He gives 90 per cent of his . salary to charity and has refused to move from a one-bedroom farmhouse . to the palace that comes with his office. This makes him one of the most . enlightened political leaders on any continent, but not immune to the . odd act of pure populism. The gathering at Carrasco Airport . included fans  with banners and large cardboard cut-outs of Suarez’s . face, some with false vampire teeth, celebrating an act that should . provoke only revulsion. Mujica instinctively knew on which side his . bread was buttered. ‘We feel that this is an assault on the poor,’ Mujica said. ‘This gang will not forgive Suarez because he never went to . university, he isn’t educated, he grew up on the field, he is a natural . rebel and expresses his anger naturally. ‘We have seen all the . games and this is a different punishment. This is the most indignant . punishment. Here they add everything together but the boy really . shouldn’t be blamed. It’s a match and these things happen. There’s no . need to look into every incident, because if we did that in each game . we’d play five-a-side.’ Iconic figure: Suarez has become one of the lasting memories of this World Cup . Leaving a mark: A young Suarez fan poses with vampire teeth at Carrasco International Airport . Of course, there are plenty of working-class . people in Latin America who go through a considerably more impoverished . life than Suarez is experiencing without biting anybody, but Uruguay is . in no mood for logic or social realism right now. They are the . victims here, the tiny nation of three million — ‘tres miliones de . ilusiones… vamos  Uruguay!’ it says on the team bus, which translates as . ‘Three million dreams … let’s go Uruguay’ —  that has been conspired . against by the superpowers of England, Italy and FIFA. Do they have a . point? Not really. There is no way FIFA could look at this incident in . isolation, considering the recidivism in Suarez’s behaviour, meaning . wider comparisons are inappropriate. Yet they are being made, . constantly. One debate concerns the case of Josip Simunic of Croatia, . banned for 10 international games — but not from all football — for . using the Nazi inspired ‘Za dom spremni!’ chant after Croatia’s win over . Iceland. ‘Not as bad as Suarez?’ it was asked on Brazilian . television. Yet equivalency can be used to pick holes in any . sanction: certainly when, to the banner-wavers, the apologists and . Suarez simpaticos, the only correct punishment is no punishment at all.","Diego Maradona has publicly backed Luis Suarez following his FIFA ban .

"Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel said Wednesday that the problem of 'foreign fighters' aiding the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) includes far more Americans than has been previously reported – at least 100 and counting. 'We have acknowledged publicly we are aware of over 100 U.S. citizens who have U.S. passports who are fighting in the Middle East with ISIL forces,' he said during a televised interview. 'There may be more. We don't know.' Earlier estimates had only about a dozen so-called 'foreign fighters' from the United States scattered across the Middle East in ISIS army units. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Chuck Hagel said more than 100 Americans are fighting in the Middle East alongside ISIS militants, a dramatic uptick from previous estimates of about a dozen . Foreign fighter: Abdirahmaan Muhumed, pictured in Syria, was killed while fighting for ISIS. He had access to planes at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport before he joined the Islamist terror group . A few have been killed on the battlefield, including 29-year-old Somali-American Abdirahmaan Muhumed, was employed cleaning jetliners for Delta Airlines before he left the U.S. to fight for the terror group. Another, Douglas McArthur McCain, was killed in Syria weeks ago. It emerged later that he was a close friend of another foreign fighter, Troy Kastigar, who was killed in 2009 after joining the al-Shabab terror network in Somalia. All three hailed from the Minneapolis, Minnesota area, in an area with a concentrated Muslim population and at least one mosque tied to radical anti-American ideology. The New York Times reported six days ago that according to American intelligence and law enforcement agencies, 'nearly a dozen Americans' had traveled to Syria to fight for ISIS. The Economist magazine put the number at 70 on Tuesday, citing a mishmash of statistics from the International Monetary Fund, the London-based International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence, and the New York-based Soufan Group. But hard numbers have been hard to come by, and Hagel's admission sheds new light on the size of the problem. U.S. officials have warned that Americans who could use their passports to bring the ISIS fight back home pose one of the greatest homeland security threats to the United States since the 9/11 al-Qaeda attacks in 2001. Speaking Tuesday at the White House, Obama's chief spokesman said that the U.S. officials 'have been focused on countering the threat' for months. 'The Department of State in March appointed Ambassador Robert Bradtke as senior adviser for partner engagement on Syria foreign fighters,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters. 'So there’s been an intensive diplomatic effort to coordinate our efforts to confront and mitigate this threat. There’s been significant operational collaboration between DHS, FBI and all of their foreign counterparts, including Interpol, on this effort. President Obama drew criticism Wednesday in Estonia for backing off of his resolve to 'destroy' ISIS with a weaker pledge to make it 'manageable' Douglas McArthur McCain (left), who died fighting for ISIS in Syria this year, was a high school pal of Troy Kastigar (right), who died fighting for al-Shabab in Somalia in 2009 . Hagel said Wednesday that with so many American passport-holders able to re-enter the U.S. after joining the ISIS jihad, 'we can't take a chance ... on saying, ""Well, let's technically define this. Is it a real threat today or tomorrow?""' He reiterated the resolve of U.S. officials including President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry to wipe the Islamist terror group off the map. America's mission in Iraq, Hagel said on CNN, is 'not ""contain."" It’s exactly what the president said: ""degrade and destroy"".' Obama caught flak on Wednesday morning in Estonia for waffling between hard-line and soft-pedal positions on the Islamist group that has cut a wide and deadly swath through massive portions of eastern Syria and northern Iraq. The primary U.S. objective 'is to degrade and destroy' ISIS 'so that it’s no longer a threat not just to Iraq but also the region and to the United States,' the president said during a press conference. But minutes later he said a successful American effort in the region would 'shrink' the group's 'sphere of influence, its effectiveness, its financing, its military capabilities to the point where it is a manageable problem.' Obama arrived at RAF Fairford in Gloucestershire, England on Wednesday ahead of a NATO summit . The president was greeted by an American entourage led by U.S. Ambassador to the UK Matthew Barzun . Missouri Republican Sen. Roy Blunt was among the lawmakers who lashed out later in the day. 'Terrorists who behead Americans are not ""manageable,"" Blunt said in a statement. 'They must be stopped, and we need President Obama to communicate a clear strategy and goals on how he plans to eliminate this threat.' Hagel, meanwhile, clung to Obama's first statement while ignoring the second. 'You've got to destroy it,' he said of ISIS, 'because if we don't destroy it, it will get worse.' The soft-spoken defense secretary stopped short of offering any guarantees, however. 'Vows are something beyond my mortal capacity of doing,' he said. 'We will do everything possible that we can do to destroy their capacity to inflict harm on our people and Western values and our interests.' The Pentagon will achieve the White House's strategic objectives, Hagel explained, by cooking up a menu of tactical options for Obama to choose from. Steven Sotloff (left) was beheaded in a gruesome video distributed by ISIS this week, following a heart-rending videotaped appeal to the terror group's leaders last week from his mother (right) 'Our mission,' he said, 'is to provide him those options and those plans to accomplish the mission of ""destroy and degrade"" the capability of ISIS.' And speaking of the growing number of Americans who have taken up arms against U.S. interests and allies in the Middle East, he conceded that 'this crowd is a dangerous crowd.' 'This crowd is as dangerous a group of people – beyond just terrorists – they are an army,' he said, 'marrying this with an ideology and a capacity to do things.' 'They control half of Iraq today. They control half of Syria today. We better be taking them seriously.' Obama will lead a UN Security Council meeting this month devoted to the question of how to handle foreign fighters and whether to restrict their movements. British Prime Minister David Cameron has called for new anti-terrorism powers to limit their access to the UK and determine where they can and can't go. Kerry said earlier in the day that American might would pursue the killers of two American journalists whose beheadings were captured on video and spread globally through social media. '[T]hose who have murdered James Foley and Steven Sotloff in Syria,' he vowed, 'should know that the United States will hold them accountable too, no matter how long it takes.'","US defense secretary hints that a growing number of Americans are taking up arms with jihadi army in Iraq and Syria – more than 100, up from just a dozen estimated a week ago .

"High profile: Cheryl Hines and Robert F Kennedy Jr at the Riverkeeper Annual Fishermen's Ball in New York last month . Robert Kennedy Jr's girlfriend boasted about their relationship online in the weeks leading up to his estranged wife's suicide. Actress Cheryl Hines posted Twitter messages that showed she had all but taken the place of Mary Richardson Kennedy, who hanged herself last week. The Curb Your Enthusiasm star, 46, had appeared on Mr Kennedy's arm at galas and events held by Riverkeeper, the environmental protection group of which he is vice chairman. And her tweets suggested she had also become close with two of Mrs Kennedy's best friends, sister-in-law Kerry Kennedy and the actress Glenn Close. As the New York Post reports, she even told her followers about how she had been talking about sport with the Kennedys' youngest son Aiden. A post from February 5 read: 'Rabid, unhinged New England zealotry by 10-yr.-old Aidan Kennedy has nearly turned me into Pats fan.' Ms Hines deleted her Twitter account around the time of Mrs Kennedy's death - but by then the messages had already been archived by social media search engine Topsy. While the actress was proudly telling the world about her new life with her boyfriend - the lawyer son of assassinated senator Robert F Kennedy - he remained embroiled in a bitter, drawn-out divorce case with his ex after they split in spring 2010. Mrs Kennedy, 52, was struggling with debt and depression before she was found dead at her home in Bedford, New York. These are the pictures which likely sent Mary over the edge  as it appeared Cheryl Hines was trying to hijack her life by growing close to her children, left, and even boasting about her friendship with Glenn Close, below . Moving on: A picture posted on Twitter of Mr Kennedy and Ms Hines at the birthday party of actress Glenn Close (left), a close friend of Mary Kennedy . According to the Post, documents show she was facing a $32,000 lawsuit from American Express, though this was dropped following her death. She was said to have found it 'humiliating' when her husband and children appeared with Ms Hines at the Riverkeeper Annual Fisherman's Ball last month. The blonde sitcom star also went with Mr Kennedy, 58, to Glenn Close's birthday party on April 15. Mrs Close had been firm friends with Mrs Kennedy and even sang at her funeral on Saturday. Meeting the family: Cheryl Hines with Robert F Kennedy Jr and his mother Ethel, as well as former Vice President Al Gore (left) at an awards dinner in December . A photo posted to Twitter by Mr Kennedy's close friend and sister-in-law Kerry, who introduced Mrs Kennedy to her future husband, showed a grinning Mrs Close side-by-side with Mr Kennedy and his girlfriend. Public appearance: The couple with Kathleen, Mr Kennedy's daughter from his first marriage . That same day, Ms Hines bragged: 'I got to tell #GlenClose what an inspiration she has always been to me.' It came shortly after she tweeted about visiting a restaurant where Mrs Kennedy used to take her children. The post read: 'At Armonk’s Burgers & Shakes in Armonk, NY. So, sooooo good.' Then, on April 28, Kerry Kennedy posted a picture of the couple eating with singer Jackson Browne after an education fundraiser, along with the message: 'Cheryl and Jackson were amazing on stage and off.' A spokeswoman for Ms Hines said the actress's 'thoughts and prayers are with the family'. Earlier this week tensions between Mr Kennedy and his late wife's relatives resulted in the Richardson family holding their own private memorial service after all but one of them stayed away from the funeral he arranged. The service in New York City followed a legal dispute in which Mrs Kennedy's brother Thomas Richardson, a lawyer, tried to stop her estranged husband claiming her body. But the judge ruled in Mr Kennedy's favour, also awarding him full custody of his children and the whole of their mother's $4million estate. After just one of the Richardson siblings attended the funeral on Saturday, other family members and friends arranged a 'celebration' of Mrs Kennedy's life at The Standard Hotel in Manhattan. At the 200-strong memorial, there was no talk of demons or sadness but only the 'light and love that Mary brought into a room'. Her widower was not invited, and took their four children Conor, 18, Kyra, 17, Finn, 15, and Aiden, 11 to stay with their grandmother in Florida. At the funeral on Saturday, Robert delivered a tearful eulogy which seemed to distance himself from any blame in Mary's suicide, saying she had a 'sadness that kicked her and chased her'. He also said that his late wife suffered from depression long before her 1994 marriage and keery Kennedy said 'she struggled from the time I met her when she was 15'. But Mary's close friends dispute this. 'Battling demons? That's hyperbolic language,' Carole Radziwill told People magazine. 'I didn't see anything close to that. 'She truly believed in the goodness of people. In the end that was her undoing.' Another friend said: 'Mary did not have a history of depression. She became a troubled person because of the divorce.'

Having just celebrated his 86th birthday alongside his 35-year-old wife, Trina, Edwin remains a respected and beloved figure in Louisiana's colorful culture.This powerful and legendary figure in Louisiana politics just wants to kick back and make his wife happy. Trina Edwards is a young, fun and beautiful 35-year-old woman best known as Edwin Edward's third wife. After reading his biography while he was incarcerated, she initiated a pen pal relationship with Edwin while he was in jail, which quickly turned romantic. Married a year after Edwin was released from prison, the newly minted 'Mrs. Edwards' works hard to rehabilitate her gold-digger reputation and cement her place on the social scene, much to the dismay of her stepdaughters, who are almost twice her age. Their show was originally set to debut this February, but was delayed 'due to new events in the family's lives.' The show aims to exploit the drama of the blended family and showcase how Edwards is picking up the pieces from the political shenanigans that landed him in prison. The disgraced Democrat served four terms as Governor of the Bayou State and also served in Congress. He was known for his charisma in politics but was sentenced to prison on racketeering charges in 2001. He was in jail from 2002 to January 2011 for his role in a bribery and extortion scheme to rig riverboat casino licenses during his fourth term in the early 1990s.

'I was in the last year of my prison term…and after she read the book, she became interested in my career and asked to visit me. And I arranged for her to visit me and after that we got to know each other well and she came to visit me every visiting day thereafter. 'And that’s an unusual story for a man my age and a beautiful young woman her age,' Edwards continued. 'But thank goodness it happened. They sent me to prison for life, look what I came back, a good-looking wife.' May-December romance: The love match began when he was in prison and she was his pen pal .

Both Trina and Edwin admit their story is 'unique,' but insist their relationship works for them. 'My husband is an amazing husband,' Trina Edwards said. 'He’s a wonderful father. Our marriage is better than most people’s marriage when they’re the same age.' 'I don’t know how it happened or why it happened but I absolutely fell in love with him,” Trina said. “And besides that, he doesn’t have as much money as most people think. So I’d be a pretty poor gold digger if that’s what I was in for.' Trina Scott married Edwin Edwards in July 2011. She is Edwards' third wife. They welcomed a son, Eli, this August.

Scott also has two teenage boys, Trevor and Logan, from a previous marriage who will also be included in the reality program. 'People are going to be surprised at how normal in most respects our lives are,' the former Governor said. 'And given, in spite of the fact that . there’s this great difference in our age, the fact that I have 4 . children over 55-years-old and now a 3-month-old baby and she’s got two . teenage boys. A situation that the average person, not knowing or having . been with us would raise his or her eyebrows and say that’s never going . to work but believe me it has worked and I’m very proud of it.'

"Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal is planning to give several of the club’s homegrown youngsters a chance to play alongside Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao this season as the Old Trafford outfit fight to safeguard their reputation as the custodians of youth. United’s hierarchy have been dismayed by the criticism aimed at them following their deadline day move for Colombian striker Falcao and exits of England internationals Danny Welbeck and Tom Cleverley, who both came through the academy ranks. Sir Alex Ferguson’s former No 2 Mike Phelan claimed: ‘Danny Welbeck has been part of United’s identity and that has been broken.’ Scroll down for video . High hopes: United are expecting big things from young striker James Wilson . Bright futures: Tyler Blackett and Sam Johnstone are among the youngster in the first-team picture . However, United insist youngsters like Tyler Blackett, Reece James, James Wilson and Sam Johnstone will be part of their first-team squad this season, with Jesse Lingard joining them when he returns from a leg injury sustained on the opening day. United have a proud record of having at least one home-grown player in every first-team squad since 1937 and are determined that will not be broken under Van Gaal, who earned a reputation at Ajax and Barcelona for giving young players their chance, including Clarence Seedorf, Patrick Kluivert and Andres Iniesta. Senior sources at United say despite their £190million spending spree in 2014, their strategy — sanctioned by Van Gaal — is to build a team of the best players in the world and youngsters who have come through United’s system. New arrival: Radamel Falcao has been brought in to help fire United back into the top four . National service: Angel di Maria in action for Argentina this week . A record £60m was paid for Di Maria in the summer transfer window with big fees also splashed out on Marcos Rojo, who on Thursday received his long-awaited work permit, Ander Herrera, Luke Shaw and Daley Blind. Juan Mata signed for £38m in January and is still part of Van Gaal’s plans. Of the current crop of United youngsters, 18-year-old striker Wilson is seen as the best prospect — alongside Adnan Januzaj, 19 — and scored twice on his first-team debut under interim manager Ryan Giggs last season. Defender Blackett and James, both 20, and 21-year-old goalkeeper Johnstone are also the latest kids to come off the production line at a club famed for their Busby Babes and Class of ’92. Shaw, 19, should also return soon from a hamstring injury after his £27m move from Southampton. Man with a plan: United boss Louis van Gaal will use a blend of experience and youth . As reported in Wednesday’s Sportsmail, United will give Van Gaal more funds in January as they try to challenge to get back into the top four after last season’s disappointing seventh-place finish under David Moyes. Roma midfielder Kevin Strootman is a £25m target and a top central defender is also needed, although Borussia Dortmund’s Mats Hummels remains off limits unless the German club are knocked out of European competition early. United have failed to win any of their opening three league games but received some good news for their next fixture when Argentinian World Cup defender Rojo, 24, was granted a work permit following his £16m summer move from Sporting Lisbon. He will be available to face QPR on Sunday week. Fellow Argentinian Di Maria did not have to go through the process as he holds an Italian passport through a grandparent.

"In the chaos of a burning building, a firefighter's senses are crucial. When smoke clouds the air, picking up on the roar of flames, the creak of collapsing floors, radio calls and cries for help can be the difference between life and death. But one young recruit must do without such signs of danger - as he is deaf and cannot speak. Joseph Ronan, 21, graduated from a first-stage firefighter training programme earlier this month and will soon begin volunteering at his local department in West Haven, Connecticut. Scroll down for video . Suiting up: Deaf firefighter Joseph Ronan gets ready for another day tackling blazes in West Haven, Connecticut . 'I like to help the community and prove the deaf community can do anything,' he told The New Haven Register, speaking in sign language as his mother Debra and friend Ashley Melendez interpreted. Mr Ronan was born deaf, but his condition was not picked up until he was eight months old, when his family noticed he was not responding to sounds around him. Doctors soon diagnosed him with a genetic disorder called Waardenburg syndrome. But even disability could not keep the young boy from harbouring ambitions of joining the fire service - a dream he is now days away from realising. His mother told reporters how he had idolised firefighters when he was as young as four, and how he used to spend his nights watching documentaries about his heroes. Challenge: Mr Ronan can communicate only through sign language and needed interpreters during his training . Mr Ronan spent much of his education in mainstream schools, though he later enrolled at the American School for the Deaf. After graduating at the age of 19 he spent a few months at a community college, but none of the courses offered there could compare to his true calling. Soon he began turning up to monthly meetings at the North End Hose Co. 3 fire station, where government interpreters from the Bureau of Rehabilitation Services helped him find out how he could be a part of the team. In January he began classes with the fire school, learning all about the tricks and tools of the trade, from ladders to hoses, hazmat suits to search and rescue operations. Before long he was out on training exercises, charging bravely into concrete buildings filled with blazing hay and helping to extinguish the flames. 'I went to watch him one day and I was like, ""Oh Lord"". I was thinking he’s crazy,' his mother, Debra, told the Register. 'I was very proud to watch him. He was really focused, and I was really happy to see how the class kind of all came around him to help him learn how to work inside of a fire. I was really proud to watch him doing such a, to me, scary thing.' Language barrier: The young rookie is teaching his fellow firefighters to sign so they can communicate more easily on callouts . Determined: Mr Ronan has dreamed of being a firefighter since the age of four . In training, Mr Ronan benefited from the support of his fellow students, who would tell him which way to turn by tapping his left or right leg, or tap the ladder to tell him to lift it. Now his colleagues at the station hope to take this team spirit to the next level by learning how to communicate with Mr Ronan through sign language. He will be working under district chief James O'Brien, who praised the rookie firefighter for his determination and independent spirit. Together they will figure out the limitations on Mr Ronan's duties, and exactly how he will be able to help on callouts. Though he now holds a certificate for the first stage of training, his disability means the state authorities refuse to let him work as a fully-fledged, paid crew member. Base: Mr Ronan will join as a volunteer at the North End Hose Co. 3 fire station, in West Haven, Connecticut . Mr Ronan expects he will be able to help out with car crashes, handling hazardous materials, giving first aid and putting out brush, tree and grass fires. Even though he will not be allowed to enter burning buildings, he will pitch in with vital support work from the outside, setting up safety equipment, hooking up fire hydrants and handling the crew's oxygen tanks. Surprisingly, he is not alone in facing this unusual challenge and said he knows of a few other deaf or hearing-impaired volunteer firefighters working in Connecticut. Mr Ronan wanted to thank the teachers and classmates who helped him towards qualification, while his proud father Sean pointed out what an achievement passing the training course had been - especially as only 21 of 30 students graduated. According to Jamie Vincent, director of the fire school, Mr Ronan's disability is not as much of an impediment as it may seem. He told the Register: 'The instructors and students alike all said it doesn’t make a difference if you’re deaf or blind: You can’t see or hear anything inside a burning building anyway, so it basically made everyone level.'","Rookie Joseph Ronan, 21, has been unable to hear or speak since birth .

"Smartphones are being turned into ‘pocket doctors’ capable of spotting Parkinson’s disease. The popular devices come equipped with technology needed to record speech and movement – both of which are eroded by the condition, Britain’s biggest science conference heard. The information can then be analysed and, it is hoped, used to diagnose the disease earlier and more accurately. More prompt treatment should improve quality of life. A patient’s symptoms could also be tracked over time, ‘revolutionising’ treatment by allowing doctors to adjust drug dosage as needed. A new smartphone app can help diagnose Parkinson's disease - suffered by Muhammad Ali and Michael J Fox (pictured) - by recording speech and movement, both of which are eroded by the condition . More studies are needed but British researchers have already shown they distinguish Parkinson’s patients from healthy people with almost 100 per cent accuracy – and they are in negotiation about using the technology on the NHS. Some 127,000 Britons suffer from Parkinson’s but with diagnosis based on symptoms, it is often not confirmed until relatively late. Once it is diagnosed, fluctuations in the severity of symptoms make it difficult adjust drug doses. High-profile sufferers include Michael J Fox, who was just 30 when he was diagnosed with the condition, and Muhammad Ali. Comedian Robin Williams was in the early stages of Parkinson’s when he died last month. Symptoms include tremors, stiffness and a gradual slowing down of the body. As more and more brain cells die, speech and balance can be affected and some sufferers become wheelchair-bound. There is no cure but early treatment improves quality of life. The ‘pocket doctor’, unveiled at the British Science Festival in Birmingham, is simply a normal smartphone. Aston University mathematician Dr Max Little has shown it is possible to use voice recordings to spot Parkinson’s with 99 per cent accuracy. Give-aways include soft, breathy speech and a tremor to the voice. The team has also used the phone’s accelerometer - the inbuilt motion sensor that ensures the information on the screen faces the right way – to log movement. This is important, as Parkinson’s patients often freeze while walking. Dr Little told the British Science Festival in Birmingham: ‘We have been able to show that if someone puts the smartphone in their pocket and walks forward 20 paces and back we can get very high accuracy – around 98 per cent or so – in detecting whether someone has Parkinson’s.’ The actor Robin Williams, 63, pictured in July this year, was also in the early stages of Parkinson's disease. The scientists behind the new app say voice recordings can diagnose the disease with 99 per cent accuracy . He hopes that if he can study enough people, it will eventually be possible to detect the disease in its early stages. Dr Little said: ‘We don’t know how to diagnose the disease until in essence it is too late. If we could get an advantage of even five years, that would be great.’ Possibilities range from a program that is only used by doctors to an app that the general public can use, although the ethics of this would have to be examined. It is hoped the gadgetry found in smartphones could also be used to help spot other conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease, anxiety and depression. Claire Bale of charity Parkinson’s UK, which is helping fund Dr Little’s work, said: ‘This research is a welcome step forward. 'Parkinson’s is a very complex and fluctuating condition – so effectively managing it is a real challenge. ‘Smartphones offer huge potential as they continuously capture information, and can monitor subtle changes - such as an increase or decrease in someone’s tremor. ‘Arming doctors and people with Parkinson’s with this technology could revolutionise the way the condition is managed.'","Experts at Aston University said the 'pocket doctor' makes it possible to use voice recordings to spot the disease with 99 per cent accuracy .

"West Brom chairman Jeremy Peace has called for the transfer window to be moved. The Baggies chief believes it would be beneficial to clubs if the window closed before the start of the season. But Peace knows a change is unlikely to happen with the Premier League reluctant to make the switch. Astute: Jeremy Peace was happy with West Brom's transfer business but wants the window closed earlier . 'If you spoke to the other clubs in the Premier League they would all say it's not ideal,' he told the Wolverhampton Express & Star . 'We are all the same in our little league. 'My ideal would be that you get your squad done and start playing and the window shuts, then you all know where you stand. Record signing: Brown Ideye was signed for a whopping £10m as the Baggies reinforced their forward line . 'No player thinks that they might be moving and thinking they'd better not get injured. 'And players would not be coming to you saying they're not in the right frame of mind. 'We have raised it with the Premier League and said 'close the transfer window at the start of the season'. 'But they mention the League Cup, the FA Cup, no winter break, the fact that World Cups and European Championships eat into the window. Star signing: Argentine international Sebastian Blanco became West Brom's 11th signing of the summer . 'All of these things mean we can't do it so we're stuck with it as it is and everybody has got the same set of problems. 'If we could do it I would certainly be in favour because it would remove a whole load of uncertainty during the season. 'You try to get things done as early as possible but you can't. People talk about not doing anything until after the World Cup.' Albion brought in 11 new players, including record £10m striker Brown Ideye, as head coach Alan Irvine rebuilt the squad after they narrowly escaped the drop under Pepe Mel last season. And Peace insists he is happy with the Baggies' business since during the summer. He added: 'In a way we have had a major sea-change in the last three months because we wanted to draw a line under what had gone on last season and almost reboot it, start all over again. 'We have tried to get the right type of player in terms of not only the way they play but also the type of characters involved to take us forward.'","Jeremy Peace said that all Premier League clubs believe it's not ideal .

"Owner: Neighbour Garfield King outside his home . The owner of a Staffordshire bull terrier which ripped off a toddler's ear and nose has astonishingly blamed the boy's parents for not keeping a closer eye on him. Two-year-old Keiron Guess is in a coma today after being rushed to hospital with horrendous injuries. He was playing outside his house in Swindon, Wiltshire, when his neighbour's dog savaged him. But Garfield King, the dog's owner, said: ‘If you’re a parent you have to look after your children 24 hours a day. If it wasn’t a dog it could have been a paedophile.’ Garfield's son Jonathan went face-to-face with Dave Guess, during a heated confrontation near their houses today. The toddler had seven hours of . emergency reconstructive surgery and his parents, Stacey, 22, and . Anthony, 23, have been at his bedside. It emerged today that he has been able to squeeze the hands of loved ones as he . continues to recover from his horrific injuries. The toddler was able to respond after medics began reducing his coma - but doctors have stressed he is still at risk. Carl Drury, Keiron’s great uncle, said: 'He is stable but they . have said he is not out of the woods yet and there is a long way to go. 'They did reduce the coma slightly last night and he responded by squeezing fingers.' The youngster was saved by his grandfather, who was . also injured but has been left breathing with the aid of a ventilator. Today Kieron's grandfather Dave Guess, who rescued him from the dog, said the family were too frightened to return home. Despite the out of control dog being destroyed, there is still another one living at the neighbour's house. ‘It would be hard for Keiron to come back here after what has gone on - he would be terrified,' said Dave. ‘Something needs to be done. We still don’t know whether the owner will be allowed to keep his other dog yet. Confrontation: Jonathan King, (left) the eldest son of dog owner Garfield King clashes with Dave Guess, grandfather of dog attack victim Kieron Guess today . ‘But this should never have happened in the first place - the dog had bitten people, including a police officer, and other dogs before. ‘It just does not seem right that no-one will be prosecuted - I saw my grandson get ripped to pieces by that dog. He has massive scars across his face.’ Keiron’s family believe the youngster may have wandered through an open gate into the property, from an alleyway next to their home. A Staffordshire bull terrier called ‘Ratty’ - believed to be owned by Rastafarian Garfield King - then set upon the child, savaging his face with its giant jaws. Dave, describing what he saw when he got to the child seconds later, said: ‘He was ripping him to pieces - Keiron was a mess. Wound: Dave Guess shows the injuries he sustained while trying to rescue his grandson Kieron Guess. The child is still in hospital . Anger: Jonathan King (left) said he had travelled from London to defend his father's reputation as he clashed with Dave Guess today . ‘The dog owner was holding Keiron up but the dog was just jumping up and biting him. ‘I took Keiron off him, put him on my shoulders, and ran back into the alleyway. I was getting bitten by the dog but eventually managed to get Keiron safe.’ The toddler was rushed to Frenchay Hospital in Bristol, where he underwent seven hours of reconstructive surgery. Doctors reconstructed part of his nose, putting metal plates in his face, and tried to rebuild his left ear - which had been completely severed. Garfield's son Jonathan King said as he clashed with Dave Guess: ‘I have come up from London to defend my dad. He is in a bad way at the moment - he has grandkids himself. Victim: Kieren Guess suffered horrific facial injuries in the attack . Aggression: Two pit bull-style dogs seen leaping up at Shovell King's house near to where Keiron was attacked . ‘We are very apologetic to the family of the child - he is the most important thing right now. But the dogs were in the garden and the child has strayed into the garden.’ Kieron's other grandfather said the boy was 'on the mend'. Doctors . have been tentatively waking the youngster and letting him move around . before returning him to his slumber but there are still fears he may . suffer an infection. Grandfather Shaun Leonard said: 'His parents have gone up to hospital again today. 'He’s on the mend I think and he’s starting to move. They are waking him up, letting him move and putting him back down. Mauled: The boy is being treated at Frenchay Hospital in Bristol, where he has undergone surgery . 'Keiron’s . got swelling on his face but its starting to go down. The doctors are . saying they don’t want him to get an infection. They are also saying . he’s got fluid on his lungs - it’s a bit of blood but that’s . understandable after what he’s been through. 'Everything we hear now is just a worry.' Mr Leonard said the boy was playing in a lane behind the family home at 6pm on Sunday when the dog burst out of Mr King’s back . yard. Mr Leonard said: ‘The dog took his left ear off and bit off most of his nose. His left eye was hanging out. ‘He has injuries from his forehead . right down to his chin. There were holes in his face. The dog also took a . chunk out of the back of his head.’ Keiron’s 49-year-old paternal grandfather, David Guess, heard his screams and raced to help. Scene: An alleyway behind Swanage Walk in Swindon, where the attack happened in June . Horror: The attack happened while Keiron was being looked after by his grandfather in Swanage Walk (above) Mr Leonard, a lorry driver, continued: . ‘He managed to pull Keiron on to his shoulders but the dog was still . jumping up at him. It just kept coming back for more.’ His 22-year-old mother, who is . pregnant and has another son, Kenzie aged four, with her 23-year-old . scaffolder husband, wrote on Facebook: ‘Just waiting for my gorgeous . baby. Just want to hold you in our arms.’ Mr . King, whose son owned the dog, was watching the Diamond Jubilee . celebrations in his end of terrace redbrick home when the canine entered . the garden and sunk its teeth into the youngster’s head. ‘All of a sudden the dog went outside. I heard squeaking and then I had to go outside to check on the dog,' he said. ‘The dog was looking like he was . playing with something. I thought the neighbours had thrown a dolly over . the fence but then I saw it wasn’t a dolly because I saw all the blood. I’m still in shock now.’ However, . Mr King was unapologetic talking at his home, lined with Buddhist . ornaments and African drums, saying the parents should have been . watching over their son. Panic: The boy's grandfather was also hurt as he tried to pull the animal away during the horrific incident in Swanage Walk . Wiltshire Police said the dog was due . to be destroyed yesterday but no arrests had been made. In September . last year, a police team raided Mr King’s address, and an officer was . bitten by a dog after the  animal had been Tasered. It is believed that the police officer who went to the house after the . mauling of Keiron was the same police officer who was bitten on the hand by the dog last year. During the raid a local newspaper . photographer took a photograph of two dogs jumping at the glass door. It . is not known if the picture features the dog which attacked Keiron. After the raid, Police Constable Mark Giles from . Wiltshire Police said: ‘The owner was trying to  control the two of them . but they were trying to fight each other and get at us. ‘I had to deploy my Taser to try to prevent them from attacking but one leapt up and bit me even after I hit it in the mouth.’ Under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991, if a . dog bites someone while on its owner’s property, police are not . required to take action unless the injury is severe or the dog is . thought to be a danger to others.","Kieron Guess is in an induced coma and could be left partially blind after one of his eyes was left 'hanging out', according to relatives .

"Sotloff's family have paid tribute to a thoughtful man who enjoyed simple pleasures . Flags will fly at half-mast  in Florida today, where the family of beheaded US journalist Steven Sotloff lives. Sotloff, 31, was beheaded by Islamic State militants in a video released Tuesday, two weeks after the similar video of U.S. journalist James Foley was posted online. 'In honor and in memory of Steven Sotloff, I hereby direct the flags of the United States and the state of Florida to be flown at half-staff at all local and state buildings, installations, and grounds throughout the state of Florida,' Governor Rick Scott said in a statement. An afternoon service is being held at Temple Beth Am in Sotloff's hometown of Pinecrest which Rabbi Terry Bookman says is open to the public. Sotloff attended the Temple Beth Am school as a child and his mother Shirley Sotloff still teaches preschool there. Sotloff was kidnapped April 4, 2013 in Aleppo near the Turkish border, but his abduction was kept secret after his family requested a media blackout. He was a freelance reporter who had written for Time magazine, Foreign Policy and other outlets. His family have paid tribute to the slain journalist, remembering him as a thoughtful man who enjoyed simple pleasures and was fascinated by the Middle East. They described him as ‘a gentle soul’ who ‘tried to find good in a world of darkness’ in a statement released on Wednesday afternoon. Barak Barfi, a spokesperson for the Sotloff family, wept as he spoke to reporters in front of the family's home in Miami. He described Sotloff as someone who was ‘torn between two poles’, who ‘yearned for a tranquil life’, but who was also pulled by the Arab world. Sotloff was ‘no war junkie’, he said, but someone who ‘merely wanted to give a voice to those who have none.' ‘From the Libyan doctor in Misrata who struggled to provide psychological services to children ravaged by war, to the Syrian plumber who risked his life by crossing regime lines to purchase medicine, their story was Steve’s story. Scroll down for video . Candlelight vigils have been held across Florida in memory of slain journalist Steven Sotloff . 'He ultimately sacrificed his life to bring their story to the world, said Barfi, one of the dead man's closest friends and a research fellow at the New America Foundation. Sotloff's death was announced in a video entitled, 'A Second Message to America', in which the journalist appears in an orange jumpsuit before he is beheaded by an ISIS fighter. The executioner is believed to be the same man who killed Foley - 'Jihadi John' - and speaks to the camera saying, 'I'm back, Obama, and I'm back because of your arrogant foreign policy towards the Islamic State.' He then threatens to kill a British hostage next. President Barak Obama said that the prayers of the American people are with the family of the 'devoted and courageous journalist' Mr Sotloff, who deeply loved the Islamic world and whose 'life stood in stark contrast to those who murdered him so brutally.'","Governor announced symbol of mourning in Florida, where Sotloff family live .

"Many smartwatches track exercise and calories, but now a new wristband allows parents to keep tabs on their children. The wearable phone and GPS tracker is designed to be worn by children and allows them to call their parents. It is thought that Tinitell will be among the smallest commercial mobile phones on the market when it launches and will be operated through the click of a button or via voice recognition. Scroll down for video . No more lost kids! The Tinitell wearable phone and GPS tracker (pictured) is designed to be worn by children and allows them to make calls as well as enabling their movements to be tracked by parents . The watch is designed to be practical for playtime and does not have a delicate screen. Instead, it has a large button to select a function and will use voice recognition to allow children to a particular contact. If a child were to say ‘mum’ the watch will call the assigned number linked to a pre-recorded voice label. Children will be able to search for contacts manually using volume keys on the side of the watch to access other numbers. More advanced features will be controlled by parents via an accompanying smartphone app, which they will be able to use to see the location of their children on a map, as the watch has built-in GPS. Small design for tiny hands: Tinitell is thought to be the smallest commercial mobile phone on the market and can be operated through the click of a button or via voice recognition . There's an app for that: Advanced watch features are controlled by parents via an accompanying smartphone app, which they can be used to see the location of their children on a map (pictured) and call them too .

If a child were to say ‘mum’ the watch will call the assigned number linked to a pre-recorded voice label. Children will be able to search for contacts manually using volume keys to access other numbers when it goes on sale. More advanced features will be controlled by parents via an accompanying smartphone app, which they will be able to use to see the location of their children on a map as the watch has built-in GPS. It is available to pre-order on Kickstarter for an early bird price of $99 (£52). While the watch is not completely waterproof, it is splash proof and can withstand quick dips in water. Tinitell was created by Mats Horn in Stockholm, who came up with the idea in 2012 while hanging out with a friend who is also a father. He is now raising money on Kickstarter to put his invention into production and is approximately half way to reaching his goal after pulling in just under $60,000 (£35,530). Tinitell is available to pre-order on Kickstarter for early backers for $99 (£52) and is expected to be sold later for $179 (£106). It is common for children to take mobile phones to school, but smartphones are expensive and can be lost easily. Mr Horn said his friend’s son wanted to go outside and play but didn’t have a smartphone. ‘He had lost a cell phone once before . and we didn’t feel like lending out our smartphones. Worst of all, we . couldn’t join him outside because we were busy cooking dinner. His son . ended up playing in his room with his iPad, and I thought that was sad.’ The watch (pictured) comes in four colours and is designed to be practical. It does not have a delicate screen, but instead has a large button to select a function and voice recognition to call a particular contact . Bright idea:Tinitell (pictured) was created by Mats Horn in Stockholm, who came up with the idea in 2012 while hanging out with a friend who is also a father when his lost his smartphone and was kept inside to play . This led Mr Horn to create the simple mobile phone for children - 'Nothing advanced, just a nicely designed speaker and microphone to handle quick ‘hellos’ and ‘come here’ signals,’ he said. He saw that the market for a simple mobile for children was still largely untapped and that no big companies had thought of the idea. ‘I realised it’s not in their DNA to make products less advanced. I saw a huge opportunity and customer benefit that I felt obliged to tackle with an affordable solution.’ The Swedish start-up was previously privately funded with loans through the Swedish entrepreneurship infrastructure. Tinitell won Sweden’s largest entrepreneurship competition in 2013 and was declared as the country’s most promising tech start-up. He said that Tinitell’s purpose is to facilitate voice communication between parents and their younger children.

"Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment responsible for television show Sleepy Hollow's Season One DVD release issued an apology today after launching a #HeadlessDay promotion campaign on the same day a second U.S. journalist was beheaded by ISIS in Iraq. Sleepy Hollow released a series of memes with various headless jokes because the show's antagonist just so happens to be the Headless Horseman. The Headless Day promo was emailed to the press shortly after word broke that journalist Steven Sotloff had been beheaded by ISIS militants in Iraq, reports Deadline.com . Apologized: Reps for Sleepy Hollow, a show about a Headless Horseman, apologized for launching their Headless Day campaign on the same day journalist Steven Sotloff was beheaded by ISIS . Bad Timing: Even though the show's antagonist is the Headless Horseman, the timing of their ad campaign couldn't be worse . Beheaded: The ad campaign came out on the same day journalist Steve Sotloff (pictured) was beheaded . Hairy situation: Though memes like this one were meant to be a joke, the campaign was cancelled because its timing was inappropriate . The promo was also emailed just 14 days after the first American journalist James Foley was beheaded by ISIS. 'We apologize for the unfortunate timing of our Sleepy Hollow Headless Day announcement. The tragic news of Steven Sotloff’s death hit the web as the email was being sent. Our deepest sympathies are with him and his family, and we don’t take the news lightly. Had we have known this information prior, we would have never released the alert and realize it’s in poor taste,' wrote a rep for Sleepy Hollow. The campaign featuring Headless Horseman jokes has since been pulled, reports TMZ. 'Does this axe make my head look small?' says one meme portraying a cartoon of the headless Horseman holding a large axe. 'With hair like this, I think I'd rather be headless, says another meme of a woman with a tousled head of hair. 'I knew you'd forget your head if it wasn't attached,' says another. A rep for the digital marketing agency ThinkJam responsible for the campaign said that FOX pre-approved the memes. They also said that the campaign #HeadlessDay was scheduled in advance to go out yesterday 'as a lighthearted way to celebrate the title.' They also said it was sent 'to [journalists]' they thought 'would enjoy it.' Related to the show: Even though many deemed the memes 'inappropriate,' they are related to the show's axe wielding Headless Horseman .

"Lewis Hamilton conjured an impressive qualifying lap to claim his first pole position for eight races ahead of the Italian Grand Prix. Since last starting from top spot on the grid in Spain in May, Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg has claimed six poles in seven grands prix, whilst Hamilton has endured a catalogue of woes. But in a straight fight around a power circuit such as Monza, it was Hamilton who blew everybody out of the water - finishing more than a quarter of a second faster than Rosberg as Mercedes clinched their seventh front-row lock-out of the campaign. Now, click here to read the full report... Host commentator . Thanks for your company today and be sure to join us for tomorrow's race in Monza. Until then, good afternoon. Italian GP Grid: 1 Hamilton; 2 Rosberg; 3 Bottas; 4 Massa; 5 Magnussen; 6 Button; 7 Alonso; 8 Vettel; 9 Ricciardo; 10 Perez . Rosberg is two tenths adrift of Hamilton after his final RUN despite going faster in the final sector. That means Lewis Hamilton will start from pole for tomorrow's race. What a stellar opening lap that was from Hamilton. Turn One should be a tasty affair tomorrow. So, after the first runs, Hamilton is ahead of Rosberg, Bottas, Massa, Button, Vettel, Alonso, Magnussen, Ricciardo and Perez. We've got three minutes remaining. And Hamilton goes fastest by FOUR TENTHS; surely that will be a time which will prove hard to beat? The British driver is looking very handy here. Rosberg is quicker than Hamilton in the first sector, but Hamilton has the upper hand elsewhere. 1:24.552 from Nico Rosberg and that's fast enough for provisional pole... but Hamilton is flying - some three tenths up on his team-mate in the middle sector. Sergio Perez is the first driver to lay down a marker: he posts a 1:26.230. Here we got then... the battle for the top 10 commences. Rosberg is bidding for his fifth straight pole; something which hasn't been done since Sebastian Vettel in 2011. So, who do you fancy to be on pole? Hamilton or Rosberg? Hamilton or Rosberg? Lewis Hamilton ends the session quickest with Rosberg just 0.040secsbehind his team-mate. But in front of the tifosi, Raikkonen crashes out of qualifying. The Finn made errors on both of his timed laps, and he could manage only 12th. Raikkonen locks up heading into turn one, and then runs wide at the chicane, so he eases off the gas to save the tyres and prepare for one final shot. He's on the bubble in 10th so you'll fancy he needs to improve on his time. There are three minutes to run and Magnussen, Kvyat, Vergne, Hulkenberg, Gutierrez and Sutil face elimination from Q2 if they can't improve on their times. The Briton emerges from the Mclaren garage and he pops in the fastest time of the weekend. He is then urged to get a move on so he can go for a second run. And Nico Rosberg storms to the top of the timesheets. He is over 1.5seconds quicker than Kvyat. Here comes Bottas... what can the Williams driver do? He goes second, two tenths off Rosberg's time. Ten minutes left to run and only two timed laps: Kvyat leads the way... but Rosberg is on a flyer... The German posts a 1:31.488 which is a long way short of where he wants to be. He'll run again... Hulkenberg, in his Force India, is the first driver to take to the Monza circuit. Skies are blue, the sun is out and the track is clear. Hamilton will be pleased to be back at the top of the timesheets, but the Briton must make it count in Q3. An impressive display from both Williams men. They have to be considered as serious challengers to Mercedes here. Both Lotus, Marussia and Caterham drivers are out of the session and that's the first time both Maldonado and Grosjean have failed to progress to Q2 since the season opener in Australia. The Lotus pair look to be in trouble here. Both Maldonado and Grosjean occupy the bottom six with less than a minute of Q1 to go. After a scruffy lap, Hamilton responds to leapfrog Massa and Rosberg and return to the top of the timesheets, one tenth or so faster than his Mercedes team-mate. Jules Bianchi, Adrian Sutil, Max Chilton, Kamui Kobayashi and Marcus Ericsson are heading for the exit while the Lotus of Romain Grosjean is yet to set a time... but just as I write that, the Frenchman leaves the pits. 'That was a pretty shocking lap', says Hamilton as he fails to improve his time. Rosberg on the other hand does go quicker, and he bumps Massa down to second. But the championship leader is only 0.035sec quicker than the Williams man. And Massa does lay down a marker in Monza as he posts a 1:25.528 to head the timesheets with eight minutes of Q1 remaining. Williams have looked handy all weekend, and Felipe Massa splits the Mercedes duo as he pops into second. He is less than a tenth off Hamilton's best time. Could the Grove-based outfit spring a surprise today? Fernando Alonso gives the tifosi something to cheer about as he heads to the top of the lap charts, but he is soon eclipsed by Rosberg who is more than six tenths quicker than the Spaniard... but here comes Hamilton... and, boom, the Briton is faster than the pair of them. And we're up and running in Monza. Rosberg, who was battling a gearbox issue, is among the first drivers to take to the track. Sterling work from the Mercedes team there. Hamilton is out on the circuit, too. Hamilton embraces his dad Anthony before stepping in the car. A pivotal qualifying session for the Briton today - he hasn't been on pole for 118 days. There is more than a little suggestion that this could be Luca Di Montezemolo's final grand prix as Ferrari president. Indeed, there is talk the iconic F1 figure could be gone by the middle of next week. The 67-year-old is in the paddock this weekend and he popped into the Ferrari garage to give Fernando Alonso a hug... and it looked as though he enjoyed it. If an when there is something to say about if I am staying I will make an announcement.' Following the drama with Hamilton and Rosberg, Daniel Ricciardo’s second straight win – following his Hungary triumph – was somewhat lost. 'He has been remarkable,’ says his boss Christian Horner. ‘We have been there to capitalise on the misfortunes at Mercedes, but you still have to be there and deliver and Dan has been fantastic at that.’ Ricciardo is 64 points behind Rosberg leading to some suggestions he might yet capture either of the Mercedes’ men. ‘We are a long way behind but we are just going to go for it,’ said Horner. ‘The more pressure we can put on Mercedes more mistakes tend to happen so the objective is flat-out with both of them.’ The Italian Grand Prix has been won from pole 11 times in the last 14 years, making it more important than Monaco, which has only been won from pole nine times in the same period. After what happened at the Belgian Grand Prix, I took a lot of time to reflect on the events of the weekend. I have since apologised to everybody that I can; starting with the fans because they wanted to see a battle with Lewis and that did not happen. I have apologised to my team, and to everybody involved with the team. I have also apologised to Lewis... The Briton, whose deal with Mercedes expires as the end of next season, has held tentative talks with the team he left in 2012. You can ready more on that story here... Rosberg encountered a gearbox problem in final practice this morning meaning he missed the entirety of the session. Lewis Hamilton meanwhile, was quickest. 'We had an electronic problem on the gearbox which normally we can solve,’ said Mercedes boss Toto Wolff. ‘The guys are working hard and hopefully we can get it ready in time. Not running light fuel before qualifying isn’t perfect but he is very experienced. He was in the debrief, and he knows how the car will behave… he will manage.’ A fortnight on from their collision in Spa, Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg will resume their title back in qualifying for tomorrow's Italian Grand Prix. Rosberg has accepted fault for the crash on lap two of the Belgian Grand Prix, and he was subsequently punished by Mercedes with a six-figure fine. He has apologised to the team, Hamilton and the fans - who booed him on the podium, too. For Hamilton, he has been cast 29 points adrift of Rosberg, and you get the feeling he must outscore his team-mate in Monza if he wants to win this championship .","Hamilton records his first pole position since May's Spanish Grand Prix .

"It is quite a way to start your day. Astronaut Reid Wiseman today tweeted this incredible image of his view when he woke up - the sun rising over the curvature of the Earth.

'Tough to beat a good sunrise – on Earth or in low earth orbit,' US astronaut Reid Wiseman told his 262,000 followers. The station crew sees, on average, sixteen sunrises and sunsets during a 24-hour orbital period. Each changeover between day and night on the ground is marked by the terminator, or line separating the sunlit side of Earth from the side in darkness. While the terminator is conceptualized as a hard boundary--and is frequently presented as such in graphics and visualizations--in reality the boundary between light and dark is diffuse due to scattering of light by Earth’s atmosphere. This zone of diffuse lighting is experienced as dusk or twilight on the ground--while the sun is no longer visible, some illumination is still present due to light scattering over the local horizon.

Earlier this week Wiseman tweeted this image, saying 'Good morning from #space' 'My favorite views from #space – just past #sunrise over the ocean' Wiseman tweeted along with this snap on 2nd September. The pair have even developed their own styles, with Gerst preferring abstract patterns on the Earth's surface, while Wiseman favours storms and cities. Recently Gerst took part in a live Facebook Q&A to answer questions from people on Earth. One included Sir Richard Branson, who asked: 'What do you think the role of astronauts will be in 50 years' time? Pioneers? Guides? Or the norm?' Gerst responded: 'My hope would be that in 50 years from now, space travellers will not only be professional agency astronauts, but that everybody should have a realistic chance to make the incredible experience I am having right now. 'Anyway, I hope there will still be pioneers out there who will fly to destinations farther away.'

"Before she killed her son and the little girl she was supposed to be babysitting, prosecutors say that  Elzbieta M. Plackowska, 40, told them they were going to heaven and to get down on their knees and pray. Police found Plackowska covered in blood inside a suburban Naperville, Illinois, home and after extensive questioning, she allegedly told police that she murdered her son Justin, 7, and his friend Olivia Dworakowski because they 'had evil inside of them.' Prosecutors before a judge this morning said that Plackowska was fighting with her husband and felt unappreciated as a babysitter, so she murdered the children in a fit of rage. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Murder charge: Elzbieta Plackowska and her son Justin (right), who was stabbed to death . Justin was found stabbed 100 times. Olivia was stabbed 50 times. Plackowska was denied bail. 'She told Justin he was going to heaven tonight as she repeatedly stabbed him,' DuPage County State's Attorney Robert Berlin said to the court, according to the Daily Herald. 'He begged her to stop and said he loved her.' Mr Berlin described the scene that unfolded before the grisly murder, saying that the two children were jumping on their beds in Olivia's home, where Plackowska was meant to be babysitting her. The babysitter then ordered them to get down on the floor and pray before bed. 'The children had evil inside of them,' Plackowska allegedly told police. Mr Berlin said she 'was trying to drive the evil out of them. She said the devil was inside them.' Both children's throats were slit and Justin was found in a bed, Olivia on the floor. Prosecutors say that after Plackowska killed the innocents, she started frantically calling a local church, leaving numerous messages. Crime scene: The gruesome discovery of the bloody murders was made at this suburban home in Illinois . She then went to a friend's house and . claimed someone had robbed her. Her friend was suspicious of the story . because the details kept changing, Mr Berlin said. Meanwhile, Olivia's mother Marta . Dworakowski, a nurse, called police because when she returned home from . her night shift, Plackowska's car wasn't there and she could not get . into the house. Police were able to get inside the . suburban home on Quin Court just after 10pm and found blood all over the . hallway, leading them to the children's bedroom. 'Both victims had been stabbed numerous times,' Mr Berlin said. 'It appeared to police both victims' throats had been slashed.' Officers also found that the family's two dogs were also stabbed to death. When questioned by police, Plackowska . told them several stories, including one in which a stalker attacked . her own wrists. Eventually, they said, she admitted to killing the . children. She told them that she had been . fighting with her husband Artur, a truck driver, about his work schedule . and felt taken advantage of as a babysitter. The pair has a college age . son as well who has not been named. Sources told the Daily Herald that . Plackowska had been stressed for several days following the death of her . father and she was anxious to return to Poland, a decision her husband . objected to. Olivia was a kindergartner from Brookdale Elementary School and Justin attended Scott School in Naperville District 203. Police say that Plackowska is on suicide watch at the jail after she was charged with two counts of first-degree murder. 'In all my years in law enforcement, . this was the most horrific and gruesome crime scene I have seen,' Naperville Police Chief Robert Marshall said after the hearing today to . the Chicago Tribune.

"Mario Balotelli is the classic enigma. One of the world's best when he's in the mood, but infuriating to watch as he fluctuates in and out of on-the-field strops. Brendan Rodgers says Liverpool's £16million purchase of the striker as a 'calculated risk',but highlighted Balotelli's goalscoring record. His stats are indeed impressive, but there is far more to look into when evaluating a player like Mario. Here, Sportsmail looks at the most intriguing numbers of the Premier League's latest hitman. VIDEO Scroll down for Mario Balotelli: I see expectation from Liverpool fans . Worth the risk? Mario Balotelli has signed for Liverpool in a £16m move from AC Milan . New chance: Balotelli trains on his own at Melwood ahead of his switch . Fall out: But the striker wasn't exactly the most popular character at Manchester City... Top five European leagues, minimum 10 goals . Mario Balotelli (AC Milan) 13.3 . Youssef El-Arabi (Granada) 14.1 . Kevin Volland (Hoffenheim) 14.3 . Antonio Candreva (Lazio) 14.5 . Gonzalo Bergessio (Catania) 14.7 . All stats provided by Opta and only include league data . Balotelli had the lowest shot conversion rate in Europe last season . With AC Milan perhaps over-reliant on the Italian, the onus was on him to create his own magic in Serie A. Plenty of long shots were attempted, and missed, so much so that his ratio from shots to goals was in a European league of its own. Balotelli scored just 14 goals from 152 shots, a conversion rate of 13.3 per cent. Misfire: Balotelli's goal conversion rate in the Serie A last season was the worst in Europe . INTER MILAN . Assists 9 . Chances created 84 . MANCHESTER CITY . Assists 1 . Chances created 37 . AC MILAN . Assists 6 . Chances created 52 . Just one assist in 54 Premier League appearances for Manchester City . Arriving as a 19-year-old with quite an ego, it was clear from the start that Roberto Mancini would struggle to handle his former Inter Milan protege in England. Not one for team spirit, Balotelli was credited with just one spirit during his stay at the Etihad Stadium. Mind you, it couldn't have been more crucial. The striker's  through ball found Sergio Aguero in 2012 against QPR, with the Argentine firing home in stoppage time to secure the Premier League title. Some time to get that assist: Balotelli set up Sergio Aguero's crucial winner against QPR in 2012 . Balotelli at Manchester City 150 . Balotelli in Italy 146.8 . Premier League... minimum 45 goals . 1) Sergio Aguero 120 . 2) Thierry Henry 122 . 6) Alan Shearer 146.9 . Balotelli's minutes-per-goal ratio in Italy is up there with the very best . Aguero's goal in City's 3-1 win against Liverpool on Monday night put him at the top of the charts for impact in the Premier League. Among those on the list of minutes-per-goals was Alan Shearer, the league's record goalscorer, with 147 minutes per goal. Credit to Mario, his  ratio in Italy is 146.7. There's no doubting he makes an impression. Plus side: Balotelli's minutes per goal ratio was superb at Manchester City and in Italy . One of the best: But Balotelli's Serie A recird was better than Alan Shearer's in the Premier League . Balotelli in England . Fouls committed 93 . Yellow cards 12 . Red cards 3 . Balotelli in Italy . Fouls made 256 . Yellow cards 33 . Red cards 1 . Three red cards in the Premier League, one in Serie A . What is it with Mario and England? Balotelli was never sent off at Inter as a youngster, and was dismissed just once with Milan. But with City, the Italian was sent off three times. He clashed with Youssouf Mulumbu against West Brom, and was dismissed for two bookable offences in crucial away games against Liverpool and Arsenal. So that's what Rodgers means about that calculated risk... Poor record: Balotelli racked up three red cards in the Premier League... he had just one in Serie A . 11 yellow cards in Serie A last season, just two for fouls . Sulks, strops and scuffles are three words that best describe Balotelli's attitude in Italy. Manager's often defend Mario's temper, and it's true he rarely sets into a tackle looking to hurt the opposing player. But there's only so much a referee will put up with. Defenders know they can wind up the striker, and bookings often follow. Youngster: Balotelli was raw potential at Inter MIlan, but backed up his talent on the pitch . Bench life: The Italian had to get used to becoming an impact sub at Manchester City .","Liverpool sign Mario Balotelli from AC Milan for £16million .
The striker has been described as a 'calculated risk' by Brendan Rodgers .
Balotelli had lowest shot conversion rate in Europe last season .
Better minutes-per-goals ratio in Italy than Alan Shearer in Premier League .

"Arsene Wenger puffed out his cheeks and strode purposefully down the tunnel. He knew he had been in a game. So did his players. Alexis Sanchez, the matchwinner and hero of the night, and Santi Cazorla, a tireless worker in midfield, were walking gingerly, hobbling even. They had completed 90 minutes but it had taken its toll. This will have made happy viewing in the households of Nigel Pearson and his Leicester City players, Arsenal’s opponents on Sunday. It was tight. Tighter than it has been for many years. Too tight for comfort, by the end. Arsenal tend to stroll through this little technicality in their Champions League programme, the qualification phase. Not on Wednesday night. VIDEO Scroll down for Arsene Wenger: Red card was harsh, Giroud out until December . On target: Alexis Sanchez scores on the stroke of half-time to give Arsenal the lead in their second-leg tie against Turkish side Besiktas at the Emirates Stadium . You've done it: Jack Wilshere, who was instrumental in the build-up to Sanchez's strike, celebrates with the Chile international in front of the delighted home supporters . Arsenal: Szczesny 6.5, Debuchy 5.5, Mertesacker 6.5, Koscielny 7, Monreal 6, Flamini 6, Oxlade-Chamberlain 6.5, Cazorla 6, Wilshere 7, Ozil 5.5 (Chambers, 76), Sanchez 7.5 .

They were a goal ahead shortly before half-time but it afforded a false sense of security. Having failed to score in Istanbul, their single goal did not alter the requirement for Besiktas. An equaliser would still do it and as they went in search of one, so Arsenal’s certainty faded. By the time the home side were reduced to 10 men with 15 minutes to go, it is fair to say panic was spreading, certainly in the stands. Arsenal are a better team than Besiktas, but they were terrifyingly vulnerable to a single aberration, a slack moment of marking or a freak, deflected equaliser. Well outside their comfort zone, the fans bawled and screamed their frustration. To be fair, the anger over Mathieu Debuchy’s dismissal was misplaced. He was rightly booked in the first half for choosing to meet Olcay Sahan with his shoulder, rather than challenging fairly in the air, and taking a yellow card into the second half his clumsy manhandling of Mustafa Pektemek was always going to invite trouble. Referee Pedro Proenca, from Portugal, showed a red and the Emirates erupted, but it was more out of fear than justified indignation. Calum Chambers was then booked for coming on to the field prematurely as Wenger sought to reshuffle the team, and may have a greater beef, but as Besiktas had been denied a very plausible first-half penalty, it is fair to say Arsenal got the best of any incompetence. It would have been a strange penalty, but no less warranted for that. Jack Wilshere, who was exceptional bar this moment of madness and a miss after nine minutes that could have put Arsenal in early command, made a desperate lunge from behind in an attempt to stop Ramon Motta. It was hard to identify specific contact at first, save for the coincidence of both men falling within a split second of each other, but replays showed that in going to ground Wilshere’s hand had clipped Motta’s foot and perhaps sent him tumbling. Certainly, the circumstantial evidence would have convinced more than a few referees; and they would have been right. Nevertheless, Arsenal had the better of the chances on the night and would have felt hard done by had Besiktas progressed. Even in a fraught second half, the best of it belonged to Arsenal and Sanchez in particular will be kicking himself for a miss in the 53rd minute which should have put the result beyond doubt. Debuchy also found the side-netting with a far-post header, Cazorla had an excellent chance blocked and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain could have done better from close range. Time to celebrate: Arsene Wenger will celebrate 17 years in the Champions League.  It was the 1997-98 season when a group stage last took place without Arsenal . Early bath: Mathieu Debuchy was shown a red card in the second half after he picked up a second bookable offence . Chance: Jack Wilshere had the opportunity to open the scoring for Arsenal in their clash against Besiktas, but he dragged his left-footed shot wide of the goal . Time to reflect: The England international holds his head in his hands after dragging his attempt wide after just nine minutes of the Champions League play-off . PLAYER RATINGS - Sanchez the star man... but 5/10 Ozil was infuriating at times . NEIL ASHTON: It's now or never for Wilshere and he start to take his chances . MATCH ZONE SPECIAL: Sanchez delivers the goods... but Arsenal need a target man . Against that, Besiktas will feel they had their moments, not least when Mathieu Flamini made a hash of a pretty straightforward defensive clearance, allowing Demba Ba to seize the ball but plant it wide of Wojciech Szczesny’s goal. In the final minute of normal time Ba could not get his head to a cross at the far post, having lost his marker. Had that gone in, there would have been no way back for Arsenal. Instead, they are in Thursday afternoon’s draw for the Champions League proper, continuing a run of 17 straight campaigns. And, thanks to a warped seeding system, in Pot A, just like the biggest clubs in Europe, those that win domestic leagues and continental titles. It’s nice to be one of UEFA’s chosen few. The result was the best news of the night, obviously. For Wenger, second best was the identity of Arsenal’s goalscorer — Sanchez, the man tasked with pretending to be a striker for the months when Olivier Giroud is absent with his broken foot. He isn’t a natural in the position by any means, maybe not even the solution if Wenger’s resolve wavers before the transfer deadline closes on Monday, but his first goal for the club was a vital one and that can only build confidence. Sanchez’s display in a forward role at Everton last Saturday was unconvincing and his appearance as a lone striker here was seen as something of a gamble, but he got the last word. It was quite a test for him, after all. The final qualification tie for the Champions League is no proving ground, with so much at stake and away goals counting double. Suppose Arsenal required two, or even three on the night? With Giroud injured and the prolific Aaron Ramsey suspended there was a lot of weight on Sanchez’s shoulders. To his credit, he rose to the occasion. He didn’t have much of a first half, and certainly didn’t apply the pressure in the area that Giroud would, but when a chance presented itself he snatched at it, and in a good way. Moments earlier he had overrun a pass from Wilshere to widespread groans, so it is to Sanchez’s credit that he was instantly prepared to assume responsibility in front of goal again. Contest: Per Mertesacker, who captained Arsenal in the absence of Mikel Arteta challenges for the ball. The German was making his second appearance of the season . London calling: Former Chelsea and Newcastle striker Demba in action for Besiktas in the second leg of their Champions League play-off tie against the Gunners . In the stands: Slaven Bilic, who played for West Ham and Everton during his time in England, watches Besiktas from the stands after he was sent off in the first leg . On his marks: Alexis Sanchez takes a first-half free-kick, but it fails to test Tolga Zengin in the Besiktas goal, falling comfortably into the goalkeeper's hands . VIDEO Sanchez showed fighting spirit - Wenger . Flying high: But Demba Ba failed to make contact on the cross which surely would have sent Besiktas through to the group stages . His moment came in the final minute of the half, after a headed clearance had found its way to Wilshere. He played a nice one-two with Mesut Ozil and looked to be shaping to shoot from the return pass. Letting the ball run, however, took it into the path of Sanchez who decided to eschew politeness and have a go, first time. Jackpot. Sanchez struck his shot low and goalkeeper Tolga Zengin could not get down quickly enough. Ultimately, it was all Arsenal required. For the 17th season in succession a delegation from the club will arrive in Monaco for the Champions League draw. It was 1997-98 when balls were last placed in UEFA’s many pots without one containing Arsenal’s name. Princess Diana was still alive and a chap called Steve Jobs had just resumed working at Apple. Considering events at Milton Keynes on Tuesday night and how quickly a football club’s fortunes can change, Arsenal have every reason to be proud of that record. They might even allow themselves a little pat on the back and call it business as usual. What they cannot say this time, however is that it was never in doubt. That little puff of the cheeks suggests Wenger knows it, too. Yellow peril: Arsenal defender  Debuchy picked up his first booking after an airborne challenge leading with his shoulder in the opening half . On the run: Mesut Ozil canters down Arsenal's left-hand side, but his final ball was disappointing and the Turkish side regained possession . So close: Sanchez almost doubled his tally after 51 minutes at the Emirates following a delightful through-ball from team-mate Wilshere . Let me take a selfie: Lukas Podolski was back in the Arsenal squad for the first time this season after winning the World Cup with Germany . Spilling over: Debuchy appeared to confront referee Pedro Proenca at the final whistle before he is pulled back by team-mates' Per Mertesacker and Matheiu Flamini . On his feet: Ba, who had a chance to score an equaliser in the latter stages, is consoled by Mertesacker, and then a smiling Wilshere at the final whistle .","Alexis Sanchez opened the scoring for the home side on the stroke of half-time; his first goal in Arsenal colours .

"A man armed with two knives went on the rampage at a Chinese primary school killing three children, reportedly after his daughter was barred from returning because she hadn't finished her summer assignments. Several others were injured in the attack, some seriously, and the man threw himself off the school's top floor to his death afterwards. The atrocity took place on the first day of the new school term. Horror: The father of a pupil at a Chinese primary school went on the rampage there, killing three, before throwing himself off this building to his death . The suspect was a parent of a student, and he attacked the children because the school did not let his daughter register for the new term because she had not completed her summer homework,  state broadcaster CCTV reported on its microblog. The man entered the school, in Shiyan city of Hubei province, saying he had to register his daughter, CCTV said, citing the initial police investigation. After the attack, the man killed himself by jumping out of the school building, state media said. Violent crime is rare in China compared with many other countries but there have been a series of attacks on schools and children in recent years. Emergency response: A police vehicle in attendance at the scene of the crime . The attacks have led to much soul-searching and calls for measures to improve security at schools in a country were many couples only have one child. The attacker on Monday injured a teacher and eight children, three of whom died on their way to the hospital, CCTV said. A government official in Shiyan, contacted by telephone, declined to comment on the attack. In May, a knife-wielding man stabbed and injured eight students in a primary school in another city in Hubei. In December 2012, a man barged into a village primary school in the central province of Henan and stabbed and injured 23 children.School guards in China are often not equipped or trained to stop such attacks.","A man armed with knives went on the rampage at a Chinese school .

"From two young boys posing with guns to a baby lying on an ISIS flag surrounded by weapons, these images show the children dubbed the jihadists of the future. The shocking photos, which have been posted on social media sites accompanied by chilling messages, were taken by the youngsters' parents and other militants in Syria and Iraq. They include children pointing assault rifles toward the sky, giving the Islamic State's one-finger salute and being indoctrinated in the ways of the extremist group. Scroll down for video . Shocking: This photo, showing two young boys pointing assault rifles toward the sky, was posted on the social networking site Twitter. Its accompanying message reads 'Two young mujahideen for ISIS; not only than 14' Salute: The photos were taken by the youngsters' parents and other militants in Syria and Iraq; a number of whom are believed to be British fighters.

Concerning: In this image (left), posted by Twitter user Abu Farris, a boy appears to operate a machine gun mounted on the back of a truck. Right, a younger child is held by a man with a weapon slung over his shoulder . Alarmingly, a number of the images appear to have been uploaded by British fighters who have travelled to the war-torn countries to wage jihad. One Twitter user, who goes by the name Abu Farris, posted a picture of a child in a balaclava appearing to operate a machine gun mounted on the back of a truck. The accompanying message reads: 'Abul Farooq 7 yr old kid with his dad in dawlah. He's soooo cute!!' Meanwhile, another fighter Abu Turaab has uploaded a photo of a toddler being held by a man with a machine gun slung over his shoulder.

Another user, Ali Al Farsi, who uses the handle @KafirsNightmare and lists his location as Al Sham, a term for Syria, tweeted a picture of a teenage boy. He wrote: 'Abu Alaa, 14 years old, did martyrdom operation, May Allah accept his jihad & give him the highest rank of Al Firdaws.' And another recent image on Twitter shows two young boys clutching assault rifles, with one also pointing to the sky. Education: This image, showing children being indoctrinated by militants, was captioned: '""Brainwashing"" the kids, these kids love us no lie 2am & they sit with us, the next generation to defend tawheed' 'Orphanage': These innocent youngsters are members of a so-called 'ISIS orphanage' based in Mosul, Iraq . A message underneath states: 'Syria: two young mujahideen for ISIS; not older than 14: lol these cats were with me in training camp.' Among the most shocking of the images is one of a baby - who appears to be less than six months old - lying on its on back on the black flag now associated with the group terrorising the Middle East. Where . other babies its age might have soft toys scattered around them, the . child has been cynically positioned next to a Kalashnikov rifle, a . pistol and hand grenades.

"Click here to read Martin Samuel's full column. The funny thing is, some folk still wonder if Manchester United will get back to the top. It’s when. Not if. It is an absolute inevitability. And not long-term, either. Next season, maybe. If not, the year after. Louis van Gaal will bring the title to Old Trafford. That is what modern football demands, that is what the rules dictate. UEFA decided several years ago that they wanted football to remain exactly as it was that day, and introduced regulation to facilitate a natural order. They called it Financial Fair Play. And as on that day Manchester United were the biggest club in England, that is how they shall remain. Lionel Messi (centre) shows some frustration during Barcelona's match against Atletico Madrid on Sunday . Messi celebrates after scoring for Barcelona against Atletico Madrid in the La Liga clash . So, now, if Lionel Messi is available there is one club that can buy him. Not afford him, mark you. Manchester City, Chelsea and a number of others could afford him if their owners were allowed to invest speculatively in their business. Roman Abramovich or Sheik Mansour might calculate that acquiring Messi would be a catalyst for the next stage of development; not just in what he might bring as a footballer, but in the global statement such a move would make. They might decide that, despite the astronomical cost, the end would justify the means if what it gave Manchester City or Chelsea was a rapidly expanded fanbase and increased marketing potential. But then a man in a suit would step in and say no, or impose a punitive fine or, worse, a ban from major competition. This leaves one club with the potential to make Messi’s numbers add up. It is unlikely Messi will arrive at Old Trafford, either way. Much of what is being said in Barcelona appears to be a power play, or contractual brinkmanship. Messi rails against false speculation one moment, and then uses the platform of the Ballon d’Or to announce that he does not know where he will be next season. Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal walks down the touchline after defeat by Southampton on Sunday . Cristiano Ronaldo (left), Lionel Messi (centre) and his girlfriend Antonella Roccuzzo sit beside each other at the FIFA Ballon d'Or award ceremony in Zurich on Monday night . All is not well with Barcelona coach Luis Enrique, apparently, and Messi wants an improved deal. The clever money says that he will get what he wants on both counts: a different coach and a new contract. If not Messi for United then, what of Cristiano Ronaldo or Gareth Bale? Actually, the names are incidental. The bottom line is that there are some calculations that are beyond all bar one club. Even by bringing in Angel di Maria, Luke Shaw, Marcos Rojo, Daley Blind, Ander Herrera and Radamel Falcao on loan in one window, Manchester United demonstrated a financial capability that outstripped all rivals, particularly having failed to qualify for the Champions League. No other club could take a hit of £50million, as United did, and continue investing in this way. Obviously, United need Champions League football from here to finance any grand plan, yet the mathematics of the Messi deal bring home the lopsided logic of FFP, effectively delivering the hope of success to a privileged few. Southampton — incredible interlopers this season — should be able to cement their position, or at least build on it, with ambitious transfer dealing in the January transfer window, having defeated Manchester United at Old Trafford. Barcelona fans show their support for Messi by displaying a banner at the Nou Camp on Sunday . While UEFA would closely monitor this new investment, however, Manchester United — and United alone — could plan a bid for Messi that might top £275m, including a £195m buy-out clause. So what chance do Southampton have, long-term? That 1-0 win on Sunday? Means nothing. Dropping down to fourth place? A tiny bump in the road for United. We are not witnessing the beginning of the wilderness years because UEFA will not allow it. The worst that can happen is a temporary delay on the road back to the top. Manchester United can never be mediocre again. It is unthinkable they will ever go 26 years between titles, as happened from 1967 to 1993. Manchester City are out of the running for players like Messi, and they know it. Their accounts are already under extreme scrutiny from UEFA and the purchase of Wilfried Bony from Swansea City is as close as they can manage to a spree. There is also much talk about Chelsea and Messi but that is moot, too. A frosty relationship with manager Jose Mourinho is said to have thawed, but who cares? Mourinho knows the reality. The club accountant will have the final say on Messi, not him. Jose Mourinho gestures towards Messi during Inter Milan's Champions League semi-final second leg against Barcelona at the Nou Camp in April 2010 . Asked about the deal last month, Mourinho said: ‘I have no chance of that with Messi. At this moment there is Financial Fair Play and we have to follow certain rules, certain numbers and we have no conditions to buy a super, amazing player paid with super, amazing numbers.’ He is too confident in his ability to regard ultimate defeat as unavoidable, but it certainly seems that way. If Van Gaal is as good a coach as his record suggests, this, coupled with Manchester United’s financial supremacy only has one outcome, with or without Messi.","There is only one club that can buy Lionel Messi if he is available .

"A former gym teacher was sent to jail on Friday, after she was found guilty of engaging in a sexual relationship with one of her 15-year-old students for two years. Tania Pontbriand, 43, initiated the relationship in 2002, with one of her male students at Rosemere High School in Quebec, Canada. The victim came forward with the relationship in 2007, and charges were filed a year after that. Bad romance: Tania Pontbriand (right) was sentenced to 20 months in prison on Friday for carrying out a two-year sexual relationship with a 15-year-old student (face concealed on left), starting in 2002 . Mother: Pontbriand (pictured walking into court) hoped to get a lighter sentence since she didn't want to be separated from her two young children . He says he became depressed after they broke up, and it caused him to flunk out of university. Pontbriand was mostly controlled in court on Friday, as she was sentenced to 18 months in prison for two counts of sexual exploitation and 20 months for one count of sexual assault. The sentences will be served concurrently and she will be on probation for two years after that . But she started to cry when the judge refused to grant Pontbriand's request to report to jail in a week so she could say goodbye to her two young children. Instead, she was remanded straight to prison, as about 10 family members watched. The judge wrote in a 150-page decision that Pontbriand's sentence reflected the fact that she betrayed the trust society places in teachers. School grounds: The victim was one of Pontbriand's male students at Rosemere High School in Quebec, Canada . 'Students, parents, authorities and society have the right, not the privilege, to have full trust in their teachers in their roles of educating and instructing children and adolescents,' the judge wrote. 'During the day, these teachers, in exercising their duties, continue the role of parental authority.' The judge added that it doesn't make a difference that Pontbriand is a woman, and her victim a male. 'The sexual exploitation of a male adolescent by a female teacher must be punished just the same as a male posing the same actions towards a female adolescent,' he wrote. The victim, now in his 20s, said in a statement in June that Pontbriand alienated him from his family and friends 'so as to satisfy her own egotistic and sexual desires'. 'I was far too naive at the time to recognize her lies and manipulation,' he wrote. Impact: The victim, now in his 20s, said in a statement that he and Pontbriand had 200-300 sexual encounters and that he became depressed when they broke up, flunking out of school . He said they had about 200-300 sexual encounters during the two-year affair, which were carried out at her home, in her car, in her office at his home and other locations. The victim says the relationship had disastrous effects on his life, causing him to become depressed and drop out of school. Pontbriand has already appealed the guilty verdict. She argued for a lighter sentence, saying the case has already impacted her two young kids since she lost her job and reputation.","Former teacher Tania Pontbriand was sentenced to 20 months in prison on Friday for carrying out a sexual relationship with a 15-year-old male student .

A couple of hours after the afternoon killing spree Tuesday, police learned that three people at a Motel 6 near I-29 and Barry Road  had been physically assaulted, and another was nearly carjacked. The police statement said no weapon was used in those assaults. In the course of the investigation, police found a 2002 Toyota Highlander that had been stolen from one of the crime scenes. Shortly before midnight, officers arrested Brandon Howell, whom they positively identified as a suspect in the motel assaults, according to a police statement. Responding police officers also seized a gun from the suspect at the time of his arrest, Fox 4 KC reported. According to the shooting victims' neighbors, the deadly spree resulted from a botched robbery. Local residents speaking to Fox 4 KC said that Susan Choucroun and the Hursts spotted a man trying to steal a vintage Jaguar from their neighbors' house on Woodbridge Lane. Special bond: According to a statement from the Hurst family, Darrel Hurst (right) was visiting his elderly mother (left) at the time of the shooting . Heartbroken: Charles Choucroun tearfully recalled the moment he was told his wife, Susan, was among the casualties . Not knowing that the would-be car thief was armed with a shotgun, the victims came up to him as he was trying to drive away and were shot at a point-blank range. The gunman then jumped into a Toyota Highlander belonging to the couple he had beaten up and took off from the scene. Neighbor Vicki Gruver, 74, described Lorene Hurst as a lovely lady who enjoyed travel, and Darrel Hurst as a doting son. Susan Choucroun is survived by her husband, Charles, who owns a beauty salon in Prairie Village. The elderly man was not home at the time of the tragedy. Speaking to Fox4 KC, the devastated man tearfully recounted how he came home Tuesday only to discover crime scene tape around his block. One of the police officers on the scene broke the news to him that his wife was among the victims. More details also emerged today about the violent past of the man at the center of the triple murder investigation. Brandon Howell was accused in the late 1990s of killing two teenagers in Johnson County, but in 2009 a jury found him not guilty. The 34-year-old also has a prior conviction in connection to a 1999 burglary where a cat named Tony was beheaded. He was released on parole in 2011. A car to die for: Neighbors say the Hursts and Choucroun were killed because they prevented the gunman from staling this vintage Jaguar from a nearby home . Clue: Police found this 2002 Toyota Highlander that was stolen from one of the crime scenes . Tom Brewer, the father of 16-year-Tabitha Brewer who was killed along with her boyfriend, Nick Travis, 18, in 1998, told the Kansas City Star Wednesday that when he saw Howell's picture on TV, he immediately recognized him as the man who was acquitted in his daughter's murder. ‘I feel sorry for the jurors who acquitted him the last time because that is going to be hard for them to live with,’ Brewer said. ‘I believe justice is always served one way or another.’ The triple homicide - the most deadly incident Kansas City has seen in more than two years - left people living in the middle-class neighborhood shaken. ‘In the last few years we’ve had many young families move in. It is a very, very desirable place to live,’ Jo Lombardino, a member of the Woodbridge Homes Association, told the Kansas City Star. Possible connection: Investigators were called to this Motel 6 just four blocks from where the missing SUV was found after getting reports of three assaults and a carjacking . Person of interest: Police arrested 34-year-old Howell in the motel attacks .","Lorene Hurst, 88, her 63-year-old son, Darrel, and 69-year-old Susan Choucroun identified as victims of triple shooting in Kansas City Tuesday .

"A relaxed Saturday morning atmosphere reigned at Camp David today as ten of the world's most powerful people huddled in a log cabin in the Appalachian Mountains. Gone were the ties and furrowed brows of a busy week, cast aside for open-necked shirts and cosy woollens as the likes of David Cameron, Barack Obama and Russia's Dmitri Medvedev sat back amid the idyllic Maryland setting. Looking at the pictures from today's meeting, it is almost hard to believe these were the leaders of the G8 nations grappling with the problems of soaring oil prices and the eurozone on the brink of collapse. Dress down: The eurozone may be in crisis but David Cameron looked remarkably laid back at the G8 Summit, pictured alongside a grinning Russian PM Dmitri Medvedev and German chancellor Angela Merkel . The Prime Minister and his U.S. counterpart kicked off their weekend in typically sporting fashion, taking to President Obama's gym for a bout of treadmill diplomacy. The president was said to have called for Mr Cameron at around 7.15am at his cabin - called Maple - at the picturesque retreat. After a session pounding the treadmills, the two men emerged still deep in conversation. They were seen walking back to the cabins around 7.50am. Officials attending the summit were coy about which man had been the more athletic performer - instead emphasising the intellectual content of their encounter. It seems Mr Cameron is not one to let the pressures of running the country get in the way of a little downtime. A new book describes his leisurely weekend lifestyle, which apparently finds him indulging in the odd frame of snooker, a few glasses of wine with Sunday lunch or even a spot of karaoke. In the biography, entitled Cameron: Practically a Conservative, a friend says of the PM: 'If there was an Olympic gold medal for ‘chillaxing’, he would win it.' Idyllic setting: Talks begin between the leaders of (clockwise from lower left) Japan, Italy, Canada, France, the U.S., the UK, Russia, Germany, the European Council and the European Commission . Relaxed: (from left) Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti, U.S. President Barack Obama, David Cameron and Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev listen cheerfully to German Chancellor Angela Merkel during the G8 Summit at Camp David, Maryland . True to this casual outlook, Mr Cameron met with his fellow world leaders in a grey jumper with a checked collar underneath, while on either side of him, Mr Obama and the Russian Prime Minister Mr Medvedev sported blue, open-necked shirts. The first working session of the G8 Summit came after officials had worked through the night to find an agreed form of wording on the eurozone issue for the final summit communique. Following his preparatory talks with Mr Obama, the Prime Minister signalled that the G8 leaders were ready to tackle soaring oil prices. Mr Cameron said action was needed to protect world economies. 'We are addressing here the two biggest threats to all our economies and that is, of course, the eurozone crisis but also the very high oil prices that translate into high prices at the pumps,' he said. 'We are making progress on both.' Picturesque: Angela Merkel and her aides arrive at Camp David, set high in the Appalachian Mountains, for a bilateral meeting with Mr Medvedev . Back to nature: Chancellor Merkel (second from right) and Mr Medvedev (right) hold talks over coffee in Camp David's idyllic woodland setting . Mr Cameron said the summit - which brings together the leaders of Britain, the United States, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, Canada and Russia - was an opportunity for the non-eurozone nations to press the currency bloc to resolve its problems. 'Particularly on the eurozone, what is required is a sense of urgency and then clear actions for strong banks, strong deficit reduction plans, strong governance and strong contingency plans for whatever might happen,' he said. 'On all those things I think there's a good sense of talks taking place and a good sense that action needs to follow. 'The G8 can't instruct the eurozone what to do but why meetings like this matter is that eurozone countries can hear from countries outside the eurozone whose economies are affected. Enjoying the view: President Obama shows his fellow leaders round the Camp David retreat on a sunny G8 Summit Saturday . Keep up, Cameron: Mr Obama and Angela Merkel (in purple) lead the pack as the G8 representatives stroll through Camp David . New addition: Recently elected French President Francois Hollande (left) shares a joke with the U.S. President as Angela Merkel and David Cameron line up on the lawn . 'It's very important these messages get across but I would say there is a growing sense of urgency that action needs to be taken, contingency plans need to be put in place and the strengthening of banks, governance, firewalls, all of those things, need to take place very fast.' Mr Cameron refused to be drawn into criticising German Chancellor Angela Merkel for blocking a rescue package for the eurozone. However, he indicated that he would like to see the European Central Bank do more to stimulate demand. 'I think the German chancellor is absolutely right that every country needs to have in place strong plans for dealing with their deficits,' he said. 'Growth and austerity aren't alternatives. You need a deficit reduction plan in order to get growth in order to have the low interest rates that we have in Britain and are vital for the future of our economy. 'But clearly, just as Britain benefits from a strong government with a strong deficit reduction plan and strong banks but also an independent monetary policy giving us low interest rates, helping to push demand in the economy, so the eurozone, I believe, needs that approach as well.' First ladies' meet: As the Group of Eight gathered in Camp David, Michelle Obama hosted some of the leaders' spouses for a tour of the White House in Washington, DC .

"Last night, a few days after returning from our annual family holiday, I went through all the photographs we had taken on our various smartphones over the fortnight. It came as no surprise to discover there was not one single snap of me. I hate having my picture taken. What floored me, though, was how many there were of Flo and Annie, my teenage girls. They had clearly been taking pictures of themselves endlessly. The results made me proud and depressed in equal measure. Scroll down for video . Privileged: Shona's daughters Flo and Annie won't feel inadequate and unattractive like she did growing up . There they were sunning themselves on a rock, lying on the beach, drinking mocktails at the bar. Stupid me to assume they'd come on holiday to admire Croatian culture - what they really wanted to capture for posterity was countless images of themselves. If I sound a little jealous, you'll have to forgive me. Staring in awe at one photograph after another of my daughters in skimpy bikinis was enough to drive the point home that I have never come close to looking like that. And it wasn't just their beauty that made me seethe with an uncomfortable mix of pride and bitterness. I was also flooded with unease at the confidence they exuded. It seemed to me as if they were saying to the world: 'We're beautiful, and we know it.' Such audacity. Such knowingness. Yet somehow still so very innocent. I may have given birth to these two gorgeous creatures, but their adolescence will be a world apart from mine. How will I ever advise them how to navigate the passions they will arouse in boys and the jealousies they'll engender in girls? As someone who has hated the way she has looked since childhood, I am at a loss at how to guide them through this delicate stage of their lives. I've written before about coming to terms with my looks, and how it has taken me most of my adult life to accept the fact that my face will never launch even the smallest pedalo, let alone a thousand ships. I am a bit of an odd-looking bird. Longed for a different face: Shona aged 14 . It's easier to accept the cards I was dealt now I am a 43-year-old mother of four. I have a lovely home and family, a job I adore and a husband who doesn't seem to care how I look as long as I am happy. Which, believe it or not, I am. But for most of my teenage years, it was a different story. I didn't need girls at school to tell me that a birthmark over my right eye left it looking wonky - or that a mis-shaped jaw made my front teeth stick out. I was under no illusions. But how I longed for a different face - one that might get me to the periphery of the 'in' crowd at school, which all the pretty girls inhabited. It seemed an even harsher twist of fate that both my parents were stunningly good looking. At school open days I would watch, pained, as girls in my class looked in amazement from them, to me, and back again. No, I wasn't adopted. Yes, my mother probably did wonder if I had been swapped at birth. Of course my parents tried to tell me I had other attributes. My mother would say things like: 'You've got an attractive face, darling. It's far more interesting than being conventionally pretty.' All of which skirted around the fact that my face was so disappointing not even a mother could call it beautiful. And so like everyone who suffers from rock-bottom self-esteem, I compensated in other ways. I became an accomplished character actress, and tried not to feel disappointed at getting the part of Bottom in A Midsummer Night's Dream when I would have loved to have been cast as Titania. I worked really hard at being a loyal, reliable friend. I was made head girl only to lose my badge on a skiing trip a few months later when I followed my friends out of our hotel room and down a drain pipe to go to a disco. It was a small price to pay for being temporarily included in something the cool crowd were doing. Now, when I look back on it, I see that everything I did as a teenager was to balance the inadequacy of my appearance. Which is why, as a mother, I marvel at the fact that, through some genetic malfunction, I have given birth to the very girls who terrified me at school. Flo and Annie are the antithesis of my teenage self. They will never know how it feels to stand in a girls' loo trying not to cry because someone has made a barb about their funny face. Neither has a clue how it feels to be lonely at school. Neither seems to realise how truly privileged they are. I know I should be relieved for them that their mobiles never stop ringing; that when they post a Facebook snap of themselves, they are inundated with compliments. But their effortless confidence needles me a little. I often watch them as they saunter into school, flicking their hair nonchalantly. Worlds apart: Shona knows her daughters' adolescence will be much different to her own . How does it feel, I wonder, to take your place in the world without being held back by the slightest insecurity about your appearance? They say beauty is a curse. Not from where I'm standing it isn't. A charity report last week confirmed that looks are more important than ever. The Good Childhood Report, published by the Children's Society, said that girls in England today rank as some of the saddest in the world because of concerns over their body image. So in some ways I thank my lucky stars that my girls show no such concerns. Of course, if you asked Flo and Annie they could come up with a long list of flaws they perceive themselves to have. Certainly, when I told them I was tackling this issue, they pleaded with me to make it clear that under no circumstances do they believe themselves to be beautiful. But, for me, this is like hearing Cindy Crawford complain about her facial mole or Lily Cole her red hair. Annie is only 13 and already flirts with an ease I have never possessed. Our local takeaway man is smitten - although Annie tells me she only does it to get extra spring rolls. Researchers have found that attractive parents pass on good looks to daughters, but not to sons . Flo, too, has admirers who really should know better. A taxi driver recently commented how much she looks like a young Jerry Hall. Instead of feeling proud, I found myself snapping: 'She's only 15.' The poor man looked horrified. I have shown both the girls photographs of how I looked at their age and they howl with laughter. I hope it helps them understand how it feels to be that girl, whoever she is. I'd like to invite her over for tea and force my daughters to see that behind every Ugly Betty there is someone like me desperate to emerge. But they just tell me that's weird and could I please butt out. I'll never forget once interviewing Sarah Ferguson and her telling me that she stood Eugenie and Beatrice in front of a mirror every day and told them how stunning they were. She was determined that her own feelings of inadequacy would never be passed on to her daughters. It's a good lesson and one I have tried to adopt with Flo and Annie. I feel I owe them praise, whether they need it or not. It's hardly their fault they look this way any more than being so plain was mine. The other day when we were all standing in front of the mirror, me cringing in the background, Flo said: 'You know, Mum, you're too harsh on yourself because you are beautiful in your own way.' Perhaps, just sometimes, it helps mothers to hear it from their daughters, too.","Shona Sibary, 43, seethes with an uncomfortable mix of pride and bitterness .

"Police handcuffed dozens of protesters in cities across the country on Thursday as they blocked traffic in the latest attempt to escalate their efforts to get McDonald's, Burger King and other fast-food companies to pay their employees at least $15 an hour. The protests, which were planned by labor organizers for about 150 cities nationwide today, are part of a campaign called 'Fight for $15'. Since the protests began in late 2012, organizers have switched up their tactics every few months to bring attention to the protests, which have attracted spotty crowds. Scroll down for video . A fast food worker is detained by Los Angeles police after staging a sit-in outside a McDonald's restaurant during a demonstration against low wages on Thursday . Protesters sit in front of a McDonald's restaurant on 42nd Street in New York's Times Square as police officers move in to begin making arrests. A day of planned protests were taking place in 150 cities across the country by workers from fast-food chains . A McDonald's worker is detained by police during a protest to push fast-food chains to pay their employees at least $15 an hour, outside a McDonald's restaurant today in Philadelphia . Organizers previously said they planned to engage in nonviolent civil disobedience on Thursday, which might lead to arrests. In the past, supporters have done things like show up at a McDonald's shareholder meeting and hold overseas protests. The movement, which is backed financially by the Service Employees International Union and others, comes at a time when the wage gap between the poor and the rich has become a hot political issue. Many fast-food workers do not make much more than the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, which adds up to about $15,000 a year for 40 hours a week. Protestors chant for increased wages and union rights in Las Vegas. Protesters were arrested as they blocked traffic . The protests have gotten media coverage. In Chicago, for instance, reporters observed supporters arriving on buses and sitting on a street between a McDonald's and Burger King, chanting: 'We shall not be moved.' 'The impact is in bringing it into the public attention,' said Chris Rhomberg, an associate professor of sociology at Fordham University in New York. President Obama has taken notice too. He mentioned the campaign at a Labor Day appearance in Milwaukee. 'If I were busting my butt in the service industry and wanted an honest day's pay for an honest day's work, I'd join a union,' Obama said, as he pushed Congress to raise the minimum wage. Police handcuff protesters blocking traffic on Mack Avenue in Detroit as part of a national protest to push fast-food chains to pay their employees a living wage . Protesters in T-shirts and bearing hand-made signs are cuffed by police in Detroit. Organizers previously said they planned to engage in nonviolent civil disobedience on Thursday, which might lead to arrests . The National Restaurant Association said in a statement that the protests are an attempt by unions to 'boost their dwindling membership.' The industry lobbying group said it hopes organizers will be respectful to customers and workers during the protests. Union organizers expected thousands to show up to Thursday's protests around the country. Previously, turnout has been fairly minimal in many places. In an effort to get more people involved, organizers asked other service workers to join protests and added more cities than it previously had. Shanicka Primo, who was at a protest at McDonald's in New York, said she heard about the demonstration after organizers came to the Checkers restaurant where she works. The 20-year-old earns $8 an hour at the burger chain and said a raise to $15 per hour would help her get her own apartment. 'I wouldn't have to live with my family,' Primo said. Carmalita Johnson drums as protesters participate in a rally outside a McDonald's on Chicago's south side as labor organizers escalate their campaign to unionize the industry's workers . Police officers arrest two protesters in their McDonald's uniforms in front of a McDonald's restaurant in New York's Times Square . In some cities, protesters were hauled away by police for blocking streets. Police handcuffed about a dozen people who wouldn't leave in Chicago. In New York, at least three people wearing McDonald's uniforms were taken by police officers after standing in the middle of a busy street near Times Square. Nineteen were arrested for blocking traffic. About two dozen protesters were handcuffed in Detroit after they wouldn't move out of a street near a McDonald's restaurant. And police in Las Vegas also handcuffed some demonstrators, giving about 10 of them citations to appear in court. Among those hauled away was Tyree Johnson. He said he earns $8.45 an hour after working at a Chicago McDonald's for more than two decades. 'I've been there 22 years and I can't help my family,' he said.

"A furious bidding war for the Hollywood film rights to the British publishing phenomenon of the year has broken out – even before the book has been released. Us by David Nicholls is already the most hotly awaited novel of the year. His last book, One Day, sold an astonishing five million copies - including two million in Britain alone - after its publication in 2009. The first ever glimpse of Us will be revealed in this weekend’s Mail on Sunday, with an exclusive 8,500-word extract in a special issue of You magazine. It sets up the plot of a couple and their teenage son touring Europe as they attempt to salvage their crumbling marriage – a storyline that was inspired by Nicholls’ own experience of promoting One Day five years ago. Hotly awaited: Us by David Nicholls (pictured) has been the object of a bidding war even before it's release . Booksellers expect huge demand for the novel, which is predicted to top best seller lists around the world when it is published by Hodder & Stoughton on September 30 – and now Mail Online can reveal that Russell Crowe is among the Hollywood A-listers locked in a battle for the film rights. One Day was adapted into a film in 2011 starring Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess as lovers whose relationship was charted on the same date over several years. Nicholls last night confirmed to MailOnline that there was interest in a film version of his new novel. ‘Yes, there has been talk about that. Of course I would love it to have another life like One Day.’ Gladiator star Crowe is reported to want to both produce and star in the adaptation. A leading British film producer said: ‘I am putting in for the book and so is everybody else I know. There is a great deal of interest in it and some of Hollywood’s biggest stars including Crowe believe it could be the ideal vehicle for them.’ Smash hit: One Day sold five million copies . Another industry source said: ‘A number of production companies are already taking an active interest.’ Explaining that a film is inevitable, the source added: ‘It’s not a question of if, it’s a question of when.’ In Us, middle-aged scientist Douglas Peterson is married to Connie, who was once the love of his life. Now, though, it appears their marriage is all but over. In one last attempt to rekindle their love they take a trip across Europe with their rebellious teenage son Albie in tow. The book follows the mismatched trio on their adventures in Paris, Amsterdam, Munich, Venice, Florence, Sienna, Madrid and Barcelona. Each destination on the trip triggers a memory of happier times - and all three members of the family must question whether they have a future together. Experts believe the story will have widespread appeal and could be a break-out hit among older audiences - like Best Exotic Marigold Hotel which starred Dames Judi Dench and Maggie Smith, and Bill Nighy. One insider said: ‘You have got three brilliant lead characters and it’s a perfect film for an older demographic.’ Sources close to the book say Nicholls has told interested parties he doesn’t even want to sit down for detailed talks until October. He is known to have a close working relationship with BBC Films, the Corporation’s feature film division, and another collaboration with them is a distinct possibility. Nicholls has just adapted a big screen adaptation of Far From The Madding Crowd for the BBC which stars Carey Mulligan and will be released next year. Friends say Nicholls is unlikely to adapt the film himself following what is said to be his unhappy experience on the 2011 adaptation of One Day. The movie took a respectable $70 million at the box office but some fans were unhappy with the casting of Hathaway as the book’s Yorkshire heroine. Young love: One Day was adapted for the big screen in 2011, starring Jim Sturgess and Anne Hathaway . Although not yet published, Us has already been recognised with a place among the 13 books on the Booker Prize longlist - unlike Martin Amis, who missed out with his new novel The Zone Of Interest. Nicholls’ fans are eagerly awaiting the announcement of the shortlist on Tuesday to see if Us has been chosen as one of the final six.","Mail on Sunday to exclusively release first glimpse of David Nicholls’ Us this weekend – with major 8,500-word extract .

"Luis Suarez struck twice for Barcelona in a friendly against the B team which was specifically organised to boost his fitness. The Uruguayan striker, banned until late October, notched two goals as the first-team won 5-1 in a 60-minute game at the Ciutat Esportiva. VIDEO Scroll downto watch Luis Suarez in Barcelona training during international break . Back in action: Luis Suarez played in a 60 minute game against Barcelona B . On target: Suarez scored twice in the friendly game as he bids to improve his fitness ahead of his return . Team player: Suarez had a good game aside from scoring two goals . Making the headlines: The front page of Sport . Suarez played well on top of his goals, working hard and unselfishly, making it clear that were it not for his ban, he would be in Luis Enrique's side. Tata Martino last season tried on occasion to arrange similar friendlies, but was told that it may affect Barca B's schedule. Enrique, on the other hand, didn't take no for an answer and it is likely he will arrange at least two more games against Barca B before Suarez's ban expires. The aim is to have Suarez fit enough to play against Real Madrid, if needs be, which is the first match he is eligible for after his ban expires. As well as Suarez, there were several other Barca players who benefited from the friendly. Marc-Andre ter Stegen has spent time injured and would have been grateful for the opportunity to stake his place for a starting berth. Full-back Douglas also played, although Lionel Messi, who missed Argentina's friendly against Germany on Wednesday because of a problem in his right leg, was not ready to feature.","Uruguayan striker bagged a brace in the 60 minute friendly .

"When you think of Wayne Rooney, what are your standout memories? I have three. The first is of him as a fresh-faced and fearless 18-year-old, lighting up Euro 2004; second is his magnificent season in 2009-10 when he fired 34 goals for Manchester United and was named PFA Player of the Year. Third comes the 2010 World Cup qualifying campaign when he scored nine times under Fabio Capello. Others will have their own highlights but it is doubtful anyone will place Wednesday’s game against Norway at the top of their list. Though he marked his first match as captain with an emphatically dispatched penalty, nobody was in a hurry to shout about his display. If anything, it raised a question: have we seen the best of him? VIDEO Scroll down to watch Wayne Rooney flaunting his skills in England training . Struggle: Wayne Rooney (centre) did not look at his best for England on Wednesday and has not for a while .

Joy: The forward celebrates scoring against Wigan Athletic in August 2009, at the start of the campaign . All smiles: Rooney scored nine times during England's qualification for 2010 World Cup under Fabio Capello . Finish: Rooney was in the form of his life in the 2010 World Cup qualification campaign for England . Rooney is 28 and during the next three years he will be in the period commonly regarded as being the peak for a footballer. For the vast majority, it is the spell when they produce form of higher quality and greater consistency than ever. Yet Wayne is different. Making his debut in the Barclays Premier League at 16 confirmed him as exceptional but it also meant there was potential for him to peak early. Having made 615 appearances for club and country, he has stats that you would expect of a player in his mid-30s. Think about it. Cars are not valued by their licence plate but on how many miles they have done. Competing at the highest level for the past 12 years, with all the pressure and intensity that accompanies it, leaves a mark. Can you imagine, from the age of 18, having to carry the burden of being the man for club and country? Playing at the highest level is mentally and physically draining and the pressure on players like Rooney takes a toll. What is happening to Wayne is not unprecedented. Look through the history books and you will see that those forwards who burst on to the scene as teenagers were rarely able to sustain that impact and consistency for entire careers. Defenders tend to have longer careers because it is possible for them to plod through games but with forwards, it is all about being explosive. Sharp movements, swift changes of gear, constantly operating on the edge, while taking a battering in the process. Look at Robbie Fowler. When he was 19, he was Liverpool’s best player and for three seasons, between 1994 and 1997, his goal record was exceptional but when he reached 26, he was no longer first choice at Anfield. Michael Owen burst on to the scene. Like Wayne, he was seen as the saviour for his club and country at the age of 18. Michael was sensational between 1998 and 2002, winning the Ballon d’Or, but physically and mentally it was a big burden to carry. By the time of Euro 2004, there were calls for Michael to be replaced by Wayne. Michael moved to Real Madrid that summer but he would admit his best form was before he was 25. Neither Michael nor Robbie were helped by injuries - were they triggered by starting out so young? Skipper: Rooney has been given both the United and England captaincy but is no longer as explosive . Games: Rooney has played 615 matches in his career at the age of 28, as many as players in their mid-30s . Young starters: Michael Owen (left) and Robbie Fowler (right) broke into the first team at Liverpool as teens . Best years behind him: Owen left Liverpool for Real Madrid and then Newcastle United but was not as potent . Maybe that needs to be considered with Raheem Sterling. He is in the position Wayne and Michael were in - the rising young star of English football - but it’s important he is protected and not flogged by club and country in the next few years. This problem is not confined to English players. Take Raul, for example. A 16-year-old sensation at Real Madrid, Sir Alex Ferguson once called him ‘the best in the world’. He scored 134 goals in a five-season spell, between 1998 and 2002, when Madrid won three European Cups. Over the next eight years, he scored 131 but in his final few seasons at the Bernabeu, he was a shadow of the player he had been. Did that stem from being overplayed and subjected to great mental pressure from so early on? Even the absolute best, the Brazilian Ronaldo and Thierry Henry, found their influence fading by their late 20s (both played top-flight football as teenagers) and there has been talk that we may not see again the Lionel Messi who mesmerised for Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona. There is no doubt that last season, and his performances at the World Cup, showed there is less dynamism in his game, comments which have also been made about Rooney. Oustanding: Raheem Sterling, at 19 years old, has been a stand-out performer for England this summer . Environment: Carragher is worried that Sterling may shine as youngster but, like Rooney, wane as he ages . Peaked too soon? Raul's goalscoring ratio deteriorated quite rapidly as his career at Real Madrid progressed . Wane: Strikers Thierry Henry (left) and Ronaldo (right) became less potent as they reached their late-20s . Distant memories? Lionel Messi starred under Pep Guardiola but he has struggled a bit in the past year . Don’t mistake this for a criticism of Wayne. It isn’t. He has been a great player for United and has the honours to prove it. He has been very good for England, too, and is likely to break both the scoring and caps records held respectively by Sir Bobby Charlton and Peter Shilton. But at the moment, questions are being asked of him, such as, ‘Does he deserve his place in the team?’ Rooney might not be at his best but in his last three England games he has scored twice and provided an assist. The time to ask whether he should still be picked is when he no longer contributes. I would have played him in Switzerland on Monday night even before Daniel Sturridge was injured. Danny Welbeck, who had been suggested as an alternative to Rooney, has only eight goals in 27 games for England. Wayne has 41 - 31 of which have been in competitive games. He might not be playing well but he still believes he will score whenever he does feature. He will still influence this England team, it just might not be as spectacularly as 10 years ago. Blow: Daniel Sturridge picked up a knock during England training at St George's Park . Scotland can upset the odds and catch Germany cold . I had the privilege of watching Germany’s last competitive game from the stands and on Sunday I will be in the Sky studios when they begin qualifying for Euro 2016. It doesn’t seem two months since Germany became world champions in the Maracana but that heady night against Argentina prompted a changing of the guard and it will be interesting to see how Scotland fare in Dortmund. Gordon Strachan and his squad should be relishing this opportunity to take on Germany in Dortmund’s magnificent Westfalenstadion. Nobody will be giving Scotland a hope of getting a result but maybe this is as good a time as any to face Germany. Time to shine: Carragher believes Scotland can upset the odds and surprise world champions Germany . Prize guys: (from left) Mario Gotze, Manuel Neuer and Thomas Muller won the World Cup earlier this summer . Since they beat Argentina, Philipp Lahm - their captain and best full back - has retired, as have their record-breaking striker Miroslav Klose and the Arsenal defender Per Mertesacker. Maybe Germany will not be as strong as they were in Brazil? True, the midweek 4-2 defeat by Argentina might prompt a reaction from Joachim Low’s squad but Scotland have nothing to lose and everything to gain. Perhaps this could be the initial step that leads the Scots to a major tournament for the first time since 1998. Once Germany get into their stride, they will win Group D but Scotland will be optimistic of finishing in front of the Republic of Ireland and Poland to take second place and secure a trip for the Tartan Army to France in two years’ time. Time to go: German World Cup winners Miroslav Klose (left) and Philipp Lahm (right) have retired . What I'm looking forward to this week... Heading to my local ground to watch some authentic football. With the Premier League taking a break because of international fixtures, I’m taking the opportunity to go to the Arriva Stadium with my son, James, to watch Marine v FC United of Manchester in the Evo-Stik League. Given that it is a Liverpool-Manchester rivalry, I’ve no doubt that it will be fiercely competitive and, with luck, there should be a decent crowd, too. If you’re like me, the last thing you will want to do on a Saturday afternoon is head to the shops! Local football: Carragher hopes longer international intervals will get more fans attending non-league football . The international break has got me thinking, though. The way the Euro 2016 qualifying fixtures are now spaced out means that non-League clubs are going to have an opportunity to attract spectators who wouldn’t usually go to their games. Saturday is the annual Non-League Day. If communities made a conscious effort to go and give their local teams their backing, it would make a difference in safeguarding their futures. Teams like Marine are proud of their history and heritage. Recently, Formby, another well-known Merseyside club, had to fold. If we all support Non-League Day, maybe in the future other clubs around the country will not suffer a similar fate.

"Israel’s decision to grab nearly 1,000 acres of Palestinian land to build settlements was condemned by David Cameron yesterday as ‘utterly deplorable’. Israel announced on Sunday that an area of the West Bank, near existing settlements at Etzion, south of Bethlehem, has been designated as ‘state land’ which means it can be used for homes for Israelis. The move came days after an indefinite ceasefire brought an end to weeks of conflict in Gaza during which more than 2,100 Palestinians and 73 Israelis were killed. Scroll down for video . Condemned: David Cameron used unusually strong language to condemn Israel's land grab . The existing settlement of Gevaot in the Gush Etzion settlement bloc near Bethlehem. The 1,000 acres of Palestinian land which is being seized is also near the city . Israel has been criticised for its move to seize 1,000 acres of Palestinian land. It is expected to be used to extend settlements close to the existing Gush Etzion settlement bloc (above) near Bethlehem . Israel's land grab will extend existing settlements around Bethlehem, which is already host to the Gaveot settlement (above). Like most West Bank settlements it is heavily guarded with a perimeter fence . Land grab: Israeli soldiers swooped on 1,000 acres of Palestinian territory yesterday, sending a shock wave of anger across the Arab world (stock image) Israeli anti-settlement group Peace Now accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of building obstacles to the creation of a Palestinian state and a lasting peace. Mr Cameron, addressing MPs on the summer crises in Iraq, Russia and Gaza, used unusually strong language to condemn the move. He said that while Israel had a right to defend its civilians against the ‘terrorist tactics’ of Hamas, this did not mean supporting all the Israeli government’s decisions. ‘The appropriation of nearly 1,000 acres of land in the West Bank near Bethlehem is utterly deplorable,’ he said. ‘Settlements are illegal under international law and will do nothing to create the kind of peace process we all want, and we urge the Israeli government to reverse this decision.’ Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said it was ‘a particularly ill-judged decision that comes at a time when the priority must be to build on the ceasefire in Gaza.’ The US also criticised the move, calling it ‘counterproductive to Israel’s stated goal of a negotiated two-state solution with the Palestinians’. Protest: Israel's actions in the West Bank have led to large-scale protests by Palestinians, like this last week . Tensions: Recent tensions have culminated in a series of heated clashes between Palestinian youths and Israeli soldiers, who remain in the occupied territory . Mr Cameron has faced criticism over his response to the crisis, in which he has staunchly backed Israel’s right to defend itself in the face of constant rocket attacks from Hamas. But he has long criticised the illegal settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where around half a million Israelis live. Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan during the Six Day War in 1967. Israel Radio said the step was taken in response to the kidnapping and killing of three Jewish teens by Hamas militants in the area in June. Tensions stoked by the incident quickly spread to Israel's border with Gaza, which is controlled by Hamas, and the two sides engaged in a seven-week war that ended on Tuesday with an Egyptian-brokered ceasefire. The notice published on Sunday by the Israeli military gave no reason for the land appropriation decision. Peace Now, which opposes Israeli settlement activities in the West Bank, territory the Palestinians seek for a state, said the appropriation was meant to turn a site where 10 families now live adjacent to a Jewish seminary into a permanent settlement. Construction of a major settlement at the location, known as 'Gevaot', has been mooted by Israel since 2000. Last year, the government invited bids for the building of 1,000 housing units at the site. Peace Now said the land seizure was the largest announced by Israel in the West Bank since the 1980s and that anyone with ownership claims had 45 days to appeal. A local Palestinian mayor said Palestinians owned the tracts and harvested olive trees on them. Israel has come under intense international criticism over its settlement activities, which most countries regard as illegal under international law and a major obstacle to the creation of a viable Palestinian state in any future peace deal. Nabil Abu Rdainah, a spokesman for Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, called on Israel to cancel the appropriation. 'This decision will lead to more instability. This will only inflame the situation after the war in Gaza,' Abu Rdainah said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu broke off U.S.-brokered peace talks with Abbas in April after the Palestinian leader reached a reconciliation deal with Hamas, the Islamist movement that dominates the Gaza Strip. In a series of remarks after an open-ended ceasefire halted the Gaza war, Netanyahu repeated his position that Abbas would have to sever his alliance with Hamas for a peace process with Israel to resume. Unstable: A spokesman for Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas (pictured), called on Israel to cancel the appropriation, saying it would lead to 'more instability' and inflame the war . At odds: President Barack Obama has been at odds with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu over settlements since taking office in 2009. This was the latest point of contention between Washington and its top Middle East ally Israel, which also differ over Iran nuclear talks . The administration of President Barack Obama, who has been at odds with Netanyahu over settlements since taking office in 2009, pushed back against the land decision. It was the latest point of contention between Washington and its top Middle East ally Israel, which also differ over Iran nuclear talks. 'We have long made clear our opposition to continued settlement activity,' said the State Department official, who declined to be identified. 'This announcement, like every other settlement announcement Israel makes, planning step they approve and construction tender they issue, is counterproductive to Israel's stated goal of a negotiated two-state solution with the Palestinians,' the official said. After the collapse of the last round of U.S.-brokered peace talks, U.S. officials cited settlement construction as one of the main reasons for the breakdown, while also faulting the Palestinians for signing a series of international treaties and conventions. Israel has said construction at Gevaot would not constitute the establishment of a new settlement because the site is officially designated a neighbourhood of an existing one, Alon Shvut, several km (miles) down the road. Some 500,000 Israelis live among 2.4 million Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, territory that the Jewish state captured in the 1967 Middle East war.","Israeli military declares 'state land, on instructions of the political echelon'

"'Humiliated': Jane Hampson (pictured) had to leave the Pi bar in Liverpool out of embarrassment after a bartender refused to serve her a small glass of wine because she was pregnant . A mother-to-be has said she was left 'humiliated' after she was refused a small glass of wine because she is heavily pregnant. Jane Hampson, 37, said she would usually enjoy one 125ml glass of red wine a week with a meal after reading research which suggested it was medically acceptable. But the Deutsche Bank worker, who is overdue with her first baby, was left dumbfounded after a barman at Pi bar, in Liverpool, told her: 'Sorry, I can't serve you.' When she asked him why, the bartender said: 'I refuse to have serving alcohol to pregnant women on my conscience.' The exchange attracted the attention of other customers at the busy bar as Miss Hampson and her partner Alistair Townend, 37, asked for an explanation. Miss Hampson said they eventually left the bar out of embarrassment and bought a glass of red wine elsewhere. The NHS currently advises pregnant women should drink no more than one to two units of alcohol once or twice a week - the equivalent of a 125ml glass of wine. As bar bosses today apologised for the snub, Miss Hampson, from Mossley Hill, Liverpool, said: 'I couldn’t believe it - it was so humiliating. 'There is no way I would endanger my unborn baby yet it was being insinuated that I was doing just that and being irresponsible. 'At the time the bar was packed and all the customers were looking over at us to see what all the commotion was about. We felt we had no choice but to leave because it was so embarrassing. Scroll down for video... The bartender at the Pi bar (pictured), in Liverpool, told Miss Hampson: 'I refuse to have serving alcohol to pregnant women on my conscience' 'The fact I am pregnant was none of his business. I appreciate a bar’s management reserve the right not to serve customers but obviously I wasn’t drunk or misbehaving or under 18 - so he had no reason not to serve me. 'I am not some Vicky Pollard-type binge drinker. I have done extensive research on the effects of drinking alcohol when pregnant and the fact is there’s nothing wrong with having a small glass of wine every week. 'I have enjoyed a small glass of red wine with a meal once a week throughout my pregnancy but it’s not been every week. 'I would describe myself as health-conscious. I have run two marathons in the past and I am not into filling my body with anything that shouldn’t be there. 'When you look at how much of an issue excess alcohol causes in this country, I really don’t feel that any establishment that chooses to profit from alcohol sales is in any position to judge anyone.' The incident occurred after Miss Hampson decided to take a long walk with Mr Townend around Liverpool’s Sefton Park on Tuesday night. After their stroll the couple, who have been together for 10 months, headed to nearby Pi bar. Research: Miss Hampson, who describes herself as health-conscious, said she has done 'extensive research on the effects of drinking alcohol when pregnant' Miss Hampson, who works as an intermediary business manager for Deutsche Bank and also runs her own website selling eco-friendly soaps and cosmetics, said: 'I asked the barman for a small glass of red wine and as soon as I said it I could see him pursing his lips as if taking a sharp intake of breath. 'I went to the toilet leaving Alistair at the bar and when I came back the barman came up to me and said he wouldn’t serve me because he couldn’t have serving a pregnant woman alcohol on his conscience. It was outrageous and embarrassing. 'We asked why but he wouldn’t budge. We went to another bar nearby and I drank a glass of wine there instead.' She added: 'Throughout my pregnancy I have taken good care of myself and made the best choices for my baby. I eat five portions of fruit and vegetables a day and make a fresh carrot, ginger and apple juice every morning. 'I don’t even use normal deodorant because I am concerned about using environmentally friendly and ethical products. 'I have read numerous articles about the effects of drinking alcohol when pregnant and I believe one small glass of wine once a week is not harmful to me or my baby. 'I had no alcohol during first 12 weeks of pregnancy apart from one glass of bubbly and one wine in that 12 week period and then, at most one glass a week, but not every week. 'It was usually with a nice meal out or on the odd occasion, like that Tuesday just after as long-a-walk as I could manage. The barman who refused to serve me was only in his 20s. It’s not up to him to decide what I should and shouldn’t be putting in my body. According to NHS guidelines, too much exposure to alcohol can seriously affect an unborn baby's development. Pregnant women are therefore advised to avoid drinking alcohol if pregnant or trying to get pregnant. For those who do choose to drink, the NHS advises not to drink more than one to two units of alcohol once or twice a week. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) advises pregnant women should avoid alcohol in the first three months in particular. Women who drink heavily during pregnancy risk their baby developing foetal alcohol syndrome. Children with this syndrome have restricted growth, facial abnormalities and learning and behavioural disorders. Source: nhs.uk . 'I felt like asking whether he refuses to serve fat people pies, or whether the bar checks how much caffeine a woman has consumed that day before they serve her a cup of coffee. 'There is recent research that suggests baldness is linked to alcohol consumption, are they going to start measuring people’s hairlines before they serve them a pint?' Ben Reynolds, area manager of Pi Bar, described the incident as an 'unfortunate misunderstanding'. He said: 'I would first and foremost like to apologise to Ms Hampson for any upset or embarrassment caused. 'I can fully understand her grievances and can completely understand why she felt upset. 'I would like to state that we have no company policy on the serving or not serving of alcohol to pregnant people. Why would we? It’s none of our business. 'What occurred was simply the result of a junior member of staff making a mistake and getting his wires crossed. 'He is deeply sorry for upsetting Ms Hampson and assures me that he was not, as I fear she believes, making a judgment on her, but rather thought for some reason, despite his training, that licensing laws forbade the serving of alcohol to pregnant people. 'However I can understand, given the unfortunate way he appears to have said it, why Ms Hampson felt he was insinuating otherwise. I would very much like to get in contact with Ms Hampson to apologise directly.'","Jane Hampson usually has one 125ml glass of red wine a week with a meal .

"Researchers have successfully carried out the first 'brain to brain' conversation online - with  participants who were 5,000 miles apart. The team transmitted signals over the internet directly from brain sensors. They were able to send the words 'hola' and 'ciao' from a location in India to a location in France. Researchers were able to send the words 'hola' and 'ciao' from a location in India (left) to a location in France (right) using internet-linked electroencephalogram (EEG) and robot-assisted and image-guided transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) sensors. In the first-of-its-kind study, an international team of neuroscientists and robotics engineers have demonstrated the viability of direct brain-to-brain communication in humans. 'We wanted to find out if one could communicate directly between two people by reading out the brain activity from one person and injecting brain activity into the second person, and do so across great physical distances by leveraging existing communication pathways,' said Alvaro Pascual-Leone, of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) and Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School. 'One such pathway is, of course, the internet, so our question became, could we develop an experiment that would bypass the talking or typing part of internet and establish direct brain-to-brain communication between subjects located far away from each other in India and France ?'' Recently published in Plos One the highly novel findings describe the successful transmission of information via the internet between the intact scalps of two human subjects – located 5,000 miles apart. Researchers using internet-linked electroencephalogram (EEG) and robot-assisted and image-guided transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) technologies. Four healthy participants, aged 28 to 50, participated in the study. One of the four subjects was assigned to the brain-computer interface (BCI) branch and was the sender of the words; the other three were assigned to the computer-brain interface (CBI) branch of the experiments and received the messages and had to understand them. Using EEG, the research team first translated the greetings 'hola' and 'ciao' into binary code and then emailed the results from India to France. There a computer-brain interface transmitted the message to the receiver's brain through noninvasive brain stimulation. The subjects experienced this as phosphenes, flashes of light in their peripheral vision. The light appeared in numerical sequences that enabled the receiver to decode the information in the message, and while the subjects did not report feeling anything, they did correctly receive the greetings. 'By using advanced precision neuro-technologies including wireless EEG and robotized TMS, we were able to directly and noninvasively transmit a thought from one person to another, without them having to speak or write,' says Pascual-Leone. 'This in itself is a remarkable step in human communication, but being able to do so across a distance of thousands of miles is a critically important proof-of-principle for the development of brain-to-brain communications. We believe these experiments represent an important first step in exploring the feasibility of complementing or bypassing traditional language-based or motor-based communication.' Previous studies on EEG-based brain-computer interaction (BCI) have typically made use of communication between a human brain and computer. In these studies, electrodes attached to a person's scalp record electrical currents in the brain as a person realizes an action-thought, such as consciously thinking about moving the arm or leg. The computer then interprets that signal and translates it to a control output, such as a robot or wheelchair. The hotspot for brain communications: This image shows the area of the brain the researchers were targeting with to trigger phosphenes, flashes of light that appeared in subjects peripheral vision. But, in this new study, the research team added a second human brain on the other end of the system. Four healthy participants, aged 28 to 50, participated in the study. One of the four subjects was assigned to the brain-computer interface (BCI) branch and was the sender of the words; the other three were assigned to the computer-brain interface (CBI) branch of the experiments and received the messages and had to understand them. Using EEG, the research team first translated the greetings 'hola' and 'ciao' into binary code and then emailed the results from India to France.

The subjects experienced this as phosphenes, flashes of light in their peripheral vision. The light appeared in numerical sequences that enabled the receiver to decode the information in the message, and while the subjects did not report feeling anything, they did correctly receive the greetings. A second similar experiment was conducted between individuals in Spain and France, with the end result a total error rate of just 15 percent, 11 percent on the decoding end and five percent on the initial coding side.","Team transmitted signals over the internet directly from brain sensors .

"The journalist’s body is then shown lying on its back in a pool of blood . The gruesome video of Steven Sotloff’s murder was almost identical to the clip of James Foley’s killing released exactly a fortnight ago. Both American journalists were clad in orange overalls, forced to kneel with their hands cuffed behind their backs and then beheaded on a barren, dusty hillside by the left-handed masked killer. The horrific but slickly-produced film of Mr Sotloff’s appalling last moments at the hands of the hooded Islamic State fanatic was uploaded to the internet yesterday evening. Scroll down for video . The gruesome video of Steven Sotloff's murder was almost identical to the clip of James Foley's killing released exactly a fortnight ago . Lasting two minutes 47 seconds, it begins with a burst of static and a clip of US President Barack Obama denouncing the execution of Mr Foley, 40, on August 19. Mr Foley’s video also started with footage of the President before cutting to the  scene of him kneeling before  his murderer. Mr Sotloff’s video cuts to what it calls A Second Message to America, subtitled in Arabic, which depicts the 31-year-old and his killer reading pre-scripted statements blaming his impending death on US foreign policy. The killer then stands behind Mr Sotloff and appears to attack him with a knife. As the murderer slashes at the captive’s neck, the film again fades to black. Seconds later, the journalist’s body is shown lying on its back in a pool of blood, his severed head placed on his stomach. The footage follows exactly the same format as Mr Foley’s murder. Both Mr Sotloff and Mr Foley appear to have been killed by the same man: a British fighter who has been dubbed 'Jihadi John' The second film ends with a chilling final image: a captured British citizen being grabbed by the scruff of his orange overalls in what appears to be the same location. The threat is obvious – he will be the next person killed. Two weeks ago, it was Mr Sotloff who appeared after Mr Foley’s beheading. Both Mr Sotloff and Mr Foley appear to have been killed by the same man: a British fighter who has been dubbed ‘Jihadi John’. He is one of four Britons fighting with IS who were  known as ‘The Beatles’ because of their accents. Their executions were both filmed in what appears to be a hilly area with a blustery wind blowing. However, in Mr Foley’s video there is a green plain in the distance below the hills and he knelt close to a dusty track. This information led computer experts to pinpoint the exact location of the killing in the uplands south of IS’s self-declared capital of Raqqa, north-west Syria.The jihadists, noted for their use of 21st century technology and social media, appear to have noticed this. Mr Sotloff’s video is filmed against a bleaker background, with far fewer geographical features – just a ridge in the background – to identify where it was shot. Although it is impossible to say when the clip of Mr Sotloff was recorded, it shows him with a small beard and some hair on his head . This differs from the film showing Mr Foley’s death, in which he was shaven-headed and clean shaven. This indicates that the videos were made at different times. It also contradicts some Western intelligence officials who suggested the men may have been murdered on the same day and the propaganda videos spaced out to generate more publicity. Mr Sotloff – a freelancer for TIME magazine among other publications – is dressed in an outfit designed to mirror those worn by detainees at Guantanamo Bay. Next to him stands the extremist dressed in black hood and robes, a smart pair of desert boots, a leather shoulder holster and clutching a knife in his left hand – exactly the same clothes and weapons as in Mr Foley’s video. Kneeling, the journalist reads his final statement with remarkable fortitude. A Second Message to America: . Taunting Obama: Sotloff's masked executioner tells the camera that the killing is in retaliation for US airstrikes in Iraq . 'I am Steven Joel Sotloff. 'I’m sure you know exactly who I am by now and why I am appearing before . you. 'And now this is the time for my message: .

'Here you are . now, Obama, nearing the end of your term, and having achieved none of . the above and deceivingly marching us the American people in the blazing . fire.' Brandishing the knife as he rants on the video, the murderer approaches Mr Sotloff from behind and snatches him by the chin. His knife apparently slashes across the victim’s neck although – just like the Foley video – there is no sign  of blood. Even though the shot lasts only seconds, the captive remains kneeling upright until his left leg shoots forward and he slumps. Again, the video then fades to black. The deeply disturbing film does not show the actual moment of Mr Sotloff’s decapitation – marking it out from earlier, less sophisticated, predecessors such as the slaying of British engineer Ken Bigley in 2004. After a few moments, the film returns to show the sickening sight of Mr Sotloff’s body lying in the dust. It then cuts to the image of  the third captive, who is set to be the next beheading victim. Again, this follows exactly the same pattern as Mr Foley’s video. The makers of the clips used multiple cameras, and professional microphones for polished production techniques – in stark contrast to earlier beheading videos circulated via the internet, which used grainy and chaotic camcorder footage. They also used graphics and visual effects, plus editing tools to cut film of Mr Sotloff with video of Obama’s press conference. The quality of the videos is unsurprising: IS boasts an estimated 2,000 recruits from Europe, many of whom are well-educated, with backgrounds in IT or film production. Executioner: . 'I’m back Obama, and I’m back because of your . arrogant foreign policy towards the Islamic state, because of your . insistence on continuing your bombings and… on Mosul Dam, despite our . serious warnings. 'You Obama, have but to gain from your actions but . another American citizen. 'So just as your missiles continue to strike . our people, our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people.

"Marco Reus scored one goal and set up another as Borussia Dortmund beat Augsburg 3-2 away on Friday for the side's first win of the new Bundesliga season. Reus opened the scoring in the 11th minute, finishing off a slick move involving Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Kevin Grosskreutz that carved open the Augsburg defense. Reus's one-two with Grosskreutz took out three Augsburg defenders before he clipped his shot coolly inside the far post. Greek defender and Arsenal target Sokratis Papastathopoulos then scored with a header from Reus's corner three minutes later.

He's back: Reus appeared to be over his recent injury problems as he scored and set one up on Friday . 'I'm just happy to be back on the pitch, to be playing football,' said Reus, who missed Germany's World Cup-winning campaign through injury. Dortmund created the lion's share of chances and substitute Adrian Ramos all but sealed the result in the 78th minute, when he pounced on a rebound after Augsburg goalkeeper Marwin Hitz saved Mkhitaryan's initial effort. However, Augsburg striker Raul Bobadilla pulled one back with eight minutes to play - after Mkhitaryan had a penalty appeal turned down - and Tim Matavz ensured a frenetic finale by scoring in the 90th minute. Target: Arsenal have been linked with defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos, who also scored against Augsburg . 'We were too focused on the penalty decision rather than what was happening on the pitch,' Dortmund defender Neven Subotic said. 'We came here with the intention to play at full throttle for the whole 90 minutes, a couple more than 90 minutes, and that didn't quite work out.' Dortmund keeper Roman Weidenfeller denied Tobias Werner an equalizer in injury time. 'A huge compliment to the side for continuing to play after it was 3-0,' Augsburg general manager Stefan Reuter said. 'Any time you score a goal the belief comes flooding back that perhaps something can be achieved.'

"(File picture) Research has found that, not surprisingly, that in the vast majority of British couples, the man was taller . Vertically challenged men get the . short end of the stick when it comes to marriage - according to research . which shows husbands overwhelmingly tend to be taller than their wives. Information on thousands of British . couples revealed, not surprisingly, that in the vast majority - 92.5 per . cent - the man was taller. Women had the edge in only 4 per cent . of the couples investigated and couples of equal height were even rarer, . making up the remaining 3.5 per cent. However, the results didn't simply reflect the average difference in height between men and women - if the couples had been randomly paired between men and women in the data then wives would have been taller than their husbands in 6 per cent of cases. British and Dutch researchers used data on more than 12,000 families from around the UK to look at height differences. The average height of the women . studied was 5ft 4.5in, while the average man reached 5ft 10in – making . him 5.5in taller than the woman in his life. The study, one of the first to look at couples, noted previous research which has shown that  women prefer taller men and men prefer their women to be shorter. However, it seems that women don’t . like their men to be too tall. In just around one in seven cases was the . man 10in or more taller than the woman. And, in an exception to the rule, very tall men tended to settle down with short women. Newcastle University researcher . Professor Daniel Nettle, said this may because at the extremes of height . simply have less choice. Professor Nettle, who collaborated . with Gert Stulp, from the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, . said that it is likely that those of around average height pair off . first, simply because they have more choice. This leaves the others with fewer potential partners to pick from. 'Pair formation, acquiring a mate to . form a reproductive unit, is a complex process. Mating preferences are a . step in this process,' the researchers said in the study published in . the journal PloS One this month. 'Mating preferences, the propensity to mate with certain phenotypes, are an important part of pair formation. 'However, due to constraining factors . such as availability of mates, rival competition, and mutual mate . choice, preferred characteristics may not be realised in the actual . partner.' The theory chimes with previous research from Mr Stulp that found that men of average height tend to father more children than their taller counterparts. Specifically, those of a middling 5ft 10.5in had 2.6 children, while one those who towered above them at 6ft 5in sired just 2.17 children, on average. The study also found women don¿t like their men to be too tall. In just around one in seven cases was the man 10 inches or more taller than the woman . Philip Cohen, professor of sociology at the University of Maryland, looked at similar data in the U.S. and found the same trends occurred there. He downloaded the 2009 Panel Study of Income Dynamics, a U.S. survey that includes height reported for 4,600 married couples. Looking at the height distributions for those couples he found a median difference of six inches. Data from the 2009 Panel Study of Income Dynamics, a U.S. survey that includes height for 4,600 couples, showed that there the average husband's height was 5ft 11in while the average wife was 5ft 5in . Professor Cohen explained that if the same people in the data set married at random, it could be expected that the husband would be taller most of the time, and that is what he did find. Plotting the results on a graph, he explained in an article in The Atlantic that the most common arrangement is the husband five to six inches taller. Only a small minority of couples — 3.8 per cent — were on the left side of the red line on Professor Cohen's graph, indicating a taller wife. Only a small minority of couples - 3.8 per cent - are on the left side of the red line on the graph, indicating a taller wife . But randomising the data showed that if couples were paired by chance alone 7.8 per cent had a taller wife . To find out whether this was because people are deliberately looking for taller-husband-shorter-wife pairings, Professor Cohen compared the actual distribution with a randomised outcome. To do this he made 10 copies of all the men and women in the data, scrambled them up, and paired them at random. Most couples still had a taller husband, but 7.8 per cent had a taller wife - nearly twice as many as in the actual results. Superimposing the two sets of data in a new graph showed that there are more couples than one would expect by chance where a man is from the same height up to 7-8in taller. And below same-height - where the woman is taller - is seen more rarely in the population as would be expected if couples were paired at random. This final graph superimposes the distribution of the actual and randomised results . Professor Cohen comments: 'Humans could couple up differently, if they wanted to. If it were desirable to have a taller-woman-shorter-man relationship, it could be much more common. 'In these data, we could find shorter husbands for 28 percent of the wives. Instead, people exaggerate the difference by seeking out taller-man-shorter-woman pairings for marriage.","In 92.5 per cent of British couples husband are taller than their wives, research shows .
Women were taller in only 4 per cent of the couples studied, while partners of equal height were even rarer .

"The Earth is definitely warming up, a large-scale independent study has concluded. The research by the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature group - which was largely composed of researchers new to . climate science, including Dr Saul Perlmutter, who recently won the . Nobel prize for physics for his work on dark energy - analysed all available temperature records. Despite it concluding that the temperature of our planet is rising, many remain sceptical of the theory that global warming is a man-made phenomenon. They say that the latest findings are simply evidence that the earth is going through cycles during which the average temperature fluctuates. The group's conclusions were clear - Earth's temperature IS rising. Their result also tallied with previous climate change studies . But Berkeley group's analysis of 1.6billion temperature reports from weather stations and ships confirmed that over the past 50 years, the world's land surface warmed by 0.911 of a degree centigrade. This tallies with previous estimates by Nasa and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The group's conclusion is not about the causes of climate change - whether due to man-made emissions or natural cycles. It's purely a statistical analysis - but a more far-reaching one than previous studies. The group's four papers are still under review by fellow scientists. Publishing them at this early stage is a highly unorthodox step. The study head, physicist Richard Muller, said there were 'legitimate issues' with previous studies, but said, 'My hope is that this will win over those people who are properly sceptical.' The researchers added 32,000 new weather stations to the existing climate data, including many more readings from Africa, Asia, South American and Antarctica . The group's approach is highly rigorous - and their algorithms are designed to deal with the inconsistent climate data provided by some weather stations, and to mathematically 'weight' data according to its accuracy. All available information has been used in the group's analysis. Previous studies have been criticised for 'pruning' data by hand. The case for climate change has also been damaged by  revelations such as 2009's . 'Climategate' when emails between University of East Anglia climate . researchers were exposed by a hacker, and included references to using . figures selectively to 'hide' a 'decline'. The group added 32,000 new weather stations to existing data, including many more readings from Asia, Antarctica, Africa and South America. Eighty per cent of earth's surface is within 200km of at least one of the stations used in the study. The worldwide approach ensures data isn't tainted by effects such as 'urban heat islands' - the warmer local climate in cities. Richard Muller, the physicist who heads the Berkeley team. Muller has described Al Gore as an 'exaggerator' and started the project after he doubted the scientific basis of previous studies . Nobel-prize winning physicist Saul Perlmutter was one of the scientists behind the recent analysis. He does not have a background in climate science. He won the Nobel this year for his work on 'dark energy' CO2 emissions by country: The Berkeley study does not offer any conclusions as to what might cause global warming - but it confirms that some form of warming effect is taking place . The research amalgamates results from 10 previous data archives, six monthly and four daily. This all-encompassing approach should, its authors say reduce 'potential bias' and 'statistical uncertainty'. The group aims, 'To merge existing surface station temperature data sets , and to review existing temperature processing algorithms for averaging, and error analysis.' The information from weather stations is often vulnerable to local conditions such as warmth from nearby buildings, or even to changes in the time of day when readings were taken. Local weather stations never 'aimed' to be part of a broader climate record, so many varied their methods for taking temperatures, creating 'blips' which previous studies simply cut out . The Berkeley group's approach allows the scientists to deal with such data without omitting readings that don't 'fit' with the overall trend. It also uses a spatial technique that estimates the readings between weather stations. The Berkeley paper merged results from ten existing data archives - four daily and six monthly - to create the most all-encompassing data archive yet . Their research uses all available . climate data, and is 'open' so that other researchers can access the . data they used, and the tools they used to make their conclusion. 'The Berkeley Earth mathematical framework allows one to include short and discontinuous temperature records, so that nearly all temperature data can be used,' says the group. 'The framework contains a weighting process that assesses the quality and consistency of a  network of temperature stations as an integral part of the averaging process. This permits data with varying levels of quality to be used without compromising accuracy.' Climate activists have criticised the . study for being funded by a group that also funds Koch Industries, . described by Greenpeace as being central to 'climate denial'. Other scientists have been critical of the decision to publish before the peer-reviewing process is finished - but researchers from other climate studies have welcomed the Berkeley group's conclusion.","Analysis of all available historical data from weather stations and ships .

"It was business as usual for Leo Messi as he scored a double on the first day of the season for the fourth consecutive campaign. Barcelona won their first game 3-0 against Elche despite Javier Mascherano’s red card just before the break. Messi’s characteristic brace was achieved without the suspended Luis Suarez and the injured Neymar but he had more than enough help from Madrid born youngster Munir El Hadaddi. The young striker will not be 19 until September 1 but already has Barça fans predicting a big future – if he can stay in the side when Neymar and Suarez return. Barcelona have now scored 26 goals in their last six opening matches and not since 2008 have they been beaten on the opening day. That front three of Munir, Rafinha and Messi was a clean sweep for the club’s La Masia youth academy as Barcelona kicked-off the season with the entire bench and six of the starters products of its youth system.

Band of brothers: Jordi Alba (R) congratulates his Barcelona teammate after sealing the 3-0 win against Elche . After just five minutes the three forwards combined with Munir playing in Messi who set up Rafinha only for him take too many touches and lose possession. Munir hit the post on 22 minutes as Elche began to creak at the back with Messi carrying on from his Gamper trophy performance against Mexican side FC Leon in Barça’s last pre-season friendly. Andres Iniesta crashed a shot on to the crossbar on the half hour and Messi was then put through by Ivan Rakitic and lobbed Przemyslaw Tyton but the flag had been raised. Munir’s decision making is what makes him stand out but on 40 minutes he made the wrong choice when put through by Messi. He should have shot but tried to find Rafinha and gave the ball away.

Youngster Munir was given a standing ovation after being substituted in the second-half . Barcelona finally got themselves in front four minutes before the break when Damian’s poor clearance went straight to Sergi Busquets and his excellent first time pass to the edge of the area played in Messi who spun and drilled his shot past Tyton for his first goal of the new season. He also scored the first goal of the campaign in 2008 and 2010 and Barcelona won the Champions League in both seasons. Elche were given some hope just before half time when Garry Rodriguez broke away for the visitors and cut across Javier Mascherano who was scampering back to clear the danger. Rodriguez tumbled as the Argentine clipped him and referee Fernando Teixeira pulled out the red card. Barcelona brought central defender Marc Bartra on at the start of the second half for Rafinha switching to a 4-3-2 formation but any sense that Elche would come back into the game evaporated when with his first shot on target in the second half Munir found the back of the net. Croatian midfielder Rakitic who must fill Xavi’s boots this season in midfield for Barcelona played a pass that the former Spain captain would have been proud of and with the outside of his left boot Munir made it 2-0. Messi made it three on 63 minutes when Alves rolled the ball across the line of the penalty area and he jigged around three white-shirted Elche defenders to make enough space for himself to shoot into the far corner. Take a bow: Luis Enrique was taking charge of a competitive game for the first time as Barcelona manager . Catch me if you can: Lionel Messi look refreshed after being given an extended break following his World Cup exertions . Next generation: Luis Enrique chose to start with youngster Rafinha Alacantra (R) as part of Barcelona's attacking threesome . Is it a bird, is it a plane? Barcelona defender Marc Nartra leaps over Elche goalkeeper Przemyslaw Tyton (R) Pedro replaced Munir on 66 minutes as Elche failed to test Barcelona’s Claudio Bravo on his home debut. Rodrgiuez wayward cross shot was typical of the visitors no-show in attack. At the other Pedro broke away and when fed by Messi drew a save from Tyton but Barcelona could not add to their lead. It was a more than satisfactory start for Luis Enrique. Debutants Munir and Rakitic had both impressed and Messi had shown that with the weight of World Cup expectation lifted from his shoulders this season he seems well on the way to getting back to his very best.

"Louis van Gaal’s decision to sell Danny Welbeck for £16m is one of the most controversial transfers in Manchester United history. On Monday night, after he scored twice in an England shirt in his first start since a deadline day transfer to Arsenal, it felt like one of the biggest mistakes they have ever made. One goal, against Switzerland in this Euro 2016 qualifier, was embarrassing enough for van Gaal. Two feels like humiliation. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's Ashton and Sale: England's pace frightening . Vital touch: Danny Welbeck pops up to open the scoring after 58 minutes in Basle . Running man: Welbeck celebrates his strike just before the hour mark . At the double: Welbeck wraps up the points for England in added time . Welbeck was one of their own at United, a homegrown talent who came through the club’s academy to become a first team player. They treated him like a son. He is Arsenal and England through and through now, that is for sure. High up in the stands, where Arsenal chief executive Ivan Gazidis was sat alongside FA chairman Greg Dyke, they were entitled to a satisfied smile. Welbeck’s double took the heat off them both. Goals pay the rent and Welbeck, who has craved the chance to start as a centre forward for club and country, duly delivered. Welbeck took his chance because of the injury to Liverpool forward Daniel Sturridge. He is the man in possession of the jersey now. You can like our Arsenal Facebook page here . Three-sy does it: Welbeck finishes off fine team move as England's forwards combine for the opener . Crowded out: Wayne Rooney attracts the attention of three Swiss players . His tail has been up for a week or so, eager to please after Arsenal held off the threat of Tottenham to sign him in the last moments leading up to the close of the transfer window. This week he will be acquainted with his new team-mates as they prepare for Saturday’s Barclays Premier League clash with Manchester City at the Emirates. He has to start. Against Switzerland, a half decent international team ranked ninth in the world, England played with speed and purpose when they surged forward. More of this please. Most of it was down to the mesmerising touches of Raheem Sterling, playing at the top of the diamond and an obvious supply line for Wayne Rooney and Welbeck up top. Tussle: Raheem Sterling and Valon Behrami battle for possession . At times it was hard to keep an eye on this attacking trident as they rotated positions and popped up all over the park. Sterling, in particular, was an absolute joy to watch. When Sterling spins off his marker, dropping deep to demand the ball off his centre-halves you know that he is comfortable playing at this level. These deep-lying missions are reminiscent of Zidane or Maradona, the little nuances that separated these two superstars of world football from the mere mortals they counted for team-mates. Sterling is picking up some good habits along the way. Not everything he does comes off, but that’s the life of a luxury player. You lose the ball, you start the cycle all over again until you win it back. Leading the line: Welbeck in action with Switzerland's Ricardo Rodriguez . Sterling is growing into his role, driving his team forward with those runs when the ball seems to bobble off his knees, shins and his boots. Somehow he remains in possession. It seems too soon to pin our hopes on the development of this little fella, but that’s what it has come down to. He looks our best bet. Sterling seems unfazed by everything around him, happy to receive the ball in any position on the field. In possession, there is an air of expectancy. When he is on the ball he makes you want to believe, as he did when he latched on to Rooney’s pass inside the area in the second half. On the run: Rooney is stopped in his tracks by Johan Djourou . Welbeck eased off his marker at the back post and arrived in time to put England ahead. The work on this trio continue when they meet up again next month for the San Marino and Estonia, but the signs are encouraging. Welbeck will be a little frustrated with his failure to find Rooney or Sterling after he mugged Switzerland left-back Ricardo Rodriguez in the first half. He should have found one of them, but his final ball let him down. Still, the bigger picture is his goalscoring contribution. Relief: Welbeck is mobbed by his England team-mates after bagging the opener . His second came in injury time, an emphatic finish beyond Yann Sommer underlined a fairly impressive England performance. In a couple of days’ time van Gaal will attempt to explain why he elected to sell Welbeck to Arsenal on deadline day. Like Welbeck’s performance for England, it will make compulsive viewing.

"A proud young dad came on the telephone from America on Tuesday night to tell us how the arrival of his first-born has given him the added motivation to up his game next month and go on to dethrone the two greatest pound-for-pound boxers in the world. Amir Khan is deep into his training camp near San Francisco. The pain of spending months apart from his wife and baby daughter will only be worth it if he beats Devon Alexander in Las Vegas on December 13 and then shocks Floyd Mayweather or Manny Pacquiao – or maybe even both – next year. Amir Khan speaks in Los Angeles ahead of his fight with Devon Alexander . The two fighters appeared in a relaxed mood as they shared the stage with Victor Oritz (C) Khan needs to defeat Alexander to set up a mega bout with either Floyd Mayweather or Manny Pacquiao . Khan insists that the birth of his daughter has inspired him to realise his full potential in his 'prime years' Khan and Alexander face each other on stage at The Conga Room ahead of their December 13 fight . ‘I’m a father now,’ says Khan. ‘I’m not only boxing for myself and my countries any longer. I’m fighting for my family. ‘It’s hard being away from home for so long. Very hard when you have a new baby.’ He will turn 28 five days before entering the ring against Alexander and says: ‘These are my prime years. I have to train even harder, dedicate myself even more, focus all the more intently. Our daughter gives me the drive for this commitment.’ Khan’s wife Faryal gave birth to little Lamaisah this May, a year after they married in New York. Khan has been inspired by the birth of his baby daughter Lamaisah in May . The 27-year-old admits that it is difficult spending time away from his wife Faryal while he is training . Khan has posted pictures of his tough work out sessions away from home with trainer Tony Brady (L) In truth not much else of major significance has happened in the life of Bolton’s former two-time world champion since the wedding. In the ring there has been just one fight, the solid and useful but hardly earth-shattering out-pointing of Luis Collazo. The professional inactivity derived from the false promise of a mega-bout with Mayweather. While he was waiting for that to happen, in vain, Khan passed up a world title challenge to Alexander last December. The American then surrendered that IBF belt to Shawn Porter, who promptly lost it to Khan’s British rival Kell Brook. Yet as Khan and Alexander finally get it on, the rewards for the victor could be bigger than any championship. Khan was denied a big money fight with Floyd Mayweather Jnr,  who took on Marcos Maidana (R) instead . Philippine boxer Pacquiao (R), pictured against Juan Manuel Marquez,  is the other name on Khan's hitlist . Khan outpointed  Luis Collazo (L) in Las Vegas earlier this year after missing out on a proposed mega-bout . British boxer Kell Brook (R) is a potential next opponent after beating Shawn Porter for the IBF belt . Khan is reluctant to look beyond this immediate foe – 'I’ve learned the hard way not to make that mistake again’ - but everyone knows that the Money Man and the PacMan are on both their horizons. Promoter Oscar De La Hoya says: ‘Absolutely, I expect the winner of this one to get the big prize next year.’ The unspoken reality is that Khan is the only one of the pair who has the profile and stature to land that massive pay-night against Mayweather or Pacquiao. He also brings with him UK pay-view-revenue. Khan, attending the Carl Froch vs George Groves fight at Wembley, can offer a UK pay-per-view audience . Khan survived a fourth round knockdown to defeat Julio Diaz at Sheffield in April 2013 . So it is to build on his box office appeal in America that he is pursuing glory over there rather than settling for loads more instant money by obliging Brook in a Wembley Battle of Britain potentially as enriching as that between Carl Froch and George Groves. ‘To be honest,’ he says, ‘Brook would be an easier fight. It was Porter’s style which helped him win that title. But beating Alexander would do more to put me back in the mix with Floyd and Manny and I always want to fight the best. Who knows? Maybe I can have Mayweather and Pacquiao in 2015.’ Maybe, with a modicum of help from little Lamaisah. Khan was beaten by Lamont Peterson by a split decision in Washington DC, December 2011 . The Bolton born boxer then followed that with an unexpected defeat by Danny Garcia in Philadelphia . ‘I can’t say I’ve been changing the nappies,’ he admits. ‘My wife and our parents have been taking care of that. But after a tough day in the gym it’s always good to get home and spend time with your child. Missing that is making me work a lot harder. Often ten times harder so I have to be careful not to overdo it.’ Despite the reversal of those back-to-back defeats by a drugged Lamont Peterson and the big punching Danny Garcia two years ago, De La Hoya remains so convinced of Khan’s potential for true greatness that he has elevated him to the top of star-studded bill at the MGM Grand Garden Arena. ‘This is an honour for me,’ says Khan. ‘My first time headlining in one of boxing’s biggest arenas.’ Khan insists it is an honour for him to be headlining at 'one of boxing's greatest arenas' Also, it is only his second fight at full welterweight and he believes he is ‘more ready’ for Alexander in this division now than he would have been a year ago. Alexander dismisses his warm-up win over Collazo as ‘just a job Amir had to do against a fading veteran.’ Khan says: ‘That was a fight I needed to settle at 147 lbs.’ He also gives credit to Alexander for ‘taking the kind of fight boxing needs more of, between two young fighters In their prime who both have a lot to lose.’","Amir Khan is set to fight Devon Alexander in Las Vegas on December 13 .

Four years ago he was also suffering niggling problems and fitness issues which limited his work in training.

"The Costa Concordia wreck has become highly lucrative for some locals in Genoa after it was towed into the southern Italy city recently to be scrapped. Despite previous criticism of those cashing in on the tragic cruise liner by offering rooms and restaurants with a view of the wreck, opportunistic residents are now also offering boat tours around the stricken vessel. The Concordia has been turned into the latest 'dark tourism' destination, as tourists flock to see it while it waits to be cut up for scrap metal. Lucrative: The wreck of the Costa Concordia has become the latest 'dark tourism' destination as tourists flock to see it before it is demolished in Genoa . Tragedy: 32 were killed when the cruise liner capsized in January 2012 off the island of Giglio in Italy . The tour boats go within 200 metres of the cruise liner as a guide recounts the story of the tragedy, in which 32 people died after it struck a reef when its captain sailed too close to Giglio Island off Tuscany's coast in January 2012. The wreck was set upright in September 2013 and it took five days to drag it to Genoa, headquarters of ship owner Costa Crociere S.p.A and the port where the luxury vessel first set sail after construction in 2005. The tourist offers are unlikely to end any time soon, as the gradual demolition and scrapping will take an estimated two years. Cashing in: Some locals in the city of Genoa are offering £8 boat tours of the stricken vessel as well as advertising 'rooms with a view' of the wreck . At least one local restaurant has been spotted handing out flyers promising the best views of the stricken liner, and local hostels have also been offering bedrooms with a view. Now tourists can also take guided tours on a mini cruise around the wreck for 10 Euros (8 GBP) a time. Even Francesco Schettino - dubbed 'Captain Coward' for allegedly abandoning ship while passengers were still on board and who is being tried for manslaughter over the deaths - has been taking advantage of the international attention by offering a lecture to university students on the best emergency practices to use in a disaster situation. Demolition: It will take two yours to cut up the vessel for scrap metal . Despite criticism of the advertising campaign from La Vetta restaurant in Genoa, business has been booming with diners wanting to take a view of the ship. On the flyers the restaurant boasted: 'From our terrace you'll catch a great view of the Costa Concordia.' The ship claimed another life in February this year when one of the rescue divers working to salvage the ship bled to death after cutting his leg on metal in the water, bringing the death toll to 33.","Stricken vessel was towed into Genoa recently to be demolished .

"A brave moggy, called Sally, has received hero status after it saved its owner from his burning home. 49 year old Craig Jeeves was alerted to the fire in his Wandin North home in Melbourne early Monday morning when his pet cat screamed at him and woke him up. It allowed the man to realise the danger he was in before he managed to escape his burning home. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Hero cat 'Sally' saves her owner Craig Jeevse (pictured) from his burning house . Craig Jeeves was alerted to the fire in his Wandin North home in Melbourne early Monday morning when his pet cat screamed at him and woke him up. 'She jumped on my head and was screaming at me,' he told the Nine Network. CFA operations manager Jason Lawrence said it was just after one o'clock this morning the brigade from Wandin responded to the fire. Fire Crews, who found Mr Jeeves in the bushes outside his home when they arrived, said he was very lucky to be alive. 'The building was largely involved in fire, flames were coming out of the window and walls,' he said. The size of the fire meant the unit had to call for backup. Craig Jeeves hugs his cat 'Sally' after she saved him from his burning house . 'She jumped on my head and was screaming at me,' owner Craig Jeeves told the Nine Network. 'The CFA proceeded to fight the fire from the exterior and hosing down the building. Then neighbouring crews arrived with breathing apparatus.' It took fire crews more than half an hour to put out the blaze. There was fairly extensive damage, with an estimated 70 to 80 percent of the house gutted. 'The cause is being investigated but it's looking like possibly a heating appliance.' Mr Lawrence said. The cat's owner, Mr Jeeves, lost everything but escaped relatively unharmed. He was treated for minor shock and smoke inhalation and will be staying with neighbours until he is able to rebuild the property. 'I'm happy to be alive but you can't replace the memories,' he said.

"Forget dating websites or being set up by friends, a woman has revealed she met the love of her life thanks to her Playstation - that was bought for her by her cheating ex. Kelly Murray, 22,  from Lochgelly, Fife, was devastated when her long term partner confessed he had been unfaithful so she ended their relationship. In an attempt to win back her forgiveness, he bought her the games console. But while she accepted the gift, Kelly couldn't trust him again and found solace in playing Call of Duty as she adjusted to single life. Love game: Kelly met Paul thanks to playing Call of Duty and they are now engaged with a son . And while the game involving warfare may not sound very romantic, it led Kelly to meet a new man. As her expertise on the game grew, she found herself chatting with other players online including mechanic Paul Abbey, 24, who called her a 'show off' after she thrashed him in one online head-to-head cyber battle. Gift: Kate was given the Playstation by her ex after he cheated on her (posed by model) Kelly explained: 'I was heartbroken when my . long term boyfriend told me he had cheated on me. He moved out taking . his Playstation with him but came round a few days later with a . replacement as a present and asked me to take him back. 'While we had lived together, he had . always been playing the Playstation and it really drove me crazy. 'But . when I started to get into it I realised I was actually quite good. When I got a message from a player calling me a show off it made me . laugh and we started talking.' Kelly and Paul agreed to meet in person in October 2010 and love quickly blossomed between the pair. They were engaged four months later and are now the proud parents of eight-month-old son Owen. 'Everything moved really quickly with Paul and pretty quickly we were moving in together.' Kelly said. 'Then we got engaged and had our little boy Owen. We really couldn't be happier and guess I have the Playstation to thank for that.' Call centre worker Kelly and Paul are now planning to tie the knot next year and hope to include a Playstation theme in their wedding. Not very romantic: Call of Duty is a game of warfare. Kelly met Paul when they linked up to play one another online . Kelly said: 'It really has been such a fairy-tale for us. Maybe because we met in a fantasy world but it became a reality for us. 'We are both really excited about getting married. And you never know, we may just throw a little Playstation tribute in there.' Paul added: 'I did think Kelly was a show off the first time I was playing against her and she won but I'm glad I told her so. Things have worked out great for us and we are both very happy.'","Kelly Murray was devastated when she discovered boyfriend had been unfaithful .

"Jon Voight says he couldn't be happier that his daughter Angelina Jolie and Brad PItt are married. The veteran actor told Good Morning Britain that he is proud to call Brad his son-in-law during a telephone interview on Friday morning. 'I'm very happy that I can legitimately call him my son-in-law, this wonderful fellow who I love, Jon, 75, said. Scroll down for video . In the dark: Jon Voight, pictured over the weekend in LA, did not know his daughter Angelina Jolie had married Brad Pitt in a top-secret ceremony in France on Saturday . 'You know what they are very happy.The kids must have had a wonderful time at the wedding, they all had their things to do and it must have been very beautiful so I'm very happy for them. ' He added that they are planning to see each other soon: 'She's working now with Brad, and I've got  a couple of things to do, but as soon as we can we'll get together and it's going to be exciting.' Jon had told MailOnline that he was planning to fly to Europe to join Angelina and her new husband Brad Pitt, having only found out they were married on Thursday morning. 'I'm going to Europe to see them all this week, I've been waiting a long time for this wedding to happen, everything is cool, I'm very happy,' the Ray Donovan star said. Angelina and Brad would soon be headed to Malta where they are filming their new movie By The Sea. All good now: Angelina Jolie famously reconciled with her dad Jon Voight in 2010 after a rift left them estranged for nearly a decade, pictured in LA in 2011 . And Voight added he was up for a bit of baby sitting to allow the Pitts some alone time. Speaking about his three-times married daughter's choice in men - she was previously married to actors Jonny Lee Miller and Billy Bob Thornton - he said: 'Well, she's been together with Brad for a while, so they must be happier than she was with the other husbands . 'I really like Brad, we get to bond by playing golf together.' The Hollywood star said he can't wait to see his grandchildren, but said he wanted to make sure that Angelina looked after her health following her double mastectomy operation. Was her brother there? Jon Voight attended an Emmy after-party with his son and Angie's sibling James Haven . When asked if he was upset at not being invited to the wedding on Saturday, Voight said: 'I'm not disappointed, I understand. 'The children have been bugging them for a long time to get married and the time was right.' And in any case, the actor had to go to the Emmys on Monday night, where he was nominated for Best Supporting Actor in a drama for Ray Donovan. Voight also attended the Creative Arts Emmys a week earlier, and he was joined by his son and Angelina's brother James Haven, though it's unclear if her sibling was at the wedding. E! today reported that Brad and Angelina spent most of this week enjoying their honeymoon together, surrounded by their six children. ""The honeymoon was a few days enjoying Miraval and how much space they have now,' a source said. 'The kids went quad biking and swimming on the afternoon of the wedding and that night they all had pizza in the garden. The whole thing was very Brad and Angie. They're low key and much more about romantic gestures than they are about having a big, flashy multi-million dollar wedding.' Despite a previously somewhat fractious relationship with Angelina, Voight said that he often got to see his grandchildren and spend time with his daughter and her family. His comments came hours after he woke up to the news his daughter had got married on Saturday in France - and could only say 'that's nice' when confronted by Inside Edition. Voight and the 39-year-old actress were estranged for nearly a decade but famously reconciled in 2010. They famously fell out in 2001 after the actor told Access . Hollywood that his daughter had 'serious mental problems' and pleaded . with her to seek help. An upset Jolie responded with a public statement saying she did not think it was 'healthy' for her to be around her father. Relations had apparently already become strained after Jolie learned Voight had had an affair behind her mother's back. Intimate affair: Pitt's family were in attendance. The couple are pictured together in May . Voight . later revealed that the reconciliation occurred after he was struck by an . emotional epiphany, leading the Oscar-winner to change his attitude 'in . a moment'. He . said he now lives for his family and in 2011, he said: '‘I suddenly saw . things differently and everything shifted. That one moment changed my . whole life. 'It . gave me back my daughter and my family. Being reunited with my Angie is . very precious to me. I adore my grandchildren, they are my great love. It makes me so emotional and grateful. The E! insider added that the Hollywood heavyweights will most likely 'donate some money to charity to celebrate this milestone.' Where it happened: The wedding took place at the couple's residence, Chateau Miraval, in France over the weekend . 'It was a beautiful few days. Brad is now in England while Angelina is in Gozo preparing for shooting on the movie they're doing together.' And aside from their recent relaxing days at home, we're told that the two won't be embarking on a special one-on-one trip to celebrate anytime son. 'They say their life has been one long honeymoon. They've always been very romantic and will keep celebrating this wonderful happy time in their lives for as long as they can.' Jolie and Pitt arrived in Nice on Saturday for their nuptials, believed to have been held at Chateau Miraval. Jolie reportedly walked down the aisle with her eldest sons Maddox, 13, and Pax, 10, on each arm while her daughters Zahara and Vivienne threw petals, and Shiloh and Knox served as ring bearers. The secret wedding seems to have been a quiet affair although Brad's brother Doug Pitt, sister Julie Neal and their respective families are believed to have been there.

"The little girl who was brutally stabbed 19 times by two friends obsessed with the fictional Slender Man has returned to school after a difficult summer of doctors appointments, surgeries and healing. The 12-year-old started seventh grade on Tuesday after her sixth grade years was cut short when she was lured into the woods and allegedly attacked by Morgan Geyser and Anissa Weier. A family spokesman revealed to WITI-TV that the girl - whose name has not been revealed - has been excited to go back to school for weeks. Scroll down for video . Healing: The Slender Man victim is back in school after the horrendous attack by two classmates last May. She has received an outpouring of support from the community . Cult: The girl was attacked by her friends who were obsessed by the Slender Man, a fictional character in spooky online stories. They claimed they thought he was real . He said the summer has been difficult for her and her family. She has undergone dozens of doctors visits - sometimes ten a week - surgeries, and counseling appointments. 'Throughout the summer, the parents would write on a grocery list, and put down groceries, and at the bottom of the list she’d always write ‘school supplies.’ Every week: ‘school supplies’ - so she wanted to get back to school. She was excited about it,” Stephen Lyons said. On May 31, Geyser and Weier lured her into the woods in Waukesha - a Milwaukee suburb - after a sleepover. They held their girl down and stabbed and slashed her 19 times then left her for dead, according to police. She crawled out of the woods and flagged down a passerby. Medics found her bloody and covered in wounds to her legs, arms and torso. Charged: Morgan Geyser (left) and Anissa Weier (right) were charged as adults for the brutal attack. Geyser was later found not mentally competent to stand trial . The girls later told cops that they attacked their friend to prove their devotion to Slender Man - a fictional character from spooky online stories. The girls said they believed was real. Geyser and Weier were arrested and charged as adults with attempted murder. The girl's recovery from the attack has been intensive and arduous, including a long list of specialists and surgeries. 'A typical week, for weeks at a time, eight or 10 doctors appointments,' Mr Lyons told WITI. The girl's medical bills are expected to reach more than $400,000. Supporters have started a GoFundMe page to assist with expenses.

"David Cameron was yesterday pushing for tougher sanctions to strike at the heart of Russia’s economy over its incursion into Ukraine – even if they risk hurting the City. Downing Street admitted that targeting lending to sectors such as oil could have an impact on London’s financial heart. But the Prime Minister’s spokesman said it was right to put pressure on President Vladimir Putin over his military aggression. Scroll down for videos . Russian President Vladimir Putin was in Mongolia today, but is facing increasing isolation in Europe over Moscow's military intervention in Ukraine . All at sea: The Vladivostok aircraft carrier, which was being built in France, has now been axed after continued fighting in Ukraine . This may well have an impact on the financial sector in London and other capitals, he said. ‘But, as the Prime Minister and Chancellor have said, the costs of the sanctions fall much more greatly on Russia than they do on the rest of the world. ‘Russia needs Europe and others more than the other way around on these commercial issues.’ The development came as France finally bowed to pressure and cancelled the delivery of the first of two warships to Russia. The Vladivostok, a Mistral-class helicopter carrier ordered in the £960million deal, was due to be delivered by late October. French President Francois Hollande’s office called the fighting in Ukraine ‘grave’ and said that Russia’s recent actions in Ukraine harm ‘the foundations of security in Europe’. Britain, France and Germany are all in favour of tougher EU sanctions if the Kremlin refuses to call off incursions into its smaller neighbour. In Brussels, EU ambassadors have begun work on the new measures, including a threat to strip Russia of the right to host the 2018 football World Cup. But the central proposal was a ban on all state-controlled oil and defence firms from raising capital in European markets. David Cameron has hit out at the Russian military presence in eastern Ukraine, but has yet to back proposals to exclude the country from sporting occasions . US President Barack Obama was in Estonia today and condemned the situation in Ukraine . This could have a dramatic effect by halting investment in these key sectors. The Russian economy is already stalling thanks to existing sanctions, and the rouble is at a record low. A document in Brussels out- lining the plans added: ‘Besides economic measures, thought could be given to taking co-ordinated action to recommend suspension of Russian participation in high-profile international events (Formula One races, UEFA football competitions, 2018 World Cup etc).’ However, Number 10 officials suggested that Britain was less enthusiastic about the idea of trying to strip Russia of football’s top tournament. ‘The Prime Minister’s focus is around political and economic measures that have an impact now,’ said the spokesman. Meanwhile President Barack Obama was yesterday in Estonia to reassure the Baltic states that they would be protected by Nato. The US leader declared that ‘borders cannot be redrawn at the barrel of a gun’. He also warned Mr Putin that the alliance would not accept Russian annexation of ‘any part of Ukraine’. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said he has agreed a ‘ceasefire process’ with Moscow. Later Mr Putin commented that he hoped a peace deal could be reached by tomorrow during talks in Minsk between his country, Ukraine and separatist rebels. The Nato summit, which is being held in Wales today and tomorrow, is expected to discuss the alliance’s response to the crisis in Ukraine.","Brussels has announced proposals to step up sanctions against Moscow .

"The American doctor who made a miraculous recovery from a battle with Ebola has spoken out in his first sit-down interview while recovering at home with his wife and three children. Dr Kent Brantly was treating Ebola patients in Liberia at the end of July, during what is currently the largest outbreak of the disease ever,  when he first started showing signs of the deadly disease. The 33-year-old and another infected missionary worker were transported out of the country in early August for treatment at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, where both were able to beat the disease with the help  of an experimental new serum called ZMapp. Dr Brantly sat down with NBC's Matt Lauer this week to discuss the life-threatening experience that propelled him into the national spotlight, in an interview taped in Asheville, North Carolina where he is living in seclusion with his family. Scroll down for videos . What it's like to fight Ebola: Dr Kent Brantly (pictured above in an interivew with NBC) caught Ebola while working in Liberia in July, but made a miraculous recovery and has since been discharged from the hospital . The physician says he first started feeling symptoms of the disease at the end of July,  when he came down with a low fever that made him feel 'a little off - a little warm, a little under the weather'. At first, he hoped it was malaria or dengue fever, but the results kept coming back negative until he was eventually tested for Ebola. The positive test means death for more than 90 per cent who catch the disease, but Dr Brantly says he never lost faith even when doctors started to fear he wouldn't make it through the night. The disease quickly took hold in Liberia, when he started struggling to breathe and his body was overcome with shaking and violent shivers. 'And I said to the nurse who was taking care of me, ""I'm sick. I have no reserve. And I don't know how long I can keep this up."" And I said, ""I don't know how you're going to breathe for me when I quit breathing."" Hope: Dr Brantly was flown out of Liberia at the beginning of August, for treatment at Emory University Hospital. Pictured above walking out of an ambulance outside the Atlanta, Georgia hospital . 'Cause that was the reality. I thought, ""I-- I'm not gonna be able to continue breathing this way."" And they had no way to breathe for me if I had to quit breathing,' Dr Brantly recalled. Hope finally arrived early last month, when Dr Brantly and fellow missionary worker Nancy Writebol, 59, were flown out of Liberia for treatment at Emory. The two Americans were the first to receive ZMapp which helped them fight off the disease. Within just a few weeks, both were discharged from the hospital after testing negative for Ebola in their blood. Ebola free: Dr Brantly was one of the first to receive an experimental serum called ZMapp which helped him fight off the disease. He is pictured above being discharged from the hospital on August 21, holding his wife Amber's hand . Victory: Over ninety per cent of those who catch Ebola die from the deadly disease. Above, Dr Brantly high-fives the medical staff who treated him at Emory as he was discharged last month . Dr Brantly's mind is still very much on the outbreak after news broke Wednesday that yet another American doctor has caught Ebola. Dr Brantly worked with the latest victim at the same hospital in Liberia, and told Lauer that he spent most of the morning praying for his friend. The doctor has not yet been named publicly. Now that he is Ebola-free, Dr Brantly looks back and says he was most lucky his wife and children weren't in the country when he started showing symptoms. His family  left the country a few days before to attend a wedding in Texas. 'I was so thankful that Amber and the kids were not there. Yeah, I wanted to be close to them. But that gave me great relief, knowing they were gone three days before I had any symptoms,' he said. 'That would have been an overwhelming mental burden, if I had woken up sick next to my wife with one of my kids snuggled up next to me.' In the interview, Dr Brantly looked thin and pale but appeared to be healthy and energized. 'Right now I still have a lot of recovering to do,' he said. 'I know I look well but I am still pretty weak.' Long road: Dr Brantly looked thin and pale, but otherwise healthy in his NBC interview. He says he still has a lot of recovering to do .","Dr Kent Brantly caught Ebola in July while working in Liberia .

"Three Canadians were among the Islamist fighters who help two American journalists hostage in Syria for two years, a new report reveals. Theo Curtis and Matt Schrier have both been freed after being held together by al-Nusra Front,  the al-Qaeda-affiliated terrorist group  fighting in Syria. The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. has revealed that three of the men who brutally beat, intimidated and robbed the journalists were Canadian citizens - proving that ISIS does not have a monopoly on foreign fighters traveling to Syria for jihad. Theo Curtis and Matt Schrier have both been freed after being captured in between 2011 and 2013 by al-Nusra Front. Canadian jihadists were among their tormentors . Citing unnamed sources, the CBC reports that the Canadians forced the men to hand over their bank details, PINs and passwords then drained their accounts of their life savings. The Canadian captors then sadistically wrote emails to Mr Curtis and Mr Schriers' friends and family claiming to be the men and begged them for their bank details. The militants then preyed on the journalists' friends and family, as well. Schrier escaped from his al-Nusra Front prison last year after seven months in captivity. He described how he and Mr Curtis, his cellmate, were brutally beaten on their feet with wire cables. Mr Curtis was free last week after the Qataris helped secure his safety following the brutal murder of journalist James Foley at the hands of ISIS. Brutal: Al-Nusra Front, an al-Qaeda-affiliated group, is also apparently stocked with foreign fighters. At least 130 Canadians - and as many as 300 - have joined foreign Islamist groups (stock picture) ISIS beheaded journalist Steven Sotloff in a similarly barbaric video that was released online Tuesday. The Canadian government has acknowledged that Canadians have been leaving the country to join jihadist groups - putting the number at about 130. However, a CBC investigation has revealed that as many as 300 Canadian citizens are fighting with Islamist organizations in Syria and Iraq. Al-Nusra Front was regarded as one of the most radical and violent Islamist groups fighting in the Syrian Civil War until the rise of ISIS - whose methods were so brutal that even al-Qaeda has distanced itself.","Up to 300 Canadians are fighting on the side of Islamist groups in Iraq and Afghanistan .

"Apple's iPad has been a huge hit among children, with its easy to use interface and innovative apps. In fact, researchers say the astonishing rise of the iPad has meant is has now overtaken household names such as McDonalds and Disney to become the number one brand among American 6-12 year olds. The annual study, conducted by leading youth and family research firm Smarty Pants, ranks more than 250 brands each year. In the firm's 2014 study, Apple's iPad trumps iconic kid brands such as McDonald's, Toys'R'Us, Nickelodeon, and Disney. Young Love is conducted online among a representative sample of U.S. households with children ages 6-12. In 2014, a total of 256 consumer brands across more than 20 categories were evaluated as part of the three-month study of 6,661 children and their parents. The scores, called Kidfinity, are a composite measure on a scale of 0-1000 that factor in brand awareness, love and popularity. 'iPad's number one status among kids represents the culmination of the 'tablet takeover' – a movement from shared screens and TV network dominance to curated content on personal devices,' said Wynne Tyree, president of Smarty Pants. 'Kids increasingly turn to iPad for games, TV shows, videos, books, homework help and communicating with friends and family.' In the firm's 2014 study, Apple's iPad trumps iconic kid brands such as McDonald's, Toys'R'Us, Nickelodeon, and Disney. Kids see the iPad as the all-in-one digital tool, giving them a unique sense of independence, the researchers say. Tyree notes that iPad's march to the top has been dramatic. 'In just five years, the iPad has risen from ranking 109th to being kids' favorite brand. 'Early on, it captured the hearts of tweens and middle and upper class families, but iPad is now an indispensable part of childhood for the masses.' Over all, on the study iPad was tops with a weighted score of 898 out of 1000. The Apple tablet was followed by Hershey’s (894), Oreo (885), M&M’s (883), Doritos (868), Cheetos (864), with Skittles and Disney tied at 858. Google’s YouTube came in at 852, followed by Microsoft Xbox (850); Lay’s (847); Kit Kat and Nickelodeon (846); Crayola (842); McDonald’s (839); Nintendo Wii (838); and Reese’s, Chips Ahoy! and iPod tying at 836. Netflix came in at 833, followed by iPhone (830), Toys ‘R’ Us (830) and Apple (829). The iPad's popularity has even led to accesories aimed at toddlers such as the iPotty for iPad potty training device. Digital entertainment overall is seeing a surge among kids and families, with brands such as Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Instant Video, Android, and Samsung posting noteworthy increases in  the study, a measure of kids' awareness, popularity, and love for a brand. Along with iPad, these devices and services provide entertainment that is 'always on.' Offering seemingly endless options, tablets and digital content providers are meeting contemporary kids' needs – with fun and connectivity never more than a tap away.","iPad named as most popular brand among young children .

"Liverpool will provide the perfect environment for Mario Balotelli to thrive as he will no longer have to be a leader, according to his agent. In an interview with Italian newspaper Corriere dello Sport, Mino Raiola said Balotelli was not born to be a leader and that Liverpool’s captain Steven Gerrard will protect the striker and allow him the freedom to concentrate on firing Brendan Rodgers’ side to the title. ‘I searched for a team where he can be an important player without being asked to lead,’ said Raiola, who also represents Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Paul Pogba.

Under pressure: Balotelli's agent Mino Raiola thinks the 24-year-old will be free to score goals at Liverpool . ‘Liverpool have Gerrard so Mario will be protected and there he will be at his best. Now it's up to him. Another flop is not recommended. ‘Not everyone is born to be a leader and often good strikers are not good leaders. Mario needs to get out from behind this pressure so he can feel free to score goals.’ When asked if Liverpool was Balotelli’s last resort, Raiola said: ‘At the highest level, yes.

Pedigree: Balotelli led the line for Italy at the World Cup in Brazil but they crashed out at the group stage . Raiola, who was speaking to Corriere dello Sport via Skype from Manchester Airport, said Liverpool had been watching Balotelli for three months after it became clear the striker needed to cut his ties with AC Milan. ‘Balotelli’s contract will be completed on Monday or Tuesday. I still have so many little things to fix. Today (Saturday), meanwhile, Mario has his medical. ‘The negotiations have been very smooth and fair. They have been going on for three months.

But he insisted when he left Manchester City that he wanted to go to Milan. ‘I cannot blame Milan for anything. It is a great club. Mario played well for six or seven months, gave a decisive contribution in getting them to the Champions League, but then we saw that he is not ready to be a leader.’","Balotelli's agent, Mino Raiola, says Liverpool is the former Manchester City forward's last chance at highest level, after an up-and-down spell at AC Milan .

"Tiger Woods has split with his swing coach Sean Foley after a miserable year beset by injuries and a winless run in major championships that now stretches back to the 2008 US Open. The 38-year-old superstar has worked with Foley since 2010 but won no major titles under his tutelage, compared with a combined 14 under his previous two coaches Butch Harmon and Hank Haney. After seeming destined to overhaul Jack Nicklaus's all-time record of 18 majors, Woods has not won one of golf's four big titles for six years while struggling to deal with a catalogue of serious injuries. Woods has worked with Foley in a continued attempt to put less stress on his notoriously damaged left knee but back problems have become his main concern.

Woods underwent surgery on a herniated disc in March but endured a torrid return to the course, completing his worst 72-hole finish at a major at The Open in July. He also missed the cut at the US PGA Championship as it became clear his back problems had not sufficiently healed. 'I'd like to thank Sean for his help as my coach and for his friendship,' Woods said in a statement on his website. 'Sean is one of the outstanding coaches in golf today, and I know he will continue to be successful with the players working with him.' Foley has enjoyed considerable success with other players under his guidance, notably England's former US Open champion Justin Rose and Hunter Mahan, who won The Barclays tournament in New Jersey on Sunday, part of the lucrative FedEx Cup play-offs. Off course: Woods has had an awful year, culminating in his missing the cut at the US PGA Championship . Pain: The 14-time major champion has been plagued by back problems this year . But Woods, who earlier this month pulled out of the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles in order to let his back recover, has decided to part company with one of the most sought-after swing coaches in the world. Woods is not scheduled to play until his own tournament in Florida in the first week of December and has used his break from the course to change a key man in his team. 'With my next tournament not until my World Challenge event at Isleworth in Orlando, this is the right time to end our professional relationship,' added Woods. Woods's splits from both Harmon and Haney have ended in acrimony but Foley insisted that the duo are parting on good terms. 'My time spent with Tiger is one of the highlights of my career so far, and I am appreciative of the many experiences we shared together,' Foley said in a statement. 'It was a lifelong ambition of mine to teach the best player of all-time in our sport. I am both grateful for the things we had the opportunity to learn from one another, as well as the enduring friendship we have built. I have nothing but respect and admiration for him.' VIDEO Tiger Woods leaves Sean Foley . Grimace: Woods winces as he completes a drive at the US PGA earlier this month . Despite his six-year duck in majors, Woods did enjoy a superb year in 2013 in which he won five times. Despite that success, Woods's struggles with his driver in particular have been all too obvious, which has earned Foley some stern criticism. Golf Channel commentator Brandel Chamblee, a former PGA Tour player, has been a notable critic, even accusing Woods of developing the 'yips' with his driver. Harmon, who was Woods's coach during the star's 'Tiger Slam' of four successive major wins from the 2000 US Open to the 2001 Masters, reacted to the news by defending Foley. 'In Sean’s defense, I had the easiest job in my 10 years,' said Harmon. 'He was the healthiest. Sean had the hardest job.' Rose also backed his coach during an interview with the Golf Channel’s Jason Sobell in New Jersey last week. ‘I think with Tiger they’ve had to work around a lot of things,’ he said. ‘It’s probably very frustrating for Tiger and it’s probably very frustrating for Sean. ‘There are definitely moves that Sean is trying to get out of there that are compromising his health.’","Tiger Woods has announced he has parted with swing coach Sean Foley .

Under the War Powers Resolution of 1973, the White House can't send the U.S. military into armed conflict for more than 60 days without congressional authorization. That clock will run out on October 7. President Obama said Wednesday in Estonia that fighting ISIS 'is not going to be a one-week or one-month or six-month proposition.' Royce and Engel, the Daily Beast reported, said that in the wake of a second gruesome video showing the beheading of an American journalist, they're determined to make sure the administration is proceeding in a way that Congress approves of. Virginia Republican Rep. Frank Wolf went one step further on Wednesday, unveiling a bill that he will soon introduce to authorize ongoing military force against ISIS and other Islamist terror groups. The proposed legislation would permit Obama 'to use all necessary and appropriate force against those countries, organizations, or persons associated with or supporting terrorist groups, including al-Qaeda and its regional affiliates, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, al Shabaab, Boko Haram, and any other emerging regional terrorist groups that share a common violent extremist ideology.' His goal, articulated in the bill, is 'to eliminate all such terrorist groups.' A separate bill drafted by Florida Sen. Bill Nelson would give President Obama the legal authority to carry out airstrikes on ISIS in Syria. 'Let there be no doubt, we must go after ISIS right away because the U.S. is the only one that can put together a coalition to stop this group that’s intent on barbaric cruelty,' the Democratic lawmaker said in a statement. Both Wolf and Nelson intend to file their legislation next week when Congress reconvenes after a month-long recess. Flashpoint: Video released Tuesday by the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) showed American journalist Steven Sotloff (left) next to an unknown jihadi shortly before his execution . Engel (left) and Royce (right) were on the air Tuesday as news of Sotloff's execution reached CNN . Wolf . said Wednesday that 'for far too long the Obama Administration and the . Congress have been debating whether or not authority exists for action . to address this threat.' 'We cannot continue operating on outdated authorities passed 13 years ago; it is time for this Congress to vote,' he said. Wolf's . bill includes a sop to dovish Democrats in the form of a requirement . that the president must act with 'the close consultation, coordination, . and cooperation with NATO and regional allies.' At the . heart of lawmakers' concerns is the thorny question of whether Obama . will authorize airstrikes against ISIS in Syria as well as Iraq. 'We . anticipate there will be a vote on authorization of the use of force . for such a plan,' Royce said Tuesday. 'That would come within the 60-day . window.' Engel . agreed. 'We believe that before the president can continue beyond 60 . days of doing airstrikes in Iraq or anyplace else, he would have to come . to Congress and get Congress’s authority to continue,' he said. The president admitted last Thursday that 'we don't have a strategy yet' for that . The confession elicited gasps from lawmakers from the president's own political party. Minnesota Sen. Al Franken said on Tuesday in a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder that he was 'troubled' by Obama's admission. In a statement released Tuesday Virgina Sen. Mark Warner called on the president to present Congress 'with a clear strategy and political and military options for eliminating the ISIL threat.' 'The United States should not take any military options off the table, because stopping ISIL is in the national security and foreign policy interests of the U.S. and our European allies,' Warner's statement read. Obama has unequivocally said the U.S. will not put combat boots on the ground in Iraq to fight Islamic extremists. On Wednesday in Estonia, after nearly a week-long media feeding frenzy that delivered one PR black eye after another, the president tried to clarify what he meant by his no strategy remark. 'I was specifically referring to the possibility of the military strategy inside of Syria that might require congressional approval,' he said during a press conference. 'It is very important from my perspective that when we send our pilots in to do a job, that we know that this is a mission that's going to work, that we're very clear on what our objectives are, what our targets are; we've made the case to Congress and we've made the case to the American people; and we've got allies behind us so that it's not just a one-off, but it's something that over time is going to be effective.' Mixed messages: John Kerry met with newly appointed envoy to Muslim communities Shaarik Zafar (right) during a State Department ceremony on Tuesday . Royce . also told reporters on Tuesday that he and Engel plan on 'scheduling a . hearing upon our return and requesting the secretary of state to present . a plan, a strategy focused on rolling back ISIS, defeating ISIS through . the use of airstrikes and the support of those with common interests.' Georgia GOP Sen. Saxby Chambliss, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, joined the impatience caucus on Wednesday by insisting that 'the United States must destroy ISI[S] now.' 'The West cannot continue to stand by while this group continues to kill innocent persons, as it has already done with the appalling murders of James Foley and Steven Sotloff,' he said. 'The time to stop and destroy ISIL is now.' Secretary . of State John Kerry took nearly 24 hours to comment on Sotloff's death, . saying in a statement Wednesday morning that it was 'an act of medieval . savagery by a coward hiding behind a mask.' His . emailed statement came shortly before he presided over a ceremony to . honor Shaarik Zafar, his special envoy to U.S. Muslim communities. 'For . so many who worked so long to bring Steven and the other Americans home . safely, this was not how the story should've ended,' Kerry said. 'Its a . punch to the gut. '[T]hose . who have murdered James Foley and Steven Sotloff in Syria,' he vowed, . 'should know that the United States will hold them accountable too, no . matter how long it takes.' Royce (left) and Engel (right) met with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu (center) on Tuesday in Israel . But Royce, the more hawkish of the two congressmen who spoke to reporters Tuesday, stopped short of calling for massive bombing campaigns trailing through Syrian airspace. That could indicate that Kerry and other Obama administration officials will have a hard time justifying additional airstrikes without also arming anti-ISIS groups on the ground. The White House needs to 'accelerate this process,' Royce said, suggesting that the U.S. should be arming the moderate Free Syrian Army to fight ISIS. He also criticized the administration for its plodding approach to arming the Kurdish Peshmerga army in northern Iraq. Obama said Wednesday that the primary U.S. objective 'is to degrade and destroy' ISIS 'so that it’s no longer a threat not just to Iraq but also the region and to the United States.' But in the same press conference, he said a successful American effort in the region would 'shrink' the group's 'sphere of influence, its effectiveness, its financing, its military capabilities to the point where it is a manageable problem.'","New York Democratic Rep.

"A daredevil delivering an American football to one of Europe's biggest stadiums missed the giant arena and landed on a railway track instead. The bungling parachutist was planning to land on the turf of the 82,000 capacity Croke Park stadium in Dublin, but instead got blown off course and was forced to come down on a train line. Luckily for the jumper, no train was passing at the time he landed. The University of Central Florida parachutist approaches Croke Park from the Dublin docklands . As he approaches, left, it is soon clear that he is in desperate trouble and won't be able to clear Hill 16, right . The college football match between Penn State and the University of Central Florida attracted more than 20,000 American visitors to Dublin. Before the game, two F16 jets flew passed the stadium at around 800ft causing a number of car alarms to go off in the Drumcondra area of Dublin. Following the flypast, a pair of parachutists, one representing each team was due to drop into the stadium having jumped out of another aircraft over the Dublin docklands. While the Penn State jumper managed to land in the centre of the pitch safely, the UCF parachutist got blown off course. The parachutist struggled to line up with the Hill 16 side of the stadium which has a low terrace and instead was forced to land on a railway track adjacent to the ground. The Penn State parachutist had no problems finding the 82,000 capacity stadium in Dublin . Irish Rail confirmed that their 'unexpected visitor' did not cause any delays to passengers . On the pitch, the news was equally bad for UCF after they were beaten by a late field goal, 26-24 in front of 55,000 fans. American football fans in the Irish capital were treated to a thrilling contest as two college teams made their way across the Atlantic to play their season opening game. And it was Penn State who prevailed thanks to the 36-yard field goal from Sam Ficken as time expired. Behind second-half replacement quarterback Justin Holman, the Knights appeared to have scored their own unlikely comeback victory when Holman scored on a 6-yard touchdown run to put UCF up 24-23 with 1:13 left. Christian Hackenberg, in white, managed to carry the ball 454 yards during the opening game of the season . But Christian Hackenberg - capping a 32-for-47, 454-yard performance - coolly directed a seven-play drive to set up Ficken's fourth successful field goal as the Penn State bench swarmed the field. Saturday's winners received the Dan Rooney Trophy, a specially commissioned football made of ancient Irish bog wood, as cannons blasted blue-and-white streamers and confetti into the air at Croke Park. Hackenberg spoiled a stunning performance by Holman, who came on for the second drive of the second half after coach George O'Leary benched the ineffective Pete DiNovo. The redshirt freshman was 3 of 8 for 18 yards. Penn State ended the first half up 10-3, but should have been ahead by more as UCF struggled to move the ball at all. Both teams looked let-lagged in what was the first overseas game in either school's history. University of Central Florida fans enjoyed their trip to Dublin despite the parachute mishap and losing the game . The Nittany Lions' opening drive was extended by a roughing-the-kicker penalty, then Hackenberg dropped a 44-yard bomb between two defenders to receiver DaeSean Hamilton. Zach Zwinak finally punched the ball in from the 1-yard line on his third attempt to put Penn State up 7-0. A 68-yard kick-off return by Jordan Akins gave UCF the ball on Penn State's 23, but O'Leary gambled and lost with a 4th down decision to go for it on PSU's 1-yard line. DiNovo's rollout straight into a pass rush was doomed from the start and he threw the ball away. UCF cornerback Jacoby Glenn made a diving interception on Hackenberg's next possession, but the Knights could manage only a 36-yard Shawn Moffitt field goal to make the score 10-3. The game tempo accelerated as soon as Holman entered the game. He ran for two touchdowns and threw for a third, a 10-yard bullet to Josh Reese with 11:31 left that narrowed Penn State's lead to 20-17.","Two parachutists aimed to land at Croke Park in Dublin yesterday afternoon .

"A man who was cycling from Maryland to Miami to propose to his girlfriend has been stabbed to death by a homeless man after stopping for a snack at a McDonald's. Police officers found an engagement ring in Kevin Adorno's pocket when they rushed to the fast-food restaurant in Vero Beach, Florida, on Monday evening. Adorno had been on the phone to his girlfriend when he was attacked without warning by Rene Herrera Cruz, who told police that he thought Adorno was plotting to kill him, authorities said. Adorno's girlfriend told police that she heard his phone drop before a wail of sirens, FoxCT reported. Tragedy: Kevin Adorno (left) was killed by a homeless man after he stopped at a McDonald's to get a snack as he biked down the east coast. Once in Miami, he was going to propose to his girlfriend Elyse (right) Adorno, from Farmington in Connecticut, had left home in mid-August to complete his dream of cycling down the east coast. Last year, he and his sister had cycled from Maine to Maryland, and this year, he planned to finish the rest of the journey. He had shared dozens of photographs along his route, including images of his bike propped up on sandy beaches and in city centers. His girlfriend, Elyse, had planned to fly down and meet him 20 miles from his destination so that she could finish the journey with him. When they reached Miami, he had planned to propose to her. But on Monday evening, he stopped at the restaurant to charge his phone and get a snack, WPBF reported. A witness said he went outside to use his phone when he was attacked around 9.30pm. 'Killer': Rene Herrera Cruz, 59, told police he saw Adorno looking at him before making a phone call and thought he was instructing people to kill him. He admitted to stabbing Adorno in the chest and arm, police said . Scene: Adorno had stopped at this McDonald's in Vero Beach, Florida for a snack and to charge his phone . Police said he was repeatedly stabbed in the arm and chest and, as he began losing a lot of blood, he collapsed near a bathroom. 'Although EMS and Fire Rescue also assisted in the attempts to save Adorno, he succumbed to his wounds and was pronounced deceased a short time later at the IRMH,' police said. The 59-year-old suspect, who was arrested nearby on Monday night, told authorities that he had attacked Adorno because he believed he was on the phone instructing people to kill him. He said he also thought Adorno was taking photos of him and that he felt threatened. Authorities found a bloodied 12-inch blade that Cruz had allegedly thrown into a bush after the attack. He had also taken off his dirty shirt and discarded it. Cruz, who was known to local police, has been charged with first-degree murder. Together: Elyse had planned to fly from Connecticut to join her boyfriend for the last 20 miles, and once they reached Florida, he was going to propose to her, family said. Police found an engagement ring in his pocket . Plans: On Facebook, he shared this map of his planned route down the east coast. Last year, he and his sister cycled from Maine to Maryland, and this summer he had hoped to finish off the journey . Excitement: Throughout his journey, he shared photographs to Facebook, showing his various stops . Journey: He shared this image of the Florida border on August 30, two days before he was killed . Vero Beach Police Chief David Currey told NBC that they had dealt with Cruz just the night before. 'He called us from Burger King right across the street and he told responding officers that individuals were looking for him or were after him,' Currey said. Adorno, who owned a graphic design business based in Hartford, Connecticut, was an outgoing, adventurous friend and brother, family said. 'Just a pure soul as charismatic as anyone could ever be, smile from ear to ear always generous,' close friend Kenneth Silva told WPFB. 'Just a really good guy.' Family members wrote on Facebook that they were 'absolutely devastated' by the loss. Adorno's family is now traveling to Florida to retrieve his body and help with the investigation.

"Large transnational companies are getting away with paying little tax in Australia by taking advantage of recent cuts at the Australian Tax Office, an outgoing ATO employee has claimed. The insider said the ATO's Internationals department, which is responsible for making sure companies such as Google, IKEA, Apple and Starbucks pay their fair share of tax, has lost a large number of senior staff in recent years, The Canberra Times reported. Funding cuts to the tax office combined with an Internationals department that is increasingly made up of junior staff has left the ATO unable to properly pursue multinational companies, he said. For the 2013-14 financial year IKEA paid just $7.7 million in tax after making a profit of $92 million . For the 2013-14 financial year IKEA paid just $7.7 million in tax after making a profit of $92 million. In 2013 Apple paid $36 million in tax despite making $6.1 billion in Australia, while Google paid just $7.1 million despite making $46.5 million. In 2013 Starbucks Australia had gone 13 years without paying any company tax. The ATO insider said the 'big four' accounting firms that represent large corporations - including PwC, KPMG, Deloitte and Ernst & Young - were bolstered by the loss of senior staff and were attempting trickier ways of tax avoidance. Large transnational companies are getting away with paying little tax in Australia by taking advantage of recent cuts at the Australian Tax Office, an outgoing ATO employee has claimed . 'That's more likely to be the case in a climate of a loss of staff, it has progressively become that way during the past three years, Internationals has dramatically shrunk in its technical staff,"" the mid-ranking executive, who did not wish to be named, said. He added that new rules within the ATO restricting audits to a 90-day time frame also made employees less likely to pursue 'hard-nosed' audits. 'The Taxation Office is saying they want say, a 90-day turnaround, the office doesn't want a team to be bogged down in a case that might take months or years, unless they know there is going to be a revenue outcome,' he told the Times. In 2013 Starbucks Australia had gone 13 years without paying any company tax . An ATO spokesman denied there was a 90 day time limit. 'This seems to have selectively chosen from blue-sky discussions about things that could occur in the longer term,' he said. 'The Commissioner ensures that reviews of multinational operations are thoroughly carried out according to case plans. Reviews and audits usually take a couple of years to complete.' The spokesman said staff numbers in the Internationals branch had remained steady since 2011 . 'International structuring and profit shifting issues can be complex and that is why the ATO recruited further expertise into its International area, and into its advice and review teams.  The International area will continue to restructure as the risk environment changes,' he said. 'Multinational groups are reviewed by teams of compliance officers located in our Public Groups area.  Those teams include a range of officers of different seniority and experience levels who work together to make sure the right skills are brought to bear on each case.'

"More than half of British pilots have fallen asleep in the cockpit of a passenger plane. And alarming research has revealed that one in six commercial pilots has woken up at the controls - only to see that their co-pilot is dozing too. The findings were revealed yesterday, following reports that two pilots fell asleep on a British passenger plane last month. In the air: The captain and co-pilot of the Virgin Atlantic Airbus A330 . blamed their long shifts for falling asleep but the CAA accepts the pair were not asleep at the same time . The captain and co-pilot of the Virgin Atlantic Airbus A330 blamed their long shifts. Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Atlantic . admitted its plane was involved, but denied reports that both pilots . were asleep at the same time. A . spokesman said the captain and co-pilot were sleeping in alternate . 20-minute intervals – an approved practice known as ‘in-flight napping’. A Civil Aviation Authority report stated ‘pilots asleep’ but the company says the issue was about fatigue. The incident was logged after one . of the pilots reported it. However today the CAA said in a statement: 'Following clarification from the airline concerned, the CAA is satisfied that while this was a reportable event, and both pilots were concerned they were suffering symptoms of severe fatigue and took controlled rest separately, they did not fall asleep at the same time. 'It was right that the airline reported this to us after one of the pilots raised their concerns. The airline is now taking steps to adjust its rostering arrangements for flight crew.' The CAA described it as an isolated incident, and experts said passengers’ lives were not at risk because the plane would have been on auto-pilot. Airlines involved in safety alerts are not normally identified – so as not to discourage them from reporting future incidents and risking negative publicity. The Civil Aviation Authority does not name the airlines involved in its Mandatory Occurrence Reporting (MOR) scheme as it relies on the honesty of firms and their crews to highlight concerns. Airlines are legally obliged to report any potential safety breaches to the CAA while individual crew members can also report incidents. But critics argue that passengers have the right to know which airlines are involved as it could influence their decisions about booking flights. A CAA spokesman said: ‘We don’t identify airlines because that would potentially impact on future reporting. ‘We have MOR so that people can feel comfortable reporting concerns, and so any risks can be mitigated. The idea is that the industry can learn from these reports, not so that someone  can apportion blame.’ A CAA report said the crew were ‘suffering from symptoms of severe fatigue’. It . added: ‘Both members of flight crew had only five hours sleep in two . nights due to longer duty period with insufficient opportunity to sleep. Both crew rested for 20-minute rotations and fell asleep.’ The CAA has recorded two previous . incidents of pilots falling asleep in the cockpit. However, the British . Airline Pilots Association (Balpa) said the industry regulator only . recorded episodes that were reported – and warned that pilots fell . asleep with alarming regularity. The union, which represents three-quarters of pilots in the UK, said demanding flight schedules and busy airline rotas were to blame. Research by Balpa found that half of all pilots said tiredness was ‘the biggest threat to flight safety’. Some 56 per cent said they had fallen asleep in the cockpit. Of those, 29 per cent – about one in six of all pilots – said they woke up to find their co-pilot was also asleep. The research was carried out ahead of a European Parliament vote on EU rules for flying hours, which takes place on Monday. Balpa . warns the new regulations will put lives at risk as they will legalise . shift patterns that could see pilots kept awake for up to 24 hours. Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic admitted its plane was involved, but denied reports that both pilots were asleep at the same time. Sir Richard is pictured last week at London's Royal Albert Hall . In its poll of 500 pilots, 84 per cent . said their flying abilities had been compromised during the past six . months. Some 43 per cent experienced problems once a month. Only half said their airline would back them if they refused to fly because of fatigue. Balpa . general secretary Jim McAuslan said: ‘British pilots want to make every . flight a safe flight and tiredness is the biggest challenge they face.’ Transport ministers were warned of the dangers of sleepy pilots nine months ago, but said it was not ‘a reported flight safety issue’. A CAA spokesman stressed that, if approved, new European rules ‘will increase our oversight role of airline operators and place firm obligations on airlines to introduce comprehensive fatigue-management policies and monitoring systems’. A spokesman for the Department for Transport added: ‘The Civil Aviation Authority is satisfied that the proposed requirements will improve safety across the EU as a whole. ‘Flight Time Limitation requirements are there to ensure that pilots and other crew members do not operate aircraft with unsafe levels of fatigue.’ They claimed the proposals ‘go further than current requirements, by obliging airlines to plan rotas and manage crew duties to actively address the risk of fatigue’.","More than half of UK pilots have fallen asleep in passenger plane cockpit .

"The next generation iPad will look something like a giant iPad mini, if these apparently leaked images are to be believed. The pictures purport to show the back-plate of of Apple's fifth-generation tablet which, according to recent reports, should be available for iFans this autumn. It comes as the Silicon Valley gadget maker officially announced the UK launch of a new addition to their current iPad range: a new premium 128GB model that offers double the storage of their previous top of the line tablet. Unverified: This picture, first published by Apple fan site 9to5Mac.com, purports to show the backplate of the fifth-generation iPad, with an iPad Mini backplate shown on the right for comparison . The so-far unverified pictures of the iPad 5 backplate were published yesterday by Apple fan site 9to5Mac, which received them from 'a purported China-based iPad accessories maker'. It is the second Apple leak in as many . days after speaker block components apparently from the forthcoming . iPhone 5S and iPhone 6 were pictured by French tech blog Nowhereelse.fr. The source of the latest leak told . 9to5Mac their pictures show a prototype back piece for a . fifth-generation iPad with a 9.7in display, and that the casing is . almost as thin as the same component on the iPad mini. A black antenna cut to the top of the plate suggests its for a model which includes 4G connectivity. The next iPad had been expected to . launch this spring, but recent indications are that it will not hit the . shops until October. That delay in its release could explain why casings . are currently floating around in China. Forthcoming: The source of the leak said the pictures show a prototype back piece for a fifth-generation iPad with a 9.7in display, and that the casing is almost as thin as the same component on the iPad mini . In the meantime, Apple today announced . that a new 128GB model of its current-generation iPad will be available . in the UK and U.S. from next week - just in time to take on the pro . version of Microsoft's Surface tablet. It will join the 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB . fourth-generation iPads which Apple already has on the market and comes . after Microsoft last week announced it was to market a pro version of . its Surface tablet in North America from next week. Apple will release a 128GB version of the iPad next  week, just in time to take on the latest top-of-the-line pro version of Microsoft's Surface tablet. The forthcoming fourth-generation Apple tablet with a Retina display will not be a redesign of current models but rather an addition to the current line. It will join the 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB fourth-generation iPads which Apple already has on the market. It will cost £639 for the WiFi model and £739 for the mobile internet-enabled version when it goes on sale through Apple shops and authorised resellers on February 5. It comes after Microsoft last week announced it was to market a pro version of its surface tablet in North America from next week. Powered by an Intel x86-type processor, the Microsoft Surface Pro will run a full version of the latest Windows 8 OS, allowing it to use fully featured Windows software rather than the slimmed-down apps currently available for Windows RT. That has allowed Microsoft to position the gadget as a complete laptop replacement. It comes in both 64GB and 128GB versions but, unlike Apple's tablets, does not have a SIM slot to enable connection to mobile networks. Apple has pitched the new premium . model of the iPad squarely at the corporate market, pointing out in a . release that 85 per cent of the world's top 500 companies are currently . deploying or testing the machine. 'Companies regularly utilising large . amounts of data such as 3D CAD files, X-rays, film edits, music tracks, . project blueprints, training videos and service manuals all benefit from . having a greater choice of storage options for iPad,' a spokesman said. 'The over 10 million iWork users, and . customers who rely on other incredible apps like Global Apptitude for . analysing team film and creating digital playbooks, Auria for an . incredible 48 track recording system, or AutoCAD for drafting . architectural and engineering drawings, also benefit greatly from having . the choice of an iPad with more storage capacity.' Like its more modest peers in the iPad . range, the 128GB iPad 4 comes equipped with a .7-inch Retina display, . Apple-designed A6X chip, FaceTime HD camera, iOS 6.1, WiFi and optional . 4G mobile internet. It will cost £639 for the WiFi model . and £739 for the mobile internet-enabled version when it goes on sale . through Apple shops and authorised resellers on February 5. The appearance of the iPad backplate . pictures is the second purported leak in as many days of components . expected to be used in forthcoming Apple products.

"When 11-year-old Wren Kauffman goes back to school this week it will be the first time many of his classmates will have seen him as a boy. The Canadian child was born a girl but, thanks to the support of his family, Wren is ready to start life as the gender he believes he should have been born as. Teachers and fellow pupils are aware of Wren's transformation and when he starts at his Edmonton school he will use the boy's locker rooms and toilets. New beginning: Wren, right, with his mother Wendy and sister Avy look at pictures of him growing up as a girl . Although Wren, who was born Wrenna, knew from a young age that he was different, it took his parents a little longer to realize their daughter wanted more than to just be a tom boy. 'It's like you're trapped inside someone else's body that you don't want to be in,' Wren told CTV News. From a very early age Wren enjoyed dressing up as comic book heroes, wore his hair short and, at about the age of 3, would ask when he would get to be a boy. It was his little sister, Avy, who finally pressed home to their parents that Wren was transgendered. Back to school: When Wren returns after the summer holidays his teachers and classmates will treat him as a boy . Trapped: From a young age, 11-year-old Wren knew he was different . Supportive: The Kauffmans have accepted Wren's decision and say they love him unconditionally . 'She said to me, ""You know, Mom, Wren is a boy and he told me to tell you,' Wendy Kauffman told 680 News. She . said that when she told Avy, Wren just wants to be a boy, her . six-year-old daughter said: 'No, Mom, he really wants to a boy,' Mrs Kauffman said her young child had been able to see what Wren was going through, before his parents had. When he was nine, Mrs Kauffman said Wren got really upset, and told her: 'I know that I'm different, I feel different every day. I can't be a girl and be happy.' Mrs Kauffman added: 'When I think about it, it makes me sad that I didn't listen sooner.' Relaxed: Since starting to live like a boy Wren has been happier . Prepared: Wren says he is aware he may be bullied later on but says he can handle it . She later told Wren: 'I love you whether you’re a boy or a girl and I . understand now. And we’ll figure out how we can help you. And we’ll do . it together.' His parents got in touch with Kris Wells, from the University of Alberta's Institute for Sexual Minority Studies and Services. He . said when he first met the family, he could see they loved their . children unconditionally and were on a quest to be able to help Wren. Six out of 1,000 students experience transgenderism, according to some studies, and Dr Wells said his department receives calls and emails from parents and schools asking for help at least once a day. In Wren's case, he is being given injections to delay puberty until he is 16, so he can decide whether to being male hormone treatment and, ultimately, gender realignment surgery when he is 18. True identity: After 11 years trapped in a girl's body, Wren is slowly making the changes to become male . While some families chose to be secretive, the Kauffman's have been open about Wren's transformation. He said some people have teased him but he 'can handle it,' although he is prepared that he may be bullied later in life. 'If you’re not yourself, then it kind of gets sad and depressing,' Wren said. 'I’m glad that I told everybody.'","Family reveal daughter Wrenna's transformation to become their son, Wren .

"Jose Mourinho's work in the summer transfer market has been lauded as a masterstroke - with Chelsea making a profit while bringing in the likes of Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas. But the Chelsea boss says future summers will be more like this one - with the Blues no longer willing to splash out hundreds of millions on star players as they were in the early years of Roman Abramovich's reign. Mourinho reckons Financial Fair Play will spell the end for Chelsea's days as big spenders - and says they will never match the £60million fee Manchester United have paid for Angel Di Maria, breaking Chelsea's transfer record of £50m for Fernando Torres in January 2011.

In every transfer window Chelsea is losing players, is selling players,' Mourinho told Eurosport. Chelsea's commercial revenue is far behind that of Manchester United - who have spent big on the likes of Di Maria and Luke Shaw during the summer - with the Blues bringing in just £30m a season from a kit deal with Adidas compared to United's new £75m-a-year sponsorship. But Mourinho has no problems with cutting his spending after previously working on a shoe-string budget at Porto. 'Chelsea in this moment is not a spender – Chelsea in this moment is making more money in transfers than the money we spend. 'So Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern, Manchester (United) – all these huge teams, I think they have an advantage.'

"Watching television shows filled with action and sound may be bad for your waistline. Researchers have found that TV viewers ate more while watching action flicks than when watching an interview. They warned those worried about their weight to avoid or limiting high-calorie snacks when watching TV. Step away from the snacks: Researchers found people watching 'The Island,' (pictured) a 2005 sci-fi thriller starring Scarlett Johansson and Ewan McGregor ate more than those watching the 'Charlie Rose' show, a public television interview program. Cornell University researchers randomly assigned almost 100 undergraduates to watch one of three 20-minute sessions with exceprts from one of the following: . 'The Island,' a 2005 sci-fi thriller starring Scarlett Johansson and Ewan McGregor; that same movie but without the sound; or the 'Charlie Rose' show, a public television interview program. The students were all provided generous amounts of cookies, M&M candies, carrots and grapes. A Cornell study found viewers ate more M&Ms, cookies, carrots and grapes while watching an excerpt from a Hollywood action film than those watching an interview program. 'More distracting TV content appears to increase food consumption: action and sound variation are bad for one's diet,' lead researcher Aner Tal said. 'The more distracting a TV show, the less attention people appear to pay to eating, and the more they eat.' Charlie Rosecould help you lose weight, the researchers say. The authors examined how objective technical characteristics, such as the frequency of visual camera cuts or variations in sound, might influence how much food is eaten.

During 'The Island,' students ate on average about 7 ounces (207 grams) of various snack foods, and 354 calories. That was almost 140 calories more and nearly double the ounces they ate watching interviewer Charlie Rose. Watching the movie without sound, they also ate more - almost 100 calories more - compared with Charlie Rose. The faster paced TV seemed to distract viewers more, contributing to mindlessness eating, said Cornell researcher Aner Tal, the study's lead author.","Researchers studied eating habits during viewings of 'The Island,' a 2005 sci-fi thriller starring Scarlett Johansson and Ewan McGregor .

"California may already be in the midst of one of its worst droughts in decades, but now scientists have warned that the southwest is at risk of water shortages which could last up to 30 years. Climate scientists have claimed that the chances of experiencing a decade-long drought in the region have now reached 50 per cent, while the chances of a 'megadrought' lasting more than 30 years is now between 20 and 50 per cent. Researchers from Cornell University, the University of Arizona and U.S. Geological Survey say their predictions should be viewed as 'conservative' as not enough is being done to curb emissions that lead to climate change. Toby Ault, a professor at Cornell, said any of these long droughts would 'be worse than anything seen during the last 2,000 years and would pose unprecedented challenges to water resources in the region'. Roughly 58 per cent of California is now facing 'exceptional' drought conditions, the most severe category of drought, as rivers dry up and farmers warn of crop failures across the state. California is currently in the grips of one of the most severe droughts in the last decade as climate scientists warn the problem could get even worse .

"During the dark days of the First World War, 2nd Lieutenant JRR Tolkien kept his revolver close to him at all times as he fought to survive the front-line trenches. Now the precious gun is going on display for the first time, helping Lord of the Rings fans connect with the history that helped shape the author's writing. The Webley MK VI was given to Tolkien who joined the 11th Battalion of the Lancashire Fusiliers in June 1916. JRR Tolkien's revolver was given to him as he endured life in the front line trenches of the Somme in 1916 . Claire Wilson, exhibitions manager, at the Imperial War Museum examines the weapon, which was the standard British revolved at the outbreak of World War I . He was an Oxford University in 1914, but only two years later was serving as a battalion signals officer during the Battle of the Somme, one of the bloodiest conflicts in history. Best . known for his classic titles The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings . trilogy, Tolkien served in the Great War through the summer and autumn . of 1916 before contracting trench fever due to weeks of tension being . weighed down in wretched conditions. He was sent back to hospital in Birmingham, West Midlands, where he remained unfit for the rest of the war, and so began to write early versions of his 'Middle Earth' stories. Debate still continues regarding the extent to which Tolkien's war experiences influenced his literary work, however the impact of the battle remained with him for the rest of his life and fans say its influence can clearly be seen in his writing. His gun, which was an updated version of the Webley Mk V - the standard British service revolver at the outbreak of World War I - will go on display in the Imperial War Museum North's Main Exhibition Space in Manchester this month. The museum is holding an exhibition next year to mark the centenary of the war, called 'From Street To Trench: A War That Shaped A Region'. Tolkien is best known for his books, The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings trilogy . Graham Boxer, director of IWM North, said: 'This December, just as the latest The Hobbit film launches in cinemas, visitors to IWM North will be able to see this weapon and connect further with Tolkien's magical stories which were born from harrowing wartime experiences. 'Exhibiting this object is for us the start of what will be an extremely busy time as we prepare to launch our major First World War Centenary exhibition.' Tolkien graduated from the University of Oxford in June 1915 and soon obtained a commission in the army as a Second Lieutenant. In June 1916 Tolkien went to France and was posted to the 11th Battalion, The Lancashire Fusiliers. Between June and November 1916, more than one million people were killed in the Battle of The Somme. Tolkien and his battalion were posted there from 1916 and he occupied front line trenches in Beaumont-Hamel, Serre and the Leipzig Salient. The Imperial War Museum tells the story of people who have lived, fought and died in conflicts involving Britain and the Commonwealth since the First World War. The 'One Ring' has been likened to the atomic bomb . Although the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit author has denied his story was an allegory for World War I or II, he did admit that no author can ‘remain wholly unaffected by his experience’. This denial has not stopped fans of the novels from speculating, and noting the parallels between the books and the wars Tolkien lived through. Characters Sauron and Saruman have been compared with Hitler and Stalin, while the marshes of Mordor have been likened to World War I’s Western Front. The ‘One Ring’, meanwhile, has been speculated to symbolise the atomic bomb. While John Garth, the author of Tolkien and the Great War, said that Tolkien denied the comparisons, he strongly believes Tolkien was inspired by his experiences in World War I. 'People think about the Second World War but it was that First World War that shaped a lot of his writing,' he said. Mr Garth said that the main character in Lords of the Rings, Frodo Baggins, can rightfully be compared with a young war officer and his journey with the 'traumatising experiences of war'. On Frodo's main companion to Mordor, meanwhile, Mr Garth said: 'Tolkien specifically said that Samwise Gamgee was a kind of tribute to the servants that he had known in World War One.'","Webley MK V was standard British service revolver at the outbreak of war .

"During an impromptu Twitter Q&A a few days ago, Petr Cech began reminiscing about his first Chelsea game way back in 2004. ‘I cannot forget my first game against United and everyone was shouting “Carlo, Carlo” (Cudicini) and was not happy I play.’ That game, against Manchester United on August 15, was Cech’s debut and he kept a clean sheet, as he has done 158 times in the Barclays Premier League since his arrival from Rennes a decade ago. VIDEO Scroll down to watch The many talents of Petr Cech . Sign of the times: Petr Cech walks towards the bench to take his place against Burnley . No substitute for class: Cech 9right) sits next to his old mucker Didier Drogba at Turf Moor . Grabbing his chance: Thibaut Courtois got the nod ahead of Cech against Burnley and is now Chelsea's No 1 . Incidentally, Cech is a man of such integrity that he even pointed out during the Q&A that the often-quoted figure of 161 clean sheets is inaccurate because he doesn’t count the three games when he has been substituted with an injury. That gives an insight into his nature and his drive. It is no surprise he was behind the best defence in the Premier League last season. They conceded just 27 goals. Manuel Neuer, widely regarded as the best keeper in the world, conceded 23 as Bayern Munich romped to the Bundesliga title. In Spain, where Thibaut Courtois kept goal for Atletico Madrid in their title-winning season, the Belgian conceded only 26. Courtois cannot be ignored after the decision was taken to finally bring the 22-year-old keeper back to Cobham. Now he has returned to Chelsea after three years on loan at the Vicente Calderon, Cech’s prospects look bleak. The reality is that Courtois, with a La Liga title and Champions League final among his career highlights already, is Jose Mourinho’s preferred choice. A new Chelsea team is emerging, with Courtois, Filipe Luis (who was on the bench at Turf Moor on Monday evening), Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa munching goals up front. At 32, with three Premier League titles, the Champions League in 2012 and Europa League in 2013, much will depend on whether Cech has the stomach for the fight. Mourinho has indicated, on a number of occasions, that he wants the Czech keeper to remain at Stamford Bridge. ‘We have two of the best keepers in the world,’ he remarked after Monday’s 3-1 victory at Turf Moor. The new boy: Cech on his Chelsea debut against Manchester United in August 2004 . Spectacular: The Czech keeper cemented his reputation in his early years at Chelsea with superb saves . Stretching the point: Cech tips away a shot from Liverpool's Milan Baros in 2005 . Super saver: The best keepers, such as Cech, throw themselves around to keep the ball out . Foiling the best: The Chelsea keeper flies through the air to keep out Xavi and Barcelona in the Nou Camp . Taking no prisoners: Cech clatters into team-mate Didier Drogba as he clears the ball against Birmingham . VIDEO Cech future unclear . Joined in June 2004 from Rennes for £7m . 479 appearances for the club . Major honours . 3 Premier League titles (2004–05, 2005–06, 2009–10) 4 FA Cups (2006–07, 2008–09, 2009–10, 2011–12) 2 League Cups (2004–05, 2006–07) Champions League (2011–12) Europa League (2012–13) FA Community Shield (2): 2005, 2009 . Individual honours . 3 Premier League Golden Gloves (2004–05, 2009–10, 2013-14) 2 PFA Team of the Year (2004–05, 2013–14) He is right, of course, but Cech’s next game in the first team is likely to be in the third round of the Capital One Cup on September 23 or 24. He is a hugely popular member of the first-team squad at Chelsea and he has a special relationship with goalkeeper coach Christophe Lollichom. The pair are often spotted out in Knightsbridge together, heading for the upscale eateries on Brompton Road or Beauchamp Place. Lollichom, however, will have to adapt to the new set-up now that Courtois has been given the chance to be Chelsea’s first choice keeper. The Belgian is the priority now. Last weekend QPR manager Harry Redknapp spoke of a new trend emerging, with the top teams staffing their squads with two high-end keepers. Manchester City brought in Willy Caballero to compete with Joe Hart over the summer; Arsenal signed Colombia keeper David Ospina from Nice to fight it out with Wojciech Szczesny; Pepe Reina has signed for Bayern Munich, but will rarely get a game; Costa Rica keeper Keylor Navas joined Real Madrid and will vie with captain Iker Casillas for a spot. The highs: Cech (front centre) shows his elation at winning the Premiership in 2005 with Chelsea . Cup of joy: Cech celebrates beating Everton in the 2009 FA Cup final . Spot on: Cech saves Bastain Schweinsteiger's penalty on the way to Champions League glory . Kings of Europe: The keeper lifts 'Old Big Ears' on that night in Munich in 2012 . Not second rate: The Czech No 1 shows his joy at winning the Europa League last year . The problem is that no top keeper is ever satisfied with life on the substitutes bench. Julio Cesar won five Serie A titles with Inter and the Champions League under Mourinho in 2010, but wasn’t willing to play second fiddle to Rob Green. Burning £70,000 a week in wages, he spent some time in MLS with Toronto last season and joined Benfica on a two-year deal on Tuesday. Leaving Chelsea is an option for Cech and Mourinho will not stand in his way if he decides to go. Chelsea’s manager hinted at some ‘offers’ after their victory at Burnley, but Cech is reluctant to accept that his days at the Bridge are over. Sickening blow: Cech is caught by Stephen Hunt in 2006, leading to him being taken to hospital (below) Beaten to the punch: Jonathan Woodgate (centre) beats Cech to win the 2008 League Cup for Tottenham . He is a dedicated professional, a man who never drinks alcohol and always respects the club’s code of conduct. His time-keeping is immaculate. Like every keeper he has made mistakes throughout his career, but he remains one of the best in the business. That’s why, on Sunday, when he travelled with the squad to Lancashire he look frustrated and fed up. He knew his fate by then. If he decides to leave, he will be remembered as a Chelsea great. What now? Cech is facing a future as Chelsea's Capital One Cup keeper... unless he leaves .","Cech was on the bench as Courtois started against Burnley .

"An Australian man whose young twin children were conceived through a surrogate mother in Thailand has been charged with 10 counts of sexually abusing his children. The man, aged in his 50s, has also been charged with the possession of 53 child pornography images. He was revealed to have been separated from his wife, who became the children's sole carer despite having no biological connection to them, when the sexual abuse occurred. Scroll down for video . An Australian man in his 50's (left) has been charged with sexually abusing his children who were born via surrogate mother, Siriwan Nitichad (right), in Thailand . The children were born via a surrogate mother named Siriwan Nitichad and known as Aon from the Petchabun province, who claims she was paid $5,500 for her role in the birth . Police told Channel Nine's A Current Affair that the man 'seemed not to cope with fatherhood' once he'd returned to Australia after his children's birth. Court documents describe the man as having a vicious temper according to the ABC, and becoming unemployed before the marriage came to an end. However his ex-wife was forced to ask the man to take care of their children, who were aged either four or five at the time, while she was in hospital. During this time, he allegedly encouraged one of his children to touch him inappropriately as the other looked on. The children were offered stickers and lollies and threatened that if they did not follow his commands, they would be hit. Aon was 23-years-old at the time and provided her own egg before carrying the twins, as the man and his former wife struggled to conceive on their own and did not qualify for adoption. Mrs Nitichad was made aware of the allegations against the biological father in June 2013 and told the ABC 'I felt terrible, I felt very bad, I don't know how to describe it' They were born via a surrogate mother named Siriwan Nitichad and known as Aon from the Petchabun province, who claims she was paid $5,500 for her role in the birth, according to the ABC. Aon was 23-years-old at the time and provided her own egg before carrying the twins, as the man and his former wife struggled to conceive on their own and did not qualify for adoption. She told the ABC that when the couple had come to Thailand to meet her, they begged her to be their surrogate. 'She said her husband wanted to have a baby so much, please help them, please help them,' Aon said of the man's wife. As the twin's biological mother, Mrs Nitichad said she and her husband  would be happy to take them back into their care . The man, who has denied all of the allegations, is out on bail but will face court in December . The now 30-year-old woman described the twins as 'lovely' and admitted that she 'didn't want to let them go' after giving birth, claiming she would have given the couple their money back and kept the children herself if they had allowed it. She was made aware of the allegations against the biological father in June 2013 and told the ABC 'I felt terrible, I felt very bad, I don't know how to describe it'. Although Australian child welfare authorities are looking into the option of securing the children long-term care with their biological mother in Thailand, the situation has been recognised as complicated due to the children having no knowledge of their Thai background. Aon and her husband told the ABC that they would be happy to take the twins into their care. The man, who has denied all of the allegations, is out on bail but will face court in December. Surrogacy arrangements in Thailand have come under scrutiny recently because of the case of baby Gammy, a surrogate-born boy with Down syndrome whose Australian parents left him behind. The Thai government is considering new legislation to ban the practice. Thailand and Australia are working out a transition process for an expected 150 Australian couples and Thai surrogate mothers expected to give birth over the next year.

"Leicester boss Nigel Pearson has completed the signing of former Inter Milan midfielder Esteban Cambiasso. The 34-year-old arrives at King Power Stadium on a free transfer after spending 10 years at the San Siro. It is not known if the ex-Argentina international will be available this weekend when Leicester host Arsenal in the Barclays Premier League on Sunday.

But the Foxes announced in a statement on Thursday evening: 'Leicester City Football Club is delighted to announce the signing of Esteban Cambiasso on a one-year deal.' Cambiasso had been heavily linked with a move to the Barclays Premier League newcomers and his signing will add much needed experience to their midfield. He made 52 appearances for Argentina, scoring five times, before retiring from international duty in 2011, although it is with Inter where he excelled. Done deal: Cambiasso had been locked in talks with Leicester after leaving Inter Milan over the summer . He was integral to the treble-winning side of 2010, where Inter lifted the Serie A, Coppa Italia and Champions League, while he made over 300 appearances for the side after moving to Italy from Real Madrid in 2004. However, he was deemed surplus to requirements at Inter over the summer, despite making 32 Serie A appearances last season, joining fellow veterans Javier Zanetti, Walter Samuel and Diego Milito out the door. Premier League bound: The move sees Cambiasso make his mark in England for the first time in his career . Cambiasso had been linked with a move back to his homeland with River Plate, while Leicester's Premier League rivals Tottenham were also rumoured to be interested. But he will now ply his trade at the King Power Stadium, where he will wear the number 19 shirt. It is not yet known whether he will be eligible to make his debut against Arsenal on Sunday.

"From staying slender despite a diet of red wine and baguettes to having perfectly-behaved children, the fascination with French women and their seemingly idyllic lives shows no sign of abating. More than staying slim, however, it's their chic sense of style and elegant insouciance that has the rest of the world gnashing its teeth in envy. But gnash no longer for a group of achingly chic Parisiennes have unveiled a new book that explains exactly how style a' la Français is done. Glamorous: Authors (from left) Audrey Diwan, Caroline de Maigret, Sophie Mas and Anne Berest . How To Be Parisian Wherever You Are is published by Ebury and costs £16.99 . Key lessons include getting rid of those tired old UGG boots, relying on navy and finding a killer signature piece to wear every day. What's more, this is no ordinary group of French friends. Caroline de Maigret is a former model and ambassador for Chanel, while Anne Berest is the author of two novels and a biography of Bonjour Tristesse writer, Françoise Sagan. Completing the team are Audrey Diwan, a scriptwriter and editor-at-large of Stylist magazine, and film producer Sophie Mas. Here, in an exclusive extract, they reveal the new rules of being Parisian - and insist that no matter what your style, nothing is as cool as cleverness. WHAT YOU WON'T FIND IN HER CLOSET . Truth be told, if the Parisienne could just wear a Burberry trench and nothing underneath, she would be in heaven. PARENTING LIKE A PARISIENNE . A Parisienne never hires a babysitter who is too pretty, always finding the less attractive one to be far more competent. She often murmurs, with feigned discomfort, that she's a bit worried that her daughter is 'rather precocious'. It's her way of saying that her child is a genius - or that she takes after her mother. She often pretends that her child is sick to get her out of dinner parties that will bore her to death. Then she feels guilty and worries that some god will actually make her baby ill to punish her for her lies. Yummy mummy: Carla Bruni might be the mother of two children but she's still as stylish as ever . She doesn't baulk at changing nappies but she never mentions the nasty details of stomach bugs or other ailments in public. Even at the paediatrician's, she is reluctant to pronounce those words out loud. She doesn't automatically breast feed her children - only if she wants to. And anyone who tells her what she should and shouldn't do with her breasts had better beware. Particularly if he's a man... She occasionally lets her children sleep in her bed, especially because all the parenting books ever written have forbidden it and she likes to stand out from the crowd... She buys time with sweets so she can finish her phone conversation with her best friend, . She quite likes some of her children's friends, but others she thinks are real idiots. And she makes no particular effort to hide her opinion - being hypocritical would just be setting a bad example. She can spend hours playing make-believe with her little ones. She'd be quite happy to live in one of their imaginary worlds forever, if only she didn't have to return to the adult life to earn a living. FASHION: THE ESSENTIALS . Jeans, anytime, anywhere, and any way. Take a Parisienne's jeans out of her closet and she feels stark naked. Men's shoes. Simply because everyone says these chic flat shoes aren't meant for women but you're a contrarian by nature. In fact, that's the very essence of your style. Parisian chic: Emmanuelle Alt of French Vogue adores jeans and oversized shirts - even on the front row . The bag. It's not an accessory, it's your home. It's an indispensable shambles where you're just as likely to find a shrivelled up four-leaf clover as an old electricity bill. If it's beautiful on the outside, that's just to keep up appearances. And so that no one ever wonders what's inside. The little black blazer. It smartens up a scruffy pair of jeans (the ones you wear all the time) and you wear it on days when you don't want to make it look too obvious that you don't feel like making an effort. Ballet flats. Your equivalent of slippers. You don't choose between comfort and elegance; for you, it's all or nothing. Nobody ever saw Audrey Hepburn wearing carpet slippers. A small silk scarf. It has more than one function. First, it adds a touch of colour to a dark outfit without running the risk of a fashion faux pas. Then, when it rains, you wear it over your head like Romy Schneider. And, on occasion, you can even use it to wipe your child's nose when you've run out of tissues. Chic: Marion Cotillard shows how to wear navy while Vanessa Paradis makes the most of her little black blazer . The white shirt. It's iconic and timeless. A long trench, of . course, for warmer weather. You know it doesn't keep you as warm as a . down jacket. But when you put on a down jacket, you feel like you're . voluntarily adding extra love handles. A thick scarf. Precisely because you don't own a parka. And despite pretending otherwise, sometimes you get cold. The oversized sweater that slips off your shoulder. You wear it the day after a party, as if you'd snuggled up in a quilt. It's as soft as a teddy bear, as calming as Xanax, as wide as a screen, perfect for days when you feel your hips too much. Basic oversized sunglasses. Every day, even when it's raining, because you always have a reason to wear them: too bright out, a hangover, tears running down your face, a desire to be mysterious... Mon Dieu! Former French First Lady Valerie Trierweiler knows all about cheating - and being cheated on . Glamorous: Actress Julie Gayet had an affair with President Francois Hollande of France . An oversized shirt. You always . undo one extra button so it doesn't look too serious. In general, you . borrow your boyfriend's. You'll never return it and you may even one day . wear it in somebody else's arms. Love can fade, but some fashion lasts . forever. The very simple, but very expensive T-shirt. This contradiction guides your life like Liberty Leading the People: . you're perfectly happy to give into the most common trends, as long as . you can add a mark of luxury. As a result, you spend hours searching for . the perfect T-shirt, whose finely woven and slightly transparent thread . make it feel like cashmere. THE ABC'S OF CHEATING . Rule number one: DENY, DENY, DENY. Don't feel guilty: This is about you, not against him. What's good for you is good for your relationship: Basically, you're being a thoughtful girlfriend. Your lover should not be part of your circle of friends: it's OK to cheat on your boyfriend, it's not OK to humiliate him. His honour matters just as much as your personal fulfillment. Save your lover's number under 'Private Number'. Better yet, save it under your best friend's name ('She's so needy...) There's no such thing as a secret that stays a secret. The truth always comes out. Refer back to rule number one. Protect yourself - against disease and love itself (which can also make you very sick). Never complain to your lover about your boyfriend. Who wants to fool around with a woman who's dating a loser? Keep things straight: don't treat your lover like a boyfriend. Shake it up and spread the love: cheat on your lover with your boyfriend.

"Real Madrid president Florentino Perez has defended his club's transfer policy after Cristiano Ronaldo spoke out about Angel di Maria's  £60million move to Manchester United. The European champions also got rid of former Spain midfielder Xabi Alonso to Bayern Munich for just £5m, much to the disappointment of Ronaldo, who openly criticised Perez's decisions.

'I have listened to all the comments he made and as I know him, I know that he never questioned the club. My relationship with him is perfect, there are zero discrepancies. Cristiano is the best player in the world, it's obvious, and more so this year.' Perez revealed Di Maria left Real no option but to sell him after the Argentina midfielder turned down an improved contract that would have made him the second-best paid player at the club. 'I've been here since 2000,' Perez continued. 'Since then a lot of players have come and gone and my experience tells me that the ones that leave are always the best and those that arrive are always questioned. 'My first (signing) was (Zinedine) Zidane and the last (before this summer's transfer window) was (Gareth) Bale. We made the best offer that we could to Di Maria and he didn't accept it.

I reiterate that we made him the best possible offer. 'With the exception of Cristiano, Di Maria would have been the highest paid at Real Madrid. Had we accepted his financial demands it would have created an unbalanced treatment that would have put the club's stability in danger. 'Di Maria left to Manchester for a fee that we considered fair and that is why the transfer was completed. We wish Di Maria the best professionally and personally.' Perez also spoke of Alonso's unexpected move to Bayern  on a two-year deal. 'Xabi came to us and told us that he wanted to leave,' he said. 'He thought it was the best for him and for the club.

"Sportsmail asked Tottenham fans' blog the Spurs Web to reveal the mood following the news the club might have to play at a neutral ground for a year before the new stadium is ready. Mick Faldo discusses what that means for the club. Since Spurs first announced plans in 2007/08, progress to a replacement for White Hart Lane has been made at the speed of a Vedran Corluka pirouette. Ever since its inception it has appeared that every forward step with the Northumberland Development Project  has been shortly followed by two backward ones. If all had gone to the original plan we’d already have seen the team play in the completed ground –August 2014 was the target completion date. As it is, the only sign that the D in NDP doesn’t stand for ‘Demolition’ is the new Technical College in Northumberland Park (the thoroughfare, not the green space with slides and swings). VIDEO Scroll down to watch Tottenham fans worried limbo White Hart Lane . In the original plans, the Northumberland Development Project was due to be completed by August 2014 . To those of us keen to see us give ourselves the best chance possible of matching the financial clout of the Premier League’s big spenders the announcement on Wednesday that we’re going to have to spend a season away from White Hart Lane is not as disappointing as it might first appear. This is for two reasons. Firstly, we suspected this scenario would be the case for a while now. Secondly, it’s a sign of progress. Not as much of a sign as seeing Pochettino in a hard hat laying the foundation stone of the new ground, but it’s proof there is a plan - even if that plan isn't being fully adhered to. Mauricio Pochettino could face a season where Tottenham have to play home games at a neutral ground . Tottenham will move from White Hart Lane in an effort to compete financially with the big European clubs . Rumours that the unlovable Davids in charge at West Ham had refused Spurs permission to use the freshly vacated Upton Park for a season was the first time I personally got wind that we might be looking to up sticks whilst the bulldozers moved in to N17. I wonder if we offered to try the Olympic Stadium out for size for them for a season instead? So, if it’s not east London, where is it to be? Brighton, Ipswich and Wembley have all been mentioned but Stadium MK, home of the MK Dons has been a constant. Daniel Levy could consider moves to Wembley, Portman Road, Falmer Stadium or Stadium MK . A move there would set few pulses racing but the relative ease of transport from north London and a potential 32,000 capacity would tick a couple of Levy’s big boxes. An option to play the bigger games at Wembley might be a sop to those 3-4,000 who’d get squeezed out by the capacity reduction. I wonder if we could get an agreement to play all of our evening games away from home to help avoid late night long distance travel for the home fans? Let’s step into Poch’s tango shoes for a moment. He’ll hopefully have agreed a long-term plan with Levy (nope, I’ve not been sniffing anything) which will, by the time we need to move, see us jousting with the best of Europe on a regular basis. Perhaps he’d like to host those clubs who’ve limbo-ed under the Financial Fairplay rules in front of a smaller in-your-face crowd rather than the atmosphere-free Wembley? It could all end up being to our advantage. Just a thought. You can follow the Spurs Web on Twitter here.","Tottenham Hotspur due to relocate to Northumberland Park .

"A former Apple employee named Sam Sung has raised more than $2,500 for charity by auctioning off his old business card after an initial bid of $80,200 was revealed to be fake. Mr Sung, 25, worked for three years as a specialist at the Pacific Centre Apple store in Vancouver, where customers couldn't help but notice his distinctive name on his ID badge and employee T-shirt. When he left the store, he decided to set up an eBay auction to sell off of his old personalized business cards - with the money raised going to The Children's Wish Foundation. Novelty name: Sam Sung, 25, worked for three years at an Apple store in Vancouver and auctioned off his business card for charity . As the news of his coincidental name and charity auction spread across the world, the bids shot up to a staggering $80,200. However, they were later revealed to be fake - with Mr Sung's card eventually selling for a lower sum of $2,653, with the winner also receiving his old uniform and lanyard. But even though his donation to the charity is much less than he thought, he is still pleased with the money raised. He told CNBC: 'I'm so pleased at the amount that was raised and, according to Children's Wish, anything over $2,000 is considered a major gift. So for me, that's a major win and it will go towards granting a terminally ill child's wish. 'I don't think we're supposed to keep any of that stuff [featured in the auction] but working for Apple was honestly one of the funnest jobs I've had, and I wanted to keep it as a memento.' Good cause: Mr Sung had hoped to raise up to $80,000 after receiving the bid on eBay, but it turned out to be fake . In the post on the eBay page, where people were invited to bid, Mr Sung posed next to his business card, which is framed alongside his employee T-shirt and ID badge. He wrote that he came up with the idea after one of his old business cards fell out of a book. At first the auction created quite the buzz with bids rapidly flying up to $80,100 just few hours later, although this subsequently turned out to be a fake. Hoax: The post on the eBay auction site for $80,000, which turned out to be a fake . Mr Sung says he became interested in the Children's Wish Foundation, which aids children with serious illness, after attending an inaugural gala last winter. Since then, he has volunteered on numerous projects and made it his mission to help out. 'Sam has clearly been touched by what we do and come up with a creative way to support us,' said Jennifer Peterson, the director of the charity's British Columbia branch. 'One of our recent wish children, who sadly passed away just after his travel wish, summed up his experience so profoundly by saying ""I forgot I was sick,""' explained the charity director. 'Sam has made a choice to help us give another child and their family this gift.'","Sam Sung, 25 worked as a specialist at an Apple store in Vancouver .

Culver also told the newspaper she saw 'bad injuries' when she approached the plane. The six-passenger plane crashed a few hundred yards northwest of the runway, Erie Police Cmdr. Lee Mathis told the Associated Press. Three people were declared dead at the scene, and two were taken to hospitals. Friend Chris Mygatt told the newspaper Frascona, who was a lawyer for Frascona, Joiner, Goodman and Greenstein P.C., 'was as close as our industry would ever get to a celebrity in the business.'

"Wembley has been ruled out as a temporary home for Tottenham during the reconstruction of White Hart Lane because of a limit on the number of events that can be held there each year. Spurs have confirmed they will move away from their current ground for one season when work finally begins on their 56,000-capacity stadium in north London. Although preliminary talks have been held with Wembley, the stadium are limited by Brent Council to 37 events each year because of issues including noise, policing and parking. WATCH Scroll down for 'Pochettino on his club's ownership and potential stadium move' Moving: Tottenham have revealed it's 'highly unlikely' they will move into their new stadium in 2017 . Olympic Stadium . Capacity: 60,000. Distance from White Hart Lane: 4.95 miles. Likelihood: It fits the bill, but Spurs’ rivals West Ham, who will move into the stadium in 2016, would oppose the idea. Stadium mk . Capcity: 30,500. Distance from White Hart Lane: 40.05 miles. Likelihood: The capacity isn’t much smaller than the 36,240-seat White Hart Lane, but the distance between the grounds is even greater than that travelled by Coventry fans to see their team play in Northampton last season . . . and that went down very badly. On Wednesday the FA confirmed the stadium has already held 33 events this year — including England internationals, FA Cup semi-finals and the final, play-off finals, the Capital One Cup final and various others sporting events and concerts. Spurs need a stadium that can host a minimum of 19 home games in the Barclays Premier League and would also need it for the FA Cup, Capital One Cup and the possibility of European football. The old Wembley Stadium was used as a temporary solution for Arsenal in the Champions League between 1998 and 2000 because Highbury’s capacity was severely restricted for European nights. Spurs, who are still wrangling with a local business over the final piece of land on the stadium site before work can start at White Hart Lane, have explored the possibility of a temporary home at Wembley. Controversial: Spurs will have to play away from White Hart Lane for one season . It may be hard to swallow for Tottenham and West Ham fans, but their teams won't be the first to find reasonable success with ground sharing. Fulham and QPR: The west London clubs shared Loftus Road for two season between 2002 and 2004 while Craven Cottage was being redeveloped. Crystal Palace/Charlton/Wimbledon: Crystal Palace shared Selhurst Park with Charlton between 1985 and 1991 before playing hosts to Wimbledon until their extinction in 2003 . AC Milan and Inter: Both called the San Siro home since 1947 in a move that his little impact on the success of either club and the two Milan teams have acquired almost 100 major titles between them. The stadium would be an easy sell to fans because it is a neutral venue and is located just 13 miles west of their current home. A stadium share with Arsenal would be the most logical alternative but this has been ruled out because of the animosity that exists between supporters. Stadium mk, which is nearly 50 miles from White Hart Lane, is also under consideration. Spurs officials were impressed with the 32,000-capacity stadium during a visit to MK Dons for their Capital One Cup victory over Manchester United last month. Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy has secured a compulsory purchase order on the land surrounding White Hart Lane, but the last remaining tenant has been given leave to appeal to the High Court. Archway Sheet Metal Works, which is run by the Josif family, are refusing to leave until they are given adequate compensation for the inconvenience of relocating.

The current capacity is 36,240, but the Spurs chairman is convinced they need a bigger stadium to generate more income and enable them to compete with the top clubs in Europe.

"A great-grandmother who moved into her house the day before the Second World War started is celebrating 75 years living in the three-bedroom property. Beryl Willson, 79, moved into the semi-detached house in Ipswich, Suffolk, as a four-year-old in 1939. The classic inter-wars property was built in 1935 - the year Mrs Willson was born - and had been bought by her parents Mason and Maud Garrard for just £375. Beryl Willson, 79, moved into the semi-detached house in Ipswich, Suffolk, aged four in 1939 and has lived there ever since. Over the years she has raised her two children at the property and had several extensions . The great-grandmother bought the home off her parents for just £2000 in 1961 after marrying her partner John . It has since been handed down to Mrs Willson, who bought it off her parents for £2000 when she married in 1961, and the widow is now celebrating living in the property for several decades. She said: 'I can't believe I've been here so long. 'It's been a very happy home. 'I call it a home rather than a house because it's looked after so many of us down the years.' Looking back on sharing an amazing five generations of golden memories, the sprightly mother-of-two added: 'It's been a joyous place, a musical place and people always say they feel calm when they walk through the door.' Mrs Willson moved into the property with her parents on September 2, 1939 – just 24 hours before Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain declared war on Adolf Hitler's Germany. Mrs Willson moved into the property on September 2, 1939, and has since raised her own family at the property. She has two children with husband John. Pictured: Mrs Willson as a young mother with daughter Roz . Mrs Willson bought the house from her parents when she married her childhood sweetheart John in 1961 . The couple lived happily at the property for several decades, raising their two children Roz and Nigel. They celebrated their golden wedding anniversary in October 2011 but John sadly passed away earlier this year . Her father immediately joined the RAF and served in Canada and Palestine before he returned home safe and sound at the end of the six-year conflict in 1945. 'Seeing my dad come back from the war is without doubt one of the happiest memories I've got from all my years here in this home,' she said. 'It was a real time for rejoicing that he'd come back to us. 'We just loved him so much and couldn't believe that he was home for good.' She also revealed how she was evacuated to Northampton with her mother and younger brother David at the start of the war amid fears of devastating German bombing attacks. 'As dad was being posted to Canada we decided to return to our own home after six months,' she said. 'Our house was never damaged, but we had incendiary bombs dropped in the middle of our road. 'Although it was wartime we always walked to school by ourselves. 'They made it fun down the shelters for us children. 'I can remember the big barrage balloons down Sproughton Road on the Co-op site. 'We watched as two German soldiers came down on parachutes near there and they landed on Bramford Road railway bridge. 'My mum told us not to worry and said if they'd landed in our back garden she'd give them a cup of tea.' Mrs Willson grew up in her beloved house with brother David, 76, and younger sister Veronica, 66. The keen church-goer recalled: 'It was much more innocent in those days. 'We children walked to school on our own and neighbours looked out for one another.' Mrs Willson raised her two children Roz and Nigel (pictured above as a child) at the property . Mrs Willson's children Roz and Nigel (together above as children) have since gone on to have their own children . Mother-of-two Mrs Willson (pictured with her daughter Roz) said she likes to call the three-bedroom property a home and not a house because it has looked after so many generations of her family over the last 75 years . The 79-year-old has installed several extensions, including a conservatory, at the property over the years . She married her sweetheart John Willson in 1961, when she was 26, and the newlyweds promptly bought her house from her parents. The couple went on to bring up their own children there, having a daughter Roz and son Nigel, and have added several extensions including a conservatory to the property. 'Over the years new housing estates have gone up around here and neighbours have come and gone,' she said. 'But we've been so very happy here that we've never wanted to move. 'We've had good neighbours and we found that if we are friendly to people, they are friendly to us.' She celebrated her golden wedding anniversary with John in October 2011 but he sadly passed away earlier this year. Mrs Willson added: 'All my children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren come here all the time. 'They all love coming here and I like their company. 'I'd like to think that one of them keeps the house when something happens to me - and that it stays in the family because it really is one of the family.'","Beryl Willson moved into property in Ipswich, Suffolk, aged four in 1939 .

"Eddie Hearn has revealed he is in talks with the City Ground in Nottingham to make a 2015 fight between Carl Froch and James DeGale. Hopes of a Las Vegas showdown between Froch and Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr have all but disappeared, with Hearn admitting DeGale is now the ‘strong favourite’ to be Froch’s next opponent. DeGale, who is set to have a tune-up fight in Sheffield on December 6, is the mandatory challenger for Froch’s IBF super-middleweight world title and Hearn believes it is doubtful that the Nottingham fighter will vacate his belt.

Next up: DeGale (right) earned mandatory status by beating Brandon Gonzales at Wembley in May . Therefore, it is looking increasingly likely that Froch will follow his stunning Wembley win over George Groves in May with another stadium fight, with February and March dates under consideration. Hearn, writing in his Mail Online column, said: ‘I met with Carl Froch last week and the first thing I could see is that he is getting itchy knuckles again. This guy wants to fight. ‘There are a lot of discussions going on at the moment and as it stands it looks to me like a fight with Julio Cesar Chavez is not going to happen.

Down and out: Froch retained his world titles with a knockout victory over George Groves . ‘James DeGale is now strong favourite to get the fight, probably in February or March of next year. 'James is obviously Carl’s mandatory challenger for the IBF super-middleweight belt and under those terms Carl has to fight him by the end of February or give up the belt. Carl is not the sort of fighter who just gives up a belt so I think that fight is now very likely. ‘I have had some discussions about possible venues and I am looking at a few outdoor stadia, including the City Ground in Nottingham, Carl’s hometown.

"George Foreman says he sees similarities between his famous 'Rumble in the Jungle' with Muhammad Ali and Qatar staging the 2022 World Cup. Heavyweight greats Foreman and Ali headed to Zaire 40 years ago for an amazing sporting spectacle that no-one thought could possibly be staged in the middle of Africa. There has been similar shock around the globe at Qatar bringing the World Cup to the Middle East and, at a meeting in Zurich on Monday, FIFA was advised by its medical experts for the tournament to be moved away from the Arab state's searing summer temperatures and played in winter for the first time. Muhammad Ali stands back as referee Zack Clayton calls the count over opponent George Foreman . But Foreman believes the cynicism will disappear when Qatar stages the World Cup - just like it did four decades ago when he was knocked out by Ali in the Zairean capital Kinshasa. 'Zaire had the same reputation as being out of the way but once we got there there were modern hotels and everything else,' Foreman said. 'They wanted to show the world we have more here than just the jungle and Qatar is also very smart in this regard. Ali cops a left hook to the face from Foreman during the pair's famous 'Rumble in the Jungle' bout in Zaire . 'The country has so much to offer and there's a lot of things for the tourists to see. 'They do great business and put on great events and the World Cup will highlight it like nothing else. 'The whole world is frightened of going to new places and that's why you put on big sporting events, they can't resist it. 'They must come and see it and that's why sports are so important. Ali yells 'Ako bo mai ye' before his fight which translates from Zaire's Lingalla dialect as 'I will kill him' 'There's a lot of ignorance but once you can show the world what you can do it shows you're the same as everyone else.' Last week marked the 40th anniversary of the classic contest between Ali and Foreman which still resonates today. The unusual venue and build-up to the fight marked it out as something special and the combatants duly delivered in the ring as Ali upset the odds and the fearsome Foreman with an eighth-round knock-out to become the heavyweight champion of the world for the third time at the age of 32. Last week marked the 40th anniversary of the classic contest between Ali and Foreman (above) Foreman says he is proud to be part of sporting history even though he ended up on the canvas. 'Every year I watch the fight and I keep thinking I'm going to win!' Foreman said at the DohaGOALS 2014 Forum in Qatar. 'It's too bad I lost, but I was part of sports history and every year I'm asked to talk about it. 'It comes alive again and tells me how important the event really was and how happy I am to be part of it. Foreman sees similarities between the 'Rumble in the Jungle'  and Qatar staging the 2022 World Cup . 'I wouldn't have changed anything in my life - apart from beating Ali - and we became good friends after the fight. 'When you're boxing you're so motivated and so jealous, but when you finish you realise you have so much in common. 'We were both heavyweight champions of the world, so why can't we be the best of friends? 'The last time I spoke to him on the telephone I said 'I want a re-match'. He said 'Be quiet. You're crazy!' Foreman, however, does have one regret these days - and that's boxing is not what it was any more. 'When I fought it was a special time for boxing,' Foreman said. 'I miss that excitement in the heavyweight division, it's not there, but I hope we're going to get another champion who could be another Muhammad Ali or George Foreman. 'Mike Tyson was good but it didn't last long and the Klitschko brothers have been too good for everyone else. 'I've not made a lot of Anthony Joshua yet as hasn't developed into a personality, but once he does that the sky's the limit for him.'","Heavyweight greats George Foreman and Muhammad Ali headed to Zaire 40 years ago for an amazing sporting spectacle .

"According to the children's rhyme, beans are the musical fruit - but now you can turn any food and household item into an instrument thanks to Ototo. Ototo, from London-based designers Dentaku, is a small synthesiser that lets people build instruments out of everyday, inanimate objects including pipes, cardboard boxes and other junk items. Alternatively, users can connect it to fruit, vegetables and other conductive items to turn these objects into keys that play music when touched. Scroll down for video . To turn an object into an instrument, users connect the Ototo, pictured right, from London-based Denatku, to the item using crocodile clips. A demonstration video shows the designers getting sounds from an aubergine, pictured left . Keys: 12 key capacitive touch keyboard (1 octave) with connectors . Sensors: Four sensor inputs, 5V analog input . Audio: Built-in speaker and 3.5mm headphone output . Power: Powered by 2 x AA batteries or micro USB . Memory: 128 Mbit Flash . Extras: Seven sensors including Rotation, Slider, Touch Strip, Light, Breath, Joystick and Force .

"Caroline struggled to find just eight models that were healthy enough to appear in her show . It should have been the proudest moment of my year. Yet as I watched eight models wearing my designs stride down the spotlight-studded catwalk at the Bulgari Hotel in Knightsbridge on Tuesday – the final day of London Fashion Week – I was troubled by a dark and deeply disturbing memory. Just three weeks earlier, I had held my first casting session – and almost every girl who attended was devastatingly thin and looked severely malnourished. It was the first time in my 22 years as a fashion designer that I had struggled to find just eight models who looked healthy and shapely enough to appear in my annual catwalk show. The parade of jutting spines, protruding hipbones, flat chests and wasted muscles on casting day was achingly sad. One girl was so determined to win a space on my catwalk that she layered on three pairs of tights in a desperate attempt to make her legs appear less stick-like. Many of the girls wore heavily-padded bras, some with fillets inserted, to give the semblance of shape to their flat chests – though they were quickly found out as I measure the models in their underwear to check that their actual measurements tally with what they claim. Yet even more disturbing are the legions of girls who don’t try to disguise their skeletal frames at all. Why? Because they believe that this is what the fashion world expects of them. And then came the final straw. I was utterly flabbergasted when my slim and beautiful 15-year-old daughter Annabelle turned to me and said, ‘I’m going on a diet, Mum because I want to be a model.’ What’s concerning is that Annabelle, like many girls her age, believes that the models are the essence of glamour. Caroline Castigliano thinks that Israel's decision to ban all models with a BMI under 18.5 is a move in the right direction . It worries me sick, the idea that she would get eating disorders or not eat correctly with the desire to be this size and look as stick thin as her idols. In reality, I ask modelling agencies to only send girls to castings if they meet my strict criteria: They must be a healthy-looking girl of 23 to 26 years old. She should measure 5ft9 in height but above all, she must be no smaller than a size 9. In other words, a small size 10. Usually, it takes two casting sessions to find eight suitable models who fit this criteria. Yet this year, I found only two suitable models in my first session – and none at all in my second casting session. Quite simply, they were all too thin. Panic stricken, I called a third casting session. Then a fourth, and a fifth. By Monday – just one day before the show – I was still scrambling around to find an eighth girl. Finally, a beautiful girl walked in whom I was determined to book. She had olive skin, blue eyes, she was very pretty and had a lovely toned figure with a 26-inch waist. ‘You’ve got a fabulous figure, you’re perfect. This is great,’ I told her. But her reply was shattering. She admitted, ‘I visited a modelling agency a few days ago and asked them to represent me. They told me they would only accept me if I lost five kilos.’ Caroline thinks that models such as Elle Macpherson (left) and Claudia Schiffer (right) had the right look . Caroline thinks that models today, such as Cara Delevigne (left) and Jourdan Dunn (right) do not have the same healthy figures as those in the eighties . In truth, she didn’t need to lose a pound. Had she done so, she would have looked awful. I asked what she had said to the agency and was relieved to learn that she had told them their agency wasn’t for her. But for every one of her, there are fifty models who would buckle under the pressure and instantly shed the kilos, desperate to find work in this increasingly-crowded industry. Though models have always been considered thin, there is now an unhealthy and unspoken requirement that they must be a minuscule UK size 2, 4 or 6. In other words, stick thin twiglets with no breasts, no hips, very little waistline and certainly no womanly shape. As recently as two years ago, this wasn’t the case. In my 2011 catwalk show, I hired the most fabulous-looking girl with a gorgeous size-9 shape. I didn’t bother asking her to a casting session in 2012 and booked her again without seeing her. Yet when she arrived, I was horrified. In one year, she had shrunk from shapely to emaciated. Her knees were knobbly bones and her legs were the thickness of my arms. In total, she had lost two and a half stone. Why did she do it? Because her agent advised it would allow her more work. Caroline said that womanly models, like Miranda Kerr, pictured, were rare in modern fashion . What’s ironic is that beautiful as she is, I have never employed her since. Because the clothes were dropping off her, we have to pull them to pieces and refit them. My parting warning to her was: Don’t let this industry ruin you. Cara Delevigne, Karlie Kloss, Jourdan Dunn and the it-models of today have vastly different shapes to the shapely supermodels of the Eighties, when Elle Macpherson, Christy Turlington, Claudia Schiffer graced the pages of Vogue – and when I launched my first fashion line. Named Survival Kit, it was a range of active sportswear stocked in Macy’s, Bloomingdales and Saks and never once was it difficult to cast an advertising shoot as there was an abundance of exercised, toned, healthy-looking models at that time. This was still the case in 1991 when I opened my first boutique selling couture bridal gowns and evening dresses in Esher, Surrey. Kate Moss pioneered the waif look in the 1990's . Even by 1995, as I collaborated with Jasper Conran on a line of bridal gowns, there was still no shortage of women fitting this criteria. Yet today, womanly-looking models such as Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Miranda Kerr are rarities, outnumbered by the masses of bone-thin girls. What’s changed isn’t just down to fashion or the era of  waif look, paved by Kate Moss in the mid-1990s. In fact, the entire culture of modelling has altered and with it, the model’s shapes. First, this is because models travel all the time: Whilst in the Eighties most girls working in Britain were British, today very few are. Models drop into New York for one month, to Germany for another, and many hail from Eastern Europe. Such a transient and highly-stressful lifestyle leaves little time for exercise and muscle-toning, and so thinness is instead attained by food – or lack thereof. Fashion designers also play a part: Many find it far easier to cast ‘coathanger’ models in their runway shows. Because they ‘hang’ clothes instead of wearing them, they don’t require as many time-consuming fittings and redesigns. This is perhaps why the average model who walked at London Fashion Week was barely size 2 to 4. She likely had a 22-inch waist, a size 31 bust, no hips – which is very, very small for a 5ft9 woman. Amazing measures are being taken in Israel – models with a BMI of less than 18.5 have been banned. This shouldn’t just be celebrated, it should be common sense. Anything less is dangerous, and designers should have a duty of care to encourage models – their employees – to be slim rather than skinny, fit, well-toned, with great muscles and an aura of healthiness. In short, to be woman. Which is a vastly more attractive sight than a miserable, malnourished and emaciated teenage waif.

"It took Serena Williams two months to go from the nadir of her Wimbledon embarrassment to Grand Slam champion in two months, emphatically claiming her 18th Grand Slam title on Sunday night. The 32 year-old American equalled the Major tally of Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert by overcoming an edgy Caroline Wozniacki in the US Open final 6-3 6-3 in 75 minutes, reconfirming her position as the world's number one player. After collapsing on the court in delight and trying, and failing, to surpress her emotion, she was presented by the two legends with an eighteen carat gold bracelet from Tiffany's marking the achievement. Next stop is the total of 22 Slam titles won by Steffi Graf. VIDEO Scroll down for Serena Williams: I could never imagine matching Martina Navratilova .

Passion: Williams screams in anguish despite being well in control of the match from the outset . Out of reach: Wozniacki stretches for a forehand as she falls to Williams in 75 minutes . Good spirits: Wozniacki and Williams share a laugh after the presentation in New York . In addition to the jewellry she received a cheque for $4 million (£2.41 million), comprising of her tournament winnings and a bonus for being the dominant player in the recent American events. It was the biggest single prize in tennis history. This was a far cry from her Wimbledon departure, when a 'viral illness' saw her having to default from the doubles after losing all co-ordination. She felt the key to recovery was the way she was able to re-dedicate herself after that by playing a heavy schedule leading in here: 'I think playing in all those tournaments really helped me, it gave me the calmness I needed as well,' she said. 'I practised so hard, in fact I've been practising hard for six months and that has really showed today. I was really tight and nervous, getting to eighteen has been on my shoulders for a long time. That probably weighed more than winning a sixth US Open. I never thought my name would be up with those legends, that's why I'm quite emotional.'

Leveller: Williams has caught  Martina Navratilova (left) and Chris Evert (right) on 18 Grand Slam titles . Wozniacki could not rouse herself to end this highly testing personal summer on a triumphant note, unable to match the firepower of her opponent, who successfully put their friendship to one side. That was always going to be the case as these two have been trained from so young to be ruthless on court, so no quarter was given in an ultimately disappointing contest. 'You're an unbelievable friend and you owe me drinks later,' said Wozniacki afterwards, in a nice touch of old school. In truth perhaps their relationship may have marred the quality of the encounter, rather in the way many Serena versus Venus matches have also been flat. Unless Williams suffered one of her Grand Slam implosions the 24 year-old Dane probably needed a policy of all out aggression to come off, and by the time she started to execute a more attacking game it was too late. Aside from three aces, Wozniacki's first winner on her stronger backhand side did not come until the last game of the match, and by this time the defending champion was playing much better. It has still been a fine effort from the Dane to pick herself from the trauma of her cancelled engagement, and a reward will be a return to the top 10. Close friends: Wozniacki and Williams, pals off the court, embrace after the match . Standing on ceremony: US Marines hold a giant American flag ahead of the women's singles final . Legends: Williams and Wozniacki pose for a pre-match photo with US tennis legend Billie Jean King . Serena was already the oldest ever women's US Open champion coming into this, and even just short of her 33rd birthday she had still conceded only 26 games, an indication of her how strong her form has been. In the lead-in to this tournament she had twice beaten the resurgent Wozniacki, who is yet to beat a number one player now in five attempts. Williams was attempting to ensure that this would not be the first season since 2001 that she finished up without a Grand Slam when having entered all four of them - and that duly turned out to be the case. Rory McIlroy had begun the morning by tweeting Carpe Diem (seize the day), and while he might have been referring to himself playing in Denver the romantic in you would like to believe there could have been a coded message in there. Unfortunately there was little sign of it initially as Williams saved an early break point with an ace, and then the Dane sent down two double faults to go behind an immediate break. Clearly nervous, she struggled with her first serve throughout the first set, but it was the erratic nature of her forehand that was damaging her the most and, although Serena was not at her punishing best, it was quite enough. She broke three times to win the first set, despite having her own problems and being broken twice herself. An early break put distance between them in the second, and although the overall quality of the match picked up a Williams victory was never in doubt. The younger sibling is an extraordinary athlete. The most baffling thing is that she did not get past the fourth round in any other of this season' s Majors.","Serena Williams beat Caroline Wozniacki 6-3, 6-3 in the US Open final .

"Hamburg have confirmed their interest in Tottenham midfielder Lewis Holtby but the London club have yet to receive a formal approach. The 23-year-old, who has three years remaining on his contract, is part of Mauricio Pochettino's plans and trained with the squad on Tuesday but he has plenty of interest as Premier League and foreign clubs sense a loan deal. Hamburg director Dietmar Beiersdorf told the German press: 'I’d be lying if I said we have nothing to do with Holtby.' VIDEO Scroll down to watch Lewis Holtby flatten referee Howard Webb with sliding tackle . Out the door? Hamburg are looking to sign Tottenham midfielder Lewis Holtby . Bundesliga return: But the club have yet to receive a formal request for the German . Tottenham youngster Tomislav Gomelt is in talks over a loan move to Italian side Bari. The Croatia Under 19 midfielder joined Spurs from Liga 2 side NK HASK and had spells out on loan at Royal Antwerp and Espanyol last season. Palermo striker Abel Hernandez is scheduled to have a medical at Hull City on Wednesday after the clubs agreed a £9.5million price. The 24-year-old turned down a move to Benfica and stated that he 'wanted to try a different league.' He took a flight to Hull on a private plane in the morning. A four-year contract offer has been submitted to the striker, reportedly worth £1.2million for the first year rising to £2million for the fourth. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Hernandez said: 'My future? Maurizio Zamparini told me that after the promotion to Serie A, he would let me leave. Do I want to quit Palermo? It can happen, but there’s nothing to say I don’t want to stay. We’ll see what happens.' New striker: Palermo's Abel Hernandez is set for a medical at Hull City . Too costly: Steve Bruce was looking to sign Blackburn's Jordan Rhodes but lost patience . Sunderland had also shown an interest in Hernandez while other clubs have been keen on a loan. Manager Steve Bruce had wanted to sign Blackburn Rovers striker Jordan Rhodes but the Championship club's reluctance to sell has slowed down negotiations and Hull can't afford to take too many chances with the window closing plus other clubs frantically searching for the same calibre of striker. Hernandez, 24, is a Uruguay international and has an impressive record for his country having scored seven goals in 14 games. His record at Palermo is closer to one every three games. He is 6ft 1in, fast, technically good and decent in the air. West Ham are in talks over a deal for Rennes defender Jean-Armel Kana-Biyik. The 25-year-old was an option for them at the start of the window and after a proposed move to Palermo stalled they have been given the chance to sign him again. The tough-tackling defender started his career in the youth ranks at Le Havre and retired from playing for Cameroon after being left out of their final World Cup squad. He has one year to run on his contract with Rennes and is available for around £1.25m. West Ham have finally sent Mali striker Modibo Maiga out on loan to FC Metz. The French Ligue 1 club have an option to buy the 26-year-old, who joined the Hammers from Sochaux in summer 2012, at the end of the campaign. Solidity: West Ham are in talks over a deal for Rennes defender Jean-Armel Kana-Biyik . Lazio will have to sell another non-EU player before they can attempt to push through a deal for Stoke City's Geoff Cameron. That could open the door for Sunderland who recognise that the USA international defender is frustrated at being left out of Stoke's starting line-up. Cameron has not asked for a transfer from the Britannia Stadium but is looking to play regularly after turning 29 in July and reaching the peak time of his career. The 6ft 3ins defender is a popular figure at Stoke among the squad but believes he may have to move on to get the game time he craves. Sunderland are keen to take him as he can play in a number of positions while Southampton, Leicester and Hull have also enquired. Lazio are also keen but red tape has ensured that is now unlikely with the window closing at the weekend in Italy. Out of favour: Several Premier League clubs, and Lazio, are monitoring Geoff Cameron's situation at Stoke . Former Tottenham and Manchester City defender Vedran Corluka is another target for Sunderland. The 28-year-old is playing for Lokomotiv Moscow but is keen on a return to the Premier League and the Russian club are happy to sell for around £4.8million. Corluka can play at centre-back and full-back and has over 75 caps for Croatia. His experience of the Premier League also makes him a safer option in many manager's eyes and Gus Poyet is keen to discuss a potential deal. Sunderland are also waiting on developments with Salomon Kalou after he was left out of Lille's Champions League squad to face Porto. Experience: Former Tottenham and Manchester City defender Vedran Corluka is a target for Sunderland . QPR are in talks with Gremio over a deal for young Brazilian centre-back Bressan. The 21-year-old only made his top flight bow in May 2013 but his agent has revealed a move to Loftus Road 'will probably happen'. 'A proposal was made [by QPR] that matches what we expected. But we are still waiting the club to make an official offer,' Bressan's agent Marcelo Lipatin told Globo Esporte. 'But the way things are going, [the transfer] will probably happen, all parties have reached an agreement.' Earlier this year, a group led by Giuliano Bertolucci and Kia Joorabchian purchased 50 per cent of Bressan’s economic rights. Gremio retained 20percent, while the other 30percent is split between Bressan, his representatives and other investors. Close: A deal for QPR to take Gremio defender Bressan has nearly been concluded . Norwich have made enquiries for former Leeds United target Frederik Sorensen from Juventus. Leeds had negotiated a fee with Juventus to take Sorensen to Elland Road on a season-long loan deal, but saw the agreement collapse when the player flew to England to seal the move. Verona, Genoa and Olympiacos are also interested in a loan but Norwich City have registered their interest in buying him outright. Leeds, meanwhile, have made another enquiry to Cagliari this time over midfielder Daniele Dessena, 27. Burnley are looking to revive a bid for Derby County defender Richard Keogh. The experienced 28-year-old was a target for Sean Dyche earlier in the summer along with teammate Craig Bryson. Burnley want extra bodies in before Monday and hope that Keogh will fit into their budget and the profile Dyche wants to blend in with his tight-knit team group. Dyche also has an interest in Bolton midfielder Mark Davies as competition heats up for his other target James McArthur of Wigan. Right type: Burnley manager Sean Dyche is looking to form a tight-nit group and wants Derby's Richard Keogh . Marseille have made a fresh approach for Newcastle United defender Mapou Yanga-Mwiba. The French side want the centre-back on a season loan with view to a permanent deal. Coach Marcelo Bielsa is also in talks with Barcelona over a deal for former Arsenal midfielder Alex Song. Marseille have a little extra cash to play with after claiming £1m as a sell-on clause from Mehdi Benatia's £27m move from Roma to Bayern Munich. Newcastle are battling it out with Fiorentina to sign Rayo Vallecano's Guinea international right winger Lass Bangoura, according to reports in Spain. The 22-year-old was left out of his club's La Liga opener against Atletico Madrid on Monday night. Blackburn have signed teenage goalkeeper Ryan Crump. The 18-year-old, who played for Scotland U17s, has signed a one-year deal at Ewood Park after leaving Liverpool.","Hull confirm interest in Holtby but Spurs have yet to receive formal approach .

"The resistance at Dale Farm has ended with a mass exodus. Travellers escorted their extremist supporters to the exit gates before themselves leaving the illegal site in a convoy of vans and caravans last night. Many of the vehicles moved to the legal area of the Essex camp, sparking fears that the Battle of Basildon is not over. On the road... but many of the caravans which have left the illegal pitch at Dale Farm in Essex have merely moved to the adjacent legal area of the site . Eviction completed: Travellers and their supporters walk out of Dale Farm near Basildon after being driven off the land by police and bailiffs at the end of a two-day stand off . Len Gridley, 52, whose home backs on to the illegal site, said: ‘It’s progress and good riddance to them. But some have just moved down the road and I am not going to be overjoyed until I am waving the last caravan goodbye.’ The exodus followed the toppling of a 45ft scaffolding tower that had become the symbol of the struggle. Bailiffs called in heavy machinery to demolish the structure, which a day earlier had been occupied by 20 activists. The final scenes in the decade-long . saga marked a victory for the council which has spent £22m of . taxpayers' cash clearing the former scrapyard in Basildon, Essex. Hundreds of riot police armed with Tasers stormed the site at dawn on Wednesday, swiftly gaining control despite facing a hail of bricks and being threatened with spades as two caravans were set on fire. Sporadic resistance continued for most of the day, but by nightfall the Battle of Basildon was all but won after 27 arrests. The . officials made the final push yesterday as they smashed through a . barricade to enter the site just before 10am. They used angle-grinders . to hack away the chains that the last six anarchists had used to lock . themselves to vehicles. Police and bailiffs watch as caravans are driven from the Dale Farm site. Hundreds of police officers in riot gear maintained a protective line as the site was emptied yesterday . Endgame: Police in riot gear stand guard yesterday as a caravan is driven away from the site. Bailiffs and police were securing the site after evicting the last of the activists . With virtually nobody left on the illegal pitch, a cherry picker . crane nicknamed 'the eater' began tearing down the 'crow's nest' scaffolding at the entrance. Around . 50 travellers watched proceedings from the adjoining legal site. More . than 200 had been living on the site until court proceedings reached a . climax last month. The other 150 are believed to have moved to other . pitches around the UK. Council . leader Tony Ball said: 'Where we are now is where we would like to have . been yesterday. We have residents leaving the site. The delay . was caused by violent resistance in the morning and peaceful resistance . in the afternoon. 'I am comfortable with the fact those carrying out the clearance are trained professionals and will behave accordingly.' Mr . Ball said the council has made travellers aware of alternative sites . and made offers, which have not been accepted, to provide for the . elderly, vulnerable and young. Demolition begins: Bailiffs enter a caravan, left, before they begin to dismantle the surrounding wall, right, as they start to take apart the illegal campsite . Day two: Police officers accompany council officials as they enter the Dale Farm site yesterday . Final exit: A group of female travellers follow a caravan as it is driven from Dale Farm yesterday . Hundreds . of police officers in riot gear maintained a protective line as workers . dealt with the tower and removed three vehicles blocking the only road . into the site. However an Essex Police spokesman said officers would increasingly hand over to bailiffs now the site is secured. Banners were draped around the site proclaiming ‘Save Dale Farm’ and accusing the authorities of ‘ethnic cleansing’, while children’s paintings were pinned to scaffolding. There was no sign of the fierce resistance – including rocks and missiles – that greeted the drive to clear the camp on Wednesday. Instead, masked sympathisers contented themselves with sitting on a nearby roof, chanting ‘bailiff scum’. Victory at last: A cherry picker crane pulls down scaffolding at the main entrance to the Dale Farm site. The metal tower had been the last barricade between the authorities and the illegal homes . Push off: Travellers guide the caravan through a narrow gap in the wall surrounding the neighbouring legal site . One traveller, who gave her name as Elby, said she was heartbroken to see the tower come down. ‘It was like a monument to our cause,’ she added. ‘When we drove towards it, it was like we were home.’ There were fears that some activists would make a final stand last night with petrol bombs. But the tension was defused by the plan hatched by travellers to escort their sympathisers to the front gate at 5pm. The legal site the travellers moved to has 34 pitches with a maximum of two caravans or static buildings allowed on each. Many families insisted they would not leave the area. One woman said: ‘I will stay in Basildon or somewhere in Essex. Maybe we’ll go and park outside (council leader) Tony Ball’s place. Essex is our home, for God’s sake.’ Superintendent Trevor Roe of Essex Police said 34 activists had been arrested for a range of offences in the clearance operation. He said 11 officers had suffered minor injuries, including cuts and bruises, in the clashes. Leaving: An Irish traveller walks past the remains of a burnt out barricade in front of riot police.

"Joel Clark, 37, charged with killing domestic animal and torture in Indiana after he baked a friend's dog . A house guest is facing felony charges after he allegedly killed a friend's dog by putting the canine in a sweltering oven. Joel Clark, 37, was being held on Thursday at the Marion County Jail in Indiana. He faces charges of killing a domestic animal and torturing or mutilating a vertebrate animal, according to new court documents. Prosecutors said Clark was on house arrest and living with two friends, Christina Kelley and Richard Smith at the time. Miss Kelley found Zane, a Miniature Pinscher, dead on May 18. The little dog was discovered in the bottom of a trash can. The woman was then horrified to discover dog hair and a toenail on a cookie sheet and pizza pan in the oven, court documents said. A necropsy found that the dog's whiskers were burned, it had burn marks on its legs and feet and blood on its snout and mouth. Court documents said Clark told one of the friends that he had killed the dog about 30 minutes before its body was discovered, but they did not believe him. The dog's owners had no idea of Clark's motive. He also told one of the friends that he 'could take care of that dog, too' when a pitbull walked past them, the documents said. The friends ordered Clark to leave their home after they found Zane dead, court documents said. Miss Kelley and Mr Smith said that they were aghast by the death of their pet and totally bewildered because no argument had taken place before the brutal killing, according to the Indy Star. Along with the animal cruelty charges, Clark has also been charged with escape relating to the violation of his house arrest for allegedly resisting a previous arrest. He will appear in court on Wednesday for a pre-trial hearing.

The group - Holmesdale Fanatics - chanted 'We f****** hate Sky Sports' and unveiled a banner which read 'Sky Sports - killing our game since 1992'. Several red flares were released as fans marched down a road, leaving Solhekol with little option but to stop reporting. VIDEO Holmesdale Fanatics shout obscene anti Sky Sports chants .

I'm on TV: Fans enjoyed deadline day - there is no suggestion the supporters in this picture were swearing . The group was formed in 2005 by fans who had stood at the back of the Holmesdale Stand at Selhurst Park. Their aim was to create a strong unit based on the terraces of old. Palace keeper Julian Speroni hailed the group's support as 'brilliant' last season. His colleague Geraint Hughes, meanwhile, had to move inside at Arsenal to announce the £16million signing of Danny Welbeck from Manchester United. As a result of these and other embarrassing incidents, Sky Sports are under pressure to make changes to their show. The television network's visual coverage of the day's events has become hugely popular in recent years. Sky Sports News' tried-and-trusted formula is to deploy reporters and camera crews at all 20 Premier League clubs and many others around the country. Throughout the day, however, the 20 news teams - who hosted 270 live broadcasts - are usually joined by dozens of supporters keen to join in the excitement.

"CLICK HERE to register - for FREE - and start picking your £100million squad now... The madness that is the summer transfer window finished with a manic transfer deadline day, with some eye-catching new recruits for some of the top Premier League sides. With the international break almost over and the Premier League returning this weekend with some mouthwatering fixtures, what better time than to refresh your MailOnline Fantasy Football side than right now. Here, Sportsmail has picked 10 of the best deadline-day signings who should be given serious consideration when you look to make changes to your side. Exciting: (left to right) Radamel Falcao, Hatem Ben Arfa, Marcos Rojo and Danny Welbeck all moved clubs . Radamel Falcao (Manchester United) - Fantasy Football value: £10.3m . One of the most surprising moves on deadline day, but also one of the biggest. Falcao guarantees United goals - and he can also guarantee you points if you select him. Despite having to compete with Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney for a starting place up front at Old Trafford, no club pays someone £280,000-a-week and a £6m loan fee if they do not intend to start them. The 28-year-old Colombian scored 13 goals in 22 games at Monaco last season, he netted 70 times in 91 appearances for Atletico Madrid and he struck on 72 occasions for Porto in just 87 matches. Falcao is the sixth-most-expensive striker in the game at £10.3m, yet he is well worth the investment because he will bring you point after point with his goals. Even worth a serious consideration as your captain. New boy: Radamel Falcao joined Manchester United on a season-long loan deal this summer . Goal machine: Falcao's form for Monaco prompted United to bring the Colombian to Old Trafford . National service: Falcao in action for Colombia in a friendly against Brazil last week . Danny Welbeck (Arsenal) - Fantasy Football value: £9.0m . Arsenal needed to sign a striker and they have poached one of England's brightest talents from United with the £15m signing of Welbeck. Welbeck found himself out of favour under Louis van Gaal at United but, if he is given the role as the main striker at Arsenal in Olivier Giroud's absence, then the 23-year-old can bring goals. He may have only scored 20 goals in 92 appearances for United but Welbeck has been deployed on the left or brought on from the bench a lot at Old Trafford, which have affected his statistics. His two goals for England in Switzerland prove he is on a hot streak of form too. Given the correct service, a run in the side and the fact he has the ability to provide assists for his team-mates, at £9.0m - and with 23 strikers costing you more on the game - he could be a shrewd signing. Southampton's Jay Rodriguez (£9.5m) and West Ham United's crocked striker Andy Carroll (£9.2m) will cost you more! Still in red: Danny Welbeck switched from Manchester United to Arsenal in a £16 million deadline-day move . Double trouble: Welbeck slots home his, and England's, second goal as they saw off Switzerland . Hatem Ben Arfa (Hull City) - Fantasy Football value: £6.7m . Alan Pardew decided he could no longer put up with Ben Arfa at Newcastle United but the Frenchman has moved to Hull with a point to prove. A return of 14 goals and 18 assists in 86 appearances on Tyneside prove what Ben Arfa is capable of when he is on song and motivated, so the KC Stadium may be in for a treat. There are 41 midfielders who will cost your more than Ben Arfa (£6.7m) - including Crystal Palace's Jason Puncheon (£7.6m) and Chelsea's Mohamed Salah (£7.4m) - and the 27-year-old Frenchman is certainly worth consideration for your side. New face: Hull City signed Hatem Ben Arfa on loan from Newcastle United for the remainder of the season . Up in arms: Ben Arfa was frustrated by his lack of playing time at Newcastle but can thrive at Hull . Marcos Rojo (Manchester United) - Fantasy Football value: £5.8m . The Argentine has a fiery temper but he is a player who Van Gaal was keen to bring to Old Trafford - even waiting several weeks for his work permit to finally be ratified, meaning he qualifies for this list despite having been signed a couple of weeks before the deadline. Five red cards in Portugal for Sporting Lisbon suggest the 24-year-old could cost you points through his discipline but he should excel in defence in a very new-look United side. At £5.8m, Rojo is the 22nd most-expensive defender - cheaper the Manchester City's Matija Nastasic (£6.0m) and Liverpool's Mamadou Sakho (£5.9m) - so his disciplinary record is almost certainly worth the risk. Desperate: Marcos Rojo can't wait for his Manchester United debut after receiving his work permit . In action: Rojo played in the 4-2 victory for Argentina over Germany on Wednesday night in Dusseldorf . Toby Alderweireld (Southampton) - Fantasy Football value: £4.9m . Southampton held off competition from Newcastle for Alderweireld's signature on loan from Atletico Madrid. The 25-year-old is tall and powerful and will prove an excellent replacement for the departed Dejan Lovren in the Saints defence. There are 47 defenders who will cost you more than Alderweireld (£4.9m) - including Hull's Michael Dawson (£5.2m) and Man United's Chris Smalling (£5.4m) - meaning the Belgian is a bargain. New boy: Toby Alderweireld poses in his Southampton shirt after sealing a season-long loan move . Heads up: The ex-Ajax man struggled for playing time at Atletico, prompting his move to the Premier League . Daley Blind (Manchester United) - Fantasy Football value: £5.8m . Another player who has been brought to United by Van Gaal, Blind could also benefit from the new-look side. The 24-year-old is highly regarded in his native Holland and he will provide assists - just like the one for Van Persie's wonder-header during the World Cup - as well as shore up United's defence. With 21 defenders more expensive than Blind (£5.8m) - including Arsenal's Kieran Gibbs (£6.0m) and United team-mate Luke Shaw (£6.0m) - he can prove a cheaper alternative. New beginnings:  Daley Blind joined Manchester United in a £14million move from Ajax on deadline day . International pedigree: Blind's performances at Ajax have made him a regular in the Dutch national team . Abel Hernandez (Hull City) - Fantasy Football value: £8.1m . The Uruguayan has yet to fulfil his potential but Steve Bruce was confident enough to spend a club-record £9.5m to bring him to the KC Stadium. A return of 36 goals in 122 games for Palermo is solid if unspectacular but, with his pace and power, Hernandez can provide assists as well as finding the net. Stoke City's Jonathan Walters (£8.3m) and Newcastle's misfiring forward Papiss Cisse (£8.4m) are just a couple of the 33 strikers who will cost you more than Hernandez (£8.1m), even if the 24-year-old's price tag still seems a little steep. New arrival: Abel Hernandez completed a £9.5m club-record move to Hull City from Palermo on deadline day . Decent record: Hernandez netted 14 times for Palermo as they were promoted from Serie B last season . George Boyd (Burnley) - Fantasy Football value: £5.4m . Hardly a marquee signing but 28-year-old Boyd could provide Sean Dyche's side with some much-needed attacking firepower. Goals have been hard to come-by in recent years for Boyd but he has found himself in and then out of the side - and assists are a regular feature for a man who Burnley can build their attack around. With 104 midfielders costing you more than Boyd (£5.4m) - including Everton's Bryan Oviedo (£5.9m) and West Bromwich Albion's Silvestre Varela (£5.9m) - he is worth at least a spot on your bench as backup. Done deal: George Boyd has completed a move to Burnley after failing to hold down a regular place at Hull . Flourish: Boyd is hoping to get regular game time at Burnley and help keep them in the Premier League . Sadio Mane (Southampton) - Fantasy Football value: £5.8m . This 22-year-old Senegalese midfielder is exciting fans on the South Coast - and from his statistics you can see why. With 45 goals in 87 appearances for Red Bull Salzburg in Austria, Mane has figures worthy of a striker. What's more, Mane (£5.8m) is just the 93rd most-expensive striker on the game - with Hull's Robert Snodgrass (£6.2m) and Newcastle's Yoan Gouffran (£6.1m) cost more. What a bargain! New man: Sadio Mane signed for Southampton from Red Bull Salzburg for a fee in the region of £12million . Clinical: Mane scored an incredible 45 goals in just 87 appearances from midfield for Red Bull Salzburg . Ricardo Alvarez (Sunderland) - Fantasy Football value: £6.6m . Alvarez could be key to Sunderland's chances in the league this year and he could also be crucial to where you finish in your Fantasy Football league. A return of 14 goals and 19 assists in 90 games for Inter Milan show just how many points Alvarez could accrue for your side. The Argentinian is cheaper than 43 other midfielders - including Man City's Frank Lampard (£7.0m), who is unlikely to play, and Sunderland team-mate Adam Johnson (£7.2m) - meaning he is excellent value for money. Physical presence: Ricky Alvarez signed for Sunderland on loan from Inter Milan on deadline day .

"Peggy Young only has to look at her younger daughter to be reminded how long she has fought United Parcel Service over its treatment of pregnant employees, and why. Young was pregnant with Triniti, who's now 7 years old, when UPS told Young that she could not have a temporary assignment to avoid lifting heavy packages, as her doctor had ordered. 'They told me basically to go home and come back when I was no longer pregnant,' Young said in an interview with The Associated Press. 'I couldn't believe it.' Discrimination: Peggy Young sued shipping company UPS for allegedly discriminating against her when she was pregnant seven years ago. Pictured above with youngest daughter Triniti, now 7 . She sued the Atlanta-based package-delivery company for discriminating against pregnant women. She lost two rounds in lower courts, but the Supreme Court will hear her case Wednesday. The 42-year-old Young, who lives in Lorton, Virginia, said her persistence is not only for herself. 'I am fighting for my two daughters and I'm fighting for women who want to start a family and provide for the family at the same time,' she said. UPS spokeswoman Kara Gerhardt Ross said the law is on the company's side. 'UPS did not intentionally discriminate,' Ross said. The outcome could have wide-ranging effects. Three-quarters of women entering the workforce today will become pregnant at least once while employed, and many will work throughout their pregnancies, employment discrimination expert Katherine Kimpel wrote in a court brief. Some will experience complications or physical effects that cause them to ask their employers for a change of duties or other modifications, Kimpel said. High court: The U.S. Supreme Court will hear Young's lawsuit on Wednesday. She has lost her case two rounds in lower courts. The Supreme Court pictured above on October 6, 2014 . Young's case hinges on the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, a law that Congress passed in 1978 specifically to include discrimination against pregnant women as a violation of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Congress acted after the Supreme Court, then composed entirely of men, said workplace rules that excluded pregnant workers from disability benefits and insurance coverage did not amount to sex discrimination under the landmark civil rights law. The question in Young's case is whether UPS violated the law through its policy of providing temporary light-duty work only to employees who had on-the-job injuries, were disabled under federal law or lost their federal driver certification. 'If you were painting your house and fell off a ladder, or if you had a ski accident, that wouldn't qualify for restricted light duty. That's where pregnancy fell at that time. It was not covered in any state law except California's,' Ross said. UPS also notes in its court filings that the Postal Service, an independent agency that receives no tax dollars but is subject to congressional control, maintains an identical policy when it comes to pregnant workers. The Postal Service declined comment. The Obama administration and 120 congressional Democrats are supporting Young. The reason for the work limitation is less important than the company's decision to distinguish between pregnant and nonpregnant workers with similar restrictions on the work they can do, Young and the administration told the court. An unusual array of liberal, conservative, labor and women's interest groups also has lined up behind Young. The pregnancy discrimination law 'protects the unborn child as well as the working mother who faces economic and other difficulties in bearing and raising the child,' lawyer Carrie Severino wrote on behalf of anti-abortion organizations. UPS employed Young as a part-time driver whose main job was to deliver overnight letters by 8:30 a.m. UPS requires people in those jobs to be able to lift packages as heavy as 70 pounds. Young said she rarely handled anything over 20 pounds and dealt almost exclusively with letters that sat on the passenger seat of her van. In 2006, Young, then in her mid-30s, took a leave of absence to undergo in vitro fertilization in her desire to have a third child. On the third try, she became pregnant. Unfair? Young says when she was pregnant seven years ago, working for UPS, her doctor ordered her not to lift anything over 20 pounds. When she asked for a temporary reassignment, she claims the company denied the request. Above, a stock image of a UPS worker in San Francisco . Young wanted to return to work, and her doctor and a midwife wrote notes saying she should not lift packages heavier than 20 pounds. But UPS told Young she could not continue in her job and did not qualify for a temporary assignment. Unable to work, Young also lost her medical and pension benefits, although she was covered under husband's health insurance. 'The benefits were good and benefits were hard to find with part-time jobs,' she said. Young eventually returned to UPS, but left in 2009, a year after she sued. She argued that because UPS made accommodations for nonpregnant employees with work restrictions, it should have done the same for her. But lower courts dismissed the suit, agreeing that Young did not prove UPS discriminated against her because of her pregnancy. The justices agreed in July to review the case. Since then, there have been two notable developments. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission updated guidance to employers to make clear that they should accommodate people in Young's situation. UPS itself has changed its policy so that pregnant employees will be eligible for light-duty work. 'UPS believed it was appropriate to update its workplace policies so that we can attract and retain the best workforce we can,' Ross said. The change does not affect Young, now a contractor for the federal Customs and Border Protection agency. Looking back, Young said the situation was so upsetting because she felt she was able to work and considered herself pretty tough. Recalling the birth of her second child, Young said, 'I was at work when I went into labor.' The case is Young v. UPS, 12-1226.","Peggy Young was working as a driver for UPS seven years ago when her doctor ordered her not to lift anything over 20lbs .

"Swansea manager Garry Monk could hand Tom Carroll a Capital One Cup debut after acknowledging why the Spurs starlet has been compared to Luka Modric. Carroll joined Swansea on a season-long loan last Friday but did not figure in the matchday squad for the Premier League victory over Burnley the following day as it was considered too soon for him to play a part. But Carroll and Argentina defender Federico Fernandez, who has received international clearance to play after his £8million move from Napoli, could both make their Swansea debuts against Championship outfit Rotherham on Tuesday night. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Tom Carroll trounce Raheem Sterling at table tennis . Talent: Swansea boss Garry Monk has compared Tom Carroll (above) to Real Madrid star Luka Modric . Swan: The 22-year-old midfielder poses with a Swansea shirt ahead of last weekend's game . Monk wanted midfield cover with Leon Britton ruled out for a month by knee trouble but he said England Under-21 international Carroll had been on Swansea's radar for some time. 'He's a very good footballer who will very much suit us,' Monk said ahead of the second-round tie at the Liberty Stadium. 'We've watched him, done our analysis over the years, seen him at Spurs and a lot of him at QPR. 'I've spoken to a lot of people who have trained with him and coached him and they speak very highly of him . 'He can show that good side of football we need because he's good with the ball. 'He can pass and move and get himself in good positions and I think he'll offer us another option.' Carroll and Modric were Tottenham team-mates before the Croatian playmaker joined Real Madrid in 2012 and their styles as creative midfielders has often been compared. LEarnng curve: Carroll and Modric (left) were Tottenham team-mates before the Croatian joined Madrid . But Carroll, who has made 23 Spurs appearances since making his debut in 2011, has had to leave White Hart Lane to gain more first-team experience, first at Leyton Orient and then in the Championship at Derby and Queens Park Rangers. 'I can see why people say that about him and Modric,' Monk said. 'A lot of people will talk about the strength side of the game but it's something we believe in here. 'We've shown over the years with Leon and Joe Allen that if you pass the ball quickly and move quickly it doesn't matter about the physical side of the game. New boy: Monk (right) signed Carroll on a season-long loan last Friday, but the midfielder is yet to feature . 'He can improve on that side, but he suits our philosophy and I think he can show what a good footballer he is and we believe he is.' Swansea won the Capital One Cup two seasons ago when Michael Laudrup was in charge and Monk would relish another run in the competition after making a flying start to the Premier League campaign. Monk is expected to rotate his squad ahead of Saturday's league visit from West Brom but he wants to keep the momentum going after opening top-flight wins against Manchester United and Burnley. Points: Monk's Swansea side have enjoyed a bright start to the season, winning both of their first two games . 'It's been a great cup for us and I want us to do well again,' Monk said. 'When you've won two games in a row you want to keep that momentum going and this is the next game for us. 'A cup run gives everyone confidence and we don't want to give anything up easily. 'We want to fight for everything, every cup game, every league game.'","Garry Monk compares Tom Carroll to Real Madrid star Luka Modric .

"A small fragment of ancient pottery researchers believe shows the first wine label could prove that the reigns of King Solomon and King David actually occurred. The 10th century BC 'Ophel Inscription' was unearthed last year, and scientists were initially baffled by the bizarre language that was inscribed on the remains of a jug. A new translation reveals the contents of a jar was 'lousy' plonk intended for slaves - and sheds new light on society at the time. Scroll down for video . The label dates from second half of the 10th Century BC and was discovered in the Ophel area of Jerusalem, south of Temple Mount . The word on the pitcher reads 'yayin' or wine and he believes it should read 'in the year [¿ ]M, wine, part, m[¿]' in a form of ancient Hebrew, according to professor Galil . A rare trove of coins and jewellery was found buried near temple Mount in Jerusalem in September 2013. It included 36 gold coins dating back to the seventh century with images of Byzantine emperors and a 10cm medallion etched with a  Menorah, Shofar made from a Ram's horn and a Torah scroll. A 3,000-year-old earthenware jug was found - which is the same one that has now been deciphered. The discovery was made in the ruins of a Byzantine public structure located in the Ophel region - between the city of David and around 50 metres from the southern wall of the First Temple. Temple Mount is considered one of the most religious sites in Jerusalem and is where two biblical Jewish temples once stood. It is also a site of Muslim interest site known as the Haram as-Sharif, or Noble Sanctuary. This area is thought to be part of an ancient city wall in Jerusalem dating back to the 10th century BC, possibly built by King Solomon. The label is thought to be the most ancient Hebrew engraving to emerge from the archaeological digs in Jerusalem to date. 'We are dealing here with real kings, and the kingdom of David and Solomon was a real fact,' Gershon Galil from the department of Jewish History at Haifa University told FoxNews.com. Some experts previously claimed it was written in an ancient near Eastern language, but Galil believes it is actually a form of ancient Hebrew. The inscription is eight letters long and was engraved on a large clay pitcher in the second half of the 10th century BC in Biblical times, which was used to store cheap wine. It was found in the Ophel area of the city, south of Temple Mount, as part of a dig by the Archaeological Institute at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. A word on the pitcher reads ‘yayin’ or wine and he believes the whole inscription should read ‘in the year [… ]M, wine, part, m[…]’. Professor Galil explained the first missing word ends with ‘mem,’ which is the final part of the word for the 20th or 30th year of the kingdom and effectively dates the wine. The middle portion or ‘wine, part’ indicates the type of wine contained in the jar and in the Ugarit . language from northern Syria, a similar word to 'yayin' means the lowest quality of wine. The . final letter has been cut off from a longer word, but Professor . Gahil thinks it could indicate where the wine came from. The discovery was made in the ruins of a Byzantine public structure located  in the Ophel region between the city of David and the southern wall of the First Temple, (pictured). This area is thought to be part of an ancient city wall of Jerusalem dating back to the 10th century BC, possibly built by King Solomon . Professor Galil recently  told The Archaeology News Network: ‘This wine wasn’t served to Solomon’s emissaries, or in the temple, but apparently was for the slave construction workers who worked in the area.’ Archaeologists already know that poor quality wine was drunk by soldiers and slave builders and believe that it was stored in large vessels that did not keep it particularly fresh, like the one found in the dig six months ago. Professor Galil thinks the carving was produced after King Solomon had built the first temple, his palaces and city walls. The earthenware jar that is now known to contain cheap wine, was found in the Ophel archaeological area in Jerusalem, where other treasures, including a number of Byzantine coins have been discovered . The find sheds light on the Biblical kingdom’s sophisticated society, where many people were thought to be literate, taxes were collected and builders recruited and bought to Jerusalem to build palaces and other infrastructure, according to the study, which was published in the journal New Studies on Jerusalem. Some historians dispute information gleaned from the Bible that Jerusalem was an important city, but supporters of the Biblical accounts, including Professor Galil, believe the inscription supports stories that tell of complicated administrative systems and a strictly hierarchical society. ‘Scribes that could write administrative texts could also write literary and historiographic texts and this has very important implications for the study of the Bible and understanding the history of Israel in the biblical period,’ he added. Dr Jonathan Stokl, a lecturer in Hebrew Bible and the Old Testament, from King’s College London told MailOnline: ‘The inscription is written in what is variously called “proto-Canaanite” or “late Canaanite” script. A 10cm medallion etched with a Menorah, Shofar made from a ram's horn and a Torah scroll, (pictured) was found at the same site as the earthenware jug inscribed with the wine label. However, the medallion dates from the 7th Century, unlike the older wine container . The language is probably an early form of Hebrew, but it could be a closely related dialect spoken in Jerusalem in the 10th century.’ He explained that at the time the inscription was made, the way words were written had not been agreed upon so some people wrote from left to right (like English) while others wrote in the opposite direction, like with modern Hebrew and Arabic. While Professor Galil has interpreted the inscription from right to left, another academic, Professor Christopher Rollinston has read it in the opposite way, but has not arrived upon a clear meaning. ‘Irrespective of what the reading of the inscription is, it attests to someone writing Hebrew (or a closely related language) in the 10th century in Jerusalem, probably for administrative reasons,’ he said. ‘Professor Galil suggests that this indicates that the inscription was made by some royal administration (something like an early civil service) and I believe that he is probably correct with that.' The inscription was found in Ophel, near near Temple Mount in Jerusalem (pictured) in December last year . The inscription was found among a pile of pottery (pictured). Leading expert Douglas Petrovich believes the language is a primitive form of Hebrew which suggests the ancient Israelites were recording history much earlier than previously thought .","The label dates from second half of the 10th Century BC and was discovered in the Ophel area of Jerusalem, south of Temple Mount .

"The owner of a controversial bikini coffee stand business faces charges of prostitution and money laundering after local prosecutors alleged her baristas were selling sex acts for tips. Snohomish County prosecutors say that 52-year-old Carmela Panico, a former nude dancer, operated drive-thru brothels in the county north of Seattle with coffee stands named Twin Peaks and Java Juggs. According to charging documents, her baristas made tips saying they could earn hundreds of thousands of dollars by performing sex acts and could make up to $14 by baring their breasts or genitals. The Java Juggs coffee stand in Washington state, which 52-year-old Carmela Panico is said to have run . Authorities also allege that baristas had a certain amount of cash they were supposed to make for Panico, and the rest the women could keep. The documents also say that Panico could deduct money if the women failed to wear high heels throughout their shifts, did not have a tan or failed to put on makeup. It has been reported that some of her employees could earn between $15,000 and $30,000 a month, while one saying she had earned half-a-million working at the stands. 'The sales goals were effectively rent that the girls paid to have the opportunity to perform lewd conduct or acts of prostitution,' deputy prosecutor Bob Hendrix wrote in the report. 'Her profit margin at times was twice that of well-run, established coffee stands. 'Pancino's businesses were driven by prostitution and lewd behaviour,' Mr Hendrix added. She was charged on Thursday, the Everett Herald reported. The Twin Peaks stand, which prosecutors allege Panico operated as a 'drive-thru brothel' Authorities also allege that she didn't report her full earnings to the Internal Revenue Service by dealing in large amounts of cash. A search at Panico's home last year resulted in the seizure of nearly $250,000. But her attorney told Snohomish County Superior Court that she left the coffee business and sold some of her stands and leased others. The investigation has also led to the prosecution of veteran sheriff's sergeant Darrell O'Neill, who is accused of tipping off Panico and her workers to police scrutiny in return for sexual favors. O'Neill resigned after his arrest last year and has pleaded not guilty. His trial is scheduled for November.","Carmela Panico accused of operating brothels from her coffee stands .

"The blame game has started since Manchester United’s mauling in Milton Keynes and nobody has been spared. Louis van Gaal, only a few weeks into his reign at Old Trafford, has been criticised for picking an inexperienced team, playing a system that is alien to his squad —and signing autographs immediately after that 4-0 defeat. David Moyes, sacked in April, had the spotlight on him. He was at fault, so the arguments went, because he wasn’t brutal enough when he arrived last summer and failed to get rid of the players who were not up to United standard. Under pressure: Louis van Gaal has endured a rocky start to his reign as Manchester United manager . Shock: United were thrashed 4-0 by MK Dons in their Capital One Cup second-round tie . The players have been blasted. So, too, have the Glazer family and chief executive Ed Woodward. But another figure has been embroiled in the post-mortem. When his name was mentioned, however, I found myself shaking my head in disbelief. Sir Alex Ferguson. He should have left a better squad, the theory goes. He left United weak because he did not sign better players and, as a result, his legacy is being damaged because United appear to be in freefall. Van Gaal has claimed he will need a year to turn the situation. I find it remarkable anyone could genuinely feel Ferguson has anything to do with what is happening now. What we are actually seeing, with each passing week, is how far Ferguson’s genius stretched and just how much of an impact he had on the club. Blow: Gylfi Sigurdsson scored the winner as Swansea beat United 2-1 at Old Trafford on the opening day . Consider this: on August 28, 2011, United demolished Arsenal 8-2 at Old Trafford. The performance was widely described as being ‘spell-binding’ and ‘ruthless’ and was the product of slick football. They terrorised Arsenal with the speed of their passing and movement. The team Ferguson selected that day was as follows: David de Gea; Phil Jones, Chris Smalling, Jonny Evans, Patrice Evra: Nani, Tom Cleverley, Anderson: Ashley Young, Wayne Rooney and Danny Welbeck. Three weeks later, the majority of that team lined up against Chelsea and beat them 3-1. Makes you think, doesn’t it? Of the XI who tackled Arsenal, all bar Evra started the current campaign at the club. Some, such as Cleverley and Welbeck, could move before the transfer window closes on Monday but three years ago they were being hailed as United’s future. Held back: Despite Juan Mata's goal, United were held to a 1-1 draw at Sunderland . It has to be said that some of the above named now look distinctly average but Ferguson got the best out of them. He had a unique ability to drive United on to win titles and squeeze every last drop out of his players. He drummed into them that they were the best and made them believe it. Ferguson had an aura. It wasn’t just in matches. On a Friday afternoon, you would hear opposition managers talking about what bottle of wine they intended bringing him, sounding beaten before they had turned up at Old Trafford. We all know he was partial to making comments about referees before big games. And there were times when I saw him waiting in the tunnel for the official. I made it my job to man-mark the referee so Fergie couldn’t bend his ear! United always had a way of winning under Ferguson, even when they were not at their best. You had to fight to the last second for every point you took off them and you always knew how dangerous they were to cope with in the dying moments if a game was delicately poised. Glittering: Sir Alex Ferguson ended his long reign at Old Trafford with the title in 2013 . How much was down to him? More than you would think. Last season, they scored seven times between the 81st and 90th minute — the period when they always seemed to get one more chance under Ferguson — but not one goal secured them a point. In 2012-13, his final campaign, United scored 12 late goals. They were worth nine points. What United are discovering now is that they are in the real world. Ferguson distorted reality for the Glazers and, in some way, the supporters through his ability to keep getting spectacular results on a consistent basis. He broke the British transfer record five times before the Glazers came in 2005 but only did it once — for Dimitar Berbatov — after they arrived. Yet between 2007 and 2013, Ferguson led them to the Barclays Premier League five times. The years they missed out (2010 and 2012), they had a chance to win it on the final day. Misery: David Moyes was sacked after one season in which United missed out on the top four . During a period in which Chelsea’s Roman Abramovich and Manchester City’s Sheik Mansour attempted to exert their financial power, to keep United ahead of the game without spending like their rivals was remarkable. At the start of this season, I said things would never be the same again for Manchester United and the £237.1million they have spent since Ferguson has gone into retirement is not going to recreate the success his teams enjoyed for over 20 years. It was only down to Ferguson that the Glazers never had to spend like this before. One thing that is beyond doubt is that Manchester United — and football in general — are unlikely to see another like him. That’s why I find it startling that his name was included in the recriminations that followed United’s Capital One Cup capitulation. The only mistake Ferguson has made is underestimating just how good he actually was. Milan move is best option for Torres . So Fernando Torres’s time in English football is over and I am glad he is heading to AC Milan. I have said in these pages before that I don’t like to see players who are on big contracts sitting on the bench and hopefully a move to the San Siro will revive his confidence. When Torres joined us at Liverpool in 2007, he was in the top four strikers in world football. Big, strong and quick, he used to leave defenders trailing and his goal return was magnificent. The end: Fernando Torres is heading to AC Milan on a two-year loan deal from Chelsea . Jumping for joy: Torres in training with Chelsea at their base in Cobham . Machine: The Spaniard earned a reputation as one of Europe's best strikers during his time at Liverpool . Clash: Jamie Carragher was impressed by the character displayed by the Spanish striker . It was a joy to be on the same team as him during that period and what really impressed me about him was his character. He would stand up to defenders and was never someone who could be bullied out of a game. He could give as good as he got. The Torres who joined Chelsea in January 2011, though, was not the same forward who arrived from Atletico Madrid and we had seen the deterioration in him over his final 18 months at Anfield. Appearances: 142 . Goals: 81 . Goals per game ratio: 1.8 matches . Cost per goal (signed for £24m): £296,000 . Appearances: 172 . Goals: 45 . Goals per game ratio: 3.8 matches . Cost per goal (signed for £50m): £1.1m . Lethal: Torres scored 81 goals in 142 games during his three and a half years at Liverpool . Strike: Torres holds off Rio Ferdinand to score in a 2-0 win over Manchester United at Anfield in 2009 . Dry: The Spaniard only managed 45 goals for Chelsea after a £50m move to Stamford Bridge . Slowing down: Torres' pace was one of his biggest assets during his time at Liverpool . He suffered some knee and hamstring injuries and when explosive players like him are hindered by such problems, it is difficult to recapture the spark. So much of Fernando’s game was based on his pace and he found himself unable to race away from defenders as he used to. People wondered why he couldn’t do for Chelsea what he had initially done for Liverpool but we were never surprised. If anything, we were pleased with the £50million transfer fee we received for him, even if we didn’t reinvest it properly. Torres might not have scaled the heights that were expected of him in London but he still leaves with a collection of some of the game’s biggest medals. It will be interesting to see if a switch to Italy revives his goalscoring talent. This week I'm looking forward to seeing... How Jack Colback and Fabian Delph fare after being called into the England squad. While not many would have expected to see Roy Hodgson include their names in his party for the games against Norway and Switzerland, England’s manager will not have selected them on a whim. Both players will find this weekend that they are judged differently, as the moment you are selected for England you find your games scrutinised like never before. It is important they handle all the extra attention. Call up: Fabian Delph (left) and Jack Colback (right) have been named in Roy Hodgson's England squad . Colback clearly has no issues over dealing with the mental side of the game. He made a big decision in moving from Sunderland to neighbours Newcastle United but he has settled in quickly on Tyneside and uses the ball well. As for Delph, he should not be regarded as a surprise inclusion. He is someone who was talked about as having England potential 10 months ago and might have had a chance by now were it not for injury. He has been Aston Villa’s best player and both will be desperate to win their first caps at some point in the friendly against Norway. Before then, though, it will be interesting to see how Colback does against Crystal Palace and Delph gets on against Hull.","Manchester United without a win yet this season under Louis van Gaal .

"Adulterers are texting their way into trouble over Christmas - with divorce lawyers saying the festive season is one of the most dangerous times for getting caught out. Family get togethers mean cheating partners often rely on their mobile phones to stay in contact with their lovers. But that increases the risk of illicit relationships being found out through phones left carelessly lying around, or partners becoming suspicious of texts or calls. Found out: amily get togethers mean cheating partners often rely on their mobile phones to stay in contact with their lovers (file picture) Ayesha Vardag, named the UK’s top divorce lawyer by the Law Society, said ‘Christmas text message bustings’ have become increasingly common due to constant use of mobile phones - even during family occasions. ‘People are suddenly holed up with their family but those in any other relationship are very conscious of being shut out. ‘They are going off up the garden to try to make calls and sending messages and then the phone ends up lying around the house.’ Miss Vardag, who has acted in splits including the £100 million divorce of German heiress Katrin Radmacher, added that she first noticed the growth of ‘text message bustings’ at Christmas last year. Patricia Robinson, a senior associate in family law at Manchester-based Pannone Solicitors, said: ‘If someone is texting a lover during Christmas lunch with their partner and family then it could be said that they are asking for trouble. ‘In my experience, though, it is unusual for evidence of adultery to suddenly come to light. Christmas increases the risk of illicit relationships being found out through phones left carelessly lying around (file picture) ‘It is more often the case that a husband or wife will become suspicious and then investigate further by checking their partner’s mobile phone and social media pages. ‘It is true that the notion something may not be right does sometimes originate as a result of Christmas parties, particularly those involving work colleagues.’ Philanderers’ problems are compounded by alcohol and heightened emotions, according to Voula Grand, a psychologist and novelist whose book Honor’s Shadow charts marital betrayal. ‘It is a perfect storm – everybody has had a few drinks, everybody is talking more, you haven’t got time alone when you could communicate and the temptation is too great,’ she said. ‘You have got his intense family time but you have got two families in effect. ‘You can imagine the pull – you would want to make some contact over that period and I think people would take greater risks. ‘The other side of it is that families are home and all together, you haven’t got that time apart where it is easier for you to make contact with your lover.’","Family get togethers mean cheating partners often rely on mobile phones .

"It's the dream of every internet startup founder to sell their company for millions of dollars. But not everyone can make a quick buck like Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg or the investors of Instagram who recouped enormous  amounts of money on their original investments. In the case of one startup, Bloodhound . Technologies, the five founders were left with comparatively little even . though their company sold for tens of millions of dollars, according to the New York Times. Disappointment: Bloodhound Technologies founder Joseph A. Carsanaro (left) and four co-founders including Aaron Seib (right) were left to split $36,000 after their company sold $82 million . Bloodhound was formed in the mid-1990s to create software for health care providers to monitor claims for fraud. Mr Carsanaro began the company with four colleagues -  Samir Abed, Aaron Seib, Aldo Kiamtia, and Barry . Taylor - and raised $1.9 million from venture capitalists in . 1999. The following year he raised another $3.1 million. When Bloodhound Technologies was sold for $82.5 million in 2011, the five founders were paid a collective $36,000. Here's what each founder received: . The timing was not in Mr Carsanaro's favor, however. Within just a few years the internet bubble burst and the company began to struggle. That's when investors took over the company and pushed out Carsonaro as CEO. According to court proceedings, the investors convinced Bloodhound's board that replacing Carsonaro with a new CEO would make the company more marketable to potential buyers. Carsonaro was asked to resign in December 2000. The move upset co-founder Abed, who was then also asked to resign, along with the three other founding employees of the company. A new CEO was hired and over the next ten years and several more rounds of financing, the company recovered and began to expand. Then . in April 2011 the company sold for $82.5 million to Verisk Health Inc. Mr Carsanaro thought . his payday had arrived and that he would become an instant millionaire. Mark Zuckerberg: The Facebook founder made $2.3bn in a year thanks to various stock options in the company . Instant millionaire: Instagram co-founder and CEO Kevin Systrom sold his firm to Facebook for $300m and 23 million shares . Cheated: Despite the company selling for $84m, the five founders of Bloodhound Technologies split $36,000 between them. One founder of the company received just $99 . But investors were paid first - before any of the founders and employees. Eventually there was just $36,000 left in the pot to split between the five founders. One received just $99. Bloodhound, formed in the mid-1990s, provides companies with fraud-monitoring software for health care claims . The founders filed suit, claiming that during several rounds of financing following their departure from the company, investors had schemed to dilute their collective holdings to less than 1 percent - without their knowledge - before selling the company. In the end, Carsonaro received $29,266, Kiamtia received $4,967, Taylor received $993, Abed got $397 and Seib was left with $99. The story is typical of the world of venture capital which can be a difficult and murky one to grasp. Founders . and employees can be hit in a brutal manner with majority of the cash . from any sale going to venture capitalists and holders of preferred . shares. A recent study, by . Profs. Brian J. Broughman and Jesse M. Fried, concluded in almost 50 . per cent of cases, investors were entitled to nothing - even when the . company was sold for tens of millions of dollars. Good negotiator: Naveen Selvadurai, co-founder of foursquare and has an estimated net worth of $80 million dollars . Lessons: A word of warning to budding entrepreneurs - negotiate your rights and payoff from the company at the very start . Some 20 per cent to 30 per cent of companies fail, returning nothing to any investor, so when venture capitalists risk supporting a startup they take their share before anyone else. There is one trick to bare in mind, and that is to negotiate greater control rights. Before being blinded by dollar signs, the crucial element is to ensure seats on the board or to insist in having a say in decisions such as if and when the company is sold in the years to come. Professors Broughman and Fried found in . their study that on average, such foresight saw founders receiving . around $3.7 million more during any sale or takeover. Whatta deal: Sacked Groupon CEO Andrew Mason was sacked and received $376.36 in severance pay, but he still owns $213 million in company shares . Tweeter: Jack Dorsey, the co-founder of Twitter, Jack Dorsey has a net worth of $1 billion . For Bloodhound Technologies, eight years had passed since the original founders had been in the chair. It meant all new negotiations for cash investment had been carried out on the terms of the venture capitalists. The five former colleagues are now suing in a Delaware court which, if a jury rules in their favor, the Times points out that it could change the way companies operate in future when it comes to balancing the payouts of founders and employees to the rewards that venture capitalists expect.","Bloodhound technologies formed in the mid-1990s .

"No matter how highly you rate the catalytic impact of Jurgen Klinsmann on Germany’s international football or the complementary consistence of vision and patience of Joachim Low, it’s essential to view Matthias Sammer’s hungry, aggressive, visionary and ambitious impact while technical director as fundamental. The cumulative process of their work took a decade to reach fruition and was, admittedly, fuelled by root and branch change across Germany’s club and administrative networks. Yet from the lowest points of their mannschaft’s decline (Group Stage elimination at Euro 2004) to achieving third and second-place finishes at World Cup 2006 and then Euro 2008, the time lapses were two and four years respectively. New era: Conte congratulates his players after a successful friendly against World Cup semi-finalists Holland . Shocked: Italy crashed out of the World Cup, along with England, after losing to Costa Rica . The right people, the right talent and the right attitudes can galvanize even a moribund situation. Quickly. Coincidentally, the two biggest early setbacks the German renaissance suffered were being hammered 4-1 by Italy in March 2006 and then losing an epic World Cup semi-final to the Azzurri in Dortmund later that year. How time flies. Champions that tournament, the Italians were then first-round, eight-stone weaklings in each of the next two World Cups. For that reason, they are now in the hands of a man who unites one or two of the qualities of each of those three Germans who, between them, hauled their national team up by the scruff of the neck to produce finishes of: third; second; third equal and first from 2006-2014. Like ‘Klinsi’, Antonio Conte is quite prepared to swim against the tide in terms of what it feels the entire nation believes or assumes. His drive for reform, rejuvenation is zealous. Revolution: Matthias Sammer was crucial in driving Germany to change after Euro 2004 . Low point: Milan Baros scores to knock Germany out of Euro 2004 in the Group stage . Final chapter: Ten years after their Portuguese disaster Joachim Low had led Germany to the World Cup . Like Low, who used his total admiration for the Spanish football school to draw inspiration for a definitive vision of how Germany should play, the 45-year-old Italian possesses a crystal-clear notion of how he wants the Azzurri to attack, defend, press, use width and to adopt a new level of dedication to winning. But Conte most resembles Sammer. Not, before you splutter toast crumbs into your Sunday morning cuppa, as a footballer. Ironically enough the German was a Ferrari of a player while the Italian... a humble but redoubtable Volkswagen Beetle. ‘I realised from the start of my Juventus career I’d have to work twice as hard as my team-mates to survive at that club,’ is his candid admission of the technical gap between himself and the majority of Marcelo Lippi’s squad. ‘But, a coach? I always knew I could become a good coach. It’s my vocation. I’m made to show a direction, to add method, to create a squad. To take decisions.’ What he most shares with Sammer now is a defiant belief that hard work, aggression, cracking the whip to get more out of everyone around him, vision, philosophy and a nuclear level of personal drive can achieve anything. Literally anything. Prior to Thursday’s 2-0 victory over Guus Hiddink’s Holland in Bari (in front of a remarkable crowd of 50,000) there were signs that Conte was going to apply very literally the advice of one of the two great coaching figures in his illustrious career — Lippi. The great man counselled him: ‘In the Federation, they really want a guy to shake up the environment — it’s the key task now. 'All great coaches aim to take over the national team one day and my advice is: “Don’t even change one jot of the attitude which gave you such incredible results at Juve. Be just the same man with the national team as you were with the club”.’ Evidence? Mario Balotelli dropped, Gigi Buffon left on the bench against Holland so that Salvatore ‘my horse is like a member of the family’ Sirigu could keep goal. More? Pizzas and bread are suddenly banned around the Azzurri training camp, with Conte’s players now being asked to eat six times a day when on national team duty. Breakfast, mid-training snack, lunch, mid-afternoon snack, light dinner then a late-night supper — all aimed at achieving what they term ‘glycemic calm’. Whether this can positively affect his stars when they only gather with the national team a handful of times per season and then eat either at their own discretion or under club rules the rest of the time is debatable. Big call: Conte dropped veteran keeper Gianluigi Buffon for the Holland game on Thursday night . Replacement: Salvator Sirigu was preferred to Buffon on Thursday and could keep his place against Norway . Dropped: Mario Balotelli was not included in Conte's squad and will have to work hard to return for Italy . Motivation: Conte has a philosophy of hard work . Conte knows it but his attitude is: ‘My way is the only way and it will be enforced here. If you don’t like it, don’t turn up.’ It is, already, the hour for young bucks like Alessandro Florenzi, Ciro Immobile, Mattia de Sciglio, Mattia Destro, Simone Zaza and Stephan El Shaarawy to show that this is their era. Starting against Norway on Tuesday. Some of the Conte impact is already totally evident. He defines himself thus: ‘Football is an obsession. I get home and put the TV on to watch it. Apart from football, I read. I read stories of great men. Of those who have written pages of history. I need to expand my wealth of knowledge.’ Notwithstanding the fine rhetoric, reaching out for greatness often implies ruthlessness. The end, if successful, is praised. However the means aren’t always regarded as justifiable while being applied. Klinsmann was derided as a new-age pseudo-Yankee. Low criticised for being too pseudo-Spanish, not ruthlessly German enough. Sammer’s brash, outspoken nature puts hackles up. Conte quit Juventus after pre- season had just begun. The club were infuriated. There are wounds. However, there are also underlying themes. He’d previously warned of his feelings on elimination from the Champions League in 2013, saying: ‘Right now, Italian club football isn’t competitive at the top level of Europe. I’m sorry to have to say it but it’s true. ‘People can either face the truth or bury their heads but I’m going to push on and try to change it. Some will try to avoid reality and say that in two or three years then Milan or Napoli or Inter or Juve can win the Champions League. But when was the last time Italian clubs were reaching European finals? ‘What we need is intelligence, clear debate and work, work, work. We need that so players, coaches, experts, media, ex-players, administrators... everyone, unites to try to make our game grow. ‘But, I’m sad, we’ve simply been interested in “polemic” in Italy in recent years. What a referee says or does, who a player is going out with, that type of rubbish. Trivia instead of serious matters. And so nothing gets done.’ Until now.","Like Matthias Sammer in Germany, Conte can turn Italian football around .

"Joan Rivers' daughter released a statement this morning confirming that the comedian is on life support - despite claims by the comedian’s friends that she was slowly recovering. ‘On behalf of my mother and our family, we are extremely grateful for all the love and support we've received. At this time she does remain on life support,’ Melissa Rivers stated. ‘I know my mother would be overwhelmed by the continued outpouring of kindness and I want to thank everyone for keeping us in their prayers.’ Scroll down for video . Just hours before the throat operation that has . left her in a medically-induced coma, comedian Joan Rivers was laughing . about 'going in for a little procedure', close friend Jay Redack, left, . has revealed . The statement appears to contradict claims made by the 81-year-old comedians' friends, who said that Rivers was on the road to recovery. Joan . Rivers is making slow and steady progress in her recovery as doctors . continue the delicate task of waking her from a medically induced coma . this week. The . 81-year-old comedian stopped breathing during minor throat surgery on . Thursday in New York City and was left battling for her life over the . weekend amid fears the entertainer might be left a 'vegetable' or . needing a 'wheelchair'. However, . friends have dismissed these claims and said that Rivers is improving . day by day at Mount Sinai Hospital with her daughter, Melissa Rivers, at . her bedside. 'It's a slow process, but she's on the road to recovery,' said a source to E! 'She's getting better. Don't believe all this ridiculous speculation.' Daughter, Melissa, who rushed across the country from LA to New York on Thursday has focused all her attention onto her mother's recovery. 'She is a rock. She is calmer than I've ever seen her,' the source said to E! News. 'All these reports about doomsday are not true. She is her mother's daughter and she's tough as nails. She's the person keeping everyone together.' This comes after it was reported Rivers was laughing about 'going in for a little procedure' before she suffered cardiac and respiratory arrest during her operation at an Upper East Side Clinic. Margie Stern and daughter Ricki Stern seen visited Joan Rivers at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan on Sunday . Doctors on Sunday started the delicate process to bring the comedian out of a medically induced coma which will take until Tuesday. Doctors fear the stroke could have left her 'as a vegetable' or 'needing a wheelchair'. Earlier . on Sunday her close friend and collaborator for 40 years Jay Redack had . attempted to visit her in hospital, but was turned away by security. He . was one of the last people to spent time with Rivers. The old friends . had enjoyed dinner on Wednesday night after her hour-long stand-up . session at the Laurie Beechman Theatre in Times Square. ‘She . said her throat was bothering her for a long time. Her voice was . getting more raspy, if that was possible. She said she was just going in . for a little procedure in the morning, that was it,’ he told the Daily News. Redack described Rivers as 'up and alive and having a ton of fun' at dinner. 'We laughed out asses off,' he said. Daughter .

She said, ""I'll think about it,'"" he said. Other friends to have visited the hospital included Margie Stern, one of Rivers' closest friends. Rivers' family are said to be . considering bringing a lawsuit after she suddenly stopped breathing . during the 'botched' procedure. 'Shock and upset is turning to anger, and they are looking for someone to blame,' a source close to the family told the Daily News. 'An 81-year-old should not have that procedure as an outpatient.' New York Police Department has said that it is not yet looking at launching an investigation into the clinic's actions. Daughter Melissa, 46, released a statement on Sunday thanking everyone for their . messages of support and gave a brief update on her mother's condition.

While . doctors were said to be keen to keep her in a coma until the weekend, . there is concern about the length of time her brain was starved of . oxygen. But . less than 12 hours before she stopped breathing, Rivers was her usual . irrepressible self, making jokes about her own longevity and mortality . to an audience of around 100. 'She did a joke onstage, she goes, ‘I’m 81 — I could go at any moment,’ said Shade Rupe, 45. ‘I could fall over right here and you all could say, ''I was there!’ Rupe, who spoke to the New York Daily News, said that Rivers' comedy was as quick-witted as it has always been. 'She . was so on,' he said. 'If you had me guess her age, I’d say she was in . her 50s. She didn’t miss a step, she didn’t go ditzy, she didn’t forget . anything and her timing was amazing.' Rupe grabbed a picture with the star outside the theater and said that Rivers 'looked fantastic.' And, . as testament to the television host's vigor, Rivers was even promoting . her book, Diary of a Mad Diva, before she took to the stage on . Wednesday. Rivers, . who has been a fixture on American television since the mid-1960s, was . her forthright self according to those who were at the press meet. When . she walked in to take her seat, said Shira Blum, an online project . manager, 'She seemed totally healthy. She was very . energetic, hilarious, funny. And it was such a shock, a surprise to hear . the news this morning.' Rivers took questions and said she wakes up every morning and 'is thankful that everything works,' Blum added.","Melissa Rivers released a statement saying her mother does remain on life support 'at this time'

"Jailed: Rhiannon Brooker, 30, has been jailed for three and a half years after she falsely accused her boyfriend of rape so she would have an excuse for failing her legal exams . A lying law graduate has been labelled 'utterly wicked' after she falsely accused her boyfriend of rape so she would have an excuse for failing her legal exams. Rhiannon Brooker, 30, has been jailed for three and a half years after she was found guilty of perverting the course of justice by claiming Paul Fensome, 46, forced her to have sex with him on five occasions. The Birmingham law graduate even faked injuries to suggest Mr Fensome had beaten her, and alleged that he caused her to have a miscarriage by punching her in the stomach. Bristol Crown Court heard that Brooker falsified the allegations because her party lifestyle led her to fail her bar assessments. She repeatedly told an exam committee that her performance suffered from 'extenuating circumstances'. Mr Fensome, a 6ft 8in heavy metal fan, was arrested, charged and held in custody for 36 days before police realised he had clear alibis for the dates of the alleged rapes. Brooker, of Frampton Cotterell, South Gloucestershire, denied 20 charges of perverting the course of justice between May 2011 and January 2012. But a jury of 10 men and two women convicted her of 12 charges - five false rape claims, six assaults and one of false imprisonment - earlier this month. Jurors were discharged after failing to reach verdicts on the eight remaining charges. Judge Julian Lambert said Brooker, who did not wish to be present in court as the sentence was passed, had lied in an 'utterly wicked' way. 'Rhiannon Brooker was a bright star and shining example of what can be achieved by those who lack special privileges,' the judge said. 'All that went terribly wrong with tragic consequences when she began to lie. These lies had a terrible, corrosive effect. The effect was like ripples spreading through a pool of sadness. 'The effect continues today. Rhiannon Brooker lied and lied and lied again and was relentless in her attempts to mislead.' Judge Lambert said Brooker began to circulate false stories about being sexually abused by Mr Fensome in 2011. Scroll down for video . Victim: Mr Fensome, a 6ft 8in heavy metal fan, was arrested, charged and held in custody for 36 days before police realised he had clear alibis for the dates of the alleged rapes . Her lies led to Mr Fensome’s arrest, . charge and detention in Horfield Prison, where he was subjected to abuse . by fellow inmates. 'She does bear the ultimate responsibility for circulating then doggedly pursuing false rape allegations,' the judge said. 'Prison . is a terrible humiliation and degradation, particularly for a person of . previous good character. The irony is that is what she inflicted on her . former partner.' Judge . Lambert said he had sat through 'hour after hour' of video interviews in . which Brooker told officers how she had been raped, during the . eight-week trial. 'What I . observed was someone of high intelligence who went to significant . devious lengths to pervert the course of public justice,' he said. 'The conduct was utterly cynical, calculating, determined and repeated.' Judge . Lambert said two people suffered 'dreadfully' as a consequence of . Brooker’s actions - Mr Fensome and Brooker’s nine-month-old baby, who . cannot be named for legal reasons. Fake: Bristol Crown Court heard that Brooker falsified the allegations because her party lifestyle led her to fail her bar assessments . 'What the defendant did here was cold, calculated, sustained, repeated and under any analysis utterly wicked,' he added. Judge Lambert sentenced Brooker to three and a half years for each of the five false rape allegations, to run concurrently. He imposed nine-month sentences for . the remaining six false assault allegations and one charge of false . imprisonment, also to run concurrently. Prosecutor . David Bartlett had told the court that Brooker’s actions could have . resulted in Mr Fensome, an innocent man, receiving a substantial prison . sentence. 'There can be no doubt that if Mr . Fensome was convicted of five rapes, six assaults and one false . imprisonment, he would have faced a very long term of imprisonment, . measured in double figures,' Mr Bartlett said. 'Despite his good character, a sentence of life imprisonment would have been considered.' 'Prison is a terrible humiliation and . degradation, particularly for a person of previous good character. The . irony is that is what she inflicted on her former partner.' Judge Julian Lambert . Mr . Bartlett said Brooker submitted a statement containing the false . allegations to her tutor at the University of West of England on April . 11 2011. Police were called and began their investigation on May 24 that year, with Mr Fensome arrested on August 1. Brooker . continued her lies in interviews with police between August 2 and . August 22 and further interviews in November that year. Mr . Fensome spent 36 days in custody, after which he was subjected to an . electronic tag and curfew and had to report to police by phone call six . times per day. In January 2012, prosecutors offered no evidence against Mr Fensome as phone records and work rosters from his railway signalman job proved he could not have committed the attacks. Mr Bartlett said Brooker even used a secret second phone to send abusive messages to herself - then pretended they were from Mr Fensome. 'Miss Brooker has shown no remorse,' Mr Bartlett said. In a victim impact statement, Mr Fensome, who has since received £38,000 in compensation from Avon and Somerset Police, said: 'My life has been turned upside-down and ripped apart. My family and I have been put through an immense amount of stress and heartache, which continues to the present day. 'We cannot come to terms with why we have been put through this. If I had not been able to prove my whereabouts, I could have been locked away for something that I had not done which would have lost me my career, my home - everything I have worked so hard for. 'Please be assured I have the utmost sympathy for anyone who has been through a genuine attack but I also feel strongly that false claims must be dealt with strongly to send the message that such acts will not be tolerated.'","Rhiannon Brooker claimed Paul Fensome forced her to have sex with him .

"Husband-to-be: Thomas Williams, the onetime public face of the Legion of Christ, is getting married Saturday to the mother of his love child . The former public face of the discredited Legion of Christ order who left the priesthood after fathering a love child is getting married this weekend to his son’s mother. Former clergyman Thomas Williams will walk down the aisle with the daughter of former U.S. Ambassador to the Holy See Mary Ann Glendon - one of Pope Francis' top advisers. Glendon, a Harvard University law professor, is one of the highest-ranking women at the Vatican as president of the Pontifical Academy for Social Sciences. She is also one of five people on Francis’ commission to reform the scandal-marred Vatican bank. Her daughter, Elizabeth Lev, is a well-regarded art historian and columnist for the Legion-run Zenit news agency, which Williams published for over a decade while he was in the order. Williams, a moral theologian, author, lecturer and U.S. television personality, admitted last year that he had fathered a child several years earlier. At the time, Williams apologized for ‘this grave transgression’ against his vows of celibacy and said he had stayed on as a priest because he hoped to move beyond ‘this sin in my past’ to do good work for the church. Happy couple: Williams (left) resigned the priesthood last year after admitting the he fathered a son several years ago with art historian Elizabeth Lev, pictured right with the boy . Friends in high places: Lev is the daughter of former U.S. Ambassador to the Holy See Mary Ann Glendon, pictured here in 2008 with then-Pope Benedict XVI . The Legion’s retired superior later admitted he had learned about the child in 2005 but allowed Williams to keep teaching and preaching about morality. After taking a year off for reflection, Williams left the priesthood in May to care for his son, who suffers from Down syndrome. According to their wedding registry, he and Lev are due to marry Saturday in the U.S. Trailblazer: Glendon (left), pictured in Rome with her daughter, is currently one of the highest-ranking women at the Vatican as president of the Pontifical Academy for Social Sciences . Lev is an American-born art historian who has lived and worked in Rome since 1997. She has two other children from past relationships. She had initially denied an affair with Williams, though they frequently were seen together in American expatriate circles in Rome, particularly with visiting U.S. student and Catholic tour groups. The couple's wedding announcement coincides with a revelation made by the Legion, which admitted Thursday that a superior who was in charge of the bulk of its American priests-in-training for over a decade sexually abused a minor at the Legion’s novitiate in Cheshire, Connecticut. The Legion said a second accuser had also come forward with an allegation against the Rev. William Izquierdo, who was novice director at the Cheshire school from 1982-1994 and in Ireland before then. Izquierdo, now 85, has dementia. The Rev. Marcial Maciel founded the cult-like Legion in 1941 in Mexico and oversaw its growth into a large and prominent congregation despite credible reports that he was a drug addict and child molester. After Maciel’s death in 2008, the Legion admitted that he fathered three children and sexually abused his seminarians. In 2010, the Vatican took over the . order and a papal delegate has been overseeing a reform and . ‘purification.’ In January, the Legion will elect a new leadership and . approve a new set of constitutions. The . Legion scandal has been particularly damaging to the Vatican because . Maciel was held up by Pope John Paul II and his cardinals as a model for . the faithful, with the order admired for its orthodoxy and ability to . bring in money and new priests. Like . all Legion priests, Williams had been a staunch defender of Maciel. When Maciel’s double life became public in 2009, Williams told the . Catholic ETWN program that the revelations were a ‘very, very hard blow . to all of us.’ Until he . left active ministry, Williams was the most publicly prominent priest in . the 950-strong order. He is the author of such books as 2008’s ‘Knowing . Right From Wrong: A Christian Guide to Conscience,’ and was a . commentator for the U.S. broadcaster CBS. Matriarch: Lev has two older daughters and a young son fathered by Williams, who suffers from Down syndrome . In good company: Lev, center, is pictured with director Ron Howard (right) and his film crew during the shooting of 'Angels and Demons' in Rome . He was the superior of the Legion’s general directorate in Rome in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The Legion’s revelation about a senior cleric having abused a novitiate was contained in a report on the steps the Legion has taken to address sexually abusive clergy within its ranks and respond to the victims of Maciel. According to the report by the Legion’s superior, the Rev. Sylvester Heerman, 35 priests have been accused of sexually abusing minors; nine were found guilty and 14 were acquitted in a church trial. Two had left the priesthood when the allegations were made, so no church sanctions could be imposed, and 10 cases are still under review. In addition, two Legion superiors were found guilty of sexually abusing adults under their case and three were acquitted. The Legion said the numbers indicate that less than 1 per cent of the 1,133 priests ordained in the 72-year history of the order had been found guilty by a church trial of abuse, and less than 4 per cent had been abused.","Thomas Williams was the public face of Legion of Christ religious order until his resignation last year .

"A federal judge rejected a Montana woman's request on Friday to dismiss her murder indictment for pushing her newlywed husband off a Montana cliff during an argument in Glacier National Park. Jordan Graham testified earlier in the hearing that she instinctively pushed Cody Johnson away when he grabbed her arm, causing the July 7 fall. She also alleged that an FBI agent improperly interviewed her and made her uncomfortable by touching her knee. Murder charge: Jordan Graham with her husband, Cody Johnson, who she is accused of killing . District Judge Donald Molloy rejected Graham's motion to dismiss the indictment or at least the first-degree murder charge. The judge dismissed another motion by prosecutors who sought a delay in the December 9 trial while they awaited the results of DNA tests on a piece of cloth found near Johnson's body. Graham, 22, and Johnson, 25, had been married for eight days when they argued over her doubts about the marriage, prosecutors said. The couple took the argument to Glacier National Park, where Johnson at one point grabbed Graham, and Graham removed his arm and pushed him in the back and off a steep cliff, according to the criminal complaint. She is charged with first-degree murder, second-degree murder and making a false statement to authorities. Graham has pleaded not guilty, and said she was only attempting to remove Johnson's arm - not push him off the cliff. Accused: Jordan Linn Graham, center, leaves the courthouse after pleading not guilty to charges last month . She repeated the claim on the stand on Friday that she was acting instinctively. She added that she felt uncomfortable in a July 16 interview with FBI Agent Stacey Smiedala, during which she dropped her previous claims that Johnson had driven off with friends. Graham's attorney Michael Donahoe alleged in court filings that Agent Smiedala interrogated his client alone and unrecorded for nearly one and a half hours so that he could 'shape' her statement to get Graham to admit she acted not instinctively, but in the 'heat of passion', required to file manslaughter charges. During that time, Agent Smiedala allegedly made her uncomfortable by sitting very close and touching her knee for extended periods of time, Graham testified. A shorter statement of Graham's version of events was then recorded and the agent 'told me that I was in the clear, that I wouldn't be seeing him again, and that I was free to go', she said. Wedding day: Graham had told a friend she was going to talk to her husband about having 'second thoughts'. They are pictured, right, on the day of their wedding - just eight days before he fell to his death . Victim: Cody Johnson's body was found at the bottom of a cliff in the Glacier National Park . Her recorded statements were later distorted in the criminal complaint, Mr Donahoe alleged. Assistant . U.S. Attorney Zeno Baucus said in court filings that Graham . participated voluntarily, and that FBI agents conducted the interview . and filed the complaint properly. Judge . Molloy ordered prosecutors to review Agent Smiedala's employment . records and disclose privately to the judge any evidence about his . capacity for truthfulness, any disciplinary records or complaints and . any special interrogation training he received.","Jordan Graham accused of murdering husband Cody Johnson in July .

"Chic in a tailored cream jacket and a neat black dress, Spain's Queen Letizia was every inch the royal style icon as she arrived for her husband King Felipe's speech at the UN today. But for once, she had serious competition, which came in the shape of the Netherlands' equally glamorous Queen Maxima. The two were in New York for the 69th session of the UN General Assembly, which includes a debate in which both King Felipe and King Willem-Alexander are due to speak. So which is your favourite palace? The royal pair compare notes as they chat with another delegate at the UN . With no speech of their own to make, the two sat together and chatted as they waited for proceedings to begin and, at one point, burst into laughter. It was all a far cry from the serious business on Monday, when the Spanish Queen and her husband spent the day meeting scientists living and working in New York. But with Felipe due to make a big speech putting the case for his country's inclusion in the UN Security Council, Letizia and Maxima soon sobered up and watched intently as the debate began. Both Maxima, 43, and Letizia, 42, are relatively new to their thrones, with the Spanish Queen ascending to the throne in June and her Dutch counterpart a year earlier. Lots in common: Both Letizia and Maxima are relative newcomers to the business of monarchy . Serious business: Their husbands, King Felipe and King Willem-Alexander, were both due to make speeches . Paying attention: The royal pair listen as the speech-making gets underway at the General Assembly meeting . Hard at work:  King Felipe and Queen Letizia spent Monday meeting Spanish scientists working in the Big Apple . Like the Duchess of Cambridge, both are mothers to young children and have taken a keen interest in children's charities since being handed the top job. But while Letizia's reign has so far gone smoothly, Maxima and her husband have had a rougher ride in recent months thanks to the MH17 tragedy, which left the Netherlands reeling. Nevertheless, the popularity of the Argentina-born Dutch Queen has soared thanks to her tireless work on behalf of the MH17 families. She has also attended some of the repatriation ceremonies and was seen sobbing from her perch beside Prime Minister Mark Rutte as the first flight arrived back on Dutch soil. Traditional: Maxima, looking glamorous in crimson, arrives for King Willem-Alexander's Prinsjesdag speech . Glamorous: A crimson-clad Queen Maxima and her husband King Willem-Alexander were cheered last week . Despite the  tragedy, the Dutch royal couple were cheered to the rafters when they appeared on the balcony of the Noordeinde Palace in the Hague on Prinsjesdag, along with former Queen Beatrix, 76. Letizia too has become increasingly popular since ascending to the throne in June, making regular appearances in support of children's and disability charities, as well as on the arm of husband King Felipe, 46. Most recently, Letizia found herself on the receiving end of a slew of positive headlines after stopping to greet a wheelchair-bound well-wisher who had travelled to the Spanish city of San Sebastien to meet her. Her hair whipping around her shoulders, Letizia ignored the unseasonably miserable weather as she bent down to chat to the elderly lady. The engagement, which took place days before she and King Felipe travelled to New York, was part of an unusually intense September schedule which looks set to be replicated over the coming month.

"Though a jury found Eric McGowen guilty of horrifically gang-raping an 11-year-old girl, two major issues remain in the search for justice. One, McGowen, 20, hasn’t been seen since he vanished during a break in proceedings last week, and the Liberty County Sheriff’s Office had few leads to his whereabouts. In the case, 20 men and boys were charged with repeatedly attacking the girl over the span of five months, through December of 2010. Second, the small Texas community of Cleveland remains divided on the rape – some residents have suggested the girl was partly responsible because of her appearance, sparking widespread condemnation. McGowen, pictured prior to his escape, is among 14 adults accused of raping the girl in the shocking series of attacks that took place in the small Texas community of Cleveland . Some also believe the arrests were . racially motivated; all of the suspects are black, while the girl is . Hispanic. The crime has created a still-lingering divide among . residents. And with the first suspect convicted . in the case at large and several more defendants still facing trial, it . could be some time before Cleveland, about 45 miles outside of Houston, . is able to put the crime behind it. Prosecutors say the girl was sexually . assaulted on at least five occasions from mid-September through early . December of 2010, at the mobile home and elsewhere. Others, however, . anxiously await the capture of the first person tried and convicted in . the case who ran off in the middle of his trial. 'She was just 11,' Charles Armstrong . told the Associated Press, as he watched his three and four year old . grandsons play in his front yard across the street from where the mobile . home once stood. 'I'm not going to stand behind them . (the defendants). I'm going to stand behind a jury,' said Armstrong, . sitting in a plastic chair outside his mobile home following an . overnight shift at his maintenance job at Wal-Mart. Despite evidence at Eric McGowen's . trial that included a confession, DNA evidence, the girl's tearful . testimony and a video of her being assaulted, others haven't been . swayed. Caroline King, who lives down the . street, insisted Friday that people still 'don't know the facts of the . case' and said authorities were just 'harassing people' by knocking on . doors in the town of about 7,700 people as they searched for McGowen. 'It's not as bad as what they are saying. Nobody tied (the girl) up,' said King, 59. Liberty County Courthouse: McGowen's trial went on without him and a jury convicted him of aggravated sexual assault of a child . Some suggested early on that the girl . was partly responsible because they say she wore makeup, looked older . than her age and wasn't properly supervised by her parents. But Comeka Robinson, who knows . McGowen, described the girl as a 'baby.' She said what happened to the . girl was wrong, but she also has doubts about the guilt of McGowen and . some of the others charged. 'I would not recommend (he) turn himself in,' Robinson, 25, said. McGowen, who had been out on bail, . fled Wednesday after the girl testified that he sexually assaulted her . multiple times, including once with a beer bottle. The trial went on . without him, and jurors found him guilty of aggravated sexual assault of . a child and then sentenced McGowen to 99 years in prison. It's unclear if divisions in the town . may be complicating efforts to find McGowen. Authorities are saying . little about the search. Crime scene: Authorities say this is the abandoned trailer where an 11-year-old girl was sexually assaulted in November 2010 in the town of Cleveland, Texas . Dirty: The attacks occurred inside an abandoned mobile home, pictured, where the victim was assaulted by as many as 20 men . Interim police Chief Darrel Broussard said his . agency was working with the Liberty County Sheriff's Office to try to . find McGowen, including checking places he previously lived in . Cleveland. The mayor did not return a message Friday seeking comment about the case. McGowen was the first defendant to . stand trial in the case. All six of the juveniles and two of the 14 . adults charged pleaded guilty. Trial dates have not been set for the 11 . remaining defendants. Police began investigating after one . of the girl's classmates told a teacher he saw video of her being . sexually assaulted in the abandoned trailer. Kim Shelton, a member of the Unity . Committee in Cleveland, which was created several years ago to promote . the city, said the community is working to deal with the crime and . trying to ensure something like that never happens again. Recently, a local church sponsored a . conference to teach girls to respect themselves, for example. Shelton . also believes parents are talking more to their children. Earlier this summer, Shelton's . committee began selling bumper stickers that say 'I (Heart) Cleveland, . TX' as a way to promote the city and tell others it's a good place to . live. 'We consider ourselves family and we are moving forward,' she said. Accused: Kelvin Rashad King, left, and Devo Shaun Green, right, were among those accused of raping the girl .

"Nani has not spoken to Louis van Gaal since his loan move to Sporting Lisbon.

Nani also revealed to Sportsmail the reason behind his tearful celebration of last weekend's wonderstrike and failed to rule out a move to Everton when his stint at Sporting comes to an end.

Nani has revealed the reason behind his tearful celebration of last weekend's wonderstrike for Sporting . Nani celebrates with goalscorer Wayne Rooney on the opening day of the season before his move to Portugal . The Portugal international returned to his first club in August following Van Gaal's arrival at United. He capped a returned to form following a miserable campaign last year by thumping a sensational 30-yard volley against Gil Vicente but when asked if the Dutchman had contacted him to monitor his progress he said: 'No.' 'I receive some texts from Ed Woodward,' Nani added. 'He texted me about the goal and the great season I am having here.' It would appear that Van Gaal is not the only one to lose touch, with Nani admitting he now rarely speaks to his United teammates. 'I used to speak to Antonio Valencia but I changed my number so it's difficult,' he said. Nani rarely speaks to his Man United team-mates, including Antonio Valencia, after changing his number . The talented winger, pictured third left, signed a five-year contract extenstion with the club back in 2013 . Nani, who signed a five-year contract extension at Old Trafford in 2013, says he made the decision to leave United because he thought playing time would be limited under Van Gaal. 'I knew with the new manager it would be more difficult because of the new system and my position in it,' he explained. 'I knew it would be hard to play. I decided to go to Sporting because it was an opportunity to come home, feel comfortable, get games and feel strong again.' Nani decided to leave Man United because he thought playing time would be limited under Louis Van Gaal . He has done just that, although a video clip of him reduced to tears following Sunday's goal went viral. 'The game before against Wolfsburg I couldn't do my best,' he said. 'I ended the game wishing I could have done more. I prepared myself to do my best and after the goal I thanked God who helped me be my best.' Nani was emotional and dropped to the floor after scoring a stunnining 30-yard strike for Sporting on Sunday . Nani, pictured punching the air as his eyes started to fill up, says he thanked God for helping him play better . Nani admits he 'couldn't do his best' for the Portuguese side against Wolfsburg in the Europa League . Nani is expecting to return to United at the end of his loan spell but admitted his future, with Everton known admirers, was uncertain. 'At the moment I just focus on my job here,' he said. 'I'll do my best and get in the best condition I can, then come back as strong as possible and see what the manager or the club want from me. 'I love Man United. I love the club. The only decision I made to go away was to play more and be me again because I lost a lot of things there last season because of injuries and the change of the manager. The new manager didn't know me well and a lot of things changed. I needed to play regularly to be happy. 'You never know the future. It depends on a lot of things. If Man United want me to stay then, with different mentality I think we can work well next season but it's a lot of things to discuss and see.' Nani revealed 'lots of things changed' for him last season after David Moyes took over at Old Trafford . Nani is greeted by Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho when Sporting faced the Blues in the Champions League . Nani, speaking on behalf of BT Sport ahead of Porto v Sporting which is live on ESPN this Sunday, is not surprised that United have struggled to adapt to life under Van Gaal but added that he thinks they will qualify for the Champions League. 'It's normal when a lot of things change,' he said. 'The results are always different. We know it is just a moment and everything will be OK. We'll be the number one of England again.' United have been linked with a move for Nani's Sporting teammate, William Carvalho. And he thinks the tough tackling defensive midfielder would be a hit at Old Trafford. 'He is a great player,' said Nani. 'He has a lot of quality. I think at the end of this season he will be prepared to play in the Premier League. I think if Manchester United are interested it's a good chance.' William Carvalho, previously linked with a move to Man United, is a great player according to compatriot Nani . BT Sport brings fans multiple live games from Portugal’s Primeira Liga every week as part of a continental European football line-up including UEFA Europa League, Germany’s Bundesliga, France’s Ligue 1 and Italy’s Serie A, alongside top-flight British football from the Barclays Premier League and the FA Cup.","Man United winger Nani joined Sporting Lisbon a season-long loan deal .

"Men born abroad have been more likely to hold down a job since the financial crisis than those born in Britain, an international think-tank has found. Despite a drop in overall employment during the economic downturn, male migrants in the UK have had higher levels of employment than ‘native-born men’. Before 2007, foreign men were less likely to be in a job than those born in this country. The OECD's International Migration Outlook 2013 has shown how foreign-born men have had higher levels of employment than British-born workers since 2007 . While British workers have seen employment rates fall since 2001, male migrants workers have seen an increase in the number in work (file picture) But analysis by the Organisation for . Economic Co-operation and Development, which represents the world’s . leading industrialised nations, has found that since then foreign-born . workers have been better at keeping their jobs. Critics of immigration policies say the report shows Britons have not benefited from economic growth over previous years. But others say migrants are, in many cases, simply more hard-working. The OECD study found that in 2006, . before the economic crisis, 76.9 per cent of British-born men were in a . job – ahead of 76.3 per cent of those born abroad. But by 2008, the figures had flipped, . with a 76.8 per cent employment rate for British-born men compared with . 77.8 per cent for those born abroad. The report suggests 'foreign-born' men have reversed a pre-crisis shortfall and are now doing better than men who were born in the country. File picture shows migrants workers in a field at a farm in Lincolnshire . The 2012 figures show the gap is now . even wider with 74.3 per cent employment for men born in the UK compared . with 76.9 per cent for foreign-born men. For women, however, those born in the UK are still more likely to be in employment than those born elsewhere. Sir Andrew Green, chairman of . MigrationWatch UK, said: ‘It is time for the thorough assessment of the . impact of immigration on the employment of British workers that this . report only touches on.’ The unemployment rate now stands at 7.8 per cent, according to the latest figures from the ONS . The findings feature in the . Paris-based think-tank’s International Migration Outlook report for . 2013, which also reveals that in 2011 total permanent immigration rose . in 34 OECD countries, from 2010. The report also found the UK and . Germany are the biggest recipients of migrants from areas most affected . by the financial crisis, particularly southern Europe, with numbers . almost doubling in recent years. It concluded the take-up of benefits . by immigrants relative to native-born households in the UK is lower than . the average in OECD countries. Don Flynn, director of Migrants’ Rights Network, said: ‘With a high level of male migrant participation . rates in economic activity and an upward trend in earning levels the . evidence shows migration is a dynamic and positive feature of modern . economies and ought to be acknowledged as such.’ The latest figures from the Office . for National Statistics show the total number of people unemployed . between February and April 2013 was 2.51 million. The OECD report suggests while the . employment rates of British-born men has fallen from 78.14 per cent in . 2001 to 74.73 per cent in 2012, male migrant workers have seen an . increase from 72.3 per cent to 76.9 per cent. While the UK has seen a drop overall in employment since the financial crisis, male migrants have had higher levels than 'native-born' men (file picture) A Home Office spokesman said half of those UK residents who were foreign-born, as defined in the report, were now British citizens. She said: 'The official figures show that the recent rise in employment has benefited British citizens first but that we continue attracting skilled migrants to the UK where they are needed by British businesses. 'We are building an immigration system that works in the national interest and is supporting growth. 'Our reforms are working, and they are having an impact in all the right places. We have tightened immigration routes where abuse was rife and net migration is down by almost a third as a result. 'We will continue to work hard to ensure that net migration is reduced from the hundreds of thousands to the tens of thousands by the end of this Parliament.' The report also found that the UK and Germany are the biggest recipients of migrants fleeing countries most affected by the financial crisis, particular in southern Europe, with numbers almost doubling in recent years. It added that outflows of nationals from these countries are speeding up, with movements having risen by 45 per cent from 2009 to 2011 and early data suggests this increase is continuing. Dr Carlos Vargas-Silva, senior researcher at the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, said: 'The OECD data on labour markets make very interesting reading. 'It is important to recognise that migrants are not one homogenous group, and that different sorts of migrants have been affected differently by the economic downturn. The report found that the UK and Germany were the biggest recipients of migrants fleeing countries most affected by the financial crisis (file picture) 'Two things stand out, the first is that there is a big gender difference - foreign-born men have seen less of a decline in their employment rate than UK born men between 2008 and 2012, but the employment rate of foreign-born women has seen a bigger decline than that of UK-born women in the same period.' Looking at Romania and Bulgaria, which will see access restrictions to the UK labour market lifted at the end of this year, the report draws a number of conclusions. In Romania, the OECD said migration data is limited with officially registered emigration likely to capture only a small fraction of outflows. This is significant because there has . been a prolonged debate in the UK over providing estimates of the . numbers of Romanians likely to arrive in the UK next year. 'It is time for a thorough assessment of . the impact of immigration on the employment of British workers that . this report only touches on' - Sir Andrew Green, chairman of campaign group Migration Watch UK . The UK Government has so far refused to provide official estimates as ministers believe they would not be reliable. Earlier this week the Daily Mail reported how Britain was the first choice for young Romanians who want to work abroad. Research revealed a quarter of the population aged between 18 and 35 would choose a job in the UK when work restrictions for Romanians and Bulgarians are removed on January 1. The study found that Britain had overtaken Germany as the most popular destination for young Romanians wanting to emigrate. In Bulgaria, the OECD pointed to a National Public Opinion Institute study which found that 12 per cent of Bulgarians surveyed planned to emigrate one restrictions on free movement to the EU were lifted. This is the equivalent of 876,000 of the population. Looking at the education sector, the report also found that the UK is one of six countries where international students are over-represented among the universities and other higher education institutions when compared to the number of foreign-born persons in the population. But the report concluded that the take-up of social benefits by immigrants relative to native-born households in the UK is lower than the average seen in all OECD countries, across all types of benefits.","Higher percentage of male migrants in work than British men since 2007 .

"A doctoral student has delivered a stranger's baby after seeing her in distress at a busy campus bus stop - and later learned the new mother had named the newborn girl after her. Emily Brewer, 36, was catching a bus home with her two-year-old son, Dylan, from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on Wednesday when she noticed a woman gesturing to her. The woman led her to another, heavily-pregnant woman who spoke Spanish and no English, but Ms Brewer soon learned that her waters had just broken - and that she was in obvious pain. Ms Brewer asked the woman how pregnant she was and, as she eventually understood the woman was 38 weeks along, a baby girl dropped into her loosened trousers. Delivery! Aguilar Lopez, pictured with her daughter and a paramedic, gave birth to the baby girl at a bus stop by the University of North Carolina - with the help of a stranger, Emily Brewer . 'It was what every mother-to-be dreads,' Ms Brewer told MailOnline. 'She was out running errands and her waters broke. But she stayed so calm, she was never in a lot of dire pain. It was very quiet.' Ms Brewer placed her son on the bus stop's bench and called 911, and the dispatcher led her through the final processes, telling her how to use a shoelace to cut the umbilical cord. The dispatcher also told her to clean the baby's nose and mouth and, without a sterile alternative, the team used the mother's scarf. Despite the bizarre situation near the busy campus, with students milling past, Ms Brewer said she stayed calm. Official meeting: Just hours after the new mother was whisked off by paramedics, Brewer tracked Lopez down in hospital and met the baby girl, named Emily, with her own child, Dylan . 'Being a mum myself, I was able to . put myself in her shoes and imagine how scared I would have been,' she . said. 'If an undergraduate had seen her, I'm not sure they would have . been able to help.' New mother: Brewer said Lopez was extremely calm and quiet throughout the whole ordeal . She added that her son witnessed some . of the birth but did not seem bothered by it. He even asked whether the . baby had grown into the woman's trousers. Moments after the delivery was . complete, paramedics from Orange County EMS swooped on the scene and . took the new mother and her daughter to hospital just a mile away. But as the events sunk in, Ms Brewer, from Carrboro,  said she needed to know what had happened to the mother. 'It was all I could think about,' she told MailOnline. 'I just felt like our fates had crossed and we needed to meet again.' So on Wednesday evening, Ms Brewer went to the hospital with Dylan and her husband, Patrick McDonough, to try to track down the woman and her newborn. A nurse put the pieces together and asked the new mother, who they learned was called Aguilar Lopez, for permission for the family to visit. 'The nurse said her face lit up,' Ms Brewer said, adding of Lopez: 'She was calm and happy and beautiful, and the baby was at her side wrapped up.' The mothers officially met, and Ms Brewer was introduced to the eight-hour-old baby girl, who was a health 5lb 9oz. And when Lopez asked Brewer for her . name, the new mother noted it down. Brewer later learned that the new . baby had been named Emily, because Lopez thought she was 'an angel'. Scene: Brewer spotted Lopez at a bus stop on the campus of UNC Chapel Hill as she was heading home . 'I am humbled,' Brewer said. 'Every single person who participated in my son's birth is in my memory and always will be. To know that I am part of this woman's birthing experience is just extraordinarily humbling.' After handing in her dissertation for her doctorate - on 18th and 19th century English Literature - on Monday, celebrating the presidential election on Tuesday, and stepping in as a honorary midwife on Wednesday, Brewer said she wonders what else will happen this week. But there's one thing she does know. 'I really feel like we will meet again,' she said of Lopez.","Emily Brewer, 36, was heading home when she saw Aguilar Lopez in distress .

"A teenage driver who had held his license for one day killed two 15-year-old female passengers after he crashed into a tree while going double the speed limit on a rural road. Preston Maher, 16, had received his license the day before the October 5 crash in the city of Spokane Valley in eastern Washington, court records revealed today. Documents also showed the teenager may have been driving to 'get air' when the fatal crash took place. KREM reports the 16-year-old is recovering from injuries and hasn't been charged. The case is being investigated as vehicular homicide. Scroll down for video . McKenzie Mott (left) and Josie Freier (right) were killed in a car crash while being driven by a teenage friend on October 5 in Spokane County, Washington . Preston Maher had held his driving license for one day and was believed to be speeding when he crashed his car into the tree late at night . The teen was giving the two girls a ride from a birthday party on the Saturday night around 9pm. Investigators believe he was driving 50mph in a 25mph zone when he lost control of his Infiniti Sedan and hit a tree along a section of road known as the Ponderosa Jump. The car struck the tree on the passenger's side. The crash killed McKenzie Mott and Josie K. Freier, both University High School students. Maher was taken to hospital in critical condition but later released. Alcohol or drugs do not appear to be a factor in the crash, investigators said and all three teens were wearing seatbelts. Hundreds remembered the girls at a memorial service on October 6 at the school football field where friends and classmates described them as always having smiles on their faces. Students, loved ones and members of the local community held white candles during a moment of silence for McKenzie and Josie. Miss Freier's family asked that instead of flowers that toys be donated through local fire stations to Toys For Tots which was Josie's favorite. University High School Senior Khalil Williams told KHQ: 'There are going be a lot of sad people. I'm hoping we can all come together and try to focus on keeping their . memory preserved, but it will definitely be hard, that is for sure.'

"Two more men have been arrested on terrorism charges ahead of the NATO summit in Chicago, bringing the total number of alleged conspirators to five. It's unknown whether Sebastian Senakiewicz, 24, and Mark Neiweem, 22, both of Chicago, were part of the same plot that led police to bust three out-of-state activists last last week. Those men; Brian Church, 20, of Fort Lauderdale, Florida; Jared Chase, 24, of Keene, New Hampshire; and Brent Vincent Betterly, 24, of Oakland Park, Massachusetts; allegedly planned to use Molotov cocktails to attack President Barack Obama's campaign headquarters, Mayor Rahm Emanuel's home and several police stations. 'Homegrown terrorists': Sebastian Senakiewicz, 24, (left) and Mark Nieweem, 22, (right) are the newest suspects arrested on terrorism charges and suspected of plotting attacks against the NATO summit . Suspects: Brian Church (left), Jared Chase (center) Brent Vincent Betterly (right) were the first terror suspects arrested. They are charged with plotting to attack President Barack Obama's campaign headquarters . The Chicago Tribune reports that Senakiewcz was arrested Thursday on charges of terrorism and making a false threat. Prosecutors say he had been planning with at least three other people to use Molotov cocktails in an attack at the NATO summit. Neiweem faces charges of attempted possession of explosives, as well as terrorism and making a false threat. Nieweem is a member of the Anarchist Black Cross and is active on anarchist message boards, WLS-TV reports. In April, he gave a presentation called 'Why This Isn't Scary: Anarchy, Communism, Socialism and The Black Bloc' at a protect called Chicago Spring. He is currently on probation from a 2010 arrest after he punched a Chicago police officer, who tried to question him. High alert: Security remains high in Chicago ahead of the NATO summit that will features 60 delegations from around the world . The first three suspect, who were arrested Wednesday, are each being held on $1.5million bail. The trio is facing charges of conspiracy to commit terrorism, possession of an explosive or incendiary device and providing material support. During the Wednesday night raid, police seized four completed Molotov cocktails in beer bottles and weapons, including a mortar gun, swords, a hunting bow, throwing stars and knives with brass knuckle handles, according to law-enforcement records cited by the South Florida Sun-Sentinel. The suspects also had protective gear such as pre-positioned shields, assault vests and gas masks to help hide their identity during the planned attacks, prosecutors said. Court documents indicate that authorities likely have audio recordings of the suspects discussing their plot, which allegedly included attacking other jurisdictions. The trio also talked about planned escape routes and held late-night training sessions for engaging in combat with police, prosecutors said. Carefully guarded: Protesters walk past Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel's house today as police officers guard it . ‘The city doesn't know what it's in for,' an undisclosed defendant is quoted as saying in court records. The three young men apparently came to Chicago late last month to take part in May Day protests. Six others arrested Wednesday in the raid were released Friday without being charged. Defense attorneys alleged that the arrests were an effort to intimidate the thousands of people expected to stage protests during the meeting of world leaders. They told a judge that undercover police were the ones who brought the Molotov cocktails. 'This is just propaganda to create a climate of fear,' defense attorney Michael Duetsch said. Later, outside the courtroom, Duetsch said two undercover police officers or informants who called themselves 'Mo' and 'Gloves' were also arrested during the Wednesday raid, and defense attorneys said they later lost track of the two. 'We believe this is all a setup and entrapment to the highest degree,' Duetsch said. Chicago police Lt. Kenneth Stoppa declined to elaborate on the case beyond confirming the charges against the three who were still in custody. March: Protesters held an impromptu rally on the Michigan Avenue bridge on Friday . The suspects’ attorney, Sarah Gelsomino, said her clients are ‘absolutely in shock and have no idea where these charges are coming from.’ Activist Bill Vassilakis, who told the New York Daily News that he let the men stay in his apartment, described Betterly as an industrial electrician who had volunteered to help wire service at The Plant, a former meatpacking facility that has been turned into a food incubator. Vassilakis described the 24-year-old as a ‘stand-up’ guy and said that the charges against him were unwarranted. ‘He and the other guys had done nothing but volunteer their time and energy,’ he said.’ Betterly appears to have a history of minor run-ins with law enforcement. The South Florida Sun-Sentinel reported that in February, Betterly was cited for disorderly intoxication after taking a swim in a high school swimming pool and vandalizing the cafeteria. The case, however, was later dismissed. Chase grew up in New Hampshire and moved to Boston a few years ago before becoming active in the Occupy movement, said his aunt, Barbara Chase. Provoked: Police officers largely ignored taunts during this week's rallies and showed restraint in arresting protesters . Church is an emergency medical technician and is studying to become a paramedic, according to his mother, who asked to remain anonymous. She added that her son supports the Occupy movement and traveled to Chicago in late April to join the anti-NATO protests. One of the other six protesters who were jailed and released, activist Darrin Annussek, of Philadelphia, denied there were Molotov cocktails, or the raw materials needed to make them, in the apartment. ‘No way,’ Annussek told reporters after his release. ‘If I had seen anything that even resembled [a Molotov cocktail], I would have left.’ Annussek claimed that during 18 hours in custody, police never told him why he was arrested, read him his rights or allowed him to make a phone call. He said he remained handcuffed to a bench, even after asking to use a restroom. ‘There were guards walking by making statements into the door along the lines of `hippie,' `communist,’ `pinko,’’ he said. According to law enforcement officials, the Wednesday raid was the culmination of a month-long investigation into a group suspected of making Molotov cocktails – homemade bombs created by filling glass bottles with gasoline, the Chicago Tribune reported. However, the National Lawyers Guild, which is representing the three suspects, said they had beer-making equipment when the apartment they were staying at was swarmed by officers dressed in black and armed with battering rams and guns. Restraint: Police trailed protesters on bicycles and on foot during a Friday demonstration, but went out of their way to keep the number of arrests down . The men also were in a car that was stopped by police a week ago, leading to a YouTube video of the stop that has prompted protesters to complain Chicago Police were harassing the occupants, their attorney said. The two-day NATO summit will get under way on Sunday, bringing together delegations from some 60 nations, including 50 heads of state, who will discuss the war in Afghanistan and the European missile defense plan. On the first day of the talks, thousands of protesters are expected to march two-and-a-half miles to the McCormick Place convention center, where delegates will be meeting. Security has been high in Chicago in anticipation of the high-profile, although the protests have been marked by relatively few arrests. Mounted: Police horses blocked some intersections as groups of protesters who broke away from the main rally wound through the city . On Friday, police officers on bicycles and foot followed throngs of noisy activists through the streets of the city, but ignored taunts in an effort to avoid detaining people. In all, police said there was a single arrest on a charge of aggravated battery of a police officer. Another man was briefly taken into custody, but was released shortly after. Also, officers were seen trying to arrest a man who scaled a bridge tower and pulled down part of a NATO banner. Earlier, police handcuffed a man at the end of a raucous but largely peaceful rally organized by National Nurses United, one of the largest nurses’ union. Participants of the rally demanded a ‘Robin Hood’ tax on banks' financial transactions. The event drew several thousand people and featured a performance by former Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello, an activist who has played at many Occupy events. At one point, on the bridge at Michigan Avenue, the gateway to the city's famed shopping district, the Magnificent Mile, the number of officers swelled and they appeared ready to forcibly remove dozens of protesters who sat in the middle of street. Instead, police simply waited for the demonstrators to leave on their own.","Sebastian Senakiewicz, 24, and Mark Neiweem, 22, are the latest suspects .

"The mother of a British journalist arrested and charged with piracy in Russia begged for the release of her son today as he was denied bail. Kieron Bryan, 29, a freelance videographer who was filming a Greenpeace protest against Russian oil drilling in the Arctic, could face 15 years in prison if convicted. His mother Ann Bryan told the Daily Mail . she was ‘worried beyond belief’ about her son and described her ‘total . disbelief’ at his arrest and detention. She said: ‘We just feel total disbelief and are in . complete shock. We’re worried beyond belief but we’re trying to keep . strong and positive for him because we’re no good to him if we fall . apart.' Mr Bryan was arrested along with another journalist and 28 activists after the coastguard stormed the ship they were aboard and detained them. In the dock: Mr Bryan, is charged with piracy which his mother labelled 'ludicrous' Charged: Kieron Bryan appeared at a bail hearing. He could face 15 years in prison if convicted . Journalist: Freelance videographer Mr Bryan was filming the protest against Russian oil drilling. His mother Ann Bryan said she is 'worried beyond belief' at his arrest and charge . His distraught family say he is a journalist, not an activist, and was only doing his job, so the Russians should let him go. Celebrities including actor Jude Law, Blur’s Damon Albarn and fashion designer Vivienne Westwood have called for his release along with hundreds of journalists worldwide. Even Russian President Vladimir Putin’s human rights adviser has also urged prosecutors to drop piracy charges against those arrested. ‘These charges are laughable because there isn’t the slightest justification for accusing the crew of the Arctic Sunrise of piracy,’ Mikhail Fedotov said in an interview in Moscow. Worry: Kieron and his parents Ann and Andy Bryan . Today, a court in Murmansk ruled that Mr Bryan, of London, should remain in pre-trial detention ahead of a hearing on November 24. Russia arrested all 30 people on board the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise on September 18 after it approached an oil drilling rig owned by state-controlled Gazprom. Those on board – including six Britons – have been accused of piracy, which carries a maximum sentence of 15 years. So far, all six bail applications made have been refused. Today, Mr Bryan told the court that he had ‘verbal agreements with many leading TV companies’ to provide them with footage of the protest upon his return. Detained: 29-year-old Mr Bryan was arrested along with another journalist and 28 activists after the coastguard stormed the Greenpeace vessel . Arctic Sunrise: The Greenpeace vessel was boarded by Russian authorities after a peaceful protest against Arctic oil drilling. Russia arrested all 30 people on board the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise on September 18 after it approached an oil drilling rig owned by state-controlled Gazprom . Lawyers for Mr Bryan and Philip Ball, of Oxfordshire, argued that Gazprom's Prirazlomnaya oil platform was more an island than a ship, so piracy charges shouldn’t apply. On the decision to deny her son bail, Mrs Bryan said: ‘We are disappointed obviously, but it’s nothing more than what we were expecting going by the last few weeks. The school administrator, from Shebbear, Devon, described her emotions when he was first arrested adding: ‘It was so awful. We got a phone call from Kieron saying he was being taken to Murmansk and that it would take a few days to sort out but not to worry. ‘As each day goes by, the worry just gets worse. I beg Russia to find a sensible way out of this and to be reasonable and just. ‘Kieron is not a member of Greenpeace and never has been. He was simply employed by them. He is a journalist and is just doing his job. ‘He is always professional and impartial.' She added that the charge of piracy was ‘ludicrous’. Today, John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said of the refusal to grant bail: ‘This decision flies in the face of all reason. ‘We have offered the Russian courts significant sureties that would guarantee the return of all those accused if and when a trial took place. Activists: Greenpeace International activist Phillip Ball standing in the defendant cage at the Leninsky District Court of Murmansk, Russia. He was arrested at the same time as Mr Bryan . ‘The decision of the court to refuse bail looks increasingly like the Russian authorities are meting out unnecessarily harsh punishment even before any trial. ‘In the case of Kieron Bryan, he is a professional journalist, travelling on the Greenpeace ship, witnessing a peaceful protest against oil drilling in the Arctic Ocean. ‘He has committed no crime and should be released immediately.’ Politicians and celebrities have already demanded the immediate release of the freelance videographer. The UK government has raised the case of the six detained Britons with the Russian authorities. The other Britons being held are Frank Hewetson from London, Anthony Perrett from Newport in Wales, Alexandra Harris, originally from Devon and Iain Rogers, from Exeter.","Kieron Bryan was arrested with another journalist and 28 activists after coastguard stormed Russian ship .

"Bulgarian archaeologists have unearthed a well-preserved poison ring, used to spike an opponent's goblet of wine or dinner with a deadly dose of toxicity. The 14th Century piece of jewellery was found at the site of a medieval fortress on Cape Kaliakra close to the town of Kavarna on the Bulgarian Black Sea coast. Archaeologists believe the ring would have likely belonged to a wealthy and power-hungry male with political ambitions and was filled with poison. The 14th Century piece of jewellery was found at the site of a medieval fortress on Cape Kaliakra close to the town of Kavarna on the Bulgarian Black Sea coast. Archaeologists believe the ring would have likely belonged to a wealthy and power-hungry male and was filled with poison . It is the first ring of its kind to be uncovered in Bulgaria, according to the deputy director of the National Archaeology Institute and Museum in Sofia, Boni Petrunova. She told the Sofia Globe, that the ring is made of bronze and has a small box welded to the bezel. Dr Petrunova said: 'I have no doubts that the hole is there . on purpose and the ring was worn on the right hand, because the hole was . made in such a way so as to be covered by a finger, so that the poison . can be dropped at a moment’s notice.' 'Clearly, it was not worn constantly and would have been put on when necessary.' She believes the ring is proof that poison was used in politically-motivated murders in Medieval Bulgaria but thinks the poison itself would have originated from Spain or Italy, which had good trading relations with Bulgaria. It is probable the ring was used in a squabble between the ruler of the independent Despotate of Dobrudja called Dobrotitsa and his son Ivanko Terter, in the second half of the 14th century. Dr Petrunova said the conflict is the most likely cause of deaths of members of the ruling class nearby the Kaliakra fortress. The artefact helps to add some extra knowledge about life on Cape Kaliakra in the 14th Century, was home to the local aristocracy. Dr Petrunova said: 'I have no doubts that the hole (pictured) is there on purpose and the ring was worn on the right hand, because the hole was made in such a way so as to be covered by a finger, so that the poison can be dropped at a moment's notice . More than 30 items of jewellery, mostly made of gold have been found at the site since 2011. Kaliakra was, for a short while, the capital of a principality that was situated between the Danube Delta and present-day Bourgas. Dobrotitsa was in charge at the peak of its power and had enough military muscle to fight in the Byzantine civil wars. Together with Venice, an ally, he challenged the Genoese naval rule of the Black Sea. However, the principality was taken over by the Ottomans in the early 15th century after the Battle of Varna, when sultan Murad II defeated Hungarian and Polish forces. King Wladyslaw III of Poland died fighting in the battle and is known as Vladislav Varnenchik in Bulgaria. It has not been revealed if toxicology . tests have been run on the ring to ascertain the particular type of . poison that might have been kept inside or if there are still traces on . the ring. There is also some conjecture between historians as to whether the ring really was intended to house a toxic substance, with some people suggesting it could have simply been an unusual reliquary ring, used to keep the remains or objects associated with saints.","The 14th Century piece of jewellery was found at the site of a medieval fortress on Cape Kaliakra on the Bulgarian Black Sea coast .

"New Mum: Laura Holmes, 21, explained to Good Morning Britain viewers how she was left scarred for life after being mauled by her friend's dog . A young mum whose face was left 'hanging off' after being mauled by a close friend's dog today vowed to sue the owner for thousands of pounds in compensation. Laura Holmes said she was unable to look in the mirror after the attack by the American Akita dog left her scarred for life. The 21-year-old needed 60 stitches after the nine-year-old beast, called Koda, jumped at her and tore chunks of flesh from her mouth and cheek. The dog's owner Tracie Taylor, 49, become the first in Britain to be prosecuted under tough new laws after failing to control the seven stone Akita. Miss Holmes has instructed an injury lawyers in a bid to get compensation for the attack, which left her fearing for the life of her unborn child.

'Everything was up in the air, I was just trying to get the dog off my arm. 'When I went to escape the dog clutched my leg. 'I hit it with this leg (her right leg). 'I'm not really horrible to dogs but you'll do anything to get them off.' The heavily pregnant young woman explained that she broke free and escaped the bedroom racing to a nearby bathroom. Recovery: Laura Holmes has had significant re-constructive surgery but admits she can't look in the mirror . American Akita dog, Koda, (right) suddenly leapt up and tore chunks of flesh from Laura Holmes (pictured after the attack) mouth and cheek leaving her needing 60 stitches . 'The door was shut already,' she said. 'I opened the door, went to turn around to hide my bump behind the door, and the next thing I knew the dog was there trying to get into the bathroom at me. 'I got my left arm stuck in the door. 'I just kept pushing the door, I wasn't bothered about my arm, I just kept pushing the door. 'I didn't want it to do any more damage. 'I know it had done quite a lot, but I didn't want it to do any more, not go for my stomach. 'The door finally shut and it was just relief.' Dangerous: This is Koda, the American Akita who attacked Laura Holmes. It was destroyed shortly after the attack and it emerged it had already bitten someone else four years earlier . Painful: Miss Holmes also has the scars from the attack all over her body, including her arms . Miss Holmes, from Nottingham, was rushed to Queen's Medical Centre, where surgeons battled to save her face and her baby. She had to give birth to baby Nathaniel - now 15 weeks old - by C-section because doctors felt she may not be able to withstand the pain of a natural birth due to her injuries. Irresponsible dog owners who allow their dog to attack people or assistance dogs will face tougher prison sentences from today. Changes to the Dangerous Dogs Act will also mean dog owners can now face prosecution if their dog attacks a person in their home or on any private property, except if they attack a trespasser. The maximum sentences for allowing a dog to attack someone have also been substantially increased. The maximum prison sentences in England and Wales are now: . Up to 14 years, from two years, for a fatal dog attack. Up to five years, from two years, for injury. Up to three years if an assistance dog is attacked. The new mum said her son had been left unaffected by the ordeal and 'doesn't know anything different.' In a landmark prosecution, the dog's owner, Tracie Taylor, received a 16-week jail sentence suspended for a year and was ordered to pay Laura just £1000 in compensation. Under new laws changed on May 13 - just a day before Laura was left with life-changing injuries - owners can be taken to court if the animal is dangerous and out of control. The dog, Koda, was destroyed shortly after the attack when Taylor, also from Nottingham, surrendered it to police and she has also been banned from owning any animals in the future. Miss Holmes is due to have further facial surgery in December but is still struggling to eat and drink after the assault. Injury lawyer Julie Walker, of Nelsons Solicitors, who is representing Miss Holmes, said: “It is clear that, through no fault of her own, this woman was savagely at-tacked by a dog which we now know had carried out a brutal attack of this nature previously. “Laura was pregnant when this attack happened and feared not only for her own life but also that of her unborn child. “She has been incredibly brave but still faces a very protracted and lengthy rehabilitation ahead of her, with further reconstructive surgery planned in the new year. “Appearance and image is hugely important, particularly to a 21-year-old girl. “Even the mirrors in her maternity room were covered by nursing staff, who were conscious of her psychological state. Before: Miss Holmes (left )before the attack, says she is lucky to be alive after the attack while she was pregnant (right) “She has only been out of her house alone on a couple of occasions since the attack happened earlier this year.” The attack meant Laura, of Nottingham, had to have extensive emergency corrective surgery while 29 weeks pregnant. She said: “Being told that you could die, as well as your child, was too terrible to contemplate. “I am slowly but surely improving and trying to be the best mum I can be for Nathaniel. “I don’t think the compensation was enough, but what is? “No amount of money can make up for this. “I could not look in the mirror for about eight weeks. My confidence has now completely gone and I don’t know if it will come back.”","Laura Holmes, 21, has instructed an injury lawyer to seek compensation .

"These luxurious calf leather handbags with beautiful silk detailing are helping women in Pakistan out of poverty. The Popinjay brand uses local artisans in rural Pakistan and offers fair wages, which allows them to become self-sufficient and provide for their families. The company is the brainchild of American-educated engineer Saba Gul. These luxurious calf leather handbags with beautiful silk detailing are helping women in Pakistan out of poverty: The Trinidad Tote (left) sells for $420 (£259) on popinjay.co and the Baracoa clutch bag (right) goes for $185 (£114) Saba Gal, who set up the company in 2011, with two of the workers . Saba, who is from Pakistan herself, says she felt heartbroken at the lack of opportunities for women in her home country but it was hearing the story of a 12-year-old Afghan girl called Azaada Khan that inspired her to take action. Azaada . pretended to be a boy for in order to be allowed to attend . school during a time when girls had not rights to an education. This story inspired Saba to create a programme that could provide a livelihood and skills for young women in a similar predicament in Pakistan. Popinjay handbags, designs shown above, is a socially conscious handbag label which seeks to employ and empower Pakistani artisans . The Pakistani women who create the handbags, one such worker pictured above, were once living in poverty . So in 2011, Saba left a successful career as an engineer in America and moved to Pakistan. In the summer of 2011 she launched the company's first handmade products under the . label BLISS, which was re-launched as Popinjay in the autumn of 2013. Popinjay's mission is to provide fair-wage jobs for women when they leave school. The pilot programme originally began as a non-profit scheme, which Saba funded with her own savings and money raised through an Indiegogo campaign. The women who make the handbags (pictured in the mustard fields . of Pakistan) are given a fair wage which enables them to provide for their families . Two of Popinjay's embroiderers working on the silk detailing for the handbags . A tote bag (left) and clutch (right) from the collection, which are stocked online and in boutiques around the US . However, running a non-profit programme came with unforeseen complications for someone with a start-up mentality. Saba explains: 'I heavily underestimated the frustrations of raising non-profit money. As a non-profit, BLISS was unable to convince top-tier professionals to join because equity couldn't be part of the package.' In January 2013, Saba rebranded BLISS as Popinjay, and started running it as a commercial business. The company moved from Attock to Hafizabad, which has high levels of female unemployment. Saba decided to focus on high-end handbag designs, which involved retraining the artisans and replacing cotton with fine leather and silks. The collection now includes 100 per cent calfskin leather totes, which sell for $420 (£260), and clutch bags with embroidered silk detailing for $185 (£114). The beautifully handcrafted bags can be bought online (but expect to pay $25/£15 for shipping to the UK) and are also available in boutiques across the US. The company now employs 150 women who earn $2.50-$3 (£1.50 - £1.85) per hour, which is two to three times what they were making at BLISS and approximately five times the national average in the garment trade.For more information: http://www.popinjay.co/ .","Popinjay was started by American-educated Saba Gul, from Pakistan .

"In a world where private photographs are instantly shareable and stored in the cloud, privacy is a rising concern for many people. Now, celebrities such as Miley Cyrus and members of the public alike, are embracing retro technologies in order to keep their pictures private - and on paper. Sales of Polaroid cameras, which were particularly popular in the 1980s, and produce a developed film image, have risen by around three quarters in less than a year. Scroll down for video . Sales of Polaroid cameras, which were popular in the 1980s and dispense a developed film image – have risen by around three quarters - perhaps in part due to scandals like the iCloud leak, which rock consumers' confidence that their private images and documents can be kept safe online . Kaley Cuoco, who stars in The Big Bang Theory declared: ‘Polaroids are the way to go. 'No one can get those.’ Her comments were made following a recent spate of iCloud leaks, which saw private photos of more than 100 celebrities, including Jennifer Lawrence and Kate Upton, leaked online. Creed O’Hanlon, chief executive of Netherlands-based The Impossible Project, which took over manufacturing Polaroid cameras in 2008, told The Guardian: ‘In the past 10 months we have seen a 75 per cent increase in the 18 to 25 demographic, with teenagers turning their backs on digital, for something more tangible.’ Following the iCloud leak when celebrities' private photos were splashed across the internet, Kaley Cuoco (pictured left), who stars in The Big Bang Theory declared: ‘Polaroids are the way to go. No one can get those.’ Taylor Swift chose to use the distinctive photo format for her new album, 1989 (pictured right) Polaroid was founded by Edwin H Land who, in 1926, quit Harvard University to research light polarisation. After founding his firm in 1937 he came up with the idea for an instant camera in 1943. By 1956, his cameras were a hit and the one millionth rolled off the assembly line. The first cameras used rolls of film, but in 1963 the company introduced Polacolour, the first instant colour film. By the end of the 1960s it is estimated half of US households had a Polaroid camera. In 1973, the iconic SX-70 Land Camera was launched - the first fully-automatic, motorised and folding camera that instantly produced colour photos. The Sun 600 model became popular in the 1980s and The Muppets starred in the adverts. In the 1990s the Polaroid Captiva was made in a special Spice Girls edition and the smaller iZone was rolled out for small instant portraits. Despite innovations in the 1990s and 2000s,  the company was hit by a rise in cheap digital cameras. It went bankrupt in 2001 but The Impossible Project has now taken over manufacturing Polaroid cameras. ‘Over the past six months, we have doubled the volume of films we sell and refurbished more than 30,000 classic Polaroid cameras. 'Next year, we expect these numbers to double.’ The popularity of the retro camera has been attributed to people’s love of Instagram, as well as the number of celebrities embracing the devices, including Lana Del Rey. A Polaroid photo forms the front cover of Taylor Swift’s new album, 1989, making the format fashionable again. Stephanie Sian Smith, a freelance photographer who shoots for magazines Vice and i-D, said: ‘Young people today are more nostalgic than ever and they love the old film look - hence the rise of Instagram. 'The cameras look cool and the pictures remind us of something from the past.’ The revival has taken some analysts, who declared analogue media formats dead, by surprise. Just like Polaroid sales, vinyl is also experiencing a revival, with the largest number of records sold in almost 20 years. The Polaroid company was founded in 1937 and its cameras proved such a hit that around half of households in the US had one by the 1960s. The format was used by some of the 20th century’s best loved artists and photographers, including Andy Warhol and David Hockney. But after numerous iconic models and innovations, including instant printers in the 1990s and 2000s, by 2001 with the arrival of cheap digital cameras - and later smartphones - the company behind the iconic camera filed for bankruptcy. The boss of Netherlands-based The Impossible Project, which took over manufacturing Polaroid cameras in 2008, said sales of Polaroid products have soared by 75%  in the past 10 months in the 18 to 25 demographic, while the numbers of films sold for the cameras (stock image) in the past six months have doubled .

"The first clear pictures of Amazon's much rumoured 3D handset have been revealed - and show off the four cameras used to create a 'floating screen' effect. Set to be unveiled in June, the device will use retina-tracking technology to make images on the smartphone's display appear to 'float above the screen like a hologram and appear three-dimensional at all angles.' The latest images also reveal a relatively thin handset - that looks a lot like Apple's iPhone. Scroll down for Video . Amazon's much rumoured holophone is set to be announced on June 18. The retailer released a teaser video on Wednesday, showing people's reaction to the device. Previously images of the handset have leaked online. The latest images (pictured) reveal a relatively thin handset - that looks a lot like Apple's iPhone . The device has a front facing camera in each corner of the screen. These extra cameras are used to track the position of the user’s face and eyes in relation to the phone’s display. This allows Amazon’s software to make constant adjustments to the positioning of on-screen elements, altering the perspective of visuals on the screen and making them appear to be in 3D - without the need for glasses. 'Multiple trusted sources have verified the authenticity of the image, which was created for internal use by graphic designers at Amazon,' web site BGR said. The handset appears to take design cues from Apple's iPhone 5 and Google's Nexus handset. 'As can be seen in this new image published exclusively by BGR, Amazon’s phone will feature an overall look that is similar to many full touch smartphones currently on the market,' said BGR. 'In fact, it appears to take design cues from several existing smartphones including Apple’s iPhone, Samsung’s Galaxy S lineup and even the HTC One, which has a polished, chamfered bezel much like the one seen on Amazon’s phone.' The handset is believed to have a 4.7-inch display with 720p HD resolution, a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon processor, 2GB of RAM, and six individual camera modules to make the 3D effect work. It will run a highly customized version of Google’s Android operating system similar to the one seen on Amazon’s Kindle Fire tablets. The handset will be revealed in June and launched in September, the report claims. This would pit it directly against Apple's upcoming iPhone 6, which is also expected to go on sale in September. The Amazon handset has a beveled edge similar to apple's iPhone 5 . Apple's patented system is slightly different to the 3D display Amazon is rumoured to be working on. The first pictures of Amazon's 3D handset were revealed last week, pictured, and appeared to feature four cameras and retina-tracking technology that are used to create a 'floating screen' effect . Previously the site has obtained images of the handset sheathed in a protective case. 'Finally, we have obtained exclusive photos of a prototype of the unreleased device, giving the world its first look at Amazon’s hotly anticipated phone, web site BGR said. 'As can be seen in the images, the device is covered by a protective shell intended to prevent people without authorization from seeing the physical design of the phone.' KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also believes the firm will launch a phone. 'We predict Amazon (US) will launch its own brand smartphone in 3-6 months, using the same hardware strategy as used for its e-reader and tablet,' he recently wrote. 'The supply chain will start stocking up materials in Q2 2014 for production.' It comes just weeks after the firm launched Fire TV, a set top box that doubles as a games console. The box allows users to download films and TV shows, along with apps.To play games, users can use a remote, or buy a separate game controller for $40. The handset is shown in a special protective case to shield its final design. However, the four cameras are clearly visible in each corner . The handset look almost like Nokia's Windows Phone with its large, rounded shell - although that is believed to be simply to hide the final design . Mike Frazzini from Amazon Games said each game will be priced like a phone app, costing on average $2. Games available at launch will include Minecraft, driving game Asphalt 8 and first person shooter Sev Zero, created by the games studio double Helix Microsoft bought recently. Peter Larsen from Amazon said the firm wanted to 'invent and simplify' with the box. 'It's incredibly powerful, and it's unbelievably simple,' he said. The move would pit Amazon in a battle with Google and Apple, which is expected to unveil its latest iPhone in September . 'Tiny box, huge specs, tons of content, incredible price—people are going to love Fire TV,” said Jeff Bezos, Amazon.com Founder and CEO. The service uses Amazon's existing Prime TV and film on demand service, along with Hulu Plus. The gadget, costing $99, is aimed squarely at Amazon and Roku's products along with google's Chromecast. Following Amazon's foray into the tablet market with the Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD - being shown off here by CEO Jeff Bezo - the company is said to now be working on a smartphone with a 3D screen . The firm said it plans to add more services in the future. Amazon already offers on-demand TV shows and movies free to customers who are members of Amazon's premium shipping service Prime, in both the UK and US.

"An 11,500-year-old grave containing the remains of three infants has been discovered in Alaska. The babies had been buried by North America's earliest inhabitants - 'Paleo-Indians' - who crossed over a land bridge from Siberia called Beringia, which existed at the end of the last Ice Age. Early tools found on the continent were also found alongside the babies' remains. Scroll down for video . An 11,500 year old grave (pictured) containing the remains of three infants has been found in Alaska. The babies had been buried by North America's earliest inhabitants - 'Paleo-Indians' - who crossed over a land bridge from Siberia that existed at the end of the last Ice Age . It is thought that small groups of hunter-gatherers migrated with herds of large animals and travelled around Alaska. The skeleton of a three-year-old was found four years ago at an archaeological site at Upper Sun River in the Tanana lowlands forest in central Alaska and had been cremated. Now, excavations have revealed the skeletons of two more infants in a circular pit about 15 inches (38cm) below the other child, who was buried beneath the remains of a 'seasonal' house. Experts claim that the first infant died shortly after birth and the other was a late-term foetus. It's possible they could have been twins. Anthropologist Ben Potter and his team at Alaska University said the discovery offers a rare opportunity to learn how North America's first settlers dealt with the deaths of their young. The skeleton of a three-year-old was found four years ago at an archaeological site at Upper Sun River in the Tanana lowlands forest in central Alaska (marked at A) and had been cremated . Paleo-Indians were the first people who entered and inhabited the American continents during the first glacial episodes of the late Pleistocene period. Experts think they crossed the Bering Strait from Eurasia into North America over a land bridge called Beringia that existed between 47,000 and 14,000 years ago. Small, isolated groups of the hunter gatherers and big game hunters migrated with herds of large herbivores into the heart of Alaska. Stone tools - especially projectile points and scrapers - are evidence of the earliest human activity in the Americas. The burial site also shows that ancient residents of Alaska foraged for fish, birds and small mammals, as well as large game. Scientists believe the house was occupied in summer based on the bones from salmon and immature ground squirrels found there. Dr Potter said the infant skeletons were largely complete. The first was lying face up with knees tightly flexed towards the chest. The child's left arm was flexed across the chest with hand near the chin and the right arm extended across the torso to the left. The foetus seems to have originally been placed upright with knees also tightly flexed. But when discovered, the torso was prone over the legs and the left arm extended beside the back and behind the pelvis. Stone projectile points and associated decorated antler foreshafts were discovered in the  burial pit at the Upward Sun River site. They were all coated with red ochre and are the earliest known exampled of hafted stone tools in North America . Scientists believe the house under which the remains were buried,  was occupied in summer based on the bones from salmon (stock image left) and immature ground squirrels (right) found there . Goods placed in the grave consisted of four antler rods decorated with abstract incised lined and two spear points placed parallel to each other and adjacent to the foetus. A third stone tool was placed next to the rods. They were all coated with red ochre and are the earliest known exampled of hafted stone tools in North America. 'The presence of hafted points may reflect the importance of hunting implements in the burial ceremony and with the population as whole,' the paper says. Dr Potter said domestic activities would have included hunting of salmon, small mammals and birds along with large mammals further afield. The human remains and associated burial offerings - as well as inferences about the time of year the children died and were buried - could lead to new thinking about how early societies were structured. They could also shed light upon the stresses they faced as they tried to survive, how they treated the youngest members of their society, as well as how they viewed death and the importance of rituals associated with it. 'Taken collectively, these burials and cremation reflect complex behaviours related to death among the early inhabitants of North America,' Dr Potter said. Dr Potter said: 'The infants and grave goods were placed in the bottom of the pit which was immediately backfilled with sediment containing a small quantity of burned fish and small mammal specimens from earlier consumption events. 'If individuals one and two were twins, the former survived birth for at least five weeks whereas the latter died earlier in utero. 'So the two were not interred together during a single burial event. Individual one was clearly a primary interment. Thus it is possible individual two represents a secondary burial - placed in the pit after individual one died. This scenario could explain the different positions.' He said the three year-old died later and was cremated in the residential hearth. University of Alaska Fairbanks professors Ben Potter and Josh Reuther excavate the burial pit at the Upward Sun River site. They discovered skeletons as well as decorated stone tools . Professor Joel Irish from Liverpool John Moores University, was involved in the study. He examined dental and skeletal remains to determine the probable age and other information about the infants. For the double burial, he estimated the times of death and said that one survived birth by a few weeks, while the other died in the womb. According to Professor Irish, 'the deaths are consistent with high levels of childhood death in highly mobile hunter–gatherers, which have been reported to be as high as 45 per cent in recent arctic/subarctic groups.' However, he also said that 'the nearly concurrent deaths of two infants and a child could have been more harmful than usual to the small group regarding long-term demographic effects, if additional births did not occur relatively soon.' The artifacts—including the projectile points and plant and animal remains—may also help to build a more complete picture of early human societies and how they were structured, as well as how they survived climate changes at the end of the last great Ice Age, the team said. The presence of two burial events—the buried infants and cremated child—within the same dwelling could also indicate relatively longer-term residential occupation of the site than previously expected. The remains of salmon-like fish and ground squirrels in the burial pit indicate that the site was likely occupied by hunter-gatherers between June and August. 'The deaths occurred during the summer, a time period when regional resource abundance and diversity was high and nutritional stress should be low, suggesting higher levels of mortality than may be expected give our current understanding' of survival strategies of the period, the authors wrote.","Babies were buried by North America's earliest inhabitants - 'Paleo-Indians'

"On trial: Theodore Wafer, 55, initially told police that the shooting was an accident . The white suburban Detroit man who killed an black unarmed teenager on his porch told police immediately after the shooting that it was an accident and that he didn't know his shotgun was loaded, jurors have heard this morning. The statements from Theodore Wafer, which he made to police minutes after he blasted Renisha McBride in the face, contradict his defense team's claim that Wafer feared for his life when he opened fire. Wafer, dressed in jeans and a T-shirt, met officers outside his Dearborn Heights, Michigan, home after they responded to his 911 call around 4.30am on November 2. 'What happened here?' Sergeant Rory McManmon asked, according to the recording played by prosecutors. 'A consistent knocking on the door, and I'm trying to look through the windows and the door,' Wafer said. 'It's banging somewhere else so I open up the door, kind of like who is this? And the gun discharged. 'I didn't know there was a round in there,' Wafer told McManmon. 'I don't get it. Who's knocking on your door at 4.30 in the morning? Bang, bang, bang - somebody wanting in.' This is the Mossberg pump-action shotgun that killed Renisha McBride last November. Wafer told police he didn't think it was loaded . Murdered? Renisha McBride, 19, was shot in the face through a screen door after she knocked on Wafer's house at 4.30am . Pictures of the weapon reveal that it is a Mossberg pump-action 12-gauge shotgun with a pistol grip. The pistol grip means that it is a weapon built for home defense, not for hunting - like many shotguns are used. Wafer's words minutes after the shooting stand in stark contrast to how his characterized the his feelings before the shooting. McBride's pounding on the door at such an early hour led Wafer to think his life was in danger, defense attorney Cheryl Carpenter told jurors in her opening statement on Wednesday. '""People were trying to get in."" That was reasonable for Ted to believe and that's what he believed that night,"" Carpenter said, according to the Detroit Free Press. Wafer, 55, is charged with second-degree murder in the death of Renisha McBride, who appeared on his porch three and a half hours after crashing her car a half-mile away in Detroit. He told police that the victim, later identified as 19-year-old McBride, looked like a 'neighbor girl or something.' McBride didn't live in the neighborhood, and an autopsy revealed she was extremely drunk. Wafer's lawyers say he shot McBride in self-defense. Prosecutors, however, say he should have called police if he feared for his safety. Police asked Wafer about his weapon, which was on the ground in the foyer of his home when officers arrived. 'It's a little Mossberg, you know, shotgun. Self-defense,' Wafer replied. This is the screen door that Wafer shot McBride through on November 2 last year .","Theodore Wafer's statement contradicts his attorney's claim that he feared for his life and acted in self defense when he killed Renisha McBride .

"Pledge: Jean-Francoise Cope said he will end automatic citizenship for children with only one French parent . A would-be president of France has pledged to end the right of the children of illegal immigrants born in the country to gain citizenship. Jean-Francois Cope, the leader of the main opposition party, the UMP, wants to do away with the ancient concept of 'jus soli', or 'right of the soil'. It means that a child born in France to non-French parents can acquire citizenship at birth if at least one parent was born in France. Even if this criteria is not met, parents can petition for French nationality for children born on French soil from age 13 if the child has lived in France at least five years. In Britain, one of a baby's parents has to be a UK citizen, or legally settled in the country, for the child to gain citizenship. Germany is another country which does not offer immediate legal rights to someone simply because they were born on German territory. Mr Cope wants France to have similar restrictions because of the amount of illegal immigrants flooding into the country and having children. Thousands of them are Roma gypsies who live in makeshift camps on the edge of major cities like Paris, often in large families. Last week the deportation of a 15-year-old Roma schoolgirl along with her parents and five siblings put immigration right back at the top of the political agenda. Mr Cope, a protege of former conservative president Nicolas Sarkozy, said he would introduce a new parliamentary bill to cancel automatic nationality for children of illegal immigrants by the end of the year. 'Children born in France to parents illegally on French soil cannot automatically become French,' said Mr Cope. 'It's incomprehensible and it's hardly seen anywhere else in Europe.' As UMP leader, Mr Cope is likely to run for president himself in 2017. All parties - including the governing Socialists - are doing all they can to win votes from the far right National Front (FN), which is enjoying a renaissance in France. It has long pushed for a reform of the immigration system, to include the systematic deportation of illegal immigrants, and large cuts in the number being allowed into France. Mentor: Mr Cope is a protege of former French president Nicolas Sarkozy . The FN is making huge electoral strides thanks mainly to the failing policies of Socialist President Francois Hollande. Many expect the FN to do particular well during upcoming municipal and European elections next year. Anti-immigrant rhetoric reached new heights earlier this month when Interior Minister Manuel Valls suggested that Roma gypsies could 'non integrate' and should be deported. His hardline is supported by the vast majority of French people, according to recent polls, although there have been demonstrations against his policies by students. Wednesday, Mr Valls said proposals to overhaul France's asylum system in depth would be submitted to the government by mid-November, following several months of consultations. The reform will seek to shorten the amount of time between an application for asylum and the judge's final decision.","Jean-Francoise Cope, leader of the UMP party, made the promise today .

"The race might be getting a bit uncomfortable over in the Nationalist camp. But even Alex Salmond wouldn’t have welcomed the international intervention from his latest unlikely supporter – North Korea. Russian separatists in Ukraine have already embarrassed the SNP by launching an online campaign to support independence. Scroll down for video . Even Alex Salmond wouldn’t have welcomed the international intervention from his latest unlikely supporter – North Korea . North Korea - whose leader Kim Jong-un is pictures here posing with female soldiers - is said to be strongly supportive of Scottish independence . Now North Korea, the repressive communist state led by Kim Jong-un, is reportedly keen to develop trade with Edinburgh because they ‘like the taste of whisky’. So Chung-on, director of the International Affairs Bureau of The General Association of Korean Residents of Japan, confirmed that the vote would be reported in North Korea if the Scottish Nationalists win. He said: ‘The result will be very important and if the Scots do vote to become independent, then North Korea will be prepared to respond to that.’ But he went on to say that budget concerns would probably prevent North Korea from setting up an embassy in Edinburgh. Soon after stories about the regime’s support were published, people began to post photo montages of Mr Salmond dressed as the North Korean leader online, with a variety of nicknames. And Choson Sinbo, a newspaper aimed at Koreans who live in Japan but swear allegiance to Pyongyang, also hinted at the party line on Scotland . The paper is staunchly loyal to Kim Jong-un, and its managing editor Choe Kwan-il told the Daily Telegraph: ‘I think independence would be very positive for Scotland.’ Scotland's First Minister, gesturing at the end of a press conference  in Edinburgh today, is now backed by North Korea and Russian separatists . Kremlin supporters have come out in support of the SNP. War correspondent Alexander Kots tweeted this picture of 'Babay’, a bearded pro-Russian fighter who became a minor celebrity in Crimea. The picture shows him playing the bagpipes with the caption: ‘Today we are all Scots’ He went on to say: ‘We have not reported on the vote in Scotland yet, but we will after it has happened. 'I believe every person has the right to be a member of an independent nation, to have sovereignty, to live in peace and to enjoy equality. And I believe a majority of Scots feel the same and will vote for independence.’ He added: ‘I believe independence will be positive as it will encourage personal exchanges and provide both countries with business chances. North Korea is rich in natural resources and we like the taste of Scotch whisky, so we can be beneficial to each other.’","Repressive communist state keen to develop trade links with Edinburgh .

"A chef who admitted he stuffed his wife's body in a pot and 'just slowly cooked it' for four days in an effort to cover up her grisly death has been found guilty of her murder. On the final day of his trial, a Los Angeles jury on Thursday convicted David Viens, 49, of second-degree murder in the death of his wife, Dawn, in late 2009. 'He treated her like a piece of meat and got rid of her,' the couple's best friend Karen Patterson said after the verdict. Prosecutors relied on gruesome interrogation tapes, played to jurors, in which Viens described how he shoved Dawn's body in a 55-gallon drum of boiling water and cooked it until little but her skull was left. On his own: Chef David Viens, pictured right, fired his lawyer Fred McCurry (left) in a Los Angeles court today as he awaits sentencing for the murder of his wife in 2009 . 'I ended up cooking her for four days,' the chef, who pleaded not guilty in the trial, said on the recording. According to the Los Angeles Times, the jury failed to reach a verdict on Wednesday on whether Viens is guilty of first-degree murder, second-degree murder or manslaughter. After jurors asked for the definition of second-degree murder, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Rand S. Rubin referred them to the jury instructions. During the trial, defense attorney Fred . McCurry said the evidence didn't support a first-degree murder . conviction against his client, which requires proof of premeditation. 'He treated her like a piece of meat': The couple's friend Karen Patterson told reporters justice had been done when Viens was convicted in September . Ms Patterson, who was the key witness in Viens' trial and the person who prodded police to investigate her friend's disappearance, used a news conference after the trial to urge others to report incidents of domestic violence. She apologised for failing to call 911 when Mrs Viens called her during an incident of abuse but begged her not to call police. 'Maybe you have to go beyond your friend's trust and try to save lives,' she said. However, Ms Patterson said she would nonetheless like to visit the killer in prison. 'Even through all this, he is still my friend,' she said. 'I struggle with the lovely person who killed another lovely person. I would remind him of how much Dawn loved him.' Dawn Viens' sister, Dayna Papin, said, 'There's no happy ending. Two families have suffered tremendously. This is a man I've known for 20 years who was like a father to me.'

Guilty: David Viens, pictured, gestured to family as he rolled out of court today a guilty man . Viens spoke to police on two . occasions from a hospital bed in March 2011 after throwing himself of an . 80-foot cliff in Rancho Palos Verdes when he heard he was a suspect in . her disappearance. A juror said it was that apparent suicide attempt which convinced him of Viens' guilt, adding: 'My opinion was if he was innocent, he wouldn't jump off a cliff.' The chef, who attended the trial in a . wheelchair, said in the recordings that he mixed what remained of his . wife after she was boiled up with other waste and then dumped some of it . in a grease pit at his restaurant and put the rest in the trash. He said he stashed his wife's skull in his mother's attic in Torrance. During the trial, Viens told investigators that they couldn't find his wife's . body because he had cooked it for four days in boiling water. 'For some reason I just got violent': David Viens pleaded not guilty to the murder of his wife Dawn - who disappeared in October 2009 . Los . Angeles Superior Court jurors heard David Viens make the statement in a . recorded interview with sheriff's investigators that was played in . court on Tuesday during his murder trial. A search of Viens' mother's house turned up nothing, nor did an excavation of his . restaurant Thyme Contemporary Cafe in Lomita, Los Angeles. On . the recording played in court, sheriff's Sgt. Richard Garcia asked . Viens what happened on Oct. 18, 2009, the night his wife disappeared. 'For some reason I just got violent,' said Viens. The trial against Viens opened last week, with his daughter . Jacqueline telling the court that her father had previously joked that cooking someone was a good way to get rid of the body. Body search: Police excavated the Thyme Contemporary Cafe but found no trace of Dawn Viens . On trial: David Viens told investigators they couldn't find his wife's body because he had cooked it for four days in boiling water until little was left but her skull . Jacqueline, 22, recalled the conversation . she had with her father one night in 2009. She recalled him saying that . Dawn Viens had been needling him and he just wanted to sleep. He'd tried barricading their bedroom . door with a dresser but when that didn't work, he tied her up and taped . her mouth. The next morning, Dawn Viens was dead. She said her father told her, through tears, that her body would never be found. When he was arrested, he told investigators a similar story. Defense attorney Fred McCurry . questioned Jacqueline's account of the conversation, saying she had both drank . and smoked marijuana the night it took place and her memory was 'fuzzy'. She did testify that she had never seen the couple argue and they 'seemed like they loved each other'.

Viens had claimed his wife ran away 16 months ago after an argument over whether she should go for drug rehabilitation . But . authorities were suspicious because of ‘inconsistent statements’ he . gave and the fact she left behind her wallet, mobile phone and other . personal belongings. His new girlfriend, Kathy Galvan, then . took over Mrs Viens’s job and moved into her home, before he was seen . throwing out his wife’s belongings into a dustbin behind his restaurant, . police said. Speaking about this, Jacqueline said . she had been asked by her father to bag up Dawn's clothes and take them . to a storage unit. The rest were thrown out. The 22-year-old also said that Dawn Viens was no saint. 'She'd wake up in the morning and drink all day long,' adding that the pair had done cocaine together. She also told jurors that . after the 'drunken confession', her father asked her to send a text . message from Dawn Viens' phone to one of his wife's friends saying: . 'This is Dawn. I'm OK.

"Face of a killer? Police say Thorsten Rushing, pictured, killed his father and brother after plotting the double homicide with four high school friends . A father and his teenage son were gunned down in their Oklahoma home in the pre-dawn hours of January 20 and police say it was the 18-year-old son and brother of the victims, with the help of a foursome of co-conspirators, who committed the heinous crime. Authorities originally believed Thorsten Rushing of Lawton, Oklahoma was an unwitting witness to the murders of his family members but now believe the teen masterminded the cold-blooded murder of his father Uwe Rushing, 50, and little brother Stefan, 14. Police arrested Rushing on Saturday. Also hauled in were his high school classmates Ethan Thompson, 19, Cody Davis, 19, Timothy Delahoy, 18, and Wesley Bankston, 17. The arrests shocked the comfortable . town perched between Wichita Falls and Oklahoma City and came after a . week of arduous detective work from the Lawton Police Department. But . before they could uncover their suspects, police say they had to see . past the false claims of a supposedly grieving young man. Police first responded to a call at the home on East Columbia just after 2am on Monday, January 20. There, Thorsten claimed he'd been watching television when two masked intruders forced their way inside and opened fire. Victims: Uwe Rushing, 50 (left), and his 14-year-old son Stefan (right) were gunned down in their Lawton, Oklahoma home on January 20. The following Saturday, on the same day of their wrenching double funeral service, Thorsten was arrested for the murder of his father and brother . In their wake lay the father and son. Thorsten . claimed he'd evaded the men and run off to get a shotgun before . returning fire. The men fled, he said, leaving him unharmed. Police . likely had little reason not to believe the teen at first. Photos of . the high school senior make him appear perfectly normal. In one, he poses with a pretty girl in their marching band uniforms. 'From . what we understand, they were smart kids,' Lawson police Captain . Captain Craig Akard told KSWO on Monday. 'They were polite kids.' In another Facebook photo, Thorsten smiles warmly alongside his date at the high school homecoming dance. 'Your . (sic) half right,' he told a friend who called him a handsome devil. 'I . may be somewhat handsome, but I am no devil. I am the nicest dude I . know.' Unfolding mystery: Four other teens were arrested along with Thorsten Rushing (bottom right) on Saturday. Suspected of somehow aiding Rushing in his double murder plot were Ethan Thompson, 19 (top right), Cody Davis, 19 (bottom left), Timothy Delahoy, 18 (top left) and Wesley Bankston (not pictured) 'They were polite kids': Wesley Bankston, 17 (pictured), has also been arrested in the bizarre murder case. While Bankston's photo appears menacing, the teenagers mostly appear totally normal online and police agree the crimes seem to come out of nowhere . But under the surface, police believe something must have been brooding. The funeral visitation for Uwe and Stefan was held the Friday following their deaths. By Saturday, police had arrested Thorsten and company. KSWO reports that as many as eight detectives in the intervening week had painstakingly put the pieces together of what really happened after a string of interviews and working in concert with the medical examiners in Oklahoma City. 'We are confident that we know that the 18-year-old son is the shooter,' Akard said. However, they say he had plenty of help getting to that point. And it could have happened sooner. 'Some of the boys were involved in the incident from Friday night. And from what we have figured out, something was supposed to happen that night. But when Mr. Rushing came out of the house unexpectedly, those plans had to be changed,' said Akard. Teenage selfies to icy mugshot stares: Police are confident that Rushing pulled the trigger but they are equally as convinced he had plenty of help in plotting the crime from his friends from Lawton High School (pictured L to R are Ethan Thompson, Timothy Delahoy, and Cody Davis) Police believe the attack was the end result of a double murder plot and that all five teens were involved to some degree. And, police say, at least one of Thorsten's four friends were by his side when he pulled the trigger on his father and brother. 'We are still conducting interviews based on some statements that have been made in the last week or so,' Akard said. 'Especially the last couple of days. There are other people that we have identified that we need to talk to.' A 2011 photo shows a younger Thorsten (left), his slain brother Stefan (right) and the boy's mother Lavonne Bynum, whose online profiles indicate lives in the same town but whose address is not listed as the home where the murders took place . Hard to imagine: Police have yet to suggest what motivated Rushing (pictured) to gun down his family . While the authorities continued to put the pieces of this bizarre unthinkable and crime together, the Lawton community remained in shock. 'It has taken everybody by surprise,' Akard said. 'It has taken everybody by shock that knows them how this could have happened.' A motive had yet to be released on Monday. Police said they'd already uncovered several weapons over the course of their investigation, but were unsure which if any of them were the murder weapon. Akard said they were prepared to have a case assembled and ready to present to the Comanche County District Attorney's Office within a couple of days.","Thorsten Rushing of Lawton, Oklahoma was arrested along with four teen friends on Saturday, the same day of his father Uwe Rushing, 50, and brother Stefan's funeral .

"Jimmy Savile's abuse victims have been instructed how to claim up to £60,000 in compensation in a newspaper advert published today. About 140 people have told police they were attacked by the DJ in hospitals or on BBC premises before he died in October 2011, aged 84. In February the High Court agreed a compensation scheme worth around £3million and victims will be able to make claims against Savile's estate, the BBC and the NHS. But nobody will receive more than £60,000 and should apply for cash by the start of June. Compensation: Jimmy Savile's abuse victims are being instructed how to claim up to £60,000 in compensation from his estate, the BBC and the NHS . The adverts appear in today's Times and Daily Mirror newspapers, as well as some local newspapers, and warn alleged victims they must apply for compensation in the next six weeks. Advert: This has appeared in a number of national and regional newspapers and warns that there is six weeks to put in a claim . High Court judge Mr Justice Sales sanctioned the scheme after agreement between NatWest, the executor of Savile's estate, lawyers representing Savile's alleged victims, the NHS and the BBC. He described the compensation scheme as a 'sensible and pragmatic' attempt at solving a 'complex situation', and also approved the publishing of the newspaper advertisements. The adverts advise people who wish to make a claim for sexual assault by Savile to do so within the next six weeks, by June 3. The claim scheme will be open for a year, within which it is hoped all claims will be paid, the adverts say. Lawyers initially put the value of Savile's estate at around £4 million, but Mr Justice Sales said the current value was about £3.3 million. Solicitors representing alleged victims have said that the scheme will not guarantee payouts but will provide a framework within which claims can be analysed. Savile, who worked at the BBC, has been accused of being a serial child abuser and sex offender, and was alleged to have abused people in hospitals. Lawyers have said they think the vast majority of alleged victims have already emerged.","High Court has agreed a £3million compensation fund for Savile's victims .

"President Barack Obama has received the SNL treatment with a sketch that took aim at his executive order vetoing Congress to secure the protection of at least five million immigrants from deportation. The Bill from the educational series Schoolhouse Rock! arrives at Capitol Hill to explain to a student the route he makes through Congress. But the lesson is disrupted by a calm, collected and smiling Obama who kicks him down the steps - before introducing a very laid back Executive Order. An education: SNL staged a mock version of Schoolhouse Rock! informing viewers how President Obama vetoed Congress with an executive order to protect five million immigrants from deportation . Smoking a cigarette, Executive Order explains he is used for simple things, like declaring holidays and creating national parks. That is until Obama reveals he will be used to grant amnesty to millions of immigrants. 'Whoa... Go hard or go home, right?' the flummoxed Executive Order remarks to the camera. The president then asks the student what he thinks about politics. 'I think I want to go into the private sector,' the boy remarks. 'Me too,' Obama replies with a knowing grin. The sketch comes amid a furious backlash against the president's broadcast to the nation on Thursday, announcing work permits for migrants. And analysts claim the policy - which has been months in the making - will not have the full economic benefits that widespread reforms passed through Congress would have delivered. White House sources claim Obama wanted to make the announcement by the end of the summer but was blocked by Democrats fearing it could derail election hopes for candidates in conservative states. Previously executive orders were used for simple things like announcing holidays and national parks . But in the sketch Obama pushes The Bill down the hill and uses the order to make a significant change . Video Source SNL . It was days after the party conceded an overwhelming number of congressional seats to the Republicans that Obama - now a 'lame duck' president - finally put pen to paper. Proponents of comprehensive reform cite the benefits compulsory work permits will provide for the economy. 'This is focused on people who are already in the economy today, who are contributing mightily but are basically operating in the shadows,' said Raul Hinojosa-Ojeda, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. 'Their economic potential is being held back.' The new order could boost labor income by $6.8 billion, helping to generate 160,000 new jobs and $2.5 billion in additional tax revenues, according to estimates by Hinojosa-Ojeda. However, the president's order 'falls short of a comprehensive reform that would have a more sweeping effect on the economic landscape,' said Joel Prakken of the forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers. More substantial reforms could lift economic growth by an additional 0.24 percent a year — or about $41 billion — for the next two decades, according to an analysis that Prakken contributed to last year for the Bipartisan Policy Center. Backlash: Analysts claim the move will not have the full economic impact that a bill would have delivered . Crowds lined the streets of DC with signs thanking Obama for the move which was months in the making . The reforms could also cut the federal debt by $1.2 trillion over the same period, increase home construction, lift wages and add 8.3 million workers to the economy. A broader overhaul would also create a framework for attracting more immigrants, which would mute the negative economic impacts of an aging population. As more Americans retire, the percentage of the population with jobs has slipped, limiting the ability of the economy to expand. Obama has also been criticized for simply protecting the current immigrant population, rather than promoting the immigration of more high-skilled workers. Despite repeated calls to raise the 65,000 limit on 'H-1B' visas issued to skilled workers per year, this is not covered by the executive order. Scientists, engineers and computer programmers all earn higher wages than the comparatively low-paid workers who would be helped by Obama.","Saturday Night Live staged a mock edition of Schoolhouse Rock! featuring The Bill who explains to a student how he passes through Congress .

"Concern: Coronation Street character Hayley Cropper (played by Julie Hesmondhalgh, pictured) will commit suicide in Monday's episode . Campaigners have criticised plans to show a Coronation Street character killing herself before the watershed, warning it could lead to copycat suicides among young viewers. The ITV soap sparked debate with the revelation that its much-loved character Hayley Cropper will commit suicide in Monday’s episode rather than continue her losing battle with pancreatic cancer. She is played by Julie Hesmondhalgh, a member of the British Humanist Association who has ‘strong views’ in favour of assisted dying. But the 43-year-old – who has played the transsexual wife of café owner Roy for 15 years – has now been branded insensitive for discussing the plot in a series of recent interviews to highlight her belief that euthanasia should be legalised. Miss Hesmondhalgh’s final scenes in the soap – which air at 7.30pm – will show her drinking a cocktail of drugs before dying in bed in the arms of her husband. She mixes the lethal drink herself and tells him not to touch the glass, to avoid implicating him in her death. Mr Cropper disagrees with her decision and is left filled with feelings of guilt and anger. Last night, anti-euthanasia group Care Not Killing said it was ‘irresponsible’ to schedule the storyline before the 9pm watershed when it would be seen by ‘young and impressionable viewers’. And Mediawatch UK director Vivienne Pattison said she feared the episode could lead to ‘copycat’ suicides. ‘Putting it before a 9pm watershed, we can assume fairly safely that there are going to be children watching it,’ she added. ‘They do not consume media in the same critical way adults do and are far more likely to take on as gospel truth what they’ve seen.’ Married couple: Miss Hesmondhalgh's final scenes in the soap - which air at 7.30pm - will show her drinking a cocktail of drugs before dying in bed in the arms of her husband Roy Cropper, played by David Neilson . The storyline has also reopened the national debate on euthanasia ahead of a House of Lords hearing on the issue in May. Labour peer Lord Falconer, who has tabled an Assisted Dying Bill,  called for Parliament to ‘resolve the mess’ of current legislation that makes it a crime to help the terminally ill to kill themselves. Assisted suicide is legal in Switzerland, the Netherlands and some US states. Since the Dignitas assisted dying centre opened in Switzerland in 1998, more than 180 terminally ill British people have travelled there to end their suffering on their own terms. Ex-soldier Reg Crew, who had motor neurone disease, became the first Briton to publicly go to Dignitas and commit suicide in 2003. Controversial: Since the Dignitas assisted dying centre (pictured) opened in Switzerland in 1998, more than 180 terminally ill British people have travelled there to end their suffering on their own terms . His wife, Win, was threatened with legal action when she got home but was not charged. Yesterday, Mediawatch UK’s Miss Pattison also attacked Miss Hesmondhalgh for using her role in the storyline to generate publicity for views that she endorses. She said: ‘She’s perfectly entitled to her opinion as a public citizen. But to [campaign] on the back of this I think is not a good thing. I think it’s very insensitive to do it on the back of this storyline. It’s a very emotive issue and linking it to something like Corrie which is much loved is not appropriate.’ Anthony Ozimic, from anti-euthanasia group SPUC Pro-Life, said: ‘We fear that Monday’s storyline will fail to give a medically-accurate depiction of the reality of palliative care in Britain today.’ But the plot was backed by the chief executive of pro-euthanasia group Dignity in Dying, Sarah Wootton, who said it had been approached in a ‘sensitive way’. She added: ‘TV dramas, although fictional, often reflect very real issues. We know a small, but significant, number of terminally ill people want control over the manner and timing of their death.’ A ITV spokesman defended its decision to screen Monday’s episode before the watershed, saying: ‘This storyline has been well signposted and viewers will be fully aware of the drama as it unfolds.’ He added: ‘The Coronation Street writing team independently arrived at the decision to conclude Hayley’s story in this way. This was in no way influenced by Julie or her personal beliefs.’","Hayley Cropper will commit suicide in Monday's episode, airing at 7.30pm .

And she certainly is starting the year as she means to go on,  posting a picture of herself naked in a bathtub while on vacation this month. Last year, Emily told of her excitement when she got the call to appear in Sports Illustrated, calling her fellow models 'Goddesses' and 'Venuses'. She could well be this year's cover girl, according to sources, as could model of the moment Gigi Hadid, who was a 'rookie' in last year's issue. Model Hannah Davis, Derek Jeter's girlfriend, is also linked with a starring role in the edition, which comes out on February 9. Swimsuit editor MJ Day has been tantalizing fans about just who will appear in the issue. She's been putting up pictures of the girls - but cropping off their heads to maintain the mystery. Two-time covergirl: Kate Upton is a perennial SI favorite and appears again this year . Glimpse: SI swimsuit editor MJ Day has been posting pictures of the girls - and this looks like Kate's beachy shoot . However, it looks like the ever-favorite Kate Upton - a two-time SI covergirl - has scored another shoot. Asked if she had an all-time favorite SI Swimsuit cover, editor MJ said: 'I have lots of favorite covers; it’s really hard to pick just one! One I hold dear to my heart is the 2013 cover with Kate Upton shot in Antarctica. Can’t really beat that.' Models Jessica Gomes and Portuguese model Sara Sampaio are in the issue, and we know for sure that one of last year's covergirls, Lily Aldridge, is back - as Sports Illustrated is using a picture of her from her 2015 shoot to publicize the upcoming swimsuit fan festival. Lily's fellow coverstars Nina Agdal and Chrissy Teigen are also back.

Meanwhile, MJ Day is revealing this year's new rookies every day up until the cover's release. So far, she has unveiled Erin Heatherton and Ashley Smith. The editor travels the globe for the swimsuit issue - and starts shooting the following year's issue is released. She told the New York Times last March: 'I swear when we go out on shoots, we look like a traveling band of Gypsies. There’s me, my assistant, hair stylists, a model or two, our photographer, two photo assistants and sometimes our own TV crew. 'It can be up to 12 or 15 people, and part of my job is to herd everyone and make sure we get where we’re going, which can include one location per trip, or sometimes two. 'This year, we shot on all seven continents, and it was crazy. Obviously, we don’t just take carry-ons. We have a lot of luggage. I have the cell numbers of all of the skycaps at Kennedy Airport and La Guardia, and I’ll call ahead and they meet us outside. I can’t tell you the number of times people in airports have asked if we were in a band or something. It’s kind of funny.' Peek-a-boo: Jessica Gomes on shoot for Sports Illustrated . Stunning: Jessica Gomes at the QQ Men Of The Year Awards 2014 in Sydney, Australia, in November . 'But what’s really amusing is watching reactions to the models. One of my favorite airport pastimes is people-watching, and watching people watch the models walk through the airport is hysterical. The models are obviously tall and gorgeous, in a preternaturally perfect kind of way. 'People try to be cool and not stare at them, but they can’t help themselves. Men stare. Women stare. Children stare. Even babies stare.' Rookie: Erin Heatherton makes her SI debut in the 2015 issue . Trying to hide: Erin Heatherton hides her face for editor MJ Day . 'The longest trip I’ve taken was to a shoot in the Philippines. I took three flights, two car rides, two buses and a boat to the location. It took a total of 36 hours, door to door. With all of the luggage and crew, it was insane. I wanted to die by the time we got there. 'The crew and I were dragging. The models looked just fine, which doesn’t seem fair.'

"Jumping for joy, these prized pooches have been captured on camera as they leap through the air in a stunning series of photographs. From Charlie the dalmatian play fighting with Enzi the Rhodesian ridgeback, to Belle the Kung Fu-kicking boxer these pictures show the comedic results of freeze-framing man's best friends in mid-air. Other images show Sid the Jack Russell playing Frisbee on Brighton beach and Albert the lurcher dramatically leaping over a snow-banked stream in Oxfordshire. Play fighting: Charlie the dalmatian and Enzi, a Rhodesian ridgeback tussle on the sands of Lancing Beach in East Sussex . Camera tricks: The images, such as this one of a Jack Russell, are created using a wide-angle lens and photoshop techniques . In suspense: Arty the Jack Russell leaps through the air in this dramatic shot by pet photographer Rhian White . The pictures were taken by specialist dog photographer Rhian White, 35, who has perfected the art of capturing our loyal companions over the past five years. Ms White explained how she captured the amusing moment that her mother's lurcher, Albert, became over-excited during a shoot. 'Albert was curious about a female dog that he saw on the other side of the stream,' she said. 'Albert is not especially in to leaping per say, just as and when it's more convenient to do so. There . was a bridge about two-feet-away, but clearly that was too far to go . for Albert who was determined to meet this other dog. 'Without giving it a second thought he jumped over in one flying leap. Sadly for Albert the female in question was not so keen.' Leap of faith: Albert the lurcher is pictured jumping over a stream in the Abington area of Brighton, East Sussex, after he became curious about a female dog on the other side . Catching tales: This clever composite photograph shows Sid the Jack Russell playing frisbee on Brighton Beach . Jumping for joy: Ralph the French bulldog is caught on camera leaping through the air at Lancing Beach in West Sussex, England . Ms White does not only take pictures . of action-packed jumping shots, but also portraits and the intimate . moments between dog and owner. The . dog photographer, from Brighton in East Sussex, spends an average of an . hour with her client's dogs and presents at least 30-shots of the . pooches in action. She also has plans to produce short films of dogs in future. 'When I'm doing a photo-shoot of a dog jumping I generally take multiple shots of the action,' said Ms White. 'I don't normally use every shot in a sequence. Flight of fancy: This fun freeze-frame composite photograph depicts a Staffordshire bull terrier jumping at Sheepcote Valley in Brighton . Bird is the word: Dave, a South African Mastiff, catches an Angry Birds toy in front of the old pier at Brighton beach . Snow much fun: The cold didn't bother Pandy the colly cross as he jumped to catch a ball in the snowy Lake District . 'Instead I pick and choose the best ones and then use Photoshop to add them all together. 'If you want to do it well it can take a long time. 'Short-haired dogs are easier to do than long-haired dogs.' Ms White explained how she was able to capture these candid moments of dogs at their jumping best. 'I was encouraging them to play and to have fun and a lot of them are just naturally jumpy,' she said. 'For some of the shots I am far away and the owner is holding something in the air that they are jumping towards. 'In others I have a wide-angle lens that lets me take photos of them pretty close up. Bouncing with happiness: Pip the Jack Russell and Georgie the labrador were both photographed by Ms White, who says she encourages the dogs to play and have fun . 'Normally I hold the camera with my right hand and throw things in the air with my left. 'Often it is hit and miss, but you can get some really interesting angles with this method.' However, taking such close-up shots of boisterous dogs can be a challenge, and Ms White had to be prepared to be in the thick of the rough and tumble. 'When taking shots like this it's not unusual to get landed on by the dog,"" she said. 'They don't mean to of course. 'If you're in the water it can get pretty wet - not that the dogs care. 'They are normally far too engrossed in getting the ball or stick.' Rough and tumble: Ms White says she has to be prepared to get wet if she is photographing dogs near the water, such as in this shot which was taken at Lancing Beach .","Freeze-frame photographs capture man's best friends in action as they fly through the air .

"In a speech concerning immigration last Tuesday, President Obama made it all about him. While Obama was at the Copernicus Center in Chicago, Illinois, the first-person singular was employed 91 times in the speech, CNS News reported on Friday. That figure did not include Obama quoting both a letter he received and a business owner's remarks, the website noted. MailOnline found that Obama - when neither quoting nor using the contractions 'I'm,' 'I've, and 'I'd' - said the words 'I,' 'me,' and 'my' 73 times. The contractions 'I'm,' 'I've,' and 'I'd,' meanwhile, were employed 18 times when the Obama wasn't quoting in his speech. Scroll down for video . Taking the stage: Obama (seen Tuesday) used the pronouns 'I,' 'me,' and 'my' dozens of times during his speech at the Copernicus Center in Chicago, Illinois . Heckler: Obama admitted deviating from his prepared to remarks to address hecklers in the crowd . CNS News noted that Obama's use of the first-person increased due to his response to audience members who interrupted him. 'Here, can I just say this?,' he said, per the White House transcript of his remarks. 'All right, I've listened to you. I heard you. I heard you. I heard you. All right? Now, I've been respectful. I let you holler. So let me -- (applause.) All right? Nobody is removing you. I've heard you. But you’ve got to listen to me, too. All right? (Applause.) And I understand you may disagree. I understand you may disagree. But we've got to be able to talk honestly about these issues. All right?' However, CNS News previously reported the first-person singular was employed by Obama 199 times in July. With last week's action by Obama that expanded the deferred action program and added millions of other immigrants, a harsh reality about the president's changes has come to light: Obama may be allowing them to remain in the U.S., but it doesn't mean their state will let them drive a car, get an education at an affordable rate or obtain health insurance. A patchwork of rules began to form in states - largely along political lines - after the president allowed some young immigrants to stay in the country. Conservative states like Nebraska and Arizona kept them from getting driver's licenses while liberal locations were much more welcoming in terms of state services and benefits. Now, states must make new decisions on how to respond to the president's action that allows millions more immigrants to remain in the U.S. In California, Democrats, immigration groups and health care advocates are pushing for the immigrants to receive health care under the state's version of the Medicaid program. The California Department of Health Care Services is deciding how to proceed. The president's action excludes immigrants who came to the country illegally from qualifying for federal health benefits. In Nevada, officials are drawing up a bill for the Legislature making clear that unauthorized immigrants can become teachers in the state. Current rules specify that a prospective teacher must be a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident before they can receive a teaching license in Nevada. A new gubernatorial administration in Arizona will have to decide whether to continue a hard-line approach toward state benefits that outgoing Gov. Jan Brewer took. After Obama took action in 2012 granting legal status to 1.8million young people brought to the U.S. as children, Brewer issued an executive order denying them driver's licenses or other state benefits, including in-state tuition at the state's public universities. A federal appeals court ruled the license ban was unconstitutional, and Brewer is considering an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. 'Our position is unilateral action by the president does nothing to change the fact that an illegal alien's presence is the United States is not authorized under federal law,' Brewer spokesman Andrew Wilder told the AP. Obama tried to quiet one of the three hecklers on Tuesday, saying 'I've heard you. But you’ve got to listen to me, too. All right?' Arizona's Republican Governor-elect, Doug Ducey, has said he intends to continue Brewer's current ban, if it survives court challenges. Maryland's Democratic governor, Martin O'Malley, has taken a decidedly different tack. He's a supporter of state laws granting in-state tuition to people without legal status and grants them driver's licenses. He has even been willing to get into a policy fight with Obama on the stream of unaccompanied immigrant children from Central America over the Mexican border, criticizing the White House proposal earlier this year that could have expedited the deportation of the children. Arizona remains an outlier in its treatment of immigrants granted work permits and is among the most harsh when it comes to those who remain in the U.S. without legal authorization. States surrounding Arizona provide in-state tuition to all residents, regardless of immigration status. And in January, California joins nine other states in allowing immigrants who can't prove they're in the U.S legally to get a driver's license. Utah provides leniency when it comes to driving privileges and education, despite passing a law in 2011 that mirrored Arizona's landmark immigration crackdown, SB1070. The state issues driving-privilege cards that must be renewed annually for those who cannot prove they're in the country legally. Nearly 36,300 were issued last year, said Nannette Rolfe, the director of Utah's Driver License Division. Utah also offers in-state tuition at public universities and colleges to residents not in the U.S. legally. To be eligible, students must have attended a Utah high school for at least three years and earned a diploma or GED. They can't hold a non-immigrant visa and must file an application to legalize their immigration status when eligible to do so. In the 2012-2013 academic students, 929 students took advantage of the program. Despite the fact that life would be easier if he left the state, Arizona resident Christina Avila said he's staying put. 'This is where we got dirty as kids, this is where we learn how to speak English, this is where we learn how to do a lot of stuff,' he told the AP. 'Here in Arizona is where my friends, my family, live and I don't see it as an option to run away, but rather stand up and change the conditions that we live under.'","Obama delivered the speech at the Copernicus Center in Chicago, Illinois .

"A probe by a Congressional committee into the September 11, 2012 attack on a US compound in Benghazi debunked allegations that President Barack Obama's administration fell down on the job. Since the assault on the US mission in the Libyan city, which left the ambassador and three colleagues dead, the White House, CIA and State Department have been accused of mishandling their response. But the report released Friday by the House intelligence committee, which is led by some of Obama's fiercest Republican opponents, cleared the administration of all the most serious charges. Scroll down for video . The final report: A two-year investigation by the Republican-controlled House Intelligence Committee has found that the CIA and the military acted properly in responding to the 2012 attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya . Under attack: A vehicle and the surrounding area are engulfed in flames after being set on fire inside the US consulate compound in Benghazi late on September 11, 2012 . Grim day:  President Barack Obama looked on as caskets of four US diplomats killed in an attack in Benghazi, Libya, were brought back to the US. No wrongdoing has been found by Obama administration appointees . One claim investigated was that the Central Intelligence Agency had not provided adequate security for its own agents at an annex near the diplomatic mission, and Washington had failed to send support. But the report, based on 'thousands of hours of detailed investigation' and interviews with both senior officials and agents who had been on the ground found that this had not been the case. 'CIA ensured sufficient security for CIA activities in Benghazi and, without a requirement to do so, ably and bravely assisted the State Department on the night of the attacks,' it said. 'Appropriate US personnel made reasonable tactical decision that night, and the committee found no evidence that there was a stand-down order or a denial of available air support. 'The CIA received all military support that was available,' it added. Damage: A burnt house and a car are seen inside the US Embassy compound  following the overnight attack.  It was initially believed the attack was carried out by an angry mob responding to a video but was later determined to have been a terrorist attack . The report did conclude, however, that the State Department diplomatic compound where Ambassador Chris Stevens was killed had inadequate security and had needed CIA assistance. The committee also found that there was 'no intelligence failure prior to the attacks' as the US mission was aware of the worsening security situation in Benghazi but not of a specific planned attack. The 2012 attack, which came on the anniversary of the September 11, 2001 Al-Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington, was carried out by Libyan militias and extremists, some with Qaeda ties. But after it was carried out, then US ambassador to the UN Susan Rice blamed the attack on a spontaneous local protest provoked by a privately-made propaganda film that attacked Islam. National Security Advisor Susan Rice listens as US President Barack Obama talks with members of his cabinet at the White House in Washington, DC, November 7, 2014 . During a highly charged presidential campaign, Obama's critics accused the administration of denying the Al-Qaeda role in the attack in order to protect the president's counterterrorism record. But the report concluded that Rice had based her remarks -- which did indeed prove false -- on an intelligence assessment that was believed correct at the time. The report also tried to put to rest a persistent rumor that began after the attacks that the CIA had been using the Benghazi base to covertly smuggle Libyan weapons to Syrian rebels. 'The eyewitness testimony and thousands of pages of CIA cables and emails that the committee reviewed provide no support for this allegation,' it said. In fact, the report said, the CIA agents at the facility were tracking on local groups smuggling weapons, not collecting them themselves. The report also said that, while some government agencies were slow to respond to its queries, all eventually cooperated with the inquiry and no CIA personnel were intimidated by the administration.","Declassified version of House Intelligence Committee is released .

"These days drones are used for everything from farming to surveying remote regions to waging war. So it makes sense that one Dutch designer has penned the Drone Survival Guide, which like bird watching charts, shows the various shapes and sizes of flying objects by their silhouettes. Ruben Pater’s guide, however, details the differing kinds of flying robots used at war, as well as survival tips of how to hide from them. Scroll down for video . Dutch designer Ruben Pater has penned the Drone Survival Guide, which like bird watching charts, shows the various shapes and sizes of flying objects by their silhouettes . The majority of the drones selected for the chart are from NATO member countries, including the UK, France, Germany, U.S. and Canada. This is because these countries have used drones in wars such as Afghanistan and are also more transparent than some other countries in disclosing information about the robots, such as their wingspan. However, the chart also includes drones from India, China, Morocco, the United Arab Emirates and Israel. In the air: A Reaper from 39 Squadron on its approach to Kandahar after a mission. Air Vice-Marshal Philip Osborn, Joint Force Command Capability Director, said the UAVs were an 'indispensable military capability' Experienced 'pilots' operate the RAF's £10million Reaper (UAV) from a hi-tech control centre in East Anglia. The controversial craft – about the size of a small executive jet – take off from conventional runways in Kandahar, southern Afghanistan. They then fly above the battlefield for up to 14 hours, with cameras beaming live high-definition images and radar data to commanders and crew on the ground. Keeping a silent eye on a huge area, the devices are able to warn of enemy ambushes or IEDs, and locate and monitor targets while airstrikes are planned. Once authorised, they can launch the weapons to destroy them and it only takes seconds to act against enemies such as terrorist leaders and insurgents planting roadside bombs. It uses a skull icon to show that a drone is used for attack and a little eye to denote a surveillance vehicle. The . chart, which Mr Pater describes as ‘21st century bird watching’ shows . the vast array of flying war machines used today from the giant 130ft . wingspan of the Global Hawk drone to the petite Parrot AC quadcopter, . which measures just 23 inches. He said: ‘Most drones are used today by military powers for remote-controlled surveillance and attack and their numbers are growing. 'The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) predicted in 2012 that within 20 years there could be as many as 30.000 drones flying over U.S. soil alone. ‘As robotic birds will become commonplace in the near future, we should be prepared to identify them. This survival guide is an attempt to familiarise ourselves and future generations, with a changing technological environment.’ Mr Pater told Popular Science that he was inspired to make his guide after watching people in Gaza filming drones overhead to work out by the silhouette whether they were a major threat or not. The chart bearing the drone silhouettes also resembles the Airplane Spotter Cards issued during World War Two, which were designed to help servicemen differentiate between friendly and enemy aircraft. Mr Pater said that it was difficult to divide the drones into military and domestic categories as some models, such as the Scan Eagle, is a military drone used by NATO forces and is also used by the police in the Netherlands to track down drug dealers and growers. While the guide was intended as art, it includes survival tips taken from Al Qaeda’s guide to countering drones, published in 2013. They include hiding under dense tree canopies, spreading pieces of glass on cars and roofs to reflect light and using space blankets, which hide heat from infrared cameras. The guide itself is printed on aluminium paper so it is ‘a useful tool to interfere with a drone’s sensors,’ Mr Pater said. ‘On a more associative level the mirrored material reminds us that drone surveillance is ultimately people watching people. In a way we are looking at ourselves through sophisticated mirrors,’ he writes. The guide itself is printed on aluminium paper so it is 'a useful tool to interfere with a drone¿s sensors,' its creator Mr Pater said .","Dutch designer Ruben Pater penned the Drone Survival Guide, which shows the different shapes and sizes of flying robots used at war .

"More than half of Premier League clubs have hiked season-ticket prices — despite cashing in on the latest TV deal worth £5.5billion over three years. The Football Supporters’ Federation (FSF) are planning a march in protest and their chairman Malcolm Clarke said: ‘Nine out of 10 fans already think they are paying too much for tickets and these figures only back that point of view. ‘Clubs are swimming in cash and the last media deal was worth £5bn.

"Martin Bashir has resigned from MSNBC following the backlash from his inappropriate on-air comments about Sarah Palin. He released a statement on Wednesday afternoon explaining his decision to resign over the 'ill-judged' comments about the former Alaskan governor's comparison of the federal debt to slavery. He previously apologized to Palin both on and off camera, but came under further fire when fellow MSNBC host Alec Baldwin was fired for making homophobic comments to journalists outside of his apartment while he was not formally reprimanded in any way until now. Martin Bashir offered a lengthy apology to Sarah Palin on Monday following a rant where he suggested she deserved to be defecated upon . 'After making an on-air apology, I asked for permission to take some additional time out around the Thanksgiving holiday,' he said in the statement to Mediaite. Offended: Sarah Palin accepted Bashir's apology but slammed MSNBC for not firing him . 'Upon further reflection, and after meeting with the President of MSNBC, I have tendered my resignation. It is my sincere hope that all of my colleagues, at this special network, will be allowed to focus on the issues that matter without the distraction of myself or my ill-judged comments. 'I deeply regret what was said, will endeavor to work hard at making constructive contributions in the future and will always have a deep appreciation for our viewers – who are the smartest, most compassionate and discerning of all television audiences.' MSNBC later ran his comments on their website along with a brief statement from network president Phil Griffin. 'Martin Bashir resigned today, effective immediately. I understand his decision and I thank him for three great years with msnbc. Martin is a good man and respected colleague- we wish him only the best,' Griffin said in the statement. The network has disputed earlier reports that Bashir, 50, was temporarily suspended over the issue when he went 'on vacation before Thanksgiving. Palin even spoke out on the matter, saying that while she did accept his apology, the uneven treatment of Baldwin and Bashir was an example of the favoritism in main stream media. Off the air: Baldwin's show was first suspended for two weeks and then cut from the lineup entirely . 'That's the executive hypocrisy that . is so prevalent in that media elite bubble, where it depends on the . target of the vile rants.

"Family skiing holidays to Austria could soar in price by up to £140 after a new law was passed guaranteeing foreign workers minimum wage. British tour companies have also threatened to cut back on the number of holidays offered in the European country following the ruling, which will see their operating costs rise. About 500 UK staff - including chalet workers - in Austria will now have to be paid the minimum wage of £790 a month. More expensive: British tour operators could raise ski holiday prices by up to £140 in Austria . Historically,boarding and lodgings have always been considered part of workers' overall package. The penalty for companies could mean a fine of £8,000 (10,000 euros) per employee for not conforming to the Anti Wage And Social Dumping Act 2011. It comes a year after Switzerland adopted similar measures- which resulted in a rise in bookings this season in Austrian resorts, according to the Times. British tour operators are now having to consider what is sustainable to offer customers - which could mean rising prices and a reduction on the number of holidays offered. Workers in Austrian ski resorts will now be paid a full minimum wage, regardless of boarding and lodgings . Many Britons head to Austrian ski resorts for a more exciting working day - and now they are set to be better off too . Supplements for overtime, hazardous work, and festive labour will all come under the microscope to ensure foreign workers' contracts are legitimate with local law. Fraser Ewart-White, co-founder of Powder White, told MailOnline Travel: 'These highly damaging proposals would lead to a large increase in employment costs, which could see the cost of a family ski holiday to Austria rise by up to £140, jeopardising Austria's position as a value destination. 'We are working with other ski operators to challenge these plans which, if passed, will affect the viability of providing good value chalet holidays in Austria and would hurt the Austrian tourism industry immensely.' Mr Ewart-White estimates that staff costs could increase by up to 46 per cent over the nine chalets his company runs in the Austrian resort of St Anton. The introduction of the new laws in Switzerland forced many companies to close down their offerings there. Ski holiday operators could reduce the amount of trips offered in Austria . Although France remains the most popular ski destination for British skiers, 400,000 tourists from the UK chose Austria as their ski destination last year. But Austria has now signalled its intent to comply with EU rulings to clamp down on paying foreign workers less than EU nationals in the country they work in. Speaking to the Times, Andy Perrin, head of Hotelplan UK, which owns Inghams, Skie Total and Ski Esprit said: 'We first heard about this only a fortnight ago and we are trying to make sense of it. 'We take extreme exception to the suggestion that we are wage dumping. On the salary packages that we offer what our staff have in their pockets is considerably more than anyone on the minimum wage in the UK.' The knock-on effect for British tourists who are planning on, but not yet booked,  a 2015 trip to the Austrian slopes is that because companies have already taken reservations, the expenditure outlay to comply with the new laws will inextricably have to be be spread over future bookings. Of the Swiss legislation, Andy Perrin, of holiday firm Inghams and its sister companies Ski Total and Esprit Ski told The Mail on Sunday last month: ‘There are no winners with this legislation.’","Minimum wage set to be introduced regardless of boarding and lodgings .
One company executive estimates staff costs could rise by 46% .
In turn, a family ski holiday to Austria could increase by £140 .
Operators could scale back what they can offer to British tourists .
A rise in the cost of skiing holidays is inevitable to maintain profitability ."
"President Barack Obama has signed a secret order allowing the Pentagon to target Taliban fighters in Afghanistan, broadening previous plans that had limited the military to counterterrorism missions against al-Qaida, it was revealed Friday. The president's decision, made during a White House meeting with national security advisers, also gives the military the green light to conduct air support for Afghan operations when needed. Obama issued the guidelines in recent weeks, as the American combat mission in Afghanistan draws to a close, thousands of troops return home, and the military prepares for narrower counterterrorism and training mission for the next two years. Not going anywhere... yet: US officials say President Barack Obama has quietly approved guidelines in recent weeks to allow the Pentagon to target Taliban fighters in Afghanistan . Obama's moves expand on what had been previously planned for next year. In May, the president stated that US forces would have no combat role in Afghanistan next year. Missions for the remaining 9,800 troops would be limited to training Afghan troops and to hunting the 'remnants of al Qaeda.' Change of heart: Obama is said to have decided to expand the mission in recent weeks after meeting with national security advisers . One US official said the military could only go after the Taliban if it posed a threat to American forces or provided direct support to al-Qaida, while the latter could be targeted more indiscriminately. 'To the extent that Taliban members directly threaten the United States and coalition forces in Afghanistan or provide direct support to al-Qaida, however, we will take appropriate measures to keep Americans safe,' the official said. The Taliban's presence in Afghanistan far exceeds that of al-Qaida, adding significance to Obama's authorization. The president's decision came in response to requests from military commanders who wanted troops to be allowed to continue to battle the Taliban, the US officials said. The New York Times first reported the new guidelines. Officials confirmed details to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss Obama's decisions by name. Some civilian aides have argued against risking American lives next year in operations against the Taliban, saying there should only be a narrow mission against al Qaeda, The Times reported. But generals urged Obama to define the mission more broadly if intelligence showed extremists threatening American forces. Extremists: The Taliban's presence in Afghanistan far exceeds that of al-Qaida. In this picture taken on September 26, 2008, Fighters with Afghanistan's Taliban militia stand on a hillside at Maydan Shahr in Wardak province, west of Kabul . Fighters: Obama has ordered the American force presence to be cut to 9,800 by the end of this year, a figure expected to be cut in half by the end of 2015 . The decision to expand the military's authority does not impact the overall number of US troops that will remain in Afghanistan after this year. Months earlier, Obama ordered the American force presence to be cut to 9,800 by the end of this year, a figure expected to be cut in half by the end of 2015. The president wants all US troops out of Afghanistan by 2016, as his presidency draws to a close. Some of the Obama administration's planning for the post-2014 mission was slowed by a political stalemate in Afghanistan earlier this year. It took months for the winner of the country's presidential election to be certified, delaying the signing of a bilateral security agreement that was necessary in order to keep U.S. forces in the country after December. Afghanistan’s parliament has approved agreements with the U.S. and Nato allowing Western soldiers to remain in the country past the end of this year. The international combat mission in Afghanistan, which began after the 2001 US-led invasion that toppled the Taliban, was due to conclude at the end of this year. The new agreements ratified by parliament allow the US and Nato to keep a total of 12,000 troops in Afghanistan next year to support local forces. The agreements come after U.S. officials said president Barack Obama had approved new guidelines allowing American troops to engage Taliban fighters, not just al-Qaida terrorists in Afghanistan. Mr Obama’s decision also means the U.S. can provide air support when needed. In approving the agreements in a 152-5 vote, Afghan parliamentarians made no mention of Mr Obama’s expansion of the US role in fighting militants in the country.","New guidelines issued by Obama green-light air support for Afghan operations when needed .

"Advances in Stone Age man’s language and culture, might have been driven by climate change, scientists claim. Scientists believe surges in innovation in early modern human populations coincided with periods of heavy rainfall. People living in the Middle Stone Age, between 80,000 and 40,000 years ago, in an area that is now South Africa, used symbols to communicate, which have been linked to the development of complex language. People living in the Middle Stone Age, between 80,000 and 40,000 years ago, in a region that now included South Africa (pictured), used symbols to communicate, which have been linked to the development of complex language, more in times of heavy rainfall . Scientists from Cardiff University's School of Earth and Ocean Sciences, the Natural History Museum in London and the University of Barcelona, said that these symbols, as well as personal adornments made of seashells, coincided with increased rainfall and receded in dry periods. They studied a marine sediment core off the coast of South Africa and reconstructed terrestrial climate variability over the last 100,000 years to come up with their findings, which were published in the journal Nature Communications. Dr Martin Ziegler, of Cardiff University, said: ‘We found that South Africa experienced rapid climate transitions toward wetter conditions at times when the Northern Hemisphere experienced extremely cold conditions.’ Professor Ian Hall, also of Cardiff University said: ‘When the timing of these rapidly occurring wet pulses was compared with the archaeological datasets, we found remarkable coincidences. Bifacial points recovered from Blombos Cave, South Africa are pictured. The tools were made during the Middle Stone Age by anatomically modern humans. The scale bar measures 5cm . Scientists found that the disappearance of industries including decorating seashells and 'writing' symbols, appears to coincide with the transition to drier climatic conditions (illustrated) People living in the Middle Stone Age, between 80,000 and 40,000 years ago, in an area that now lies in South Africa, used symbols to communicate, which have been linked to the development of complex language. Scientists said that these symbols, as well as personal adornments made of seashells, coincided with increased rainfall and receded in dry periods. The occurrence of several major Middle Stone Age industries fell tightly together with the onset of periods with increased rainfall. The disappearance of the industries appears to coincide with the transition to drier climatic conditions, they said. The South African archaeological record is so important because it shows some of the oldest evidence for modern behaviour in early humans. ‘The occurrence of several major Middle Stone Age industries fell tightly together with the onset of periods with increased rainfall. ‘Similarly, the disappearance of the industries appears to coincide with the transition to drier climatic conditions.’ Large Northern Hemisphere cooling events have previously been linked to a change in the Atlantic Ocean circulation that led to a reduced transport of warm water to the high latitudes in the north. In response to the Northern Hemisphere cooling, large parts of the sub-Saharan Africa experienced very dry conditions. Dr Ziegler said: ‘Our new data however, contrasts with sub-Saharan Africa and demonstrates that the South African climate responded in the opposite direction, with increasing rainfall, that can be associated with a globally occurring southward shift of the tropical monsoon belt.’ The South African archaeological record . is so important because it shows some of the oldest evidence for modern . behaviour in early humans. Professor Chris Stringer of The Natural History Museum, London, said: ‘The correspondence between climatic ameliorations and cultural innovations supports the view that population growth fuelled cultural changes, through increased human interactions. ‘The quality of the southern African data allowed us to make these correlations between climate and behavioural change, but it will require comparable data from other areas before we can say whether this region was uniquely important in the development of modern human culture.’ The study examines a time in prehistoric history far before the late Stone Age, some 6,000 to 2,000 years ago. People living at this time were known to carve representative pictures into rock, epitomised by famous engravings in the Kunene region in Namiba, Africa .","Research led by Cardiff University found that increased use of Stone Age symbols and seashell decorations coincided with increased rainfall .

"Reports of the 'death of Facebook' have been ‘greatly exaggerated’, according to a major market researcher. A recent article by a University College of London professor made headlines when he said many teenagers thought Facebook was uncool and the social network was ‘dead and buried’ to them. But a study about social media that claims to be ‘the biggest of its kind’ has found that Facebook’s decline among young people has been overstated and it remains the most popular social network around the world. A new study has found that teen usage of Facebook has seen a small decline, but there is little evidence to suggest that the social network is 'dead and buried' as suggested by a previous UCL study. This chart shows the percentage change in millions of active users of all ages, between Q2 and Q4 2013 . Tom Smith, founder and chief executive of Singapore and UK-based market research firm GlobalWebIndex, which conducted the study, said the real picture is more complex than teens ditching Facebook in their droves. ‘While teen usage of Facebook has seen a small decline, there is strikingly little evidence to suggest that UCL’s findings are representative of broader trends,’ he said. Unlike the relatively small UCL study, GlobalWebIndex’s research was based on 170,000 online interviews across 32 countries, representing 89 per cent of the global Internet population. World domination: A study about social media that claims to be 'the biggest of its kind' has found that Facebook's decline among young people has been overstated and it remains the most popular social network around the world . ‘We’ve been able to show that Facebook is still used by 48.5 per cent of 16 to 19-year-olds globally on a monthly basis,’ said Mr Smith. Facebook is still the dominant, most popular social network on the planet among teens with 67 per cent more active teen users than the nearest competitor, YouTube, which is regularly used by 29 per cent of 16 to 19-year-olds, he said. Twitter is third most popular social network with 26 per cent of 16 to 19-year-olds around the world using it on a monthly basis. ‘Our GlobalWebIndex Social study shows that reports of ‘the death of Facebook’ have been greatly exaggerated,’ Mr Smith said. Facebook is still used by 48.5 per cent of 16 to 19-year-olds globally on a monthly basis. This graphic shows the popularity of different social networks for different age groups, with Tumblr Instagram and YouTube proving particularly popular with teenagers . The research also showed usage rates of Google+, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram and Reddit have all increased, demonstrating how diverse and competitive social networking has become. Use of networking and messaging apps rose strongly too. The estimated audience size for WeChat rose by 379 per cent, with SnapChat increasing its user base by 54 per cent. Video clip network Vine has also more than doubled in popularity. Though more than 50 per cent of active users on the top social platforms are aged between 16 and 34, it is the 25 to 34-year-olds rather than the 16 to 24-year-olds who make up the largest share of users on nearly all of the social networks surveyed. The number of people using social network apps on their phones and tablets is still slightly less than those accessing the websites on their PCs and laptops, but mobile networkers are among the most frequent visitors and active users of the networking services - with iPhone users being particularly engaged.

"The guns used in a 2010 mass murder of mostly young . men and women - came from the U.S. in its failed gun-tracking program known as . Operation Fast and Furious, a shocking report has revealed. It has now been discovered that three of the guns used in the relentless assault came from Fast and Furious, the botched Department of Justice gun-trafficking operation. The Villas de . Salvarcar massacre in January 2010 was one of the darkest days of the Mexican drug war, . after about 20 armed cartel members stormed a birthday party in Ciudad Juarez at about midnight and began . firing at random, killing 16 people. Fourteen of the victims were teenagers. Scroll down for video . Streets running red: Sixteen young people where killed in the Villas de Salvarcar massacre in January 2010 . Bloodbath: A girl walks down the blood-soaked Villa del Portal street in Villas de Salvarcar, in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico . Univision confirmed the information in an official document obtained through a Freedom of Information request. The report, translated by ABC News said that weapons used in the devastating shooting were linked to Fast and Furious through serial numbers. A Justice Department spokesman told MailOnline that the agency is trying to review the Univision report, and 'cannot confirm or deny anything that’s been reported' at this point. The mastermind behind the attack, Drug boss Jose Antonio Acosta Hernandez was sentenced to seven life terms in April for his . role in the birthday party shooting and other acts of murder and . violence that he ordered. Sentencing: With his charges including murder, conspiracy to kill and various racketeering, money laundering and drug charges Jose Antonio Acosta Hernandez was sentenced to seven concurrent life terms and three additional consecutive life terms . Hernandez was a chief in La Linea, an arm of the Juarez Drug Cartel. In a plea agreement, Hernandez confessed to ordering his men to kill members of a rival gang at the birthday party in Ciudad Juarez. He also admitted that he participated in the murder of U.S. consulate employee Arthur Redelfs and his wife and a car bombing that killed four Mexican police officers. In total, Hernandez has been linked to '1,500 murders since 2008,' according to the plea document. A damning September 19 report led two top Department of Justice officials to be ousted from their jobs - but Attorney General Eric Holder was ruled blameless in the gun-trafficking scandal. Two senior officials left the department, one by resignation and one by retirement, upon release of the 471-page internal report. Its author, Inspector General Michael Horowitz, also referred 14 people for possible department disciplinary action for their roles in Operation Fast and Furious and a separate, earlier probe known as Wide Receiver, undertaken during the George W Bush administration. Escape: Attorney General Eric Holder was cleared of any wrongdoing in the Fast and Furious probe, but the report found that he should have been briefed on the investigation . Gunrunners: Some 1,400 of the 2,000 guns lost in Operation Fast and Furious are yet to be recovered . The high risk operation saw guns being allowed to be purchased by Mexican gangsters and Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives agents were supposed to track them to higher level drug cartel members and catch the bigger fish red-handed. But, it backfired and resulted in hundreds of weapons turning up at crime scenes in the U.S. and Mexico. And in the worst failure U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry, who was gunned down in December 2010 with two guns that agents had been trying to track. Terry's murder was the catalyst that began the internal probe into the gun operation after two of the 2,000 weapons thought to have been acquired by illicit buyers were found at the murder scene. About 1,400 of the total are yet to be recovered. No criminal charges were recommended in the report. Victim: U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry was gunned down with one of the weapons used in Operation Fast and Furious in December 2010 . The documents did not criticise Holder, but said lower-level officials should have briefed him about the investigation much earlier. Investigators found that Holder didn't know anything about Fast and Furious until late January/early February and found no evidence that that the attorney general was told about the much-disputed 'gun-walking' tactic employed by the department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The inspector general found fault with the work of the senior ATF leadership, the ATF staff and U.S. attorney's office in Phoenix and senior officials of Justice's criminal division in Washington. He also said that poor internal information-gathering and drafting at Justice and ATF caused the department to initially misinform Congress about Fast and Furious. One of those criticized in the report, former ATF acting director Kenneth Melson, who headed that office during the Fast and Furious investigation, retired upon release of the report. 'Melson made too many assumptions about the case,' the report stated. 'Melson should have asked basic questions about the investigation, including how public safety was being protected.' Another of those criticized, Justice Department career attorney Jason Weinstein, resigned. Weinstein was a deputy assistant attorney general in Justice's criminal division in Washington. 'Weinstein was the most senior person in the department in April and May 2010 who was in a position to identify the similarity between the inappropriate tactics used in Operations Wide Receiver and Fast and Furious,' the report said. Weinstein's lawyer, Michael Bromwich, called the report's criticism 'profoundly wrong' and 'deeply flawed.' Resigned: Deputy Assistant Attorney General Jason Weinstein, the top Justice Department official with the power to stop Operation Fast and Furious . Arsenal: Weapons tied to the gun trafficking operation known Fast and Furious were discovered in April in the home of Jose Antonio Torres Marrufo, in the volatile city of Juarez, Mexico . In Operation Fast and Furious and at least three earlier probes during the administration of George W. Bush, agents in Arizona employed a risky tactic called gun-walking - allowing low-level 'straw' buyers - believed to be working for notorious Mexican drug cartels - to leave with loads of weapons purchased at gun shops. But because of thin ATF staffing and weak penalties, the traditional strategy of arresting suspected straw buyers as soon as possible had failed to stop the flow of tens of thousands of guns to Mexico - more than 68,000 in the past five years. The goal was to track the guns to major weapons traffickers and drug cartels in order to bring cases against kingpins who had long eluded prosecution under the former strategy of arresting low-level purchasers of guns who were suspected of buying them for others. The report also said that poor internal information-gathering and drafting at the Justice Department and ATF caused the department to initially misinform Congress about Fast and Furious. Out: Kenneth Melson, the acting director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives' retired upon the release of the report, which heavily criticised him for assuming too much . Rep Darrell Issa, chairman of the House . Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and vocal critic of the . operation, said: 'The inspector general's report confirms findings by . Congress' investigation of a near total disregard for public safety in . Operation Fast and Furious.' The report's conclusion reads: 'Our . review of Operation Fast and Furious and related matters revealed a . series of misguided strategies, tactics, errors in judgment, and . management failures that permeated ATF Headquarters and the Phoenix . Field Division, as well as the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District . of Arizona.' One of the five suspects in Terry's murder was arrested two weeks ago. Jesus Leonel Sanchez Meza, who was arrested on September 6 in Sonora state. Another suspect is currently on trial, while three more - Jesus Rosario Favela-Astorga, 31, Ivan Soto-Barraza, 34, Heraclio Osorio-Arellanes, 34 - remain at large.

"Mohammed Merah killed three schoolchildren, a rabbi and three paratroopers . Police recordings of the Toulouse gunman while he was under siege suggest he was a psychopath who took 'infinite pleasure' in killing his victims. Islamic extremist Mohammed Merah, 23, murdered seven people including a Rabbi, three children and three soldiers in three seperate scooter-bourne attacks before being shot dead at the end of 32-hour police siege. But during the stand-off following the murders, Merah showed no remorse - and even claimed his only regret was arriving too late to kill more Jews outside the Lycee Ozar Hatorah school. In police recordings of Merah, leaked to a French newspaper, he boasted that the killings gave him 'infinite pleasure'. The Independent reported that Merah said he had no interest in being a suicide bomber and just wanted to 'see' his victims, 'touch them' and 'film them. He told police negotiators he wanted to 'have the honour of dying with a gun in my hand like a mujaheddin'. The French newspaper Journal du Dimanche quoted a police source as saying: 'He wanted to give himself a star role. 'He had a narcissistic need to seem important.' The French-Algerian, a known fundamentalist, had been on a French security service 'watch list' since 2008, was on the U.S. no-fly list, and had attended an al-Qaeda training camp. After the first the series of attacks . he was placed on a list of possible suspects but little was done to . trace him until the Jewish school massacre when he shot a teacher and . his two sons, aged four and five, as well as a seven-year-old girl. Bullet holes line the wall of the apartment of Mohamed Merah, the self-proclaimed Islamic extremist who killed seven people, after a 32-hour siege . Scene: A general view of the block of apartments in which Mohammed Merah was shot by police . Following the murders he resisted . arrest for 32 hours while under siege at his council flat but was killed . by gun wounds in a blazing shoot out with police last Thursday. Merah, who filmed himself carrying out . the executions of four Jewish people and three French soldiers, had . fought in Afghanistan and was a self-styled Jihadist. He said he wanted to kill Jewish . children in revenge for the lives of Palestinian youngsters who had died . at the hands of the Israeli army. Bernard Squarcini, head of French . internal security service, told Le Monde newspaper: 'He (Merah) resembles no other pattern we have seen until now... 'What he did points to a mixture of medical problems and a fanaticism than the usual career of a jihadist.' Merah's brother Abdelkader Merah, 29, . has since appeared before an anti-terrorist judge and formally charged . with ‘complicity in murder’. Victims: Imad Ibn-Ziaten, 30, Abel Chennouf, 25, and Mohamed Legouade, 26 were killed by Merah last week . Tragic: The mother and father of French paratrooper Imad Ben Ziaten carry a portrait of their son as they wait for his body's arrival at Rabat airport . In a statement read out soon . afterwards, the Paris Prosecutor’s Office said: ‘The investigations . being handled by the police have established the existence of serious . evidence against Abdelkader Merah corroborating, or making plausible, . his participation as an accomplice in the commission of crimes in . connection with a terrorist enterprise.’ Adbelkader has already told police . interrogators that he was ‘very proud’ of what Merah did, and admitted . to dining with him just before the attack on the Ozar Hatorah school in . Toulouse. His charging came as his wife, 30-year-old Yamina Mesbah, was freed yesterday after being held for four days by anti-terrorism police. She said she was 'hugely relieved, but concerned about her husband.' The pair married religiously as Muslims in 2006, but had never formally wed civilly, as they would be required to do by French law. Ms Mesrah's lawyer, Guy Debuisson, said that knowledge of Mohammed Mesrah's crimes had been 'like a bomb which exploded infront of her eyes.' Meanwhile, Merah is being held up as . an martyr in some quarters, with Jewish cemeteries targeted in attacks . which police are linking to the Merah atrocities. Riot police have also been called to . housing estates on the outskirts of major cities like Paris because of . anti-Semitic demonstrations being held in support of the 23-year-old . killer. There are some 500,000 Jews in France, . and security measures around them have increased after Merah shot a . rabbi and three children at a school in Toulouse last Monday. There are some six million Muslims . living in France, making up the largest group of its kind in western . Europe, but Islamic leaders have rejected Merah as being utterly . unrepresentative of a largely peace-loving and law-abiding community. The . girlfriend of one of Merah’s victims said she intended to marry her . partner in a posthumous ceremony. Caroline . Monet, 21, has been given presidential permission to wed 25-year-old . Corporal Abel Chennouf, who was shot dead at a cash machine in the town . of Montauban, near Toulouse, this month. Her lawyer, Gilbert Collard, said Ms Monet had received approval from President Nicolas Sarkozy for the ceremony to take place. Corporal Abel Chennouf, left, was shot dead by Merah. His girlfriend Caroline Money, right, has been given permission to wed him posthumously . Posthumous marriages are unusual in France, but they can be sanctioned in ‘grave circumstances’, said Mr Collard. 'I’ve already had it done twice, for policemen’s girlfriends,' he said. 'It’s a really moving ceremony with an empty chair representing the dead spouse. 'There won’t be any problems with approval, and the marriage will allow the new child to have a father.'

Leonhart supposedly told a recent closed-door sheriff’s conference that she isn’t happy with the federal government’s willingness to allow states to legalize the plant. Leonhart expressed her frustration with . the country’s increasingly relaxed attitude towards marijuana in the . wake of President Obama recently telling the New Yorker he doesn’t think . it’s dangerous. Acting DEA Administrator Michele Leonhart, pictured at a 2009 news conference, is upset with President Obama over recent moves to allow marijuana legalization . She’s frustrated for the same reasons we are, Bristol County Sheriff Thomas M. Hodgson told the Boston Herald. “She said she felt the administration didn’t understand the science enough to make those statements. ‘She [also] said her lowest point in 33 years in . the DEA was when she learned they’d flown a hemp flag over the Capitol . on July 4,’ Hodgson continued. ‘The sheriffs were all shocked, this is the first time in 28 years I’ve ever heard anyone in her position be this candid.' She was also infuriated that the White House played a softball game with a ‘pro-legalization group,’ Hodgson added. Her pot shots at the president were not made in public, but they came after recent comments he made to the New Yorker raised more than a few eyebrows. ‘I view it as a bad habit and a vice, . not very different from the cigarettes that I smoked as a young person . up through a big chunk of my adult life,’ said the President. ‘I . don’t think it is more dangerous than alcohol,’ he continued, adding . that he believes it is even less damaging ‘in terms of its impact on the . individual consumer.’ The flag was flown at the urging of Colorado Rep Jared Polis (D) and made of industrial hemp. It was not illegal. Under fire: President Barack Obama makes remarks at a Thursday reception, he is being criticized by the head of the DEA for his relaxed attitude towards marijuana . The Obama Administration announced last summer it would no longer seek to stop states from legalizing recreational marijuana. The President's evolving stance may just be a reflection of the country as a whole – almost 60 per cent of American’s are in favour of legalization, according to Gallup – but that doesn’t sit well with Leonhart. ‘This is a woman who has spent 33 years of her life fighting drug abuse in the DEA, her entire life,’ Kern County, Calif., Sheriff Donny Youngblood explained. ‘To have the president of the United States publicly say marijuana was a bad habit like alcohol was appalling to everyone in that room. ‘I think the way that she felt was that . it was a betrayal of what she does for the American people in enforcing . our drug laws. ... She got a standing ovation,’ he added. Rep. Jared Polis, (D-CO)nbholds an American flag made of hemp on the floor of the House of Representatives last year . Authorities have long contended marijuana is a gateway drug that leads to more serious addictions like cocaine, heroin and more, Hodgson explained. Having the President make those remarks sends children mixed signals. ‘The last person we need saying this to kids is the president of the United States.’ A source told the Herald Leonhart may lose her job over the comments, but a spokesperson made an attempt to clarify them in an email to the Huffington Post. 'With regards to the Herald story, I think its important to clarify that the Administrator's remarks were not at against the President, as the story portrays, but continued messages that the DEA is not in support of legalization -- and neither is the Administration.'","DEA head Michele Leonhart is infuriated by President Obama telling the New Yorker that marijuana is less harmless than alcohol .

"An acquaintance of the Colorado 'Dark Knight' gunman has been questioned by police over a phone threat to have the shooter released from jail. Yeom Pyo Lee was sought by officials after police received a message from his telephone threatening violence if James Holmes was not released from police custody. Lee, who is believed to be a student on the PhD course at the University of Colorado, Denver from which Holmes recently dropped out, was released without charge after questioning. Questioned: Yeom Pyo Lee, left, a classmate of Colorado shooter James Holmes, right, was sought by police . He came to the attention of the police when 'someone called from [his] phone and threatened violence if Holmes is not released', according to KDVR reporter Justin Joseph. It is not known whether or not Lee was responsible for the communication. His neighbours in Aurora said that there was a heavy police presence around the street where he lives, and officers repeatedly questioned residents as to his whereabouts. Police finally talked to him on Saturday evening, but after the interview released a statement saying, 'There is no reason to believe that he is involved.' Tribute: The crosses erected near the site of the massacre in memory of Holmes's 12 victims . Memories: Mourners watch over the floral tributes placed by the impromptu memorials . Several sources have referred to Lee as a 'person of interest', but local police chief Daniel Oates told CBS: 'I'm not quite sure what the term person of interest means. 'This was a person who had contact with the suspect, a casual acquaintance. We found him yesterday, we interviewed him.' He added: 'The relationship was really inconsequential and we're happy that we spoke to him. That's all that was. 'As a responsible part of this investigation we would be doing that with any of his acquaintances.' Massacre: 12 people were left dead and 58 injured in the Colorado shooting . Lee, who is originally from South Korea, earned a master's degree in biomedical science from Hallym University, a private college in the city of Chuncheon, before moving to Colorado to study for his doctorate. His Twitter profile reads: 'Like: YOU. CAMERA. APPLE. MOTOR VEHICLE. MUSIC. STEVE JOBS. Dislike: HYPOCRITE.' He tweets prolifically about technology, which appears to be his principal interest. Police have been unable to confirm a motive for Holmes, who killed 12 people and injured 58 during a midnight screening of The Dark Knight Rises early on Friday morning. Early reports seem to indicate he acted alone, although one witness said he thought he saw someone prop open the emergency exit of the cinema ahead of Holmes's murderous assault. Witness: This man claims to have seen someone . leave the emergency exit of the cinema open for Holmes near the . beginning of the film . The . witness said: 'As I was sitting down to get my seat, I noticed that a . person came up to the front row, the front right, sat down, and as . credits were going, it seemed like he got a phone call. 'So . he went out toward the emergency exit doorway, which I thought was . unusual to take a phone call. And it seemed like he probably pried it . open, or probably did not let it latch all the way. 'As . soon as the movie started, somebody came in, all black, gas mask, . armour, and threw a gas can into the audience, and it went off, and then . there were gunshots that took place.' Mr Oates, however, said that police were still acting on the assumption that Holmes did not have an accomplice. 'All . the evidence we have, every single indicator, is that this was all Mr . Holmes's activity,' the police chief said. 'He wasn't particularly aided by anyone else.'","Threat to police received from Yeom Pyo Lee's phone .

"Three in four petrol stations have closed in the last 40 years, leaving drivers with longer journeys to fill up their tanks. An official report ordered by ministers also warns that less competition is driving up prices as motorists hit with the highest prices at the pumps in history. With prices still soaring as family incomes are squeezed, more and more people are now driving further in search of cheaper fuel. Most people have a petrol station (PFS) within a five minute drive, but in some rural areas the nearest forecourt is 20 or even 30 minutes away . MPs expressed alarm at the scale of the closures and claimed it added to claims of price-fixing at the pumps. Ministers commissioned a major study . into the scale of forecourt closures amid concern about the impact of . ‘fuel deserts’ on motorists. Energy minister John Hayes has now . ordered officials to work with the industry and retailers to ‘ensure . motorist always have a ready and secure supply of fuel’. In 1970 there were 37,539 petrol stations in the UK but by 2012 the number had fallen dramatically by 75 per cent to 8,677. Ministers demanded the study to uncover the scale of the closures, which saw the number of petrol stations slump from 37,539 in 1970 to 8,677 in 2012 . In the decade to 2011 alone 29 per . cent of forecourts shut. Yorkshire and Humber was hardest hit, losing 33 . per cent of stations from 2001-11, followed by London 32 per cent and . the South West 31 per cent. The ‘closures had a negative impact on . access’ to petrol stations by ‘increasing the minimum driving time . required to reach the nearest’ forecourt in some areas, the government . report by consultants Deloitte said. ‘These closures also reduced the number of… options available to consumers within a 10 minute driving time in some areas.’ Supermarkets have massively increased . their market share, often offering cheaper deals to shoppers but . squeezing out independent retailers and limiting choice. Who owns what: The major supermarket brands increasingly dominate the market, although MP still owns 14 per cent of all petrol stations . Supermarkets now own 14 per cent of . petrol stations, up from 9 per cent in 2001, but sell 40 per cent of all . road fuel, putting pressure on competitors. Oil companies have lost market share, with Tesco recently overtaking BP as the largest retailer in terms of fuel volumes sold. Supermarkets forecourts also tend to . have smaller stocks to meet demand, so are less able to cope if supplies . are disrupted. 'This may have a detrimental impact on resilience,’ the . report warned. ‘Some consumers may be prepared to travel a considerable distance to purchase fuel at a lower price. In 2009 almost 60 per cent of drivers . said they filled their car where it was convenient rather than cheap, . but three years later that figure has slumped to 40 per cent as . hard-pressed drivers hunt for bargains. Supermarket takeover: Tesco now sells more petrol each year than BP . Tory MP Robert Halfon, who has campaigned on petrol prices, said: ‘I am alarmed at the decline in petrol stations. ‘Britain is being taken for a very expensive ride by some of these oil companies, who are crushing the independent retailers. ‘I hope that the Government will use . this report to add ammunition to the OFT study into allegations of . price-fixing at the pumps.’ Tory MP Robert Halfon said he was 'alarmed' at the decline in petrol stations . The report warned that in the worst . affect areas ‘if there are any short-term supply disruptions, consumers . may not only face longer driving times to access the nearest [petrol . station] but in the event that the nearest has run out of fuel they may . have to travel even longer. ‘Besides short-term supply . disruptions, there might also be wider competition effects from closures . in such areas, potentially resulting in consumers being faced with . higher prices due to their reduced ability to substitute between . different [petrol stations]. The loss of petrol stations is felt acutely in rural areas, where people already have to travel further to reach vital services. Official figures show someone living . in the countryside has to travel for 12 minutes to reach their local . hospital compared to just eight minutes in urban areas. Some drivers now have to travel for . more than 10 minutes and in some cases more than 20 minutes to reach . their nearest petrol station. A combination of the recession and more economical vehicles meant petrol demand in 2011 was just below 1970 levels. Energy minister John Hayes said he . wanted to get ‘an accurate picture’ of the scale of the closures to . ‘consider any possible implications for our security of supply’. He said the closures had not had ‘an . impact on the vast majority of motorists’ but he added: ‘My officials . will be working  with industry, trade associations and other government . departments to ensure motorist always have a ready and secure supply of . fuel. ‘This report will help inform our . further work here, as will the findings of OFT’s Call for Information . into this sector, due in January 2013.’ The government had frozen fuel . duty for two and a half years and a review of business rates had been . postponed to prevent ‘significant business rate hikes for forecourts’, . he added.","Just 8,600 forecourts left in the UK, down from 37,500 in 1970 .

"Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov will pay the national federation's debt to coach Fabio Capello, who has gone unpaid since June, Russian agency R-Sport reported on Thursday. Usmanov, a shareholder at Arsenal, was quoted as saying he will loan 400 million rubles (£3.9million) to the Russian Football Union to pay Capello. 'It is a disgrace when a person who's working for Russia doesn't get paid for his labour,' Usmanov said in comments reported by R-Sport, which said he agreed to pay after talks with Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko. Russia boss Fabio Capello has not been paid by the Russian Football Union since June . It was not immediately clear how the RFU, which has repeatedly said it lacks the funds to pay Capello, would be able to pay back the loan to Usmanov, or how it would afford future wage payments to Capello, who was contracted through 2018. The issue has become an embarrassment for Russia, the host of the 2018 World Cup. 'What can be more important now than worthy play by our national team in our motherland?' Usmanov asked. 'The team should have all the necessary conditions for proper preparations created for it.' Arsenal shareholder Alisher Usmanov has lent money for them to pay Capello . Usmanov, 61, said a condition of his loan was that it could be used only to pay the Italian coach, 68. A representative of Capello did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Capello has insisted the unpaid money is not a factor in Russia's poor form, with just one win in its last eight competitive matches, including a winless group-stage exit at the World Cup in Brazil. The involvement of Uzbekistan-born Usmanov has precedent in Russia, of a high-profile foreign football coach being paid by a wealthy benefactor rather than the RFU: The wages Guus Hiddink, the coach from 2006-10, were largely covered by billionaire Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich. Italian manager Capello was England boss for between 2008- 2012, taking them to the World Cup in 2010 .","Alisher Usmanov to pay Russia federation's debt to Fabio Capello .

"Speak to the viewers like they're 10. That's the trick Alistair Darling's media handler likely taught him before his TV tour de force in the Scottish Independence debate. Scott Chisholm, a former Sky News presenter turned media trainer, reportedly coached the former Labour cabinet minister for his debating clash with Scots First Minister Alex Salmond. Commentators called the clash a decisive win for the No campaign, with the Mail's Stephen Glover writing glowingly of the once widely-mocked Mr Darling as an 'energised' and 'battle-hardened' political operator. Seconds out... Alex Salmond, First Minister of Scotland and Alistair Darling, chairman of Better Together take part in a live television debate hosted by Bernard Ponsonby at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland on August 5 . 'Strikingly impressive performance': Commentators widely backed Mr Darling as the debate's surprise winner . Today The Times reports that Mr Chisholm is 'fast emerging as the assistant of choice for top politicians'. A . so-called no-nonsense bruiser who began his career as a print . journalist in New Zealand in the 1970s, Mr Chisholm went on to be part . of the original Sky News team when the channel launched in 1989. He . is a veteran journalist who also presented the breakfast show on the . ill-fated ITN News Channel and even sports a Ron Burgundy-style . moustache. Now, . as gamekeeper turned poacher, so to speak, he coaches those who want to . get the message across into the media with one simple, central message: . 'Pitch it at a ten-year-old.' Ron Burgundy-style moustache: Scott Chisholm, the newsman turned media trainer who is believed to have coached Darling for his appearance . 'If you use words that viewers have to process in order to understand, then they will miss the next three to six words you say.' That . strategy believed to have guided Mr Darling to his unexpected victory . over the wily Mr Salmond in the recent televised Scottish Independence . debate. 'For . a man with a reputation as a dry-as-dust bank manager, Alistair Darling . mounted a strikingly impressive performance,' commented a Daily Mail . editorial following the face-off. 'In . two hours of vigorous argument, the former chancellor dismantled Alex . Salmond’s case for independence, leaving him blustering and deflated.' Well like among politicians for his discretion, Mr Chisholm last night refused to comment when asked by The Times if he had worked with Mr Darling. He responded similarly when, following Nick Clegg's unexpected Leaders' Debate coup in 2010, rumours spread that he had worked his magic on the leader of the Liberal Democrats. But while his clients list is a closely guarded secret, his words of wisdom are more widely reported. In a PR Week seminar in 2010 he told clients to stick to simple language. 'Even the FT uses language that could be understood by a literate 12-year-old, and the tabloids aim for a reading age of about eight or nine,' he was quoted as saying by the industry magazine. 'Think about that when you are talking to a print journalist.' And he stressed the importance of capturing audiences' imaginations. '""Imagine"" is the most powerful word you can use in an interview,' he said. 'If you just inform people, they will forget the message. Bear in mind the other two Reithian principles - educate and entertain - and they are far more like to recall it.'","Former Labour Chancellor was coached by ex-journalist Scott Chisholm .

"The BBC has enraged licence fee-payers by allegedly downplaying the role of Pakistani gangs in Rotherham's sex abuse scandal. Yesterday's landmark report singled out Pakistani men as the main perpetrators in the sexual exploitation of at least 1,400 children over 16 years  - and warned council staff's fear of acknowledging their race compounded the scandal. But this morning, four of  BBC News Online's seven articles on the report made no reference to Pakistani men. Scroll down for video . 'Sanitised': The BBC's website has been accused of downplaying the role of Pakistanis in Rotherham's abuse scandal. Yesterday's report singled out Pakistanis as the main perpetrators and warned of a fear of racism . Blasting the BBC's omission as 'spineless and gutless', Jane Collins, Ukip's Yorkshire and Humber MEP, told MailOnline: 'Are they worried about being racist? 'There is no way around it: the people involved in this scandal were from the Pakistani and Kahmiri communities. 'We have to be brave. It's not about racism, it's about welfare. 'Unfortunately the people involved in this worried about being called racist. We have to face up to that fact and tackle this head-on in the community.' Professor Alexis Jay, author of the council-commissioned report, highlighted political correctness as a key factor in the long-running scandal. She warned police and council officials suppressed evidence of the crimes because they feared being labelled racist. Concerns about damage to community cohesion were put above the need to protect the vulnerable, the report said. Readers took to social media in anger accusing the Corporation of sanitising its online coverage. Reference was made to Pakistani men in the BBC's evening news broadcasts and this morning's radio. However, the lead articles online this morning simply referred to the perpetrators as 'criminal gangs'. One commenter tweeted: 'BBC unable to even say ""Pakistani"" & point fingers. If your name is Cliff Richard however, they'll send a TV helicopter. #rotherham'. Another said: 'The reference to perpetrators being virtually all Pakistani has been removed from the BBC piece #Rotherham'. And one wrote: 'Main BBC News website story on #Rotherham does not mention Asian/Pakistani once, they are ""criminal gangs""'. The report stated: 'The issue of race, regardless of ethic group, should be tackled as an absolute priority if it is known to be a significant factor in the criminal activity of organised abuse in any local community.' Report: Professor Alexis Jay warned officers had failed to speak out for fear of being seen as racist . Council staff were given ‘clear directions’ from managers to downplay the ‘ethnic dimension’ of the abuse despite almost all the perpetrators being of Pakistani heritage. Three separate reports warning of the scale of the abuse were ‘suppressed or ignored’ by the council because it was ‘in denial’ about the crimes. Despite the appalling failures in the case, no one in authority has been sacked or even disciplined. MPs and charities said the scale of the abuse was almost ‘incomprehensible’ and called for a criminal investigation into those who helped cover it up. And at least six victims have now launched a class action against Rotherham council and could be in line for millions of pounds in compensation. A BBC spokesman said: 'Any suggestion we’ve sanitised our reporting is nonsense. 'Our coverage on BBC News, including online, has made it clear that the abusers were predominately Asian and that council staff feared being labelled racist. 'Stories on the website are constantly evolving but all have clear links to articles which explain the full context. 'We spoke to members of the Pakistani community in Rotherham on Today, BBC Radio 5 live, the BBC News Channel and more reaction is expected online later. 'As the story has evolved we have covered other key developments such as the resignation of the council leader and calls for the resignation of South Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner and we’ll continue to explore all the different angles.'","Report found 1,400 children abused between 1997 and 2013 in Rotherham .

"The Met Office is the unlucky recipient of a booby prize for its baffling use of 'gobbledygook' at an awards ceremony. The weather service has been singled out during the Plain English Campaign Awards for its jargon-filled description of a new style of weather forecast it introduced in November. The Met Office said the forecast aims to 'empower people to make their own decisions' by using the 'probabilities of precipitation'. Confusing? The new American-style system gives the percentage chances of precipitation, rather than telling people that rain will be 'likely' or 'very likely' The new American-style system gives the percentage chances of precipitation, rather than telling people that rain will be 'likely' or 'very likely'. The awards are organised by the Plain English Campaign, a pressure group based in Derbyshire which aims to persuade many UK and worldwide organisations to communicate with the public in plain language. It fights bureaucratic language, small print and the legalese of official information. A Met Office spokesman said: 'The word precipitation has a specific meaning and by using it we are helping the nation to learn useful weather terms in a subject we talk about every day. 'Precipitation covers a wide range of stuff falling from the sky including rain, sleet, snow, hail, drizzle and even cats and dogs - but sums it up in just one word.' Among other winners of the infamous Golden Bull booby prize is the British Fencing Association, which says on its website it 'will innovate to ensure that we are successful on the piste'. Jargon: The Met Office said precipitation covers a wide range of stuff falling from the sky including rain, sleet, snow, hail, drizzle but sums it up in one word . The Office for National Statistics also scooped an award for the listing on its website of 'Standard Industrial Classifications' that businesses must identify, one of which is 'activities of extraterritorial organisations'. The ceremony, which coincides with National Plain English Day, is held at the Cavern Club, Liverpool, and features guest speaker Pauline Daniels, a comedian from the city. Chrissie Maher, founder of the Plain English Campaign, said: 'I wanted the campaign to give people the confidence to push back on the growing mountain of confusion and meaningless language in public information. 'The success of the campaign can be seen in the clearer information provided by many organisations over the years. 'But even though most people agree that plain English is plain common sense, our government needs to make it a legal duty that public communications are crystal-clear.' Several organisations were being presented with awards for their use of clear and concise English. Channel 4's Fact Check blog (www.blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/) and the website of Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust (www.jostrust.org.uk) - an organisation which supports women affected by cervical cancer - have been singled out for their jargon-free information.",Met Office says it is 'helping the nation learn useful weather terms'

"More than 500 of the world’s most prominent writers and authors, including five Nobel literature laureates, have added their signatures to an open appeal calling for an end to the NSA spying program. The appeal - A Stand For Democracy In The Digital Age - is against all widespread ‘mass surveillance’ by governments and corporations and comes hot on the heels of eight of the world’s largest technology companies, including Facebook and Google, urging Barack Obama and other leaders to rein in internet surveillance. The NSA surveillance is a systematic abuse of power, claim the writers, and an attack on ‘a basic pillar of democracy... the inviolable integrity of the individual’. New York-based Danish writer Janne Teller helped organize the petition, while American writer and performance poet Sapphire is amongst the 560 signatures . ‘In their thoughts and in their personal environments and communications all humans have the right to remain unobserved and unmolested,’ the appeal argues. ‘This fundamental human right has been rendered null and void through abuse of technological developments by states and corporations for mass surveillance purposes. 'Surveillance violates the private sphere and compromises freedom of thought and opinion. Mass surveillance treats every citizen as a potential suspect. It overturns one of our historical triumphs: the presumption of innocence.’ Among the ‘writers against mass surveillance’ from some 80 countries are the Nobel laureates Orhan Pamuk, JM Coetzee, Elfriede Jelinek, Günter Grass and Tomas Tranströmer. Other notable signers include Richard Ford, Margaret Atwood, Umberto Eco, Yann Martel, Dave Eggers, Colum McCann, Sapphire, Ian McEwan, and Don DeLillo. The appeal comes in the wake of recent revelations by whistleblower Edward Snowden exposing extensive and intrusive telephone and internet surveillance by the U.S. and its western allies. The 'writers against mass surveillance' group consists of 560 writers, including five Nobel literature laureates, from 80 countries . Other notable signers of the petition include Canadian authors Yann Martel, left, and Margaret Atwood . It was organized by an independent international group of authors Juli Zeh, Ilija Trojanow, Eva Menasse, Janne Teller, Priya Basil, Isabel Cole, Josef Haslinger – though personal contacts and private networks. The appeal calls for the drafting by the U.N. of an International Bill of Digital Rights and on governments to sign and adhere to such a convention. ‘We are really very worried about mass surveillance. We think it's undermining democracy totally, and we are shocked that more people aren't up in arms about it,’ said Danish writer Janne Teller. Teller said she doesn't believe writers are threatened more than ordinary citizens by mass surveillance, but their work makes them particularly attuned to its dangers. ‘I think it's quite significant when you have 560 or so of the greatest contemporary writers, from all across the world, expressing a very serious concern, because these are people who always work on the big philosophical questions of life,’ Teller said. ‘Hopefully their concern matters to politicians.’ A recent survey by PEN found American writers are increasingly fearful of government surveillance in the wake of Edward Snowden's revelations about the NSA and have even started to self-censor . A recent survey by the writers' rights group PEN found American writers are increasingly fearful of government surveillance in the wake of Snowden's revelations about the NSA and have even started to self-censor their work. Eighty-five percent of PEN's American members are worried about government surveillance, the group's report found. Twenty-eight percent of PEN's members have curbed their social media use, 24 percent are avoiding certain topics in phone and email conversations, and 16 percent have avoided writing or speaking about issues, the survey found. Writers reported being fearful about discussing military affairs, the Middle East North Africa region, mass incarceration, drug policies, pornography, the Occupy movement, the study of certain languages, and criticism of the U.S. government. Teller, who lives in New York, said she hopes Americans will join the writers' outrage over mass surveillance by adding their names to a public version of the appeal. 'This undermines all the freedoms and values that I otherwise love about America,' Teller said. 'So I can't understand why Americans can accept mass surveillance in this way, it's totally against the freedom ideals.' The organizers are inviting others to sign the petition at www.change.org/surveillance. In recent months, the extent of mass surveillance has become common knowledge. With a few clicks of the mouse the state can access your mobile device, your e-mail, your social networking and internet searches. It can follow your political leanings and activities and, in partnership with internet corporations, it collects and stores your data, and thus can predict your consumption and behavior. The basic pillar of democracy is the inviolable integrity of the individual. Human integrity extends beyond the physical body. In their thoughts and in their personal environments and communications, all humans have the right to remain unobserved and unmolested. This fundamental human right has been rendered null and void through abuse of technological developments by states and corporations for mass surveillance purposes. A person under surveillance is no longer free; a society under surveillance is no longer a democracy. To maintain any validity, our democratic rights must apply in virtual as in real space. WE DEMAND THE RIGHT for all people, as democratic citizens, to determine to what extent their personal data may be collected, stored and processed, and by whom; to obtain information on where their data is stored and how it is being used; to obtain the deletion of their data if it has been illegally collected and stored. WE CALL ON ALL STATES AND CORPORATIONS to respect these rights. WE CALL ON ALL CITIZENS to stand up and defend these rights. WE CALL ON THE UNITED NATIONS to acknowledge the central importance of protecting civil rights in the digital age, and to create an International Bill of Digital Rights. WE CALL ON GOVERNMENTS to sign and adhere to such a convention.","Global group of prominent writers have joined forces to speak out about widespread surveillance including NSA scandal .

"Louis van Gaal insists that Wayne Rooney is happy playing in midfield for Manchester United but may well reinstate the England captain as a striker in future. There are concerns that Rooney is in danger of becoming disillusioned with a deeper role that limits his goalscoring opportunities. He has not managed a shot on goal this calendar year. But Van Gaal maintains his skipper is happy to do a job for the team and provide balance in midfield in the absence of better options. Wayne Rooney has looked out of place playing in midfield under Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal . ‘He’s happy,’ said the United boss. ‘Otherwise he should come to me and say he’s not. He never does. He’s always friendly to me. He wants to perform what I want so that’s what I see. ‘When the whole world is writing he has to be in the striker’s position, he will be thinking “maybe”. He’s human. ‘But I’m looking for balance and I need it in midfield. The last games I played with Adnan Januzaj and Angel Di Maria in midfield. Then you need a certain balance for those kind of creative players.’ Louis van Gaal is targeting FA Cup glory in his first season in charge at Manchester United . Rooney, in action against Burnley playing in midfield, will look to help his side beat Preston in the FA Cup . However, Van Gaal acknowledges that Rooney may still be his ‘best striker’ and could play him up front again if he can sign a midfielder this summer. Asked if that is a priority following talks with United’s owners, Van Gaal said: ‘Of course. Maybe, he (Rooney) is the best striker but I have to look at where a player can make the biggest contribution, and compare that to other players. ‘The composition of the team is more important than the individual. I am sorry but that’s the way it is.’ Rooney's heat map against Burnley shows that he spent the majority of the game behind the halfway line .","Wayne Rooney has found himself playing in midfield under Louis van Gaal .
