Celebrating with her former lesbian lover as they receive a £10,000 lottery win, this is ‘monster’ mother Rebecca Shuttleworth just months after beating her young son to death. Footage of the moment she whooped with delight at the prize emerged yesterday as the ‘cruel and vicious’ 25-year-old was sentenced to life in prison. She had subjected two-year-old Keanu Williams to months of horrific cruelty and was ordered to serve at least 18 years. No shame: Rebecca Shuttleworth, centre, opens her mouth in delight as her former partner, left, receives a lottery win . Just eight months after his death, a two-minute video posted on YouTube by the People’s Postcode Lottery shows her hugging and kissing a former partner as a cheque is handed over. Shuttleworth smiles as radio personality Judie McCourt discusses the pair’s plans to spend the winnings on home improvements and a holiday. The pair later separated and Shuttleworth was seen attending court with another woman she described as her partner. A family friend yesterday hit out at the mother’s ‘sickening’ decision to celebrate in public after her son’s death. ‘It turned people’s stomachs to see her so happy after the terrible things she’d done,’ the friend said. ‘She was whooping and celebrating without a scrap of guilt. She deserves to rot in hell.’ Innocent: Keanu Williams, pictured,  plays with a bucket of water, and died on January 9 2011 after being admitted to hospital with multiple injuries . Shocking: A a body map details the harrowing injuries sustained by Keanu Williams . Brutal: The jury in his mother's trial heard that the two-year-old sustained 37 separated injuries to his body when discovered by paramedics . Denial: Rebecca Shuttleworth and Luke Southerton, pictured together in the dock of Birmingham Crown Court, both denied murder. She was found guilty, he was cleared . Shuttleworth, described by police as ‘a monster’, was sentenced at . Birmingham Crown Court after being found guilty of murder and child . cruelty. Mr Justice Spencer told the weeping . child killer: ‘One can scarcely imagine the pain and distress Keanu must . have suffered from this outburst of violence.’ Of the child, he added: ‘He was a . delightful little boy described as a real character, a little . entertainer who remained cheerful despite everything. Joyful was the word that more than . one witness used to describe him – he was a favourite at nursery as well . as within the family.’ The judge said Shuttleworth, who had had a troubled upbringing and spent time in care, had shown a ‘cruel and vicious’ streak. Crime scene: Police and forensic officers the area around the flat in Birmingham where Keanu Williams was found dead . Hellish: Pictured is the bed where Keanu Williams, who was discovered by paramedics with 37 separate injuries on his body, would sleep . Keanu died of internal bleeding in . January 2011 after being beaten over 48 hours at the Birmingham flat of . Shuttleworth’s then partner, Luke Southerton, 32. There were 37 signs of injury on his body, including a fractured skull. Southerton was cleared of murder, . manslaughter and causing the death of a child, but convicted of cruelty . and given a nine-month suspended jail term. As Shuttleworth wept in the dock, the . judge added: 'By the jury's verdict, you alone were responsible for the . violence which led to Keanu's death. 'One can scarcely imagine the pain and distress Keanu must have suffered from this outburst of violence. 'He . must have been terrified, it must have been clear to you as soon as the . violence had taken place that Keanu was badly in need of medical . attention.' Shuttleworth had decided not to seek . medical help because she knew his injuries, including internal bleeding . to his abdomen, could not be explained away, the judge said. Explaining how he had arrived at the 18-year minimum term, the judge said the murder was aggravated by several factors. Outlining . some of the aggravating features of the case, the judge told . Shuttleworth: 'Keanu was particularly vulnerable because of his age. 'His was a lingering death over many hours following a brutal assault by his own mother. 'This . was the grossest abuse of a position of trust - you were his mother and . it was your most basic and natural duty to protect him. 'I accept that there was no intention to kill but this was a brutal and sustained attack.' A review has . begun into why social workers failed to spot the abuse. Keanu’s injuries were not ‘isolated’ but part of a long chain of abuse by his mother, who now faces life behind bars. Yet Shuttleworth, 25, had duped officials into thinking she was ‘caring and competent’. It adds to questions about children’s . services at Labour-run Birmingham City Council, rated ‘inadequate’ since . 2009 after deaths of children known to social workers. Cases include . that of seven-year-old Khyra Ishaq, starved to death in 2008. Last month the department was labelled ‘utter chaos’ by members of its own watchdog. Yesterday Jane Held, head of the . Birmingham Safeguarding Children Board, which is reviewing Keanu’s . death, said social services, medics and police ‘missed a significant . number of opportunities to intervene’. Catalogue of injuries: Rebecca Shuttleworth was convicted of murdering her two-year-old son after subjecting him to savage and sustained abuse, the injuries resulting from which where detailed at Birmingham Crown Court . Sustained abuse: Keanu was taken to hospital with burns and blisters on his foot, but his mother said it was from a radiator he slept near, which was accepted by police and health workers . Birmingham Crown Court heard that Shuttleworth had ‘resented’ Keanu virtually from his birth in 2008. Shuttleworth, who was living with . Keanu’s father in Torquay, Devon, saw the child as an ‘obstruction to . living her life as she wanted’, the jury was told. Keanu Williams' family has been 'torn apart' by his death, according to his aunt. Angela Shuttleworth, 26, Rebecca Shuttleworth's sister, said the death of the toddler who was known in the family as Kiwi had left 'a gaping hole in our lives'. In a statement she said: 'Keanu was an amazing little boy who had developed a real personality. 'He was full of life and loved playing with his siblings and cousins. He enjoyed all his toys and would empty the toy box every time he came to play, but he especially loved Iggle Piggle from (children's television programme) In The Night Garden . 'Kiwi also loved food - he ate everything and was hungry all the time.' She added: 'Since the tragic death of Kiwi, we haven't been able to grieve or say goodbye to him properly. 'The whole family has been torn apart by this and his death has left a gaping hole in our lives. 'We hope now this is over we can lay Kiwi to rest and begin to have some closure.' Prosecutor Christopher Hotten QC said . she spent much of her childhood in care as her alcoholic mother . struggled to cope, giving her ‘considerable experience of the care . system’. Following Keanu’s birth she received . ‘extensive’ support from health and social workers, posing as an . ‘attentive’ mother at parenting classes. She moved back to her home city of Birmingham when Keanu was 15 months old, starting a relationship with Southerton. Mr Hotten said Shuttleworth used her . knowledge of the care system to ‘manipulate social workers, teachers, . doctors and care professionals to believe that she was a competent and . caring mother’. She told staff at the child’s nursery his bruises came . from bumps or falls. In December 2010, she took Keanu to hospital with burned feet, which she claimed came from a radiator beside his bed. She was told police would inspect her home, and texted Southerton to make sure their stories matched up. A month later, paramedics found the . boy dead at the flat in the deprived Ward End suburb. The couple had . dialled 999, claiming Keanu had had a heart attack. Mr Hotten told the . jury Shuttleworth hoped he would ‘get better’ and only called 999 when . she realised it was hopeless. Detective Chief Inspector Caroline . Marsh, who led the investigation for West Midlands Police, said: ‘In the . past, I have described her as a monster and perhaps I would stand by . that.’ The force would not comment on its prior involvement in the case because of the review.","Rebecca Shuttleworth, 25, went on camera with former girlfriend in Manchester .

A British fitness instructor plunged to his death from a high-rise building in Dubai less than three months after getting married. Former Royal Navy sailor Elwood McIlwraith, 29, who described himself as a 'massive sports player and into everything from football to athletics', fell from the 42-storey Laguna Tower in Jumeirah Lakes Towers district. The exact circumstances surrounding his death early on Saturday morning remain shrouded in mystery and it is not clear if he lived in the building where he fell. Dubai police are investigating. Just married: British fitness instructor Elwood McIlwraith, pictured with his wife Susie on their wedding day in February, plunged to his death from the 42-storey Laguna Tower in Dubai's Jumeirah Lakes Towers district . Mr McIlwraith, from Kingston-upon-Hull, East Yorkshire, had just married his partner Susie on February 21 this year. Both he and his wife have a picture of their wedding day on their Facebook profile page. The devastated widow is now being comforted by colleagues from his gym, Smart Fitness, where he had worked for about two years. The muscly fitness coach, who specialised in training women to high levels of fitness, joined the Royal Navy after leaving school and remained in the military for five years, serving in the Gulf for nine months in 2005. Investigation: The circumstances surrounding Mr McIlwraith's death remain mysterious and it is not clear if he lived in the building where he fell . While in the military he had had played a number of sports and completed a diploma in fitness training in Australia. On one of a number of videos posted on YouTube, he said: 'Since then, I have been a personal trainer and never looked back. 'I get a good result with female clients. I'm a no-nonsense person when it comes to training but at the same time, I make it fun.' Last August he poignantly wrote on Facebook: 'You have on average 28,000 days on this planet. 'Live every day to the fullest. Never regret anything, learn from it and move on. Don't put off things till tomorrow, make that change today. 'Life is too short.' Mr McIlwraith's fatal fall is the third of its kind in as many months in Dubai involving British expats. Last month Emirates airline stewardess Evelyn Clarke, 30, fell to her death from a tall building. And Abbie Emmett, 27, plunged from the window of her fourth-floor honeymoon suite after a night out with her new husband, motorcycle champion Sean Emmett, 43. Mr McIlwraith moved to Dubai two years ago and began working at Smart Fitness shortly after it opened. His colleagues were left shocked by his sudden death. 'He was a very popular guy and got good results with his clients,' said one. 'We can only think this has been a tragic accident. There is no other reason for it. 'He was deliriously happy in his work and with his wife.' In a statement, the company, which is located in the same Jumeirah Lakes Towers district where Mr Elwood died, said: 'On Saturday, we lost a very special member of the Smart Fitness family. 'Elwood was a founder trainer who played a big part in helping make Smart Fitness what it is today. 'He brought tremendous energy and warmth to the gym and his genuine kindness made everyone feel comfortable irrespective of their fitness level. 'He was such a talented personal trainer that he had the ability to encourage people to go beyond their limits and achieve results they wouldn’t have thought were possible. 'It’s so hard for us to imagine the gym and Smart camps without his smile, encouragement and dodgy banter.' Tragic: Mr McIlwraith is the third British ex-pat in as many months to fall to his death in Dubai. His devastated widow Susie, pictured right, is reportedly being comforted by friends at his gym Smart Fitness . Friends back in Hull have also paid tribute to Mr McIlwraith on social networking sites. On Facebook, Phil Owst said: 'My thoughts go out to his family and wife through this sad time. 'RIP my friend, you will be sorely missed.' Gerry Harkins said: 'Mate, I will never forget the first time I met you. An inspiration to so many people, will never forget you, big guy.' Mark Thistleton said: 'RIP Elwood McIlwraith, you will be missed. Can’t believe you’re gone pal.' Mr McIlwraith, a former pupil from Malet Lambet comprehensive in Kingston upon Hull, leaves a sister Melanie, a fitness trainer at Xercise4Less in his home town, mother Tracy Collinson and grandfather Don Smallwood.","Elwood McIlwraith plunged from the 42-storey Laguna Tower .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 07:06 EST, 17 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:35 EST, 17 July 2013 . Parliament's spy watchdog called for an investigation into Britain’s laws on intelligence eavesdropping yesterday as it cleared GCHQ of flouting the existing rules. The Intelligence and Security Committee ruled that the listening station in Cheltenham acted with ministerial backing when it requested electronic intercepts from the US National Security Agency’s Prism programme. But the committee raised questions about whether the rules governing intercepts are fit for purpose and whether there is a need for new laws. Spies at GCHQ headquarters near Cheltenham did not use the Prism programme to get around UK law, the Intelligence and Security Committee found . GCHQ faced criticism after NSA . whistleblower Edward Snowden claimed that British spies used the Prism . system to by-pass British laws. Mr Snowden is holed up in Moscow airport while seeking refuge in Latin America after leaking details of US government surveillance programmes. He claimed GCHQ secretly accessed fibre-optic cables carrying huge amounts of internet and communications data. Today the intelligence committee said the claims were ‘unfounded’. But the ISC said it would carry out an extra review to see if rules on accessing private data are strong enough. Foreign Secretary William Hague said the report vindicated the ‘professionalism and values’ of Britain’s spies. It had been suggested that GCHQ used the Prism programme to circumvent British law to gain access to online communications which would be illegal in the UK. Whistleblower Edward Snowden claimed GCHQ had secretly been tapping into and storing internet and communications data via fibre optic cables . But the ISC said that, in each case where GCHQ sought information from the US, an intercept warrant signed by a minister was already in place. ‘It has been alleged that GCHQ circumvented UK law by using the NSA's Prism programme to access the content of private communications. From the evidence we have seen, we have concluded that this is unfounded,’ the committee said. The committee, chaired by former foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind, said it had received detailed evidence from GCHQ as well as questioning its director, Sir Iain Lobban. Foreign Secretary William Hague said the verdict vindicated the professionalism of British spies . The material passed to it included a list of counter-terrorist operations in which GCHQ had received relevant intelligence from the US, a list of all UK nationals or individuals in the UK who were monitored through such arrangements, and a list of every ‘selector’ - such as email addresses - on which the request for the intelligence was based. The committee said it had also discussed the Prism progamme with the NSA and its congressional counterparts during a recent visit to the US. Mr Hague said: ‘I see daily evidence of the integrity and high standards of the men and women of GCHQ. The ISC's findings are further testament to their professionalism and values. ‘The Intelligence and Security Committee is a vital part of the strong framework of democratic accountability and oversight governing the use of secret intelligence in the UK. ‘It will continue to have the full co-operation of the Government and the security and intelligence agencies.’ While the ISC found that GCHQ had acted within the law, it expressed concern that the current legal framework for the intercept of communications was still adequate. ‘In some areas the legislation is expressed in general terms and more detailed policies and procedures have, rightly, been put in place around this work by GCHQ in order to ensure compliance with their statutory obligations under the Human Rights Act 1998,’ it said. ‘We are therefore examining the complex interaction between the Intelligence Services Act, the Human Rights Act and the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, and the policies and procedures that underpin them further.’","Claims by US whistleblower Edwards Snowden dismissed as 'unfounded'

Men’s new favourite chore, believe it or not, is washing and cleaning, but only if they get to do it with their most beloved tool - a jet washer. It is now the top choice for DIY tools for men in Britain, replacing the power drill, the powerful cleaning device is now the most popular gadget. It is the first time in almost 40 years that the power drill has been pipped to the top slot. Real men clean: The jet washer has bagged the top spot as the most popular DIY tool among British men . Littlewoods Retail Director Gary Kibble said: ‘Men have to have an excuse to use a power drill, such as putting up shelves or making a cabinet. 'The pleasure of using the drill is, unfortunately, only a brief part of a much longer procedure, and imposes other less enjoyable responsibilities. ’However using a jet washer is an end in itself. Men can blast away the dirt from a drive for hours at a time. 'And when they stop using it, there is no requirement to possess other skills such as woodwork or construction.' Bigger is better: The jet washer replaced the power drill as the most popular tool, and according to sales figures the most powerful devices are the ones men love the most . ‘Also, a jet washer can be combined with the nation’s second favourite weekend hobby - washing the car.’ Powerful jet washers which come with a water lance and a special circular patio cleaner are the biggest sellers according to Littlewoods. Some have air cooled motors, dirt blasters, and can develop over 110 bar pressure - enough to shift even the most stubborn piece of moss, the retailer said. As well as cleaning drives and patios, jet washers are also used for more unconventional purposes such as cleaning the barbecue, stripping old paint from garden furniture, weeding paths and blowing holes in tough soil to plant flower bulbs.","Jet washer is the most popular DIY tool among British men .

Britain's top rescue dog has finally hung up her lead after a career that saw her save more lives than any other dog and develop a pioneering scent detection technique. Mij led more than 200 search and rescue missions during her career and rescued 14 people who police had been searching for. She was so successful she was dubbed Britain's real-life Lassie, after the fictional dog from Eric Knight's 1940 novel Lassie Come-Home. Mij has finally hung up her lead after a career that saw her save more lives than any other dog . During Mij's seven-year career she became known as the most dependable dog in Britain and was called upon by police and search teams across the country, helping to save people from Scotland to Cornwall. One of her greatest moments came during the search for an elderly woman who had been missing from her home for more than 24 hours. Despite a 100-strong team's best efforts there was no trace of her and Mij was called in. After sniffing an item of her clothing Mij traced her final steps and within minutes had located the woman and helped to save her life after she'd fallen into wild bushes that completely surrounded her from eyesight. Owner Iain Nicholson, from Preston, Lancashire, said: 'It was truly one of her greatest moments and helped her to become known up and down the country. 'The woman Mij saved would never have been found but thanks to her she was rushed to hospital and made a full recovery. Mij suffered health problems as a puppy that hindered her stamina as a youngster .

'Mij is courageous and her technique . allows her to pinpoint the exact person's scent even if she were . surrounded by hundreds of others. 'Police . used to ring me up and ask if Mij could come and help search for . someone in the Lake District, Cornwall, Scotland and so on - we've been . all over the country in her time.' The . ten-year-old Collie suffered health problems as a puppy that hindered . her stamina as a youngster, meaning she was unable to follow traditional . training techniques for open area search dogs. Life-saver: Mij attended more than 200 search and rescue missions during her career - even finding 14 people for whom police had been searching for . Great team: Iain Nicholson with Mij the dog, who is handing up her lead . During Mij's seven-year career she became known as the most dependable dog and was called upon by police and search teams across the country, helping to save people from Scotland to Cornwall . Mij's her pioneering success has been used to help new rescue dogs master her methods . One of Mij's greatest moments came during the search for an elderly woman who had been missing from her home for more than 24 hours . But Mr Nicholson refused to put a dog down and under they eye of expert Tom Middlemas, taught her to conquer the art of scent discrimination. She can now distinguish an individual from a crowd of thousands with incredible accuracy. The method revolutionised the way rescue dogs comb the countryside and is now considered to be at the forefront of training throughout the world. Paul Durham, of the National Search and Rescue Dog Association, said: 'Mij was the first in the UK England to master the method and is now helping to train the new generation of 20 dogs. 'She attended the most search and rescue missions for a trailing dog and the number of people she saved was considerably higher than any other - she is truly remarkable. 'Mij could not be trained as an open area dog as she suffered from poor stamina as a puppy and wasn't able to run around a large areas to search - she changed disciplines and honed her skills in narrow scent discrimination trailing search work. 'Rather than prevent her from being a normal search dog Iain saw so much potential in her that handlers need and helped her become the best rescue dog in the country.' Mr Nicholson, who is the one of the UK's leading rescue dog trainers, now uses Mij's success over the past seven years to prepare the latest crop of search dogs after her retirement last year. Harold Burrows, chairman of NSRDA, hailed Mr Nicholson's leading work that enables dogs to track down an individual even if they are surrounded by thousands of other people. Mr Burrows said: 'While bloodhounds traditionally used a tracking method to follow footsteps and lead search teams down a certain path, Mij identified the unique scents humans leave behind as they walk. 'The process is incredibly valuable and completely transformed the searching process - rather than organising a team to search in a 360 degrees area Mij can tell us exactly which way a missing person went saving crucial hours. 'It can make the difference in a life or death situation.' Mij was so successful she was dubbed Britain's real-life Lassie, after the fictional dog from Eric Knight's 1940 novel Lassie Come-Home which was made into a 2005 film called Lassie (pictured)","Mij led more than 200 search and rescue missions during her career .

The facade will apparently be designed to let in light while keeping out the harsh desert sun, while the overall shape is meant to recall the country's wind-blown sand dunes. Lap of luxury: With marbled walkways, raised escalators and gold-plated walls, this proposed new metro station on Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, is a far cry from underground railway stations in other world cities . Sleek: An aerial view of the new station, the design of which is based on Saudi Arabia's wind-swept sand dunes . Luxury: The design will apparently let in the sun rays but air conditioning will keep commuters cool in what is one of the world's hottest countries . Amazingly, the new six-line network has been ordered to be completed by the ruling King Abdullah in just four years - the amount of time it took builders in New York to renovate just one station. What will frustrate weary London commuters even more is that the main feature of the new system, a three-way interchange at the city's busiest station, has been designed by half-British architect Zaha Hadid, who has been behind a string of developments around the world. The London-based designer, who is half-Iraqi, was the brains behind developments in the Capital's Hoxton Square and Eaton Place, as well as international projects in cities including New York, Singapore and Dubai.

A woman recovered the diamond from her £18,000 engagement ring two days after her German Shepherd swallowed it. Jack, a trainee police dog, chewed up the family heirloom on December 23 after Angie Collins put it on a side table while she manicured her nails. Before she knew what had happened, Jack spat out the mangled gold band and swallowed the jewel. Found: Angie Collins waited with German Shepherd Jack for two days until her diamond emerged . Mrs Collins, 51, from Exmouth in Devon, said: 'It must have winked at him. I went to the kitchen, came back and it was gone.' The civil servant, who looks after police puppies while they are being trained, scrambled around the floor with husband Graham but the other half was nowhere to be found. 'My husband and I emptied the entire room bit by bit which took hours,' she said. 'I could only conclude that Jack had eaten it.

Supermarkets were yesterday accused of targeting parents by selling alcohol alongside school uniforms and sweets. Campaigners said the irresponsible tactic could encourage impulse buying and ‘normalise the role of alcohol’ at home. A Home Office investigation found bottles of Smirnoff vodka, Jagermeister and other spirits on sale in Tesco next to school clothes. Warning: Photograph showing rum, whisky and vodka next to Sainsbury's sweets . A Sainsbury’s store was found selling chocolate snowmen and other sweets next to bottles of Absolut vodka and Bacardi rum. Other promotions uncovered included a WHSmith store at a motorway service station selling Strongbow cider and Carlsberg lager alongside soft drinks and food. A Lidl store stocked boxes of Christmas Jaffa Cakes next to bottles of spirits, cider and sparkling wine. Norman Baker, the Liberal Democrat crime prevention minister at the Home Office . Norman Baker, the Liberal Democrat crime prevention minister at the Home Office, said: ‘The situation where some irresponsible supermarkets sell alcohol next to children’s clothes or sweets can only encourage impulse buying. This is unacceptable and needs to stop.’ He added: ‘Industry needs to raise its game and do much more to help reduce problem drinking, and supermarkets have to recognise they have a significant part to play in this. ‘They need to promote and display alcohol more responsibly, do their bit to improve public awareness of the dangers of drink and support local areas in tackling alcohol-fuelled crime and disorder.’ Tom Smith, of Alcohol Concern, said: ‘Retailers have got to start taking this seriously and stop selling alcohol alongside everyday products such as children’s sweets and school uniforms. Selling booze like this drives impulse buying and serves only to normalise the role of alcohol in society. ‘The reality is that we’re facing historically high levels of health problems caused by alcohol misuse. If we’re to develop a culture of more responsible drinking, retailers have to play their part.’ Supermarkets have resisted government pressure to put alcohol in aisles separate from other items. Home Office figures show 963 big supermarkets sell alcohol round the clock. They make up 13 per cent of all bars, shops, hotels and pubs licensed to open 24 hours. Last year David Cameron abandoned plans for a 45p minimum price for a unit of alcohol amid resistance from the drinks industry, and a proposed ban on multi-buy discounts was also ditched. But Mr Baker’s comments signal a tougher line on alcohol promotions from within government. Tesco said: ‘Alcohol should not be next to school uniforms or any other products for children in our stores. We are looking into what happened in this store.’ Lidl said: ‘We take our role as a responsible retailer, and all matters of sales of age-restricted products, extremely seriously and will take any comments about the merchandising of our products on board.’ Sainsbury’s said: ‘We take the sale of age-restricted products very seriously. Anyone working on a checkout is trained to ask customers who look under 25 for ID before selling them alcohol.’ WHSmith said: ‘We have a very limited range of alcoholic drinks available in a small number of stores. We are committed to responsible marketing of these products; however, in some cases, the small store size makes it difficult to position alcohol far from soft drinks. ‘We comply with all legal requirements and ensure we are in line with best practice.’","Campaigners said the irresponsible tactic could encourage impulse buying .

Waitrose is considering legal action to stop its internet delivery partner teaming up with Morrisons. Ocado yesterday signed a £200million deal with the supermarket group, which charges less for groceries than upmarket Waitrose. Bosses at Waitrose will now fear that customers could switch to Morrisons, which had been the only major chain not to offer home delivery. They have consulted lawyers to see if they can scupper the new partnership on grounds of breach of contract. Done deal: Morrisons' products will be delivered to customers' homes from later this year but Waitrose believes it has an exclusive deal with Ocadao. A Waitrose spokesman said: ‘Once we’ve done that, we’ll decide what appropriate action to take.’ Morrisons has agreed a 25-year . partnership with Ocado, which should allow the internet delivery . business to start turning a profit. Both firms tried to placate Waitrose . by arguing the deal would not interfere with its delivery arrangement, . which runs to 2020. Groceries ordered via the Morrisons website will be . delivered in Morrisons vans. Dalton Philips, chief executive at . the chain, said: ‘From a standing start, Morrisons will be competing in . the fast-growing online channel by the end of this year with a really . compelling proposition. ‘The customer gets our affordable fresh food delivered by Ocado’s state-of-the-art distribution system.’ However he stressed: ‘This is a . Morrisons website, it’s Morrisons food, in a Morrisons van, with a . Morrisons driver, it’s Morrisons the whole way through. ‘It’s a very different arrangement from the sourcing arrangement Ocado has, where they source Waitrose food.’ New strategy: The deliveries will be made by a Morrisons-liveried fleet, although operations will be run by Ocado . A survey yesterday confirmed that Morrisons is cheaper than Waitrose on a range of standard products. It charges £3.72 for a regular . chicken compared with £5.49 at Waitrose. Cathedral City Cheddar is £4.50 . at Waitrose, more than double the offer price of £1.95 at Morrisons. And a 200g jar of Nescafé Gold Blend is £6.48 at Waitrose compared with . just £4 at its rival. Morrisons’ online operation will be . run from Ocado’s recently opened Dordon distribution centre in . Warwickshire. Morrisons will make an initial payment of £170million to . Ocado to buy the site and its equipment along with a licence and . integration fee. It will pay service costs, a . contribution to Ocado’s research and development programme and a share . of earnings at Morrisons online. The tie-up is significant because . Britain’s online food market is growing at around 16 per cent a year and . is set to almost double in value over the next five years to . £11billion. Moving forward: Morrisons chief executive Dalton Philips called the deal a 'significant strategic step' for the supermarket chain . Tom Ewing, of Fidelity, an investment . house with a stake in Ocado, said: ‘The deal with Morrisons announced . today is incredibly positive for Ocado. ‘It demonstrates that Morrisons agree . with our view that online will be the primary driver of future growth . in grocery retail in the UK and around the world.’ Mr Ewing said Ocado’s potential has been consistently underestimated by City investors. ‘This deal could mark the beginning . of a significant shift in the market’s perception of the company and a . recognition of the extraordinary economic value in its intellectual . property,’ he added. Ocado shares jumped 32 per cent yesterday to 266 pence, valuing the company at £1.54billion. The shares have had a rollercoaster ride since the company listed at 180p in 2010. At one point they fell as low as 54p. Ocado’s warehouses have robots that . fetch goods from towering shelves before placing them on a maze of . high-speed conveyor belts.

Three forgers were today jailed for a total of 12 years following what police believe was the largest ever plot to make fake pound coins in the UK - some of which may still be in circulation. Kevin Fisher, 53, of Goffs Oak, Hertfordshire, Daniel Sullivan, 28, of Hornchurch, east London, and Mark Abbott, 44, of Edmonton, north London, were all sentenced at Southwark Crown Court today. The three men were behind what is thought to be a record number of fake coins worth £1.5million, which were discovered after an undercover Metropolitan Police operation in May last year. Fake cash: Kevin Fisher (left), 53, of Hertfordshire, and Daniel Sullivan (right), 28, of east London, were jailed . A 40ft storage container that contained 1,600,000 metal discs was found in Waltham Abbey, Essex, with £20,000 of fake coins. There was also £30,000 in fake coins in a car nearby. Scotland Yard said the haul was ‘the tip of the iceberg’ for the gang, and that the coins were of high enough quality to pass off as real. It said some of the fake currency might now be in circulation. Bucketfuls of bogus 'good to go' coins worth £85,000 were seized at another site in Waltham Abbey. Some 30,000 coins were also discovered buried in the flooring of Abbott's Chrysler people-carrier, stashed in 30 boxes each containing £1,000, the court heard. Grandfather: Mark Abbott, 44, was 'in financial hardship and promised money for his participation' The gang used pay-as-you-go phones and coded messages to try to slip under the radar. Ringleader Fisher was jailed for seven years, co-conspirator Sullivan for three, and trader Abbott for two. Sentencing, Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith said: 'This was a scheme to manufacture and pass counterfeit coins on a very large scale indeed. 'I have no way of knowing how much counterfeit currency had been passed into the economy but the minimum number of coins and discs seized in this case was over 1.5million. 'This was a sophisticated and carefully run operation with pay-as-you-go phones and coded text messages to prevent detection. The reliability of the money in our pockets is essential in everyday life.' Shaven-headed and wearing a grey fleece jacket, Abbott put his head in his hands and appeared to be on the verge of tears as the sentence was passed. Fisher, wearing a beige sweater, light blue shirt and glasses, and Sullivan, sporting a black long-sleeved top, remained stony-faced as they were led out of the dock. Alexander Cameron, defending Fisher, insisted he was not the person who produced the blank discs or hired the containers, adding that someone else was ‘making money out of it’. Jason Dunn-Shaw, defending Abbott, said the father of three and grandfather of one was part of a 'close family’, adding: 'He was in financial hardship and was promised money for his participation.’ Stash: Some of the counterfeit money that was seized by Scotland Yard officers in an undercover operation .

Union boss Len McCluskey has laid out a £63billion shopping list of left-wing policies he says Labour must adopt or lose millions in funding. The Unite general secretary – dubbed Red Len – warned Labour faces bankruptcy as a result of Ed Miliband’s attempts to water down union influence on the party. And he said the Labour leader had to be ‘bold’ and reverse the coalition’s benefit reforms, halt spending cuts and borrowing billions to build 1million extra homes. Demands: Unite general secretary Len McCluskey set out his policy wish list, including opposing spending cuts and benefit reforms, which he says Labour must adopt . Pressure has mounted on Mr Miliband over his links to the unions, after allegations emerged that Unite had paid for people to join Labour without their knowledge to influence candidate selection. David Cameron has repeatedly accused Labour allowing unions to 'buy' the party;s policies, candidates and even Mr Miliband's leadership victory over his brother David. Unite has given Labour more than £8.4million in funding since Mr Miliband became leader in 2010. Earlier this month he announced plans to change the way that union members give money to the Labour party. Mr Miliband said union political levy payers would have to ‘opt in’ to join Labour individually, instead of being signed up automatically. But several union leaders have warned there is little enthusiasm among their members for joining Labour and the plan could cost the party millions. Mr McCluskey said it was ‘a really good, morally defensible idea’ but in practice it could prove disastrous for Labour, with barely 10 per cent of Unite’s 3million political levy payers signing up;. ‘The gamble and the danger is whether it will bankrupt the Labour party,’ he said in an interview with the Guardian. There was clearly a danger that Mr Miliband's plan ‘could fall flat on its face and fail’. He added: ‘There is no doubt we would have to work very hard because our members are not queuing to join the Labour party, or be associated with the Labour party. That is really Ed's challenge.’ Attacks: Prime Minister David Cameron (left) has repeatedly accused unions of 'buying' Labour policies and Ed Miliband's leadership victory over his brother in 2010 . With the threat of millions of pounds of automatic payments disappearing from Labour coffers, Mr McCluskey set out his demands for a new policy agenda opposing spending cuts and welfare reforms. He said Mr Miliband ‘has got to give ordinary trade unionists reasons to want to be associated with the Labour party’. ‘And that really is about policy. He knows within this next 12 months he has got to start out with policy that gives hope to people and something different from the austerity programme that the government is pursuing that engenders nothing but fear.’ He called for the repeal of cuts to housing benefit for unused spare rooms – dubbed the bedroom tax by Labour, the reversal of the benefits cap which means no family can receive more than £26,000 and an end to ‘austerity spending’. The end of the spare room subsidy is saving £465million-a-year while the benefit cap is expected to save £185million. It means those two policies alone would require an extra £3.25billion in extra borrowing over the course of the next parliament. Mr McCluskey also called for 1million extra homes to be built, which Tories claim could cost £60billion. A Conservative source said: 'This proves that nothing’s changed. Len McCluskey's Unite union still has total control over a weak Ed Miliband. Len McCluskey can still buy Labour’s candidates, buy their policies, and pick their leader. ‘In a single article today the Unite boss is demanding that Labour borrow £63.2 billion over the five years, meaning higher taxes and higher bills. It’s hardworking people who would pay the price.' Mr McCluskey added: ‘Miliband has got a real task on his hands. The prize of being prime minister is within his grasp ... but he has to be bold - and not just on issues that ordinary working people don't give a toss about like the union block vote.’ At Prime Minister's Questions yesterday, Mr Cameron stepped up his attacks on Labour's union links. Mr Miliband accused the PM of caving in to big tobacco after ditching plans for plain cigarette packaging. It emerged new Tory election guru Lynton Crosby counts tobacco giant Philip Morris International among the clients of his lobbying firm. But Mr Cameron hit back at the Labour leader: 'If he wants a lobbying scandal, why does he not try the fact that the trade unions buy his policies, buy his candidates and even bought and paid for his leadership? 'That is a scandal, and he should do something about it.'","Unite general secretary tells Ed Miliband to be 'bold' in appeal to unions .

While the team colors were right, and the Panther logo was correct, they were paired with the wrong state. Instead of North Carolina, the t-shirts featured the unmistakable shape of South Carolina along with the letters ‘NC.’ State of Confusion: Sports apparel giant Nike recently dropped the ball when it offered a Carolina Panthers shirt that mixed up South Carolina and North Carolina . Those, of course, are the initials for North Carolina. And though the Carolina Panthers name is meant to invoke both states, the team plays home game at Bank of America in Charlotte, North Carolina. The shirt sold for $32, but was soon taken down from the company's web store. The error was first reported on the sports blog of Charlotte Observer columnist Scott Fowler, called Scott Says. It was caught, Fowler wrote, by eagle-eyed Charlotte resident Les Hall, who then decided to buy the shirt for a laugh. What they meant: Written inside the state of South Carolina were the state initials 'NC,' for North Carolina . After Fowler’s post and subsequent story in the Observer, which were followed by a flurry of reports of the embarrassing mistake on websites and social media across the web, Nike responded. ‘A small quantity of incorrect Carolina Panthers tee shirts were recently made available for sale,’ wrote a spokesperson Brian Strong. ‘This product should not have been sold. We have removed it from sale and apologize for the error.’ How many shirts, exactly, were sold and how many were made at all remains unclear. As Fowler notes, Hall now likely has a collector's item on his hands, one worth well over the $32 he paid.

"And gross mortgage lending rocketed to £15billion in June, a massive increase of 26 per cent . By . Becky Barrow . PUBLISHED: . 14:13 EST, 18 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:15 EST, 19 July 2013 . House prices will rise by nearly 20 per cent over the next five years with the cost of the average home reaching nearly £200,000, research revealed today. Savills, the upmarket estate agency, said it has upgraded its housing market forecast from a rise of 11.5 per cent by 2017 to a jump of 18.1 per cent. The research said ‘government intervention’ partly triggered the upgrade while critics warned the interventions are fuelling a house price boom but doing nothing to help lending to businesses. House prices will rise by nearly 20 per cent over the next five years with the cost of the average home reaching nearly £200,000, research revealed today . Yesterday the Council of Mortgage Lenders said gross mortgage lending rocketed to £15billion in June, a massive increase of 26 per cent on the same month last year. It is the highest monthly total since October 2008, the month that taxpayers were forced to bail out both Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group as the crisis struck. Millions of homeowners have never enjoyed cheaper mortgage deals, while the number of first-time buyers is rising sharply helping by loans which demand only a small deposit. Savills predicts the average home, worth around £162,000 at the beginning of the year, will be worth £191,631 by the end of 2017, a rise of nearly £30,000 or 18.1 per cent. While mortgage lending is rising, lending to businesses continues to fall. Yesterday the Business Secretary Vince Cable said estimates show net lending by UK banks to small and medium-sized firms has been negative for 22 of 24 months to May. Separate figures, from the Bank of England, also published yesterday, show lending to all businesses contracted by around £4.5billion between March and May. Yesterday the Council of Mortgage Lenders said gross mortgage lending rocketed to £15billion in June, a massive increase of 26 per cent on the same month last year . It warned: ‘The annual rate of growth in this measure of the stock of lending to businesses has been negative for the past four years.’ Lord Oakeshott, a leading LibDem peer, slammed Funding for Lending, a Government scheme launched last . August, which allows banks to borrow cheap money if they maintain or increase lending to . households or firms. He said: ‘Funding for Lending is turning into a total disaster. ‘It is pouring fuel on the flames of an already over-heated housing market while doing nothing to help businesses.’ Howard Archer, chief UK economist at the consultancy IHS Global Insight, said: ‘The Funding for Lending Scheme continues to have very limited impact in supporting bank lending to companies. ‘At best, it appears that it may have stopped lending to businesses from falling more than it has.’ spt_house_prices_june.jpg . Lucian Cook, director of residential research at Savills, said: ‘A combination of low interest rates and stimulus measures means there is capacity for improved price growth over the next three years or so.’ The Government’s two Help to Buy schemes are also helping to fuel the housing market, pushing a home even further out of the reach of many workers on average salaries. One of the Help to Buy schemes allows people to buy a new-build home with only a five per cent deposit. The other Help to Buy, which will launch in January, allows anybody from a first-time buyer to a ‘second move’ to buy an old or new home for up to £600,000 with only a small deposit, but a Government guarantee on a further chunk of the loan.","Savills said it has upgraded its housing market forecast from a rise of 11.5 per .

Jeremy Hunt is to launch a wide-ranging attack on GPs, claiming some do not even know their patients’ names. In a major speech, the Health Secretary will condemn the scandal of out-of-hours services where ‘you speak to a doctor who doesn’t know you from Adam’. In a frank assessment of the failings of ‘largely reactive’ surgeries, he will insist family doctors must once again take ultimate responsibility for round-the-clock care. Personal service: Patients should know that one family doctor (file picture) is responsible for them, and even if their GP is not on call it will be clear that 'the buck stops' with them, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt will say . He will liken surgeries to ‘mini A&E units’ where doctors are struggling to cope with the huge volume of patients. And in a response to growing concern over the quality of care outside office hours, the Health Secretary will unveil a new chief inspector of GPs, whom he says will crack down hard on surgeries that fail to provide a good service at all times. Patients should know that one family doctor is responsible for them, and even if their GP is not on call it will be clear that ‘the buck stops’ with them, he will say. The Daily Mail has repeatedly highlighted the scandal of out-of-hours care. Last week it emerged that Harmoni, Britain’s biggest provider of such care, was paying GPs £1,350 a shift because managers were so desperate to cover evenings and weekends. The firm has also had to use senior nurses to cover whole districts overnight. In the speech, which he will make to the King’s Fund health think-tank on Thursday, Mr Hunt will also respond to growing problems in hospital accident and emergency units, where admissions have soared because, he says, there is ‘no credible alternative’. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, pictured in Whitehall today, will condemn the scandal of out-of-hours services where 'you speak to a doctor who doesn't know you from Adam' ‘Everyone agrees that hospitals should only be a last resort for the frail elderly and that – for someone perhaps with dementia and other complex conditions – A&E departments can be extremely confusing places,’ he will say. ‘But what alternatives do we offer? GP surgeries where it is often impossible to get an appointment the next day; same day appointments but only if you call at 8 o’clock in the morning sharp and are lucky getting through; long waits on the phone to get through, sometimes at premium rates; difficulty in registering with another practice if you move home, or aren’t happy with the service you are receiving; out-of-hours services where you speak to a doctor who doesn’t know you from Adam and has no access to your medical record.’ Mr Hunt will argue Labour made a ‘historic mistake’ by allowing GPs to opt out of out-of-hours care and paying them ‘not for looking after people as individuals, but for complying with a myriad of targets and requirements’. He is understood to want to move away from a contract which pays doctors for hitting targets to one based on the quality of care round the clock. Under Labour’s 2004 renegotiation of their contracts, GPs were allowed to hand responsibility for out-of-hours care to private firms such as Harmoni. The new contract, Mr Hunt will say, removed ‘at a stroke the need to think holistically about a patient’s entire needs.’ It meant some of the traditional work of the family doctor, such as ringing elderly patients just out of hospital, ‘is too often forgotten or left undone’. He will say: ‘As a member of the public, I want to know my GP. And I want my GP to be someone that knows me and my family. 'Yet we’ve turned GP practices into places where it’s a daily challenge for receptionists to cope with huge call volumes and GPs to get through to all the people they need to see.’ 'As a member of the public, I want to know my GP. And I want my GP to be someone that knows me and my family' Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt . Andy Burnham, Labour’s shadow health secretary, said: ‘A&E has deteriorated sharply on David Cameron’s watch and it’s not good enough for his Government to blame others – it is a mess of their making. ‘In 2009, 98 per cent of people were seen within the four-hour A&E target. David Cameron should stop trying to blame the crisis in A&E on something that happened ten years ago.’","Jeremy Hunt will use speech to condemn scandal of out-of-hours services .

A woman whose abusive husband bit off her nose in a rage has spoken out about the horror of being trapped in a violent relationship. Lynne Gough told how her husband Nick punched her violently in the face for half an hour until it was so numb that when he then bit her, she didn't realise that he had bitten off her nose. Speaking to Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford on This Morning yesterday, Lynne said the savage attack - that left her needing hours of reconstructive surgery - was the culmination of many years of systematic abuse. Scroll down to hear from Lynne . Savaged: Lynne Gough suffered years of abuse at the hands of her husband of 24 years until it culminated with him biting off her nose in a jealous rage . 'I remember it all like it was yesterday,' she said. 'He'd been punching me in the face that much I was numb. 'Then he attacked with his teeth - and I didn't realise until afterwards that he'd actually bitten off my nose.' 52-year-old Lynne, who had been married to Nick for 24 years and had six children with him, said she had only recently reunited with her former husband after leaving him for another man after years of abuse and aggressive behaviour drove her out of the marital home. 'Nick was always a bully and very controlling,' she said. 'He would run at me with fists but would never land a punch. Or he'd run at me with a knife. Lynne's nose had to be reattached during hours of reconstructive surgery . When I burst into tears, he would say ""I'm just trying to scare you"". 'On that day, when he brought his . fist back I didn't think it would actually land. But it did - and it . went on landing for half an hour before he finally bit off my nose.' Lynne says that Nick, 59, had always been a . very jealous man - something that at the beginning of their . relationship she found flattering. However, his jealousy and possessiveness soon transformed into a dangerous rage that he would unleash on Lynne without warning. 'I . found work in a care home and after a few years became a manager. He . hated the fact that I had freedom. He wanted me at home the whole time,' Lynne says. 'He would wait for me at the front door and accuse me of having affairs with people at work. Lynne says the jealousy began in earnest when she had her first child with Nick. 'Even in the hospital on the day our baby was born he accused me of having affair with one of the members of staff. 'Then after that it was anyone. If I went shopping it was someone I'd meet on the street, or people at the children's school. 'He'd even question me if my underwear matched.' 'When we were young and in love I thought it was flattering. But when I went out to work it got worse. 'Neither . of us had any friends,' she says. 'I wasn't allowed to socialise. One . day at the pub a man kissed me on the cheek. Nick accused me of having . an affair with him, even though we'd only met half an hour earlier. 'That night when we got home, he started drinking more and got really aggressive and abusive.' Shockingly, . Lynne reveals that Nick would subject her to what he called 'Chinese . Water Torture' at nights - splashing water on her face and straddling . her, holding her eyes open - in an attempt to force her to admit to . affairs. Yet still she could not leave him, saying that she loved him so much, she 'put up with it'. 'I loved him. We had children together. I was a mother. I wanted to put my children first. But you can only stand so much.' 'I loved him': Lynne says she couldn't bring herself to leave Nick, right - the husband she adored - despite the horrific abuse she endured at his hands . During . this time, Lynne became friendly with a fellow manager at the care home . where she worked. Chris had recently gone through a divorce from his . wife and noticed that Lynne appeared tired and stressed. She confided in him that Nick was keeping her awake at night with his twisted form of questioning. Eventually, after years of abuse, Lynne decided to leave her husband and move in with Chris. But less than a year later in 2006, Chris died suddenly of a heart attack. 'We'd . gone to the gym together, then I'd popped out to get some food,' she . says. 'When I came back, I heard Chris say ""Lynne"" very calmly. Then I . went upstairs and I saw him fall to the floor. 'I . started mouth to mouth and heart massage but I couldn't bring him back. An ambulance took him to the hospital but he was dead on arrival. 'It was a massive loss in my life,' she says. A year after Chris's death, Nick contacted his ex-wife and asked her to come back to him. 'Chris had only been dead a year when Nick phoned me,' she says. 'He begged me to take him back, promising that he had changed and learned his lesson.' Miracle: Lynne told Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford on This Morning that she has nothing but praise for the doctors who rebuilt her face . Foolishly Lynne believed him, and she went back the husband who had already subjected her to years of terror. 'It was fine initially, but soon got worse than ever,' she says. 'The day he attacked me would have been Chris's 47th birthday, so I was obviously emotional, but I carried on as usual. I called Nick at work, told him I loved him and told him what we'd have for tea. 'He noticed when he came home that I'd been crying. I didn't want to tell him, but he persisted until I admitted it would have been Chris's birthday. 'I could see a change in his eyes. He wasn't happy at all. I took the dog for a walk to try to calm the situation down. When I came back I went out into the back garden. He came out and that's when he started to attack me,' she says. Lynne, who has now had her face fully rebuilt, said the doctors worked miracles with reconstructive surgery. 'The doctors did an amazing job rebuilding it,' she said. 'They slit down the centre of my nose and pulled my forehead down to cover it. 'The first time it didn't work and had to be taken back off, but now it's reattached and works normally - I can still smell.' In March this year Nick pleaded guilty to wounding with intent at Wolverhampton Crown Court and was sentenced to five years in prison.

American scientists believe they have found a way to ‘switch off’ the extra chromosome that causes Down’s syndrome. Researchers at the University of Massachusetts Medical School have managed to prevent the condition in human cells in a laboratory. They believe that this breakthrough could eventually lead to treatments for the syndrome. Down's Syndrome is a genetic condition that causes learning disabilities and a characteristic range of physical features. It occurs as a result of an extra chromosome called chromosome 21 . Gene therapy has already been used to treat medical problems that result from the presence of one defective gene, but this is the first time that silencing the impact of a whole chromosome has become a possibility. The BBC reports that the breakthrough means that this could now be possible. However, it will require many more years of research. A team of scientists at the university added a gene called XIST to lab-grown stem cells with Down’s syndrome. This gene is important in natural cell development as it turns off one of the two X chromosomes that are found in female embryos. The researchers found that it could be used in the same way to silence the extra copy of chromosome 21 that is found in people with Down’s syndrome. Lead researchers, Dr Jeanne Lawrence, . told BBC News: ‘The research means that we have a new way - right away - . to study the cellular basis for Down's Syndrome, that could help . identify drugs for Down's Syndrome. Researchers have managed to prevent the condition in human cells in a laboratory . ‘At the same time we have made it conceivable - not necessarily possible or effective, that still needs to be proven - but conceivable, that you could use just a single gene to correct the over-expression of the whole chromosome. So it makes genetic therapy for Down's syndrome more conceivable where it really wasn't before.’ Carol Boys, chief executive of the Down's Syndrome Association, told BBC News: ‘The findings could have serious implications for future work that may be of real benefit to people with Down's Syndrome.’ Down's Syndrome is a genetic condition that causes learning disabilities and a characteristic range of physical features. It occurs as a result of an extra chromosome called chromosome 21. The degree of learning disability varies between people with the syndrome. People with Down's Syndrome are often shorter than average, have eyes that slant upwards, small ears, and reduced muscle tone. They are also prone to heart defects, thyroid problems, infections, blood disorders and early onset Alzheimer’s disease. Down's Syndrome is one of the most common genetic causes of learning disabilities and about 750 babies are born with the condition every year in the UK.","Down's syndrome (DS) is a genetic condition that occurs as a result of an extra chromosome called chromosome 21 .

He had refused to obey officers’ instructions and had to be restrained, according to prison sources. It is understood that five officers have to be on hand when . Adebolajo leaves his cell. Four of the officers were suspended on Thursday, while the . fifth was suspended yesterday. All of the officers are on full pay pending the . results of the investigation. Peter McParlin, chairman of the Prison Officers Association, accused the Ministry of Justice of over-reacting to the situation. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'We have spoken to our members and on the basis of what our members have told us they have done absolutely nothing wrong. 'We are concerned that the Ministry of Justice have over-reacted due to the notoriety of this prisoner.' Mr McParlin criticised the MoJ for failing to 'correct false reporting of the incident at Belmarsh. He said restraint techniques were designed to minimise injuries to staff or prisoners 'but sometimes there are unforeseen consequences in any violent incident'. Mr McParlin added: 'Some people have the idea that somehow it's a sitcom like Porridge. I'm afraid the reality of the modern prison system is far different from that. He told the Times: ‘We feel that the Ministry of Justice have let the staff down . here. ‘They have suspended five of our members but that does not . necessarily mean they are guilty of anything.’ Adebolajo’s brother Jeremiah said Adebolajo telephoned . after the incident, saying that he was bleeding and had lost the teeth. A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Justice confirmed that . police are investigating the incident. She said: ‘I can confirm five members of . staff have been suspended while there is a police investigation on going.’ She added that this was ‘not unusual’. Adebolajo has been charged with murder and possession of a . revolver, and also charged with the attempted murder of two police officers. Accusations: Adebolajo is accused of hacking Fusilier Rigby (left) to death together with Michael Adebowale, 22 (right, in a court drawing). The two suspects are due to stand trial on November 18 . His alleged accomplice, Michael Adebowale, is charged with . murder and possession of a firearm for the May 22 attack outside Woolwich barracks. In . a statement earlier this week, the POA said the officers involved . 'strenuously deny any wrongdoing' and that the prisoner had been . 'subjected to restraint using techniques' which are 'only used where . necessary'. It added: 'The POA will be supporting them legally and emotionally during this difficult time. 'The use of restraint is only used where necessary when dealing with incidents up and down the country. 'The POA will fully co-operate with . any police investigation and are hopeful that this matter will be . resolved quickly and we expect the officers to be completely . exonerated.' Adebolajo, from Romford, east London, . complained about his treatment at the hands of prison staff during a . court appearance last month. Violent incident: Adebolajo lost two teeth as he was restrained by officers at Belmarsh jail (pictured) in London . During the June 5 hearing via . video-link from the prison, he was flanked by prison officers in full . riot gear. Belmarsh staff asked for him to be handcuffed on the basis he . was ‘unpredictable’ and had refused to comply with their orders. The judge, Mr Justice Sweeney, terminated the video-link after Adebolajo launched into a series of rants against prison staff. The unit in which he is being detained . has the highest security classification in the country, and holds . notorious terror suspects and dangerous felons. Inmates have included Al Qaeda . preacher Abu Qatada until his deportation earlier this month, and . fanatic Abu Hamza, who was extradited to the US last year. The cost of . keeping each inmate in the unit is estimated at £65,000 a year. Jail: It is understood several officers were called in to help after Adebolajo began acting violently on Wednesday, and he was injured during the subsequent melee in the prison's high-security wing . Crowds of wellwishers line the street as the funeral cortege of Fusilier Lee Rigby drives away from Bury Parish church on July 12 following a funeral service attended by 800 . A November 2009 inspection report on . Belmarsh criticised the ‘extremely high’ amount of force used to control . inmates at the prison, and said large numbers of inmates claimed they . had been intimidated by prison staff. A Prison Service spokesman said: ‘The police are investing an incident which took place at HMP Belmarsh on July 17. ‘It would be inappropriate to comment while the investigation is ongoing.’ A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘We . can confirm that an allegation of assault was passed to the Metropolitan . Police on July 17 by Belmarsh Prison. An investigation has been . started.’ Rigby, 25, a father of one from Middleton, Rochdale, died . from multiple wounds after he was attacked in the street. The Prime Minister and thousands of . mourners attended his military funeral last week, at which his . two-year-old son Jack wore a T-shirt bearing the words ‘My Daddy My . Hero’.","Several officers 'called in to help after Adebolajo began acting violently'

American scientists have invented the world's first ultrasound scanner for smartphones, which could revolutionise healthcare in countries where the technology is not widely available. The MobiUS scanner plugs into smartphones and tablets to provide an instant scan image on the mobile device's screen. Its inventors believe that the device's portability and small price tag could provide a breakthrough in medical care in third world countries. Scientists have invented the world's first ultrasound scanner for smartphones, which could revolutionise healthcare in countries where the technology is not widely available. The MobiUS scanner plugs straight into smartphones and tablets, . providing an instant scan image on the mobile device's screen . Ultrasound scans use high frequency sound waves to create an image of body parts to help with diagnoses. They are best known for their use during pregnancy to see the baby in the womb but are also used to scan organs such as the heart, lungs, liver, gall bladder and breasts. However, ultrasound scanners are usually fairly large, expensive and situated in hospitals and clinics, which could be a long distance away from the people who need them in poorer countries. To solve these problems, scientists spent three years developing the MobiUS, which can transmit images over a mobile network or WiFi. Ultrasound scans (pictured) are best known for their use during pregnancy but are also used to scan organs. However, ultrasound scanners are usually fairly large and situated in hospitals and clinics, which could be a long distance away from the people who need them . The scanner is supplied with its own Windows tablet or smartphone, but its inventors are working on versions compatible with Apple and Android operating systems. The MobiUS costs £7,000 compared to £60,000 for a full-size ultrasound model. Sailesh Chutani, CEO of US creators MobiSante, said: 'Ultrasound imaging is safe, effective and can save lives, however more than 70 per cent of the world's population does not have access to ultrasound because it is expensive and not portable enough. 'Devices like MobiUS enable more care to be provided outside of expensive settings like hospitals into settings that are less expensive, such as clinics and other locations where the patient needs immediate care. 'This is key to improving access while reducing costs.' The MobiUS scanner is supplied with its own Windows tablet (pictured) or smartphone, but its inventors are working on versions compatible with Apple and Android operating systems. The portable system costs £7,000 compared to £60,000 for a full-size ultrasound model . He believes accurate and inexpensive diagnostics at the point of care is critical to reducing healthcare costs, while also improving outcomes. Mr Chutani said that the MobiUS interface is extremely simple and can be mastered in just a few minutes. 'MobiUS has built in network connectivity which allows easy sharing of images from the device, for storage as well as for second opinion or remote diagnosis. 'The device starts in less than a minute and since it is battery powered, it can work off the electric grid.' This could be extremely useful in poorer countries where power is limited or unreliable. The company said: 'MobiUS fuses the power and wireless connectivity of a smartphone with the internet into a game-changing diagnostic solution that is personal and accessible.' The MobiUS interface is simple to use so that nurses, such as the one pictured, can master it quickly.

A self-described conservative Republican who is a manager in the Internal Revenue Service office that targeted tea party groups told investigators that he, not the White House, set the review in motion, the top Democrat on the House watchdog committee said Sunday. Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., released a partial transcript of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform interview with the unnamed manager in the IRS' Cincinnati office. In it, the employee said the extra scrutiny for tea party groups' tax exempt status was an effort to be consistent in reviewing applications and not driven by politics. Democratic Representative Elijah Cummings: Says 'extreme accusations' of Washington's involvement in the IRS scandal are 'unsubstantiated' This letterhead from the IRS headquarters in Washington, DC, accompanied a probing letter directed at a tea party group. The IRS Inspector General investigated only similar communications from the agency's Cincinnati office . 'He is a conservative Republican . working for the IRS. I think this interview and these statements go a . long way to what's showing that the White House was not involved in . this,' Cummings said. 'Based upon everything I've seen, the . case is solved. And if it were me, I would wrap this case up and move . on, to be frank with you,' Cummings added. In the five-hour interview conducted . last week, the manager said one of his employees brought to him a tea . party group's application for tax exempt status. The manager said he . recognized the political implications of the decision and flagged it for . an office in Washington. Some Republicans have suggested that the . Washington office initiated the close examination. IRS offices in the California towns of El Monte and Laguna Niguel sent politically motivated letters to tea party groups, suggesting that the problem reached beyond the Cincinnati office where the IG report focused . One letter, sent to a northern California organization, demanded to know about its links with the Redding (Calif.) Tea Party Patriots. 'Tea party' was one phrase that reportedly triggered a 'Be On The Lookout' notice among IRS employees looking for politically conservative applicants for tax-exempt statuses . Republicans have complained the IRS . targeted tea party groups because they are critical of Democrats and . President Barack Obama. An internal IRS report found the agency . improperly targeted the small-government advocates for additional . scrutiny. The uproar forced out the acting IRS . chief and put the White House on the defensive against those who . suggested Obama was using the government to go after political enemies. Sunday's release of yet another partial transcript was unlikely to quiet those critics. 'The American public wants to know . why targeting occurred and who was involved,' said oversight chairman . Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., in statement released Sunday. 'The . testimony excerpts Ranking Member Cummings revealed today did not . provide anything enlightening or contradict other witness accounts. The . only thing Ranking Member Cummings left clear in his comments today is . that if it were up to him the investigation would be closed.' The Tea Party Patriots and other conservative groups provided a powerful rallying force during the 2010 midterm elections. It was around the same time that the Obama administration's IRS began targeting such groups that applied for tax-exempt nonprofit status . Oversight committee investigators . have now interviewed at least five IRS employees about targeting . conservative groups for additional scrutiny when they applied for . tax-exempt status during the 2010 and 2012 elections. Some employees . said they believed that officials in Washington were directing their . work but didn't show any direct evidence to support their statements. Cummings and Issa have been releasing . portions of interviews that back up their assertions. But neither has . released full transcripts, making it difficult to discern a complete . story. Also, the portions released tend to offer employees' views on . what was happening, not definitive orders that directed them to . scrutinize closely tea party applications. Rain or shine: Tea party stalwarts were known for stubbornly supporting a strict reading of the U.S. Constitution, and for getting under the skin of political liberals. News that the IRS, under the Obama administration, singled them out for special screening, may energize them into another potent force in time for the 2014 election . Cummings declined to release the full transcript of the interview he posted on Democrats' oversight website. A Cummings spokeswoman, Jennifer Hoffman, declined to release the employees' identity. In the 15-page memo describing their . interview with the manager, Democrats on the committee said they were . withholding the employee's name at the request of the IRS. Cummings appeared on CNN's 'State of the Union' and CBS's 'Face the Nation'.","Top Democrat Elijah Cummings says no evidence to suggest order to review conservative groups was a White House order .

A device that can diagnose attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and teenagers has been approved for use. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is now allowing marketing of the device which measures brain function to help assess whether a child has the condition. It is designed to be used to confirm a doctor’s diagnosis, or to make up part of a complete examination which would also include psychological tests. The Neuropsychiatric EEG-Based Assessment Aid (NEBA) System records different electrical impulses given off by nerve cells in the brain, and the number of times the impulses are given off each second. During a 15 minute non-invasive test it calculates the ratio of two standard brain waves – theta and beta waves. The theta/beta ratio has been shown to be higher in children and adolescents with ADHD than in children without it. ‘Diagnosing ADHD is a multi-step process based on a complete medical and psychiatric exam,’ said Christy Foreman, director of the Office of Device Evaluation at the FDA’s Centre for Devices and Radiological Health. ‘The NEBA System, along with other clinical information, may help healthcare providers more accurately determine if ADHD is the cause of a behavioural problem.’ To test the device, a clinical study was carried out that evaluated 275 children and adolescents ranging from six to 17-years-old with attention or behavioural issues. Clinicians evaluated all 275 patients using the NEBA System and using standard diagnostic techniques, including behavioural questionnaires, IQ testing, and physical examinations to determine if the patient had ADHD. An independent group of ADHD experts reviewed the data and decided on a diagnosis. The study results showed that the use of the NEBA System helped doctors make a more accurate diagnosis of ADHD when it was used in conjunction with a clinical assessment for ADHD, compared with doing the clinical assessment alone.

The bodies of twin British pensioners have been found dead in their Spanish flat in what police believe may have been a double suicide. James and George Chalkley, both 83, were found in the property they shared in the Andalusian coastal town of Fuengirola, near Malaga, on Wednesday. Investigators think one of the brothers may have returned home to find his sibling had taken his life - and decided to do the same. Tragedy: The British twins were living in an apartment on this street - Federico Ruiz Vertedor - in Fuengirola . Fuengirola is a Spanish coastal town popular with British tourists and ex-pats . A suicide note was recovered at the scene. They had lived together in their . third-floor flat in Fuengirola for around 13 years after moving to the . area from Holland where they lived initially after their retirement. A post-mortem was due to take place later today. One of the victims was found sprawled on a chair in his living room with . two plastic bags tied tightly over his head with rope and masking tape. A source close to the inquiry said: 'An investigation has been launched . but everything at this stage is pointing to a double suicide. 'One twin had a head injury but we believe it may have been the result . of him banging his head against the wall as he was asphyxiating himself. 'We believe one twin left the flat after rowing with his brother and took his own life after returning to find him dead. 'An investigating judge placed in charge of the inquiry into their death is now examining all this in more detail.' The British twins were found dead in an apartment they shared in the Spanish coastal town of Fuengirola . The dead pair, both from London, are understood to have spent their whole lives living together. They shared a flat in the UK before moving together to Amsterdam and then the Costa del Sol. James worked as a lorry driver before retiring and moving into part-time TV and film acting,  including as an extra on Eastenders in the early nineties. He spent about four years on the BBC1 soap playing the part of a market trader, and also appeared as an extra on ITV's The Bill. George had worked in hospitals.

Rebecca and Paul Cutts said their big day was ruined when the reception was hit by a string of mishaps . A heartbroken bride was left in tears after claiming a top hotel served up a 'Fawlty Towers' fiasco complete with a drunken chef and 'obnoxious' staff. Rebecca Cutts booked her big day at the hotel, which once featured on TV's The Hotel Inspector, when she married her partner Paul. But the couple, from Rawmarsh, near Rotherham, say their big day was ruined when the reception was hit by a string of mishaps that saw some of the 65 guests served food that was still frozen and uncooked. The couple, both aged 30, claim Champagne they had paid for was not served and some of the guests were not served the food they should have been, while those who were faced long delays. The couple say when they did complain, staff at the Sandygate Hotel, Wath-upon-Dearne, South Yorkshire, were dismissive and told them: 'What do you expect for a cheap wedding?' The hotel has said it is aware of the complaints and is working to resolve them. The hotel's acting manager has said the couple stayed the night at the hotel, had breakfast the next morning and left without making any complaints . The couple were organising their wedding on a tight budget after Paul, a trained chef, was made redundant from his job at a Job Centre. Devastated Mrs Cutts, a special needs carer, said : 'It was a disaster a complete joke from start to finish. Our reception was ruined by a drunken chef who couldn't stand up. 'If it had not been so serious and such a disaster for us it would have been laughable. It was like an episode from Fawlty Towers with the drunken chef and obnoxious staff. 'Paul saw the chef who could hardly stand he had been drinking so much and just like on Fawlty Towers the staff were running round trying to sort things out. 'Some meals were served frozen, they ran out of stock on a pre-ordered menu and desserts were only served to half the guests. The couple say when they did complain, staff at the Sandygate Hotel, Wath-upon-Dearne, South Yorkshire, were dismissive and told them: 'What do you expect for a cheap wedding?' 'We booked a three course meal for 65 guests and there was a 45 minute delay from the top table being served and the rest. 'The . food was disgusting. The staff were very arrogant, disorganised and . unprofessional and the owner was very rude when we complained. All our . happy memories for that day are just wiped out.' Mrs Cutts said the hotel was 'nasty' when they complained two days later. She said: 'We realised at the time that things were going wrong but we didn't realise just how bad until the next day or two because the guests were trying to keep the worst away from us because they knew we would be so upset.' The couple say that out of the 65 guests, 19 sent the food back, some of which was raw according to the couple. The couple claim Champagne they had paid for was not served and some of the guests were not served the food that should have been, while those who were faced long delays . Mrs Cutts added that fish fingers for . children were frozen and said other guests even took pictures of the . food because it was so bad. Mrs Cutts posted comments on the travel website Tripadvisor after the wedding saying: 'Booked our wedding reception at the Sandygate. Complete disaster from start to finish. 3 course meal and food was disgusting. Some meals were served frozen, very unprofessional, arrogant staff and owner doesn't have a clue!! 'I wouldn't recommend the Sandygate to anyone, I'm disgusted at how we've been treated and the response to our complaint was ""what do you expect from a cheap wedding"" well for one it's the price they quoted for what we wanted and secondly what we received wasn't fit for a dog. Mrs Cutts said when she complained the owner of the hotel told her she had spent £5,000 on her own wedding . 'I'm heart broken that we booked there, they ruined the best day of my life. Stay away please don't let them ruin your day.' Mrs Cutts said she eventually spoke to the owner who told her she had spent £5,000 on her own wedding. She said: 'We had booked with the previous owner and paid £50 deposit which we lost. 'When we went to see the new owner and told her what we wanted she gave us that price. We paid for Champagne but didn't get it. 'They said they had sent the chef home and the wedding organiser and other staff took over but he was still there later. They shouldn't offer a service at any price if they can't do it decently.' Acting manager of the hotel Simon Tarrington said : 'We are aware of the complaints and we will deal with it in our own way. 'But this couple stayed the night at the hotel, had breakfast the next morning and left without making any complaints to the staff. 'It was only a few days later that we had a phone call from them with the complaints. We have had two other wedding receptions and both families said it was the best reception they had ever been to. 'Also we laid on a buffet following a funeral this week. That was a difficult situation for the family but they were so happy with the buffet and service they left a £30 tip for the staff.' The 11-room hotel featured on Channel Five's 'Hotel Inspector' series three years ago, when it was run by Elvis impersonator Dave Elliott and his wife. It was revamped but last year the couple abandoned the hotel as bailiffs moved in.

Prince Charles was last night accused of paying a lower tax rate than his servants. Labour MP Austin Mitchell claimed the Prince of Wales was ‘dodging around’ to avoid tax. He said that by refusing to classify the Duchy of Cornwall property empire as a corporation, Charles did not pay corporation tax like other big profit-making firms. Scroll down for video . Tax: MPs questioned the tax affairs of the Prince of Wales, who visited Bude in Cornwall today with Camilla . Income: Last year the Duchy of Cornwall made £19million in profits for Prince Charles, who met 16-month old Jasmine Marsh and her mum Jessica Marsh, 34, during his annual visit to Cornwall . Mr Mitchell also criticised him for paying too little income tax on the £19million he received from the duchy last year year. He demanded to know why Charles paid . just 23.6 per cent of his income in direct and indirect tax, compared . with an average of 38 per cent paid by the poorest quarter of the . population. Describing the Duchy of Cornwall, . which owns land across the South West and provides Charles with his . income as heir to the throne, as a ‘medieval anomaly’, Mr Mitchell . suggested the only reason it was not registered as a company was so the . Prince could avoid tax. The criticism came as Charles’s . principal private secretary, William Nye, appeared before MPs on the . Commons spending watchdog, the public accounts committee. Chairman Margaret Hodge, who led the . fight against tax-dodging corporations Starbucks and Google, said it was . ‘shockingly wrong’ that the Prince was paying so little tax on the . duchy’s profits. Committee member Mr Mitchell said: ‘It . looks to me that Prince Charles pays a smaller proportion in tax than . any of his domestic servants.’ Mr Nye insisted that Charles actually . paid the top rate of income tax, but because he counts the cost of his . official duties as a business expense against his tax bill, he appears . to pay less as a proportion of his gross income. Mr Nye said he could do this because ‘his business is being the Prince of Wales’. The MPs also criticised Prince Charles for: . Choppy waters: The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall also met local surfers in Bude . Grilling: Public Accounts Committee chairman Margaret Hodge raised questions about the prince's tax affairs with William Nye, Principal Private Secretary to the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall . The Duchy of Cornwall, set up in 1337, enables the heir to the throne to have a separate income from the monarch. This means he does not have to pay corporation tax. However, he does pay income tax. His tax bill during the last financial year was £4.4million, less than a quarter of his £19million income. Quoting from the Duchy’s annual . report, Mr Mitchell said: ‘Prince Charles’s direct tax plus indirect tax . is 24 per cent of his income for 2012 and 23.6 per cent for 2013. The . bottom quartile of households pay direct and indirect taxes as a . percentage of income of 38 per cent and the top quartile pay 33.7 per . cent.’ Questions: The Public Accounts Committee called senior aides to the Prince to explain his tax affairs . Mr Nye said the amount of tax Charles . paid was so low because of the high level of his ‘official expenditure’ racked up when he represents the Queen. This is set against his tax . bill. He added: ‘The Prince of Wales paid . last year at 50 per cent, this year at 45 per cent. He pays income tax . on his income after relevant business expenses. That is what is laid . out... by the Government. It’s been that way since the Prince of Wales . and the Queen first started paying income tax 20 years ago, so his . official expenditure, which he chooses to use his private income to . meet, is the equivalent of business expenses for someone else who has a . business. ‘Those costs are before tax and he pays income tax on the amount after those official expenses. ‘So if you just take the income before . the official expenses and divide by the tax you will get the figures . you were giving but that doesn’t give the whole story.’ Mr Mitchell said . of the duchy: ‘You are really dodging around because for tax purposes . it’s not a corporation but for every other purpose it is a corporation.’ Mr Nye replied: ‘I don’t think it’s a corporation in the way in which you say. ‘The Duke of Cornwall owns an estate. But... Parliament hasn’t set it up as a company or a corporation. ‘It’s a private estate and it’s run as a private estate.’ The world’s press has been camped outside the Lindo Wing of St Mary’s Hospital in London for a fortnight, and social media is continually awash with rumours that the Duchess of Cambridge has gone into labour. But yesterday the Duchess of Cornwall dropped a tantalising hint that the wait could soon be over, telling well-wishers she expects the little boy or girl to arrive by the ‘end of the week’. Camilla let slip the secret during a visit to a children’s hospice near St Austell in Cornwall. As she gave an impromptu speech to the assembled guests, she said: ‘We are all just waiting by the telephone. ‘We are hopeful that by the end of the week he or she will be here.’ A Clarence House spokesman later confirmed the comment.  William and Kate’s private office at Kensington Palace has refused to confirm the duchess’s exact due date, although Kate herself let slip during a public walkabout earlier this year that it is ‘mid July’. Sources have told the Daily Mail that her due date was in fact yesterday. It is understood that William now has a few days off from his job as an RAF Search and  Rescue pilot in North Wales, which he will spend with his wife at their Kensington Palace residence. Kate stayed at her parents’ house in Berkshire this weekend, while William played in two long-standing charity polo matches.","Senior Royal aides grilled by MPs who challenged Google and Starbucks .

Closure: Stanbridge Earls School has announced it will close in December and another school is due to take over the site . Pupils at a school which is the focus of 'Lord of the Flies' abuse claims abseiled naked while teachers watched, it has been reported. Stanbridge Earls School, which is currently embroiled in a police investigation into alleged sexual abuse of pupils, announced yesterday it will close in December and another school has been lined up to take over the site. But today it was revealed that Ofsted inspectors carrying out emergency visits to the school were told three male pupils had been naked during a school trip to the Rua Fiola Island Exploration Centre in Oban. Inspectors heard two female members of staff watched while the boys abseiled and allegedly took photographs of them during the May half-term trip. The incident has been reported to police by the special needs school's headteacher Maggie McMurray, the Sunday Times reported. The Department for Education confirmed the county council and police were investigating the situation at the school, where a 15-year-old girl was sexually abused by fellow pupils. A spokesman said:  'We have just received advice from Ofsted following an inspection that took place last week. 'Ministers are studying that advice and will announce their decisions about regulatory action very soon.  It would be wrong to take any decisions until we have studied their findings, but all options remain open.' The Charity Commission, the independent regulator of charities in England and Wales, has opened astatutory inquiry into Stanbridge Earls School. A spokesman for the adventure centre told MailOnline that it had 'an unblemished record' for child protection in the 38 years it had been run as a family business. 'Considering the special needs nature of the school, our on-site instructor was looking for a lead from the two female members of the teaching staff who were present throughout this incident,' he added. 'While neither intervened, he saw his primary concern as being for the boys’ health and safety during the climb. 'This was an awkward and very regrettable incident but there was certainly no harm done to the children. 'This was an awkward and very regrettable incident but there was certainly no harm done to the children.' - Spokesman for the Rua Fiola Island Exploration Centre in Oban . 'We have however contacted the police about the incident to offer our full support on any follow up inquiries. 'We are also further clarifying our existing guidelines for our staff to ensure intervening action is taken should we ever see a repeat of an incident like this in future.' On Friday Mrs McMurray wrote to parents announcing Stanbridge Earls' planned closure. She said the school, in Hampshire, had 'for some considerable time now been experiencing many difficulties... most of which are a legacy of past events'. She said the school had seen a drop in numbers after a number of local authorities stopped placing pupils at the school, leading it into financial difficulties. Ofsted was due to report on its findings following an 'unannounced inspection' last week, according to investigative news website Exaro. The school's announcement comes as a major police investigation continues into allegations that a 15-year-old girl was raped and a 12-year-old girl stripped and sexually assaulted by male pupils. Detectives are also investigating if the school perverted the course of justice, amid claims pupils were ordered not to report incidents to anyone outside the school. The mother of the 15-year-old has compared behaviour at the school to the classic novel Lord of the Flies, by William Golding, in which children stranded on an island without adults torment each other with savage cruelty. 'Financial difficulties': The headteacher said it had seen a drop in numbers after a number of local authorities stopped placing pupils there . Earlier this year a tribunal ruled that the school had discriminated against a pupil, who suffered 'appalling abuse' at the hands of another student. It found a number of staff members . failed to tell the youngster’s parents that she had complained of pain . in an intimate part of her body. And it said the school had been 'unsystematic, unprofessional, ad hoc and completely inadequate' when it came to protecting her. The Special Educational Needs and . Disability Tribunal awarded the girl's family £85,000 after ruling the . school failed to respond properly to her allegations of sexual abuse by . other boys at the school. The . tribunal was damning of the school’s then head teacher Peter Trythall, saying he 'failed to recognise that non-consensual sex is actually rape.' Mr Trythall stepped down from his role in April this year and was replaced by Mrs McMurray. Stanbridge . Earls is an independent special school for 190 children with learning . difficulties. It takes boarders aged 10 to 19, and charges between . £25,000 and £39,000 a year. One parent told Exaro: 'I hope that lessons can truly be learnt. We are delighted, although saddened, at the school’s closure.' The new school is due to be a sister establishment to Gard'ner Memorial's More House School, in Surrey.","Three male pupils 'abseiled naked' on Stanbridge Earls School trip to Oban .

A police spokesman 'routine inspection' found that the woman is carrying a Mexican passport in the name of Marcela Silvia Montano Mancera, who was born in the Federal District on May 2, 1968, Yahoo reported. The Mexican citizen, is being watched by officers but as she has not committed a crime, cannot be arrested, Federal Police told Yahoo. Airport authorities cannot understand why she hasn't left the airport and returned home. The Global Post says that the woman has been heard talking to herself in both Spanish and English.

He claimed he was expelled from Iran in 1977 for protests against the Shah and after a long battle, involving applications in several countries, was finally given refugee status, so he could choose any European country. He embarked on a trip to England, claimed he was mugged and had his documents stolen, was allowed to fly from Paris but promptly returned. Because of a lack of proof about his situation, he was arrested for attempting to enter the country illegally and lost papers meant the French had no country of origin which they could return him to. The police returned him to the confines of the airport, and he lived there until he was hospitalised for a condition.

A dying 23-year-old mother married her partner in a hospital chapel after GPs repeatedly failed to spot that she was suffering from cancer. Iveta Kelesova, from Brixton in south London, married Mikulas Keles, 24, at the Royal Marsden Hospital’s chapel in May. She died just days later. The couple’s two-year-old daughter, Victoria, acted as a bridesmaid. Iveta Kelesova, 23, married Mikulas Keles, 24, at the Royal Marsden Hospital's chapel in May. She died just days later from cancer which was so advanced that doctors could not work out where it originated . Mrs Kelesova first visited her doctor at the end of last summer suffering from a persistent cough, night sweats, and pains in her limbs. During the following six months she returned to her doctor more than ten times to ask for help but her husband said that she was always told that she was healthy, and that there was nothing wrong with her. Mrs Kelesova used the female version of her husband's surname, Keles. Mr Keles said: ‘Iveta went to the doctor many times and he only joked “She is a healthy woman, she will never be strong like you though”, but it wasn’t right. I knew she was very ill.’ Eventually, Mrs Kelesova developed dizziness and breathlessness and lost one and a half stone. She was finally referred to the Accident and Emergency department at King’s College Hospital, in Denmark Hill, south London, on March 28 this year. Mrs Kelesova is pictured with the couple's daughter, Victoria, shortly before she fell ill . Mrs Kelesova (pictured with her husband and their daughter, Victoria, two) visited her doctor repeatedly for six months suffering from night sweats, pain, and a persistent cough but was told she was healthy . At the hospital she was diagnosed with . adenocarcinoma – a cancer originating in the glandular tissue - which . was so advanced that doctors were unable to establish where it . originated. By the time she was diagnosed it had spread to her bones and lymph nodes and was incurable. She was transferred to the Royal Marsden Hospital, in Sutton, for treatment. Mr Keles said: ‘It was a big shock. Suddenly they said she had cancer and was very sick and we that we had to go to another hospital. ‘Iveta was in so much pain. How can my doctor have seen her like that and say she was healthy?’ Knowing that she did not have long to live, the couple decided to marry in the hospital’s chapel. The wedding took place on May 2. Mrs Kelesova was eventually diagnosed with adenocarcinoma - a cancer originating in the glandular tissue - when she was referred to the A&E at King's College Hospital in south London . Speaking about the wedding, Mr Keles said: 'Iveta looked beautiful but very tired and I was worried she would close her eyes and go at any time' Mr Keles said: ‘It was so hard. Everyone was trying to smile but it was a sad occasion really. ‘Iveta looked beautiful but very tired and I was worried she would close her eyes and go at any time.’ Mrs Kelesova died on May 15. Her husband said: ‘It is so hard. Iveta used to look after [our daughter] Victoria and I would work to support them as well as my mother and father who are unwell. ‘Now I have to look after Victoria but we still need money and there are still bills to pay. ‘Victoria is cheeky and naughty and she reminds me of Iveta very much. She has a good spirit.’ Mr Keles says that Victoria cries every time she sees a picture of her mother and that she did not like seeing her in hospital. He says that she is very cheeky and reminds him of his wife . When Mrs Kelesova was in hospital Mr Keles stayed by her bedside every day and every night sleeping in a chair. He says that he held her hand to make her feel safe . He added: ‘Victoria cries every time she sees a picture of Iveta, which breaks my heart. ‘She didn’t like it in the hospital at all and was sad seeing her mum with all the wires. She understands that Iveta has gone up to heaven but she misses her very much. ‘In the hospital I stayed next to Iveta every day and night. I slept in the chair next to her bed with my hand on hers to make her happy, keep her safe.’ The couple, who are originally from Slovakia, have been supported by CLIC Sargent which is the UK’s leading cancer charity for children, young people, and their families. Dara de Burca, CLIC Sargent Director of Services, said: 'Clearly, this is a tragic case. But unfortunately, we frequently hear from young people that they made repeated visits to their GP over weeks or months before being diagnosed. 'Cancer in young people is rare, so it’s often difficult for GPs to recognise the symptoms in patients. 'On average, a GP will see only one case in their career. Support for GPs must be improved – key to this is providing them with better information and resources so they can spot these rare cases. Getting young patients diagnosed earlier would save lives.'

The South Beach, Florida, mansion once owned by Italian designer Gianni Versace - and the place he was fatally shot - is headed for the auction block. The extravagant ten-bedroom home, known as Casa Casuarina, was originally built in 1930 and features a 54-foot long mosaic pool . lined with 24-karat gold, numerous frescos, ornate . statues, arched doorways and an open air courtyard. Fisher Auction Company is handling the sale, which is scheduled for September 17. Scroll down for video . Sold! Gianni Versace's former home in South Beach, known by most as Casa Casuarina, was sold at auction today to the firm behind fashion label Jordache for $41.5million . Design marvel: Though the designer behind Villa by Barton G, refurbished the 23,000 square foot space, the style is very much in keeping with the lavish tastes of its former owner . Palatial: Peter Loftin, a telecom entrepreneur, bought the mansion in 2000 and resided there before its conversion into a boutique hotel in 2009 . The 23,000-square-foot mansion had . previously been listed for $125million, before the price was slashed in . November to $100million, and again in May to $75million. In 1997, the 50-year-old Versace was . killed in front of the property by a man who later committed suicide. Tourists can still routinely be spotted taking photos in front of the . house. The property had been operating as a ten-room boutique hotel but had closed. The . house - whose most recent owner was telecoms magnate Peter Loftin - had . its asking price cut by $50million after failing to find a buyer for . more than a year. He initially asked $125million for . the property, making it the most expensive house on the market when it . was first put up for sale a year ago. Bargain! The mansion had previously been listed for $125million, before the price was slashed in November to $100million, and again in May to $75million. Its last asking price before auction was $50million . Expansion: The home was totally remodelled by Versace himself after he fell in love with the property . Unique: There are not many homes as utterly lavish as the house where Versace lived until his death . Pool: But only an extravagant multi-millionaire could afford to buy the Miami Beach mansion . Dark past: It was outside this house where legendary designer Versace was killed by a lone gunman . But in November he was forced to take $25million off the asking price, and he then lowered it by another $25million six months later. Mr . Loftin bought the luxury mansion in 2000, three years after Versace's . murder, and converted the residence into a boutique hotel and private . club in 2009. Those who have toured the incredible . property maintain that the once gold-lined swimming pool and museum quality . frescoes are just a few of the lavish features that contribute to the . hefty price tag. In fact, such is its value, property experts refer to the luxurious villa as a 'trophy property'. Boutique: The Versace motif remains on the floor of one of the hotel suites, a tribute to the designer who spent $33million renovating and expanding the property after he bought it in 1992 . Prints and patterns: The villa was originally built in the 1930s by architect Alden Freeman as an homage to the oldest existing house in the western hemisphere in Santo Domingo . Lavish: The hotel still features the murals and frescoes painted on the walls and ceilings by Mr Versace, a detail that contributes to the hefty price tag . Ocean view: Villa by Barton G looks out onto the Atlantic from its Miami Beach location, an exclusive section of the South Beach strip . A step in the wrong direction: Mr Versace was tragically killed at the entrance to Casa Casuarina in 1997 by Andrew Cunanan who committed suicide shortly after . The now legendary Italian designer . bought Casa Casuarina in 1992 for just under $10million after supposedly passing by and falling in love with it. Originally built in the 1930s by architect Alden Freeman, the Miami Beach property was somewhat dilapidated until Versace invested $33million into restoring and improving it. Once an architect himself, the . flamboyant designer added a 6,100-square-foot south wing and a 54-foot pool . lined with 24 karat gold. Illuminating: A skylight brightens up the original interior designed by Gianni Versace in the famously ornate home that he bought in 1992 after falling in love with the property . Grandeur: The couturier added a 6,100-square-foot south wing to the property and covered the courtyard in thousands upon thousands of individual mosaic tiles . Guest suite? The property cost Mr Versace $10million and though he plugged $33million of his own money into its renovation, after his death his family made a quick sale for only $20million to its most recent owner . Residential palace: The one-acre property features ten bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, seven fireplaces, a garage for 12 cars and a guesthouse . The impressive courtyard he covered in thousands upon thousands of individual mosaic tiles while elaborate . frescoes were painted across the property's walls and ceilings. Icon: Missed by the fashion world, the late Gianni Versace was once an architect . Indeed it was Versace's pride . and joy until the fateful June day of 1997 when Andrew Cunanan . assassinated him in cold blood on the very steps of the house. When Donatella Versace scrambled to sell . off the designer's assets, Mr Loftin gained from a quick bargain and . bought the villa for a cool $20million. After residing there himself for a . number of years, he turned the opulent property into a boutique hotel. The property is now known as Villa . by Barton G after the events impresario Barton G Weiss who renovated and re-styled it . Nowadays, according to the hotel's website, the decor 'takes up style where fashion designer Gianni Versace left off.' Boasting 23,400 square feet, the ornate . house includes seven fireplaces, a guest house and a parking garage . large enough for a dozen cars, and all within a one acre plot. For the past three years hotel guests have enjoyed the surrounding attractions of Miami's historic Art Deco district while re-energizing from the day poolside or in one of two of the residence's lounges.

Ban: Cllr Stuart Towner, who was sacked from his job at a boarding school for an affair with a 17-year-old pupil, leaves court after being banned for drink driving with his children in the car . A Tory councillor who was sacked from his caretaker job at a top boarding school for an affair with a sixth former has been banned from driving after he was caught twice over the limit with his children in his car. Magistrates heard how District Councillor Stuart Towner, 38, had been thrown out of the family home by his wife when she found out about the affair. Days later he was stopped by police with his 10 and 12-year-old children in the passenger seats. He was handed a 20-month driving ban and . ordered to pay costs and a £100 fine after he admitted the . offence at Hastings Magistrates’ Court. Towner had begun work as a caretaker at St Bede's independent school in Hailsham, East Sussex, in August last year. The job came with a house and as a . result the father-of-two moved his family into the school property and . rented out their own home. However, his employment at the school . came to an abrupt end in March this year when his affair with a . 17-year-old sixth form student came to light. The Conservative was elected to . Wealden District Council in 2011 and also sits as a member of Hailsham . Town Council in East Sussex. But he has only attended two out of the last nine council meetings, and given apologies for his absence on just three occasions. Council records show the last Wealden District Council meeting Towner attended in his role as councillor was in early March. Today the school . confirmed Towner had worked for them and was dismissed for an 'inappropriate relationship'. As a result of his affair with the . teenager, the family lost the caretaker's house which came with his job and Towner was made homeless when his wife Shelly threw him out. Sources said in the days after he went to council officers demanding to be re-homed and went drinking the day after. Fired: Towner was a caretaker at St Bede's School in Hailsham before he lost his job over an 'inappropriate relationship' with a sixth former . Prosecutor Jeremy King told . magistrates: 'On May 23 this year at around 8.30pm, police received . reports of a possible drink-driver in the Eastbourne area, the car being . a green Volkswagen Polo. 'Officers saw the green Volkswagen . travelling eastbound on Eastbourne Road, Pevensey Bay. Police followed . that vehicle which proceeded to turn into Collier Road, where it was . stopped. 'Officers noted at the time the . defendant had two children in the car - one in the front and one in the . back. One was a 10-year-old, and the other a daughter who was 12 years . old. 'When officers spoke to Mr Towner, they . noticed his breath smelled of alcohol. The officers then conducted a . roadside breath test which was failed. 'He was arrested and taken to a police . station were another breath test gave the reading of 73 micrograms of . alcohol per 100 millilitres, which of course is more than twice the . legal limit of 35 micrograms.' Maxine Buck, defending, . said her client, who had no previous convictions, had fallen on hard . times and began drinking heavily after his wife kicked him out. She added: 'Before . today, Mr Towner was a man of good character. He appears before you . having suffered a great deal of bad fortune, which led up to this . offence occurring. 'He is deeply ashamed. He recognised instantly what he’d done was wrong at the time.' - Maxine Buck, defending . 'He has recently lost his job and his . wife left him, taking the children. At the time this offence was . committed, he was about to be evicted from his property. 'As a result of losing his job and the . deterioration of his relationship, he began to rely on drinking alcohol. Unfortunately, it turned in to an addiction and therefore he was . drinking every day. 'He is deeply ashamed. He recognised instantly what he’d done was wrong at the time. 'He made a woeful decision to take his children in the car when he had been drinking. 'Bearing in mind he was suffering from . depression and his reliance on alcohol, he just was not able to realise . how woeful that decision was.' Ms Buck said a friend was helping Towner . to 'get back on his feet' and was willing to give him a job with a . roofing company 'if he gets his act together'. She added: 'Mr Towner is not in receipt of any benefits, although I’ve advised him he should do that. 'He has been relying on savings. He is . currently homeless. All he has is some loose change in his pocket and . that is literally it. He has exhausted all of his savings. 'He is seeing his GP every Monday, dealing with his alcohol problem. Tragic: The inquest, at Hastings Magistrates' Court, heard she had joined an informal gathering of people for a paddle on Christmas Day morning after reading about it on Facebook . 'Prior to this sad turn of events, this was a man who was in employment, was paying taxes and was not a heavy drinker. 'He wants to be given the opportunity to . demonstrate to his daughter that he can be a responsible father. He is . fighting to get himself back on the right track and is sorting himself . out.' Towner remained expressionless in the dock, wearing a black quilted jacket, red checked shirt and grey jeans, as his sentence was read out. Magistrate Francesca Nowne said: 'We are going to disqualify you from driving for 20 months. That means . you will not get your licence back until February 23, 2015.' Towner was also ordered to pay £85 costs, a £100 fine and a £20 victim surcharge fee. A spokesman for Bede’s independent school said: 'I can confirm Stuart Towner was employed by the school from August 2012 until March 2013 when he was dismissed for an inappropriate relationship with a sixth form student who is 17 years old.

The biggest theft in the history of the Cannes Film Festival was 'almost certainly' an inside job, police revealed yesterday. The news came as detectives confirmed that the hotel safe from which jewellery worth £1 million was taken was not insured. Officers are also continuing to question an American woman working for Chopard, the Swiss jeweller and festival sponsor, who was keeping the items in her second-floor room at the Cannes Novotel. Scroll down for video . Stllen: More than £1million worth of jewellery designed to be worn by stars on the red carpet at Cannes was stolen as thieves made off with an entire safe-full today. Those seen wearing Chopard jewellery at this year’s festival have included Julianne Moore, left, and Cindy Crawford, right . Celebrity favourite: Cara Delevingne was snapped wearing expensive jewellery from the brand at The Great Gatsby premiere on the opening night of the festival, but these are not thought to be the particular jewels that are missing . She was said to have been enjoying a . champagne-fuelled night out on the town when a thief tore the small safe . from a cupboard in the early hours of Friday morning. A police source said: 'It is very . suspicious that the thief went straight to the right room, had the time . to calmly remove the safe, and then make their escape unseen. We are . almost certainly dealing with an inside job.' Chopard has 40 staff at Cannes whose . job it is to persuade stars to wear its products. Julianne Moore, Cindy . Crawford and Cara Delevingne have been seen wearing Chopard pieces this . year. The company has been trying to play . down the theft, insisting that the jewellery stolen was worth much less . than £1 million and was not intended to be worn by any stars. The jewellery had been designed to be . worn by stars on the red carpet. The theft came as the upmarket resort . on the French Riviera hosts its annual film festival featuring actors . including Leonardo DiCaprio and Carey Mulligan. ‘The break-in was at the Novotel in the centre of town,’ said a police source. ‘The room was said to be empty, and the safe was taken off the wall, before being removed.’ Detectives originally estimated loss at ‘around 775 000 euros’, but it was later claimed to be over £1million. The link to some of Hollywood's biggest stars will also add to the value on the black market. Scene of the crime: Police stand guard outside the Suite Novotel Cannes Centre hotel where £1million of Chopard jewellery has been stolen . Commandant Bernard Mascarelli, of the Nice police, . confirmed that the entire safe was screwed off the wall and then taken away. The room is on the second floor – meaning the thieves . would have had to transport the safe out of the building while keeping it . hidden. CCTV film at the Suite Novotel was tonight being . examined by detectives, who also confirmed that an American woman who is Chopard employee had . been staying in the room. She is being questioned by police. ‘She went out for dinner at around 8pm and didn’t get . back until very late the next morning,’ said another police source.  ‘When she got back, the safe was gone.’ Chopard hands out jewellery to stars for an evening in . an arrangement which allows everyone to gain valuable publicity. This year there is a Chopard team of no less than 40 . people in Cannes whose job it is to persuade the rich and famous to ‘borrow’ their jewellery when they go out on the town. The jewellery firm is this year promoting a collection . called ‘Red Carpet’, which actresses including Britain’s Emma Watson are . encouraged to wear.Miss Watson is, by coincidence, starring in The Bling Ring. On display: A set of jewels, new pieces of the 'Green Carpet Collection', presented by luxury brand Chopard during the 66th Cannes Film Festival in Cannes . Chophard has provided the Palme d'Or trophy awarded to . the director of the best feature film for the past 15 years. It features a . 24-carat gold palm attached to a piece of cut crystal. Chopard is one of the official . sponsors of the 66th annual film festival - it designs the Palme d’Or . (Gold Palm) award, and creates all the jewellery for the ‘walking up the . red carpeted steps’ ritual which is broadcast across the world every . year. Cannes is notorious for jewellery thefts, with organised gangs frequently targeting boutiques and hotels. Many turn of the raids turn out to be inside jobs, with staff helping the thieves to locate and then steal items. Those seen wearing Chopard jewellery at this year’s festival have included Julianne Moore, Cindy Crawford and Cara Delevingne. Last year, the company’s ambassadors included Eva Herzigova, Jessica Chastain, Reese Witherspoon and Marion Cotillard. Today detectives were inspecting the second floor room at the Novotel hotel for clues. The Chopard employee, who has not been identified, was also being questioned. The Novotel Hotel is situated across the road from the municipal police headquarters in Cannes. In May 2009, a Chopard boutique on the Place Vendome in Paris was raided and more than 6 million pounds worth of jewellery taken. A man was eventually sentenced to eight years in prison in connection with the crime, but the jewellery was never recovered.","Detectives said hotel safe from which jewels were stolen was not insured .

Every member of staff at a cash-strapped council has been given a share of a £852,000 bonus pot, it emerged today. Suffolk County Council, which has over seen budget cuts of millions of pounds, signed off the £250 windfall for each of its 3,731 administration staff. Critics condemned the move as ‘bonkers’ as council leaders claimed it would save money in the long run. Bonus time: Tory-led Suffolk County Council signed off the £250 payments to staff despite losing millions in budget cuts . Full-time staff are in line for £250 with part-time workers receiving a payment on a pro-rata basis. It was never discussed at an official council meeting but was agreed informally by cabinet members and senior managers. The council claims the bonus was agreed, partly to compensate staff for the end of its incremental pay increases where workers used to get an additional pay rise for each year’s service. Robert Oxley, the campaign manager for the Taxpayers Alliance, said: ‘It’s shocking that the council is paying out bonuses, regardless of what they want to try and call them. ‘It’s bonkers that the council acknowledges the financial pressures it faces yet still deems it sensible to hand already well paid staff a bonus and a pay rise. ‘The council needs to cut out wasteful and unnecessary spending so they can ease the pressure on hard pressed residents footing the local authority’s pay bill.’ Council leaders claimed the move will save move . Only officials working in the main administration will get the bonus, with specialists like teachers or firefighters left out. Suffolk County Council leader Mark Bee said: ‘Making this one-off payment very much marks the end of incremental salary increases which can cost an authority of our size significant sums of money. ‘This payment is being made on a pro-rata basis. As the majority of our staff are part-time, they will not receive the full amount. ‘In the long run, the changes we are making to staff pay will save the authority money.’ However, Sandy Martin, the Labour leader on the council, said: ‘I am surprised that this was not on the agenda to be discussed before it was decided - especially as we are always hearing what a financial black hole we are staring into. ‘Quite honestly if there is this money available I would rather have seen it use to benefit the lowest-paid staff, to introduce the living wage. ‘While £250 is a good sum, it will not be that much for people on more than £25,000, but if this money was spent to lift the wages of those at the bottom it could have made a real difference - but there was no chance to discuss the decision.’ A spokesman for Suffolk County Council said: ‘This payment is in recognition of our employees’ on-going commitment to the authority during what continues to be a challenging time for local government. ‘It is also against the background of the removal of all incremental salary increases. Corporate single status staff will also receive a 1 per cent cost of living increase in their salary. ‘This is in line with a national agreement between unions and employers.’","Suffolk County Council agreed £250 payments for every staff member .

The Government's chief medical officer will warn today that resistance to antibiotics is one of the greatest threats to modern health. It comes a day after Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said  there are 'few' public health issues of greater importance than antimicrobial resistance. Medical experts from around the globe need to work together to try to tackle the 'catastrophic threat' of antibiotic resistance, he said. Dame Sally Davies (left) and Jeremy Hunt have both warned of the 'catastrophic threat' of antibiotic resistance . Addressing the World Health Assembly in . Geneva, Switzerland, Dame Sally is expected to say: 'If we don't take . action, in 20 years' time we could be back in the 19th century where . infections kill us as a result of routine operations.' Many of the drugs are being used unnecessarily for mild infections or illnesses which should not be treated with antibiotics - which is helping to create resistance, Professor Dame Sally Davies will say. The Government is now preparing a five-year plan to make sure antibiotics are prescribed responsibly. Dr Margaret Chan, director-general of the World Health Organisation, told The Daily Telegraph: . 'Health care cannot afford a setback of this magnitude. We must recognise, and respon to, the very seirous threat of antimicrobial resistance.' According to Dame Sally, there are two reasons for the problem. The first is that we are massively overusing antibiotic drugs, which effectively teaches bacteria how to resist them. The second is that pharmaceutical companies are not working hard to produce any new antibiotics because they are not seen as profitable. Professor Dame Sally said many of the drugs are being used unnecessarily for mild infections or illnesses which should not be treated with antibiotics . Earlier this year she said: ‘We . haven’t had a new class of antibiotics since the late Eighties, and . there are very few antibiotics in the pipeline of the big pharmaceutical . companies. British . doctors say there are two particularly pressing dangers: the lung . disease tuberculosis and the sexually transmitted infection gonorrhoea. In January, for example, experts from London University tested samples taken from 18 lavatories in public buildings in the capital. The Government is now preparing a five-year plan to make sure antibiotics are prescribed responsibly . Scientific tests, reported in the respected journal PloS One, found high levels of the potentially lethal Staphylococcus bacteria — and more than a third of these were resistant to commonly used antibiotics. The study reinforces previous scientific research which warns that drug-resistant forms of bacteria are building up in the environment, largely because of the fact that we are consuming so many antibiotics at home and in hospital, then flushing them into our water systems. There, bacteria can ‘learn’ how to become immune to them. But worse still, bacteria are also ‘learning’ how to resist drugs while they are inside our bodies because of the over-prescription of drugs. In February researchers in the British Medical Journal estimated that nearly one in 20 prescriptions for antibiotics is actually unnecessary. Doctors are handing out 1.6 million needless courses every year. Experts place much of the blame for this problem on pushy parents. And patients frequently insist on antibiotics to treat colds and flu, despite the fact that these illnesses are caused by viruses and not bacteria. Last November, the ECDC wrote to all family doctors to warn them of the implications of routinely giving patients  antibiotics because every single unnecessary prescription increases the risk of bacteria becoming resistant to treatment. China is the world’s biggest producer and consumer of antibiotics in the world, with at least 46 per cent of antibiotics being used in livestock . Rapid global transport systems means that any of these new super-infections can travel the world in days.","Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has warned there are 'few' public health issues of greater importance .

American scientists have transformed people into cows using immersive virtual reality programmes with the aim of persuading them to eat less meat . American scientists have transformed people into cows using immersive virtual reality programmes with the aim of persuading them to eat less meat. The University of Stanford's Virtual Human Interaction Lab allows people to step into a cow's hooves for a surreal experience. The hi-tech computer software subjects humans to being virtually poked with cattle prods and eventually dragged to a virtual slaughterhouse. Researcher Jeremy Bailenson hopes that participants find the experience so moving that they emphathise with the cattle and choose to eat less meat as a result. The thinking behind the project is that you remember what it is like to face being taken to slaughterhouse, even in a virtual world. And as a result, you might choose a vegetarian dish for dinner. The implications of such an experience are huge as eating less meat translates into less energy consumption, Vice.com reported. As well as turning people vegetarian, the researchers hope that the experience will also make participants think about how their behaviour on a daily basis contributes towards climate change. It is not the first time the researchers have used virtual reality technology to make people aware of their impact on the environment. Individuals who virtually cut down trees said they thought about the experience later and reduced their paper usage. The Virtual . Human Interaction Lab is designed to 'harness the emotive power of . empathy' and although it uses modern technology, the theory is not new. Animal groups have previously used many tactics to create emotional understanding between humans and the animals they eat. On the simplest level, leaflets are designed to match pictures of beguiling animals with shocking facts that tug on the heartstrings. But still images and statistics have a relatively short-term effect, according to the researchers. The University of Stanford's Virtual Human Interaction Lab subjects humans to being virtually poked with cattle prods and eventually dragged to a virtual slaughterhouse like some real cows . It is thought that animal sanctuaries are much more successful as they not only rescue farm animals, but encourage people to interact with them. The sanctuaries hope that as people interact with the animals, they might recognise them as individuals with personalities, not just meat and change their actions. The same is true with this latest experiment. The scientists said that becoming the animals in a virtual world and stepping into their hooves was a natural extension of this idea and a new way of encouraging people to empathise.","American scientists are giving people the chance to step into a cow's hooves using immersive virtual reality programmes .

A California doctor who duped patients out of more than $1 million after claiming her herbal supplements could cure cancer has been jailed for 14 years. Christine Daniel charged patients up to $100,000 for six months of treatment, which she claimed could also cure diabetes and multiple sclerosis. 'Daniel robbed victims of more than money â€“ she also stole their hopes and dreams for a cure,' U.S. Attorney Andre Birotte Jr. said after the doctor was sentenced. Fraud: Dr Christine Daniel has been jailed after conning patients out of money for her herbal cancer cure . The 58-year-old was also ordered to pay back nearly $1.3 million, by U.S. District Judge Robert Timlin, who sentenced her over four counts of mail and wire fraud, six counts of tax evasion and one count of witness tampering. The doctor and Pentecostal minister claimed her natural cancer treatment had a 60 to 80 per cent chance of success for advanced stages of the disease. Claims that the supplements were natural and blended specifically for individual patients were found to be false in court. It actually contained sunscreen preservative, beef extract flavoring and other ingredients that would not have any effect on cancer or other diseases, expert testimony proved. Some of the Los Angeles doctor's patients died from complications after taking her supplement, including Paula Middlebrooks, who was charged nearly $60,000, the court was told. After five months Daniel claimed Ms Middlebrooks was free of cancer, and threw her a party. However, the Georgia woman's breast cancer had spread and she died soon after. Debra Harris, whose sister Barbara died after being treated by Daniel, submitted a letter to the court saying: 'I live with the guilt that I should have seen that none of what she was going through was helping her, but instead was hurting her.' It wasn't only Daniel's patients who were convinced they could be cured, Ms Harris said. Their families  'wanted to believe it just as bad,' The Washington Post reported. Another case highlighted during the trial was that of a 22-year-old woman who was suffering from neck lymphoma. Although her condition could be cured, the woman died because Daniel recommended that she should avoid having radiation or chemotherapy. Callous: From her Los Angeles clinic Daniel would prescribe her supplement and advise against chemotherapy . 'Daniel is responsible for a shockingly cold-hearted fraud that has brought her a richly deserved federal prison sentence,' Mr Birotte said in a statement published by the Huffington Post. The court heard from 28 former patients and family members of cancer sufferers who had died. Some told the court they were advised to avoid chemotherapy and to not take pain killers while being treated by Daniel. This led to some spending the last few months of their lives in agony, Cal Coast News reported. Daniel was also accused of trying to influence at least two witnesses at her trial, including a former patient. And, in an attempt to make her clinic, which operated under names including Sonrise Wellness Center, appear as a non-profit organization, Daniel told patients to classify medical service payments as donations. Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Johns said in court documents that Daniels had 'a merciless and callous indifference to the suffering of her patients and their family members'. He added: 'It is unlikely that our federal criminal justice system will see the like of defendant Christine Daniel again.'","California doctor robbed patients of 'hopes and dreams of cure'

'A national health service': Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt (pictured in Downing Street yesterday) wants only permanent British residents to qualify for anything other than emergency care free of charge . The Labour party today dismissed plans to stop foreigners ripping off the NHS as 'xenophobic'. Shadow health minister Diane Abbott claimed limiting access to free healthcare to permanent British residents risked 'stigmatising foreigners' and threatened public health. Under the government's plan, foreigners coming to Britain will have to pay at least £200 to access free hospital care and pay a charge every time they visit a GP. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt wants only permanent British residents to qualify for anything other than emergency care free of charge. He insists Britain has a ‘national health service, not an international health service’. Controversial new proposals, to form a . central part of the Government’s Immigration Bill, will include a new . ‘healthcare levy’ for anyone coming to the UK for more than six months, a . charge to see family doctors for anyone here for less than six months, . and a system to track migrant workers’ use of the NHS. Ministers say non-UK residents are currently granted NHS numbers far too easily, usually after turning up at a GP surgery. On referral to hospital, no further questions about their entitlement to treatment are asked – providing ‘health tourists’ or those who have fallen ill while in this country with unlimited free access to the NHS. The new healthcare levy will be in addition to the visa charge for anyone coming to the UK for more than six months. Currently, short-term migrants coming to the UK either to study or work, with more than six months on their visas, are likely to qualify for free hospital care as soon as they enter the UK. The charge, which ministers expect to be at least £200 a year, will ensure that migrants contribute while not increasing red tape for doctors and nurses. Landlords who fail to check that their . tenants are not illegal immigrants face being fined up to £3,000 under . plans unveiled today. Ministers want to make it more difficult for people without permission to stay in the UK to carry on with their lives. But landlords warn they are not ‘immigration experts’ and cannot be expected to do the work of border police. All private landlords will have to carry out checks on the migration status of every tenant before renting out a room or house. Immigration minister Mark Harper, pictured, said: . ‘The Government is determined to build a fairer system and to address . the public's concern about immigration. ‘ . The fines could be extended to families who take in a lodger. Last night the plan was backed by Liz Kendall, a Labour shadow health minister, who said: . ‘People who are not eligible for free care must pay for the treatment . they receive and be rigorously pursued for the money they owe.’ She stressed that the last Labour government had taken some action on the issue and 'any abuse must be tackled'. But today her colleague Ms Abbott dismissed the plan to stop money being wasted on treatment for people who not qualify. Writing on Twitter she said: 'What price xenophobia? Stigmatising foreigners accessing NHS creates a public health risk.' Labour party sources stressed that Ms Abbott's view was not the official party line. But the extraordinary remark was condemned by the government. Conservative Party Chairman Grant Shapps said: 'Our NHS should be a national health service, not an international health service. That's fair for the hardworking people who pay for it.‬‬ ‪‪ . 'It's bizarre that Labour oppose this. Once again it shows that Ed Miliband is too weak to stand up for hardworking people.' A Tory party source added: 'Diane . Abbott’s comment shows Labour isn’t serious about getting fairness for . the hardworking people whose taxes fund our NHS. 'We are taking action to ensure that people who are supposed to be paying for NHS care do so. 'It’s sad a Labour Shadow Health Minister thinks this is xenophobic.' A government consultation being . launched today will also explore whether migrants should be allowed to . show they have private health insurance as an alternative. Today’s . proposals will also mean foreigners visiting for less than six months . will no longer be able to see a GP for free, with a charge introduced. Split: The plans were backed by one Labour health spokesman but Dian Abbott said they risked stigmatising foreigners . Criticism: Labour's shadow health minister Diana Abbott used Twitter to voice opposition to plans to charge foreigners to use the NHS . Visitors from the EU would continue to . access NHS for free but ministers say they will put in place systems for . recovering the costs from their home countries. Mr Hunt will propose a new . ‘registration and tracking system’ for visitors before they join a GP . surgery, possibly linked to the NHS number. Those . with a ‘questionable’ residency status – meaning they should be billed . for non-emergency NHS care – could be issued with only a temporary NHS . number. This would mean that if they tried to access anything other than accident and emergency departments, they would be charged. Treatment: Currently, short-term migrants coming to the UK either to study or work, with more than six months on their visas, are likely to qualify for free hospital care as soon as they enter the UK (file picture) The Health Secretary will also promise better checks to enforce charges for care in both hospitals and doctors’ surgeries. He . said: ‘We need to ensure that those residing or visiting the UK are . contributing to the system, and that we do as much as possible to target . illegal migration. ‘We are a national health service not an international health service and I am determined to wipe out abuse in the system.’ 'We are a national health service not an international health service and I am determined to wipe out abuse in the system' Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt . However Clare Gerada, who chairs the Council of the Royal College of General Practitioners, warned the measures posed a public health risk and she claimed it could end up costing the taxpayer more. Immigrants with highly infectious conditions could end up ‘wandering around for fear of being charged’ or going to emergency units that were far more expensive to run than doctors' surgeries, she said. ‘What we don't want to do is put people at risk ... not just the migrants but also us,’ she told BBC Radio 4's Today. ‘People use the NHS if they've got infections and we certainly don't want to have people wandering around for fear of being charged at the GP surgery.’ She added: ‘At the moment we are fairly accessible and I think it is important to keep it that way. ‘I don't think we should be turning the GP surgery into a border agency. 'I think we should be making sure that people who do feel that they are ill can come and access us because we certainly don't want people who have got TB or HIV or any other infectious disease, or in fact anybody that believes themselves to be ill, to be frightened of seeing a GP for fear of being charged.’ National AIDS Trust comments on the Government’s consultation on limiting migrant access to the NHS, including charging for primary care. Deborah Jack, chief executive of the National AIDS Trust, added: 'If introduced, these policies will endanger the lives of people living with HIV and threaten the health of our community. 'The proposals, if enforced, would undermine years of work by bodies such as NICE and the British HIV Association to encourage marginalised at-risk groups to access HIV testing and treatment. 'Public health experts agree that access to a GP is essential to reduce rates of undiagnosed and late diagnosed HIV, especially amongst those from black and minority ethnic backgrounds, as they are less likely to go to a sexual health clinic.'","Jeremy Hunt will propose 'registration and tracking system' for visitors .

Journalist Whit Sheppard, 48, sent a letter to Deerfield Academy's head of school Margaret Curtis in June 2012 disclosing details about faculty member Peter Hindle . The man who was the catalyst in exposing a sex scandal at an elite boarding school that counts a king and a Nobel Prize laureate as its alumni today revealed his identity to speak out about the alleged sex attack allegedly at the hands of a trusted and popular teacher. Journalist Whit Sheppard, 48, sent a letter to Deerfield Academy's head of school Margaret Curtis in June 2012, disclosing details about faculty member Peter Hindle, who he said sexually abused him during his senior year in the winter of 1983. The letter sparked an internal investigation at the $50,000-a-year school and another student and member of staff were implicated. A subsequent criminal investigation was also launched and is still underway. Whit penned an essay for the Boston Globe's Sunday magazine detailing what he says happened at the boarding school. He also revealed he wrote to then-headmaster Eric Widmer in 2004 detailing bullying and sexual abuse but nothing was made of it. Reading about the abuse in the Catholic Church and Penn State inspired Whit to again do something about it. That and two other reasons - 'I knew that what had taken place was wrong, and I knew that the truth was with me,' he wrote. 'For years I had hesitated to speak up . because of my own shame and embarrassment about the abuse I had . suffered, the concern that I might not be believed, and the potential . for significant pushback from a legion of Hindle admirers.' After the scandal broke, before Sheppard's identity was revealed, a 'legion of Hindle admirers' did come out to defend their teacher, who was something of a legend at the school and had acquired the nickname 'Czar'. Dave Orrick, who graduated from Deerfield in 1989, told the New York Times of his former teacher: 'He was debonair, he was very well-dressed, his hair was well-parted, he had a gentlemanly way about him. 'A guy like Peter Hindle seemed to have a level of wisdom, and a level of openness and warmth that I think a lot of people actually gravitated to.' Allegations: Deerfield Academy, a $50,000-a-year school in Franklin County, Massachusetts, pictured, has notified police after an ex-student claimed retired maths teacher, Peter Hindle, had 'sexual contact' with him in the 1980s . In January, the school in Franklin County, Massachusetts, alerted students, alumni and their . parents with a notice on its website and a letter, stating the former teacher had admitted to inappropriate relations with students . during his 44-year tenure. The school's letter, which was signed by Philip Greer, the president of the board, and Margarita Curtis, said: 'The Board of Trustees has determined to rename the Peter G. Hindle ’52 Schoolmaster’s Chair, remove his name from the school’s squash facility, and forbid him from attending events on campus.' However the 78-year-old, who taught at the school from 1956 to 2000, told the Boston Herald he will dispute the allegations, saying he only 'gave someone a back rub' and that sexual conduct was 'all in interpretation'. But Whit Sheppard paints a very different version of events. Admitting that he was very fond of . the teacher from the get go, he said of Hindle: 'I was struck by . his charisma and all-around aura of coolness. 'I suppose I hoped that some of it . might rub off on my adolescent self when I was in his orbit. He had a . way of fixing his gaze on you that was disarming.' The alleged abuse started midway . through the fall term of his senior year, he said, when Hindle 'initiated an . insistent campaign to give me a back rub'. Famous alumni: The school boasts high profile alumni including the King of Jordan, left, and billionaire David H. Koch, right . He turned him down a few times but said he never suspected anything untoward. 'A highly esteemed ""man’s man"" who . was genuinely interested in the well-being of his charges,' Sheppard wrote. 'He was the . last person I would have suspected of being sexually interested in . adolescent boys, or in me.' He then went on to describe the night he took him up on the back rub and said nothing of a sexual nature occurred at first. It was a month later when he offered him another back rub that the first 'assault' took place. 'He massaged my legs and buttocks and then . masturbated me to climax,' Sheppard details. 'The abuse continued over the next several . weeks, more than eight times, wordless exchanges that escalated to . include Hindle performing fellatio on me. 'I would climax, roll over, and . feign sleep. He would gather himself up, close the door, and walk down . the hallway to his apartment. It was as if nothing had ever happened. 'In hindsight, I believe Hindle . ""groomed"" me over time, fixing upon me because I was troubled, . vulnerable, and craving positive adult attention.' After graduating, Sheppard turned to . alcohol to numb the pain of the abuse before finally seeking help and . going into rehab and then AA. 'I was slugging down drinks by myself . in a Dallas nightclub just hours after leaving Deerfield for the last . time, and the ensuing months were a blur of intoxication, degradation, . and humiliating episodes,' he revealed. He has been sober since 1985. A previous student who came out in defense of Hindle when the accusations first emerged, penning a heartfelt letter of support, commented on Sheppard's story today, saying it 'added an element of undeniable credibility' to the allegations. Prestigious: Taylor Swift's ex-boyfriend Conor Kennedy, right, is a current student and actor Matthew Fox, left, also attended . The school counts Taylor Swift's . ex-boyfriend Conor Kennedy as a student and boasts high profile alumni . including King Abdullah II al-Hussein of Jordan, billionaire . philanthropist David H. Koch, Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes and actor . Matthew Fox. 'I think it's all in interpretation,' he told the Boston Herald of the allegations. 'It depends on what you mean by sexual contact. I gave someone a back rub. I don't even know who it is.' But said he had no idea which former student made the allegations. 'I've given a number (of back rubs) over the years,' he said. 'I can't tell you.' In the school's investigation, they found evidence of similar conduct between Hindle and at least one other student, as well as evidence that a second teacher, Bryce Lambert, had sexual contact with two students. Lambert died in 2007, another teacher who had acquired legendary status. The 600-student school was founded in 1797 and also educated numerous Rockefellers, 1990 Nobel Prize winner physicist Henry W. Kendal and David M. Childs, the architect behind the new One World Trade Center skyscraper in New York. Deerfield Academy, the school now facing claims of 'sexual contact' between a teacher and student in the 1980s, has turned out scores of famous alumni in its 200-year history. The academy is an independent, coeducational boarding school in Deerfield, Massachusetts. A four-year college-preparatory school, it has approximately 600 students and about 100 faculty, all of whom live on or near campus. Alumni include King Abdullah II al-Hussein of Jordan, Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes, billionaire and 1984 Vice Presidential candidate David H. Koch and 1990 Nobel Prize laureate physicist Henry W. Kendal. Deerfield also educated numerous Rockefellas, David M. Childs, the architect behind the new One World Trade Center skyscraper in New York, and actor Matthew Fox as well as scores of congressmen, ambassadors and sports stars. Taylor Swift's former flame and Conor Kennedy is a current student at the school, which costs just under $50,000 a year for boarding students and $35,920 annually for day students.","Deerfield Academy has notified police after Whit Sheppard claimed retired maths teacher Peter Hindle had 'sexual contact' with him in the 1980s .

They are billed as the next must-have gadget for the living room - but experts today warned the latest curved TV sets may not be worth the money. Manufacturers such as LG have shown off curved screens at the CES show in Las Vegas this week, with Samsung even having a ‘shape shifting’ screen that can go from flat to curved at the press of a button. The TV firms say the sets make for a more cinema-like experience. Speaking at the CES exhibition in Las Vegas, experts claim that curved screens may be better suited to smaller devices, used by one person at a time . Joe Stinziano of Samsung said ‘the wider field of view and panoramic effect draws viewers in’. However, the firm has tried to cater to both sides of the market with a ‘bendable TV’. Motors in the back of the TV cause if to bend from flat to curved at the press of a button - although Samsung did not say how much it would cost, or when or if it would become available. ‘It’s all about giving the customer control over their viewing experience,’ Mr Stinziano said, during a keynote most remembered for director Michael Bay walking off stage after claiming his auto cue was broken. Curved TVs are expensive compared to normal flat TVs. For instance, the Samsung's 55-inch curved TV (pictured) costs around £7,000 compared to around £2,000 for its flat screen equivalent .

'It’s an interesting idea, but its solving a problem that doesn’t need to be solved,’ said Stuart Miles of gadget site Pocket Lint. ‘As a piece of technology it’s mind boggling. ‘However, I’m yet to see the benefit of a curved TV - it still seems like a little bit of showboating.’ Others claim the effect is ruined if you aren’t sitting in the right spot. ‘Curved TVs work well if you're sat in the sweetspot for watching TV, making for a more immersive experience, but if you're off-axis then you lose the benefit of the curve - not ideal for family viewing,’ said Joe Cox of What Hi. ‘So it might be better suited to smaller devices, used by one person at a time - tablets or phones, for instance.’ The sets shown are expected to be extremely expensive compared to normal flat TVs.

From Heidi Montag’s breast reduction to Cameron Diaz's Botox admission, it seems cosmetic surgery was big business in 2013. And vain Brits are following their favourite celebrities' leads, with 2014 set to see a huge surge in treatments - some of which you've probably never even heard of. A new survey has . analysed the most popular treatments of the last year: arm lifts, buttocks lifts and even 'buffalo hump' surgery dominated the cosmetic world. Heidi Montag and Cameron Diaz have admitted to plastic surgery and it seems to be getting more and more popular, if knew research is anything to go by . Buffalo hump removal, in which there was negligible interest in . 2012, saw a 350 per cent increase in 2013, found researchers. This surgery removes the fatty . build-up at the base of the neck caused by excessive weight gain. Although it’s still not widely available in the UK, demand amongst . British patients is certainly on the up, according to research. A spokesperson for WhatClinic.com, who carried out the research, said: 'Buffalo humps can be an unusual side effect of certain medications, but more often they appear over time, through obesity.  Poor posture doesn't help either, making it more noticeable. Buffalo hump surgery removes the fatty build-up at the base of the neck caused by excessive weight gain . 'This issue undoubtedly leaves sufferers feeling self-conscious and miserable, especially as it occurs in an area of the body that people don't usually worry about. A relatively simple surgical procedure can correct the problem, and restore the person's normal shape.' Arm lifts saw a staggering 473 per cent increase in 2013, as many patients waved goodbye to those dreaded bingo wings. Mini-facelifts dropped by 60 per cent as less invasive treatments, such as dermal fillers proved more popular with patients . Fluctuations in weight and growing older can cause the upper arm skin to sag, which is what the surgery - also known as brachioplasty - corrects. The cost, however, is not for the light of pocket, averaging £3,872 - over a third (35 per cent) more than it cost in 2012. With Beyonce’s booty once again taking centre stage in her raunchy new video, Partition, it's not surprising that enquiries into buttock lifts more than tripled (221 per cent) last year. However, the surgery, which aims to contour and sculpt patients' rears, comes with a hefty price tag of around £4,226 and experts recommend no physical exertion for three to six weeks following treatment. It wasn't just women going under the knife in 2013, as male breast reduction enquiries more than doubled last year. However, over a third (35 per cent) of those looking to banish their 'moobs', went overseas to countries such as Poland, the Czech Republic and Belgium, where surgeries are considerably cheaper. Full abdominoplasty, also known as a tummy tuck, saw enquiries fall by half (46 per cent) last year, while abdominal etching dropped by almost a fifth (17 per cent). Etching, hugely popular in the 1990s, is aimed at people who are quite fit but have a small amount of fat covering their abs. Demand for both procedures is now falling as many patients opt for alternatives like fat transfer, which saw a 126 per cent increase in the past 12 months. Mini-facelifts also dropped by 60 per cent as less invasive treatments, such as non-surgical facelifts and dermal fillers (both up 93 per cent) and Thermage skin tightening (up 80 per cent) proved more popular with patients.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement says it has arrested 255 alleged child predators, including a 49-year-old middle school teacher, and identified 61 underage victims in an international sting operation. The five-week operation, which ended June 30, targeted sexual predators who use the Internet to exploit children and disseminate child pornography. Twenty people were charged with online sexual enticement of a minor, which investigators are calling 'sextorting.' The crime involves coercing children into producing nude or sexual photos by threatening them with blackmail or violence. Scroll down for video .

The remaining suspects were charged with child pornography production, possession or distribution of child pornography, traveling with the intent to have sex with a minor and other offenses including rape. More than one third of the victims identified during the sting operation were engaging online with strangers who sexually exploited them. The ages of those victims ranged from seven to 17 years old and the majority were between 13 and 15 years old. Overall, 20 of the victims are under the age of nine, including seven who are younger than six years old.

The C-Max Solar Energi claims to be the first sun-powered hybrid vehicle that does not depend on electricity for fuel. The vehicle, which has one-and-a-half square metres of photovoltaic cells on its roof, will go on show at the Consumer Electronics Show 2014 (CES) held in Las Vegas this week. Scroll down for video . The C-Max Solar Energi, concept image pictured, is set to be the first sun-powered hybrid vehicle that does not depend on the electric grid for fuel. Ford claims the car can cut greenhouse gas emissions per car by four tonnes a year . The panels, built by SunPower in California, have a single metal layer on the back of the photovoltaic cells. This layer is fitted inside curved glass on the top of the car, which the company claims enables them to use 50 per cent more energy over the same surface area than standard solar panels. However, these panels alone do not generate enough energy to power a car for a day. Instead, Ford plans on amplifying the amount of solar energy harvested using a solar concentrator lens called a Fresnel lens, similar to that of a magnifying glass. Fresnel lenses were originally made of glass and were used in lighthouses to extend the reach of light over the water. They are now made from lightweight acrylic. The car is designed to be parked under a canopy equipped with a Fresnel lens to boost the impact of the sunlight by a factor of eight. Ford said the car could move back and forward independently when 'parked' to track the sun and keep the maximum amount of solar energy concentrated on its panels . Scientists from the Georgia Institute of Technology came up with the idea that the car could be parked under a canopy fitted with Fresnel lens, in an open-ended garage for example. Ford added the car could then move independently back and forward underneath this canopy to track the sun and keep the maximum amount of solar energy concentrated on its panels. This would then  boost the impact of the sunlight 'by a factor of eight' to charge the vehicle more effectively. By using a combination of the efficient solar panels and the lens canopy, the company believes the car can gain the equivalent of a four-hour plug-in charge (about 8 kilowatts) in one day. The panels on the car's roof, pictured, are housed in curved glass on the top of the car. The manufacturer of the cells, SunPower, claims this shape enables the panels to collect 50 per cent more energy over the same surface area than standard solar panels . This translates as enough energy for most people to make local journeys without using the car’s gas system or plugging the car into an electricity grid. The car additionally comes with a conventional hybrid system for when the sun isn’t shining. Using a combination of its hybrid systems and solar panels, the C-Max Solar Energi has a range of 621 miles, including 21 miles of driving using electricity only.

The unnamed 55-year-old went to his doctor after the vision in that eye began to deteriorate over the next six months, according to a report in the New England Journal of Medicine. The patient said he'd been punched nine months earlier, the doctors from the Innsbruck Medical University, Innsbruck, wrote in their report. 'Nature has made a beautiful cataract': Doctors in Austria reported the case of a 55-year-old man who'd been punched in the eye nine months earlier . Cataracts are where the lenses in the eye become clouded, causing blurred . vision. It's most common for them to form with old age - an estimated one in three people over 65 have them - but they can also be caused by injury to the eye.

Symptoms include problems seeing in dim light, while bright lights may appear more . glaring. Colours may appear different and there may be a yellow tinge . to vision.

In this case, 'nature has made a beautiful cataract,' he said. 'Most aren't so pretty.' After being punched, balls used in sport are the most common cause - but injuries from airbags and steering wheels have also caused cataracts, he added. He said if the eyeball receives trauma, such as a punch, the energy . of the blow sends shock waves through the eye. This can damage the eye's lens, triggering the formation of a cataract. Cataracts typically make the eye look cloudy and are white or yellow in appearance. The man is reported to have had the cataract broken up by a procedure called 'phacoemulsification' - where sound waves break up the opaque part of the lens and it is removed with a vacuum.","55-year-old Austrian man had been punched in the eye nine months before .

They say a woman's work is never done - and she's not likely to get much help from her husband either, according to a new study. Researchers have found that more than half of men would not be prepared to swap roles with their wives or girlfriends, with many put off by the thought of running the home, juggling childcare with work and planning weekly meals. Men also confessed that they would would dread having to undertake the weekly food shop, getting children ready for school, cleaning, and managing household bills. Gender divide: Researchers have found that more than half of men would not be prepared to swap roles with their wives or girlfriends . And one in three of the men polled by Co-operative Food admitted they had the easy option in life, with 43 per cent claiming they have 'no idea' how their partner is able to multi-task so efficiently. 'Men seem very reluctant to swap roles with their partners,' said Janet Taylor, Diet and Health Manager for Co-operative Food. 'Even though, in many households, . women also have full-time jobs, it seems that lots of other chores, . including housework, running around after the kids and making sure . everyone is organised, often falls to the female. Off-putting: Many men polled said they would be deterred from swapping lives with their wives of girlfriends because of duties such as childcare and cleaning . 'Despite . our differences, men and women are generally happy with their roles - . and, as we all know, the key to running an efficient and healthy . household is always teamwork.' The survey was commissioned to celebrate the supermarket's support for the government's Change4Life Smart Swaps campaign, which encourages families to consider switching unhealthy treats for alternatives that are lower in fat and sugar. Participants were also quizzed on which celebrities they would like to switch lives with, with most men saying they would like to have David Beckham's life, and women wanting to be like presenter Holly Willoughby. Other top picks included music mogul Simon Cowell, and racing driver Jenson Button for men, while women would also like to experience the lifestyles of Victoria Beckham and the Duchess of Cambridge. 'It . was interesting to see that women would swap places with busy working . mother Holly Willoughby, whilst men would switch with multi-talented David . Beckham, who manages to combine worldwide fame with family commitments,' said Ms Taylor. The study of 1,000 men and 1,000 . women showed that 56 per cent of men believe they would find it hard if . they had to juggle work with childcare every day. Just . under half of the men polled were more than happy to let their partner . cook every night, and 46 per cent liked their wives or girlfriends to be . responsible for the weekly food shop. In . four in 10 households, women are solely responsible for the running of . the house - and clean, pack lunch boxes, book appointments, take the . children to clubs and get up in the night if the kids wake. Swiitch: Women would like to swap lives with working mother Holly Willoughby, according to the poll, while men would like to switch with David Beckham, who combines fame with family commitments . A . further seven in 10 men would also dislike having to impress friends . and family with their hosting skills and ability to run a beautiful . house with perfect children. Interestingly, despite their busy lifestyles, only 27 per cent of women would change their lives and swap with their other half. More . than half of women claim that although their partners have less to . juggle on a daily basis, they are quite happy with their lot. And . two thirds of women acknowledged the fact they probably couldn't do . their partner's job, with six in 10 claiming his job was far more . stressful than their average day at home. A further one third of women also said their other half would be utterly useless in their role. When asked what they'd most like to swap about their lives, 40 per cent of women said would like to swap their body for a leaner one, while 28 per cent said they would change where they live. Men said they would like to swap their UK home for one abroad (29 per cent), and 23 per cent wished for a change of career. Ms Taylor added: 'We are encouraging our customers to join us in supporting the Change4Life Smart Swaps initiative with great deals on a wide variety of healthier products. 'Recommended swaps include swapping sugary drinks for diet or sugar-free versions, water or lower fat milk; swapping cheese to reduced fat cheese, swapping butter for lower fat butter or spreads; swapping sugary cereals to plain porridge, whole wheat cereal biscuits or plain shredded whole grain, and swapping whole milk to semi-skimmed.' 1.

Amazing recovery: Chris Smith, who wore glasses for 20 years now has 20:20 vision after surgery to remove a golf ball-sized tumour from his brain, allowing him more time with wife Samantha and baby Freddie, born in November 2012 . A policeman who wore glasses for 20 years now has 20:20 vision after surgery to remove a golf ball-sized tumour from his brain. Chris Smith, 35, had worn glasses since the age of 12, but is now able to see perfectly. The father-of-one had only just returned from honeymoon with his wife Samantha in 2011 when he began suffering headaches. ‘We . had been to Jamaica and I had put them down to too many cocktails,’ said Mr Smith, from Catterall near . Preston, Lancashire. ‘I was getting dizzy . and bad-tempered but I thought I was just having a bad few weeks after . lying on a beach for a fortnight,' he said. But when he fell down the stairs at work, he realised something was seriously wrong. A CT scan uncovered a tumour in his brain which it is believed he had had for more than two decades. Doctors were forced to perform an immediate craniotomy to cut open Mr Smith’s skull and remove the non-cancerous tumour, which was pushing down on his brain. When he woke up after the operation, he suddenly realised he could see. He said: ‘It was amazing. I was . sitting in the hospital without my glasses on and all of a sudden I . realised I could see without them on. ‘I . went for a walk around and tried to look at things I couldn't see . without them before, and everything was clear. It was amazing. ‘I . went to see an optician who confirmed I didn't need them any longer. My . eyes are completely different to how they were before.’ Without treatment, the growth would . have put further pressure on the brain, and could have caused fits or . permanent brain damage. Mrs . Smith, 30, said: ‘It was a very scary time for us. We'd only just got . married and they started talking about the possibility of Chris being . left paralysed or without his memory. ‘The hospital said they could deal with it very easily, but we were terrified something would go wrong.’ Chris Smith (pictured with his wife, Samantha, and baby Freddie) has  20:20 vision after surgery to remove a golf ball-sized tumour from his brain . Symptoms: Mr Smith, pictured left recovering, began suffering headaches after his honeymoon in 2011. Doctors later diagnosed him with a benign brain tumour, pictured right . This then had to be drained regularly following his operation to make sure a build-up of fluid didn't occur. Mr Smith said: ‘My head swelled up massively. I looked like Frankenstein. ‘It was the most horrendous thing I have ever seen.’ Mr . and Mrs Smith spent Christmas and New Year in hospital while he . recovered from surgery before he was given a three-month . course of radiotherapy to blast any further cells that could have become . cancerous. During his treatment Mr Smith's wife, Samantha, discovered that she was expecting their first child . He had surgery to remove the non-cancerous tumour, after which he discovered he no longer needed to wear glasses . Double blow: Chris Smith, pictured above in hospital, was told he and his wife Samantha may not be able to have children following the radiation treatment and six-centimetre incision in his head . Surgeons had to cut out a four by six centimetre hole into Mr Smith’s head in order to remove the tumour. This, however, meant a further blow for the couple, who were told that due to the radiation exposure on Mr Smith’s pituitary gland, it was very unlikely they would be able to have children. ‘We were absolutely devastated,’ Mrs Smith said. ‘Although we hadn't really planned having children, we always knew it was something we wanted to do eventually. ‘It seemed like our whole world was falling apart in just a matter of weeks.’ But just weeks later, the couple discovered they were expecting their first child, and Mrs Smith gave birth to Freddie in November 2012. ‘We were over the moon,’ said Samantha. ‘It was the most amazing end to the worst year of our lives especially as we had been told it was unlikely we would be able to have children. ‘Chris was back to normal so it was the icing on the cake.’ Full of energy: Chris Smith is fitter and faster than ever before now that the golf ball-sized growth, which was pushing down on his brain, has been dislodged . Fitter than ever: Chris Smith says he feels better than ever before following the operation last year . Mr Smith says he is also fitter and healthier than ever before having had the growth, which was pushing down on his brain, removed. The father-of-one, who had his . life-saving operation in December 2011, said: ‘I have got more energy . than I had even as a 20-year-old. ‘I was always at the top of my game - I was able to run marathons and keep up with criminals. ‘But, after having the tumour removed, I can run faster, jump higher and my strength and energy levels have massively improved. His wife Samantha added: ‘He's like a new man now. He's just got bags of energy. I had always known him to be so bubbly and . jubilant that when he started becoming grumpy and tired, I knew he . wasn't himself.’ Mr Smith is now training for the London Marathon on April 21. He will be raising money for the research team of Consultant Marcia Elizabeth Donaldson-Hugh at Royal Preston Hospital Neurology Ward where he was treated. ‘I couldn't have asked for a better consultant,’ said Chris. ‘She was calm and confident the whole way through my treatment, and we are so grateful to her for saving my life.’ To sponsor Mr Smith visit www.gofundme.com/29xte8 . Brain tumours can affect the optic nerve itself or the cranial nerves that control eye movement. Tumours in different parts of the brain affect different nerves and often affect several nerves at once. Which nerves they affect determine what the symptoms will be. Tumours in the pituitary gland - the pea-sized gland at the base of the skull which secretes hormones - can cause the loss of lateral vision in both eyes and can cause blindness if left untreated. There are four lobes in the brain and a lesion in the temporal lobe - the part of the brain responsible for speech, movement, personality, behaviour, reasoning and judgement - can cause loss of vision in one quarter of the visual field. Tumours in the occipital lobe - the part of the brain that processes vision - can cause the area of the brain responsible for interpretation of visual signals to malfunction, resulting in blindness.","Father-of-one Chris Smith, 35, had worn glasses since the age of 12 .

In the Books of Chronices, for instance, the veil of Solomon's Temple is made of blue. However, the biblical dye was lost in antiquity. Since then, thousands of fabrics dating to the Roman period have been discovered in the Judean Desert, but up until now only two have been found with dyes extracted from the murex snail. As well as the blue cloth, Dr Sukenik found two purple fabrics that might have been used as clothing in the Roman period . The discovery was made in the Wadi Murabba'at caves located south of Qumran . Researchers and rabbis have long searched for the enigmatic colour, called tekhelet (pronounced t-CHELL-et). Teklelet, meaning 'turquoise' or 'blue' in Hebrew, was used in the clothing of the High Priest. However, the dye was lost in antiquity. One of the mysteries that scholars have puzzled over for centuries is the exact shade of blue represented by tekhelet. Traditional interpretations have characterised tekhelet as a pure blue, symbolic of the heavens. The discovery of an ancient fabric displays one of the few remnants of the ancient colour ever found. The cloth was dyed using a snail known as the Murex trunculus. Its gland secretes a yellow fluid that, when exposed to sunlight, turns purple-blue. As well as the blue cloth, Dr Sukenik found two purple fabrics that might have been used as clothing in the Roman period. The discovery was made in the Wadi Murabba‘at caves located south of Qumran, in the West Bank, and involved the analysis of the dye in 180 textiles. Researchers believe the fabrics may have . been part of the property belonging to Jewish refugees from the time of . the Bar-Kokhba revolt against the Roman Empire of 132-135 AD. Tests on the structure of the cloths revealed that the two purple textiles may have been imported, while the blue cloth was created in the same fashion as the local fabrics. Of all of the dyes that were in use, purple was considered the most prestigious colour of the Hellenistic-Roman period. There were times when the masses were forbidden from dressing in purple clothing, which was reserved for only the emperor and his family. These measures only served to increase the popularity of that colour, the price of which soared to equal that of gold.

An inquest heard how Mr Breeze, 36, of Horwich, Bolton,  set himself on fire after getting into debt with payday loan firms . A debt-ridden father doused himself in . petrol and turned himself into a human fireball after being harassed . for money by payday loan firms. Antony Breeze, 36, died after setting himself alight, telling passers-by who tried to extinguish the flames: ‘I’ve had enough.’ In the hours before the tragedy Mr . Breeze, who owed around £1,600, was bombarded with text messages about . his arrears, an inquest heard. The next day he went out, telling his . girlfriend he was getting petrol for a lawnmower. Minutes later he was . found screaming and in flames on a pathway. He had been so worried about the debts that he lost a stone in weight in just two weeks, relatives said. Mr Breeze and his partner of nine years, Amanda Lowe, had a six-year-old daughter, Amy, and were planning to marry. Police investigating his death found . he owed money to several lenders, including Keyes Whitlock and Co, . Mobile Money Ltd, 247 Moneybox.com, Cash Genie and Valour Loans. Miss Lowe said that the night before . he died on August 3 last year he had received a stream of calls and . texts from loan firms, although he refused to tell her which ones were . pestering him. She added: ‘He had calls all night on . Thursday, his phone never stopped ringing, he wouldn’t tell me who it . was. 'He went into the bathroom.’ The next day Mr Breeze played with Amy before going to withdraw £30 from a cash machine. He then went out again, telling Miss Lowe he was getting fuel for her father’s mower. While he was gone she called him to . ask when he would be home. She added: ‘He said he was going for a walk . to clear his head. I didn’t ask what was wrong.’ Mr Breeze bought £3 of petrol in a can . from a Texaco garage before walking to a secluded track.

Gooch Street, in Horwich, near Bolton, where he 36-year-old set himself on fire after getting into debt with payday loan firms . The death of Antony Breeze comes at a time of intense criticism of the payday loans industry. Last week two payday lenders were ordered to surrender their trading licences after a crackdown by the Office of Fair Trading. The . OFT said that it is also currently investigating three more payday . loans firms for bad business practices and they too could be shut down. The OFT could not name them for legal reasons. The . Payday Loan Company Limited – which operates under a number of names . including Cashnet and Paydayloans.co.uk - and Anfield Cheque Cashing . Centre have both given up their consumer credit licences and will no . longer be able to trade. Last month the consumer body sent letters to 50 leading payday lenders asking them to take . immediate action to overhaul their businesses. The . OFT accused firms of failing to conduct adequate assessments to see if . applicants can afford loans, failing to explain how payments will be . collected, aggressive debt collection techniques and not treating . borrowers with sensitivity and patience. The Citizens Advice Bureau has also . accused lenders of pushing people into debt by failing to check that . borrowers can afford to repay loan. In . a survey of 1,270 payday loan borrowers, with loans from 87 payday . lenders, 65 per cent of people did not get asked about their financial . situation when taking it out, according to research by the CAB. Mr Tunnah, who was seriously burned trying to save Mr Breeze, said: ‘I took my top off to try put out the flames. ‘He was conscious throughout, from when I first saw him to leaving in the ambulance. ‘I asked him what had happened and he . said, “I’ve had enough. I’m in debt and poured petrol over myself”. 'He . did say he wanted to see his daughter, but I said it would be cruel – at . this stage he was unrecognisable.’ Mr Breeze was taken to hospital but died hours later from 73 per cent burns. The inquest in Bolton heard that loan firms then wrote to his father asking for his debts to be repaid. Miss Lowe, from Horwich, told the . hearing the couple had argued during the week before the tragedy, but . had resolved their problems. Last night his family said Mr Breeze had . also been worried that he might lose his job as a driver for an . engineering firm. His sister, Caroline Hedley, said: ‘He worked very hard. He worked six days a week.’ But she added that he would often borrow money when he struggled to make ends meet. Some debts were paid off by Miss . Lowe’s father and Mr Breeze is thought to have seen a debt counsellor. Recording an open verdict, deputy coroner Alan Walsh said: ‘He worked . hard and provided for his family. 'But he worried about the finances of . the family.’ The news comes a week after the Office . of Fair Trading told two payday lenders to surrender their trading . licences. It is also investigating three others for bad business . practices and has written to 50 payday lenders telling them to overhaul . their practices.","Antony Breeze, 36, from Bolton, died saying: 'I've had enough'

A rape victim who was abused by a sex grooming gang from the age of 13 had to endure 12 days of excruciating questions during her attackers trial, it emerged today. The girl, who was 18 when she took the witness stand, was aggressively quizzed about her sex life during the harrowing trial.

Another vulnerable victim - who was visibly upset - was asked by a . defence lawyer to read out line by line from a police statement she gave . detailing alleged sexual abuse by her stepfather. The treatment of witnesses in the trial - which took place at Stafford Crown Court in 2011 and can now only be reported - has resulted in charities and politicians calling for the better . treatment of vulnerable witnesses in child sex cases.

According to The Times, Judge Onions said at the time: 'I feel as though I've been hit over the head with a large hammer and there seems no end to it.'

But even this did not prevent even tougher questioning for another victim. The girl, who had told the court of being taken by men to have sex with their friends, was asked to read out line by line from a previous statement which she had made to police about being sexually abused by her stepfather. The allegations were made by the girl when she was 13 but were withdrawn by the girl. She said she had made up the allegations but later said she had been abused but dropped the case because she was concerned about the impact on her mother. However, this did not prevent defence barrister Mohammed Tayyab Khan from using the statement to say that her evidence to the court could not be trusted. As the girl painfully read out line by line of what her stepfather did to her, jurors looked on in anger and another defence barrister walked out of the court apparently in disgust.

The cost of a massive tornado that battered an Oklahoma City suburb could be more than $2 billion, according to a preliminary official estimate announced Wednesday. State authorities meanwhile said two infants were among the 24 people who perished in the twister. Oklahoma Insurance Department spokeswoman Calley Herth told The Associated Press that the early damage tally is based on visual assessments of the extensive disaster zone that stretches more than 17 miles and the fact that Monday's tornado was on the ground for 40 minutes. The financial cost of the tornado in Moore could be greater than the $2 billion in damage from the 2011 tornado that killed 158 people in Joplin, Herth said, adding that the Joplin twister left a smaller trail of destruction. Monday's Oklahoma tornado also left a 17-mile-long path of destruction in its wake, with thousands of flattened and heavily damaged homes. Officials on Wednesday said as many as 13,000 homes had been affected - causing up to $2 billion worth of damage. Scroll down for video . Devastation: The deadly tornado that struck the town of Moore, Oklahoma, left at least 24 people dead and hundreds of homes damaged or destroyed . Uphill battle: Officials says that many renters in Oklahoma impacted by the tornado will get no financial help since they do not have renters' insurance . Lives torn apart: Victor Gonzalez seeks shelter from the rain under a sheet of plastic as he helps a friend salvage items from a tornado-ravaged home . An aerial view of the site shows whole neighborhoods obliterated, with gouged earth littered with splintered wood and pulverized cars. Dan Ramsey, president of the Independent Insurance Agents of Oklahoma, said a damage estimate in the low billions is 'not surprising.' 'Certainly it's in the hundreds of millions,' Ramsey said. 'I suppose seeing projections from similar disasters, it could stretch to a billion' or more. The National Weather Service said the tornado was a top-of-the-scale EF5 twister with winds of at least 200 mph â€” the first EF5 tornado of 2013. With no reports of anyone still missing, the Oklahoma medical examiner's office announced that it has positively identified 23 of the 24 people who died in the tornado, and that 10 of those killed are children. All of the children have been identified, among them 4-month-old Case Futrell and 7-month-old Sydnee Vargyas. Both babies died from head injuries. The eight other children ranged in age from 4 years to 9 years. Of those, six were suffocated. The other two died from massive injuries. Medical examiner's office spokeswoman Amy Elliott said they are still trying to contact relatives of eight of the victims. Carnage: Oklahoma's Department of Emergency Management estimated that the huge tornado that cut a 17-mile-long path of destruction left about 2,400 homes damaged or destroyed . Ruins: A bathroom is all that remains standing in a tornado-destroyed home in Moore . Assessing the damage: Brian Mullins (left) and his father, Terry, survey tornado damage to the home of Brian's girlfriend, Sara Robinson (right) Authorities and residents of Moore have started to assess the damage and plot a future course for Moore, a town of about 56,000 that was also hit by a massive tornado in 1999. Mayor Glen Lewis said Wednesday he would propose an ordinance in the next couple of days to modify building codes to require that every new home in the town would have a reinforced tornado shelter. Lewis said he was confident he would get the four votes he needs on the six-member council to pass the ordinance. The measure could be in force within months. Underground safe rooms are typically built below garages and can cost around $4,000. Besides rebuilding or repairing, homeowners are likely to suffer other expenses, including a rise in home insurance premiums, Ramsey said. Salvage: A man carries a drawer and a bag filled with clothes from Rachel Hernandez' home as residents of the Heatherwood Addition, on the south side of SE 4 and Bryant in Moore returned to their homes . High cost: Renters in Oklahoma who seek to insure their homes are forced to pay extremely high premiums because the region is prone to tornadoes . Catastrophic loss: A disaster modelling company estimated the replacement value of the properties within a mile of each side of the tornado's track between $2billion and $6billion . 'Three years of hail bombardments of apocalyptic proportions and then this? It has to result in some give someplace,' he said. Residents clearing massive piles of debris were also trying to get hold of essentials like mobile phones and prescription drugs lost in the destruction. Cellular service providers set up mobile retail outlets and charging stations. At least one was offering free phone calls and loaner phones. Insurance companies have also set up emergency operation centers to take calls from people trying to get prescriptions filled and handle other health care needs. The emotional trauma of the destruction compounded the tornado's cost. Flattened: This aerial view shows an entire neighborhood destroyed by Monday's tornado . Survivors: Jon Johnson, left, looks through what is remains of his home at 14716 S. Broadway with his brother Matt Johnson after a tornado struck south Oklahoma City and Moore . With her son holding her elbow, 83-year-old Colleen Arvin walked up her driveway Tuesday to see what was left of her home of 40 years. Part of the roof was sitting in the front yard, and the siding from the front of her home for the past 40 years was gone. As her son and grandsons picked through what was left of her belongings, Arvin found some dark humor in the situation. 'Oh thank God,' she said, laughing, when a grandson brought over her keys. 'We can get in the house.' Rescue workers have been searching tirelessly for survivors and victims, despite the difficulty of navigating devastated neighborhoods because all the street signs were gone. Some rescuers used smartphones or GPS devices to guide them through areas with no recognizable landmarks. Moore Fire Chief Gary Bird said Tuesday he was confident there are no more bodies or survivors in the rubble. Every damaged home had been searched at least once, Bird said, but his goal was to conduct three searches of each building just to be certain there were no more bodies or survivors. 'I'm 98 percent sure we're good,' Bird said.","Monday tornado affected as many as 13,000 homes and 33,000 people, causing $2 billion worth of damage to properties alone .

Married father-of-two Roberts was spared prison - on the condition that he will never be able to return to the state after being deported back to Britain. Deported: Teacher Gawain Roberts, 36, originally from Swansea, is being deported from the U.S. after admitting sexual exploitation of a child . The teacher, from Swansea in South Wales, pleaded guilty to attempted sexual exploitation of a child as part of a plea bargain to get a six year suspended prison sentence. Roberts was teaching troubled high school students in an alternative education programme in Loveland, Colorado, when he groomed the schoolgirl. Prosecutor David Vandenberg told the court Roberts struck up a Facebook conversation with the girl last year, the content of which eventually became sexual. Mr Vanderberg said that after Roberts convinced the girl to send him nude photos her school grades 'improved dramatically'. He said: 'He basically offered to help her improve her grades if she would do certain things. 'The conversation goes on for a while but at some point it does turn sexual. 'She did send him six photographs. In return he sent nude photos of himself back to her. 'We were able to tell from the school's records that her grades improved dramatically.' Sexual exploitation: The married teacher was handed a six year suspended prison sentence and can never return to the state of Colorado . Banned: Roberts was teaching at a school falling under the Thompson School District (head office seen above) when he struck up an online exchange with the teenager that turned sexual . The court heard Roberts had been hired by the Thompson School District in 2006 after passing a background check. He had been teaching a small group of high school students through an alternative education programme but resigned last year when the charges were filed against him. Roberts agreed to plead guilty to attempted sexual exploitation of a child as part of a plea bargain to get six years in prison suspended. He will face a separate deportation hearing but as part of his plea deal he is not allowed to fight it. Roberts has two children with his American-born wife. The plea bargain deal allows Roberts to to return to the UK without serving any jail time. Mrs Roberts, who refused to reveal her first name, refused to accept that he exploited the girl. She said: 'A teacher leveraging his power to get nude photos of students is horrifying.""If he was truly doing what they say, why would they give him a deal that doesn't have any jail time? He is not the person they are saying he is.'","Gawain Roberts struck up conversation with 16-year-old on Facebook .

This week TV presenter Phillip Schofield was the latest to reveal he's a fan of the weight loss plan of the moment - The Fast Diet. The eating plan, and others like it such as The 5:2 diet, are taking Britain by storm and involve intermittent fasting. Mr Schofield admitted he has lost 9lb since sticking to it. Followers must only consume 500 calories (600 for men) on two fasting days a week and can then eat what they want on the other five days. Slim pickings: Experts have warned that fasting can lead to people missing out on vital nutrients . But the Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute have now warned that such denial of food can lead to people missing out on vital vitamins and minerals. They told the Irish Independent that people already deficient in iron or calcium could cause their health to deteriorate further by fasting. They also warned that people shouldn't start the diet without first getting medical advice on whether it is safe for them to do so. Bestseller: The Fast Diet promises weightloss and additional health benefits such as lower cholesterol . Finding a balance: Over-indulging on non-fasting days can negate the benefits . 'My advice would be don't do this if . you're pregnant, diabetic or on medication, and if you are planning to . do it take advice from a dietitian to make sure you don't miss out on . vital nutrients,' INDI spokeswoman Sarah Keogh told the newspaper. The craze for The Fast Diet and The 5:2 Diet follows on from the recent popularity of the diets such as Atkins and Dukan. Ms Keogh added that people should wait until long-term research has been carried out on fasting diets before jumping on the latest bandwagon. 'It's a fad, it's not the worst fad, but . there haven't been long-term studies to show if people can follow it for . a year or two years,' she said. The Fast Diet was created by medical journalist Dr Michael Mosley whose book on the subject with Mimi Spencer has become a bestseller. Celeb fans: Phillip Schofield, left, and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall have lost weight on The Fast Diet . As well as helping people lose weight, they say fasting can improve your health by lowering cholesterol and blood pressure and balancing insulin levels - making developing diabetes less likely. But Ms Keogh warned that people will only gain these benefits if they eat healthy on their non-fasting days. However, the danger is because people are starving and in denial on their fast days, they could over-eat on their non-fasting days. Nutritionist Dr Sarah Schenker, who has written a companion recipe book to The Fast Diet with Mimi Spencer, agreed this can be a downfall for people on the diet. She told the MailOnline people should not think of their non-fasting days as licence to eat unhealthy. Advocates: Mimi Spencer and Dr Michael Mosley's Fast Diet has taken the country by storm - but experts say the long-term benefits need to be ascertained .

Kate Upton has thanked former Vogue Paris editor, Carine Roitfeld for helping her make the transition from glamor to high-fashion model. The blonde bombshell, who shot to fame as a bikini-clad Sports Illustrated magazine star, told Page Six: 'She was the first editor who put me on the cover actually wearing clothing.' Indeed, after Miss Upton, 21, appeared on the front of Ms Roitfeld's magazine, CR Fashion Book in the fall of 2012 wearing a knitted V-neck sweater she went on to grace the covers of Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, Elle and Vanity Fair. Mentor: Kate Upton has thanked former Vogue editor Carine Roitfeld for helping her make the transition from glamor to high-fashion model - Ms Roitfeld was the first to cast her on a magazine cover wearing clothes . She got to show her appreciation to Ms Roitfeld, 59, on Tuesday night at the Fashion Group International's 30th annual 'Night Of Stars' awards gala held in New York. The five-foot-ten-inch Michigan native presented the famed stylist and writer with a media award. The two were later pictured smiling arm-in-arm as they posed up for photographs together. Before landing the gig with Ms Roitfeld Miss Upton thought she was destined to be snubbed by the fashion world. Dressed to impress: Miss Upton, 21, appeared on the front of Ms Roitfeld's magazine, CR Fashion Book, in the fall of 2012 wearing a knitted V-neck sweater . A casting director for Victoria's Secret famously branded her image 'too obvious' and said she would 'never use' her for the lingerie brand's famous runway show. 'She's like a Page 3 girl...like a footballer's wife, with the too-blond hair and that kind of face that anyone with enough money can go out and buy.' But luckily, Ms Roitfeld, a longtime editor of Paris Vogue and an industry trendsetter, saw her potential. When she launched her highly-anticipated fashion magazine she picked the voluptuous beauty as her cover star with the legendary Bruce Weber photographing her in black and white. Making the most of her assets: Before being recruited by Carine Roitfeld, Miss Upton was better known for her saucy magazine covers - left, on the front of Sports Illustrated and, right, gracing GQ's cover . 'I didn't want a normal model,' Ms Roitfeld told The Daily Beast at the time. 'I wanted someone with a sensual body, someone who could be a mother for all these babies ... I would not say she's a controversial model, but she's not a classic model. And I like that.' The rest of the industry quickly followed suit and this September Miss Upton was officially crowned 2013's Model of the Year. Now she says she has her sights set on being an actress. Speaking about her role in the upcoming movie The Other Woman alonside Cameron Diaz and Leslie Mann, the model said she definitely sees herself doing more films. 'I'm not really sure what I want my next role to be, but I just really want to feel confident and feel like it's a good choice for me because I'm such a new actress,' she told UPI.","Carine Roitfeld, the former editor of French Vogue, placed her on the front of her high-anticipated magazine, CR Fashion Book, in the fall of 2012 wearing a knitted V-neck sweater ."

Television producers must be scrying into crystal balls, or getting bulletins from next week via Tardis telegrams, because the TV  schedules have been uncannily prescient lately. First there was a major drama about the Great Train Robbery that began screening on the day that Ronnie Biggs died. Then Nigella Lawson’s new food show was boosted by the most notorious trial for years. And last night, as Britain was mopping up after appalling storms, Midsomer St Claire was threatened by floods and the villagers were taking sanctuary in the parish church. The river was bursting its banks and, this being Midsomer, it was raining bodies. Psychopathic version of the Archers: Neil Dudgeon, right, as DCI John Barnaby in the country cop drama . Midsomer Murders (ITV) is a  psychopathic version of The Archers. It’s a world of bicycling maiden aunts and farmers with twine knotted round their trouser legs, bucolic and quaint and steeped in blood. Because the show is timeless, it seemed odd to have it topical. Villagers were filling sandbags and panic-buying tins of beans in the  village shop; as the downpour intensified, they scurried to the church for life-preserving mugs of chicken soup, and hymns led by a retired vicar. He was a serial killer, of course, but he preached a lively sermon and joined the congregation in a rousing chorus of Abide With Me. Mass murderer or not, the old-fashioned C of E clergyman is always a reassuring figure. Michael Jayston, who long ago played George Smiley’s loyal junior in the classic spy serial Tinker  Tailor, was the vengeful vicar. His successor was Rebecca Front, who has a grand repertoire of heavy stares and sour scowls; she is the Chief Superintendant in Lewis, of course, but she ought to be starring in her own crime series. Front can inject an overdose of saccharine into the nastiest lines, which masks the aggression in her characters. Surveying a medieval fresco in the crypt of her church, she remarked: ‘Isn’t it beautiful? All that misery and suffering, almost makes me tingle.’ That sweetly voiced cruelty would make her formidable in the police interview room. As a female Morse, she could be terrific. Neil Dudgeon has been Midsomer’s chief detective since 2010; he might want to investigate just where the series is set. The locals come from all over the place — the shopkeeper’s son and the ex-vicar’s daughter had strong hints of the Peak  District in their accents, but the farmer’s drunken son who lived  only a mile away sounded more Devonian than a Dartmoor pony. House Of Cards, the political drama starring Kevin Spacey as a satanic U.S. senator, returns next month for a second series, but again it will be available only via streaming internet service Netflix. ‘Democracy is so over-rated,’ purrs Spacey. It’s wonderful viewing, but is it television? Even more West Country, the men of the Polperro Fisherman’s Choir were chanting the shipping forecast like a liturgy in their rich Cornish voices, on another timely programme about the weather, Hurricanes And Heatwaves (BBC4). This documentary, part of the excellent Timeshift series, charted the evolution of the weather  forecast, from its invention by  Victorian scientist Robert Fitzroy — who got it wrong so often that he eventually felt compelled to kill himself, by way of apology. The BBC introduced forecasts in the mid-Fifties, after a bout of extreme weather left 34 dead in the Devon village of Lynmouth. Amid the debris, one resident calmly described to the cameras with an almost poetic clarity how he had seen floodwater wash away houses that ‘folded like a pack of cards’ and ‘the agonising screams of some of the local inhabitants, whom I knew very well’. The first TV forecaster was  castigated by the Met Office for his amiable delivery: George Cowling drew his own weather maps, and liked to advise viewers when to hang out their washing or take a brolly to work. At least he didn’t do it like Jeremy Paxman, who was required to read the forecast at the end of Newsnight, as an experiment in 2005. Paxo thought such mundanities beneath his considerable  dignity, and his voice dripped with contempt as he announced: ‘In the afternoon there will be rain, except in places where there isn’t.’ Imagine Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock, reading the poem in a Valentine’s greeting card, and you’ll have half of the sarcastic fury Paxman mustered for  tomorrow’s temperatures. Let’s hope we never hear him recite the shipping forecast.","Midsomer Murders 3/5 .

Avid fans of the Star Wars films may think they have seen every frame and heard every word from the six-part saga, but as Yoda would say: 'Wrong, they are.' A segment of the 1983 film Return Of The Jedi has been discovered, which has around 30 minutes of unreleased footage - including outtakes, alternate takes and behind-the-scenes direction. The 'lost' footage turned up on a LaserDisc, a large-format forerunner of the DVD, and contains an early take of a scene on Yoda's home planet in the Dagobah system. A long-lost disc, from a technology far far away: The LaserDisc with printed label that shows it's a LucasFilm-designed EditDroid demo of scene 50 from Return Of The Jedi . Luke Skywalker has returned to finish his Jedi training, but he finds a physically weakened Yoda, who complains about his age and ill-health. Suddenly, indignant at the thought that a young Skywalker may be mocking him because of his age, Yoda delivers the now-famous line: 'When 900 years you reach, look as good you will not.' The rough take shows how Frank Oz - Muppet Show creator and the voice of Yoda - developed the unique phrasing and vocal range of the little green Jedi master. Another minute-long clip from the LaserDisc shows Luke Skywalker's faithful droid R2D2 repairing an X-fing fighter - both machines looking decidedly out of place on the overgrown Dagobah surface. Both clips have been put up on a special Facebook page, and more footage is promised in the near future. In the 1980s, Star Wars creator George Lucas and his team at LucasFilm devised the EditDroid editing system for film and television, which used the LaserDisc technology. Instead of printing daily takes on film stock, processed negatives from the camera would be mastered onto LaserDisc, similar to burning DVDs today. It made it much easier to select takes and set up a rough edit for the negative cutter, who would then use the directions from the LaserDisc to cut the camera negative and assemble the finished film. Missing edit: A still from the unused take shows R2D2 carrying out repairs on an X-wing starfghter . Difference of scale: The 1980s LaserDisc was around the size of a vinyl LP record, and dwarfs the modern DVD . Only 24 EditDroid systems were built. The invention of less cumbersome and less glitch-prone technology saw them phased out - which is why the discovery of the Return Of The Jedi LaserDisc is so exciting for film fans. The LP-record-sized LaserDiscs were popular among video enthusiasts because they provided a better-quality product than its contemporary rivals VHS or Beta. Copy on the Facebook page, saying that the footage was never officially released, reads: 'Now here's the amazing part for you Star Wars freaks out there... Approximately 30 minutes of unedited raw, unsweetened work-print takes in letterbox format of scene 50 (Luke on Dagobah with Yoda) from Return Of The Jedi were used... Slates, people yelling action, multiple takes of the same scenes of Luke and Yoda.' Eventually the full 30 minutes will be released in snippets - and no-doubt other Star Wars aficionados the world over will be scanning their sections of the solar system in search of more LaserDiscs laden with other outtakes.","Two clips show Luke Skywalker, Yoda and R2D2 on Dagobah .

Anglea Merkel looks set to equal Margaret Thatcher's record by winning a third term in German elections tomorrow although her coalition stands almost neck-and-neck with opposition parties. A survey for broadcaster RTL last night showed the German chancellorâ€™s Christian Democratic Union and its sister Bavarian party the Christian Social Union 14 points ahead of the centre-Left Social Democrats. This means she will almost surely return for another four-year term. Anglea Merkel is on track to win a third term in German elections tomorrow although her coalition stands almost neck-and-neck with opposition parties. As campaigning entered its final stage before the election tomorrow, Merkel faced a battle to preserve her centre-right majority and avert a potentially divisive 'grand coalition' with her rivals on the left. But her combined centre-Right bloc was in a dead heat with Left-leaning opposition parties yesterday, with both camps on 45 per cent, putting her coalition in jeopardy. Mrs Merkel could win a narrow majority with the FDP, her preferred . partner, be forced into difficult negotiations with . the SPD which could last up to two months and result in big changes to . her cabinet, including the departure of Finance Minister Wolfgang . Schaeuble, a key player in the crisis. The election is being watched across Europe, with many countries hoping it will bring about a softening of the austerity-first approach Mrs Merkel has promoted since the eurozone debt crisis broke out nearly four years ago. The wild card is a new anti-euro party, the Alternative for Germany (AfD), which is given a decent chance of vaulting above the 5 percent threshold needed to win seats in parliament on election night. Earlier this week polling results indicated The Alternative for Germany (AfD) party could have entered the German parliament the Bundestag for the first time, after a survey conducted by INSA on behalf of the respected Bild newspaper showed support for the party was growing . Such an outcome would most likely force Mrs Merkel to form a left-right 'grand coalition' with the SDP, who increased their share of the vote by one per cent to 28 per cent in the latest poll. Although the SDP has publicly stated it does not want a grand coalition, experts believe it would probably enter into one if push came to shove. That would doom Mrs Merkelâ€™s hopes of continuing her current coalition and stir concerns about rising German euroscepticism, though its impact on government policy would likely be limited.","Survey showed German chancellor's Christian Democratic Union and its sister Bavarian party is ahead .

Giant cuddly teddy bears kept appearing one-by-one outside her bedroom door, ready to greet her as she rose for work. Then one morning the mystery was solved as a real-life cat burglar, Zaza, peered in through the cat flap surreptitiously carrying a soft giant doughnut. Daisy Ayliffe, 32 and her Partner Ben Wicks, 32 with their cat Zaza who has been stealing soft toys . The tortie oriental pedigree treated her owners to 17 toys in a single month . The five-year-old feline dragged its find through the flap and thoughtfully deposited it in on the kitchen floor. Nearly a month later, Miss Ayliffe, who lives with her partner Ben Wicks, both 33, in central London, had been treated to a total of 17 cuddly toys – ranging from a Roman gladiator to a Winnie the Pooh bear. While the couple could not be sure, it appeared Zaza, a tortie oriental pedigree, was stealing the toys from its neighbours’ homes. Zaza was caught in the act of cat burgling while bringing this soft doughnut in through the cat flap . While Daisy and Ben theorise that the cat is getting the toys from neighbour's gardens, they don't know for certain where they're coming from . Miss Ayliffe said: ‘I think they must have been from someone’s garden, although she could have been going into other people’s houses. ‘My sister said the neighbours would be really cross but it’s not my fault the cat is a thief.’ Zaza is a rescue pet that was given to the couple along with its sister Betty nearly a year ago. The cat, which has had the official name Nutrostar Aprilmoon, is quite a find because it is classed as Champion, having won three awards for its beauty and temperament. But when it was brought into the family home it started turning its paws to other talents. Miss Ayliffe said the first teddy the cat brought in was earlier this year and was a small Mr Strong teddy. She said: ‘It was small and I thought she obviously found that in a garden. The cat burglar was helpfully depositing her finds outside the bedroom and on the kitchen floor . While Daisy hopes the toys are coming from gardens, she cannot rule out that Zaza is going into other houses . ‘Then she brought in a second one the next day which was a Winnie the Pooh teddy.’ She said the cat has a weakness for teddy bears, adding: ‘She basically stole teddy bears and only teddy bears. ‘It obviously has some sort of fetish, the nylon, synthetic material must somehow appeal to her. ‘She used to leave them outside the bedroom door for us, it was really funny. I came home one day and there were three massive teddy bears in the house.’ But having not seen the cat in action – and with many of toys being larger than Zaza itself, Miss Ayliffe was not entirely convinced it was the cat bringing them in. She said: ‘I was on the phone to my friend who was saying maybe you have an intruder that is bringing the teddies in – the cat wouldn’t be bringing in massive teddy bears. ‘Then at the moment the cat came through the cat flap with a giant doughnut. Size doesn't seem to matter for Zaza who is happy to drag a full sized teddy bear back to her owners . Daisy and Zaza have now moved to a flat with a walled garden, putting an end to her criminal ways . ‘I thought, this is really weird. Then another day I thought she had caught a mouse as something was squeaking but then I realised it was a squeaking teddy bear and it has just gone on from there. ‘I woke up one day with an Eeyore bear in my bed. I’ve also had a hanging mobile from a baby’s pram. ‘She has brought loads of them that are bigger than her and she’s climbing along fences with these teddy bears. She must have really strong jaws.’ The 17th gift appeared as the couple were having dinner in the garden one weekend. A giant teddy bear dropped on them from the fence above their heads. Miss Ayliffe added: ‘A big brown bear fell on our table and she came to see us, we actually saw her in action. It’s sweet the way she offered them as gifts, she’s a bonkers cat.’ The couple have now moved to a flat where there is a walled garden so the cat cannot get out and steal.Miss Ayliffe said: ‘We have been able to stop her burgling. ‘Although in the first week in our new flat the little boy in the flat above lost his teddy bear as it had fallen from his window. Zaza found it within seconds. She came rushing in to our new flat with it in her mouth.’","Zaza the five-year-old tortie oriental pedigree has been stealing .

A newly revealed video shows a group of high school students callously giggling about a 16-year-old girl's rape ordeal, which was possibly happening at the same time the clip was shot. The disturbing video is the latest piece of damaging evidence in a horrific rape case in Steubenville, Ohio, in which two former high school football players have been charged. Throughout the video, which is just over 12 minutes long, there are numerous references to a 'dead girl' who is described as being raped and urinated on. Scroll down to watch video extract . Laughing boy: The 'star' of the video is Michael Nodianos, a former Steubenville student who can't contain his laughter as he describes the 'dead' victim, seemingly in another room of the house . The case has left Steubenville . divided, with some getting behind the young accuser and others rushing . to the side of the players, blasting the girl and claiming that she made up the allegations . to hurt the football program. Nate Hubbard, 27, was one of them, telling The New York Times last month: 'The rape was just an excuse, I think. What else are you going to tell your parents when you come home drunk like that and after a night like that? 'She had to make up something. Now people are trying to blow up our football program because of it.' Deadspin.com reported that the 'star' of the video is Michael Nodianos, a former Steubenville student and baseball player who cannot contain his laughter as he describes the 16-year-old victim, seemingly in another room of the house, being raped. Football town: The case has left Steubenville divided, with some getting behind the young accuser and others rushing to the side of the players, blasting the girl and claiming that she made up the allegations to hurt the football program . 'She is so raped right now,' he says at one point in the video. 'There won't be any foreplay for a dead girl,' he says. 'It ain't wet now to be honest. Trust me, I'm a doctor.' The video was obtained by hacker group KnightSec and posted on Deadspin on Wednesday. Wearing an Ohio State Buckeyes t-shirt, Nodianos jokes that the girl is 'deader than a doornail' and 'they p***** on her.' He then goes on a tirade of the figures that she's 'deader than,' including Caylee Anthony, 'O.J. Simpson's wife,' John F. Kennedy and Trayvon Martin. The city’s police chief begged for witnesses to come forward, but received little response. At least two other people who don't appear on camera interrupt Nodianos to let inform him that the situation is anything but a laughing matter. 'It is rape. They raped her,' one of them says. Charged: Ma'lik Richmond, pictured, and Trent Mays, both 16-year-old students at Ohio's Steubenville High School, each face one charge of rape and one charge of kidnapping. They allegedly attacked a 16-year-old girl at a party . Later, he chastises Nodianos, saying: 'Like, this is not like funny... what if that was your daughter?' Nodianos responds: 'But it isn't. If that was my daughter, I wouldn't care. I would just let her be dead. 'And is it really rape if you don’t . know if she wanted to or not? She might have wanted it. That might have . been her final wish.' The names Trent and Ma'lik, are also mentioned in the video - the names of the suspects in the case - Trent Mays and Ma'lik Richmond. While Nodianos may have thought he was hilarious, he's not likely laughing now, as the video is yet another piece of technological evidence seen as highly damaging to the defendants' case. Last month, social media's crucial role in bringing the woman's ordeal to the public consciousness was revealed. Two football players have been accused of raping and kidnapping a 16-year-old girl, who was allegedly drugged, dragged to several different parties, assaulted and urinated on. The kidnapping charge was later thrown out. Offensive: A number of offensive comments about the alleged rape were made online, including this one on Twitter; detectives are now trawling through the online exchanges for more evidence . Much evidence from the investigation . is focused on Twitter and Facebook accounts of those accused in August . attack, who allegedly provided a gruesome play-by-play of the crime. Trent . Mays and Ma'lik Richmond, both 16-year-old students at Steubenville . High School, each face one charge of rape and one charge of kidnapping. Mays is also accused of taking photos and a graphic video of the victim, which was posted onto YouTube. The Times reported that the trouble began with a tweet from Mays, who said on the micro-blogging site: “Huge party!!! Banger!!!!' Shocking photos of the victim passed out and being carried around by her wrists and ankles were allegedly also being circulated online. Detectives are now trawling through the online comments to search for further evidence of what happened and whether anyone else should be facing charges. Nodianos is the person behind a series of shocking tweets on the night of the incident, including 'Some people deserve to be peed on' and 'Song of the night is definitely Rape Me by Nirvana.' Fan frenzy: The Big Red plays their home games at a 10,000 seat stadium, where they are broadcast on local television . Besides appalling the small town, online conversations about the incident have left police frustrated that while people are being vocal about the attack, few have come forward to give investigators more information. In addition, the Times reported that over the course of the case, a juvenile court judge and the . Steubenville County prosecutor removed themselves from the case due to a . conflict of interest. The judge, Samuel W. Kerr, told the paper: 'It’s a very, very small community . here. Everybody knows everybody.' Detectives are investigating reports that the girl was drugged unconscious before being taken from party to party, then raped and urinated on. Allegation: Both of the boys facing charges are students at Steubenville High School and were on the school's prestigious football team . Returned home, the victim's parents found her disorientated and rushed her to a hospital. Mays and Richmond, who were detained in the Jefferson County Juvenile Detention Center before being released on house arrest, were charged with rape and kidnapping on August 24. Richmond’s father, Nathaniel Richmond, has protested both boys' innocence. He described his son as 'a good child, an outstanding student and a credit to Steubenville High School.' Mays is a quarterback on Steubenville's Big Red team and Richmond is a wide receiver. The team plays games at a 10,000 seat stadium and their games are broadcast on local television.","Group of teens seen laughing as one describes girl who was raped and urinated on .

Britain’s most profitable bank came up with the bizarre jargon to describe its latest round of redundancies which involve more than 3,000 employees. It triggered a furious reaction last night from unions which branded it ‘demeaning’. HSBC HQ in Canary Wharf, London. The bank has announced job cuts, sparking outrage and strike threats from Unite the union, which claimed staff were suffering for profits . HSBC made a profit of £13billion last year, down six per cent on 2011 . The bank said it was creating 2,017 . new positions and it was expected that the majority would be filled by . the affected staff. However, at least 1,149 staff will be left out of . work. The bulk of those affected will be . frontline staff who deal with customers, with HSBC announcing it was . ‘demising’ 942 ‘relationship managers who do not give financial advice’. Source: Oxford Dictionaries . These branch staff are the first point . of call for ‘premier customers’ who have more than £50,000 of savings . and investments with the bank. They fix appointments with financial . advisers and help customers with basic transactions or setting up a . meeting. They will be replaced by qualified financial advisers. HSBC said it was also getting rid of . up to 178 advisers for small businesses. It added: ‘This integration of . advisers means the roles of commercial advisers will be demised.’ Companies have become notorious for . using corporate jargon to put a gloss on redundancies. ‘Downsizing’ is a . favourite term deployed by firms cutting back on staff, with Barclays . finance chief Chris Lucas in February using the term ‘rightsizing’ to . describe plans to slash 3,700 jobs. Brian Robertson, the boss of HSBC’s . retail bank, also came under fire for downplaying the impact of the cuts . by telling staff he understood ‘change is always unsettling’. Unite national officer Dominic Hook branded the bank a 'disgrace' and said the bank is trying to slash pensions, holidays and sick pay as well . The retailer said it was investing £700 million in its outlets and online operations, as it also announced a 4.5% increase in total sales in 2012. Despite the new store openings, Asda said it was shifting its focus away from its 'bricks and mortar' stores towards 'multi-channel' sales including click-and-collect services. Chief executive Andy Clarke said: 'I'm . proud that in the continuing and very challenging trading environment we . were able to increase total sales by 4.5% last year. 'This shows that we are continuing to get it right for customers.' It comes a week after Tesco announced it was scrapping more than 100 major store developments as it admitted future growth would be focused more online. Unite national officer Dominic Hook . said: ‘This jargon is demeaning to HSBC staff who are at the end of . their tether with cuts to sick pay, holidays and pensions. These cuts . are about putting profits before people.’ HSBC posted profits of £13.7billion . last year and dished out pay packages worth more than £1million to 204 . staff – despite paying a £1.2billion fine to US authorities for sloppy . anti money laundering controls. The latest announcement marks another . blow for HSBC staff, who already face cuts to their holiday entitlements . and the closure of the lender’s final salary pension scheme. But high street lenders have been forced to shake up their financial advice arms following a crackdown from regulators. In a bid to stamp out mis-selling, . firms’ financial advisers have been banned from taking commission to . sell pensions and investments. Instead they have to charge fees to . customers and pass tougher exams to give advice.

It is the IMAX for the home, a super slim television with a screen that can be curved according to the dimensions of the room and where people are sitting. The flatscreen TV is already becoming tech-history as manufacturers launch curved screens that can sit in the corner and give everyone a good view. But now Samsung has gone one further with a flexible, bendable TV screen where the viewer can set the level of the curve using a remote control. Tech-history: The bendable TV screen allows the viewer to set the level of the curve using a remote control . Cinema experience: A model stands next to a display of Samsung's curved 4K UHD TVs . The South Korean company, which is the world’s largest TV manufacturer, showcased an 85inch prototype among a host of new devices at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Rival manufacturer, LG, has also announced a smaller 77in flexible TV of its own that is based on OLED (organic light-emitting diode) technology. The flexible screens will eventually join a new generation of large and expensive ultra high definition(UHD) TV sets – also known as 4K . The sets boast astonishing picture clarity, likened to looking through a window, with images that are four times sharper than current high definition TVs. The tech on the bendable set allows users to determine how curved the screens should be taking into account how many people are watching and where they are sitting. Two motors on either side of the . screen work to push them out to create and set a curve. The screens have . the added benefit of being able to be left flat against the wall when . not in use. The bendable TV . appeared at Samsung’s launch event for its new range of UHD sets, which . are led by the huge 110in version and a 105in curved option. High-quality: The 105-inch curved model at the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas . All the mainstream manufacturers, together with global TV and web broadcasters are joining forces to push the take-up of UHD sets in 2014. The industry has spent millions of pounds on the UHD technology in the hope it will not suffer the same fate as 3D televisions, which have been rejected by consumers. Samsung’s 110inch S9 TV is the world’s largest UHD Display, effectively turning the front room into a cinema. No price has yet been announced, however smaller 85inch versions currently sell for around £35,000. Display: The screens boast around 11million pixels to enhance the quality of the image . Endorsement: Hollywood director Michael Bay promoted the product during the unveiling at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center in Las Vegas . Its 105in version is the first UHD television to have a fixed curved screen and boasts some 11million pixels to provide pin sharp images. Guy Kinnell, the head of TV for Samsung Electronics in the UK said: ‘The combination of our curved design and UHD picture quality creates the ultimate immersive entertainment experience for people passionate about entertainment.’ At the moment, very few traditional TV channels are broadcasting programmes in the UHD format, however manufacturers have signed a deal with the likes of Netflix and Amazon’s Lovefilm to broadcast their output over the sets. As an alternative, Samsung will sell a UHD Video Pack - a hard drive loaded with movies that can be connected to its TV sets. Sony already sells a similar box for its UHD sets. This year’s football World Cup in Brazil will be the first major event to be broadcast in full Ultra HD to viewers in Japan, while the Rugby World Cup in England in 2015 will be the first in the UK.

Captain Robert Boscawen represented Wells and Somerton and Frome for more than 20 years after he returned from the war a decorated veteran.

The Coldstream Guard was severely wounded and left disfigured, with burns to his face and body, when an enemy shell pierced his tank in April 1945 - the last month of the war. He was evacuated to the pioneering plastic surgery unit at East Grinstead, West Sussex - known as the Guinea Pig Club - where he spent three years in and out of hospital recovering alongside Battle of Britain Spitfire pilots. But undaunted by his injuries, he periodically volunteered with the British Red Cross civilian relief teams in Hamburg, West Germany, in 1947 and 1948. He joined the Young Conservatives in the final year but it was not until 1970 that he was elected as an MP - after two failed attempts in 1964 and 1966.

He joined the Privy Council - a group of advisers to the sovereign - in 1992, the same year he retired from politics. Speaking in 2007, he said being born in 1923 and then serving in World War Two meant his life had been shaped by war. He said: 'They were world wars - total wars. We were of the age when life was enormously affected by war.' Family said Mr Boscawen - known as Bob to his friends - passed away peacefully on December 28 on the Isle of Wight. Robert Boscawen on the right in the boat wearing the black hat, taking part in Wells moat boat race . In 1944, Britain's normally cautious Field Marshall Bernard Montgomery proposed a bold gambit to bust through German lines at Arnhem, in Holland. He suggested British and American parachute formations drop miles behind enemy lines to create a path for the British armored forces. The Allied commanders hoped to cross the Rhine, outflank the German defenses protecting the Ruhr industrial region, and bring about the collapse of the Third Reich. It was a daring plan but the final river crossing at Arnhem could not be held by the outnumbered British paratroopers. The offensive failed to achieve its objective. Conservative parliamentary candidate for the Wells constituency James Heappey, paid tribute to the esteemed politician. He said: 'It is with great sadness that I learned of the death of the Bob Boscawen.

Health minister Anna Soubry said she was determined to prove the role was not a 'soft bloody girly option' Straight-talking Tory Anna Soubry risked angering her boss yesterday by suggesting she was only appointed as public health minister because it is a 'a soft bloody girly option'. David Cameron promoted her to the post in last year's reshuffle, putting her in charge of government policy on teenage pregnancy, abortion and measures to tackle smoking, obesity and alcohol abuse. But, in an interview, the self-styled 'tough old bird' said she was determined to prove the role should not just be 'given to the girl again' as the rounded on colleagues plotting against the Prime Minister. Miss Soubry took over from Anne Milton, who in turn took over from Labour's Gillian Merron. Other recent incumbents include Dawn Primarolo, Caroline Flint and Melanie Johnson. Meanwhile, the other junior health positions - dealing with issues such as social care, NHS finances and doctors' contracts - are usually given to men. At present, all the other ministers in the Department of Health are men: Jeremy Hunt, Dan Poulter and Norman Lamb. Miss Soubry, a former presenter of This Morning, made her controversial comments in Total Politics magazine. She said: 'To be quite frank, when the PM said to me, ""I want you to do public health"", I thought, ""Oh boss, I respect you so much, but I'm the only woman here and I get public health - I hope there's no connection there. 'Maybe I can make people realise that this is not a soft bloody girly option, it is a big serious job. I want my successor to be a man. 'I'm a huge fan of our Prime Minister, but I did sit there in the Cabinet room and think, ""Boss, you do know what you've just done? You've given public health to the girl again, except I'm not a girl, I'm a tough old bird"".' Prime Minister David Cameron has faced criticism for failing to promote more women into his government . David Cameron has faced criticism for his 'women's problem' - a failure to promote enough women to senior posts in his government. Labour will seize upon Miss Soubry's comments, saying it shows that the Prime Minister sees some jobs as being only suitable for women. But she insisted she was a ’big fan’ of the Prime Minister and called for an end to plotting against him. In her unique straight-talking style, Miss Soubry added: ‘When people talk about such-and-such a person as an alternative to Cameron, there is no vacancy... What we now need to do is stop people in the party engaging in quite a lot of t*******, and to accept that we've achieved a huge amount, and it's all to play for. ‘I came into politics to fight lefties... that's where political fighting goes. The Tory Party must learn from its own history that when we fight each other, you can guarantee to lose.’ It is not the first time the minister has courted controversy. Soon after taking office she said she supported the legalisation of assisted dying.

A Florida trucker found himself frozen to the ground beneath his massive rig while stopped in Indiana on Monday morning, but despite all odds has lived to tell the tale after voice command allowed him to call for help. Tim Rutledge of Orlando pulled over at a truck stop near Indianapolis after his brakes became frozen by the historic -40F wind chills. When he climbed beneath his truck to try and fix them, the vehicle shifted and pinned Rutledge to the ground for nearly eight hours. Scroll down for video . 'Nobody could hear me': Long haul trucker Tim Rutledge became pinned beneath his truck in the middle of Monday's historic wind chills and dip in temperature near Indianapolis . 'My left arm was pinned by the axle': Rutledge's brakes had frozen and he stopped at a truck stop to crawl beneath and try to fix them. That's when the massive rig shifted in the snow and pinned him to the cold pavement . 'It caught my left side and my left arm was pinned by the axle of the truck,' Rutledge said. Unable to move, Rutledge lay there helplessly as arctic winds blasted him--eventually freezing his body to the pavement. 'As I got colder and colder, I was yelling but nobody could hear me,' he told Fox59. The virtually deserted Pilot station was in the grip of the Polar Vortex and, like people in much of the nation, locals had sought shelter indoors. 'As I got colder and colder, I was yelling': Rutledge desperately cried for help but everyone was indoors at this Pilot station near Indianapolis, where wind chills Monday hit -40F . 'That's the only morning he never really called me': Rutledge had been a truck driver for years and when he didn't call his wife Lisa, she became worried and frantically dialed his number--which eventually saved his life . In the numbing cold, all Rutledge could feel was the incessant vibration of his cell phone ringing in his pocket. It was his wife and she was desperate to know where Rutledge was. 'That's the only morning he never really called me, so I just still can't believe that he didn't,' a relieved Lisa told WOFL. But Rutledge couldn't get to the phone. It feels like a miracle, then, that all those unanswered phone calls actually saved Rutledge's life. The vibrations eventually made the phone fall out of the desperate man's pocket. 'When the phone did finally come out, it came in front of me instead of behind me,' Rutledge said. Despite all the hope the phone gave him, Rutledge was far too cold to dial anyone's number. Miracle: Lisa's frantic calls were causing her husband's phone to vibrate in his pocket as he lay frozen to the ground. Eventually it tumbled out . Through biting winds and despite all odds, Rutledge was able to use the phone's voice activation function to get the phone to make a call, but he wasn't even sure who it was. It turned out to be his employers. After a day and at the verge of death, he would be saved. 'I remember saying, I said ""Whoever this is, whatever you do, don’t hang up the phone,""' Rutledge said. His boss and other employees called 911 and were able to locate Rutledge, who thinks he may have blacked out just as his location was found. 'I said, ""I just can’t hold on any longer"" and that was the last thing I remember saying,' Rutledge said. Rutledge was saved, however. And as he lay in a hospital bed very nearly well enough to go home, he sent out his thanks to everyone who helped keep him alive. 'Thank you very much to every person involved, especially the people there at the Pilot store and the EMS people that crawled under there in the freezing weather and dug me out,' Rutledge said. Saved: Rutledge was too frozen to dial a number but somehow managed to reach his employers, who helped locate and rescue him.

Mr Oka was a very experienced jumper who regularly performed complex manoeuvres and even . held his own annual skydiving competition - the Oka Cup -  a friend . said. According to friends he had accumulated 5000 jumps during his lifetime. He had even been skydiving twice before his death on Saturday. Mr Oka's girlfriend Lynn Collins tearfully spoke to KCAL-TV and said that he once told her, 'I want to do this [until] the day I die.' The two met eleven years ago and on their first date he took her skydiving. 'People should know that that guy absolutely loved the sport. He loved the diving, he loved all the people in it,' said his friend Craig Stapleton.  'We are going to miss him so much'. Mr Stapleton, a safety advisor at Parachute Center in Acampo, said his friend was fun-loving and his annual competition was a light-hearted event which had run since 1992. Mr Oka would hide chocolate eggs or beer for people to find, give out 'silly-looking' trophies as prizes and throw toy soldiers with parachutes out of planes at the Cup, he said. Oka was also fan of motorcycles and skiing . Oka landed in a backyard on Sweetwood Land after he spun out of control and was unable to open his spare parachute . He said formation dives involved jumpers holding onto the lines or fabrics of others' parachutes, but there is a risk of getting tangled and some people carry knives just in case. In a 2004 interview with the Los Angeles Times, Mr Oka described taking part in a formation jump. He said: 'You literally wrap your foot in your teammate's parachute line and you try to fly this (formation) very uniformly together.

A new photo of Fidel Castro has been released as the ailing former leader met with a Spanish reporter about current events for more than two hours last week. A photo of the discussion appeared in official media Monday after days of speculation about the former Cuban president's health, fueled when he didn't comment publicly on Nelson Mandela's death. The former South African president was a close ally, thanks to Cuba's backing of Angolan fighters who battled forces supported by the previous pro-apartheid South African government of the 1980s. Keeping up appearances: Former Cuban president Fidel Castro met with reporter Ignacio Ramonet on Friday and the two men covered a variety of topics over the span of more than two hours . The photo shows Castro, 87, seated and wearing a blue sweatsuit, looking intensely at writer Ignacio Ramonet and gesturing with his left hand. Mr Ramonet and the website Cubadebate say the photo was taken Friday. The reporter told the AP that he and Castro discussed a wide range of topics including Mandela, Venezuelan politics and climate change. 'I found him to be in excellent health and in a good mood, physically, mentally and psychologically,' Mr Ramonet said. Castro left power after 47 years after suffering serious intestinal bleeding in 2006, handing his duties to his brother Raul. Mr Ramonet has written extensively about Castro and late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who died of cancer last year. The shake seen around the world: President Obama shook Cuban president Raul Castro's hand moments after addressing the crowd at Nelson Mandela's public memorial . 'He's interested in everything. The environment, the climate crisis, Chile, Venezuela, South Africa,' Ramonet said of Castro. 'Everything interests him.' 'I found him alert, on top of current events. 'We spoke a lot about Chavez,' because Friday was the 19th anniversary of the two leaders' first meeting. 'It's clear that Castro hasn't forgotten him and maintains great affection for him,' Ramonet said. Big moment: It was later revealed that American and Cuban representatives had been in secret talks for six months leading up to the Mandela memorial . While Fidel Castro has been out of the spotlight due to his health, his brother Raul has been making enough headlines for them both as he caused a stir after shaking President Obama's hand during the public memorial ceremony for Mandela in South Africa last week. Besides the obvious optics that came with the handshake was also the revelation that representatives from the two historically antagonistic nations had already been in talks for six months. During the president's trip back from South Africa, Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes told reporters on Air Force One that 'it's been quite some time since the Presidents of the United States and Cuba were even in the same place.' But he acknowledged that 'weâ€™re in talks on issues associated with migration that, again, I think allow for there to be greater connectivity particularly among Cuban Americans and Cuba.'","Former Cuban leader, 87, had not been seen for months and surprised many by not putting out a statement following Mandela's death .

New Year's Eve revellers could be at risk because thousands of police civilian staff - including 999 call handlers - will strike today to coincide with a fresh walkout by firefighters. About 7,500 civilian police workers in London will take action for 24 hours in a row over pay while Fire Brigades Union (FBU) members in England and Wales will stop work for six hours from 6.30pm. Police officers won't be striking because they are banned from taking strike action by law. The industrial action will hit public services during one of the busiest nights of the year for the emergency services, while forecasted stormy weather could also have dire consequences for those celebrating the arrival of 2014. New Year strike: Police civilian workers, including PCSOs and 999 call handlers, will join firefighters . in a strike tonight. Police staff will strike for 24 hours while firefighters will strike for six hours from 6.30pm . Heavy rain and gale-force winds are expected to sweep across the UK today and this evening causing misery and travel chaos for New Year revellers. It will be the eighth strike by the FBU since September in a bitter dispute over pensions and the retirement age. The Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union called the London strike in protest at a below-inflation 1 per cent rise. Police community support officers, 999 call handlers, detention officers in custody suites and a range of administration and professional support staff are among those who will take action. Striking police civilian staff have set up pickets in protest. Speaking at the picket outside New Scotland Yard in central London, PCS president Richard Rooney, 44, described the issue as a 'crisis'. Emergency: 999 call handlers will also strike today, a move which could put revellers at risk. File picture . 'What we’re saying is a fair deal for all, we need a living wage. This is a living wage crisis,' he said. 'We’ve run out of negotiations at the moment. They say there’s no more money and we believe there is, and we also believe a pay freeze is totally unfair. 'Our members are the ones who are suffering and unfortunately once again those who are lowest paid pay the highest price. “Our message is not just to our employer, who we’ve had good relations with over the years, it’s actually to Government.' His colleague, Val Paris, 46, was also part of the group of around 20 protesters and said morale at the Metropolitan Police was 'very low'. 'People are just at the stage where we really are doing the job that we’ve done for years, we’re committed to Londoners, we’re committed to working for London, and we’re really just not getting any reward, no recognition of what we do. Management just seem to see police staff as nothing,' she said. The Fire Brigades Union say firefighters are 'extremely angry over the prospect of being priced out of their pensions'. File picture . A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: . 'The PCS has now informed the MPS that they intend to take strike action . on New Year's Eve - one of the days when demand for our services is . highest. 'We have tried-and-tested business continuity plans for all eventualities, including industrial action. 'These . ensure that critical functions performed by police staff are performed . by police officers who are fully trained in those roles. 'To ensure we are able to implement these plans, we stopped granting any further requests for annual leave or days off for officers and staff in a number of key areas for New Year's Eve in mid-December. 'In some cases we've also had to take the very difficult decision to cancel planned days off for officers with certain critical skills or in critical operational areas. 'These are clearly all steps we'd rather not take but we have to be prepared to maintain critical operational areas in the event of a strike action by police staff, and we are confident that we have appropriate plans in place.' A ferry crosses the Solent near Southsea sea front in Hampshire. Forecasters predict the stormy weather and heavy rains could last for a month . FBU general secretary Matt Wrack said: 'Firefighters on duty over the festive period don't have much to celebrate this year and tomorrow's strike will remind the government of the service we provide 24 hour a day, 365 days a year, every year of our careers. 'Nobody wants these strikes but firefighters remain extremely angry over the prospect of being priced out of their pensions and facing the sack owing to the Government's ludicrous pretence that men and women of 60 can meet the same fitness standards as 20-year-olds. 'The Government at Westminster has acknowledged our concerns but not done anything to seriously address them.'

Cuba celebrated the 60th anniversary of the onset of its revolution Friday, and rare photos of Fidel Castro, the country's elderly former dictator, have emerged. Castro's brother Raul - the island nation's current president and one of several Communist leaders who took part in the initial failed Communist uprising - used the occasion to discuss his plans to focus the future on younger generations that have been slow to come to power. Wearing an olive-green military uniform and a broad-brimmed hat against the sun, President Raul Castro spoke to a crowd of thousands outside a military barracks still visibly pockmarked with bullet holes from the 1953 assault that is considered the beginning of the rebellion. Castro was just 22 when he followed his older brother Fidel's lead in a seemingly suicidal attack on the Moncada barracks in the eastern city of Santiago, along with more than 100 other mostly youthful rebels opposed to strongman Fulgencio Batista. 'America's backyard': Former Cuban leader Fidel Castro (left) and Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro talk during a meeting in Havana yesterday . Anniversary: The meeting between Castro and Maduro met on the 60th anniversary of the Cuban Revolution . The years have passed, but this continues to be a revolution of young people, as we were on July 26, 1953,' Castro said. The Moncada raid was a disaster for the rebels, and many of them were tortured and killed. But it helped make Fidel Castro the focus of opposition to Batista, whom he overthrew six years later after surviving prison and exile, transforming him into a hero for revolutionaries around the globe. Yet the youthful insurgents of 1953 and 1959, many of them now in their 80s, still hold key positions of power in Cuba. While Raul Castro has led a series of economic and political reforms, young leaders are just now beginning to emerge. Earlier this year, 53-year-old Miguel Diaz-Canel was named vice president and became the first person not of the revolutionary generation to hold the No. 2 spot. 'The historic generation is giving way to the new saplings with tranquility and serene confidence, based on (their) demonstrated preparation and capacity for maintaining the revolution and socialism,' Castro said. At Friday's ceremony, a giant banner hanging from the barracks with an image of Fidel Castro raising a triumphant fist was the only sign of the retired leader. A near-fatal intestinal illness forced him from office seven years ago, and he rarely appears in public these days. Art: Maduro shows Castro a painting by former Venezuela President Hiugo chavez . Revolution: Castro (middle left) and revolutionary Che Guevara (middle right) review a military parade in 1953 . In speeches, allied leaders recalled Moncada as an act that inspired rebellion, both armed and political, across the Americas in the decades that followed. 'The history of Latin America can best be understood if we mark a before and an after the assault on the Moncada barracks,' said Ecuadorean Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino. 'Fundamentally this was a revolution of dignity, of self-esteem for Latin Americans,' said Uruguayan President Jose Mujica, who joined an armed leftist guerrilla group in his own country in the 1960s and was imprisoned for more than a decade. 'It seeded us with dreams, it filled us with (the spirit of Don) Quixote.' The July 26 holiday is sometimes used to make major announcements or address current affairs, but Castro hardly strayed from the past tense in a speech almost entirely focused on history. He did not mention a shipment of Cuban weaponry recently seized in Panama on its way to North Korea. Nor did he address the ongoing saga of National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden and his quest for asylum beyond the reach of U.S. law enforcement. And there was no new word about the future of Castro's reforms, which have seen changes such as the legalization of home and car sales, relaxed restrictions on foreign travel and limited openings for independent small businesses and cooperatives. Dictator: Seeming quite amused, Castro holds up a newspaper headlining the discovery of a plot to kill him in 1959 . Thorn in the side: Castro has been a constant problem for the U.S. since the Bay of Pigs Invasion, which he's discussing in this 1981 photo . One of the Cuban government's most outspoken critics, dissident blogger Yoani Sanchez, was unimpressed. A nation cannot be represented and led by men who have more memories than projects,' Sanchez tweeted. Castro also extolled recovery efforts after Hurricane Sandy walloped Santiago last year, and echoed common talking points such as Havana's demand that four Cuban agents sentenced to long prison terms in the United States on spy charges be returned. Meanwhile allies including Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro, Bolivia's Evo Morales and Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega heaped praise on Havana and bashed capitalism and the United States, railing against 'imperialism' and the 51-year-old U.S. embargo against Cuba. We condemn the criminal, illegal blockade perpetrated by the world's biggest power against our brother people,' Patino said. 'The backyard of the United States,' he said, 'is no longer in Latin America.'","Fidel Castro came to power in Cuba following the  1953 revolution that removed dictator Fulgencio Batista .

A father suffering from insomnia who resorted to taking a legal morphine-like drug to help him sleep died after accidentally taking an overdose, an inquest heard. Jason Nock, 41, bought the drug online after being plagued by the condition for years, the coroner was told. He accidentally took more than four times the fatal dose of the drug. His partner Lea Maninang raised the alarm in the morning when he would not wake and he was rushed to hospital where he later died. Mr Nock, who had a one-year-old daughter Jemima, had turned to the synthetic drug after years of being plagued by insomnia. Miss Maninang told the inquest that the father, from Cradley Heath, West Midlands, ordered the drug online but insisted he was not an addict. Breaking down in tears, she told the hearing: 'He ordered it from the internet and they delivered it. 'I just found out about him taking these drugs when I moved in with him (in 2012). Just lately before he died he said it helped with his sleeping. 'Sometimes he took it, sometimes he didn’t.' He was taken to Russells Hall Hospital, in Dudley, West Midlands, on August 17 last year but was pronounced dead. Dr Sixto Batitang, a consultant pathologist at the hospital, told the inquest that Mr Nock had nearly five times the fatal dose of the drug in his system. Tests revealed he had 4.46mg per litre of blood in his system and the usual fatal dose is between 0.81 and 0.99mg. Dr Batitang told Wednesday’s hearing that the drug was similar to morphine in its action and potency, adding: 'The possibility of toxicity from this drug is really very high.' Recording a verdict of accidental death, coroner Robin Balmain, sitting in Dudley, said he would ask the Home Office to consider banning the substance. Father: Jason Nock, 41, (left) died after taking four times the fatal overdose of the legal drug. He was found by his partner Lea Maninang (right) He said: 'This is tragic. It seems to me the problem with drugs that are not prescribed by a doctor and obtained through a pharmacist is that you don’t know what they are . Doctors frequently prescribe drugs to combat insomnia - but only in the smallest dosages. GPs will generally only provide drugs when the problem is very severe, and even then only for short periods. The reason is anti-insomnia drugs don't treat the cause of the problem, and a doctor may instead refer the patient to a psychologist to look at other treatments. It is very easy to become dependent on sleeping tablets, even when they are only used in the short term. Patients should always seek advice from a doctor or pharmacist. 'And perhaps more importantly, you don’t know how many to take and how regularly to take them before problems occur. 'I also propose to write to the Home Office about this case. 'I’m aware that obtaining drugs other than via prescription is very easy these days. It’s possible to obtain all sorts of substances via the internet. 'Even though it’s a big problem, I . think it’s necessary that people like me draw to the attention of the . Home Office what the problems are to see if anything can be done. 'Consideration might be given to making it illegal which it isn’t at the moment.' The coroner ruled that the death was an accident. Speaking from the couple’s home yesterday, Miss Maninang said: 'Jason was my world. What has happened as devastated us all.'

Armed police have arrested a 22-year-old man today on suspicion of conspiracy to murder Drummer Lee Rigby. Counter-terrorism officers supported by armed police swooped on an address in Highbury Grove, north London, Scotland Yard said. It comes after officers last night arrested three people on suspicion of conspiring to murder the solider. Three more men have been arrested for the death of Drummer Lee Rigby last week . Police with machine guns stormed three separate addresses in simultaneous raids across south-east London between 6pm and 6.30pm. On the Lamb Estate in Greenwich, officers in balaclavas charged in to a first-floor flat and used a Taser on one suspect. They arrested a Somali man and another unarmed man, both in their 20s. Neighbour Tariq Mahmood, 54, a . businessman, said: 'My daughter is traumatised. This is just a quiet . estate. I can't believe this happened.' Officers from the Met's Counter . Terrorism Command supported by specialist firearms officers raided a . separate fourth-floor flat 300 yards away, believed to be the home of . relatives of the Somali. The arrests came as authorities in France investigated whether the killing was linked to an attack on a French soldier who was stabbed in the neck in a busy shopping area outside Paris today. The two men suspected of murdering Drummer Rigby, 25, in Woolwich remain in hospital after being shot by police when they charged towards armed officers on Wednesday, while a 29-year-old man arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder has now been released on bail, police confirmed tonight. A great character: Father of one and soldier Rigby, of Greater Manchester, pictured relaxing on Army leave . The two men suspected of murdering Drummer Rigby, who have been identified as Michael Adebolajo, 28, and Michael Oluwatobi Adebowale, 22, remain in a stable condition in hospital, police added. Drummer Rigby was hit by a car and then attacked with weapons including a knife and a meat cleaver but the cause of his death has not been confirmed by a post-mortem examination. The young father's murder has provoked a backlash of anger across the country, with many incidents of mosques being attacked, racial abuse and comments made on social media.

Two suspects remain in hospital after police shot them at the scene . But close to the spot where he was brutally hacked to death, people showed solidarity today as they comforted one another and left floral tributes, adding to the thousands of bouquets already there. Prime Minister David Cameron has announced that the parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) is to investigate following the disclosure that Adebolajo and Adebowale were known to MI5. Police refused to comment on reports tonight that Adebowale was arrested two months ago. Two women aged 29 and 31 have both been released without charge after they were held on Thursday on suspicion of conspiracy to murder, while a number of other people not directly involved with the attack have been charged over malicious comments made on social networking sites. Searches have also been taking place at three other addresses in south London, one in east London, one in north London and one in Saxilby, Lincolnshire, the former home of Adebolajo. French president Francois Hollande said authorities were investigating any possible link between the Paris attack, which was not believed to have seriously injured the 23-year-old soldier, and that on Drummer Rigby. A Scotland Yard spokesman said he was unable to say whether police were connecting the incidents.The father of murdered schoolboy Damilola Taylor said tonight that he had acted as a mentor to Adebowale, who was known to his friends as Toby.

Asked about Wednesday's events, Richard Taylor told ITV News: 'I was terribly shocked at what I saw that day. 'It's a different Toby or Michael that I was seeing that day. I don't believe it was anything Islamic.' Mr Taylor, whose son was just ten when he was killed in the capital in 2000, said he had tried to help Adebowale after he was bullied at school and then became involved in drugs and gangs. But he said that when he spoke to Adebowale two months ago, he told him that he had changed his ways as he had become a Muslim. He went on:'Having seen how my own son was stabbed to death, made me feel that... whatever happens, they will still be alive, they will still be on the street or maybe they will take them away from the public or change their faces. They don't deserve to live.' it was Drummer Rigby's dream to join the army. Thousands of people have left tributes to him since his death last week . Meanwhile the BNP has been accused of cynically exploiting the killing to further its 'own poisonous ends' after the far right group announced it would be demonstrating in Woolwich next Saturday. And up to 2,000 people took part in a EDL march in Newcastle today, which was planned before Wednesday's attack. Earlier this month it was predicted that 500 would turn up. EDL supporters sang 'RIP Lee Rigby' as they marched through the city while a Union flag with his name on was displayed to cheers. Police said three people were arrested for allegedly making racist tweets before it had begun. Drummer Rigby's family yesterday paid tribute to the soldier they described as their 'hero'. 'Lee's dream growing up was always to join the Army, which he succeeded in doing. He was dedicated and loved his job,' they said in a statement. Drummer Rigby's wife Rebecca, mother of their two-year-old son Jack, said through tears that he was 'a devoted father'. Along with the floral tributes at the corner of John Wilson Street and Artillery Place where the attack took place, many hundreds more have been left outside the entrance to Woolwich barracks a few hundred yards away, where Drummer Rigby was based. A book of condolence has been opened at Woolwich Town Hall, where opening hours have been extended over the bank holiday weekend to allow the public to pay their respects. Professor David Maguire, vice-chancellor of the University of Greenwich, confirmed that Adebolajo had been a student there for two years but had been thrown out because his 'academic progress was unsatisfactory'. Adebowale had not studied there, he said. The professor added: 'The university takes its responsibilities very seriously in terms of preventing extremism. We are committed to ensuring that the university is a safe and secure place of study and debate within the confines of the law. We have diverse communities on campus and these include a range of different faiths. 'Given the seriousness of issues raised, the university is setting up an investigation into the association of these two individuals with the university, to assess whether there is any evidence of extremism in the university (past or present) and whether we need to update our policies and practices.'","Two men aged 24 and 28 were arrested at a residential address in London .

A former paratrooper has paid back £5 he borrowed from a friend 50 years ago - with £170 interest. David ‘Taffy’ Keegan lost touch with Victor Allin after they left the armed forces - but he never forgot the money 74-year-old Mr Allin lent him in 1964, and paid up as soon as they made contact again. And to make amends Mr Keegan, 73, of Sydney, Australia, sent his old friend - a great-grandfather of four from Kennington, Kent, a cheque for more than £170 - calculated at 7 per cent annual interest. Happy: Victor Allin and his wife Margaret with the cheque for £175  they were sent in payment of a £5 debt . It arrived in a Christmas card with . the note: ‘Please accept the enclosed £5 at 7 per cent compound interest . over 51 years in the spirit in which it is offered. Have a nice meal on . your interest.’ Mr Allin, . who also has 12 grandchildren, said: ‘It was such a nice shock. I’m . pleased Taffy has now salved his conscience, as he told me that it often . played on his mind.’ The two men met in 1958 when they both served with the 3rd Battalion of the Parachute Regiment. The . pair served in Cyprus, Germany, France and Bahrain, where their . aircraft was blown up on the runway by angry locals and their soup . poisoned by a rogue chef. They lost contact in 1964 and Mr Keegan moved to Sydney, where he has lived ever since. But they got back in touch last year. 'Have a nice meal': Mr Keegan sent the cheque for more than £170 in a Christmas card with this note . The . former comrades only made contact when the Allins decided to look Mr . Keegan up when they were on holiday in Prestatyn, North Wales, last year . - as they knew he had once lived there. Mr . Allin said: ‘We found the address for a Keegan and we went to see him. We asked if he knew David, and he told us it was his brother. ‘He . gave me quite a scare because he said we were 40 years too late. We . thought he had died! But it turned out he had moved away many years . ago.’ After inviting them . in, Mr Keegan's brother, John, immediately spoke David via Skype in . Sydney, to tell him his old friend had come to visit. Mr Allin said: ‘He came on the phone and the first words he said to me were “I still owe you a fiver”. I had no memory of it.’ Then and now: Mr Allin (left in left photo) and Mr Keegan (right in left) pictured during their time serving in the 3rd Battalion of the Parachute Regiment.

"By . Sean Poulter . PUBLISHED: . 02:47 EST, 9 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 05:50 EST, 10 January 2014 . In the cut-throat battle for  Christmas sales, Tesco, Morrisons and Marks & Spencer all announced humiliating defeats yesterday. Tesco and Morrisons have been squeezed by a shift in shopping habits as customers desert to budget rivals. In the City, shares in the two supermarkets were marked down amid warnings that profits will be below expectations. The rise of online shopping and a move away from a big weekly shop also played a part, with families choosing to buy little and often online or at convenience stores. Blow: M&S, whose Christmas ad campaign was fronted by model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, has revealed a tenth successive quarterly like-for-like sales decline, this time by 2.1 per cent in December . Marks & Spencer, like fellow high-end retailer Waitrose, did well on food – but poor sales at its struggling fashion department meant a weak overall result. Earlier this week Sainsbury’s, the third largest supermarket, admitted it had seen the toughest festive period for 30 years. For the first time in at least that long, less food and drink was bought this Christmas than the year before, industry experts say. The disappointing figures heap pressure on all three chains to turn things around in the middle of the cost of living squeeze. Tesco admitted profits will be as much as £150million less than forecast, sending its shares down 2 per cent in early trading. It is the second year in a row Britain’s  biggest supermarket has seen festive  takings fall. The 2.4 per cent decline came despite a £1billion improvement programme. Chief executive Philip Clarke said: ‘Clearly Christmas was disappointing.’ Website and convenience store sales were up, but they fell in big out-of-town stores. ‘Consumers are still feeling they don’t have as much to spend,’ Mr Clarke said. ‘People are shopping more locally, shopping online more.’ High end: Waitrose saw sales . rise by 4.1 per cent in the 12 days ending on New Year's Eve -- taking a . record £51million on December 23, when an average of 22,000 items were . sold every minute . Tesco dropped plans for 100 large Extra stores, and is carving up others and using the space for family restaurants, coffee shops, bakeries, gyms and even play areas. Phil Dorrell, of consultancy Retail Remedy, said: ‘Such  woeful Christmas numbers show Tesco is still stuck in a deep rut. ‘Its Christmas was dire. . . and the clearest indication yet that the chain’s £1billion turnaround package isn’t working.’ Arguably, Morrisons is in an even deeper hole than Tesco, with festive sales down by 5.6 per cent on a year ago, significantly more than at Tesco. The company now says full-year profits will be at the lower end of forecasts, around £783million. Its shares slumped 7.75 per cent after a trading performance described as ‘quite awful’ by Clive . Black, an analyst at Shore Capital Stockbrokers. The  company’s growth has been hampered by its relatively small number of convenience stores and its slowness to offer an online shopping service. Chief executive Dalton Philips said it is working hard to catch up and its first deliveries of online orders will go out today. By contrast, Aldi and Lidl’s efforts to win over upmarket shoppers were met with success. The stores offered higher quality food and drink, from aged fillet steaks at £5 to award-winning mince pies and fresh turkeys. Meanwhile at Marks & Spencer fashion sales fell for a tenth  consecutive quarter. Winners: Aldi and Lidl are believed to have increased combined sales by about 20% in the festive quarter . The retailer had pinned its hopes on a winter range by new style director Belinda Earl, the former boss of Debenhams. It also spent £5million on its ‘leading ladies’ ad campaign featuring women such as Dame Helen  Mirren and Tracey Emin in images by photographer Annie Leibovitz. The company blamed a vicious high street price war and an unseasonably warm October as like-for-like fashion sales fell 2.1 per cent year on year for the 13 weeks to December 28. Chief executive Marc Bolland said: ‘Anyone who was on the high street could see on the weekend of December 14 to 15, the whole market was already red [with sale signs].’ Negative clothing sales were offset by strong food sales, which were up by a total of 4.1 per cent in the three months leading up to Christmas. Overall, M&S figures were not as bad as some analysts feared, and shares rose 3.6 per cent after falling for much of December. Chancellor George Osborne said disappointing Christmas figures for some retailers were countered by positive results for John Lewis, Waitrose and Next. He said: ‘What that says to me is it’s very competitive out there in retail, and people know that. ‘There’s also a big change happening in our country with more people shopping online.’ Waitrose has a long-standing link with the Michelin-starred chef Heston Blumenthal, who has created a successful range for its stores . But how did Waitrose buck the trend? Waitrose bucked the fall seen at its mainstream rivals thanks to a reputation for quality – and a loyalty card that offers free hot drinks. The upmarket retailer has a long-standing link with the Michelin-starred chef Heston Blumenthal, who has created a successful range for its stores. This year he developed a number of festive products including gourmet chocolates, a stollen cake flavoured with Earl Grey tea and puff pastry mince pies with pine sugar. His reputation for quality and innovation has rubbed off on Waitrose, which reported that sales for the 12 days ending on New Year’s Eve were up by 4.1 per cent on the same period a year before. The perks offered by the chain’s myWaitrose loyalty card – a free cup of coffee or tea every day – have also been instrumental in bringing more people through the door. The scheme has been controversial as it means that small independent coffee shops are losing trade, while some customers have complained that the free hot drinks attract a lower class of shopper. However the chief executive, Mark Price, has been unrepentant, arguing that the immediate benefit is much better than points-based reward systems such as Tesco’s Clubcard or the Sainsbury’s Nectar card. High-end food has done well in general this Christmas, with Marks & Spencer posting strong results for its grocery department. Waitrose may also have benefited from its stores being ‘click and collect’ sites for the thriving wider John Lewis partnership.","M&S suffer tenth quarterly drop in clothes and home sales - down 2.1% .

David Cameron pledged to crack down on fixed odds betting machines, dubbed the ‘crack cocaine’ of the High street yesterday. The Prime Minister branded the machines, on which punters can lose up to £300 a minute, ‘a problem’ and called for cross party support for action when a review of the dangers reports back in the Spring. Mr Cameron intervened after Labour forced a vote in the House of Commons on plans outlined by Ed Miliband to give councils more powers to restrict the spread of the machines, which carry electronic roulette. Scroll down for video . Problem: David Cameron has acknowledged there should be action over the fixed-odds machines on which people can lose up to £300 a minute . MPs last night voted to reject Labour’s plans by a majority of 82. But the Prime Minister said Mr Miliband had a ‘reasonable point’ when he said the machines were harming families and communities but also called for councils to use existing powers more rigorously if they have a problem. As a first move, Culture Minister Helen Grant used the debate to announce that the betting industry will introduce new controls on high-stakes betting machines at the end of March. Culture Minster Helen Grant has charged the UK's five largest bookmakers to make changes . She told the Commons she has challenged the five largest UK bookmakers to implement precautionary player protection measures on the machines. ‘There’s going to be precautionary protections placed by the industry at the end of March and then we will do whatever is needed to make sure people are protected. 'I challenged them to develop a plan to link players with play in a way that allows us to better understand player behaviour and to assess the effectiveness of harm mitigation measures.’ She added: ‘I’m not prepared to delay taking action.’ According to the Gambling Commission, there are more than 33,000 of the fixed odds terminals making over £1.2 billion every year. While the Gambling Act 2005 limited the terminals to four per betting shop, Labour says bookmakers have simply opened more branches to get around the restrictions. Mr Cameron told MPs: ‘This is a problem, it does need looking at, we have a review under way. Frankly we are clearing up a situation that was put in place under the last government but I think if we work together we can probably sort it out. ‘I think you are making a reasonable point but first we’ll just deal with the facts. Councils already have powers to tackle the issues and I believe that councils should make full use of that power. I’m not arguing that is job done, there may well be more to do.’ Labour claims action could be taken before the review by putting betting shops in a separate class of building use so councils can use planning powers to restrict new premises opening. Mr Miliband disputed the Prime Minister’s claim that councils have the power to tackle the spread of the machines. He said London mayor Boris Johnson and the Conservative chairman of the Local Government Association had both called for local authorities to be given more powers. ‘One in three calls to the gambling helpline is about these machines and they are clustered in deprived areas,’ said Mr Miliband. The bookmakers appeared to give ground . last night. Neil Goulden, Chairman of the Association of British . Bookmakers, said: ‘We accept that there are concerns about gaming . machines and are always open to a constructive dialogue with politicians . about the appropriate powers for local authorities. Ed Miliband has said that one in three calls to the gambling helpline is about automated machines which are clustered in deprived areas . ‘The betting industry does not target deprived areas and is committed to doing everything it can to help society tackle problem gambling. 'That is why we are cooperating in full with the government review already underway. It is also the reason why we recently brought forward a new code of conduct for player protection and responsible gambling.’ Representatives from the gambling industry are due to meet ministers at the end of this month to detail what progress they have made in fulfilling Ms Grant’s requests. Tory MP Philip Davies, an ally of the bookmaking industry, attacked Labour for condemning pursuits enjoyed by the poor. He said: ‘This is basically middle-class people being patronising to working-class people, telling them that they know best on how they should spend their money.’ But Gareth Wallace, public affairs adviser for The Salvation Army, demanded immediate action: ‘The government already possesses sufficient evidence to take action on highly addictive gambling machines and local authorities lack adequate powers to say no to betting shops. ‘Every year in the UK people lose more than £1 billion on FOBTs; problem gamblers lose nearly £300 million a year on these machines. 'We believe these official statistics clearly demonstrate that these gambling machines are a problem which demands action.’","David Cameron has branded machines a 'problem'

For a dazzling 24 hours, beauty pageant contestant Denise Garrido felt like a queen - she had been crowned Miss Universe Canada. But just a day after receiving her crown the winner was abruptly told that her reign was over - because competition organisers had made a huge mistake in their counts. A mathematical error meant Ms Garrido was named the winner, when she was actually the third runner up. Denise Garrido's reign as Miss Universe Canada was a brief one - she was notified of the mistake 24 hours after being told she was the winner . The crown really belonged to Riza Santos, from Calgary, Alberta. Ms Garrido, a biomedical sciences graduate who has a black belt in TaeKwon-Do and a grade 8 in piano, was left devastated after officials realised the terrible mix-up. The real winner! Riza Santos was crowned Miss Canada after the mistake . Pageant director Denis Davila said: 'During the validation of the computerized scoring results (which occurs the following day), a typo was discovered in the top five entries, which significantly impacted the final results of the competition,' the Toronto Sun reported. 'This is the first instance of this type of error in the 11 years that Beauties of Canada (BOC) has produced the Miss Universe Canada pageant. 'This is an unfortunate circumstance where a human error was made, and in such a situation, as difficult as it is, it is only right to correct the error.' Mr Davila apologised to Ms Garrido, from Bradford, who dreams of a career in the medical or science field focusing on cancer. Now the title has been transferred to the real winner, Ms Santos, the Toronto Sun reported. Ms Santos had already flown back to Alberta when the mistake was realised - but has been reunited with her crown. The 26-year-old true winner studied engineering and previously served in the armed forces when she was a teenager, enrolled in the Canadian Forces Army Reserve with 15 Field Ambulance. She said on the Beauties of Canada website in the run up to the competition: 'Becoming the next Miss Universe Canada means much more than merely winning a crown. 'It . would give me the opportunity to serve my country and empower women to . achieve their dreams. Not everyone aspires to be a beauty queen, but . everyone deserves to achieve their dream. 'As . a woman who believes in a beautiful mind and spirit, I hope to . encourage more young women to become the movers and shakers in any field . of their choosing.' But despite the profuse apology, the . humiliating error could still be seen on the Beauties of Canada website, . with correct winner Riza Santos announced at the top of the page, but . the proclamation that Denise Garrido was Miss Universe Canada further . down. Created in 2002, the 'Beauties of Canada' Organization has the exclusive rights to send a Canadian representative . to the Miss Universe Pageant. The mortifying . mistake comes after a controversial row last year - when a transgender . competitor was initially banned from entering the competition.

Mortifying mistake: The Miss Universe Canada 2013 website still shows the error - which incorrectly names Denise Garrido as the winner . The Vancouver, British Columbia, native was initially denied entry to Canada's pageant because she was not a natural-born female. She had already reached the finals of the Miss Vancouver pageant before officials stepped in after it was claimed she lied on her application about her natural-born gender. The only requirement stated on the Miss Universe Canada website is that to enter, women must be a Canadian citizen and between the ages of 18 and 27. The application form made no mention of rules regarding sexual reassignment surgery. LGBT activists claimed the organisation was being discriminatory, and more than 20,000 people signed a virtual petition on Change.org demanding that she be re-instated. Donald Trump, who runs the Miss Universe Organization, subsequently overruled that decision.","Denise Garrido, 26, mistakenly crowned as Miss Universe Canada .

Bitter Labour rivals Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling have finally agreed to ‘put their differences aside’ as they join forces in the battle against Scottish independence. The Mail has learned that a private meeting between the former Prime Minister and the former Chancellor took place in recent days. Although their relationship remains strained after feuding over the true scale of the financial crisis, an uneasy ‘truce’ has been agreed in the run-up to September’s referendum. 'Better together': Bitter Labour rivals Gordon Brown, left, and Alistair Darling, right, have finally agreed to 'put their differences aside' as they join forces in the battle against Scottish independence . Campaign chiefs are now hopeful of persuading the pair to appear in public together under the ‘Better Together’ banner. In his 2011 memoirs, Mr Darling – who is the chairman of Better Together – accused Mr Brown of ‘hopeless’ leadership and ‘appalling behaviour’ during his time in Downing Street. Mr Darling, MP for Edinburgh South West, claimed that his boss was so misguided as Prime Minister that he believed the crippling economic downturn would be over in six months. The once close relationship between the pair finally ended when Mr Darling gave an interview in 2008 describing the financial outlook as the worst for 60 years. Mr Brown has shied away from public appearances following his defeat in the 2010 General Election, and his main intervention in the referendum debate to date was to launch a separate pro-Union campaign, Unite with Labour. The organisation was created to appease Labour voters and union leaders who oppose sharing a platform with the Tories under the cross-party ‘Better Together’ banner. But Mr Darling was singled out for praise by Mr Brown yesterday during the launch of the party’s campaign for this month’s Cowdenbeath by-election, in which the former Prime Minister warned that independence would lead to a ‘dog-eats-dog’ fight across the British Isles. Scotland's future: Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond presents his White Paper for Scottish independence at the Science Museum, Glasgow . 'I’m working very closely with Better Together,' Mr Brown said. 'I met people from Better Together only a few days ago, and I think Alistair is doing a great job. I think it’s very important that in addition to the Labour campaign which Johann has launched for Labour’s view of the future of Scotland, we have this all-party group leading up to the referendum. All of us will be working closely with Better Together in the next few months.' The Mail understands the pair met in Westminster at the end of last year, and have since held face-to-face talks. One source said they agreed to ‘put their differences aside’ for the sake of the Union’ and another insider said the frosty relationship has ‘thawed’. As he returns from political exile, Mr Brown will speak at a public event in Lochgelly, Fife, this Saturday to outline the case against independence. Yesterday, he appeared at the launch of the Cowdenbeath by-election campaign in the Ore Valley Business Centre in Lochgelly. Mr Brown’s Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath Westminster seat covers the Holyrood constituency, where the death of long-standing MSP Helen Eadie has triggered a by-election. The event was also attended by candidate Alex Rowley, Fife Council leader and Mr Brown’s election agent, Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont and Fife Provost Jim Leishman, the former Dunfermline football manager. In an attack on Alex Salmond’s vision of Scottish independence, Mr Brown said: 'What the SNP are forgetting is that in the last 100 years, we created in Scotland and across the United Kingdom a pooling and sharing of resources, where everyone – irrespective of their nationality – has an equal right to healthcare, an equal right to unemployment benefit, an equal right to pensions, and all the benefits of the welfare state. 'If we decide that we want to give that up then people will have to be told by the SNP what the consequences are for pensioners, for young people, for people who are unemployed, for people who are sick and disabled.' He said different minimum wage and corporation tax levels would lead to a ‘race to the bottom, a dog-eats-dog competition, divide-and-rule. And then all the benefits built up over a long period of time will be put at risk.' SNP MSP Annabelle Ewing described Mr Brown's comments as 'hypocritical nonsense'. 'His remarks entirely ignore the fact that the UK has become a much more unequal society under successive Westminster governments, Tory and Labour,' she said. 'What Gordon Brown is saying is that vital social provisions such as welfare and the minimum wage are better decided by Tories at Westminster rather than in Scotland's own parliament, a position very out of touch with opinion in the Cowdenbeath constituency.'","Mail learns of private meeting between former Prime Minister and his former Chancellor in recent days .

A gambling addict who worked for Morgan Stanley strangled his wife in a fit of rage on the day he was to attend a disciplinary meeting after losing the bank millions of pounds, a court heard. Manas Kapoor, 35, who worked as a product controller, feared he would be sacked after an accounting error cost the bank millions of pounds so asked wife Shivani to accompany him for moral support, jurors were told. But on July 10 last year prosecutors claim he killed the 35-year-old at their home in Northwood, Middlesex, then tried to cover it up by saying she fell off a stool. She died in hospital two days later. 'Fit of rage': It is claimed Manas Kapoor (left) strangled his wife, Shivani (right), in a fit of rage on the day of a meeting about his job. She had discovered her husband had blown thousands on gambling websites . In the months leading up to her death Shivani, who has a one-year-old daughter Vania with Kapoor, discovered her husband had been blowing thousands on gambling websites. He admitted he was £8,000 in debt and had been borrowing from friends and family to pay it off. Then three days before she died, she noticed jewellery including four bangles, a chain and a gold coin, as well as £1,500 cash had gone missing. When Shivani confronted her husband he denied taking it but became ‘very aggressive and defensive,’ it was said. The day before she was murdered Shivani told a friend she was considering calling the police and had thought of leaving Kapoor, but wanted to keep the family together for the sake of their daughter. Prosecutor Duncan Atkinson told Wood Green Crown Court: 'At 1.17pm on 10 July 2013, a call was made to the emergency services from their home address by the defendant. 'He said he had found his wife unconscious on the bedroom floor and thought she had fallen off a stool and hit her head and did not appear to be breathing. 'The emergency operator talked the defendant thought CPR techniques until paramedics arrived at 1.32pm. 'She was lying on the floor next to a plastic stool and the defendant surmised she had fallen from it when standing on it to get something from the wardrobe and struck her head on the cot.' In police interview Kapoor claimed his wife suffered from blackouts which could have explained the fall. But those close to the victim said the only time she had ever fainted was when she missed a meal shortly after giving birth to her daughter. When paramedics arrived they spotted a red mark across Shivani’s neck ‘like a ligature mark.’ Kapoor also had fresh scratches on his face. Further injuries were discovered on Shivani’s body during a post-mortem two days later. These included bruising on her back, elbows and shoulders, consistent with being pinned against a wall or floor, deep bruising around her nose suggesting a hand had been put over her face, and her neck had been compressed so hard it had bruised her spine. Mr Atkinson said: 'If Shivani’s death had been the result of an accidental fall, it was a remarkable coincidence that the defendant should have suffered fresh scratches to his face, consistent with Shivani, as she was being strangled, flaying out and scratching her assailant. 'Moreover, if Shivani had simply fallen from a stool, her timing was remarkable. 'By coincidence she fell on the day that the defendant was due to attend an important meeting at work to address his future at Morgan Stanley, where he had worked for five to six years, and was in difficulties both because he had been on long term sick from the previous January and because of a serious accounting error for which he was being held responsible. Mr Kapoor feared he would lose his job at Morgan Stanley but a court heard he may not have done . 'There was a real risk he was about to lose his job and this impending disaster had been causing him considerable stress and anxiety. 'By his own admission he was in debt to the sum of £8,000 as a result of his gambling and these debts had been a source of discord between himself and his wife. 'And in the days preceding her death Shivani had been complaining to friends and family about the defendant’s debts and that items of jewellery and money had been going missing. 'In short, the circumstances were ripe for the defendant to have lashed out in temper and to have compressed his wife’s neck, causing her death. Such timing, when put together with the pathological findings, point to Shivani’s death being murder.' Kapoor may not have lost his job, a court heard. In a statement Chloe Charlton, a HR manager at Morgan Stanley, said problems began with Kapoor when he failed to turn up for work one day in January 2013. She said: 'A colleague made contact with his wife who said she thought he was at work. I later heard he had been travelling around on trains in London all day and had not got off to come to the office.' After that Kapoor, who earned £45,000 a year, was put on long term sick leave and referred to occupational health due to stress. The court heard during one of his meetings with a doctor Kapoor was annoyed because he found out a junior colleague was getting paid more than him. Then in February 2013 an accounting error was spotted in his workload dating back to 2010. Miss Charlton said: 'It involved millions of dollars. There was no financial benefit to him but he had tried to cover it up.' She said she called Kapoor on the day of the meeting when he failed to arrive. 'He answered the phone and he was crying. He said his wife was not breathing. I said ""don't worry about the meeting, be with your wife."" And he said ""thank you Chloe."" The HR manager added that 'no decision had been made' as to Kapoor's future within the company at that point. Prosecutors claim Manas Kapoor killed her at their home in Northwood, Middlesex, then tried to cover it up . Wood Green Crown Court heard Kapoor wed Shivani in an arranged marriage in their native New Delhi in 2003. Jurors heard Shivani moved over first in 2005 to do a postgraduate degree in autism at Strathclyde University in Glasgow, and Kapoor followed in 2006. In late 2007 he secured a job at Morgan Stanley. A year later Shivani got a job as an occupational therapist at Northwick Park Hospital in London but Kapoor remained in Glasgow until he got a job transfer to the Morgan Stanley in Canary Wharf in 2009. Their daughter Vania was born in January 2012. But witnesses said Shivani was unhappy in her marriage and even more so when she found out Kapoor had been borrowing money from friends and family to pay off his debts. Her best friend Rajne Agarwal, who was 'like a sister to her' told the court the couple's relationship got worse after Vania was born. She said: 'She was very stressed in the relationship and she felt she had to look after the work situation, the house and the baby as well. Then when she found out about the money that was another burden.' Miss Agarwal also revealed the pair had not been sexually intimate for a while and often slept in separate beds. But on the morning of the alleged killing Kapoor claims the pair had sex. An empty condom wrapper was later discovered in their bedroom. Shivani's mother Geeta Taneja, who gave evidence via videolink from India, said a month before her daughter died she went to stay with her as she felt she was in 'dire straits.' She broke down as she said: 'I'm happy that I was there for her when she needed me but that was to be the last time I would be with her.' Kapoor called the family in tears on July 10 to tell them what had happened but claimed 'I didn't do anything,' the court was told. The following day Mrs Taneja flew to London to be at her daughter's bedside. She said: 'I was numb emotionally. My daughter was lying on her death bed and there was no hope. All I could think and pray was for a miracle to happen.' Kapoor denies murder and claims the scratches on his face came from his daughter who has long nails. The hearing continues.","Manas Kapoor, a product controller, feared he would be sacked .

When a newspaper asked readers if documentary Blackfish had altered their perception of the Orlando SeaWorld, employees of the attraction spammed the poll, with over half of the responses coming from an internet address at the park. The highly acclaimed CNN film was made after SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau was pulled underwater and killed by the park’s star attraction, the 22-feet-long orca Tilikum, in 2010. The animal was previously associated with the deaths of two other trainers. Blackfish explores theories about whether Tilikum (pictured) has been driven mad by being kept in captivity . The film explores theories that keeping killer whales in captivity actually makes the animals psychotic and a danger to humans. CNN said: ‘The film is a story about the consequences of captivity for these animals that have thrilled millions in performances, but lead a much darker existence when the show is over.’ The poll, run by the Orlando Business Journal, asked its readers: ‘Has CNN's Blackfish documentary changed your perception of SeaWorld?’ Trainer Dawn Brancheau and Tilikum before the incident in which the orca killed her . The paper then discovered that 54 per cent of the votes cast - 180 of the 328 made altogether - came from one SeaWorld internet address. When the paper put its findings to the park, a spokesman said that employees were encouraged to be vocal with their feelings. He said: ‘Our team members have strong feelings about their park and company, and we encourage them to make their opinions known. ‘Each of those votes that came from SeaWorld were cast by a team member who is passionate about who we are and what we do.’ The Orlando Business Journal revealed that the SeaWorld employees needn’t have worried, because it discovered that even with their votes removed, over 90 per cent of the respondents said that Blackfish hadn’t changed their opinion of the park.

No sooner had Twitter co-founder Biz Stone launched his latest app on Tuesday than some smart alec had used it to capture a cheeky photo of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerman texting and driving at the same time. Jelly allows users to take a photo and then ask their network of friends on Facebook and Twitter about it in much the same way as you would use a search engine. Some critics are less than impressed, calling it a ‘vanity project’, but one user Ben Schaechter was quick to put it to good use and posted his photo of the Facebook founder along with the words 'Mark Zuckerberg texting and driving. How do you respond?' Scroll down for video . Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerman was caught texting and driving in his black Volkswagen GTI on Tuesday morning . Despite a net worth of around $20 billion, Zuckerberg reportedly drives to work every day in a $40,000 black Volkswagen GTI. Jelly's free app for iPhones and Android phones allows people to tap into the collective knowledge within their Twitter and Facebook networks to find answers about things that puzzle them. The questions are accompanied with a photo taken of an object that triggered the curiosity of the app's user. Twitter and Facebook friends must also have the Jelly app to see the questions. But those friends can then forward the questions to others who might know the answer, even if they don't have the app. Twitter co-founder Biz Stone, right, launched Jelly on Tuesday, while Zuckerberg, left, reportedly drives to work every day in a $40,000 black Volkswagen GTI . Although Stone believes Jelly can grow into an ‘awesome business,’ Stone doubts he would have tackled the challenges of building another start-up unless he believed it could help teach people that computer-driven algorithms don't necessarily have all the answers in life. ‘If we are successful, then we will be introducing into the daily muscle memory of a whole lot of people this idea of, “How can I help someone today?”’ said Stone. ‘Maybe we can sort of nudge up the global empathy quotient so people start thinking about other people a little more.’ But some critics aren’t so sure, Valleywag has described it as ‘an app for the sake of apps’, a ‘software Fabergé egg’ and a ‘vanity project.’ ‘Have you ever posted on Facebook, asking if anyone knows a good barber? Or tweeted to your followers asking if ""House of Cards"" is any good? That's Jelly - a search engine that uses your friends - only more convoluted than ever before,’ wrote Valleywag’s Sam Biddle. Ben Schaechter was quick to put the Jelly app to good use and posted his photo of the Facebook founder along with the words 'Mark Zuckerberg texting and driving. How do you respond?' Stone, 39, can afford to gamble on a company with an altruistic bent after Twitter's successful public stock offering two months ago. Twitter's stock has more than doubled from its initial public offering price of $26. Just how many millions Stone has made from Twitter remains a mystery because he didn't own enough stock for his stake to be disclosed in regulatory filings. He has also persuaded former Vice President Al Gore and U2 lead singer Bono to invest, as well as Reid Hoffman, who became a billionaire as co-founder and chairman of professional networking service LinkedIn Corp. The venture capital firm Spark Capital also has invested an undisclosed amount. Eventually, Jelly's app will extend its reach into other online networks besides Twitter and Facebook, Stone said.","Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was caught texting and driving on his way to work on Tuesday morning .

Scientists believe it may have started life as a mini-Neptune before some of its atmospheric gases were blasted away by intense radiation from the parent star. 'This planet might have the same mass as Earth, but it is certainly not Earth-like,' said lead astronomer Dr David Kipping from the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics. 'It proves that there is no clear dividing line between rocky worlds like Earth and fluffier planets like water worlds or gas giants.' The findings were presented at the annual meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Washington DC. To weigh KOI-314c, the scientists used a new technique called transit timing variations (TTV), which only works when more than one planet orbits a star. The two planets tug on each other, slightly altering the time they take to cross or 'transit' the star's face. Analysing the way the planetary wobbles affect light coming from the star makes it possible to calculate their mass. The new discovery was made by chance as scientists scoured data from the Kepler space telescope looking for evidence of moons rather than planets . KOI-314c's companion world is similar to it in size but weighs four times more than the Earth. The new discovery was made by chance as scientists scoured data from the Kepler space telescope looking for evidence of moons rather than planets.

'At first we were disappointed it wasn't a moon, but then we soon realised it was an extraordinary measurement.'","Planet is covered by blanket of hydrogen and helium hundreds of miles thick .

Doctors claim to have successfully treated a child suffering with cerebral palsy with stem cells for the first time. Just weeks after being given an intravenous stem cell treatment from umbilical cord blood, the symptoms of a boy who had been left in a vegetative state after a heart attack improved considerably. Within months he could talk and move. The German doctors who carried out the treatment say the results of the treatment dispel 'long-held doubts' surrounding the effectiveness of stem cell therapy. Doctors have successfully treated paediatric cerebral palsy with umbilical cord blood for the first time,on a patient known only L.B. They say the breakthrough dispels 'long-held doubts' surrounding the effectiveness of stem cell therapy . After going into cardiac arrest in November 2008, the unnamed two-year-old boy, known only as L.B., was left paralysed with severe brain damage and in a vegetative state. Doctors warned his parents that his chances of survival were minimal. They researched the options open to them. Until now, there has been no treatment for the cause of what is known as infantile cerebral palsy. 'In their desperate situation, the . parents searched the literature for alternative therapies,' said Dr. Arne Jensen of the Campus Clinic Gynaecology, who carried out the new treatment. 'They contacted us and asked about the possibilities of using . their sonâ€™s cord blood, frozen at his birth.' Nine weeks after the brain damage, on 27 January 2009, the doctors administered the prepared blood intravenously. They studied the progress of recovery at two, five, 12, 24, 30, and 40 months after his brain injury. Usually, the chances . of survival after such a severe brain damage and more than 25 minutes . duration of resuscitation are six per cent. Before his treatment, the patient had been in a persistent vegetative state for nine weeks due to having a heart attack . Months after the severe . brain damage, the surviving children usually only exhibit minimal signs . of consciousness. 'The prognosis for the little patient was threatening if not hopeless,' the Bochum medics say. But just two months after treatment with the cord blood containing stem cells, his symptoms improved significantly. Over the following months, the child learned to speak simple sentences and to move. 'Our findings, along with those from a Korean study, dispel the long-held doubts about the effectiveness of the new therapy,', said Dr. Arne Jensen of the Campus Clinic Gynaecology. Within two months, the boy's muscle spasticity decreased significantly. He was able to see, sit, smile, and to speak simple words again. Just weeks after being given an intravenous stem cell treatment the boy's symptoms improved considerably and within months he could talk and move . Around 40 months after treatment, the child . was able to eat independently, walk with assistance, and form four-word . sentences. 'Of course, on the basis of these results, we cannot clearly . say what the cause of the recovery is,' Dr Jensen said. 'It is, however, . very difficult to explain these remarkable effects by purely symptomatic . treatment during active rehabilitation.' In animal studies, stem cells have been shown to migrate to damaged brain tissue. In a previous study with rats, researchers revealed that cord blood cells migrate to the damaged . area of the brain in large numbers within 24 hours of administration. In . March 2013, in a controlled study of 100 children, Korean . doctors reported for the first time that they had successfully treated . cerebral palsy with allogeneic cord blood. Dr Jensen and his colleague Professor Hamelmann of the Department of Paediatrics at the Catholic Hospital Bochum (University Clinic of the RUB), reported their success in journal Case Reports in Transplantation.","The child was left in a vegetative state after going into cardiac arrest .

In June it was revealed Mr Kelly likes to do target practice with exactly the same kind of gun which was used to shoot her - as she cheers him on from their porch. The couple admit they still love the ‘gun culture’ and argue that their knowledge of guns gives them more credibility with the gun lobby and the National Rifle Association. They have made themselves strident gun campaigners and Giffords’ face is now on a huge billboard in New York’s Times Square asking for tougher checks on those buying firearms. Mr Kelly bought the assault rifle in March at a gun shop in Tucson to show how easy it was to buy such a weapon. But after his motives became public the shop owner refused to hand it over and gave him a refund, claiming that it was not for ‘personal use’ so he could not sell it. At the time, Todd Rathner, a lobbyist for the National Rifle Association's affiliate in Arizona and a national NRA board member, questioned the point that Mr Kelly was trying to make. He said: ‘If you believe him, it's a cheap publicity stunt. If you don't, then he was speculating on the value of the rifle because he knew the prices would be inflated.’","Former Arizona congresswoman Gabby Giffords, 43, was shot in the head in January 2011 in Arizona .

A former college professor jailed for abducting a female student was revealed to have secretly fathered a child after swapping her believed father's sperm sample with his own at a fertility clinic where he worked. Thomas R. Lippert served two years in prison for kidnapping a student from Purdue University, Indiana in 1975 and performing 'love experiments' on her including electroshock therapy, threatening her family and locking her up in a black box over a three-week period. Lippert went on to work at the Reproductive Medical Technologies clinic in Salt Lake City, Utah from 1988 to 1993. Scroll down for video . Thomas R. Lippert served two years in prison for kidnapping a student from Purdue University, Indiana in 1975 and performing 'love experiments' on her including electo-shock therapy . His deception was only revealed after a Utah family who visited the clinic for IVF in 1982 sent cheek swabs off for online genetic testing. The results were shocking with the family discovering that their 21-year-old daughter Ashley was not related to the man she believed to be her father but instead was Lippert's child. The mother of the family tracked down a cousin of Lippert's who revealed the man's past.  A genetic test with Lippert's 99-year-old mother revealed that Ashley is his daughter. The girl's mother Paula told KUTV that she and her husband Jeff were 'shook' but she reminds herself that she loves her daughter as much as ever. According to reports, Lippert would keep a wall of portraits of children born through the clinic at his desk and seemed 'proud' of them, sparking fears he may have secretly fathered other children. Paula asked: 'All those photos of the babies that he was so proud of I thought, ''oh . my god how many of those are his biological children?''' Information as to just what happened at the sperm bank are sketchy as Lippert died in 1999 and the clinic closed in 1998. Appeals are being made for anyone who received a sperm donation at this time and may have doubts to come forward. CeCe Moore, a genetic genealogist, has set up a site Was Your Child Fathered by Thomas Lippert? as she is concerned that there may be more children fathered by Lippert in the Salt Lake City area. Lippert's widow, who did not have any children with the kidnapper said she was not surprised by the revelations, telling KUTV: 'I think, because Tom didnâ€™t have any kids, he wanted to have a lot of kids out there.' Mrs Lippert said that she tried to leave her husband but that he had threatened to kill her. Thomas Lippert worked at  Reproductive Medical Technologies clinic in Salt Lake City, Utah from 1988 to 1993 where it is believed he swapped sperm samples with his own . Lippert was found guilty of the abduction of fine-arts student Susan Wells Cochran, 21, when he was a 25-year-old law professor at Southwest State College in Marshall, Minnesota. The professor, who was a friend of Miss Cochran, tried to 'brainwash her into falling in love with him' with the help of a student assistant Harold Ross Tenneson, 21. The kidnappers drove Miss Cochran through several states after abducting her when she posted an ad for a ride to Boston to visit her boyfriend. Miss Cochran told People: 'We got 30 miles out of town. And, well, that was it.' She was forced to strip and endure electroshock therapy confined in a 'black box'. She was also forced to sleep in the same bed as Lippert but was not raped by him. The student was found three weeks later at the Southwest State Library by FBI after a lengthy search for the missing woman.

A French chef opened a new restaurant in Pakistan - only to then ban any Pakistanis from eating there. Philippe Lafforgue's restaurant specialises in traditional French cuisine with coarse-grained pork sausages, blood pudding and fine wine on his menu. Lafforgue, who moved to the country in 2005, wanted his restaurant to exclusively serve expats wanting to eat non-halal meat and to drink alcohol. But his small bistro 'La Maison' in Pakistan’s capital Islamabad was shut down by police after he banned any Pakistanis from coming in unless joined by a foreigner. Raid: Philippe Lafforgue's restaurant La Maison in Islamabad has been shut down by police after he refused to let Pakistanis dine in his restaurant unless accompanied by a foreigner . He was raided by police after Cyril Almeida, a prominent Pakistani journalist, complained his restaurant was refusing reservations from anyone except 'foreign-passport holders'. After being refused a table, Almeida turned to social media, launching a campaign with the hashtag 'NoToApartheid'. Almeida said: 'It is so obviously offensive and obnoxious... why should a private individual establish a club or an establishment which blocks out the very people of the country it is operating in?' He published the address of 'La Maison' online and then contacted the police, the ministry of the interior and the local member of parliament. Two senior police officials then tried to book a table at the restaurant, which is decorated with ornate carpets and works of art, but they too were refused a table. Lafforgue claims he only barred Pakistanis from his restaurant because the law prohibits the sale of alcohol to Muslims but not to 'non-Muslim foreigners' Officers then raided La Maison, arrested . two local staff and confiscated some 300 bottles of wine, beer and even . Perrier — possibly thinking the sparkling mineral water was champagne - . before shutting the restaurant down. Lafforgue claims he felt he had no choice but to refuse locals entry to his restaurant because serving alcohol to Muslims is illegal. Former socialist prime minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto banned alcohol in 1977, bowing to pressure from Islamic parties. But authorities allow its sale to non-Muslims, primarily for festive purposes, and 'non-Muslim foreigners'. 'All that I have done was to abide by Pakistani law. If I did something illegal, I would have been condemned by mullahs and visited by the police [earlier],' says Lafforgue, who was previously a chef in France and moved to Pakistan to work as a firework technician. In the diplomatic enclave, a high-security area of the capital which houses most foreign embassies, private restaurants and clubs sell alcohol to foreigners and their Pakistani guests. Many prominent Pakistanis were left outraged by Lafforgue's stance - calling it offensive and obnoxious . The same goes for major hotels around . the country, where foreigners pay handsomely for beer that might come . served in a teapot or coffee cup to allay suspicions. Some posh restaurants operate a 'bring your own booze' rule as long as customers are discreet. Even those who obtain licences are sometimes forced to close for days at a time by the police, who are believed to run extortion rackets. After the raid, which happened on Saturday, Lafforgue was able to retake possession of his establishment. Confident he is in the right, he awaits the release of his two employees and the return of his stock, and hopes to re-open his restaurant — this time by registering it as a 'private club'. Almeida says he doesn’t have a problem with a private club, but says nationality should not be a reason to refuse someone membership. 'Having a membership criteria does not mean you can exclude people on the basis of nationality,' he says.","Philippe Lafforgue's bistro La Maison serves French specialties and wine .

The annual collection of chunks of ice from a New Hampshire lake was able to start nearly a month earlier than previous years thanks to the recent cold snap. Crews armed with saws and picks collected the blocks on Thursday for a Holderness campsite, which uses the ice as a natural freezer. Cool idea: The giant ice cubes float in Squam lake before being hooked out . First cut: Carl Hansen uses a custom-built circular saw to cut into the frozen lake . Dig in: The saw cuts through the lake ice, which must be 12in thick for a harvest to take place . Last year the workers couldn't begin sawing the 16in by 19in blocks, each weighing about 160lb, until February 6, because of warm and wet conditions. The harvest, which has taken place for more than a century, can't begin until ice on Squam Lake in Squaw Cove is 12in thick. At that point, a team of workers descend on the lake to collect up to 200 tons of ice that will be stored in specially insulated houses that will preserve them until summer. Using a specially adapted circular saw, the lake is carved into chunks before the crew use ice picks to haul the blocks into trucks. The giant ice cubes are then driven to the campground, where they are stored in special cabins that prevent them from melting. Campers at Rockywold-Deephaven Camps will be able to use the blocks to help chill their ice boxes and keep supplies cool during their vacations later this year.

The 51-year-old has shed a dramatic amount of weight after undergoing lap-band surgery in February, following relentless taunts about his girth. But image expert Sylvie di Giusto claims Christie would be taken more seriously as a Presidential candidate if he continued to drop the pounds. Before and after: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie reportedly weighed more than 330 pounds before lap-band surgery in February (left, pictured in March 2011). He claims he is now half-way to his goal weight (right, pictured November 5) 'You will see a huge difference in his face actually and the face is always important for politicians you cannot hide anything in the face,' she told My9NJ.

In a new blow to the family of Australian nurse Noeline Bischoff and her 14-year-old daughter who suddenly died on their dream holiday, Bali police said last night that they were not going to allow the bodies to be flown home until 'criminal activity' has been ruled out. The new twist in the baffling deaths of mother and daughter from Queensland's Sunshine Coast came as the pair's family were preparing a memorial service to be held on Thursday morning in their home town of Caloundra. Ms Bischoff, 54, and her daughter died only a few hours after checking into their holiday resort, on the east coast of the holiday island, prompting reports that they had died from food poisoning or an allergy. Tragic: Yvana (left) and her mother Noelene Bischoff died after eating at a restaurant in Bali on the first night of their holiday . Drugs: Some of the items found by police including inhalers and anti-allergy medication in the hotel room in the Padang Bay Resort in Bali . Twenty nine medicines were found in . their room at the Padang Bai Beach Resort, leading to further . speculation that if a combination of any of the medicines had been . taken, this could also have resulted in death. Their . family had asked for the bodies to be returned so a post mortem . examination could be carried out in Australia - but last night police in . Bali said that request would not be immediately adhered to. 'We . have received a formal request to release the bodies to the family,' said Mr Adnan Pagibu, the chief detective of Karangasem Police, whose . authority covers the area where mother and daughter were staying. But he added: 'We have not ruled out criminal activity and we will not yet allow the release of the bodies from the morgue.' The . bodies of Ms Bischoff and her daughter, who ate a fish lunch and more . fish at dinner, are behing kept at the Sanglah Hospital, where a doctor . said that early indications were that poisoniong from food or . intoxication from drugs were the most likely causes of death.

'It . is too early to tell without an autopsy,' said the doctor, adding that . the hospital could not allow the bodies to be released or returned to . the family in Australia until police provided a written request from the . family. It is understood a request has already been passed to Bali police, who have delayed the bodies' return. A . doctor in the northern Australian city of Darwin warned last night that . delays in carrying out a post mortem examination could mean the cause . of death will never be known. Dr . Malcom Johson-Leak of the National Critical Care and Trauma Response . Centre in Darwin, said bringing the bodies home to Queensland for an . autopsy could make it more difficult to determine the cause of death. 'The . longer the time before the actual autopsy is done and samples taken, . the less likely you are to pick up low levels of various toxic agents,' the doctor told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's radio. Police . investigating the sudden deaths of Ms Bischoff, a nurse, and her daughter found 30 different drugs in the hotel room they were staying in. The medications were . discovered in a toiletries bag and included asthma inhalers, . over-the-counter pills such as Nurofen and Imodium and vitamins. Officers . also recovered Camidryl, a strong anti-allergy drug made in Indonesia . and Kalmethasone, a medicine administered by injection and used to treat . severe asthma. A pack of needles – one of which appeared to have been used – was also in the room at the Padang Bay Resort, in East Bali. The pair fell seriously ill hours after dining at The Buddha Bar and Restaurant on Friday night. The 54-year-old, from Queensland, died while being taken by ambulance to Bali International Medical Clinic in Denpasar. Her daughter passed away at the clinic without knowing her mother was dead. Their family had wanted their bodies to be returned to Australia for post mortem examinations to be carried out. Relatives believe that both died as a result of fish poisoning, a claim which the Buddha Bar’s management has vehemently denied. It is understood that at 1.15am on Saturday the daughter begged for help from hotel security, saying she and her mother were ill . They dined at The Buddha Bar and Restaurant attached to the resort on Friday night after checking in that afternoon . The discovery of the medications has . thrown fresh doubts over the cause of the deaths, but Richard Day, . Professor of Clinical Pharmacology at St Vincent’s Hospital, says the . drugs found were common among overseas travellers, describing them as . 'standard medicines'. 'There . would be a mixture of being cautious and being a health professional, . more cautious, in addition to having pre-existing conditions of asthma . and migraines,' he said. Arrangements . were being made to fly the bodies home at the earliest opportunity, but . it could take some time to determine the causes of death, due to the . discovery of the medications. 'There . are lots of samples from the vomit, the medicines and the drink,' head . of Denpasar Police Forensic Laboratory, Agus Budiartha, said. 'Since . they're all abroad medicines, from the country where they're from, we . might have some difficulties because it's not what's usually used in . Indonesia.' The bill for the meal shows the mother and daughter had juices, lemon tea, chicken, pizza and fish . The resort's hotel manager Giovanni Bareato denied the claim of food poisoning . Idyllic: The resorts and beaches of Bali attract millions of guests every year . Indonesian authorities have suggested . the mother and daughter died from an allergy and not poisoning, but the . family insists the pair did not suffer from allergies. 'We've been told it is fish they've eaten,' Mrs Bischoff's brother-in-law, Kevin Bowe said to the ABC. 'We are sticking to that at the moment. That was the report from DFAT (Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade).' The resort's hotel manager, Giovanni Bareato, has denied this. 'It's . a big fish so we would have eaten the same one,' Mr Bareato told The . Australian. 'We haven't fallen ill and I know of no one else who has . fallen ill from the food.' The . family is aware that results from overseas autopsies may not be . recognised by Indonesia's legal system, but say they aren’t looking for a . criminal conviction. 'We want the truth,' Keryn Bischoff, Nolene's sister-in-law, said. 'We want to know if it was an accident, or if it wasn't an accident.

Mr Chen, who made his fortune in recycling and renewable resources, handed out his card to journalists, including Adam Taylor of the Business Insider, earlier this week when he arrived in the US with two female burn victims, whom he had taken to New York for surgery. Exaggerating? Me?: Chen Guangbiao is China's 'Most Well-known', its 'Moral Leader' and 'Most Charismatic Philanthropist' according to his business card .

Mr Chen said he would acquire the rest of the funds to buy the newspaper from 'a Hong Kong tycoon'. He has said the paper, which has published investigations into the enormous wealth amassed by the relatives of Chinese leaders, should be more 'more authentic and objective' in its coverage of China. If his offer failed, Chen said he would extend offers to CNN, the Washington Post or the Wall Street Journal. 'As long as they have some influence, I'm still willing to consider buying lesser media outlets,' he said. He also warned Americans not to trust the government of Japan, which is involved in a territorial dispute with China over several remote islands.

Battle: Lady Fiona Hindlip, pictured in 2011 with her daughter Kirstie Allsopp, has died of breast cancer after she was first diagnosed with the disease in 1987 . The mother of television presenter Kirstie Allsopp has died of breast cancer, just months after the star's sister revealed she had undergone a double mastectomy to protect her from the disease. Lady Fiona Hindlip, an interior decorator, died at her home on Monday following a 26-year battle with the disease at the age of 66. Last year Kirstie's sister Sofie, also a television presenter, told how she had elected to have the cancer-prevention surgery over fears she might develop the disease, which also struck her maternal grandmother and other female relatives. Sofie, 33, underwent the preventative double mastectomy to remove . both her breasts in November 2010, followed by reconstructive surgery, in order to . reduce her cancer risk by 90 per cent. ‘I . have spent my life watching my . mother struggle with breast cancer, worried that I might lose her,' she . said, speaking out after actress Angeline Jolie revealed she had also . had the potentially life-saving surgery. 'So, . for me, it was a very simple, logical decision to remove a part of my . body which could potentially kill me.' The grandaughter of explosives magnate . Harry McGowan, Lady Hindlipp, married former Christie's chairman Lord . Charles Hindlip, 73, in 1968. As well as Kirstie and Sofie, the couple had two other children, art dealer Henry, 40, and Natasha, 27. Lady Hindlip was first diagnosed with cancer in 1987 and had a double mastectomy as well as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. She was in remission for seven years, undergoing further treatment when the breast cancer returned, but nine years later she was diagnosed with secondary cancer. Family tragedy: The death of Lady Hindlip came just months after Sofie Allsopp (left), revealed she had elected to have a double mastectomy after fears she might develop the disease . ‘Our mother is an incredibly brave woman who never let the cancer encroach on our lives,’ said Sofie last year. ‘She talked about it openly, but always tried to minimise the impact on us by being optimistic, very positive and pro-active about her treatment. 'She dealt with it with dignity and grace, trying to make the least of it.’ Kirstie added: ‘Mum was always very discreet, stoic and amazingly brave, but we were aware of the impact it had on her, and it was hard for us to see her suffer.’ Wife and mother: Lady Hindlip, pictured with her husband in 2011, had two other children, art dealer Henry, 40, and Natasha, 27 . Both Allsopp sisters were told by a geneticist that their chances of developing cancer could be as high as one in three. However, at the time Sofie spoke out about her operation, Kirstie, 42, said she had decided to opt for a wait-and-see approach and had instead decided to go for regular breast scans and adopt a healthier lifestyle.

Americans are eating more butter than they have in decades after a fear of trans fats and clean-food trends put the spread back on the menu. As a result, butter consumption is now at a 40-year-high with U.S. citizens eating 5.6lbs a year of the yellow stuff. This is an increase by 25 per cent in the last decade, after hitting a low of 4.1lbs per person in 1997. Utterly butterly: U.S. citizens now consume 5.6lbs of butter per person and year, according to the American Butter Institute - the highest level in 40 years . In comparison, sales of margarine have dropped as consumers try to avoid trans fats, found in processed foods or products where the qualities of natural fats have been mimicked. Trans fats increase cholesterol levels in the blood which can lead to heart attacks, strokes and heart disease. As the health hazards that follow high consumption of trans-fats have become common knowledge, demand for natural dairy products has increased. I can't believe it's butter: this graph shows the consumption per pound per person of margarine and butter from 1980 to 2010 . ‘Consumers are changing their perception of food and looking for healthier alternatives. 'They’re moving away from highly processed foods and artificial ingredients,’ Anuja Miner, executive director of the American Butter Institute, told the LA Times. Butter, being high in vitamins, . beneficial saturated fats, and ‘good cholesterol’ that is vital for . brain and nervous system development, is increasingly becoming the first . choice for cooking and sandwiches. Naturally fat: Fear of unhealthy trans fats, found in processed margarine, is believed to be the reason for the increase . ‘Everything tastes better with butter,’ David Riemersma, president of the American Butter Institute and head of Butterball Farms in Grand Rapids, Michigan told the paper. ‘Consumers also want real, natural wholesome products. They want to understand all the things on an ingredient list. Butter fits perfectly. It's either just cream or cream and salt.’ Recent guidelines from the Food and Drug Administration, have all but banned trans fats, and many U.S. companies, such as Unilever, has followed suit and removed it from their products. Meanwhile academics in Britain are comparing sugar to cigarettes, saying consumption levels must be reduced by 30 per cent to save public health. ‘Sugar is the new tobacco,’ said Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool. ‘Everywhere, sugary drinks and junk foods are now pressed on unsuspecting parents and children by a cynical  industry focused on profit not health. Reducing added sugar to products by 20-30 per cent would be enough to halt or even reverse rising levels of obesity and associated ill-health, US-UK campaign group – Action on Sugar claimed.","Americans consume 5.6lbs of butter per person and year .

The attack, the father has said, left him fearing for his life. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Shocking: The assault was filmed by the parents' daughter on her mobile phone . The astonishing incident took place at a Carrefour store in the Spanish seaside resort of Torrevieja over the Christmas holidays. It began when the parents, from France, activated an alarm at the till. Under suspicion of stealing, they were told to walk back and forth through security gates, but the alarm on these remained silent. Recounting the tale: The mother and father describe their ordeal . However, rather than being allowed to leave, the situation dramatically escalated. They claim that they were taken into a room and spat upon – and then physically attacked. What happened next left the mother and father needing hospital treatment. The father describes how he was restrained with a chokehold . The mother told how her son could not stop crying when he witnessed the attack . The guards refused to believe that the pair were innocent and, as the footage shows, grappled with them very roughly. At one point a guard appears to punch the mother several times. The father was restrained by a choke hold and is clearly in pain. He told El Mundo: 'They grabbed my neck and I thought I was going to die in Spain.’ His wife said: ‘My youngest child couldn't stop crying, I couldn't console him. ‘If they had found something, well that's different, but I didn't have anything. They looked everywhere and didn't find anything.’ The pair were treated at a local hospital before complaining to the local police. They were forced to wait several days before the matter could be dealt with because officials couldn’t find a translator. The security firm the guards work for has yet to comment, but the supermarket that uses its services has asked for a response after acknowledging that the assault took place, according to El Mundo.","The harrowing ordeal took place in a supermarket in Torrevieja .

Scene: Hser and her family lived at this South Salt Lake complex, where she reportedly befriended Met . Her father recounted their fears as they waited for news of their missing daughter. 'The night [she disappeared] my . wife was crying,' Wah said. 'It had been too long, so we assumed, we . thought maybe our daughter is already dead.' 'I'll never forget the look on [the mother's] face,' caseworker Carrie Pender told the court on Thursday. 'Just the fear in her eyes that she couldn't find her little girl.' Hser was described as a happy, smart little girl who loved going to Sunday . school, was quickly learning English and was a delight to family, . friends and her teachers. His wife, Pearlly Wah, sobbed as she added: 'This is the biggest loss of my life. If you . gave me the whole world of happiness to exchange for this little girl, I . would say no. Nothing can pay me back because I only had one. Whenever I . see little girls run around, it breaks my heart.' Defense lawyers say no one saw Met . take or kill Hser and that DNA found from his jacket and from beneath . her fingernails were from games the two had shared in days before the . murder. Investigation: FBI agent James Lamadrid testifies on Tuesday as crime scene photos were shown . Explanation: Defense attorney Michael Peterson brings out a world map during the defense's opening. The family and the alleged killer were both Burmese refugees seeking a better life in Utah . Met, who had also been living in a Burmese refugee camp in Thailand before moving to the U.S., moved to the apartment about a month before the slaying. He lived at the house with four roommates, but defense attorneys say they shunned him because he was a Muslim man of Indian origin. The roommates were arrested on April 1, 2008 but they were later released. Police said they had not been home at the time of the killing and did not know her body was in the basement bathroom. Met has pleaded not guilty to the charges. The trial is expected to continue through January 24.","Hser Ner Moo's body was found in a pool of blood in the bottom of Esar Met's shower in Salt Lake City, Utah in March 2008 .

"PUBLISHED: . 05:23 EST, 9 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 19:07 EST, 9 January 2014 . Tribunal: Shopping channel presenter Charlie Vernon was sacked by Gems TV for swearing at abusive colleagues on live TV . A TV presenter was sacked after she made a rude gesture on the air at colleagues who were taunting her with insults through her earpiece. Charlie Vernon, 28, stuck up her middle finger – and a viewer complained. What the viewer did not know, however, was that male colleagues had been trying to distract the presenter through her earpiece with a string of personal comments. The banter became increasingly abusive. They called her a '****ing big whore' and 'big bitch' while she was hosting the Jewellery Maker Show on Gems TV in May last year. The former CBBC and GMTV presenter has now been awarded £3,250 after suing her former employers, the Redditch-based TV company Genuine Gemstone Company, which sacked her for bringing the firm into disrepute. She lost a claim for unfair dismissal and victimisation at a Birmingham tribunal, but won her case for sexual harassment. The presenter, who now works for Channel 5, told the tribunal she had tried to laugh off the distraction at first. 'I was shocked and extremely offended to be called a ****ing big whore and a bitch on my earpiece,' she said. 'There's always the odd distraction joke among the camera crews during transmission, but it's usually innocent and friendly. I've never been insulted before by such crude language.' Miss Vernon, from Bath, added: 'I did my best to carry on with the show despite what was going on.' The tribunal was shown  a ten-minute film of the incident, in which Miss Vernon is seen laughing nervously before becoming angry. Abuse: Miss Vernon lost her temper when somebody swore at her so she decided to stick up her middle finger, leading to a complaint and then her dismissal . Partial victory: The broadcaster lost a claim for unfair dismissal an victimisation but was awarded £3,250 compensation for sexual harassment at an employment tribunal . She insisted that she had not realised . her response had been seen by viewers. One mother complained to the . show and said she and her 12-year-old daughter had been watching the . programme and found the gesture  'disgusting'. Paul . Roberts, representing the Genuine Gemstone Company, said Miss Vernon's . gesture could have brought the firm's reputation into disrepute. He also . claimed the presenter had been threatened with losing her job two weeks . before the incident. After a two-day hearing, tribunal . chairman Victoria Dean agreed that she had been sexually harassed. She . said calling a work colleague a 'big whore' and a 'bitch' was completely . unacceptable. However, she rejected Miss Vernon's claim for unfair . dismissal after declaring the TV firm had acted 'within the range of . reasonable responses'. The . claim for victimisation was also rejected by the chairman who described . the situation as a 'one-off.' Miss Vernon declined to comment. The . Genuine Gemstone Company said: 'This incident occurred between the two . individuals and both were dismissed for their behaviour.'","Charlie Vernon, 28, waved her middle finger on shopping channel Gems TV .

Most youngsters hate the sight of the  bath – but here’s at least one cheeky little monkey who can’t get enough of the hot tub. These Japanese macaques, or snow monkeys, have taken to plunging into hot springs to protect themselves from the fierce, freezing conditions of the snowy highlands where they live. They learned of the benefits of the springs just 50 years ago, copying humans who bathed in the boiling water that bubbles out of crevices in the frozen ground in an area known as Hell’s Valley. Japanese Macaque baby enjoying a relaxing moment in a hot spring, in Jigokudani, Japan . In order to avoid clashes over the hot water, a special pool for the monkeys was built higher up in the valley, away from people. Boasting its own waterfalls, soaking pool and resting ledges, the Jigokudani Yaen-koen Monkey Park in central Japan is now home to about 200 macaques. Living in the icy Japanese highlands, these monkeys have adopted a rather unusual pastime to keep warm - heading to the hot tub . With their double layer of thick fur they are able to withstand temperatures as low as of minus 15 degrees centigrade. But when it is at its coldest the clever primates have a second line of defence - spending much of their days bathing in hot springs . The warm-water dips are a useful second line of defence for the primates, who have a double layer of thick fur that enables them to withstand temperatures as low as -15C. The intelligent monkeys also make snowballs just for fun, and have been seen indulging in playful fights.","Japanese macaques, or snow monkeys, taken to plunging into hot springs .

BAE Systems said the metal components were successfully used on board Tornado aircraft which flew from the defence firm's airfield at Warton, Lancashire, late last month. The company said its engineers are using 3D technology to design and produce parts which could cut the Royal Air Force's maintenance and service bill by over £1.2 million over the next four years. UK fighter jets have flown for the first time with parts made using 3D printing technology . BAE Systems is working at RAF Marham, Norfolk, to engineer ready-made parts for four squadrons of Tornado GR4 aircraft, including protective covers for cockpit radios and guards for power take-off shafts. Some of the parts cost less than £100. Mike Murray, head of airframe integration at BAE Systems, said: 'You are suddenly not fixed in terms of where you have to manufacture these things. 'You can manufacture the products at whatever base you want, providing you can get a machine there, which means you can also start to support other platforms such as ships and aircraft carriers. 'And if it's feasible to get machines out on the front line, it also gives improved capability where we wouldn't traditionally have any manufacturing support.' BAE Systems said the metal components were successfully used on board Tornado aircraft . While 3D printing is seen as a positive technology by many – it is thought it can revolutionise engineering and the medical industries – it is also a controversial innovation. In the United States, several guns have been produced using the technology, with varying degrees of success. One of the latest models, which includes a rifled barrel to ensure deadly accuracy, is said to have been made with just £15 of materials. The latest generation of 3D printers work by building up layer upon layer of material - typically plastic - to build complex solid objects. The guns are assembled from separate printed components made from plastic, with only the firing pin and a few bolts made from metal. The Home Office in the UK said it will not be possible to ban 3D printers, so officials are working on alternative strategies. These could include stiff jail sentences for possession of the weapons and making it illegal to download the plans. In the US, more than 100,000 plans for a plastic gun known as 'The Liberator' were downloaded within hours. The explosion of interest provoked the government into ordering the Texas-based company, Defense Distributed, who produced them to take them down. It used a 3D printer that cost £5,140 from the online auction site eBay to make the parts which, when assembled, create a working handgun. Defense Distributed’s leader Cody Wilson was voted the 14th most dangerous person in the world in November. Dangerous: Cody Wilson, of Defense Distributed, with the first completely 3D-printed handgun, The Liberator . But it is also hoped 3D printing will be used for the right reasons as well. For instance, the technology is already proven to be capable of making food. In November, Rolls-Royce said it could use 3D printing on its models in the future. And last week, the world’s first chocolate 3D printer was unveiled. A company called Choc Edge has designed the machine that allows users to build any 3D shape out of chocolate - including their own face. Customers can send an image of themselves through the company's website and the machine creates a thick layered chocolate portrait for between £50 and £80. The machine, called Choc Creator, works by squirting out chocolate according to computer instructions and allows a user to build any shape they like out of the sweet liquid. This photograph shows the world's first chocolate 3D printer, unveiled last week . The technology of 3D printing has been hailed as the future of manufacturing. It works by building up layer upon layer of material - typically plastic - to build complex solid objects . The process, also called additive manufacturing, creates a three-dimensional solid object from a digital model. The feat is achieved by laying down layer upon layer of plastic. The layers are then joined together to create the final shape. The machine takes blueprints from computer aided designs and 'slices' them into digital cross-sections that the machine uses as a guideline for printing. The process of addictive manufacturing has been in use on a large industrial scale since the early 1980s. However, since 2010, an entire industry has sprung up around personal 3D printers, which are increasingly small, increasingly powerful and increasingly affordable. Engineers hope 3D printing will begin an era of 'instant prototyping' that will allow product developers to forge and tinker with prototypes quickly and inexpensively.","BAE Systems said metal components were successfully used on the company's flight from airfield in Warton, Lancashire, late last month .

A former Auburn University basketball star faked her own kidnapping after the college's intense training schedule drove her to alcoholism, her mother and coach have revealed. Tennessee-born Sierra 'Cece' Sims, a popular student at high school and  talented basketball player, was scouted for the Alabama college and moved the 300 miles to start as a freshman in 2008. But after just two months, she succumbed to the pressure of the grueling training schedule and classes and turned to binge-drinking as a way out. And then she went missing, sparking a widespread search and Amber Alert. Stress: Former Auburn University basketball star Sierra 'Cece' Sims, pictured in 2008, faked her own kidnapping after the college's intense training schedule drove her to alcoholism, her mother and coach have revealed . He mom, Kathie Sims, recalled Cece, who was crowned home coming queen, as a bubbly, energetic high school player who liked to enjoy herself. 'She had a lot of fun, like every other high school player did, just a lot of, what we saw, good, healthy fun,' Ms Sims told ABC News' 20/20. But she was also an extremely talented basketball player, helping her school team secure three titles.'I remember when my assistant coach came to me and said, ""You have got to come watch this kid play,""' Nell Fortner, the former head coach of women's basketball at Auburn University. She gave her a full scholarship. But the demands of being a student-athlete were tough. 'Your schedule might take you to the Bahamas or Czech Republic or to Hawaii,' Fortner said. 'They are going to get a great education tutoring. But they pay heavily for that because working out is tough. They are up at 5 in the morning, and they don't get to bed 'til 11 at night.' Soon, Cece, then an 18-year-old freshman, had turned to alcohol and even asked her mother, Kathie Sims, if she could come home. Promising athlete: Cece, left with her mother Kathie Sims, was a popular student at high school and talented basketball player . But her mom instead suggested she talk through what was bothering her with someone she could trust. So one night, Cece called her coach to tell her about a campus concert she attended. 'I was like, ""I am glad you are enjoying it, but, remember, we have practice at 6 in the morning, so make sure you set your alarm,""' Fortner recalled. 'She goes, ""Oh yeah... I have got 5 alarms set.""' Fortner said that because her energy and her personality was always so bubbly, nobody thought for one second there was a problem. But Sims didn't show up to practice the next day, something which immediately concerned Fortner. 'I have never felt... the pit in my stomach, the way that I felt it, when we couldn't find Cece,' the coach told 20/20. Students reported seeing a commotion at Cece's dorm, and that she had bolted out the back door and rode off into the night on her bicycle. This kicked off a widespread search for the teen, involving local police, the FBI and the State Troopers. 'An Amber Alert (was issued)...it spread like wildfire,' said Fortner. Kidnapping: But after just two months, she succumbed to the pressure of the grueling training schedule and turned to binge-drinking as a way out. She then disappeared, sparking a widespread search and Amber Alert . After 24 terrifying hours, a police officer came across Cece. 'One of the policemen who were searching for her almost hit her,' Kathie Sims told the program. 'She looked right at him and said, ""I'm Cece Sims,"" and he just melted.' Back at the police station, Cece told a harrowing tale claiming she was abducted by a man and a woman in a truck. 'Cece said that she walked out of the dorm and a truck pulled up,' Fortner recalled. 'It was a man and a woman, and they dragged her into the truck...they forced pills and alcohol down her, and, there, they kidnapped her.' However, the story was made up - she faked the kidnapping to escape the intense pressure she was feeling from the Auburn athletics program, her mother said. In fact, she had ran out of her dorm, rode to a Walmart just miles from the college and drank for 18 hours straight. Getting back on her feet: After claiming she was kidnapped to get out of college, she is still working to get back on her feet and has turned to music . Cece decided to come clean about the story in a video posted on the website iamsecond.com, explaining why she did it. 'I didn't want to disappoint my parents. And so I thought, ""What better of a way than to say I was kidnapped?"" That way, I wouldn't have to quit and be known as a quitter,' she said in the video. Her mom added to 20/20, 'Clearly she was desperate to get out.' Now, five years after the incident, Cece is still working to get back on her feet, Kathie Sims explained, adding that the now 23-year-old is living at home and is in counseling. 'She's not out of the woods yet. But she is going to be okay,' she said. And after what they've been through, the mom gave a word of advice to other parents of star athletes.

A dog reported missing two years ago has been rescued by fishermen who spotted it swimming off the Florida coast. The dog was wearing a collar with the name Baby on it when she was found two miles off Tampa at 7.30am on Thursday morning last week. A microchip led vets to a report showing the dog had first been reported missing two years ago and that her owner had died a couple of months ago. Overboard: Baby the dog with her new owner Kathy Klein, who adopted her after the dog was found two miles out to sea . Mystery: The dog was wearing a collar with the name Baby on it and had been microchipped . Baby, who appeared groomed and well-cared for, was spotted by the crew of a commercial fishing vessel, who could just make her out in the water. 'On the horizon they could see just her . nose sticking out of the water,' Anthony Basile, a resident who temporarily took the dog in after the crew returned her to Demens Landing. I put towels on her. Warm towels on her, put the heat on in the boat. She shook for ten hours straight,' he told the Tampa Bay Times. It is thought Baby could have been in the sea, which was 68F, for up to eight hours. 'We're assuming she fell overboard at night and nobody even knew it,' Suzy Johnson, who helped look after the dog, said. When she was found in the water, the dog had a red collar with diamante studs spelling out the name Baby. Rescue: Anthony Basile nursed Baby back to health after the fishermen who found her brought the dog ashore . Bond: After being rescued by Anthony, the dog refused to let him out of her sight . Caring: Anthony with Baby on his boat in Demens Landing. The dog shook for about ten hours after being saved from the sea . When Banfield Pet Hospital scanned her . microchip, staff discovered she had been listed as missing two years ago. They also found three phone numbers including one that led them to a man in Virginia . who said Baby had belonged to his sister, Charlene Knotts, who died aged 40, two months ago. The man said he . believed his sister's roommate had been caring for Baby, and didn't know . how she could have ended up in the sea, Fox 13 reported. 'Baby was her little lap dog. She fed Baby off her fork and they had quite the relationship,' Deborah Clements, who had lived with Ms Knotts said. The dog was being cared for by a third roommate who found a new home for Baby on Craigslist, but after a couple of days the dog ran away in December. When she was found on January 2, Mr Basile took her in and Baby bonded with him immediately. He had been on his way to the marina office to pay his rent when the fisherman who found her stopped him. After managing to coax her out of the crawl space she was hiding in on their boat, Baby refused to let Mr Basile out of her sight. 'I can't take a step off the boat and she'll start screaming and yelling. I walk with her; she stays right by my side,' he told WFLA. 'I don't know how she made it through this. It's truly not possible. But she did it, somehow. She was out two miles,' he said. New start: Kathy Klein and her husband Larry have adopted the dog and renamed her Gracie . Forever home: The dog has found a new family after being rescued from the sea . Unfortunately he wasn't able to offer Baby a home permanently, but a Florida couple who heard about her story and had offered to help have now adopted her. 'Initially, I wanted to just go meet the . people that were so kind to rescue her,' Kathy Klein said. 'I went and got . a dog bed and a blanket and a dog coat because I knew it was going to . get cold.' But as she helped nurse Baby back to health, and trimmed the knots out of her bedraggled fur, Mrs Klein fell in love with the dog. As well as offering Baby a new home, Mrs Klein has also given her a new name - Gracie - because 'purely by the grace of God did she survive all of this'.","Fishermen rescue dog named Baby after spotting it swimming in the sea .

Former X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos today made her first appearance at crown court accused of brokering a cocaine deal. The N-Dubz star, of Friern Barnet, north London, is charged with helping an undercover reporter obtain 13.9g of the Class A drug for £860. She appeared alongside rapper Mike GLC, also known as Michael Coombs, 35, of Enfield, north London, for a preliminary hearing at Southwark Crown Court in Central London. Contostavlos, 25, denies being ‘concerned with the supply of 13.9 grams of cocaine’ to The Sun on Sunday's undercover reporter Mazher Mahmood, known as the ‘fake sheikh’, between May 20 and May 24. Coombs denies a charge of supplying the drug on May 23. She was told her trial is expected to take place on July 14 -  the day after her 26th birthday. Dressed in a black jacket and skirt, she appeared alongside Coombs for a 10-minute preliminary hearing. The pair spoke only to confirm their names and say they understood the current timetable. There will also be a case management hearing on March 27. Contostavlos allegedly set up the transaction after telling Mr Mahmood she could help provide him with ‘white sweets’, which is claimed to have been code for cocaine. She is accused of playing a ‘significant role’ of putting the fake sheikh in touch with Coombs before the pair met at the upmarket Dorchester Hotel in Central London. The Sun on Sunday recorded the meeting in which Coombs is said to have handed over half an ounce of cocaine. Contostavlos was initially arrested in connection with the incident with Coombs on June 4.

A Super Puma that crashed into the North Sea killing 16 men was declared fit for service the day before the tragedy, an inquiry has heard. The helicopter plunged into the water off the Aberdeenshire coast while returning from the BP Miller platform in 2009. A fatal accident inquiry (FAI) is being held before a sheriff in Aberdeen almost five years after the accident. Victims: (Top row, from the left) James Costello, Vernon Elrick, Brian Barkley, Raymond Doyle, Warren Mitchell (middle row, from left) Gareth Hughes, David Rae, Nairn Ferrier, Stuart Wood and Richard Menzies, (bottom row, from left) James Edwards, Alex Dallas, Leslie Taylor, Nolan Carl Goble and Paul Burnham who were 15 of the 16 people killed when a helicopter crashed into the North Sea . Fourteen oil workers and two crew were killed when the aircraft hit the sea on April 1. Many of them worked for KCA Deutag Drilling and were returning from BP’s Miller platform when the crash happened. An investigation into the crash has found the aircraft suffered a 'catastrophic failure' of its main rotor gearbox. James Gilmour, former engineering director at Bond Offshore Helicopters, gave evidence on the third day of the inquiry before Sheriff Principal Derek Pyle. Technical logs for the helicopter were shown to the inquiry demonstrating that licensed engineers carried out scheduled maintenance the day before the fatal accident. This included inspections of both engines and the personal locator beacons on the helicopter. After-flight inspections were also carried out that day, the inquiry was told. A hearse carrying the bodies of victims of the helicopter crash drives away from a support vessel, the Caledonian Victory, in Aberdeen harbour, on April 2, 2009 . Mr Gilmour, who now works as an aviation consultant, said: 'There were no defects during the flights for that day.' Referring to the technical record of the work completed by the engineers, he said: 'It has been signed off at the bottom saying the aircraft is fit for service.' Mr Gilmour told the inquiry there was an additional recurrent inspection (ARI) put in place for the helicopter gearbox on March 25 after the aircraft’s chip detector picked up a magnetic particle. 'It has been signed off at the bottom saying the aircraft is fit for service' - James Gilmour, former engineering director at Bond Offshore Helicopters, referring to the technical record of the work completed by the engineers . The ARI ordered that the magnetic chip plugs of the gearbox be inspected at every shutdown of the aircraft for the next 25 flight hours. The checks were carried out and signed off, according to documents shown to the inquiry. Mr Gilmour said: 'Nothing was found during all these inspections. There were no chips found and the ARI was closed.' Fiscal depute Geoffrey Main, for the Crown, asked if Mr Gilmour was aware of the ARI at the time. He said: 'No, this is day-to-day work carried out in the hangar. I don’t get involved down to that level.' He said he was not made aware of the discovery of the particle on March 25 until after the crash. Mr Gilmour said he would not necessarily expect to have been told about the particle, stating it was 'not that uncommon'. The BP Miller gas platform in the North Sea. The helicopter was flying from here to the mainland when it crashed . He said that in the hours and days after the accident, as investigators worked to discover its cause, the particle 'wasn’t high on my radar at that time'. A report by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) found the gearbox failure caused the main rotor on the AS332-L2 model to break away and its 'tail boom' got severed from the fuselage. The inquiry at the Town House in Aberdeen is expected to last about six weeks and will examine the circumstances of the crash in order to prevent any future tragedy. Captain and co-pilot Paul Burnham, 31, from Methlick in Aberdeenshire, and Richard Menzies, 24, from Droitwich Spa in Worcestershire, were killed with 14 oil industry workers. Five men from Aberdeen died: Alex Dallas, 62, James Costello, 24, Stuart Wood, 27, Vernon Elrick, 41, and Brian Barkley, 30. Two workers were from Aberdeenshire: Leslie Taylor, 41, from Kintore, and Warren Mitchell, 38, from Oldmeldrum. The other victims were Raymond Doyle, 57, from Cumbernauld; David Rae, 63, from Dumfries; Gareth Hughes, 53, from Angus; Nairn Ferrier, 40, from Dundee; James Edwards, 33, from Liverpool; Nolan Goble, 34, from Norwich; and Mihails Zuravskis, 39, from Latvia. Some of the victims’ families have expressed anger that there has been no criminal prosecution following the crash. There have also been calls for a full public inquiry into helicopter safety to be held. Documents shown to the inquiry indicated that the ARI was signed off by an engineer shortly after 6am on the morning of the crash. Mr Gilmour agreed that the helicopter could not have flown on that day unless all related work orders for the aircraft had been completed and closed. He is expected to continue his evidence to the inquiry tomorrow. The fatal crash happened just six weeks after a Super Puma EC225 ditched as it approached a production platform owned by BP. All 18 people on board survived this accident. In May 2012 the same model of helicopter, destined for an oil platform, went down about 30 miles off the coast of Aberdeen and its 14 passengers and crew had to be rescued. Five months later another EC225 carrying an oil crew from Aberdeen to a rig 86 miles north-west of Shetland was forced to ditch. The 17 passengers and two crew were rescued from life rafts by a passing boat. New advice on checks for the EC225 model were issued following the accidents. Four oil workers were killed when their Super Puma L2 plunged into the sea off Shetland on August 23 last year.

His home is a graveyard, his job, shoplifting and his skin, cracked and pitted with psoriasis - the result of sleeping rough and a raging addiction to heroin and crack. Shanki, a 30-something from India's Punjab region, is just one of the estimated 600,000 illegal immigrants currently thought to live in Britain. But as new Fergal Keane documentary, The Hidden World of Britain's Immigrants, reveals, the British dream all too often proves a nightmare. Bleak: Keane inside Shanki's dilapidated squat before he is thrown out and forced to sleep rough . Along with Shanki, others to appear in the film, which focuses on the London borough of Ilford, include Harish, another Punjabi rough sleeper who has resorted to industrial quantities of alcohol to get through the day, and Lucky, a persistent thief. Yet despite their appalling living conditions and inability to get a job, the men say they would prefer stay in the UK rather than lose face by returning home to their families empty handed. 'I am crazy for drugs. I do not look after myself or my body,' Shanki reveals. 'But I don't have the willpower [to stop]. He adds: 'I . am ashamed to go home and you know why? I have been here nine years and I . have f***ing zero. 'I don't want to go to India like this, never, ever. Really, I need to stop the drugs. I'm finished man, I'm finished. Finished, finished, finished.' Grim: Like this group of migrants found camping in a Heathrow underpass, Shanki sleeps rough . Problem: A quarter of London's homeless are from Eastern Europe, including the Romanians of Marble Arch . But it isn't just migrants from India and Pakistan who arrive to discover that the UK is a far less welcoming place than they anticipated. Eastern Europeans now make up a quarter of London's rough sleepers, and Lithuanian Oksana is one of them. She came to the UK with the help of a fixer who had promised her a job but he soon disappeared, leaving her to struggle alone. As an EU citizen, Oksana is entitled to benefits but is filmed sleeping rough while she and her husband wait for the payments to begin. 'I was thinking England might be easier, you [can] find work easier,' she explains, but as a former heroin addict with a conviction for shoplifting, getting a job has proved difficult. She adds: 'Of course we are sad about the situation.' Difficult: Many who overstay are not picked up because the Border Agency doesn't monitor exit records . When Keane returns three months later, the pair are still unemployed but have moved into a house paid for by their benefits. 'Every week we get £72 [each]. So £100 for Steve [their landlord] and £44 for us. In Lithuania we don't have anything like this.' Although the pair say they are searching for work, Oksana admits she turned down a cleaning job in a hotel because of an old injury picked up while addicted to drugs. By contrast, Shanki and his friends are desperate for work but find it even more of a struggle thanks to their lack of work visas. 'Nowadays everybody is scared,' explains Shanki. 'If they . find [an] illegal immigrant in any job, [the employer is given a] £10,000 fine. That's why they don't . give job to anyone without passport or visa.' For some, the answer is to throw in the towel and go home. Among those to choose voluntary repatriation is Setal, a former Indian Army soldier. 'I have never stolen anything, I have . never gone to jail,' he tells Keane. 'I do not have any such record - I have a clean . record here. Complaints: Shopkeepers in Ilford have complained about the antisocial behaviour of Shanki and his friends . 'There is a rule in the [Indian] army that if you come home in nine . years, your pension continues. That's why I want to get home.' Parminder Singh, an elder and magistrate at Ilford's Sikh temple, which provides food for unlucky migrants such as Setal, thinks he's making the right decision. A third generation Briton, Mr Singh is proud of his father and grandfather's contribution to the UK, including stints fighting for the Allies in the World Wars, but says he feels threatened by the antisocial behaviour of Shanki and his friends. 'This . is my country. I need a visa to go somewhere else but I don't need a . visa to be here,' he explains. 'I'm not saying they're bad people. It's the system that has allowed them to be trafficked and brought over . here. Moving on: Keane with Setal who has now returned home to India after volunteering for repatriation . 'I feel they have a lot of contributions to make to . their own countries and they should get back there and do it.' For Setal, a plane ticket home really is the end of the nightmare but for others, Shanki among them, things just get worse. Several months after Keane first meets him, he's been sent to prison after being caught red-handed stealing £1,500 of clothes from a local Marks & Spencer. It's his fourth prison term and the Home Office have asked to see his files - the start of the deportation process. Despite his hopes of a better life, it seems that for Shanki, his British nightmare could be coming to an end.

An international media frenzy over reports North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's uncle was executed by being thrown to a pack of dogs appears to have originated as satire on a Chinese microblogging website. The story, which spread like wildfire after it was picked up by a Hong Kong-based newspaper, has created an image that Pyongyang's young ruler is even more brutal and unpredictable than previously believed. While North Korea has said it purged and executed Kim's uncle, Jang Song Thaek, last month, it did not release details of how the man who was once the second most powerful figure in the isolated country was killed. False: Reports that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's uncle Jang Song Thaek (pictured two behind his nephew) was executed by being thrown to dogs are now thought to have come from a satirical blog post . Condemned: Jang Song Thaek (second right) is escorted in court before being executed. North Korea has not released details about how he was killed . Initial speculation was that Jang had been killed by firing squad, a fate that media outlets said was the usual one reserved for 'traitors'. However, an alternative narrative of the 67-year old's death emerged on what appears to have been a satirical post on the Chinese Tencent Weibo site that has been repeated by many media outlets worldwide. The December 11 post on Tencent Weibo, which was viewed 290,000 times, said Jang and five aides were killed by dogs. The Hong Kong-based Wen Wei Po newspaper then released an article and a screenshot of the Weibo post which it used to justify its report that Jang had been torn apart. Wen Wei Po, although independent, is viewed as being pro-Beijing. Its report was in turn picked up 12 days later by the Singapore-based Straits Times and then by a wide range of US and European media from print to television. Threat: Kim Jong Un, believed to be around 30 years old, has been in power for two years and presided over a nuclear test and two rocket test launches that are banned under United Nations sanctions . Kim Jong Un, believed to be around 30 years old, has been in power for two years and presided over a nuclear test and two rocket test launches that are banned under United Nations sanctions. In 2013, Pyongyang threatened to strike South Korea, the United States and Japan in fiery rhetoric that triggered an arms buildup in East Asia. One of the pitfalls of reporting on North Korea is that few independent media have offices there and visiting media are tightly controlled in a country which ranks among the lowest in global surveys of press freedom. Because of the lack of first hand information, many lurid stories about the country gain credence. Trevor Powell, a Chicago-based software engineer, who first spotted the link to the Weibo post and reported it on his own blog said that analysts and experts were 'still all missing the obvious fact that the original source of the Wen Wei Po story was a tweet from a known satirist or someone posing as him/her.' Officials at Wen Wei Po declined to comment.","Story had emerged that Jang Song Thaek and five aides were killed by dogs .

There are only enough honeybees in Britain to properly pollinate a quarter of the country’s crops, scientists claim. Destruction of huge swathes of grassland and the use of agricultural chemicals have caused a spiralling drop in the populations of honeybees, which are vital for food production. Professor Simon Potts of the University of Reading, who led the research project, said: ‘We face a catastrophe in future years unless we act now.’ Destruction of huge swathes of grassland and the use of agricultural chemicals have caused a spiralling drop in the populations of honeybees, which are vital for food production . The research, published in the journal PLOS One, found that Europe has 13.4million too few honeybee colonies to properly pollinate all its crops. Bee populations have plummeted as their meadowland habitats were concreted over and their wildflower food supply killed by herbicides. Previous studies have estimated that the number of British honeybees have halved over the last 25 years. Scientists think the bee shortfall is leading to reduced crop yields and they warn that in future farmers may have to look at mechanical or hand pollination. Professor Potts added: ‘Wild pollinators need greater protection. Research by the University of Reading found that Europe has 13.4million too few honeybee colonies to properly pollinate all its crops. The maps show the capacity of national honeybee colonies to supply demand for pollination services, in 2005 (e) and 2010 (f) ‘They are the unsung heroes of the countryside, providing a critical link in the food chain for humans and doing work for free that would otherwise cost British farmers £1.8billion to replace.’ Overall, the 41 European countries studied have only two-thirds of the honeybees they need. But the problem is particularly acute in Britain, where there are only 275,000 colonies – a quarter of the one million colonies needed to maximise yields. A bee colony can vary in size from 20,000 to 60,000 bees. Professor Potts said the demand for insect . pollinators is increasing as demand grows, particularly for oil crops . such as oilseed rape and sunflowers.

Manchester United have been going steadily off the rails since David Moyes took over, but defeat to Swansea on Sunday has turned their season into a train wreck. It was only the second time since 1984 they have been dumped out in the FA Cup third round – it only happened once under Sir Alex Ferguson – and the records keep tumbling for Moyes like the Old Trafford empire crumbling around him. Ferguson's shadow looms large over the new United manager from the directors' box at every home game – and he will not be impressed with what he is seeing. VIDEO Scroll down to watch David Moyes' assessment after the defeat against Swansea . Waving goodbye to success? Manchester United have limped to seventh in the Premier League and are out of the FA Cup at the first possible stage . Hands on hips: United have lost their games in clusters so far this season and look a tired outfit . Problems: Wilfried Bony's late header condemned United to a 2-1 defeat at Old Trafford against Swansea . Sober: The problems facing David Moyes are growing as each weekend goes by . All good things come to an end – but it's an issue when they all start coming to an end at the same time. This season at Old Trafford Moyes has overseen United's first defeat by Newcastle since 1972, the first defeat by West Bromwich Albion since 1978 and the first defeat by Everton since 1992. Add their first home loss to Swansea in 82 years and Moyes has ended a total of 179 years of utter domination on their own turf over four top-flight clubs. Ferguson never lost four out of six home games, and that was in 27 years at the helm. His replacement has 'achieved' that within eight months. The defeat by Swansea was their fifth home loss in all competitions this season, already equalling their title-winning campaign last year. Fans are getting disgruntled. Old Trafford emptied when Wilfried Bony headed Swansea's last-minute winner. Under Ferguson most would've stayed in the belief they could still get something from the game. Lonely souls: Old Trafford emptied quickly after Swansea's second goal on Sunday . Moyes is not helped by having Ferguson sat in the directors' box, looking down on proceedings like a Roman emperor overseeing a gladiatorial battle at the Colosseum and deciding at the end who lives and who dies by sticking his thumb in the air or pointing it to the ground. There is a flash of fear in the United manager's eyes after every defeat at Old Trafford as if he knows Ferguson could give him the thumbs down at any moment and he would be for the chop.

Click here to read Chris Wheeler's assessment of Manchester United's 2-1 FA Cup defeat against Swansea City. Everyone says Moyes deserves to be given time like Ferguson, but they are forgetting that Ferguson didn't inherit a title-winning team when he got the job in 1986. It took four years for him to win his first major trophy – the 1990 FA Cup – but when he took over they hadn't won a top-flight title in 19 years. This United have won it five times in the past 10. Andre Villas-Boas had three more Premier League points after 20 games in charge at Chelsea than Moyes's 34 now. The Portuguese lost his job shortly afterwards. Being brutally honest, Moyes simply doesn't know how to compete with the giants of the game when it comes to transfers. His first marquee signing, buying Marouane Fellaini for £27.5million weeks after a £23m release clause expired, has so far been a disaster. Disaster: Marouane Fellaini was United's marquee summer signing but has been a spectacular flop . But Moyes doesn't know how to play with this kind of money. The average net spending per season during his 11 years at Everton was a mere £803,000. Ferguson would shell out tens of millions every summer like he was handing out sweets. Moyes's admission after the defeat by Swansea that United's transfer targets might not be available in January is alarming. Ferguson would never have come out with a comment like that. If Manchester United wanted a player, Manchester United got a player. United's credentials for finishing in a Champions League spot are being seriously questioned now, let alone challenging for the title. Moyes has presided over their worst points total from their opening 20 games in 22 years and they have won only two matches – versus Arsenal and Hull – against sides in the top half. They have been beaten by Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Southampton, Tottenham twice, Everton and Newcastle. Thanks for coming! Tottenham's 2-1 win on New Year's Day was United's sixth league defeat of the season . Happy hunting ground: Yohan Cabaye scored the only goal when Newcastle won at United in early December . Never rains: The Newcastle defeat followed a 1-0 reverse against Everton, thanks to Bryan Oviedo's goal . Neil Warnock claims that Sir Alex Ferguson watching Man United matches isn't helping David Moyes - click here for full story. Rio Ferdinand has managed only 13 appearances this season – a mere seven of those in the Barclays Premier League – and, aged 35, he is way past his peak. For many of his 12 years at Old Trafford the former England defender has been the best centre back in the country but the player has admitted this season could be his last. Chris Smalling is being brought through as first-choice centre back by Moyes, but the 24-year-old has been a weak link in their defence. They have kept only two clean sheets in 13 league games with him in the side. Manchester United are unbeaten when Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie have started together. The only problem is, Moyes has been able to field them in his first eleven only six times, winning four of those and drawing the other two. Both of their futures at the club are in doubt. Rooney wants to wait until after the World Cup this summer to make a decision on signing a new contract and Moyes has admitted if they don't qualify for the Champions League he may well leave. Van Persie's relationship with the Scot has also been strained. There were reports in Holland, denied by Moyes, of a bust-up between the pair. While the Dutchman has been on fire when he's played, with 16 goals in 20 appearances for club and country this season, he has missed the last month with a troublesome thigh injury. Better together: United are unbeaten when Wayne Rooney and Robin Van Persie have started . Shock: West Brom turned up at United in September and won thanks to Saido Berahino . On the floor: The grounded Chris Smalling watches on as Adam Lallana scored for Southampton in October . David Moyes fears he will miss out on targets during this transfer window - click here to find out why. It is claimed that Van Persie was not happy with the new training methods implemented by Moyes when he took charge. Moyes is known to prefer short, sharp sessions, described as 'so hard' by Rooney. After years of persistent injury problems Van Persie went on a run of 90 consecutive league matches, at both Arsenal and United. That was ended when Moyes took over. Moyes has come under heavy criticism for his style of training, being branded 'prehistoric' by one Dutch football coach. Down and out? Rio Ferdinand limped off against Swansea and is considering retirement after many injuries . Has training been a factor in the injuries that have hampered United this season? Along with Van Persie they are currently missing Fellaini with a wrist injury, Phil Jones out with a knee problem, Nani's hamstring has gone and Rafael has a strained his groin. Ferdinand limped off the pitch against Swansea, Rooney is struggling with a groin injury and Ashley Young damaged his shoulder against Tottenham. Manchester United are one of the biggest brands on the planet, but that does not make them invincible. Their financial forecasts for investors are all based on reaching the quarter-finals of each cup and finishing third in the Premier League. Failure to achieve any of those targets – as is becoming increasingly likely – and next summer's transfer budget could be significantly smaller.","Manchester United are struggling to finish in the top four and out of FA Cup .

The family of an Ohio man fatally shot earlier this month while hunting is asking the killer to come forward after the sheriff's office received a mysterious letter from someone apologizing for the death. Iraq War veteran Larry Bradley, 45, was shot on December 2, the first day of deer hunting season, in rural Gallia County, Ohio.Sheriff's deputies weren't sure who shot Bradley when they found his body, but got a clue around Christmastime when a letter arrived at the office from an anonymous writer claiming responsibility. 'I am so sorry for the hurt and pain that I caused on that day can u please tell the family I am so sorry,' the letter said. But saying sorry on paper isn't enough for Mr Bradley's wife Denise, who wants legal justice for her husband . No return address: Larry Bradley, 45, was killed on December 2 while deer hunting in rural Ohio. He was shot to death with a gun that wasn't his and now someone has written an anonymous letter claiming responsibility for the death . Confession: Around Christmas, the sheriff's office received this letter from a man claiming to be Mr Bradley's killer . 'I know accidents can happen, but when they’re this big, you take responsibility for it,' she said. 'A letter doesn’t cut it.' Mrs Bradley spoke about her husband at a press conference earlier this week in hopes of coaxing the killer to come forward. The last thing Mr Bradley did was call his wife . Denise, asking for help. She received the call at 8:23 am, while still . sleeping in bed at their Bidwell home. In the five minute call she heard her husband husband struggling and thought he was having a heart attack. 'I said, ""What's wrong?"" Mrs Bradley recalled. 'He said, ""You just have to help me.""' She heard him choking and then silence. When authorities reached Mr Bradley, he was 18 feet above ground in a tree stand. He had been shot, but not with his own gun. The wound went through his rib cage and passed out of his body. They say he died in just minutes. Gallia County Sheriff Joe Browning decided to release part of the letter in hopes that the person responsible will come forward and admit to his actions. 'A letter doesn't cut it': Mr Bradley's wife Denise spoke to press earlier this week, in an attempt to coax the killer to come forward and face justice for his actions . 'They were having a hard time with this themselves,' Sheriff Browning said. 'This is the right thing to do.' Mrs Bradley also spoke about her husband before his tragic death. The divorced mother of two girls married Mr Bradley in 2003 and they had their first child together, daughter Riley, just 10 days before he shipped off to Iraq. In addition to serving in Iraq, Mr Bradley served two tours in Desert Shield/Desert Storm. When he returned Riley was almost a year old and they had another child, son Colton, the following summer. Their children are now 8 and 7, and life hasn't been easy without their father. 'Riley said she was glad Daddy got to spend Christmas with Jesus this year,' Mrs Bradley said. She says that while God will forgive killing her husband, it won't happen unless the person who did it takes responsibility.","Iraq War veteran Larry Bradley, 45, was fatally shot on December 2 while deer hunting in rural Ohio .

He was later pronounced dead at the hospital . While she was gone she heard a loud noise, ran back into the bathroom and found the boy had fallen into the empty bathtub. Paramedics rushed the boy to St Luke's Hospital on Roosevelt Island where he was pronounced dead. Police sources told NBC New York that the boy had been found with cuts and burns on his face, burns on his genitals, as well as yellow foam around his mouth. Some of the burns were from cigarettes and the babysitter couldn't account for any of the injuries. Wasn't watching: The boy's 37-year-old babysitter says she left the bathroom momentarily and came back to find the boy had fallen into the bathtub . She said the boy's 37-year-old father had placed him in her care on December 18 before being arrested on a warrant in New Jersey. He is still incarcerated. It was not immediately clear where the mother was, but according to the New York Daily News, she had lost custody. As of late Wednesday, the babysitter was still being questioned by police. The medical examiner is expected to conduct an autopsy Thursday morning, and charges will be filed after that. However, as the New York Times points out, these investigations can take a while. Charges have yet to be filed in the suspicious death of a Mexican consular official's 4-month-old son on December 10 after an autopsy proved inconclusive. The Administration of Children's Services is also investigating, and isn't allowed to divulge whether the family has a record. Sources told NBC New York that the babysitter doesn't have a history of child abuse or neglect. The child's death came as a surprise for tenants in the 40-story luxury tower.

Health service experts have sought to . debunk some of the hundreds of diets people pay to use every New Year, claiming some are dangerous and have no scientific or nutritional credence. Their free week-by-week programme cuts 600kcal from the daily intake of men and women to help them lose around 2lb every week.

A care home worker was jailed today for taking humiliating and degrading photographs of vulnerable elderly residents 'for a laugh'. Laquiesha Beatty, 22, used her mobile phone to take upsetting images of five women, who were in the advanced stages of dementia. The images - taken at Oak View care home in Hayling Island, Hampshire - included one of a patient tipped back in a wheelchair in a 'wheelie' position. Others showed two women in bed together, a patient in a bath with her breasts exposed, and another wearing designer sunglasses. Abuser: Laquiesha Beatty, 22, used her position at Oak View care home in Hayling Island (pictured) to take upsetting images of five women, who were in the advanced stages of dementia . Portsmouth Crown Court heard the women would not have been able to get themselves into these positions unaided. All five victims required 24-hour care because of their deteriorating mental and physical health. Beatty - who secured a job in a strip club after being dismissed from the care home - shouted 'I want my dad', as she was jailed for three months. Fellow care home worker William Bramwell, 26, was also charged in relation to two of the victims. Prosecutor Rob Welling said: 'What is clear in this case is that these two defendants utterly abused the trust placed with them by the family members.' The events were exposed when a photo was sent to someone who called police, the court heard. All staff were ordered to hand in their mobile phones which prompted an admission from Beatty. She accepted she had taken offensive photos of human waste before sending them to father-of-four Bramwell, with whom she 'had a laugh'. In one of the photos, Bramwell is pictured on a bed with one of the patients who looks shocked and upset. Bramwell was also photographed next to a victim with her underwear pulled down to her thighs. She was crying. She also photographed another woman on the toilet with another victim in front of her. Beatty admitted taking a photo of a man's medical records which contained photos of a sore on his bottom. Mr Welling said: 'The sense of betrayal is palpable. 'The victims are not just those who are residents but those who have had to accept what happened to their loved ones.' Reaction: Beatty screamed: 'I don't understand!' and 'I want my dad!' as she was jailed for three months for her crimes at Portsmouth Crown Court . He said a relative of one of the victims had treated Beatty with kindness because his mother had been in the care home for so many years. But the man has had to have counselling to try and overcome the guilt he feels at leaving his mother in Beatty's care. Hannah Wyatt, defending Beatty, said her client accepted she had been 'stupid'. 'Her actions were those of an incredibly immature and stupid young girl,' she said. The court heard Beatty had recently got a job in the Elegance strip club in Southsea and was 'terrified' by the thought of prison. Judge Sarah Munro described the case as 'distressing, to say the least and had no choice but to jail Beatty, from Hayling Island,  who admitted five counts of ill treatment/wilful neglect of a person without capacity against five different women. She also admitted knowingly or recklessly . obtaining, disclosing, or procuring personal information of a patient . from another care home. When her sentence was announced Beatty . screamed: 'I don't understand!' She stood up and held her hands out, . shouting 'I want my dad!' before she was taken to the cells.

The attorney for the boy, 16, filed court papers at the end of December that state that Lawrence and Sheila Pott share responsibility for their daughter's death in September 2012. The teenager killed herself after three classmates allegedly sexually assaulted her and circulated photos of the sickening attack. Pott, from Saratoga, California, took her life in after sending Facebook messages to the boys who allegedly assaulted her at an alcohol-fueled party. Now one of the boys is stating that her parents have partial responsibility in the case, as reported by SFGate.com. The document, filed by attorney Philip Pereira, says that Lawrence and Sheila Pott failed to act on the girl's 'long-standing and serious emotional problems before her suicide and they should have sought professional help.' The filing also mentions an 'altercation' between Audrie and two of her friends shortly before her death. Robert Allard, the parents' attorney reacted angrily to the assertions. He released a statement reading: 'The sole issue in this case is the callous behavior of the . suspects which directly led to Audrie's unnecessary death. 'Since this . lawsuit was filed, it has become quite clear to us that the suspects . refuse to accept responsibility or show remorse for their actions.' Heartbroken: Larry Pott and Audrie's stepmother Lisa believe that the bullying at school led to the tragedy. Now one of the accused boys claims they are partly to blame . SFGate.com reported that Allard described the document as 'a revolting attempt to deflect . responsibility away from his clients. This case is and will always be . about the tragic consequences associated with sexual assault and cyber . bullying.' Three boys who attended Saratoga high school with Pott have been charged in juvenile court and also face a wrongful death lawsuit from the girl's parents. Pott desperately pleaded with the boys to delete the images in the days before her death, has emerged last year. Cruel: Pott, right, was allegedly assaulted after a night of drinking  and boys spread photos of the attack .

Another male classmate responded: 'lol that s*** gets around haha everyone knows mostly everything hahaah.' Pott . was found hanging in the bathroom of her mother's home on September 12, . 2012 after the explicit photographs had allegedly led to bullying at . school. Her devastated . parents blame her death on the horrific sexual attack a week earlier at . the hands of three teenage boys who then allegedly tried to cover up . their involvement. On . the night of the attack, a group of teenagers were at a friend's house . drinking heavily. The girl who lived at the house threw the party when . her parents left town. Three male classmates allegedly . helped an inebriated Audrie to a bedroom before stripping her naked, drawing over her . body and sexually assaulting her. Grieving: Audrie's mother, Sheila Pott, found her daughter hanging in the bathroom in September 2012 . Audrie Pott wrote a series of desperate Facebook messages before her death that have been excerpted in Rolling Stone. In one exchange, she speaks to one of her alleged attackers: . AUDRIE: i need to talk to u. BOY: What . AUDRIE: one word... marker . BOY: What about marker . AUDRIE: u know what im talking about... i dont remeber anything about that... [A friend] had to tell me everything... i swear to god if u still have those pictures illl killl u . BOY: They are deleted and I didn't take them I promise it wasn't me...

I now have a reputation I can never get rid of. AUDRIE: My life is over... I ruined my life and I don't even remember how. Source: Rolling Stone magazine . In police interviews, the teenagers admitted . to coloring half of her face black with marker, then . pulling down her bra, taking off her shorts and drawing on her breasts and near her genitals. They . allegedly photographed themselves sexually assaulting her and, by the . time she started her sophomore year at Saratoga High School two days . later, scores of students had seen the images. Rolling Stone magazine has . revealed the torment Audrie suffered in the days before her death and . has detailed the messages she exchanged with her alleged attackers, whom . she had known since middle school. She messaged one boy, vowing to kill him if he still had the images. 'They are deleted and I didn't take them,' he wrote. 'I promise it wasn't me.' 'I'm sorry about the marker,' he added of the drawings that covered her body. She also messaged another boy who had been at the party to ask if one of the teenagers had photographs of her. 'ur fine,' he responded. 'ill make sure nothing goes around.' She replied: 'It's gonna get out. S*** always does. Especially with the people who were there.' And in an even more concerning exchange, one of her classmates sent her a message reading: 'lol that s*** gets around haha everyone knows mostly everything hahaah.' 'My life is over... I ruined my life and I don't even remember how,' one of her final messages read. 'You have no idea what it's like to be a girl.' When she returned to school, she missed classes to avoid people and had an argument with one of her closest friends, Kathy Atabakhsh, who accused her of becoming a different person. 'She had been, literally, the best person . you could meet – always honest and trustworthy,' Kathy told Rolling Stone. 'And I was so upset that she had . changed. It was hard for her to hear that from a close friend.' Another girl loudly pointed out in class that Audrie had been cutting herself, and the teenager burst out crying. She told friends she had cut herself on a vase.","Audrie Pott, 15, hanged herself in September 2012 'after images were passed around school showing her naked and being sexually assaulted'

Postmen often have to keep an eye out for aggressive dogs while trying to make their deliveries. But rather than a hound, it was a large spider that stopped letters being delivered to the home of Stuart Robertson-Reed. Instead of a cheque the business analyst was waiting for, he found a note written by a scared postman which read: 'No access - massive spider web in front gate'. Failed delivery: Mr Robertson-Reid eventually received his letter when it was delivered by the postman's colleague - who had written 'WHAT!' on the post . According to Mr Roberston-Reed the 'massive spider' was the size of a 10p coin. The 42-year-old said he had noticed the animal by the side of his front gate - but had left it be to avoid breaking the web. Mr Robertson-Reed said: 'I couldn't believe it. He was either spider-friendly and didn't want to break the web or a terrified arachnophobe.' After a night away, Stuart found his mail had been delivered to his home in Clapham, South London, by another, less scared, postman. Fear: The business analyst said the spider, which spun its web on the front gate of his Clapham home, pictured, was no bigger than a 10p coin . Rather comically, the braver postman had added his own comment to his colleague's note which said: 'WHAT!' Today, Royal Mail apologised for any inconvenience Mr Roberston-Reed had suffered and added: 'Alternative arrangements should have been made.' An expert has confirmed that this arachnid is a common garden spider - and not one of thousands of poisonous spiders currently plaguing Britain. Greg Hitchcock of Kent Wildlife Trust said: 'This is a Common garden spider, Araneus diadematus. '[They are] common and widespread. Very noticeable this time of year as the large females are at their biggest and sitting in the middle of their webs.' The postman is not the first - and probably won't be the last - to refuse to make a delivery. Heather Rogers, 63, did not receive regular mail deliveries for months because pigeon droppings made it too slippery for postal staff to deliver to her home. The animals would gather on top of a wall close to her Cornwall home and regularly splatter the path with droppings. Apology: Royal Mail have today said that alternative arrangements should have been made so that Mr Robertson-Reed's letter was delivered regardless of the spider, pictured . At the time, a Royal Mail spokesman said: 'We suspended delivery to two addresses in October 2012, because the postman delivering there reported broken glass and a slippery, slimy surface  on the path in the narrow alleyway. 'We informed the customers of the suspension and told them we would be contacting the local authority to request cleaning work be carried out in the alleyway.' In February, residents of 90 homes in Salford were sent a letter warning them their post has been temporarily suspended for health and safety reasons after two postmen were confronted by one dog. Mr Robertson-Reed is not the first to experience a late delivery. Heather Rogers, 63, did not receive . regular mail deliveries for a month because pigeon droppings made it too . slippery for postal staff to reach her home in Cornwall. Once the mess was cleared three weeks later, the service resumed. Overzealous Royal Mail health and safety officers ruled in November last year that the uneven paving slabs on two roads in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, were too dangerous for their postmen to negotiate. The residents had to make a six-mile round trip to a local delivery office to collect their post - and were told to speak to the Land Registry about the issue. Royal Mail suspended deliveries to one street in Elgin, northern Scotland, after a flock of unfriendly seagulls launched a series of 'swooping attacks' on one postman. The organisation said at the time they would resume their service 'as soon as it was safe to do so.' Around 90 residents of a Salford, Manchester, estate were sent a letter by Royal Mail warning them their post had been suspended temporarily because of an aggressive dog.","Rather than a cheque he was expecting, Stuart Robertson-Reed found a note which read: 'No access - massive spider web in front gate'

A quarter of television viewers now watch their favourite programmes using catch-up services, it has been revealed, after the recent episode of Sherlock picked up an extra 3.5 million viewers through BBC iPlayer in the days after it was first broadcast. Sherlock now has the highest post-broadcast viewing figures of all time, overtaking the 2011 Downton Abbey Christmas special, which received 3.1 million views through ITV Player. When total viewing figures are analysed, roughly a third of those who watch a programme will now do so through an online catch-up service or or through their television's recording device. Play it again: Sherlock now has the highest post-broadcast viewing figures of all time. One theory on why 'cult' dramas perform so well on catch-up services is because fans re-watch the same episode multiple times . The New Year's Day episode of Sherlock was criticised for failing to answer questions about how the world's most famous detective faked his own death in the final episode of the previous series. But that didn't stop it attracting over 10 million viewers during its initial broadcast, raising to 13 million when catch-up services are factored in. The popularity of catch-up services has been attributed to changing lifestyle habits, with people often choosing to use mobile phones or tablets to watch programmes on the move, rather than at home. Now that services such as BBC's iPlayer, ITV Player and Channel 4's 40D are available as standard on the majority new television sets, the practice of the entire country settling down to watch a programme at the same time is increasingly unrealistic. Top ratings: Downton Abbey's 2011 Christmas special received 3.1 million views through ITV Player. The 2012 version was almost as popular on the catch-up service, bringing in an extra 2.76 million viewers . High ratings: The 2012 Christmas Eve special of BBC comedy Mrs Brown's Boys attracted 2.89 million viewers via catch-up, with a further 2.75million watching an episode from February 4 2013 . Many of the programmes with high post-broadcast viewing figures are so-called 'cult' dramas, such as Doctor Who and the aforementioned Sherlock. Although these programmes are incredibly popular and therefore naturally attract a large numbers of views, it is thought that their fans also tend to watch them during their initial broadcast, then re-watch one or more times through a catch-up service. Contender: Doctor Who's 50th anniversary special attracted an extra 2.62 million viewers on iPlayer . Speaking to the Telegraph: Charlotte . Moore, the controller of BBC One, said: 'I'm very proud to have Sherlock . on BBC One and see it topping the charts as the biggest consolidated . audience ever. It demonstrates that ambition and quality matter to our . audience.' Of the all time top 10 most watched programmes on a catch-up service, seven are programmes that first appeared on the BBC. Behind Sherlock and Downtown Abbey, the 2012 Call the Midlife Christmas Special is in third place attracting a total of 2.92 additional viewers and 10.1million overall. The 2012 Christmas Eve special of BBC comedy Mrs Brown's Boys attracted 2.89 million catch-up viewers, with a further 2.75million . watching an episode from February 4 2013. Although the 2011 episode of Downtown Abbey sits in second place, the 2012 version was almost as popular bringing in 2.76 million catch-up viewers, taking its total to 10.3 million. A surprise entry in the top 10 is the BBC's Boxing Day episode of Still Open All Hours, starring David Jason. The 2013 remake of the classic 70s sitcom had its viewing figures pushed up from 9.57million to 12.23 million by catch–up. Somewhat less surprising entries were Doctor Who's 50th anniversary special, which attracted an extra 2.62 million viewers on iPlayer - taking the total to 12.8 million, and acclaimed dram Broadchurch, which was watched an additional 2.45million times after first being shown. Lord Hall of Birkenhead, the BBC's director-general has previously stated that he says catch-up services as the future of television and radio. Still attracting fans: A surprise entry in the top 10 is the BBC's Boxing Day episode of Still Open All Hours, starring David Jason. The 2013 remake of the classic 70s sitcom had total viewing figures of 12.23 million . Speaking about his plans for the BBC late last year, he said: 'No listener or viewer should ever have to feel a sense of powerless frustration that the BBC they want has succumbed to a BBC they didn't ask for, because in future individuals will have the ability to control the BBC themselves.' He added: 'The BBC you can have is catching up with the BBC you want; there's a fundamental shift happening.'","Sherlock now has the highest post-broadcast viewing figures of all time .

Estate agents have warned of the huge impact continued flooding of multi-million pound homes may have on some of the country's most expensive property markets. Houses in the so-called 'stockbroker belt' along the River Thames suffered as flood waters have spilled into basements, ground floors and gardens today. Exclusive addresses in Marlow and Cookham, Buckinghamshire, which count Heston Blumenthal, Sir Clive Woodward and Andrew Strauss among residents, were submerged leaving residents counting the immediate costs of insurance claims and repairing damage. Andrew Milsom, director of Andrew Milson Estate Agents, warned that flooding could pose ongoing problems for the area's housing market. 'If a property has flooded in the past and the owners have needed to make an insurance claim, it does cause concern to people looking to buy,' he said. 'Insurance companies are becoming increasingly difficult - we sold a riverside property in Temple over the summer and the buyer went to 96 insurance companoes. Of those, less than 10 were viable and affordable quotes.' He added that potential buyers would rule out properties without viewing them, if their postcode was classed as in an area at risk of flooding, regardless of its individual siting. 'They can make that decision from their home before they bother stepping through the door,' said Mr Milsom. A £3.75 million home in Quarry Wood Road, Marlow, flooded today. Warning: Earlier in the day the magician tweeted advising neighbours to 'get inflatable paddling pools downstairs and dump everything you can into them' Peter Nicholls, director of Jacksons estate agents which is advertising the property, gave a more positive outlook. 'For some reason people buying a property next to the river are always surprised when the insurance company tells them it is on a flood plain,' he said. 'This has been quite a bad year as we have had a lot of rain, but with most properties the garden will flood and it is inconvenient but not too much of a problem.

Controversial plans to attract wealthy investors would amount to letting them buy a British passport, critics claim . Foreign millionaires will be able to ‘buy’ visas to live in Britain under radical plans drawn up by government advisers. Migration Advisory Committee suggests people who give money to schools, universities or hospitals should be ‘let in’ to the UK. It also proposes holding auctions for visas to be sold to the highest overseas bidder, but MPs warn the plan would bring ‘no benefit to the citizens of this country’. The plan is likely to prove highly controversial, because the Home Office has previously opposed plans by other EU countries to effectively sell citizenship which would give them the right to settle in Britain. Professor Sir David Metcalf, chairman of the MAC, told MPs that Britain had to examine new ways to attract wealthy investors to the country. He said: ‘It may very well be that we should be auctioning some of these slots/ . ‘There should be proper discussion about it. Equally it may very well be that we should be letting people in if they endow a Cambridge college, a major teaching hospital or the London School of Economics with £10 million.’ The committee has been asked to examine the issue by Home Secretary Theresa May, and is expected to submit a report in February. But giving evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee, Sir David set out how an auction might work. One option would see wealthy foreigners making investments of £1million, £5million or £10million in government bonds or UK businesses. In return, the investor would be able to apply to stay in the UK for two, three or five years and after that could apply for UK citizenship. The gilts could later be sold, meaning the money is effectively a loan and not a long-term investment. Sir . David said the country did not ‘need’ the money. ‘Sometimes they borrow . the money and then they keep the gilts for five years. They get . indefinite leave to remain, and then they sell them. We do not need . their money.’ Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee, said the proposal had triggered real concern among MPs . But Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs committee, was alarmed by the idea and suggested the plan would allow people to obtain a Brititish passport without benefiting the country. He told The Times: ‘‘What was very clear from David Metcalf and what causes us concern is that this is not a way of getting money into Britain to produce more jobs and ensure the economy benefits,’ he said. ‘This is a way in which those who have money available to buy gilts, get citizenship and then sell them at personal gain. There is no benefit to the citizens of this country. ‘The whole area around the investor route towards citizenship needs to be examined. We need to have a better way. At the moment the route ensures benefits to individuals but not society as a whole.’ Sir Andrew Green, chairman of MigrationWatch UK, said: ‘It would be absurd if this route was allowed to become a means of selling British passports.’ Malta sparked controversy when it announced plans to sell passports for half a million pounds. The . policy will allow the super-rich from countries like Russia and China . to effectively buy the right to live and work anywhere in the EU. The . Home Office warned at the time that it would not tolerate ‘abuse’ of free movement rules . across the EU and is working to prevent people using loopholes to enter . the UK.","Migration Advisory Committee reveals controversial plan to MPs .

'Idiot': Culture Secretary Maria Miller was accused of doing nothing to involve the rest of the Empire during the 100th anniversary celebrations . Culture Secretary Maria Miller was branded an ‘idiot’ last night amid claims that the commemoration of the First World War will ignore key British allies. In the latest in a series of rows over the commemorations, allies of Education Secretary Michael Gove expressed concern that the 100th anniversary events will include no special mention of the role played by Britain’s allies in Australia and New Zealand. Plans have been drawn up to honour soldiers from ‘New Commonwealth’ countries like Pakistan, Bangladesh and India - in order to inspire schoolchildren whose families originated in those countries. But Australian officials have expressed concern that ANZAC soldiers who fought and died at Gallipoli and in the fields of Flanders will be overlooked. A senior Whitehall source told the Mail: ‘This is awful - the idiot Maria Miller is doing nothing to involve the rest of the Empire, who sent vast numbers of people to help us. ‘The DCMS [Department of Culture Media and Sport] say they don’t want too much focus on death!’ In an article for the Mail last week, Mr Gove delivered a coded criticism of the commemoration plans drawn up by Mrs Miller, saying there should be greater emphasis on how Germany was to blame for the conflict. He also denounced ‘left-wing myths’ about the war as a ‘shambles’ peddled by Blackadder and other programmes. Allies of Mr Gove blamed Mrs Miller earlier this week after Cabinet sources were quoted saying that the Education Secretary should ‘get back in his box’ and stay out of the debate. The extraordinary spat took another turn last night following claims in Australia that the role of the ANZACs is being ‘whitewashed’ by the Department of Culture. Casualties: 62,000 Australians died in the Great War but there are fears there will be no mention of them . 62,000 Australians died in the Great War but an Australian official quoted in The Australian newspaper said that documents circulated on the commemorations have ignored the ANZACS. ‘There has been no mention of old Commonwealth Allies like Australia or New Zealand but more interest in celebrating the role from New Commonwealth countries,’ the source said. ‘I think it’s fair to say Commonwealth ties are being frayed a little on this one.’ A source close to Mrs Miller hit back, dismissing the complaints in Australia as unfounded and branding the criticism from within Whitehall as ‘petty and childish’. ‘Not only is this complete nonsense with no understanding of our WW1 centenary plans, but such petty and childish comments have no place in government,’ the DCMS source said. Remembrance: Australian and New Zealand soldiers gathered at Hyde Park Corner to commemorate the 93rd anniversary of the Gallipoli landing which claimed more than 130,000 lives during World War I . ‘We are consistently delivering complicated Government policy effectively and would suggest others focus on doing the same.’ A Culture Department spokesman said: ‘The UK will be commemorating the huge contribution and sacrifices made by members of Armed Forces from Britain, Australia, New Zealand and other Commonwealth countries and Allies in a wide range of centenary events throughout the 2014-2018 period. ‘Helen Grant, Minister with responsibility for the First World War commemorations recently met the High Commissioners from New Zealand and Australia to discuss our plans. ‘We are clear that Britain could not have prevailed without the contribution of our Commonwealth partners and our plans for the centenary will fully reflect that.’","Tory minister accused of doing nothing to involve the rest of the Empire .

A jobless man who claimed to have fathered 22 children by 11 women was yesterday spared jail for dealing drugs – after telling a judge he needed to help care for his youngest. Raymond Hull, 58, who has been married only once and has lived off benefits for a decade, insisted ‘I just love kids’, but admitted he was in contact with only ‘about 12’ of them. Despite police finding a stash of cannabis and text messages from customers, a judge accepted he was helping to raise child number 22 – seven-month-old Barry – while his partner returned to work. 'I just love kids': Raymond Hull, who was spared jail for dealing drugs, with his 22nd and youngest child Barry . With ‘considerable hesitation’ the judge went on to impose a suspended sentence. Afterwards . Hull – who has a series of convictions dating back four decades – . defended his unconventional lifestyle, saying he had ‘never been short . of offers’. ‘I just love kids,’ he said. ‘I don’t regret anything, . even though I don’t speak to them all. Some of them don’t even know I’m . their dad.’ And he bragged: ‘I don’t know what it is about me, but I’m . never short of offers. Raymond Hull narrowly missed time behind bars when his 18-month jail sentence was suspended to allow him to care for his youngest son Barry . ‘It’s just my luck that every time I have a one-night stand, the girl ends up getting pregnant. 'I've never had to chase after women. I'm easy going, they are always chasing me.'If it's tidy, you don't knock it back, do you?' Hull . claims to have fathered his first child when he was 16, but according . to local birth records his eldest, John, was born when he was 19. Later . that year, in 1975, he married John’s mother, Patricia, then just 17, . and over the next nine years they had four more children – Raymond Jr, . now 37, Joseph, 36, Adrian, 34, and Rebecca, 29. ‘I only know one or . two of  their birthdays, but they don’t mind. One of the girls got a . sister for her birthday one year,’ he recalled yesterday. The couple . split up and Hull is listed as the father of three children – Leon, now . 23, Rianna, 22, and Kane, 20 – by his next partner. Two years ago he . set up home in the Cumbrian village of Aspatria with a bakery worker . less than half his age, 26-year-old Emma McNeil, and last year she gave . birth to a baby boy, Barry. However, when he appeared in court this week . he claimed to have fathered a total of 22 children. Explaining how . he fathered so many children by so many women, he said yesterday: ‘I’ve . only been married once. I’ve got five kids with one woman; three with . another; three with another; and three with another. I’ve got two kids . with one woman and little Barry with Emma. ‘The others were just one each with different women. 'Some of the girls were happy to give the . relationship a go, others did not want anything to do with me after . they got pregnant. I still keep in touch with all the women now though. I . get on better with them now we've split. 'I . agreed with some of my exes now that if they get married to someone . else, and another man raises the kid, it is not my kid anymore. I see 14 . of my kids who know I am their dad all the time'. Hull hasn’t worked for ten years because of a bad back and says 'it must be from running round after all these kids all these years'.

Workers who retire this year will be an average of £3,000 a year worse off than their friends, family and colleagues who retired at the start of the financial crisis, a report reveals today. The so-called ‘Class of 2014’ - those who plan to retire over the next 12 months - typically expect to receive £15,800 a year. But this is £2,900 less a year, equal to £8 a day, than people who retired in 2008, the year that the recession began but before it had wreaked havoc on people’s retirement plans. Workers who retire this year will be an average of £3,000 a year worse off than their friends, family and colleagues who retired at the start of the financial crisis, a report reveals today. Posed by models . Crucially, the ‘Class of 2008’ retired before the Bank of England decided to cut the base rate to an historic low of 0.5 per cent, the lowest level in its 320-year history. Yesterday - for the 58th consecutive month - the Bank’s interest rate setting committee voted to keep the base rate frozen at this level. The decision was made in March 2009 in a move which has crippled people’s savings with interest rates paid by banks and building societies on their nest eggs close to zero. It is the longest period during which the Bank has decided not to raise interest rates since the aftermath of the Second World War when it was stuck at 2 per cent for 12 years. To make matters worse, the true impact on people retiring today is even worse if the figures are adjusted to take into account the crippling increase in the cost of living. Region Annual retirement income* . London: £18,400 Scotland: £17,800 South East: £16,500 Eastern: £15,800 East Midlands: £15,500 West Midlands: £15,300 Yorkshire & The Humber: £15,100 North West: £14,700 South West: £14,000 North East: £13,900 UK: £15,800 . * As predicted by people planning to retire this year Source: Prudential . Since 2008, prices have risen by nearly 20 per cent, according to the report from the insurance giant, Prudential. While the ‘Class of 2008’ retired with an average income of £18,700 a year, a person retiring this year would need an annual income of £22,400 to have the same spending power. Vince Smith-Hughes, a retirement expert from the Prudential, said: ‘Inflation is eroding pensioners’ spending power in real terms.’ For millions of pensioners, the main problem is that they might have saved as much money in their pension pot - but get much less money when they use it to buy an annuity, an income for life. In January 2008, a 65-year-old man cashing in his £100,000 pension pot would have received an annual income for life of £7,341. Today a man with the same pot of money would get only £6,099 a year, a drop of 17 per cent, according to the financial advisers Hargreaves Lansdown. Simon Rose, from the campaign group Save our Savers, said: ‘Throughout the crisis, the Bank has shown utter contempt for the effect of their policies on savers and pensioners. ‘What they view as economic theory is lifetime hardship for many people at the most difficult time of their life.’ The report, based on interviews with 7,821 people aged 45 and over, including 1,010 who plan to retire this year, asked people how much they expect to receive every year when they retire. Income from their State pension, any other pension, such as a company pension, and their savings were included. Other types of income, such as money from a buy-to-let property or earnings from a part-time job, were excluded. The report reveals significant regional differences, with the best-off pensioners in London getting £18,400 a year compared to the worst-off in the North East on only £13,900 a year.","'Class of 2014' typically expect to receive £15,800 a year .

Dr Abhijit Banerjee denied conducting an intimate chest examination, which was sexually motivated. He was later cleared. Pictured arriving at a tribunal hearing in Manchester . A GP has been cleared of groping a patient's breast after a tribunal found the woman's evidence was unreliable. The 42-year-old woman claimed Dr Abhijit Banerjee locked the consultation room door and asked her to remove her bra while she sat on the couch. Known only as Patient A, she claimed that the senior partner at the Abbeyview Surgery, in Peterborough, Cambs, had knelt on the floor while he cupped and squeezed her breast as he breathed 'erratically'. The General Medical Council accused the married father-of-two of 'sexually motivated conduct' but the GP was vindicated when the fitness to practise found Patient A's evidence to be unreliable. Patient A, had a history of chest problems and had consulted Dr Banerjee for a 'thorough' chest examination presenting with an ongoing cough, the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service was told. The 42-year-old doctor had admitted to not providing a screen to protect the patient's privacy during consultation on March 13, 2012, but the panel found this did not amount to misconduct. Despite undergoing more than 60 similar appointments because of her particular medical history she told the Manchester hearing this time it 'just felt wrong' at the hands of Dr Banerjee. Giving evidence, she said: 'It was an examination like I had never had before. I felt very upset. 'The position of me sitting on the couch with the doctor on his knees, and I could only see the top of his head, while holding my breast, just felt wrong,' she added. 'He was not squeezing continuously. He held my breast in a manner where he was covering my breast. 'It felt uncomfortable to be held covering the nipple area especially.' The hearing was told that Patient A reported the incident after discussing what had happened with a friend at 'the Bingo' later that day, but did not make an official complaint until two months later. The Indian-trained medic, who qualified in Calcutta in 1996, denied any wrongdoing in his treatment of the woman throughout the hearing. He said the examination was justified and that it his usual practice to kneel down during a breast check if the patient is sat on the low chair in his consultation room. Patient A claimed Dr Banerjee locked the consulting room door At Abbeyview Surgery in Peterborough, before asking her to remove her bra while he examined her chest. Her evidence was found to be unreliable . The medic argued his unusual breathing . may have been to demonstrate the long, deep breaths his patient needed . to take while she was being examined. Following . an application to drop the charges, the panel, chaired by John . Donnelly, decided that there were too many questions over the . reliability of Patient A's evidence. Mr . Donnelly told the doctor: 'The panel considered that she gave what she . believed was a truthful account of what happened during your examination . of her chest. 'The panel however, cannot find that she is not mistaken or has not misinterpreted innocent actions by you. 'The . panel find that there are too many question marks surrounding patient . A's overall credibility for it to put reliance on her evidence which is . uncorroborated.'

US intelligence officers feared that terrorists would create an online avatar of Osama Bin Laden to continue to preach the late Al Qaeda leader’s message for centuries. A study predicted that jihadists would use images and recordings of Bin Laden to put together new speeches and fatwas which would be broadcast online even after his death. Its theories also included terrorists infiltrating virtual reality worlds such as Second Life or online role-playing games such as World of Warcraft to recruit new members. Fearing a fake: A 2008 report by US intelligence officers ponder that terrorists would create an online avatar of bin Laden by putting together and rehashing old images and speeches . The report was written for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in 2008, but had not been released to the public until this week. It concludes that it is ‘likely’ that virtual worlds would be used to spread propaganda, train new members, and even find prospects, but that there was little evidence of such activities at the time of writing. ‘Imagine that jihadist supporters create a detailed avatar of Usama bin Ladin and use his many voice recordings to animate the avatar for up-close virtual reality experiences that could be used to preach, convert, recruit, and propagate dogma to the media,’ the confidential study says. ‘The Bin Laden avatar could preach and issue new fatwas for hundreds of years to come, as the fidelity of his likeness would be entirely believable and animated in new ways to keep him current and fresh.’ Fantasy theories: The study predicted that jihadists would use role-playing games such as World of Warcraft to recruit new members and spread propaganda . 'As of this report, there is little evidence that militant Islamist and jihadist groups have begun extensively exploiting the opportunities presented by virtual worlds. 'However, [...] they will likely soon seek to exploit newer virtual world technologies for recruiting, raising and transferring funds, training new recruits, conducting reconnaissance and surveillance, and planning attacks by using virtual representations of prospective targets.' The 142-page study, titled '3D Cyberspace Spillover: Where Virtual Worlds Get Real', was published by Steven Aftergood, a secrecy expert and researcher for the Federation of American Scientists, who obtained it through a Freedom of Information request. However, Aftergood told Mashable, that ‘the purpose of the study was to stimulate unconventional thinking’ which is why, he added, some theories can be seen as outlandish. Osama bin Laden was the founder of Al-Qaeda, the terrorist organisation behind the 9/11 attacks, and several other violent acts of terrorism. He was killed in May 2011 after he was tracked down by American intelligence in Abbottabad, Pakistan. A United States special forces military unit carried out Operation Neptune Spear, ordered by President Obama, and bin Laden was shot dead during the raid of his compound. The news of his death was welcomed across the world, however the US operation was condemned by the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas and the Taliban and pro-bin Laden rallies were held by Islamist groups in Pakistan, Sudan and Turkey.","Report from 2008 shows US intelligence feared a 'virtual Bin Laden'

A fugitive oligarch who accused Prince Andrew of accepting £15million worth of laundered money for his old family home was yesterday ordered out of France. Judges in Aix-en-Provence, in the south of the country, said Mukhtar Ablyazov, 50, should be extradited to Ukraine or Russia to face fraud charges. He was arrested in July following a raid by French special forces on his luxury rented villa near Nice after being accused of siphoning off billions from his home country of Kazakhstan. Fraud charge: Ablyazov is accused of having embezzled billions of dollars . As part of his defence at a London . trial, Ablyazov said Sunninghill Park, the 600-acre Berkshire estate . where Prince Andrew used to live with his ex-wife, the Duchess of York, . and their two daughters, was bought with suspicious funds from . Kazakhstan. At one stage, Ablyazov wanted to call Andrew as a defence . witness in court – something which would have caused the prince huge . embarrassment because of his role as Britain’s international trade . ambassador. Sunninghill was sold to Timur Kulibayev, the son-in-law . of the president of Kazakhstan, for £15million in 2007, despite having . been on the market for £3million less. Ablyazov said he had documents . which linked the purchase with the sell-off of a £110million stake in a . state-owned oil and gas company in Kazakhstan. There was no suggestion that Andrew would have known the source of the funds, and he did not appear in court. Ablyazov . is wanted in Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan on fraud charges worth . £3.6billion. He disappeared from Britain in February 2012 just before . being sentenced to 22-months in prison for contempt of court in a . financial fraud trial. Taken: Ablyazov's mansion in Hampstead, which has a 50ft ballroom and a Turkish bath, is one of several he bought in a spree financed allegedly using fake loans, backdated documents and offshore accounts . He was subsequently stripped of assets worth more than £150million in British assets. Armoured . vehicles and a military plane were used in the raid on Ablyazov’s French . home because he was known to have a ‘private militia’ at his disposal. Ukraine . wants him extradited to face charges over an alleged £100million scam . while he was chairman of the BTA Bank from 2005 to 2009. Mr Justice . Teare, sitting in London’s High Court last year, said Ablyazov was . accused of ‘fraud on an epic scale’ and had committed ‘deliberate and . substantial’ contempts by breaching an asset-freezing order imposed to . stop money vanishing. The conviction was upheld at the Court of . Appeal in November 2012, where Lord Justice Maurice Kay said Ablyazov . had shown ‘rare cynicism and deviousness’ as he fought the claims . against him. Yesterday Peter Sahlas, a lawyer for Ablyazov, said: . ‘This court wants to send Ablyazov, a refugee, straight to the very . people he should be protected from.’ The banker’s wife, Alma . Shalabayeva, added: ‘For my husband, extradition is a death sentence. If . he is extradited, he will never see me or our four children ever . again.’ But a spokesman for the BTA bank welcomed the French . decision, saying it ‘demonstrates once again that Mr Ablyazov’s repeated . attempts to portray himself as being pursued by the bank for political . reasons are groundless’.

A couple has been reunited with their baby nine months after she was taken into care by a council who accused her father of being a terrorist and tried to put her up for adoption. Misty Barnes was removed from her parents Cheryl Rich and Jack Barnes when she was one-month-old after social workers decided she was in danger. In adoption papers Mr Barnes, 39, said Thurrock Council in Essex called him a terrorist and a threat to national security, who had knowledge of making bombs and had threatened to blow up buildings. Reunited: Jack Barnes and Cheryl Rich with their daughter Misty Barnes, nine months after she was taken from them because a local council called him a terrorist . They also alleged he was a violent armed robber, who had served eight years inside Belmarsh Prison and had pumped his dogs with steroids so they could cage fight. Mr Barnes was jailed for arson and handling stolen goods when he was younger, and has also been convicted of growing cannabis. But he adamantly denies the claims made by the council and the couple have won a legal battle to get their child back. Misty's mother Cheryl, 26, said: 'I was upset, confused and scared when they took Misty away. 'We went back to the flat and broke down. But it's amazing to have her back in our lives now - it's been so hard.' Mr Barnes added: 'We have had to stay strong through this. The council tried to break us. 'I've had run-ins with the law before, and they were all a long time ago. 'I haven't got any convictions for violence. I would never hurt Cheryl or Misty.' He said being accused of being a terrorist was just 'ridiculous'. Accusations: Mr Barnes says the family are thrilled to have their daughter back. The 39-year-old has admitted he has been in jail before, but denies that he was a terrorist or domestic abuser . He added: 'I'm not perfect, but that was unbelievable. I think the council were looking for a reaction from me. 'I know how the legal system works and so I told Cheryl that we need to write everything down and keep all our evidence.' He added: 'The council hasn't apologised to us. Now we want a full inquiry to place.' Jackie . Doyle-Price, Tory MP for Thurrock, said the council was guilty of a . major injustice and owed the couple, of Grays, Essex, a huge apology. 'While . the family are reunited now, nothing can replace the time they have . lost. A major injustice has taken place her,' she said, adding: 'Thurrock council owe this family a huge apology.' In . addition to the false accusations, the council managed to mix Misty's . case up, putting the authority in breach of strict data protection . rules. Row: Thurrock Council has refused to discuss the case and says the couple should complain if they are aggrieved by their treatment . The couple's . solicitors were sent paperwork regarding the wrong child and a document was submitted to court by the council with the wrong child, . wrong sex and even the wrong local authority council listed on it. She . said: 'Whilst there were reasons to be concerned for Misty's welfare, . social workers treated Cheryl as a victim of domestic violence, which . she was not. 'The council argue the court would not have approved the first care order unless the action was fair. 'However, the papers filed with the court by the council contained untruths which Jack and Cheryl could not challenge.' The council refused to comment in detail on the case, but a spokesman said: 'The family has been asked to provide a detailed written complaint, setting out all their issues so it can be investigated properly by a non-council, independent person.'","Misty Barnes was taken from parents when she was one-month-old .

BNP leader Nick Griffin obviously thinks the way to the British public’s vote is through their stomachs. The MEP, who was last week declared bankrupt, is trying his hand as a TV chef promising recipes on how to cook ‘traditional British fare’ on his large Aga. In a bizarre 30-minute video, Mr Griffin swigs beer like Keith Floyd while imparting tips on how to chop an onion and why English food is the best in Europe. Scroll down for video . Recipe: BNP leader Nick Griffin has posted his cookery tips online for workers and their wives who do not know how to make cheap meals . Cooking a British stew certainly seemed to be thirsty work, with Mr Griffin taking swings from a pint glass and a bottle as he rattled the pots and pans . Mr Griffin claims he was given culinary inspiration after speaking at a public meeting where people warned of the impact of ‘poverty’ on their workmates. He warns that many people – more specifically ‘their wives’ - do not know how to cook cheap food so he offers a ‘recipe for beating the Tory blues’. But during the lengthy BNP video posted on YouTube, which includes a description of different sized potatoes and the merits of swede, he manages to make several political points about why all things English are best. Addressing the camera in what appears to be his own kitchen, he tells viewers: ‘One of our chaps in Birmingham was saying that people he works with were saying they simply cannot afford, their wives cannot afford to put enough decent food on the table. ‘He said part of the trouble of course is a lot of these people cannot cook. ‘So you can talk about producing cheap food and cooking for yourselves but really all they know is cheap packet food. ‘In those circumstances you simply cannot do cheap meals. You have to pay the top supermarket prices.' Tip: Among the many pieces of advice given by the BNP leader is the need to remove the skin from an onion before chopping . Patriotic: Mr Griffin chose British beef, but not the best cut and found two packets which were reduced in the supermarket . New career? Mr Griffin suggests his exhaustive cookery advice could become a regular feature . So he sets about producing British stew, using reduced beef, onions, carrots, beer, tobasco and swede: ‘You can have too much swede… unless you are a goat.’ His tips include not eating the outside of an onion, how cheese can be used on a jacket potato and remembering to remove the foil from stock cubes. Getting political in the kitchen, Mr Griffin goes on: ‘English cookery for centuries was the best in Europe… very advanced, lots of spices. ‘It became very simple after the Hanoverians came over from northern Germany. As you know I spend a lot of time on the continent. ‘I reckon you can go to fancy French restaurants, or fancy restaurants anywhere you like… . ‘You can go to all those fancy restaurants and you won’t get anything in fact certainly no better if as good as you get from decent cooking in a decent English pub these days.’ Cheers: Mr Griffin said the fact he had drunk some of the beer would not harm the recipe . Taste test: BNP members Tony and Chris declared the food was 'very tasty' but the unnamed surly teenager at the table was not asked for her opinion . He later dismisses the idea that the popularity of curry in Britain requires top chefs from Asia. Insisting the word ‘curry’ comes from a 13th century cook book, Mr Griffin declares: ‘Don’t let people tell you that you have to have huge numbers of immigrants to have good cooking.’ He also reveals there is a Mexican restaurant ‘in a town not far from here’. ‘The place isn’t swamped with Mexicans. You take the recipe – that’s really all you need,’ he adds. After half an hour of chopping, stirring and slurping he announces Blue Peter-like: ‘Here’s one I made earlier’. BNP members Tony and Chris are asked to taste the carb-heavy meal before declaring – not too enthusiastically – that it is ‘very nice’. An unnamed, somewhat surly-looking, teenager sitting at the table is not asked for her opinion. Mr Griffin signs off: ‘Give it a go. If you haven’t cooked before, surprise yourself.’ See the full video HERE .","MEP, who was declared bankrupt, is seen cooking in a large kitchen .

Fire starter: Matthew Heckler holding Zeus who chewed through a can of deodorant which caused an explosion . A six-month-old puppy chomped through a can of deodorant which caused a window-shattering explosion. The saluki greyhound cross called Zeus chewed through the can of Lynx and caused a blast so intense that it shattered his owner's double glazed bay window, broke the floorboards and set fire to the sofa. Kerry Leech, 20, and her partner Matthew Heckler, 22, said they were lucky not to have been in during the freak accident at their home in Goldthorpe, South Yorkshire, on Saturday. Firefighters first told the couple that the explosion must have been caused by leaking gas pipes. But after no evidence of a leak was found, they now believe that Zeus chewed through the deodorant can right next to the home's back boiler, located directly behind the living room fire. When the central heating came on just minutes later, a spark ignited the gas and caused the explosion. Mr Heckler, who is currently unemployed, said: 'I didn't even know we had a can of Lynx in the living room. 'It was a Christmas present from Kerry's parents and was in a gift box underneath a table - right next to the fire and back boiler.

Armed police will be given body-worn video cameras to try and restore public trust following the shooting of Mark Duggan. Police marksman were criticised for their accounts of the incident which differed from members of the public. Equipping officers with video cameras would help cut out 'opinions and conjecture' similar to those that have plagued the Duggan investigation. The central question raised by the disputed evidence was whether Duggan, a known drug dealer and member of the notorious Tottenham Mandem, was armed as he emerged from a taxi before being shot. Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said: 'Is it possible to rule out a situation where it turns out the person wasn't holding a lethal weapon? No it's not.' He explained that that issues from imitation firearms to poor lighting mean mistakes are inevitable. He said: 'You can't avoid that, but the officer by law has to justify that they reasonably believed that there was such imminent risk of lethal force being used against them or some other person that they had no choice but to pull the trigger.

When Royal Mail’s share price soared after privatisation, Vince Cable dismissed criticism that it had been undervalued and said a proper view could not be taken for three months. Yesterday – three months on and with the shares worth 70 per cent more than the Government’s sale price – his words came back to haunt him after MPs said taxpayers had been short-changed. Both Conservative and Labour MPs rubbished the Lib Dem Business Secretary’s claim last October that the instant share price rise was just ‘froth’. Both Conservative and Labour MPs rubbished Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable's claim last October that the instant share price rise was just 'froth' Tomorrow is the three-month anniversary of the flotation of Royal Mail which has joined the elite FTSE index of Britain’s 100 biggest companies. The shares were last night worth £2.31 more than the original price. Labour MP Adrian Bailey, chairman of the Business Select Committee which is investigating the sale, said: ‘Froth does not keep bubbling for three months. ‘I think it is reasonable to assume that the shares are at the price which reflects the value of the company.’ The Royal Mail sale was priced at £3.30 a share. But it was hugely oversubscribed and on October 11, when stock market dealing began, the shares rose so rapidly they never traded at this price. Last night, they closed at £5.61, which is 70 per cent higher than the original price. Asked about the rising share price at the time, Mr Cable told the BBC: ‘You get an enormous amount of froth and speculation in the aftermath of a big IPO (flotation) of this kind. ‘It is of absolutely no significance whatsoever. What matters is where the price eventually settles. ‘If we look back at this in three months, six months’ time, or indeed years to come, that’s what we’re really interested in.’ Brian Binley, a Tory MP on the committee, said: ‘I do believe it was sold off too cheaply. The price should have been higher. The City has again let us down.’ Selling the shares for £3.30 each made the Government £1.7billion. If they had been priced at last night’s £5.61, it would have made £2.9billion, an extra £1.2billion. Cable answers questions in front of the Business, Innovation and Skills Select Committee last November over the privatisation of Royal Mail . Chuka Umunna, Labour’s  business spokesman, said: ‘Three months later, Vince Cable’s dismissal of the sharp rise in the share price as froth has been demolished. It increasingly looks like the taxpayer has been left short-changed.’ The National Audit Office is conducting a value-for-money investigation into the privatisation. Results are expected in spring. Mr Cable told MPs after the flotation that the banks which advised the Government on the sale had warned that increasing the price above £3.30 would be unwise. Tory business minister Michael Fallon added: ‘It became very clear to us that there was a point at which institutional investors would not invest.’ Last night, the Department for Business did not comment on the MPs’ criticism.","Last night, they closed at £5.61, which is 70% higher than the original price .

"By . Mark Duell . PUBLISHED: . 12:06 EST, 9 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 04:17 EST, 10 January 2014 . Ejected from his cockpit: Flight Lieutenant Sean Cunningham, 35, was fatally injured in 2011 . A Red Arrows aerial display team pilot who died after he was ejected from his cockpit while on the ground may have been impaired by Night Nurse medicine, an inquest heard today. Flight Lieutenant Sean Cunningham, 35, was fatally injured after being ejected from his Hawk T1 aircraft while on the ground at RAF Scampton in Lincolnshire. The parachute on the ejector seat did not deploy and the South African-born airman - a well-respected and experienced pilot who was also an Iraq war veteran - died in hospital. The inquest has now explored the possibility that the effects of Night Nurse might have played a part in his death. Central Lincolnshire Coroner Stuart Fisher read the findings of a post mortem exam report to the hearing in November 2011. He said tests showed Flt Lt Cunningham had used Night Nurse, which includes the ingredient promethazine, the evening before the incident and, according to the report, the medication could cause some sedation and impair performance in pilots. ‘It is conceivable that side effects of this medication can include drowsiness, blurred vision, disorientation or poor concentration, and could have been responsible for a degree of cognitive impairment, but there is no way of proving this with certainty,’ the inquest heard. However, in written evidence to the inquest another doctor reported it was very unlikely that any sedative effect had remained the following morning. Accident scene: The parachute on the ejector seat did not deploy and the South African-born airman - a well-respected and experienced pilot who was also an Iraq war veteran - died in hospital . ‘It's highly unlikely that the dose of Night Nurse taken on the evening of November 7 had any effects on the deceased's ability to fly a plane at 11 o'clock the following morning.’ Some of Flt Lt Cunningham's team-mates who were with him on the day of the incident told the inquest that he had appeared ‘chirpy’ and ‘jovial’ on the morning of November 8 and did not appear to be unwell or in an altered mood. Other death: The tragedy happened just three months after the death of Red Arrows pilot Flight Lieutenant Jon Egging, 33 . They had been preparing to fly in formation from RAF Scampton to RAF Valley in Wales when they heard a loud bang. Flt Lt James McMillan said he was sitting in his aircraft and close to finishing his pre-flight checks, as was Flt Lt Cunningham who he could see from where he was positioned. ‘I just heard what to me seemed like an enormous bang very, very close,’ he told the inquest. ‘The first thing I thought was that there was something wrong with my aircraft because it was so close to me and I could feel it.’ Flt Lt McMillan said that once he had discounted the noise had come from his own plane he looked across at Flt Lt Cunningham, thinking he had experienced an ‘engine surge’. ‘I assumed it must have been Sean and I looked across at him and that's when I realised that things were not normal.’ Flt Lt McMillan said the canopy from the plane was missing and the ejector pole was sticking out, and he saw Flt Lt Cunningham was outside the aircraft, making him think he was going to see an ejection sequence in action. ‘I remember thinking that something appeared wrong and I expected the sequence to be happening a lot quicker, and the main thing was that I thought I should have seen a parachute in his apex,’ he said. Flt Lt Cunningham was seen ‘windmilling’ his arms in the air before hitting the ground while still strapped to his ejector seat. The inquest heard that he fell from around 200 to 300ft. His cause of death was found to be from multiple injuries due to a fall from height following ejection from an aircraft. Medicine: Night Nurse can cause some sedation and impair performance in pilots, the inquest heard . Following the incident, the RAF grounded all non-essential flying of aircraft fitted with the Mk10 Martin Baker-built ejector seat ‘as a precaution’, but flights later resumed in December 2011, with air chiefs saying they had ‘no remaining safety concerns’. Lincolnshire Police handed over a file concerning Flt Lt Cunningham's death, but the Crown Prosecution Service subsequently said no charges would be brought in relation to the incident. The tragedy happened just three months . after the death of Red Arrows pilot Flight Lieutenant Jon Egging, 33, . from Rutland, who died in an air show crash near Bournemouth Airport in . Dorset in August 2011. Flight . Lieutenant Kirsty Stewart, who had also been part of the aerial display . but has since moved to a ground-based role, told the inquest she flew . the same aircraft that Flt Lt Cunningham had been in on November 4 and . found nothing unusual about it. The inquest also heard evidence in relation to features on the ejector seats relating to safety pins and the seat firing handle. Flt Lt Stewart described an incident in September 2003 when she was an instructor at RAF Valley and had been made acutely aware of the positioning of the handle and pins in relation to the ejector seat. She told the inquest that she had been flying with a student and became aware of a problem concerning the positioning of the handle after they had landed and were taxiing. She said she thought that her handle had become covered by the straps used to secure her in the seat and moved into the wrong position, and it seemed she had not fully inserted her safety pin, meaning she could have been easily ejected from the plane. ‘Since that incident I truly believe that, if the handle is not correctly positioned, that seat pin will not go back in that hole.’ She continued: ‘It strengthened my belief that I was probably millimetres away from movement that meant I was ejected.’ Evidence from around 70 witnesses is expected during the inquiry, which is scheduled to last around three weeks. The inquest continues.","Flight Lieutenant Sean Cunningham, 35, died after accident in Hawk T1 .

A mother grieving her stillborn son was horrified to discover the heartfelt tributes she left on his grave were moved - and later discovered council workers had buried another child on top of it. Funeral directors told Katy Quillan, 29, her baby David, who died in April, would be buried in an individual plot at a cemetery in Southport, Merseyside. The mother-of-one was told her family could decorate the grave with 'whatever they liked' and put up a small picket fence, pebbles and a Christmas tree and Father Christmas, as David was the only person buried there. Katy Quillan gave birth to a stillborn son, David, in April last year and was stunned to discover another baby was buried in his plot. She is pictured with daughter Brooke, 5 . But when she tended her late son's grave at Duke Street cemetery last week, she was horrified to find another child's grave in the same plot. Ms Quillan visited the plot with her family and found her decorations and memorials had been discarded and replaced with a teddy bear and flowers from another grieving family. And when the devastated mother contacted funeral directors and Sefton Council, she was told that a child's grave can be used to bury up to six children. Ms Quillan, from Skelmersdale, Lancashire, said: 'It was just horrible. I feel like I have no where to go now to visit my little boy. 'When we went back to the grave after Christmas, we were shocked to find that all of our decorations had gone. 'All of the stones had been put into a bin bag and the fence and ornaments had been damaged and thrown on the floor. Grim find: Ms Quillan inspects her son's grave. She was told up to six babies could be buried in this type of grave . When she tended her late son's grave at Duke Street cemetery last week, she was horrified to find another child's grave in the same plot . 'It took me hours to decorate David's grave so that me and my daughter had somewhere to go. 'I don't want to move any of the items, I couldn't do that to another mum.' Ms Quillan, who is also mother to Brooke, five, added: 'I was told it was my plot for my baby, and that I could get my own head stone and decorate the grave however I liked. 'When I visited the grave before Christmas it did look like the soil had been turned over, but I didn't even imagine that they might have buried another baby there. 'If I had known this from the start it wouldn't be a problem, but I thought that grave was just for David and to find out that it isn't is heartbreaking. 'I feel like I have been pushed aside and I just want answers. It's disgraceful treatment. 'The other family deserve to know too, I have thought about leaving them a note.' Cemetery operators Sefton Council were contracted to carry out the burial, paid for by Ormskirk District General Hospital, on behalf of David's family. They were instructed by the funeral directors where and when to dig the plot, and insist the responsibility lies with the company to explain the types of graves used to bury children in. A spokesperson for Sefton Council said: 'Situations like these are always difficult because of the emotions involved but we do our very best to ensure that people are treated with the greatest of sympathy and respect. 'As with most funerals, the onus is on the funeral directors to offer bereavement guidance to families and this would include explaining how these type of graves operate.' A spokesperson from Hunters Funeral Directors declined to comment, but acknowledged they were involved in David's burial. If a baby has a hospital burial, they may share a grave with other babies. In some local authority cemeteries, shared graves are in a special area set aside for babies. Some cemeteries use lockable grave covers to protect a shared grave until it’s full and the ground can be filled in. Parents can ask the midwife or nurse if lockable grave covers are used at the local cemetery. If the baby is in a shared grave, you will probably not be able to place any kind of memorial on the grave itself. Some cemeteries have a separate section in another area of the cemetery for memorials or memorial plaques.

This is the first picture of a young mother killed when two boy racers smashed nto her car at almost 70mph in a 30 zone. Emily Phillips, 25, died after speeding driver Paul Hemmingway, who was 19 at the time, lost control of his £5,000 Seat Leon FR and ploughed into the family car being driven by her partner Paul Smith. Bradford Crown Court heard that her two young children, aged seven and four, were also in the back seat of the Vauxhall Astra at the time of the crash in Boothtown, Halifax, last January. Hemmingway had been racing along the . A647 Boothtown Road with uninsured and unlicensed Mark Collins, who was . driving a Mercedes CLK Coupe he had bought that morning. Collins, . 26, of Queensbury, and Hemmingway, 20, formerly of Bradford, both . pleaded guilty to causing Emily's death by dangerous driving today. Both have been jailed. Hemmingway . was sentenced to six-and-a-half years in a young offenders institution . and Collins was jailed for four-and-a-half years for the driving . offence. Speaking after the trial, her ex-partner Paul said the crash had torn the family's life apart. Paul added: 'My family has been blown apart by this. Our lives will never be the same again.' Jonathan . Sharp, prosecuting, read out statements from other concerned motorists . who had seen the cars driving dangerously on the winding road in icy and . snowy conditions. Just . hours before the crash, the Mercedes had been spotted doing handbrake . turns and wheel spins, but Collins denied being behind the wheel at that . time. Family: Emily with partner Paul Smith, daughter Bryony and son Oliver who were in the car at the time . At around 3.30pm on January 13 last . year, Hemmingway and Collins, who each had passengers in their vehicles, . came across each other near Boothtown Road and Mr Sharp said they began . to race along the two-and-a-quarter mile route to the crash scene. Other . motorists, who later gave statements to the police, estimated that the . pair were reaching speeds of more than double the 30mph on the road. It was later calculated that Hemmingway had been travelling at 67mph when his Leon crashed into the Vauxhall.

Collins' lawyer Philip Ainge said . he could not explain why he had decided to follow the Seat Leon that . afternoon and it was a day and a decision which he had played and . replayed again and again in his mind. Judge . Hatton told Hemmingway that he had deliberately engaged in a . 'grotesque' course of driving over a considerable distance in built-up . areas and achieving alarming speeds. Hemmingway had been racing along the A647 Boothtown Road with uninsured and unlicensed Mark Collins, who was driving a Mercedes CLK Coupe . He said: 'You engaged in overtaking manoeuvres forcing several motorists to take evasive action. 'You tailgated and scared motorists who you regarded as impediments to your wantonly dangerous progress. 'The lives and safety of a significant number of people were put in grave danger and the fact that so many members of the public came forward to provide statements is testimony to the truly shocking nature of your driving. 'The Vauxhall Astra vehicle contained the driver's partner and their two young children. 'The lady suffered multiple injuries and a young life was needlessly swept away instantly by reason of your conduct and those young children were rendered motherless. 'The effect upon the family is immense, indeed immeasurable.' Both men were banned from driving for 10 years and must take an extended test before lawfully driving again.","Paul Hemmingway and Mark Collins pleaded guilty to causing Emily Phillip's death by dangerous driving .

During his trial, it was revealed that the cult leader had fathered a child with one victim. Images were also show of the custom-made bed he had built in which to assault the girls. Pedophile Warren Jeffs is serving a life sentence in Texas for the abuse of two underage girls . Jeffs and 11 other members of his cult were jailed following a 2008 raid on Yearning for Zion which found that multiple underage marriages had taken place, often between girls who had just reached puberty and elderly men. The order to seize the ranch came from Judge Barbara Walther, approved by the Attorney General's office in Texas. No one from the FLDS has come forward to contest the seizure, according to Fox 13. The FLDS Church and the ranchâ€™s owner, the United Order of Texas Trust, can appeal the judge's order in the next 30 days.

In 2008, authorities raided the sprawling estate after receiving calls from terrified children who said they had been abused. The move led to a chaotic roundup of 400 children living at the secretive location in what became one of the largest custody cases in U.S. history. During Jeffs' trial, jurors wept as they heard a graphic tape of the twisted sexual instructions he gave his reportedly 80 wives - some of whom were just children.

Jailed: Con artist Alan Fitzgerald preyed on vulnerable pensioners, stealing £300,000 from them for jobs he never finished . An 'aggressive and dishonest' cowboy builder who robbed £300,000 from vulnerable pensioners, including one 94-year-old woman, has been jailed. Alan Fitzgerald, 47, told one elderly female victim she had asbestos in her home and would be prosecuted if she did not pay him a huge sum for unnecessary building work. The conman, from Wellingborough, who has no building qualifications, was jailed for six years after ripping off 39 victims. Fitzgerald took life savings from pensioners across Northamptonshire by overcharging them for work he never even finished. On average he would add more than £20,000 onto a bill for work, which cost less than £9,600. The prosecution described him as 'misleading, aggressive and dishonest' in court and said he would drive victims to cash points to make sure he was paid. Northampton Crown Court heard how Fitzgerald targeted elderly victims, preyed on the infirm and intimidated pensioners by warning that their homes urgently required repair work. Once he had identified a vulnerable victim, he would continue to 'tap the well', the court heard, and would return time and time again to fleece them of more cash. Fitzgerald even continued to rip-off customers after his first appearance in court last year. He has pleaded guilty to two counts of fraudulent trading, one charge in relation to each of his firms. Northamptonshire County Council's trading standards team said it had received complaints about Fitzgerald dating back to 2005 and had issued him with a number of warnings. Sentenced: Fitzgerald was jailed for six years at Northampton Crown Court after he admitted fleecing dozens of victims, including one 94-year-old woman . Officers said there were a further 46 complaints not included in the formal charges. Fitzgerald who has never filed a tax return for his building company, was jailed on Tuesday. Sentencing him, Judge Richard Bray said: 'I have to sentence you for serious premeditated frauds. 'I am satisfied that you targeted vulnerable victims, pressuring them into handing large sums of money to you, often in cash and often representing substantial parts off their life savings. 'Ten of the victims in the first indictment alone were over 70. Many of them were infirm, some of them had carers, . 'One of them was a lady aged 94. You threatened her that she could be prosecuted if she didn't have repair work carried out by you. 'You obtained £6,000 in advance from her for work you didn't carry out properly, or at all. It is a truly despicable offence.'","'Aggressive and dishonest' Alan Fitzgerald, 47, has been jailed for six years .

A drug dealer has been jailed for five years for possessing a dangerous stun gun disguised as a mobile phone, according to police. Officers discovered the weapon, which is capable of discharging 50,000 volts, while searching the home of Wesley Walters in Southampton, Hampshire. The potentially lethal device - designed to look like the Sony Ericsson K95 - is as powerful as a standard-issue police Taser. The 26-year-old had been arrested hours earlier after supplying four wraps of heroin to an undercover officer ass part of Operation Fortress, a police campaign to clamp down on serious violent crime linked to drugs in Southampton. Police raided drug dealer Wesley Walter's home and found a 50,000 volt stun gun disguised as a mobile phone hidden in a wardrobe. The potentially lethal device  is as powerful as a standard-issue police Taser . They also discovered a police-style metal baton. A Hampshire police spokesman said: 'When detectives searched his flat on Rampart Road they found the firearm disguised as a mobile phone in the back of a drawer. 'The weapon, which was capable of discharging 50,000 volts, will be destroyed.' Detective Constable Simon Woods said: 'We targeted Walters’ home after he sold heroin on two occasions to an undercover officer in March.' Shocking: Officers discovered the weapon, which is capable of discharging 50,000 volts, in a cupboard at his home . He added: At court he claimed the stun gun was bought as a novelty item. He said he’d misplaced the charger and had put the weapon at the back of the drawer and hadn’t used it since. 'Even so, he had access to a dangerous weapon which still held a charge and was capable of delivering a very powerful blow.' The Chinese-manufactured Kelin 95 is illegal in this country but widely available on the internet for just £20. When a button on the side is pressed, the powerful electrical charge can stun an opponent into submission. More and more criminals are buying the weapons and some models can discharge far higher - and potentially fatal - charges. It is marketed as a self defence device for law enforcement, security guards and civilians. He added: 'We also found in his flat a police-style . metal baton. It’s unusual for a member of the public to have one in . their possession but because it was in a private place, no offence was . committed . 'It too will be securely disposed of.' Walters pleaded guilty at Southampton Crown Court on Tuesday to possessing a section 5 firearm, for which he was jailed for five years, and two counts of supplying heroin, for which he was jailed for three years and six months to run concurrently. The court heard that Walters had committed more than 20 previous offences, including inflicting grievous bodily harm, possessing an offensive weapon, assault and affray. DC Woods continued: 'The warrants we carried out as part of Operation Fortress were designed to demonstrate that Southampton is a hostile place for anyone coming here to deal drugs and commit acts of violence. 'At the same time, the campaign is finding long term solutions to helping to reduce the demand for drugs.'","Officers found the illegal weapon at the home of Wesley Walters, 26 .

Mark Newton attacked the former Hearts and Falkirk keeper Myles Hogarth (pictured) A fire chief hit a former professional footballer with a baseball bat after discovering he was having an affair with his wife. Mark Newton, 36, attacked the former Hearts and Falkirk keeper Myles Hogarth, 38, as the footballer was leaving the club where he now plays. Hogarth’s injuries included a bruised back, cuts on the head and a two centimetre scar on his face. But Newton has escaped a jail sentence after Hogarth wrote to the sentencing sheriff. Falkirk . Sheriff Court was told that Newton had found out that Hogarth had been . involved in a three year affair with Newton’s wife, Janet, 27. Newton tracked the player down and attacked him with the baseball bat, repeatedly striking him on the body. When . Hogarth ran off, Newton, a crew commander with the Scottish Fire and . Rescue Service in the training division at Falkirk, chased after him and . repeatedly kicked him on the head and body. The court heard that Hogarth . didn’t want police involved but a member of the public witnessed the . brutal attack and noted Newton’s car registration as he drove off before . alerting police. Beverly Adam, prosecuting, said police stopped Newton in his car 10 minutes after the assault. He immediately blurted out: 'I hit a guy with a baseball bat. 'He had been f*****g about with my wife.' Today, Newton, of Grangemouth, appeared . for sentence after pleading guilty to assaulting Hogarth to his severe . injury and permanent disfigurement. The incident occurred at Camelon Juniors’ ground in Fairlie Drive, Falkirk, on May 21 last year. Newton’s solicitor, Gordon Addison, said: 'This plays out with the drama that happens on TV and this is no stranger than fiction. 'He is a normal hardworking citizen and family man who has snapped in this situation. 'The complainer has made his position clear from the outset that he had no interest in Mr Newton being charged or punished. 'He accepts some responsibility for this situation. 'Mr Newton has taken steps to make sure this won’t happened again. 'The master plan is to reconcile with his family.' Sheriff John Mundy ordered Newton to pay £1,000 compensation to Mr Hogarth, but made no other order. The sheriff said: 'You will appreciate this is a very serious case and it could have had much more serious consequences. 'Fortunately it was only this. 'I take into account your references, that you have no previous convictions, and that you have employment, and I have the letter from the complainer stating his position. 'All that has persuaded me in taking the unusual step of not imposing a custodial sentence or community payback order. 'I will instead impose a compensation order and that should be for £1,000.' Falkirk Sheriff Court was told that Newton had found out that Hogarth had been involved in a three year affair with Newton¿s wife . Since the affair was exposed, Hogarth and his wife Jennifer have split and the family’s home in Falkirk has been sold. Jennifer, 39, said: 'We have now separated.' Newton and Janet, who married in 2007, have also separated. Leaving court Newton, who was dressed in a smart black suit, said: 'It’s a bad situation - I don’t want to say anything more.'

Jailed: Crisp factory worker Colin Goulding, 31, who started the blaze by having a sneaky cigarette . A crisp factory worker who went into a storeroom to have a crafty cigarette accidentally started a huge fire which caused a £25million blaze and cost 100 of his colleagues their jobs. Colin Goulding, 31, was jailed for over six years for starting the blaze which was described by a judge as the 'most expensive arson' he had ever seen. The court heard it took 65 firefighters to put out the blaze at the Real Crisp factory in Crumlin, near Newport, South Wales. Goulding was worried about being caught smoking by his bosses so threw the cigarette away in a hurry, the court was told. But it landed in a pile of crisp packet wrappers starting a blaze which engulfed the factory in just 10 minutes. Everyone lost their jobs - including . the defendant's parents who also worked in the factory - when the owner's . decided not to rebuild it. Judge Philip Richards told Goulding: 'This was a ridiculous thing to do. Lighting a cigarette in this warehouse would have been, to any rational person, a most unwise act. 'I accept you didn’t mean to cause this fire, which had devastating consequences for your own family and so many others.' He was working on a night shift on a production line boxing packets of crisps when he sneaked off for a cigarette at 3am, the court heard. Danger: Goulding is seen walking off to have a cigarette moments before the fire started. As a result, more than 100 people lost their jobs . Caught in the act: Colin Goulding, 31, is seen sneaking off into a storeroom for a cigarette moments before the fire started . Blaze: The huge fire rips through the factory, near Newport, South Wales. The whole building had to be demolished and all the workers lost their jobs . Wreckage: The burnt out shell of a factory after the blaze had been put out by a team of 65 firefighters last September . Prosecutor Matthew Roberts said: 'He admits breaking the healthy and safety codes and company policy. 'The reason these rules are in place is because one is dealing with extremely flammable material in an extremely volatile environment. 'He had no legitimate reason to enter the goods warehouse - all he needed for his work was within arms reach of his packaging station. 'But he left to have a cigarette, walked into the goods warehouse and lit it. He moved into the storage area when he thought someone was behind him so he discarded it. 'The seat of the fire was in the packaging area, it’s obvious to anyone that discarding a lit cigarette in this area carried a risk to life and property. Blaze: The court heard that Goulding, who is of low intelligence, did not even realise it was him that had started the fire . Fire: The court heard there were there were 40 tons of potatoes and 60,000 litres of cooking oil on the site when the fire started . 'The fire started easilly and spread quickly causing irreversible damage to virtually all of the factory. The damage was so extensive that the factory burnt to the ground and was entirely demolished. 'It’s fortunate, and through no fault of this defendant, that no one was hurt or killed.' The factory made Irish crisp Taytos, British supermarket own brands and crisps for international buyers. The court heard that at the time of the blaze on September 20, 2012, there were 40 tons of potatoes and 60,000 litres of cooking oil on the site. The court heard Goulding, who is of low intelligence, had no idea his cigarette started the fire. He filmed the blaze on his camera phone - as his colleagues rushed to escape - before calling 999. Father-of-one Goulding, of Abertillery, South Wales, admitted arson being reckless as to whether life was endangered. Wreckage: Everyone lost their jobs - including the defendant's parents who also worked in the factory - when the owner's decided not to rebuild it . Huw Evans, defending, said: 'He did not intend to start the fire - this was a careless and avoidable act - but it was not intentional. 'He carelessly discarded the cigarette but as far as he was concerned, when he discarded it it was in a place where no fire could have started. 'He didn’t appreciate it was dangerous, but maybe he should have done.' Judge Richards told him: 'There’s no doubt that most people would understand what you did to be a wholly reckless act.' 'This is far and away the most serious arson I have ever contended with - I’ve not seen a case where the damage amounts to anything like this. 'The cost was not merely financial but devasting to the community, to fellow employers and to your parents.' He was given a total of six years and three months behind bars.

A revolutionary method of destroying cancer cells in the blood stream before they infect other parts of the body has been discovered by biomedical engineers. Proteins that kill cancer cells can be attached to white blood cells - which protect the body from infections - so that as they travel through the blood, they also destroy cancerous cells. This new technique prevents the disease from infecting other organs, U.S. researchers said. Proteins that kill cancer cells can be attached to white blood cells (pictured using a SEM and magnified x6,600) - which protect the body from infections - so that as they travel through the blood, they also destroy cancerous cells . Proteins that kill cancer cells - E-selectin, an adhesive, and Tumour Necrosis Factor Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand (TRAIL) - can be attached to white blood cells. Together the proteins stick to white blood cells, which are abundant in the bloodstream. When a cancer cell comes into contact with TRAIL, which is nearly unavoidable in the frenzied flow of blood, the cancer cell essentially kills itself. The engineers said the repurposing of white blood cells in flowing blood is more effective than directly targeting the cancer cells with liposomes or soluble protein. Surgery and radiation are effective at treating primary tumours, but difficulty in detecting metastatic cancer cells (cancerous cells that spread from one organ to another) has made treatment of the spreading cancers very difficult. However, researchers at  Cornell University, New York, believe their new technique solves this problem. Michael King, professor of biomedical engineering at the university, said: ‘These circulating cancer cells are doomed. ‘About 90 per cent of cancer deaths are related to metastases, but now we’ve found a way to dispatch an army of killer white blood cells that cause apoptosis - the cancer cell’s own death - obliterating them from the bloodstream. ‘When surrounded by these guys, it becomes nearly impossible for the cancer cell to escape.’ Professor King injected human blood samples and later mice, with two proteins in laboratory tests. Surgery and radiation are effective at treating primary tumours, but difficulty in detecting metastatic cancer cells (cancerous cells that spread from one organ to another) has made treatment of the spreading cancers very difficult. A scan of pulmonary metastases is pictured . One protein was an adhesive called E-selectin and the other was Tumour Necrosis Factor Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand (TRAIL). The TRAIL protein joined with the E-selectin protein stick to leukocytes, otherwise known as white blood cells, which are abundant in the bloodstream. When a cancer cell comes into contact with TRAIL, which is nearly unavoidable in the frenzied flow of blood, the cancer cell essentially kills itself, the researchers explained in the study, which is published online in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

When treating cancer cells with the proteins in saline, the researchers found a 60 per cent success rate in killing the cancer cells. In normal laboratory conditions, the saline lacks white blood cells to serve as a carrier for the adhesive and killer proteins. However, once the proteins were added to flowing blood that mimicked human-body conditions, the success rate in killing the cancer cells jumped to nearly 100 per cent.","Specially selected proteins can be .

The support worker, from Barking in London, was forced to give birth to her as-yet-unnamed daughter in the nearest toilet as there was no time to transport her from the airport to a hospital.

The unnamed baby (right) arrived three days before her predicted due date . Ms Hamisi had not been due to give birth until January 4, but a family emergency forced her to travel to Africa for the Christmas period. It wasn't until she stepped off the plane that Ms Hamisi realised her baby was on its way, at which point she asked airport staff to help her to a toilet. Ms Hamisi, who already has two children, says she remembers little of the birth other than it taking place in the arrivals hall toilet. Speaking of the birth, Ms Hamisi said: .

She says she will name the new arrival at some point over the next few days. A Heathrow Airport spokesman confirmed a baby had been born on its property on New Year's Day.

A 30 stone man required 24 members of the emergency services to free him from his car after a crash. Steve Wilson's size meant that instead of walking away from the scene with a dented vehicle, his car was reduced to scrap metal and he had to be winched out by fire fighters risking their own health. His story is featured in a new Channel 5 . series, Big Body Squad, which shows how the emergency services must be increasingly prepared to deal with the fall-out of super-sized people. Supersize: 30 stone Steve Wilson required 24 members of the emergency services to free him from his car after a crash . A quarter of Britons are now obese and the emergency services are feeling the full effect of the country's waistlines. Not only are the call-outs more demanding and time consuming, they also mean that other calls can't be dealt with - and cost three times the usual rescue amount. Daily call outs mean the cost of rescuing overweight people has soared to £1m over five years. In County Durham, where this incident occurred, call outs have soared by 150 per cent since 2008. There are currently 800 purpose-built . big body ambulances in the UK and the number is steadily rising, . costing the UK taxpayer millions each year. Because of his size, Steve is wedged behind the car's steering wheel - and there's no hope of the 52-year-old getting out by himself. A truck with heavy lifting gear arrives - followed by the Police, Ambulance Service and three fire trucks - bringing the total number of crew to 24. There are four police officers, five paramedics and 15 firefighters on the scene. His size meant that instead of walking away from the scene with a dented vehicle, his car was reduced to scrap metal and he had to be winched out by fire fighters risking their own health . The fire crew needs as much space as possible to try and get to him and free him - but due to his huge 30st frame, they can only get the space they need by slicing metal dangerously lose to his head. This means that one slip-up could be catastrophic. In order to try and get to him, firefighters have to snap his seat and remove the door and the roof of the car - reducing it to scrap metal. With a potential spine injury, it is important to keep Steve still. But because he's so overweight there are no neck collars that fit him, the rescue team are forced to use a rolled-up blanket to try and keep him still. Steve is so overweight there are no neck collars that fit him, so the rescue team are forced to use a rolled-up blanket . When firefighters have finally chopped him from the car, it is time to lift him out. At 30 stone, it's a difficult lift and the crew are putting their backs in danger with such a weight. Lifting him the few feet from the car to the ambulance takes 11 people five minutes  - and costs £1,500 than it would normally. Steve is able to leave hospital after a check-up and says he 'hopes' to lose weight. For the first time in history, obesity is killing more people than malnutrition. Around 15 million Britons are obese and it is estimated that this will cost the UK a staggering £27 billion by 2016.

Thigh society: This week, 58-year-old Carole Middleton decided to wear a short skirt - and it looks wonderful . Long, shapely and with curves in all the right places, these are a pair of pins that any 20-something would kill for. But allow your eye to drift a little further up and you'll see this is no spring chicken. This is Carole Middleton, the 58-year-old mother of our future Queen. Doesn't she look wonderful? Foxy even. But what's that? Too short a skirt for a woman of her vintage you say? Poppycock! For as elegant women like Carole - and me - know, age need not rule out you modelling a short skirt. If you've got legs as lovely as Carole's, it's a sin not to show them off. In fact, I wear skirts shorter than her and I'm six years older than she is. But, sadly, Carole's decision to wear a short skirt this week opened a rich seam of vitriol. If some of the insults I've read online are anything to go by, older women who bare their legs do so at their peril, as poor Carole is discovering to her cost. From the she-should-put-them-away brigade to the nice-legs-shame-about-the-face crowd, that A-line skirt cut a mere two inches above her finely shaped knees has placed Carole firmly in the stocks. One Mail Online reader - Marian Brookes from Flitwick - said: 'This lady ought to dress with the appropriate decorum befitting her age; after the age of 50, ladies should wear clothes to the knee or just below. I am much more elegant, of a similar age and build and would never contemplate being seen in that apparel. What has happened to elegance and dignity?' And another reader was even more scathing, saying: 'This would not even look good on someone half her age. She is a deluded woman living in the past.' How sad. But surely bruising commentary like this says more about the critics than its target. This extraordinary flowering of prejudice that blossoms whenever older women show off their legs is notable for two things - how often it happens and the depth of hypocrisy exposed. While younger women with terrible legs - and I've seen some shockers, including 20-somethings in tiny denim shorts exposing mountainous thighs bearing glaciers of cellulite - can run around baring all without as much as a raised eyebrow, things are very different for ladies like me. Foxy lady: For elegant women like Carole, age need not rule out you modelling a short skirt . Any woman who reaches her 50s, however svelte or beguiling, seems to be precluded from even so much as suggesting a knee. What century do these people live in? It would seem that young women inhabit a world of the Miley Cyrus nude-coloured bikini exposing acres of flesh, while older women are expected to all but return to the Victorian age, complete with floor-sweeping dresses to disguise any semblance of curve. The hypocrisy is particularly interesting since there is a constant and deafening chorus of complaints from women as they age that they become invisible. Yet when a woman in her 50s dares to hint at her sex appeal, she is victimised. We should cheer her from the rooftops. Why? After all, sexuality is important to us all. Granted, any sensible woman knows we can't hold on to the allure we had in our 20s and 30s, but turning 50 doesn't mean we do not long for the turn of a head or a too-lingering glance. Becoming a middle-aged woman doesn't mean the glint in your eye is deadened for ever. Certainly, at some point during these years, we hand over the torch of sexuality to our daughters, but still that does not mean we have to become sexually redundant. We can all see Carole is a vivacious woman. Lucky Michael Middleton, I say. But as Carole is discovering to her cost, she is at a dangerous juncture in the evolution of her sexuality. I know - aged 64, I've been through those rocky years. Every woman in her late 50s enjoys being admired, but you tread on a hair's breadth of propriety. Those who sashay into middle age are accused of being muttony; those who surrender to middle age are accused of giving up. Like daughter, like mother: Pippa (right) and Carole showing off their equally toned legs as they go shopping . But I believe Carole is neither. She is an unapologetic cheerleader for the elegant older lady who refuses to give in to convention. Far from being denigrated, she should be applauded as a torchbearer for women who do not wish to define themselves by their birthdate. She is perennially well-appointed, well turned out and always appropriate. All of us who aspire to something other than a lifetime in midi-length skirts and bootleg trousers should cheer her. Just because you can doesn't mean you should! M. J., Abingdon, Oxfordshire . Grandmother of a future King of England? You can't buy class. Chris R., Cardiff . Skirt . length is far too short. Seems the Middleton ladies share a wardrobe! Carole needs to go for softer colours and not try to dress as a . 30-year-old. Louloum, Bathgate . Those tights are ridiculous on a woman of Carole's age. They scream: 'Look at me, look at me!!!' Harriet . Wearing such a short coat and skirt, how old does she think she is: 25? Hoodoogirl, Bedfordshire . The mother dresses younger than the daughters! Bora Bora Brew . Mrs Middleton's skirts are gradually getting shorter. Caroline, Suffolk . BUT AT LEAST SHE HAS ONE FAN. . . Fashion . should be worn to suit the body, no matter what the age. An in shape . and toned 58-year-old looks much better in a short skirt with . eye-catching, patterned tights and on-trend ankle boots than an . out-of-shape 20-year-old with no muscle tone would look in the same . style. Mrs Middleton looks great! Flanders . So why does her look work? Carole follows the golden rule of short skirts: avoid nude tights. While her daughters Kate and Pippa can certainly get away with flesh-coloured stockings, they're a big no-no for women like Carole. Wearing short skirts with nude tights does not work for older women, however good our legs. It looks ageing and would show up all manner of thread veins and bumps on the upper leg if you got too close.  So Carole's black patterned tights under a warm black coat allowed her to flawlessly dart about town while probably turning a few heads.  What woman of any age will complain about that ? As I said, I am blessed with good legs and still wear short skirts, but with care. Yes, I wear a skirt three or four inches above my knee, but only with tights that are patterned or 40 denier. When the weather heats up and I am forced into flesh-coloured tights to let my pins breathe, my skirt lengths descend to nearer the knee, just as Carole's do. Too many inches of flesh-coloured thigh, however toned and slim, make the sheep start bleating. It screams that the wearer is trying to look young, as opposed to smart. Surely this is what these bitchy commentators believe Carole is trying to be: youthful, rather than sprightly.  But she's not clinging to youth. She's displaying her glamorous side. What's wrong with that? The prejudice that says an older woman can't display her legs, even if they are supermodel-worthy, is not just cruel, but way past its sell-by date. It is hypocritical to insist 50-somethings aren't 'old' then criticise them for not conforming to an old-fashioned stereotype. Instead of denigrating and criticising women like Carole Middleton, we should get behind her. All power to those knees I say.","This week, the 58-year-old stepped out in a short skirt .

Your next secretary could be one of the most famous Jeopardy! champs of all time because the supercomputer that beat Ken Jennings just moved a step closer to becoming available to businesses everywhere. IBM announced Thursday it's investing over $1 billion to give its Watson supercomputer a business division in New York City dedicated to offering the ‘human-like’ technology to hospitals, banks and other groups through the cloud. That means Watson’s unmatched data-crunching prowess may soon be employed as a secretary, a customer service representative, or countless other jobs that will require it to engage one-on-one with human beings. Scroll down for video . 'I'm afraid I can't do that, Ken': Watson, the IBM supercomputer that beat Jeopardy champ Ken Jennings will get its own $1 billion business division housed in New York City's East Village . Armonk, New York-based IBM said the new business unit will be dedicated to the development and commercialization of the project that first gained fame by defeating a pair of ‘Jeopardy!’ champions, including 74-time winner Jennings, in 2011. In the years since Watson's TV appearance, IBM has been developing the supercomputer for more practical purposes and changed it to a cloud-based service. Its massive computing capabilities once took a device the size of a room, but Watson is now that size of three stacked pizza boxes, according to BetaNews. IBM says Watson is unique because it it's programed like traditional computers and uses artificial intelligence to learn from its past experiences and factor that information into its future operations. Human-like: IBM says the supercomputer thinks like a human and will put its unprecedented data-crunching capabilities to use in the cloud for use by banks, healthcare companies and other businesses and will even engage with customers . ‘IBM has transformed Watson from a quiz-show winner, into a commercial cognitive computing breakthrough that is helping businesses engage customers, healthcare organizations personalize patient care, and entrepreneurs build businesses,’ said Michael Rhodin, who will head the new Watson Group. IBM CEO Ginni Rometty said that Watson is built for a world where big data is transforming every industry and every profession. ‘Watson does more than find the needle in the haystack,’ Rometty said in remarks released ahead of the company's Thursday presentation. ‘It understands the haystack. It understands context.’ As part of its investment, IBM is building a new headquarters for the business on the edge of New York City's East Village near New York University and other technology companies. About $100 million will go toward investing in startup companies that are building apps to be run through Watson. Artificial intelligence: After starting with a team of just 27, the business will employ 2,000 people. IBM says $100 million of the initial billion will go toward funding startup tech companies that will run through Watson . Eventually the business, which started out as a team of 27 people, will employ about 2,000, including several hundred at the new headquarters, IBM said. Rhodin, a long-time IBM, said the move marks the start of a new era for IBM and the new headquarters is meant to be a departure from the project's current research facility's sleepier surroundings about 40 miles north of the city in Yorktown Heights, N.Y. The angular glass building also will stand out from the rest of its neighborhood, which is home to some of the oldest buildings in the city. ‘The millennial generation gets this, they understand that this is,’ Rhodin said in an interview ahead of the announcement. ‘This is a departure. It's a statement on our part.’ The will have marketing and sales capabilities, while also hosting engineering and development work and collaborations with customers and startup companies looking to utilize Watson's capabilities.","IBM announced plans to give the Watson Supercomputer its own New York City offices .

A pensioner has been left stunned after a malicious phone call from a family of travellers led armed police to swoop on his vehicle while he was searching for his missing dog. James McTear, 67, says that despite officers swarming around his Jeep in Workington, Cumbria, all they found were a pair of walking sticks - although his Spaniel was later discovered badly inured and needed to be put down. Officers are believed to have arrived at the scene after a local traveller family falsely claimed Mr McTear was carrying a firearm and had threatened to set fire to their caravan and kill their children. Accused: James McTear, 67, says officers swarmed his vehicle late on New Year's Eve. The businessman and his wife Anne, who runs the Cumberland Hotel in Workington, had been searching for their missing dog . Mr McTear, a businessman, said he’d been out late on New Year's Eve searching in heavy rain for a missing Spaniel that belonged to his granddaughter. He says his only encounter with travellers that evening had been when he noticed an unlit caravan, van and a car blocking the road behind St Helen’s Business Park. Mr McTear says that some time later, while driving past Northside roundabout near Workington on New Year’s Eve, he was pulled over by armed police. 'I saw flashing blue lights in my rear . view mirror. I began to pull over towards the kerb to allow it to pass . when it swerved in front,' he said. He added: 'Three fully armed policemen got out, shouting at me while pointing their guns at my front and side windows... I didn’t have time to be scared, and my first reaction was one of anger.' False: The traveller family claimed James McTear had a gun and had threatened to kill their children . The officers ordered Mr McTear to get out his vehicle and lay on the ground in heavy rain. Blocking off the roundabout's exits, they began searching his Jeep but found only a pair of walking sticks. Police later told Mr McTear that had pulled him over after reports of a disturbance at a local traveller site. He subsequently found out that officers had even visited his wife Anne, who runs the Cumberland Hotel in Workington, after she too had been accused of assaulting the travellers. Mrs McTear had been helping her husband search for the missing dog earlier in the evening but returned to the hotel to look after guests on a busy New Year's Eve. The missing Spaniel, which belonged to Mr McTear's eight-year-old granddaughter Amelia, who tragically lost her mother to cancer last year, was later found badly hurt and needed to be put down. It is thought the elderly dog had slipped and fallen onto railway lines in the dark, causing extensive injuries. Police confirmed that they were called to the business park at 11.05pm following reports of a disturbance. They were told that men in two vehicles had been causing problems, and that one was carrying a handgun and had made violent threats. A police spokesman added: 'Cars matching the description were located nearby and both were searched and no weapons found. 'The drivers were spoken to, and officers found no cause for concern. 'The cars had been in the St Helen’s Business Park area, but no offences were found to have taken place.' Sergeant Peter Garforth said: 'When we received the report that a firearm may have been involved it was important to ensure that trained officers were available to deal with any possible scenario. Thankfully in this case no weapons were found to be involved. 'We have to take any reports of firearms seriously and our priority is to protect the public. 'We would never wish to cause anyone unnecessary stress. However, we can only act on information available at the time.'","James McTear, 67, says officers swarmed vehicle late on New Year's Eve .

Mr Spirescu says he now plans to . bring his teenage girlfriend to live with him in England even though he . quit his job on the first day of work. He . says he is in a relationship with a 19-year-old called Catalina Curcean . who has remained at the couple's bleak farmhouse home in the remote . Transylvanian village of Pelisor. Ms Curcean told Romanian media: 'Victor wants to stay there, to go to work. He found three jobs to choose. We talked last night… When he finds one, I plan to go as well’ A source at the car wash where he had worked said: 'He worked last Friday for the very first time and that was when he was photographed by the Daily Mail as the guys showed him the ropes and welcomed him to the country.' 'He did a full day and then came back to the house we all share in the town. 'The next day he said he needed to take the day off and was going to see his brother in London. 'On Saturday night he came back to the house and grabbed his bag and possessions and just left. 'We do not know where he is or what he is doing now and can't reach him on his Romanian mobile because he has turned it off to save on roaming charges. 'Basically he came, car washed for a day and quit.' Staff at the car wash categorically denied that Victor had been sacked. Speaking to Romanian media, Mr Spirescu confirmed that he had quit his fledgling car washing career saying: ‘I was not fired, I left. There has been a lot of lies told about me, and it all ended up too much.' Mysterious disappearance: Mr Spirescu, left, on his single day's work at the car wash outside Biggleswade Aldi . He added: 'My boss came to me and told . me that he did not want to have problems after reading what was written . in the newspapers, he did not like the coverage, and my colleagues had . suffered as well, so I chose to leave. I had no other choice.’ Earlier this week it emerged that Victor had a previous conviction for assaulting his former girlfriend in Bucharest in 2009. It was reported he had knocked the woman - named as 'Ana' - to the ground and punched her after she ended their relationship. When questioned he refused to deny the incident and would only say: 'The past is the past - but we live in the present.' Victor is now in a relationship with a 19-year-old Roma woman called Catalina who has remained at the couple's bleak farmhouse home in the remote Transylvanian village of Pelisor.","Victor Spirescu was one of first to arrive in UK after border controls lapsed .

But for those determined to stick to the resolution of a healthier lifestyle, MailOnline has teamed up with international rugby star James Haskell to make sure your plan lasts longer than your first trial month at the gym. Although the recipe hasn’t changed – eating smart and working out are still the only way to bake a healthy body - there are many, many of ways to get the result you are looking for, no matter where you are in life. Get fit like a pro: For rugby player James Haskell, staying fit is a full-time occupation - so he knows his stuff . STARTING YOU OFF: . Warm-up is key. If you are a member of a gym, foam rollers are readily available, and can be purchased in a sports shop or online. However, a rugby/American football ball for the main muscles and a golf ball to target trigger points are great alternatives. It is not painless, especially if you often run straight into a workout without warming up, but as it helps increase blood flow and warm up the muscle tissue it is a worthwhile practice to incorporate into your workout routine. Ten rolls back and forward on your main muscle groups (back, calves, glutes, quads and hamstrings) and your body will thank you. They see me rollin: Using foam rollers is an excellent way to get your muscles warm before a workout . All fired up: A good ten rolls back and forward on each muscle group will ensure that you are ready to start your workout and avoid straining your muscles . 'These warm up techniques can be used at any age, a lot of people go in to the gym, especially when you are young, don't warm up properly and go straight into lifting,' James says. 'You don't need to be there for hours, you don't need to be a yoga master, what you need to do is to get your body into a good position to lift, so that no matter what you do, whether it is a bench press or a squat, your body is in line and your muscles aren't sleeping.' Below, James has put together . exercises which can be adapted to your goal, whether it is to get fit or . get fitter, no matter where you are in life. He says that 2014 . is the year to be inspired by our childhood, no matter our age. 'If . working out becomes a chore, it will never last longer than the end of . the month, so make it playful and fun. 'These exercises are supposed to be about accessibility, they work for everyone, especially for women. 'Many women fear that lifting weights is going to make them bulky, but that is never going to be the case. 'If you have limited space and time, a kettlebell and some rubberbands will get you a long way.' Kettleball overhead lift: Hold two kettlebells as James is showing in the picture and lift both arms high . Medicine ball abdominal 1: Sit on the floor with your feet lifted, hold the medicine ball or equivalent with both hands and lift it from side to side, touching the floor on each side . Kettlebell swing: Create a stable base with your legs at shoulder width, 'ass to the grass', clench your abdominal muscles and swing the kettlebell from between your legs and out as you stand up . 20S AND EARLY 30S . For . many, our 20s and early 30s are about forging a career, building a . social network and navigating romantic pitfalls. But this is also the time when we build a base upon . which our fitness can rest when our lives are less self-centred. When . getting your cardio in, channel your inner 80s kid and get back on your . wheels. Roller skating or long-boarding is a different way of pounding . the pavement when you feel like mixing up your jogging. James . says: 'Rollerblading again will work your leg muscles and depending on . for how long and how fast you go, you will build some body conditioning . too.‘ . LATE 30S AND 40S . Stereotypically, . our late 30s and 40s is a time involving focus on family, partners and . children, turning life into less ‘heels and cocktails’ and more ‘walking . boots and milk bottles’. Hours . in the gym are exchanged for weekends spent in the park, which James . says is a perfect opportunity to fit in some training time. Get your old . skipping rope from the attic and even a few minutes will raise your . pulse. If you have a partner, get together and incorporate interval . training and body weight exercises such as using a park bench for . step-ups and dips and burpees and lizard crawls to keep your heart rate . up. Medicineball abdominal 2: Lie down on your back and hold the medicine ball over your head . Medicineball abdominal 2: Sit up, bringing the ball over your head, and slam it into the ground as you come down with your arms . With your legs at shoulder width, hold . the medicine ball at chest level. Squat holding the ball and as you come . back to an upright position, throw the ball as high as you against the . wall, and catch it on the way back . James says: ‘Skipping . works your legs, your calves, your quads as well as your cardiovascular . system. It’s a great exercise widely used by many sports people, . requiring an entire body hit of conditioning.’ In your 30s and 40s, focus should move from pure fitness to more mobility exercises in order to stay fit and healthy as you age. 50S, 60S, AND ONWARDS . Increasingly . independent children means time to enjoy adult life again, but if you . want to maintain your health, it is important to continue to exercise, . even if it is at a slower pace. James . says: ‘An hour’s walk over different gradients will raise the heart . rate and help to burn off some of calories. Just make sure you have the . appropriate supportive footwear and clothing on when you do so.’ James recommends adding a training supplement to get the best results from your fitness routine 2014. 'Getting the result you want is about training hard, training well, eating smart and ensuring you get a proper recovery process,' he says. No surprises then that James put his own expertise to the test to create Hades and Hella pre-trainer and fatburner supplements. Hades (for men) and Hella (for women) was created by James when he struggled to find supplements that he as a professional athlete could safely take. Hades, Hella and James' own Organic Virgin Coconut Oil Tagaloa are available on jhbodyfire.com . Even . 10-15 minutes of daily body weight routines such as squats and abdominal . exercises will see your health improve within weeks. 'Using a rubber band to stretch is particularly good when you have been working a long time and you may have problems with your back or legs, and they are easy to pick up online,' James says. 'Overhead dislocation sounds horrific, but it's not. Holding a rubber band at chest level and stretching it out over your head, behind your back opens up your chest.' 'Even if you cannot fit in going to the gym, a lot of exercises with bands and medicine balls is easy to do anywhere, even in your front room.' 'There is a difference between training, which is what you do in the early part in your life, when you are looking to get in shape, lose weight and perform, and exercising which is in the later part of your life when focus is on maintaining a healthy living.'

Gangster: Mark Duggan was lawfully shot dead by police in Tottenham, an inquest jury concluded . A member of Mark Duggan's gang threatened to murder two police officers in retaliation for the killing of the father-of-six, it was claimed today. The gangster allegedly made the threat in the days after rioting and looting erupted on streets across the country in the wake of the 29-year-old's death. The startling claim emerged today after an inquest concluded that Mr Duggan was lawfully shot dead by armed officers when his taxi was halted in Tottenham, north London, in August 2011. Jurors who heard the case are now being given special protection after the gangster's family reacted angrily to their verdict. The seven women and three men were chased from the courtroom and threatened by Mr Duggan's supporters. Judge Keith Cutler, who presided over the case, ordered that the panel be granted indefinite anonymity and unusually their names were never read out in open court. They were referred to by number instead and it is believed they were given a police escort from the building. Scotland Yard last night declined to comment on any measures to protect them. Following the angry scenes in court, riot police are bracing themselves for a fresh outbreak of disorder in London in the wake of the four-month inquest. Tensions are likely to run high in Tottenham tomorrow when a vigil for Mark Duggan is scheduled to be held. According to The Times, in the days after Mr Duggan's death a fellow member of the Tottenham Man Dem gang told a police officer that two policemen would be murdered in retaliation. Just days later officers were asked to give the same man protection amid claims he could be shot or stabbed to death if he attended the wake for the father-of-six. Defiance: Mark Duggan's aunt Carole Duggan declares 'no justice, no peace' as supporters of the gangster react angrily to the jury's verdict . Tensions: Police talk to members of the public on Tottenham High Road yesterday amid fears of fresh violence following the Mark Duggan inquest verdict . It is not known if police took any action on the back of the information they received and the event passed off without incident. The gangster involved, who cannot be identified, is a wealthy businessman living in an affluent area and has never been convicted of violent crimes. He was never named at the inquest because of data protection laws. Police intelligence shown to The Times said that the man said two policemen would be shot as officers tried to arrest three known gang members in a black BMW in north London. The report said: 'A large crowd gathered whilst Officers were dealing with the Males. '[The alleged gangster] was seen nearby... [He] approached Officers and tried to engage them in conversation. Reaction: The killing of Mark Duggan by police marksmen led to rioting in London across the country in August 2011. In the days after violence erupted, a member of Mark Duggan's gang allegedly said that two police officers would be murdered in retaliation .

A firearm which was found six metres away from the spot where Mark Duggan was killed . 'References were made to the shooting of Mark DUGGAN by Police and mentioned made that 2 Officers were going to be shot in retaliation.' After jurors were abused following the inquest verdict on Wednesday, gangster Duggan’s fiancee Semone Wilson refused to apologise. She also made the extraordinary claim that the jurors had been part of a conspiracy with ‘unknown forces’ to exonerate the police of any blame for his death. Miss Wilson, 32, claimed the jeering and fury that followed the jury’s verdict of lawful killing was justified because ‘we were all angry’. She said her family were devastated by the jury’s conclusion and accused jurors of having being ‘coached’. ‘No one in their right mind could come to that conclusion,’ she said. ‘Justice has completely failed, I have no faith in it whatsoever.","Gangster 'told police two officers would be shot in retaliation'

A lack of exercise means British women are among the most likely in the world to suffer from three forms of cancer . A lack of exercise means British women are among the most likely in the world to suffer from three forms of cancer. The UK has the tenth highest rate of bowel, breast and womb cancer out of more than 180 countries, research has found. Experts said that poor physical fitness is increasing women’s risk of developing the three forms of the disease, all of which are linked to a lack of exercise. ‘These figures reflect the sedentary lifestyles of many people in Western countries, with lots of us spending too much time sitting around and not incorporating physical activity into our daily routine,’ said Dr Rachel Thompson of the World Cancer Research Fund. Britain had 133 cases of bowel, breast and womb cancer per 100,000 people, the statistics showed. Barbados had the most out of the nations studied, while the Bahamas had the ninth highest rate. But Dr Thompson said data collection from these two countries was less reliable than in Western Europe and the US, and the numbers affected were far smaller. In effect, this means that the UK has the eighth highest rate, topped only by Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, France, Iceland, Luxembourg and the US. Britain fared worst when it came to breast cancer. For this form of the disease alone, it had the seventh highest rate out of the countries studied, the International Agency for Research on Cancer statistics showed. Scientists estimate that about 12 per cent of bowel and breast cancer cases could be prevented if people were more physically active. For womb cancer, the figure is at least 10 per cent. Britons are advised to do 150 minutes a week of moderate activity, such as gardening. This is thought to help by allowing people to stay slimmer, which cuts the amount of cancer-promoting hormones produced by body fat. The UK has the tenth highest rate of bowel, breast and womb cancer out of more than 180 countries, research has found . However, just 36 per cent of women meet the moderate exercise target. Dr Thompson added: ‘It is a major concern that women in the UK are placed so highly in the world for cancers that are partially preventable through people being more physically active. ‘Regular activity can help strengthen the immune system, keep hormone levels healthy and the digestive system in good shape, all of which help reduce our chances of developing cancer.’ Last year, US researchers  found women who walk for an hour a day can cut their risk of breast cancer in later life. Those who took part in vigorous activity received almost double the protection. A spokesman for Breakthrough Breast Cancer said: ‘We’ve known for some time that being active can reduce a woman’s risk of breast cancer.‘We advise that 30 minutes of moderate physical activity a day, or 3.5 hours a week, can reduce breast cancer risk by at least 20 per cent. ‘Any activity that raises your pulse reduces your risk – so regular brisk walks are an easy and free way to get active.’","The UK has the tenth highest rate of bowel, breast and womb cancer .

A woman in Scotland has become so attached to the ewe she raised in her daughter's playhouse that she washes and blow-dries the animal's coat every day and feeds her Kit Kats and Jaffa Cakes. Ellen Henderson, 55, from Thurso, Caithness instantly fell in love with Princess Neptune when the lamb was born on April 14, 2012. She has since treated the ewe like a member of the family, allowing her to sleep in her daughter's playhouse and eat at the table at dinner time. Ellen Henderson allows her pet ewe Princess to sit at the dinner table and eat biscuits . Mrs Henderson said: 'I am absolutely addicted to her - she is part of the family. 'It's a pantomime whenever we are with her. 'My husband pretends he doesn't care about Princess but I caught him a few times on his way home from work sneaking into the garden to give her a cuddle. Princess has grown so big she has had to move to Mrs Henderson's mother's house in Skerray, Sutherland . 'She can be an absolute diva when I am around to spoil her.' The ewe, who was named after a Grand National winner, originally looked like she wouldn't make it through the night when she was born in April 2012, but Mrs Henderson nursed her back to health and has been devoted to her ever since. The unusual house pet is doted on by her owner, who took turns hand-rearing Princess with her husband Dave for two months in their kitchen in Thurso. Princess has a very sweet tooth and is particularly partial to Jaffa Cakes and Kit Kats . Mrs Henderson said she is a 'princess' in her eyes: 'Neptune was a bit masculine so we added the Princess but as far as I'm concerned she is a princess.' She has now grown to such a healthy size that she is to big for the Hendersons' home and has had to move to Mrs Henderson's 89-year-old mother's croft in Skerray, Sutherland, but she still visits Princess every other day. The greedy ewe has a very sweet tooth, which Mrs Henderson indulges by feeding her Kit Kats and Jaffa Cakes. Princess is now living at Mrs Henderson's mother's house in Sutherland, but Mrs Henderson still visits every other day . Princess knows where the biscuit tin is and even steals the hen's food. Mrs Henderson said: 'On one occasion two visitors came round for tea and I left the room for a moment to meet the postie and when I came back I could hear laughter from the porch where Princess Neptune had jumped onto the coffee table and started eating from the sugar bowl.' 'People think that sheep are stupid but they are really clever animals. Princess nearly didn't make it when she was born in April 2012, but Mrs Henderson nursed her to health . 'When my mother was poorly one day, Princess Neptune went into the house and climbed up the stairs where she started prodding my mum in her bed. 'She even cries when we return home after going to visit her - it's heartbreaking.' When the Hendersons celebrated their 30th wedding anniversary recently, Ellen's only wish was for a portrait of Princess. Princess was allowed to roam freely around the house - she even knew where the biscuit tin was . She said: 'David asked me what I wanted as a present for our anniversary, especially as 30 years is such an important milestone. 'I didn't want a pearl necklace or a diamond ring- all I wanted was a painting of my beloved Princess. 'It really is my favourite possession - it is priceless. The artist has really captured her special look.' The painting, by local artist Angela Simpson, is now proudly displayed in their living room, so Mrs Henderson can look at Princess's picture, even when she is not with her.","Ewe called Princess Neptune nursed back to health by devoted owner .
